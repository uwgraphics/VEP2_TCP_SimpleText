TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, FRANCIS LORD VERVLAM, Lord Chancellor of ENGLAND, one
of his Majesty's most honorable Privy Council; Grace, mercy, and peace be
multiplied.
RIGHT HONORABLE:
GREAT is the excellency of the creatures of God: for God taking a view of the
works of his hands, Genesis 1. 31.
saw every thing that he made; and behold, it was very good. And amongst all
the visible creatures, greater is the excellent dignity of Man; made with an
erect body, a countenance full of majesty, and with eyes looking upward toward
Heaven, the place of his future habitation; whereas all other creatures look
downward. And in Man, far more excellent is his better part, the Soul, G^n.
1. 27.
created in the image of God; expounded by S. Paul, to be ^ph. 4* ^4.
righteousness and true holiness. God has not made us, as S. Augustine
says, Aug. Solil* q. ^^p. 7.
of that sort of creatures, which have only a being, or which have a being and
increasing; nor of that sort of creatures, which have not only a being and
increasing, but sense; but God has made Man having not only a being, and
increasing, and sense, but has made him little inferior to the Angels:
because he has given him reason and understanding to know God. And this
divine, and incorporeall substance, the Soul, is created, and infused into the
body, not only to give life, and sense, and motion to the body, and to set it
on work to perform the actions of this life; but especially, that the body
may be the souls instrument of doing good: that while we live on earth, the
whole man may glorify God, both in body and soul; as S. Paul exhorts, 1
Cor. 6. 20.
Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Gods. And these two,
the soul and body live together; but they die not together: for when the body
decays, and dies, the soul lives: yea, lives, to live with the body that
sleeps in the dust of the earth; when as at the 1 Thessalonians. 4 16.
voice of the Arch-Angell, and with the trump of God, it shall Dan. 12. 2.
awake, and rise; and then the same soul and body being united and joined
together again, shall 2 Cor. 5. 10.
appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the
things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or
bad. And seriously considering, that this is the certain state of Man; to live
here on earth, for an Job. 14. 14.
appointed time, then to die, and after that, to come to judgment, as the
Apostle says, Heb. 9. 27.
It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: as also
waighing well the ouerspreading iniquity of these last evil days; whereby not
only 2 Pet. 2. 7. 1.
the soul of many a righteous Lot is vexed, in seeing and hearing from day to
day, the filthy conversation and unlawful deeds of the wicked; but God is
greatly dishonored, his Saboth profaned, and his worship neglected: and for
neglecting the offered means of salvation, many perish, lose their souls, and
deprive themselves of the Kingdom of God; I cannot sufficiently bewail the
careless security, and the exceeding great neglect, that is in many, about the
saving of their poor souls. For, that men, endued with reason and
understanding; being wise, and careful enough for the things of this world;
should be so void of understanding, as not to provide for, and preserve the
better part, the Soul; not to prepare an habitation and resting place for the
soul in the Celestial Paradise; but carelessly to pass over their days, and
suffer their poor souls to perish everlastingly: O careless security! For
this cause, Right Honorable, I have for many years, bended my studies, and
framed my self, to 1 Cor. 1. 23.
preach Christ crucified, Heb. 6. 1.
laying the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward
God. That ^o men hearing of Christ, might believe in him; and believing in him,
might repent of their sins, redress their ways, and amend their lives; and
in all virtue, grace and goodness, be followers of Christ: and having both
faith and repentance, might be more easily stirred up to devout prayer, and
calling upon the name of the Lord, that they might be saved. And being moved,
and now at the length resolved, to bring forth some of my more private labors,
to more public view; I have like a young Merchant, adventured this my Ship
upon the dangerous seas of men's different opinions, and various conceits: and
therefore it is in danger (specially in this my first voyage) to be tossed
with some stormy winds of evil censure, and sinister interpretation. But my
comfort is this; my Ship is sound, and my commodities not corrupt: And to the
end, that these my labors may find better entertainment into whose hands
soever they shall come; I have heretofore determined, and do now presume to
dedicate them to your Honor: humbly craving your Honors favorable acceptance
of the same. I dare not say to your Honor of this my book, as the Jews said
unto Christ of the Centurion, Lu^e 7. 4.
Dignus est, it is worthy that your Honor should accept it: but I rather say
in the Centurions own words, Matthew 8. 8.
Non sum dignus, I am not worthy to be graced by your Hon. Greatness; for I
am conscious of mine own unworthiness. Neither is my book worthy, either for
sublimity of style, or eloquent phrase, or profundity of learning, to crave so
honorable patronage. The matter is it which I commend unto your Honor: The
way to the Celestial Paradise. A way, which the wise men of the world refuse
to walk in, counting it foolishness: which ignorant men dream not of,
because their eyes are blinded: which the natural man knows not, because it
is spiritually discerned: which worldly men think not of, because they are
earthly minded: which profane people despise, being irreligious: which wicked
and ungodly men regard not, because their hearts are hardened: which hypocrites
know, but will not walk in the same, except it be in the sight of men, to have
the praise of men: and wherein good men walk, but with many failings,
wanderings, and goings astray. And to the end, that the wise men of the world
may be more wise to salvation; that ignorant souls may be enlightened with the
knowledge of the truth; that the natural man may be borne again, may awake
from the dead sleep of his sins, and live the life of grace; that worldly
minded men may be less earthly, and more heavenly minded; that profane
people may be more religious; that wicked and ungodly men may come to
repentance; that hypocrites may be more zealous and sincere; and that the
godly may be more confirmed in the good way, and more encouraged to hold on the
good course which they have begun, that continuing to the end, they may be
saved; I have penned this Treatise; Declaring how a sinner may be saved, and
come to life everlasting. Which, if it may find favor in your Honors eyes,
it will be more welcome to the world, I shall be more encouraged in the work
of the Lord; and be for ever bound, to Eph^s. 3. 14.
bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in your Honors
behalf; that as the Lord of his mercy and goodness, has given you great
honor on earth, so he would graciously preserve, and increase your honor
here, and crown you with glory, honor, and immortality in the Celestial
Paradise.

Your Honors in all duty to be commanded. ROBERT WHITTELL.

TO THE CHRISTIAN READER, Grace and peace from GOD our Father, and from the
Lord JESUS CHRIST.
COurteous Reader, this Book, in my first thoughts, was intended to be but a
Manual: but my meditations enlarging themselves, it is grown to this
bigness. And now being come into thy hands, I crave of thy courtesy, two
things* to read it, and to practice it. First, to read it: and in and not well
understood, easily beget unjust censure. Thirdly, in reading it, despise not my
plain and humile 1 Cor. 2. 1, 4.
excellency of speech, nor with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in the
demonstration of the Spirit, and of power. And lastly, Matter: if I have
sometimes lighted my dark candle at the clear light of the grave Fathers, or
any of their Sons of later times; that is none other thing, then the Fathers
themselves, and after them, all learned men, which have written, almost of any
subject, have formerly used. And for my Method and manner of handling these
Treatises, of Faith, Repentance, and Prayer, I have, I confess, consulted with
many Authors; but directly followed none: my Method is mine own: for which,
I acknowledge my self bound, first to God; next, to my D. Downame B. of Derry.
Tutor, then to Art. How many learned men have been exercised in
Controversies, and have manifested the diversities of gifts upon the same
subjects? How many Commentaries, Expositions and Postills are now extant, the
later still sucking moisture and fatness from those which have gone before?
whether men exercise themselves in Controversies, Commentaries, or Treatises;
that saying of the Apostle is verified in all: 1 Cor. 12. 4.
There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. Having read it; in the
second place, I desire, practice it: The reading of good books, and not
practicing what thou read, as it may augment thy knowledge, so will it add
to thy punishment. Good Reader, I show unto thee here, The way to the
Celestial Paradise: walk in the same; that at thy last end, thou may enter
into that Heavenly Paradise. Here is the path of life, which will bring thee
into the presence of God, where there is Psalm. 16. 11.
fullness of joy, and at whose right hand there are pleasures for evermore. I
declare unto thee how thou may be saved, and come to life everlasting: O
then, I beseech thee by the mercies of God, whiles thou have time, use means
to save thy soul; and suffer not thy soul to perish, for which Christ died.
If thou have read this Book, and find thy self no whit bettered, neither
for information, nor reformation, nor consolation; then thou have read in
vain, and understood in vain, and I have bestowed on thee labor in vain:
But if thou have so read it, and understood it, as that thereby thy
understanding is enlightened, thy judgment informed, thy life amended, thy
faith stablished, thy zeal enflamed, thy conscience pacified, and thy soul
comforted; then, not unto me, but unto the LORD ascribe the glory: and this I
pray thee do; Praise thou the LORD, and pray for me.

Thine in Christ Jesus. R. W.

THE FIRST BOOK OF THE WAY TO THE CELESTIAL PARADISE. Concerning Faith in
JESUS CHRIST. Which is the first and principal means, whereby a Sinner may be
saved, and come to life everlasting.
CHAP. I. The preface: showing in general, the way to the Celestial Paradise;
and the means of obtaining everlasting life; with the division of the whole
Treatise.
I Am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Ioh. 14. 6.
says our Savior; No man comes unto the Father, but by me. The way that
leads to the Celestial Paradise, is Christ: called by the Apostle, the new
and the living way. For he says, Heb. ^0. 1^*
We have boldness to enter into the Holiest, by the blood of Jesus Christ, by
a New and Living Way; which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that
is to say, his flesh. There are many Joh. 14 2.
mansions in the Lords house which is above, in the heavenly City, the City of
God: many pleasant places, and sweet rooms, are prepared for Gods Elect; there
to solace themselves, after the manifold afflictions of this troublesome life.
But forasmuch, as the way to Heaven is not a Mat. 7. 13. 14.
broad, but a narrow way; not a soft, pleasant, delightful way, but uneven;
having many hard steps, and unpleasant paths, rough ways, and high mountains
to pass over, before we can come to the high mountain of Heaven; (for Acts
14. 22.
through much tribulation, we must enter into the Kingdom of God) for this
cause, Christ Jesus our blessed Savior, who is a Guide to the blind, and an
Instructor to the simple; stands as a Guide, at the entrance into the way of
life, and says, I am the Way, I am the true and living Way: if you know not
the way, I will be your Guide; follow me, I am the Way. If you have gone
astray, and wandered from the right way, follow me; I am the Truth: I will lead
you in the true way. And if you have gone so far in the broad way, that
leads to destruction, that you are near to the gates of death, o turn
again, I am the living Way: follow me, and I will lead you to l^fe
everlasting. So mercifully speaks our merciful Savior, to sinners that are
out of the right way: and whereas, through the disobedience of the first Adam,
the Genesis 3. 24.
entrance into the earthly Paradise was stopped, and the gate shut: the second
Adam, Christ Jesus, has given us entrance into the Holiest: He has opened the
gate of the heavenly Paradise with his own blood. Sanguis Christi est clauis
Paradisi.
The blood of Christ, is the key ^f Paradise: for we have entrance into the
Holiest, by the blood of Jesus. Christ is the Way, He is the true Way, the
new, and the living Way. Nique enim alia venten^i via est. Chrysostom. Hom. 72 in
Joh.
There is no other way, but by Christ says S. Chrysostom. Ponit tres gradu^,
ac si principium se esse dicore^, a^ m^dium and finem: vnde sequitur, ab ipso
incip^^ndum esse, in eodem pergendum, and desinendum. Calu. in Ioh. c. 14.
Christ is the Beginning, the Middle, and the End of this celestial and
heavenly Way: and therefore, whosoever will come to Heaven, must begin in
Christ, go on in Christ, and end in Christ.

Now, as the way is, so must our walking be in the way: the way is spiritual,
and our coming to God, and walking in the way to the Kingdom of Heaven, is
not with corporal and bodily feet, but with spiritual: and our spiritual
feet, on which we must walk in the way that leads to the Kingdom of
Heaven, are th^^e two; Repentance, and Prayer: and Faith is the staff to hold
us up in our heavenly journey. And he that has Faith in his heart, Repentance
in his life* and Prayer in his mouth; walks as a true Israelite, to the land
of Canaan; with his shoes on his feet, and his staff in his hand. These three
are all of absolute necessity in this our long pilgrimage to the celestial
Paradise.

No man can walk on one leg alone; and two will be weary and faint, except a
man have a staff in his hand, to case an support him, to help and further him
in his way. Repentance alone, is but as one leg to walk on; for a sinner that
has repented of his sins, and is in some measure ^eformed in his life, yet
(because no man in this life is perfectly sanctified) through ignorance, or
infirmity, and by occasion, he has his often slips, many failings, and some
falls into sin; and therefore has need of Prayer, as another leg to support
him, that he may repair, and renew his Repentance, by deuou^ Prayer,
confessing his sins, praying for the pardon of his sins, and craving aid
from above, that he may be able hence-forward to strive against his
corruptions, to overcome sin, and to walk in newness of life. And
forasmuch, as through often sinning, Devotion may wax cold, Prayer may faint,
and there may fall a drowzy security upon the soul; so that a man may wax
weary of well-doing: for this cause, a sinner has need of Faith, to purify
the heart, to stir up his Zeal and Devotion; to make him pray more
earnestly, and to cause him to walk more circumspectly, redeeming the time;
and to serve the Lord hence*forward in holiness and righteousness all the
days of his life. So then, there is but one right way to the celestial
Paradise: there is but one direct way to Heaven: and that way is Christ.
Whosoever goes out of that way, cannot come to Heaven. And our walking in that
way, is,

First, by Faith, apprehending Christ for our Justification, The parts of this
Treatise.
and applying to our selves, the promises of the Gospel made unto us in Jesus
Christ. Secondly, by Repentance, having our sins washed away in the blood of
the Lamb Jesus Christ. Thirdly, by Prayer, calling upon God in the name of
Jesus Christ.
CHAP. II. Of the order of the Treatise: showing that Faith must go before
Repentance and Prayer: upon which they depend. Proouing also, that Faith in
Christ, is a sure and certain means of obtaining salvation, and eternal life.
THe first and principal means of obtaining salvation, The order of this
Treatise.
and the most direct way that we can go to Heaven, is, by Faith in Jesus
Christ. True it is; without Repentance, we cannot be saved; and without Prayer,
we cannot come near unto God: yet, Repentance separated from faith in Christ,
is no true Repentance; no better then the Repentance of Matthew. 27. 3.
Judas: and Prayer, if it proceed not from a heart purified by faith in
Christ, is no effectual prayer; no better then the prayer of the Luke 18. 11,
11, 14.
Pharisees and Matthew. 6. 5.
Hypocrites. But true and sound Repentance, proceeds from true saving faith:
and fervent, devout prayer comes from a believing heart: as the Apostle says,
Romans 10. 14.
how shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? And that faith in
Jesus Christ, is the true and sure means, whereby we may be saved, and come
to life everlasting; may evidently appear:

First, by these Testimonies of Scripiure: the faithful and true Witness
says, Ioh. 3. 16.
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever
believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life. And again,
Verse 18.
He that believes on him is not condemned, but he that believes not, is
condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only
begotten son of God. S. Paul says thus to the Ephesians, Ephesians. 2. 8.
by grace are ye saved through faith: where, he shows that our salvation is
not of our selves, but by grace, and through faith. So speaks the Apostle to
the Hebrews, concerning the celestial rest, typed out by the rest of Canaan;
Heb. 3. 18. 19.
to whom swear he, that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that
believed not? so we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.

Secondly, by the example of the keeper of the prison, converted by Paul's
preaching unto him Jesus. He said to the Apostles, Paul and Sylas, Act. 16.
30. 31.
Sirs, what must I do to be saved? and they said, believe on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and thou shall be saved, and thy house. There was a time, when it was
said, Leuit. 18. 5. and Gal. 3. 12.
the man that does these things, shall live in them: but now in the blessed
time of the Gospel, the word of salvation, is this, Job. 3. 16. and Acts 16.
31.
he that believes shall live. It was once said, Do this, and live; it is now
said, Believe, and live. This was that word of unspeakable comfort to the
Keeper of the prison, a man in woeful case concerning his soul; for being even
at his wits end, and not knowing what to do, nor what means to use to come to
salvation, the Apostle raises him up with this Evangelical consolation,
Believe, and be saved. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shall be
saved and thy house.

CHAP. III. Containing the partition of the first book, concerning Faith in
Jesus Christ.
Having proved, that Faith in Jesus Christ, is the first and principal
means, whereby we are to be saved, and to come to life everlasting: I am now
(by Gods assistance, and through the gracious guiding of his holy Spirit) to
entreat of this subject, Faith in Jesus Christ. In handling whereof, I will
observe this order. I will show,

First, the diverse significations of the word Faith: The partition of the
first book.
and what is meant by Faith in this Treatise. Secondly, the diverse sorts and
kinds of Faith: and which is the true Faith. Thirdly, that there is but one
true saving Faith: and what it is. Fourthly, wherein true Faith consists.
Fifthly, who are partakers of the true Faith: whether all have it, or but some,
and who they are. Sixthly, the necessity of having the true saving Faith.
Seventhly, the benefits whereof they are partakers, who have the true Faith.
Eighthly, how the true saving Faith may be procured. Ninthly, how true Faith
being procured, may for ever be preserved. Tenthly, the signs and marks of
true Faith; by which, it may be known, whether a man have the true saving
Faith, whereby he may be saved, and come to life everlasting.
These are the several things necessarily to be handled in the Treatise of
Faith; of which, in their order, as I have propounded them.

And first, I will show what is meant by Faith in this Treatise.

CHAP. IV. Of the diverse significations of the word Faith, and what is meant
by Faith in this Treatise.
THe first general point in the Treatise of Faith, Faith, The diverse
significations of Faith.
in the Scriptures. Faith signifies,

First, fidelity and truth in performing of promises, and that both in regard
of God and men: of God, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 24.
Faithful is he (says S. Paul) that calls you, who also will do it. God is
faithful, that is, true in his word, he will keep his promise: if he say it,
he will do it. So also in regard of men, Faith sometimes signifies fidelity
in performance of promises one to another. So it is used in that saying of our
Savior Christ to the Scribes and Pharisees, Matthew. 23. 23.
Ye have omitted the waightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and (...).
Faith.

Secondly, the doctrine of the Gospel: so it is used by Galatians, Gal. 1. 23.
He which persecuted us in time past, now preaches the Faith.

Thirdly, that knowledge whereby a man knows how Paul to the Romans, Romans 14.
23.
He that doubts is damned, if he eat, because he eats not of Faith, for
whatsoever is not of Faith is sin.

Fourthly, a confidence and persuasion of the power Faith of those that came to
Christ, and the Apostles, diseased, and went away helped, and healed of their
infirmities. As the woman with the bloody issue, to whom Christ said, Matthew. 9.
22.
Daughter, be of good comfort, for thy faith has made thee whole. And the
Cripple whom Paul healed, concerning whom it is said, Act. 14 9. 10.
Paul perceiving that he had Faith to be healed, said with a loud voice, Stand
upright on thy feet.

Fifthly, the virtue and power of doing miracles, and S. Paul to the
Corinthians, 1 Cor. 13 2.
though I have all Faith, so that I could remove mountains: Faith to remove
mountains, is a miraculous and wonderful Faith.

Sixthly, the bare knowledge of God and his Word, I^mes, Iam. 2. 19.
Thou beleeuest that there is one God, thou do well: the Devils also believe
and tremble.

Seventhly, a belief in God, with an assent unto his Luke 8. 13.
They on the rock (or stones) are they, which when ^hey hear, receive the
Word with joy; and those have no root, which for a while believe, and in time
of temptation fall away.

Lastly, a persuasion of the mercy of God through Christ, with a particular
application of the promises of God made unto us in his Word. So used by S. Paul
to the Galatians, Gal. 2. 16.
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the faith
of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be
justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the works of the Law. And in this
last signification, is Faith to be understood in this Treatise following. For I
entreat of that Faith, by which, a sinner is justified from his sins, may be
saved, and come to life everlasting.

These diverse significations of Faith are necessary to be known, for the
understanding of the sense and meaning of those places in holy Scripture, which
mention Faith: that we do not mis-interpret the Scriptures, nor alter the
sense of the place, by mistaking the signification of Faith.

CHAP. V. Of the diverse sorts and kinds of Faith: showing also which is the
true Faith.
Having showed the diverse significations of Faith: In the second place, I am
to show the 2 The diverse sorts and kinds of Faith.
diverse sorts and kinds of Faith, and which is the true Faith.

First, Faith in regard of the circumstance of time, is 1 In regard of the
time: Twofold.
twofold. The one, is the Faith of the Fathers that lived before Christ. The
other, the faith of us, who live since Christ was made manifest in the flesh.
And although it be true, that in regard of the verity and truth of Faith; 1 Of
the Fathers before Christ.
the Faith of the Fathers that lived before Christ, and the faith of us, who
live in the time of the Gospel, be one, 2 Of us who live after Christ's
coming in the flesh.
and the same; yet it is distinguished in regard of the times; for they lived
before the incarnation of Christ, we after the manifestation of Christ, in the
flesh. They believed in Christ that was to come; we, in Christ who is already
come. They saw the promises Heb. 11. 13.
a far off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them; as Christ our
Savior says of Abraham, Ioh. 1. 56.
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad. But
we (blessed be God) have the accomplishment of Christ's coming. The same
faith, as Tho. Aquin. 12 ^. q. 103. ar. 4.
one says, is signified in diverse words, and in a diverse manner of speaking,
of us, and them: for they say, Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a
son: which is spoken of the future time; but we express the same faith in
Christ, by words of the time 2 In regard of the effect. Twofold.
past; A virgin has conceived, and has borne a son.

Secondly, Faith in regard of the effect, the operation and working of it, is
twofold: for faith is either fruitful in works, or unfruitful: when it is
fruitful in good 1 Fruitful.
works, working by love, then it is also a living faith: otherwise, it is but
a dead faith. Which difference Saint 2. Unfruitful.
James makes, Jem. 2. 17.
Faith, if it has not works, is dead being alone. Again, he says, Verse 26.
as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
And this fruitless faith, is but an unprofitable faith, as the same Apostle
witnesses, saying, Verse 14.
What does it profit my brethren, though a man say he has faith, and have not
works? can faith save him? Nay surely, that faith is but a vain faith, a
false and fained faith: but true faith is 1 Timothy 1. 5.
unfeigned: and that faith is commended by S. Paul, Gal. 5 6.
which works by love.

Thirdly, Faith in regard of the quantity, is twofold: 3 In regard of the
quantity: Two fold.
for there is a little faith, and a great faith: a weak faith, and a strong
faith. When the Disciples were afraid in the ship, by reason of the tempest,
and cried unto Christ, saying, Lord save us, we perish; he says unto them,
Matthew. 8. 26. (...).
why 1 Little Faith.
are ye fearful, o ye of little faith? in the same chapter, commending the
faith of the Centurion, he says, Verse 10.
I have not found so great faith, no not in Israel. Here is mention both of a
little faith, and also of a great faith. There is also a weak faith, and a
strong faith. Some have but a weak faith, and yet their weak faith, may be a
true faith. As in the father of the child that was possessed, who cried out
with tears, Mar. 9. 24.
Lord I believe, help thou mine unbelief. Lord I believe, but my faith is
weak, Lord strengthen my faith. And as there is a weak faith, so 2 Great
says.
there is also a strong faith: such was the faith of Abraham, of whom it is
said, that he Romans 4. 19. ^0
was not weak in faith, but was strong in faith. And if this strong faith grow
to full strength, then it is called (...).
full persuasion, and full assurance of Faith in the promises of God. As it is
said of Abraham, (...). Verse 21.
being fully persuaded, that what he (that is God) had promised, he was able
also to perform.

Fourthly, Faith in regard of the subject persons in whom it is, is fourfold.
4 In regard of the subject persons. Fourfold.


For, first, some do believe that there is a God: and do acknowledge the Word
of God, and every thing contained therein, to be true: but yet do not by
faith apply the grace and mercy of God, promised in the Gospel 1 Historical
faith. Parae. explic. catech. Vrs. par 2. q. 21. Pola. Synt. t. 2. i. 9. c. 6.
to them that believe. This is called an historical faith. For they that have
this faith, do acknowledge the History of the Bible, and all things contained
therein, to be true: by this faith, they acknowledge, that what God has done,
is true: and what he has said, and promised, shall surely come to pass: they
have a general knowledge, they have their understanding enlightened with
knowledge, but not with renewing grace, nor saving knowledge; this bare
knowledge alone, may be in Reprobates, and wicked men; yea, in the Devils. In
wicked men, for it is said of Simon that Acts 8. 13.
he believed. Did he believe? what faith had he? was it a true faith? No, his
faith was but a general knowledge, with an assent to the things which he
heard the Apostles preach, that they were true: but they wanted the true saving
faith; as appears by Peter's sharp rebuking of him, for that his Verse 21, 23.
heart was not right in the sight of God, but was (still) in the gall of
bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity: yea, this general faith is in
Devils, as S. James witnesses, Jam. 2. 19.
thou beleeuest that there is one God, thou do well; the Devils also believe
and tremble. That is, the Devils have a general knowledge of the Word of God,
and the things contained therein, and believe that whatsoever is written in the
Word of God, is true; they believe according to the Scriptures, that God is a
just God, and will punish sinners; yea, they know and believe, that God has
prepared Hell for the tormenting, not only of wicked and ungodly men, but for
the everlasting tormenting of the Devil and his Angels; this they believe, and
believing, tremble: but they want the true faith to apprehend the mercy of God
in Christ Jesus. Wherefore one says of the faith of Devils, that it is Fides
in Daemonibus coacta. Tho. 1. q. 64. ar. 2.
not voluntary, but forcibly drawn from them.

Secondly, some have not only a knowledge of the 2 Temporary faith.
Word, and doctrine delivered in the Scriptures, but do give their assent
thereunto, by open profession of the Gospel, and that with joy and delight,
but it is only Parae. explic. catech. Vrsin.
for a time: and in time of trouble and temptation, their faith fails, and
they go away, and fall back from their faith and profession. This is called a
Temporary faith, because it is but temporary; it is not permanent, it
continues not. These are resembled by the stony ground, upon which the seed of
Gods Word falls, and they receive it with joy, yet have no root in
themselves, and therefore Matthew. 13. 10, 21.
dure but for a while; for when tribulation or persecution arises, because of
the Word, by and by, they are offended; as our Savior speaks in the Parable
of the seed. And as S. Luke has it, Luke 8. 13.
for a while they believe, and in time of temptation fall away.

Thirdly, some have had power given them from above, 3 Miraculous faith.
to do wonders, and work miracles, and that by the gift of Faith: which faith
was a special gift of God, either to do some strange and extraordinary work,
Parae.
which could not be done by ordinary means; or else, a gift of foretelling
things to come, by divine revelation. By this faith, Peter restored the Acts 3.
9, 7.
lame to his limbs. And raised Acts 9. 40.
Tabitha from death to life. And by this faith, Paul healed the man that had
been Acts 14. 8, 9, 10.
a Cripple from his mothers womb. But this faith alone (though it be great in
power, and mighty in working) does not justify a sinner, nor save a soul: and
therefore, we find that wicked men, and such as have not had true saving
faith, have had power to do miracles, and to work wonders. It is held that
Judas wrought miracles, as did also the rest Pola. Synt. t. 2. l. 9. c. 6.
of the Apostles: for Christ gave this power to the Matthew. 10. 1.
twelve Disciples: and yet Judas was a Devil; and so Christ calls him, Ioh. 6.
70, 71.
Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a Devil? he spoke of Judas
Iscariot. Our Savior has told us, that very Hypocrites and wicked men may do
wonders, and will glory in the same, and plead for themselves at that great
day, what wonderful things they have done, Mat. 7. 22, 23.
Many will say to me (says Christ) in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out Devils? and in thy name
done many wonderful works? and then I will profess unto them, I never knew
you, depart from me ye that work iniquity. And S. Paul speaking of
Antichrist, says, that 2 Thessalonians. 2. 9.
his coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and
lying wonders.

Fourthly, some have faith, whereby they do not 4 Justifying faith.
only believe the Word of God to be true, and give assent thereunto with joy
for a time; but the Spirit of God works such grace in their hearts, that they
do apprehend Christ Jesus for their Justification, and are persuaded of the
mercy of God in Christ, for the remission of their sins, and salvation of
their souls; and in this faith they continue to the end: these have a true,
justifying, and saving faith. Of this faith, and the nature of it, more is to
be spoken in the next place, where I come to show what the true faith is.

CHAP. VI. Showing that there is but one true saving Faith: and what it is:
with the titles given unto it, and the properties belongging thereunto.
THe diverse sorts and kinds of Faith being made 3 There is but one true faith.
known; the order of the Treatise requires, that in the third place, I make it
manifest, that notwithstanding there be diverse kinds of faith, yet there is
but one true faith. For, concerning Faith, we are to consider two things, the
one, is touching the things about which faith is conversant, which is the
object of faith; the other, is concerning the subject persons, in whom faith
is. Faith, is (as has been showed) diversely in diverse men; some have a
great, and some a little faith: some have a strong, and some a weak faith:
some have an effectual, working faith, a living faith; and some have but an
unfruitful faith, a dead faith: some have a fained, and some an unfeigned
faith: some have but an historical, some a temporary, and some a true
justifying, and saving faith. In regard of men therefore, faith is diverse: but
inasmuch as the Cum obiectum fidei sit prima veritas, fides necessario vna. Tho
22 a. q. 4. ar. 6.
object of faith is, as one says, the first truth, because faith is conversant
about the Truth, and that there is but one Truth, from hence it is, that there
is but one true faith, by which we can be saved. This is verified by that
saying of the Apostle to the Ephesians: Ephesians. 4. 5.
one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism. And this one, true saving faith is thus
defined.

True saving faith is a gift of God, whereby we apprehend What true saving
faith is.
Christ, and his merits, for our justification, and eternal salvation. Or more
largely, thus; True saving faith is a gift of God, wrought in the heart, by the
Spirit of God, whereby we do not only assent to the Word of God, which we
know and understand, that it is true; but also being persuaded of the mercy of
God in Christ; do apprehend Christ, and apply unto our selves the promises of
the Gospel, for remission of sins, and everlasting life, through the merits of
Christ. This is the true Titles given to true saving faith.
faith: which, for the excellency of it, is called by S. Peter, 2 Pet. 1. 1.
precious Faith. It is called also saving Faith, because through it a sinner is
saved; Ephesians. 2. 8.
by grace, faith the Apostle, you are saved, through Faith. It is also called
justifying Faith: because that by this faith we are justified from our sins,
and accepted as righteous in the sight of God. Thus S. Paul speaks to the
Romans, Romans 5. 1.
being justified by Faith. And lastly, it is called Tit. 1. 1.
the Faith of Gods Elect; because it is proper to the Elect.

And in this true saving faith, there are three things Three things properly
belonging to true saving faith. Pola. Synt. t. 2. l. 9. c. 6.
necessarily required, which do fully contain the nature, and declare the
properties thereof.

The first is a knowledge of the word of God, and the promises of the Gospel.
The second, is an assent thereunto. The third, is a persuasion of obtaining
grace and mercy promised.
Touching the first; To true saving faith, there is necessarily 1 Knowledge of
the Word of God.
required a knowledge of the word of God; necessary it is, to know God, and his
son Christ Jesus whom he has sent; necessary it is to know and understand
the Articles of faith: in a word, necessary it is for every one that will be
saved, to know all things necessary to his salvation. Romans 10. 17.
Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God, as says the
Apostle; Now then, if a man know not the Word of God, how shall he believe to
salvation?

Secondly, in true faith, there is required an assent unto 2 An assent unto the
Word of God.
the Word of God; that is, to every word of God in general: and in particular,
to the promises of the Gospel, made to them that believe: because it is said;
Marc. 1. 15.
Believe the Gospel. And this assent to the word of God, and promises of the
Gospel, is to be yielded of us, not in respect of any evident reason that we
see, to cause us to assent thereunto; but in regard of the authority of God,
whose word it is: for faith is not grounded upon reason, neither is it
exercised about things visible to the eye of man, but about things invisible:
for faith, as the Apostle says, is the Heb. 11. 1.
substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen, And
therefore, whatsoever is written in the whole Word of God, we are to give
assent thereunto, and to believe it for a certain truth, because it is the
Word of God, though we see no reason to persuade us thereunto.

Thirdly, in true says, there is required a persuasion 3 A persuasion of the
mercy of God.
of the mercy of God in Christ, for the remission of sins, and everlasting
salvation, through the merits of Christ, with a particular application of the
same; whereby the true believer is persuaded, that the promises of God made in
the Gospel, to them that believe; do as well belong unto him, as unto others;
and assuredly believes, that through the merits of Christ, he himself shall
be saved. Of which particular faith, Paul speaks thus to the Galatians, Gal.
2. 20.
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives
in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the
Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. In that he speaks of his
faith in the Son of God, and says, that God loved him, and gave himself for
him, he speaks of a particular faith, applying Christ unto himself. These
are the properties of true saving faith; which being duly considered, may
serve,

First, for confutation of that Romish implicit faith; Against implicit faith.
the articles of faith in general, without a particular distinct knowledge of
what is believed: believing according to that which the Church believes. Thus
the Church of Rome leads the poor people in blindness, persuading them, that
it is sufficient for them to assent to the faith of the Church, whatsoever it
be: and to believe as their Pastors believe: though they understand not what
they believe. Yea, Bellarmine himself, a Cardinal of Rome, doubts not to
say, that justifying faith is Neque fiducia in Deo per Christum, neque vera
aliqua rerum diuinarum notitia; sed simplex s^^ merus and generalis verbi
diuini assentus. Bellar. de Justice.
neither any confidence in God through Christ, neither is it any true knowledge
of things divine, but a mere general assent of the Word of God. But I have
proved, that besides the assent that we are to give to the Word of God; in
true faith, there is required a knowledge, and understanding of the truth,
which we assent unto: yea, moreover a particular application of the promises of
the Gospel. For if a bare assent to the Word of God, without knowledge of the
same, and to believe as the Church believes, and not to inquire in particular,
what the Church believes, were sufficient to the saving of men's souls;
Wherefore then is it, that our Savior says, Ioh. 5 39.
search the Scriptures? And that S. Paul says, 1 Thessalonians 5. 20, 21.
Despise not prophesyings, prove all things, hold fast that which is good? The
Bereans are commended, not only for that, when they heard the Apostles preach,
they received the Word with readiness of mind, but also because they Acts 17.
11, 12.
searched the Scriptures datly, whether those things were so. And it follows,
therefore many of them believed. These Bereans heard the Word of the Apostles,
but they did not give assent thereunto, to believe what they heard, for a
certain truth, till they had searched the Scriptures, to see whether the
things which the Apostles preached were agreeable to the Scriptures, and then
they believed. Wherefore this implicit faith is to be rejected as unsound
doctrine: because it prefers ignorance before knowledge.

Secondly, seeing that true saving faith is not only an To have a particular
faith; applying the promises of the Gospel to our selves.
of the mercy of God in Christ, with a particular application of the promises
of Christ, and his benefits; this is profitable for instruction, to teach us,
as many as desire to be saved, not to content our selves with a general assent
to the Word of God, when (it may be) we understand it not; nor yet to rest in
the general knowledge of the Word, (which is but an historical faith) but to
labor for a particular faith; by which we may so believe the promises of God,
made in the Gospel generally to all that believe, that we can in particular
apply them to our selves: S. Paul to the Ephesians says, Ephesians. 5. 2.
Christ has loved us, and given himself for us. And to the Galatians he
says, Gal. 2. 20.
the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. The former words
are general, concerning the benefit of Christ's death and passion, to all that
believe: In the later, Paul applies the benefit of the death of Christ to
himself in particular. Whereupon, a learned Divine says, Ab universally,
quisque debet ad suum particulare hoc Christi beneficium transfer. Zanch. in
Ephesians. 5.
From the universal, every one is to b^ing the benefit of Christ's death to his
own particular; and say with Paul, Christ gave himself for me. Christ our
Savior makes an universal promise to all that believe: Joh. 3. 16.
Whosoever believes in the Son of God, shall not perish, but have
everlasting life. Now, the believing soul, having true faith in Christ,
assumes this to himself, and says, I believe in the Son of God; and
thereupon necessarily concludes the assurance of his own salvation; saying,
therefore I shall not perish, but have life everlasting. Thus, true saving
faith applies in particular, the general promise made to all that believe.
Gods general promise, is like the Kings general pardon: wherein, though no man
be named, yet any offender, when he hears the general pardon read, can say,
this clause belongs unto me, I take hold on this, I apply this to my self. So
a sinner that believes, hearing the gracious promises of God, made to sinners
that believe and repent; by faith, applies the general pardon of Gods mercy
to himself. The having of this particular faith is necessary to salvation: for
every man must be saved by his own faith: Wherefore it is said, Hab. 2. 4.
the just man shall live by his Faith, not by another man's faith, but by his
own faith. The general faith, to believe as the Church believes, to believe
as others believe, will not save the soul: but every man must believe for
himself. For this cause, in the Articles of our Faith, this word, (...), I
believe, is prefixed, or understood, to go before every article: as, I believe
in God the Father, I believe in Jesus Christ, I believe in the Holy Ghost, I
believe in the forgiveness of sins, etc. giving us thereby to understand,
that every Christian is to believe every article of the Faith, distinctly for
himself; and to apply the benefit of every article to himself. Faith i^ then
profitable, when it can apply Christ: so that a man may say with Thomas, Ioh.
20. 28.
my Lord, and my God. For true faith is as a right hand to lay hold on Christ;
as the eye to look unto Christ; yea, the very life of the soul, whereby we
live in Christ: for we Gal. 2. 20.
live by the faith of the Son of God. Our faith whereby we apprehend Christ,
and apply him to our souls, should be such as that we may draw spiritual
virtue from Christ, grace and mercy for our sick sinful souls, as the woman
with the bloody issue, drew virtue from Christ to heal her diseased body. A
man that has a wound, cannot possibly be cured, though the Physician be never
so skillful, and the salve never so healing, except the plaster be applied,
and laid to the sore: Christ Jesus is the best Physician to cure our diseased
souls, and wonded consciences; and he has excellent healing salve, precious
balm for the curing of our souls, even his own precious blood, which he
shed for the remission of sins: but this precious balm does only help and
heal their souls, who reach forth the hand of faith, to apprehend Christ: and
do apply the merits of Christ's Death and bloodshed to their own souls.
Wherefore, let no man content himself with a general faith, but strive and
labor, yea, have a longing desire to attain to this particular faith: for
this is true saving faith, to apply Christ Jesus unto our souls, with the
merits of his death and passion.

Lastly, whereas true saving faith stands principally in the apprehension and
application of Christ; from Consolation to them that have true faith.
For by this faith, every believer receives Christ, yea, possesses Christ for
himself; as given for him, borne for him, dying for him, rising again for
him; who was delivered for his sins, and rose again for his justification:
which faith, if a man have not, he shall remain under perpetual doubtings,
and anguish of mind, torment of conscience, and terror of the judgment to
come: whereas if a Christian have true faith, and do believe God to be his
Father, Christ Jesus to be his Savior and Redeemer; he may rejoice in
tribulation and persecution; yea, by faith, get victory over temptations, and
say with the Apostle, Romans 8. 33, 34.
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that
justifies: who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that
is risen again, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession
for us. Such comfortable persuasion, and such assurance of salvation, have all
they, who have this true saving faith.

God; that there is a God; against Atheists, and such as deny God.
THe fourth thing in the Treatise of Faith, is, 4 Wherein the true s^^ing faith
consists.
wherein it consists. True saving faith, even that faith which brings eternal
life, F^des nostrain du^bus pri^^ipaliter consistit. 10. J^ ve^a Dei

stands chiefly in two things.

First, in the true knowledge of God.

Secondly, in the mystery of the incarnation of Christ: grounded upon the words
of our Savior Christ: Joh. 17. 3.
this is eternal life, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom
thou have sent. In the former part of the words, there is the true knowledge of
God, this is eternal life, to know thee the only true God: in the later part,
there is contained, the mystery of the incarnation of Christ, and Jesus Christ
whom thou have sent. And because the true saving faith, which brings life

stands in these two, the knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ, for this cause
one says, that Fides est vita aeterna. Bren. in Ioh. 17.
Faith is life eternal. Because, by faith we apprehend Christ, and possess
Christ, who is our Righteousness, our Salvation, and our Life. Again,
concerning the former; the knowledge of God; S. Paul says, Heb. 11. 6.
he that comes to God must believe that God is. Of the later, the knowledge
of Christ; our 1 In the right knowledge of the true God. Which knowledge of God
is twofold.
Savior Christ himself says, Ioh 14. 1.
Ye believe in God, believe also in me.

The first thing then, wherein true faith consists, is the right knowledge of
the true God.

Now the knowledge of God is twofold:

General, and 1 The general knowledge of God: twofold.


Particular.

The general knowledge of God is also twofold.

The first general knowledge of God, is, to know and 1 To know that there is a
God Which may be known.
acknowledge that there is a God: which general knowledge of God, men may
attain unto, not only by the clear light of the Scriptures, but by the very
light of Nature: and not only by the Word of God, but also by the works of
the Creation.

First, by the very light of Nature, men have a general 1 By the light of
Nature.
knowledge, that there is a God: for naturally, the knowledge of God is written
in the minds of men, and every man's conscience does couince him, that there is
a God: and no nation was ever so rude and barbarous, but has acknowledged that
there is a God: as some Heathen men themselves have testified. Of this general
knowledge of God, the Scripture speaks thus, Romans 1. 19.
that which may be known of God is manifested in the^, for God has showed it
unto them. Again, the Apostle says, Romans 2. 14, 15.
When the Gentiles, which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained
in the Law; these having not the Law* are a Law unto themselves, which show the
work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing
witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing, or else excusing one
another.

Secondly, men may come to this general knowledge 2 By the works of the
creation.
of God, by the works of the Creation: when men lift up their eyes toward the
Heavens, and behold the Firmament, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, those
rious lights, and consider the excellent frame of Heaven and Earth, and take a
view of the things contained therein; they may in the works of God, as in a
fair large book, read in capital letters, that there is a God which made
Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all things therein. Of which the Apostle thus
speaks to the Romans, Romans 1. 20.
The invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly
seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power
and Godhead.

The consideration of this general knowledge of that there is a God, both by
the light of Nature, Against Atheists, which deny God.
and by the book of the Creatures, may serve for the just reprehension of
Atheists, who deny God. Of which there are three sorts.

The first, are such as deny God in heart. 1 In heart.
The second, which deny God in words. The third, which deny God by their works.
Touching the first sort:

There are some so much wanting in the knowledge of God, and so far from
acknowledging the very true God, that they deny God; and though some dare not
be so wicked, to blaspheme the Deity with open mouth, to say there is no God:
yet, in their hearts they think so, and say so secretly within themselves. Of
such, it is said in the Psalms, Psalm. 14. 1.
the fool has said in his heart, There is no God.

This Atheism of the heart, is, when men conceive evil thoughts and
imaginations against God: as when they see the diverse conditions of men in the
world, and mark how some live in prosperity, and others in aduersit^; how some
flow in wealth, and others spend their days in misery; how, for the most part,
wicked men flourish, and have what their heart can wish, and good men are
afflicted; they begin to think with themselves; if there be a God, where is
his Providence, that should rule and govern all things in the world? why does
God suffer things to be so? here the fool says in his heart, there is no
God; because he cannot discern the Providence of God, which extends it self
to all things in the world: so that not so much a^ a Sparrow can fall to the
ground Matthew. 10. 29.
without your father, as says our Savior. When men see, and perceive, that
wicked and ungodly men, through pride, exalt themselves above others, and grow
to be oppressors of the poor, wronging the righteous, hurting the fatherless
and the widows: they say within themselves, where is the Justice of God? if
God be a just God, why are not such wicked men punished? why does not some
judgment fall upon such cruel oppressors? thus the fool says in his heart,
there is no God; because he has not patience to wait the appointed time of
Gods Justice, to see the end of the wicked; and to consider, that though the
wicked prosper for a time, yet the Lord has set them Psalm. 73. 18.
in slippery places, and in the end will cast them down. Further, when wicked
men commit sin, and do not feel the hand of God upon them, punishing and
plaguing them for their sins, they begin to deny the knowledge of God, and
the presence of God, and conceive wicked thoughts against God, that God sees
not, that God knows not all the wickedness that they do; and therefore, they
are bold to continue in sin, and to go on in their ungodly course of life,
and say Psalm. 10. 11.
in their heart, God has forgotten, he hides his face, he will never see it.
Again, Verse 13.
he has said in his heart, thou will not require it.

Moreover they say, Psalm. 73. 11.
How does God know? is there knowledge in the most High? now, to deny the
providence of God, the Justice of God, the knowledge of God, and presence of
God; to deny that God knows all things, and sees all things, is to deny God.

Wherefore, to the end that this sin of Atheism in the heart, may be
remedied, it behooues every one to look carefully to his heart, to watch over
his heart, that no such wicked thought against God, do arise in the heart; and
if at any time such evil thoughts do arise, to labor to suppress and beat
them down, by acknowledging Gods divine providence; that he rules and gouernes
all things in the world, and that most wisely: by acknowledging Gods Justice in
punishing sinners, and rewarding every man according to his deeds: by
acknowledging Gods omniscience, and omnipresence; that God knows and sees all
things that are done upon the face of the earth: according to that saying of
Solomon, Prou. 15. 4.
the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. And
therefore not to be so foolish, nor so sinfully wicked, as to say with the
fool (though it be) in his heart, There is no God.

The second sort of Atheists, are they which in plain 2 In words.
words deny God. The former did but think evil against God; they said but in
their heart, there is no God. But these blaspheme God with their mouths, Psalm.
73. 9.
They set their mouth against the Heavens. These kind of Atheists are a most
wicked generation, having mouths full of blasphemies, odious to God, and
hateful to good men: Traitors they are to Gods Majesty; they deny Gods
Supremacy: they deny God to be supreme Governor of the world, attributing all
things to Nature. These deserve rather to be punished, then confuted.

But if the Atheist would diligently consider the glorious Reasons against
Atheism.
frame, and orderly composing of the things in Heaven and Earth: if he would
lift up his eyes toward Psalm. 104. 24.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works? in wisdom have thou made them all.

Besides, the Atheist might know that there is a God, Exodus 3. 14.
I am: who has a being of himself, and gives being to all creatures; in whom
we live, and move, and have our being: and that must needs be God, who rules
and gouernes all things in their natural course.

Lastly, let the Atheist knock at the door of his and biting, and will give
him no rest. And his own conscience will tell him, that in all these, there is
something above nature: that there is a God, who shows his mighty power in
the clouds; and by the same mighty power, shakes the foundations of the earth:
that there is a God, who, because he is a just God, will not suffer wicked men
to go unpunished; and the gnawing worm of a guilty conscience, in the mean
time, will give the sinner no rest, but accuses him of the transgression of
the Law of God: his own conscience is as a Sergeant arresting him, and
summoning him to appear before Gods Tribunal Seat, there to answer for the
deeds that he has done. The Atheists own conscience tells him that there
is a God: so that he may say, Psalm. 58. 11.
Verily there is a reward for the righteous; verily he is a God that judges in
the earth.

The third sort of Atheists, are they, who deny God 3 By their deeds.
by their deeds; of which denying of God, S. Paul speaks to Titus, Tit. 1. 16.
They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him, being
abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. Here is
mention of denying God; but who deny him? they that profess they know God. How
may that be, that they which profess God, should also deny God? they profess
him in words, but deny him in deeds. Such Atheists as these, there were in the
Apostles time, I would there were not cause to complain of such in our time.
Many, yea, the most men profess that they know God; they acknowledge there is
a God, and they acknowledge that God is to be worshipped; yet many deny God by
their works. Consider this first in profane people: Demand of the greatest
Swearer, Prophaner of the Saboth, Quarreller, Adulterer, Drunkard, etc. whether
he know God. He will profess that he knows God: but look to his deeds, and
you shall find that they are vile and abominable: his works are such, and his
manner of life such, as if he rather thought in his heart there were no God:
neither God nor Devil, neither Heaven nor Hell. Secondly, consider this in
Hypocrites; they profess that they know God, they worship God publicly, and
it may be privately too; in the Church, and in the house; they read the
Scriptures, hear the Word, and receive the Sacraments: in a word, they will
not be behind in any outward religious duty of piety and holiness. And all
this is godly and religious. What then is wanting? one thing is wanting; the
practice of godliness: a good life, a godly conversation answerable to their
profession: this is wanting. For consider, in regard of the performance of the
duties of piety; how some do all in outward show, and for vainglory: pray
and fast, to be seen of men: and give alms, to have praise of men: consider
their works of righteousness, their dealing toward men, how far they are
from doing unto others, as they would that men should do unto them: further,
let it be observed, how diverse will take their times and opportunities, when
they are out of the company of the godly, they be for all companies; to do as
others do: to swear among Swearers, to game with Gamesters, to drink with
Drunkards, to be partakers with the Adulterers, and as the saying is, among
Good-fellowes to play the Good Fellow; to carowse and drink healths, etc. and
by these things it may evidently appear, that though they profess they know
God, yet by their works they deny him. These are no good Christians, no sound
Professors; because their words and their works do not agree together: their
conversation is not answerable to their profession: but these are Hypocrites,
yea, Atheists; denying God: They profess that they know God, but in works
they deny him.

To conclude, seeing that wicked life, and a bad conversation ranks a man,
either amongst the profane, or amongst Hypocrites, and such as deny God: my
exhortation to all that know God aright, and to those that make a good
profession, is, that of the Apostle Paul to the Philippians, y Let your
conversation be, as it becomes a Phil. 1 27.
the Gospel of Christ. And this of the first general knowledge of God.

CHAP. VIII. Showing, that there is one, only true GOD: against Idolatry.
THe second general knowledge of God, is, to 2 To know that there is one only
true God. Acknowledging the Unity of the Godhead, and Trinity of persons.
know and acknowledge that there is one God; and three persons in the Godhead:
to acknowledge the unity of the Godhead, and the Trinity of persons; the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and that every one of these three persons, is
God: to know and acknowledge, that God the Father is of himself, from
everlasting: that the Son is begotten of the Father by eternal generation:
and that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son: to believe,
that God the Father created the world: that God the Son redeemed mankind:
and that God the Holy Ghost sanctifies the Elect. This is the general
knowledge of the one only true God.

And this general knowledge of the true God, is attained unto, not by the
l^ght of Nature, nor by the works of the Creation, but by the Scriptures. The
knowledge of the true God, comes by the knowledge of the Scriptures: for the
Scriptures do show unto us, both the Unity of the Godhead, and the Trinity of
persons. That there is one God, Moses shows, saying, Deuteronomy. 6. 4.
Hear, o Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. David also speaks thus: 1
Chro. 17. 20
O Lord, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee. And S.
Paul says, 1 Cor. 8. 4.
We know that an Idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other
God but one, And concerning the Trinity of persons, S. John says, 1 Ioh. 5. 7.
There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the
Holy Ghost, and these three are one.

The consideration of this general knowledge of Against Idolatry.
the Worshippers of Idols: who, though they know and acknowledge that there is
a God; yet do not either know the true God, or knowing the true God, do not
worship him aright; but worship false Gods, and give unto creatures, the
worship which belongs to the Creator.

Wherefore, Chrysostom upon those words of our Savior Christ, Joh. 17. 3.
This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God. Has these words:
Solum verum Deum, ad eorum qui Dij non sunt, d^fferentiam inquit. Chrysostom. in
Joh. Hom. 79. Twofold.
He says, the only true God, to put a difference between the one only true
God, and those which are no Gods. Let us take a view of the kinds of Idolatry,
and then we shall see plainly, who are here justly to be reproved.

Idolatry is twofold.
The one external.
The other internal.
External, or outward Idolatry, is also twofold. 1 Outward Idolatry. Twofold.

The one is, that open, manifest, and gross Idolatry of the Gentiles, of
Heathen men, which knew not God: and therefore worshipped Idols, false gods,
instead of 1 Open and plain Idolatry.
the true God. For rather then any Nation would be altogether without a God,
they would worship those which were no Gods: as S. Paul describes the Idolatry
of the Gentiles: Romans 1. 23.
And changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to
corruptible man, and to birds, and foure-footed beasts, and creeping things.
And aagaine he says, Verse 25.
Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the
creature, more then the Creator, who is blessed forever. Whether the Gentiles
did worship false gods, or the image of their false gods; or any similitude, or
image of the true God; all was Idolatry. Of the false gods of the Heathen,
David says, Psalm. 96. 5.
All the gods of the Nations are Idols, but the Lord made the Heavens. And of
all the images of the false Gods, David also says, Psalm. 115 4, 5 6, 7, 8.
The Idols are silver and gold; the work of men's hands, they have mouths, but
they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not. They have ears, but they
hear not; noses have they, but they smell not, etc. They that make them, are
like unto them; so is every one that trusts in them. And as for the making of
any image, or picture of the true God, it is plainly forbidden: for Moses
straightly charge the children of Israel, that they make no similitude of
God, Deuteronomy. 4. 15, 16.
Take good heed unto your selves, (for ye saw no manner of similitude on the
day that the Lord spoke unto you in Horeb, out of the midst of the fire) lest
ye corrupt your selves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any
figure, etc.

The other kind of external or outward Idolatry, is 2 Close Idolatry.
a more close and covered Idolatry, pretending the worship of God: this is the
Idolatry of the Church of Rome, the Idolatry of Papists: who, although they
know, and acknowledge the true God, and worship the true God, yet, because they
do not worship him after a right manner, but otherwise then God has appointed
in his Word, they commit Idolatry. The truth of this, I confirm, by the
consideration of the manner of Gods worship appointed us, both in general, and
particular.

Touching the first; The Rule of Gods worship prescribed Ioh. 4 23, 24.
The true Worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit, and in truth: for the
Father seeks such to worship him. God is a Spirit, and they that worship him,
must worship him in Spirit and in Truth. But the Romish Church, howsoever it
may pretend the true worship of God in spirit and truth, yet they of that
Church have devised strange worship, no where commanded in Gods Word, never
approved of God: and that is, to bow down before an Image, made for religious
use: which is a plain breach of the second Commandment. And it helps them
nothing, to say, that they worship not the Image, but God in the Image: for
this was the Idolatry of the Heathen: they worshipped their Heathen Jupiter,
was Jupiter himself; but they worshipped Jupiter their god, in his Image: so
the Israelites (who had learned Idolatry of the Gentiles) worshipped God, even
the true God, in the image of the golden Calfe: for they said, Exodus 32 4.
These be thy gods, ^ Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
Now, the Israelites were not so void of understanding, to think, that the
golden calfe which Aaron had made, was the God of Israel, but they worshipped
God in the golden calfe. The truth is, there is little difference of Idolatry,
whether we worship the Idol, or God in the Idol: whether the image, or God
in the image. For in so doing, we give that honor unto the Idol or Image,
which belongs unto God, and that under color and pretense of worshipping God.
And Jehovah the Lord, who is a jealous God, cannot endure, that another should
usurp that honor which is due unto his name. Wherefore he says, Isa. 42. 8.
My glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.

Secondly, in particular, I instance in Prayer: concerning Jesus Christ; with
assurance, that he will hear our prayers, and grant our requests, which we
make in his name. For thus says our Savior Christ, Ioh. 16. 23.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my
name, he will give it you. Now, whereas they are not content with this word of
God, to pray unto God in the name of Christ, but flee to the intercession of
Saints and Angels; they worship God with a devised worship; such as God has
not commanded, neither requires. When Papists therefore bow down before an
Image, and kneel to a Cross or Crucifix, it may be said unto them, as it was
said to those hypocritical Jews, Isa. 1. 12.
Who has required this at your hand? for, as for Saints, they themseues
worship God, and Reu. 4. 10.
cast their crowns before the Throne: and therefore they will not be
worshipped. Neither will the Angels be worshipped; the Angel that appeared to
John in the Revelation, refuses to be worshipped, for when John fell down to
worship before the feet of the Angel, the Angel said, Reu. 22. 9.
See thou do it not: for I am thy fellow-seruant, and of thy brethren the
Prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: Worship God. It was
the Devil, that bad Angel, that would be worshipped; he says to our
Savior Christ, tempting him, Matthew. 4. 9.
All these things will I give thee, if thou will fall down and worship me.
But as for the good Angels, they will not be worshipped; they bid us worship
God.

This of external and outward Idolatry.

The second kind of Idolatry, is Internal and Spiritual: 2 Inward, or
spiritual Idolatry.
and that is, Idolatry of the heart. This Idolatry is committed, when we love
any thing above God, or trust in any thing more then in God, and so set up an
Idol in our hearts. This Idolatry is more general then the former; this
reaches to all sorts of people: for though a man do know the true God,
acknowledge one God in three persons, worship the true God, and abhor Idols;
though he make no Image of God, neither bow down before any Image; in a word,
though a man be no Infidel, no Heathen-man, but a Christian; no Papist, but a
Protestant; yet for all this, he may be an Idolater in heart: by seetting his
heart upon some thing that he loves, more then upon God; and by putting his
trust and confidence in some thing else more then in God. Thus the covetous man
makes an Idol of his riches and wealth, of his silver and gold. Job says, Job
31. 24.
If I have made gold my hope, or said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence.
The Apostle in plain terms, calls Coloss. 3. 5.
Covetousness Idolatry, and the Ephesians. 5. 5.
Covetous man an Idolater. The voluptuous man makes an Idol of pleasure, Lady
Pleasure is his goddess. Gluttons and Drunkards make an, Idol of their belly;
their belly is their God; so the Apostle speaks of so^^^, Phil. 3. 19.
whose God is their belly. Hereupon Chrysostom says, Varij sunt Idololatriae
modi. Chrysostom in Romans Hom. 6.
There are diverse sorts of Idolatry. One has Mammon for his Lord; another
makes his belly his God; another makes some other lust his God: and though thou
do not offer sacrifice unto these thy Gods, as the Gentiles did, yet thou
do worse, for thou sacrificest thine own soul unto them: thou bowest not
the knee to them, neither do fall down before these thy gods, to worship
them; but yet thou art obedient unto them, and art at their command: if thy
belly or thy lusts command thy service, and require to do any thing for them,
thou art ready to do it. Thus Chrysostom. Now, it stands us Christians in
hand, as we abhor Idols, for the outward; so to look to our hearts and
affections, that we do not set up an Idol in our heart: for certain it is,
we cannot both worship God, and serve Idols, whether outward or inward. Matthew.
6. 24.
No man (says our Savior) can serve two masters: ye cannot serve God and
Mammon. No man can serve God and riches, God and his pleasures, God and his
belly, God and his own lusts. The worship of the true God, and the worship of
Idols, cannot stand together. When the Philistines brought the Ark of God into
the house of Dagon, the god of the Philistines, and placed it by Dagon, 1 Samuel
5. 4.
in the morning they found Dagon fallen to the ground.

As the Ark of God and Dagon cannot stand together in one Temple; so the true
worship of God, and Idols, cannot stand together in one temple, in one house,
nor in one heart. If a Christian do truly serve and worship the true God,
with the affection of the heart; if he love God above all, trust in God alone,
and fear God with all his heart; then there will be no room to set up the
Idol of Covetousness, or Pleasure, or Lust, in the heart: these cannot agree
together.

Wherefore, if we will be true worshippers of God, we must put away all
false worship, and remove all Idols out of the heart; we must cast down the
Idol of Covetousness, the Idol of Pride, the Idol of Lust, the Idol of
Pleasure, etc: and give God l^^^e alone to sit and rule in the heart, as God:
for God and Idols cannot dwell together: as the Apostle says, 2 Cor. 5. 14,
15, 16.
What fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion
has light with darkness? and what concord has Christ with Beliall? or what
part has he that believes with an Infidel? and what agreement has the
Temple of God with Idols? for ye are the Temple of the living God, as God has
said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and
they shall be my people.

CHAP. IX. Of the particular knowledge of God; acknowledging the one only true
God, to be our God: how necessary this knowledge of God is; how profitable it
is: how dangerous to want it: and the means of obtaining it.
HItherto of the general knowledge of God.

The particular knowledge of God, is not 2 The particular knowledge of God.
only to know that there is a God, nor only to know that there is one only
true God, to acknowledge the Unity of the Godhead, and the Trinity of Persons;
but to know and acknowledge the one only What it is.
true God to be our God: that God the Father has elected us in Christ, has
redeemed us by Christ, and sanctifies us by his Holy Spirit.

To acknowledge that God the Father is our Heavenly Father, who has created,
preserved, and does continually by his providence sustain us: that God the Son
is our Savior and Redeemer: and that the Holy Ghost is our Sanctifier and
Comforter: and to know and acknowledge, that God of his mercy, through the
merits of Christ, will assuredly save our souls, and give us life everlasting.
So that a man having true saving Faith, and being endued with this true saving
Knowledge, may say unto the Lord with David, Psalm. 22. 10.
Thou art my God. Again, Psalm. 25. 2.
O my God, I trust in thee. Yea, may say with Thomas, Ioh. 20. 28.
My Lord, and my God. This is not only to Credere D^um: cred^re De^^ credere
in Deum.
believe there is a God, that God is; and that there is one God; nor only to
give credit to the word and promise of God; but this, is to believe in God,
That is, so to believe, as that every one that has true faith, can say in
particular, for himself; I believe, that the one only true God, is my God;
and therefore I trust in him, I fear him, I love him, I worship him, I call
upon him, I depend upon his providence, for temporal things; and rest upon his
mercy, for forgiveness of sins, and everlasting life. This particular
knowledge of God, is saving knowledge, bringing comfort, health, and salvation
to the soul: as our Savior says, Ioh 17. 3. In the knowledge of God four
things to be considered.
This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God. And to the end, that
we may seek after, and attain unto this saving knowledge, I will show four
things concerning the knowledge of God.

First, how necessary it is to have the true knowledge 1 The true knowledge of
God is necessary. For
of God. Secondly, how profitable it is. Thirdly, how dangerous it is to want
it. Fourthly, the means of obtaining it.
Touching the first: the true knowledge of God is necessary, for

First, God requires it. Solomon says, Prou. 3. 6.
In all thy ways 1 God requires it.
acknowledge him. David gives his son Solomon this counsel; 1 Chro. 28 9.
Know thou the God of thy Father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with
a willing mind. And S. Paul prays for the Colossians, that they might
increase in the Col. 1. 10.
knowledge of God. 2 God complains of the want of it.


Secondly, the Lord complains of the want of the knowledge of God, by Jeremy
thus, Ier. 4. 22.
My people is foolish, they have not known me. And by Hosea he says, Hos. 4
1.
The Lord has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there
is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land.

Thirdly, the Lord prefers the knowledge of God before 3 Its better then
sacrifice.
sacrifice and burnt offerings. Hos. 6. 6.
I desired mercy, and not sacrifice (says the Lord) and the knowledge of God
more then burnt offerings.

Fourthly, the knowledge of God is so necessary, that 4 Without it we cannot be
saved.
without it we cannot be saved. S. Paul affirms, that 1 Timothy 2. 4.
God will have all men to be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth.

God, who has appointed the end, has also ordained means to the end: the end
is the salvation of our souls: that is the end of our Faith, that is the blessed
end that we desire, and long for; now the means of obtaining salvation, is to
come to the knowledge of the truth: to know and acknowledge the only true God,
and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. So necessary is the knowledge of God.

For the Second; how profitable the knowledge of 2 The knowledge of God is
profitable. For
God is, appears by the benefits that come thereby. Which are specially these
two.

First, the true knowledge of God works peace and concord amongst men of
contrary dispositions; and 1 It makes peace amongst men of contrary
dispositions.
corrects the froward natures of men; making them, of fierce and wrathful,
to become gentle and patient. This was fore-shewed by the Prophet Esaias, saying.
Isa. 11. 6, 7, 8, 9.
The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, the Leopard shall lie down with the
Kid: and the Calfe, and the young Lion, and the Fatling together, and a little
child shall lead them. And the Cow and the Bear shall feed, etc. They shall
not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of
the knowledge of the LORD.

Where the knowledge of God is, it will work a great alteration and change: if
by nature men be like Wolves, given to devour and destroy their neighbors;
the the knowledge of God will cause them to cease from their rauinous, greedy
devouring of others: if they be by nature like Lions and Bears, fierce,
wrathful, bloudy-minded; the true knowledge of God will tame them, and make
them meek and gentle.

Wherefore, if any now in the time of the Gospel, be like Wolves, and Lions,
and Bears, toward their brethren and neighbors; it is, because they have not
the true knowledge of God.

But here it will be said, that some that have knowledge,

I answer; their knowledge is not sanctified: they have

Secondly, the true knowledge of God brings eternal 2 Eternal life comes
thereby.
life: so says our Savior, Ioh. 17. 3.
This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God.

The third thing concerning the knowledge of God, is, the hurt and danger that
comes through the want 3 The want of the knowledge of God, is hurtful and
dangerous: for it causes,
thereof. As the knowledge of God is necessary and profitable, so the want
thereof is hurtful and dangerous.

First, because the want of the knowledge of God causes mourning and
languishing, desolation and destruction: as the Lord shows in Hosea,
complaining that there was Hos. 4. 1, 3.
no knowledge of God in the land, he says, therefore 1 Mourning and desolation.
shall the land mourn, etc. Again he says, Verse 6.
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.

Secondly, where the knowledge of God is not, men are given over to a reprobate
mind, to do things that 2 A reprobte mind.
are not convenient. This S. Paul shows, speaking of the Gentiles, Romans 1. 28,
29.
Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them
over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient: being
filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness,
maliciousness, full of envy, etc.

Thirdly, to them that know not God, there remains 3 Punishment.
nothing but judgment, punishment, and everlasting destruction; as says the
Apostle, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 7, 8, 9.
The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in
flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the
Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting
destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.

The fourth thing concerning the knowledge of God, 4 Means whereby we may come
to the right knowledge of the true God.
is the means whereby we may come to the true knowledge of God.

That there is a God, may be known (as has been already showed) by the light
of Nature, and by the book of the Creatures: and that there is one true God, is
manifest by the Scriptures: the Word of God reuealeth the Unity of the
Godhead, and the Trinity of Persons; but to the attaining to the right
knowledge of the one only true God, by a particular knowledge, to know him to
be God unto us, to acknowledge the one only true God, to be our Lord, and our
God, (as has been formely more fully declared) there is required more then
the light of Nature. more then the book of the Creatures: and more then bare
knowledge of the Scriptures: for this particular knowledge of God, is attained
unto, partly Two.
by the Word of God, and partly by the Spirit of God: the one being an outward,
the other an inward 1 By the Scriptures.
means, to teach us the true knowledge of God.

The true knowledge of God, then is attained unto,

First, by the Scriptures: and that both by the Law, and the Gospel.

For, Per Legem cognitiopeccati nostri, per Enangelium cognitio gratiae Dei.
Zanch. de Natu. Dei. lib. 3. cap. 3.
By the Law, as one says, we come to the knowledge of our sins, and of our
misery: by the Gospel, we come to the knowledge of the grace and mercy of God
showed us in Christ Jesus. According to that saying of S John, Ioh. 1. 17.
The Law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. And to
the end, that we may come to the true knowledge of God, by the Scriptures,
there are four things necessarily required at our hands. And that by,


First, that we diligently read the Scriptures: concerning 1 Reading the
Scriptures.
which, our Savior Christ has said, Ioh. 5. 39.
Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they
are they which testify of me. This was the practice of those noble Bereans,
who having heard Paul preach unto them Jesus, A^ts 17. 11.
searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so.

Secondly, that we carefully and attentively hear 2 Hearing the Word of God.
the word of God preached. Eor Romans 10. 17.
Faith, as says the Apostle, comes by hearing, and hearing, by the Word of
God. Our Savior says, Ioh. 17. 8.
I have given unto them the words which thou gave me, and they have received
them, and have known surely, that I came out from thee, and they have believed
that thou did send me. In which words, he shows three things; first, he
gave them his Word: secondly, they received it: and thirdly, by the Word of
God, they knew God, and Jesus Christ whom he had sent.

Thirdly, that we seriously meditate upon the Word 3 Meditating upon the Word.
of God, which we have read, or heard: David says, Psalm. 119. 99
I have more understanding then all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my
meditation. By meditating upon the Word of God, he got understanding, and
attained to the true knowledge of God.

Fourthly, that we join unto all these, devout prayer: 4 Praying for a
blessing upon these means.
craving the blessing of God, in reading and hearing the Word, and meditating
upon the same. Thus the knowledge of God is attained unto by the Scriptures.

Secondly, the true knowledge of God is attained unto, 2 By the Spirit of God.
through the gracious working of the Spirit of God in our hearts; for God must
first put it into our hearts, to know him, before we can know him. As the Lord
speaks by Jeremy the Prophet, Jer. 24. 7.
I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord. Again, he says,
Ier. 31. 33.
I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts. Our
Savior Christ says, Ioh. 6. 45.
It is written in the Prophets, and they shall be all taught of God. This is
called Cognitio per gratiam. Tho. 1. q. 12. ar. 14.
knowledge by grace, or gracious knowledge; because it is wrought in our
hearts, by the Spirit of God, the Worker of grace, as the Apostle also says, 1
Cor. 2. 7, 8, 9, 10.
We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God
ordained before the world, unto our glory. Which none of the Princes of this
world knew, etc. But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard,
neither have entered into the heart of man the things, which God has prepared
for them that love him. But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit.

This of the particular knowledge of God.

Now the consideration of the great necessity of the

First, those who content themselves with the general 1 Against those that
content themselves with a general knowledge of God.
knowledge of God; that there is a God, that there is one God, that God made
all things, that God is to be worshipped, etc. but are not careful to come to
a particular knowledge of God: to know God to be their God, and so to know God,
as to believe in him, to fear him, and to love him, to trust in him, and to
depend upon him. But if we would be saved, and come to everlasting life, we
must labor to attain to a particular knowledge of God; for the bare general
knowledge of God will not save us; for even wicked men, Reprobates, yea,
Deuels, 2 Against the Romists, who will not suffer the people to read the
Scriptures in a language which they understand.
have a general knowledge of God; they know that there is a God, yea, they
know there is one God, as witnesses S. James, Iam. 2. 19.
Thou beleeuest: hat there is one God, thou do well: the Devils also believe
and tremble.

Secondly, seeing that the means of attaining to the true knowledge of God, is
(as has been showed) by the Scriptures, by reading, and hearing the Word of
God, and meditating thereon; this reproues the Romish Church, which will not
suffer the Lay People to have the Scriptures in a known tongue, nor to read
them in a language which they understand, but lock up the Scriptures from them
in a strange language; and so will not suffer the simple people to come to the
knowledge of the truth; contrary to the word of Christ, Ioh. 5. 39.
Search the Scriptures: contrary to the practice of those noble Bereans, who
Acts 17. 11.
searched the Scripture: and contrary to the doctrine of the Fathers of the
Church in former times: for Chrysostom exhorts the people to Comparate vobu
Biblia, etc. Chrysostom. in Col. 3. Hom 9.
provide them Bibles, or the New Testament; and exhorts Parents to teach
their children to sing Psalms.

Here then consider, what great wrong, and manifest injury the Romish Priests
do to the poor people: for in keeping the Scriptures from them, they take
from them both their light, and their weapons. Their light; David says, Psalm.
119. 105.
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. The Word of God,
is to a man, for the direction of his life, as a lamp, as a torch, as a light
shining before him in a dark night, to direct and guide his feet in the way
wherein he is to walk, Now, to deprive the people of the Scriptures in their
vulgur tongue, is to take away their lamp, to put out their candle, to deprive
them of the light, and to cause them walk in darkness; so the blind lead the
blind, and both fall into the ditch. This is also to deprive the people of
their spiritual armor, wherewith they should defend themselves, against the
assaults of the Devil. The Word of God is part of that armor of God appointed
for a Christian-souldier, it is his sword: so the Apostles calls it, Ephesians. 6. 17.
Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word
of God. With this sword of the Spirit, Christ our Savior ^ought against the
Devil, and overcame him; for when the Devil tempted Christ, he answered,
Matthew 4. 4.
It is written: the Word of God was the weapons wherewith he fought; by the
Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, Christ drove away the Devil:
and this sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, is appointed for eueey Christian
to take unto himself, to defend himself against his spiritual adversaries,
yea, against that great adversary of our souls, the Devil; and therefore,
whereas the Church of Rome will not suffer the Lay People to read the
Scriptures in a language which they understand, they send them to fight against
the Devil, that strong adversary, and take their weapons from them, and so lay
them open to the assaults of the Devil.

Thirdly, seeing that the knowledge of God, is (as has 3 Against those who
wilfully live in ignorance.
been showed) so necessary, so profitable, and the want thereof so hurtful
and dangerous; and that there are also means to come to the knowledge of God:
this reprooues those, who, notwithstanding these things, yet still live in
ignorance, and do not labor to come to the knowledge of the truth, that they
may be saved: though the light shine, they walk still in darkness, and
though means of salvation be offered, yet they refuse, or at least, neglect
the means; inasmuch as they do not diligently read the Scripture, nor
attentively hear the word of God preached, neither by meditation ponder it in
their hearts; inasmuch as they do not suffer it to take rooting in their
hearts, but suffer it to slip out of their minds, and do not pray unto God
for a blessing upon their hearing and reading of the Word of God. For
certainly, there is no man (having reason and capacity to understand) but
using these good means, might attain to the knowledge of God. If a man that is
as yet ignorant of the true knowledge of God, would diligently apply himself
to the reading of the Scriptures, and to the hearing of the Word read and
preached; when he has heard the Word of God, if he would lay it up in his
heart, and meditate thereon; and lastly, if he would earnestly pray unto God,
for the obtaining of the Spirit of God, to inlighten his understanding with
true saving knowledge, and that God, by his holy Spirit would sanctify his
heart, sanctify his understanding and memory: if he would, when he reads the
Scriptures, pray that God would Ephe. 1. 18.
inlighten the eyes of his understanding, and Psalm. 119. 18.
open his eyes, that he might behold wondrous things out of the law; When he
hears the word, pray, that God by his holy Spirit, would open his heart, as
he did Act. 16. 14.
Lydia's, that he might attend to the things which are spoken of the Preacher;
and when he has either heard, or read the Scriptures, pray, that he might
(with the Mother of Christ) Luke 2. 51.
keep all those sayings in his heart: by these holy, and sanctified means, a
man might attain to so much knowledge as would be sufficient for the saving of
his soul: by these means, he might be able to give an account of his Faith,
and to render a 1. Pet. 3. 15.
reason of the hope that is in him. In a word, by these means, a man may 1.
Tim. 2. 4.
come unto the knowledge of the truth, that he may be saved.

CHAP. X. Of the knowledge of Jesus Christ, General and particular; How
necessary the true knowledge of Jesus Christ is: against those which deny
Jesus Christ; by Infidelity, Heresy, and Apostasy.
HItherto of the first thing, wherein true Faith consists; the knowledge of
God.

Secondly, true, saving Faith consists in 2 In the right knowledge of the

the right knowledge of the mystery of the Incarnation of Christ: of this, our
Savior Christ himself says, Ioh. 17. 3.
this is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom
thou have sent. Again, he says to his Disciples, Ioh. 14. 3.
ye believe in God, believe also in me.

In the knowledge of Jesus Christ, I consider two things.

First, the sorts and kinds of it: Wherein, two things.
Secondly, the necessity of it.
For the first: 1 The kinds of it. Twofold knowledge of Christ.


The knowledge of Jesus Christ is twofold:
The one, corporal and external.
The other, spiritual and internal.
The corporal, and external knowledge of Christ, was, the visible seeing and
knowing of Christ, when he 1 External and visible knowledge of Christ.
was upon the earth, when he went about doing good, and preaching the Gospel
of the kingdom. Which outward seeing and knowing of Christ, of it self alone,
was not sufficient to salvation, without the spiritual seeing and knowing of
Christ by Faith. The Rulers among the Jews, and elders of the People, the
Scribes and Pharisees saw Christ in his humane shape, and knew him by his
outward appearance, they had his bodily presence amongst them, yet few of the
Pharisees and Rulers believed on him, as appears by the words of the
Pharisees to the Officers of the chief Priests, Ioh. 7. 48.
have any of the Rulers, or Pharisees believed on him? such was the corporal,
external, and visible knowledge of Christ.

The spiritual and inward knowledge of Christ, is, to 2 Internal and
spiritual knowledge of Christ.
see and know him after a spiritual manner, to see him by Faith, to see him,
and know him with the eye of the understanding. Which spiritual knowledge of
Christ, is also twofold. Twofold.


General, and

Particular.

The general knowledge of Christ, is, to acknowledge 1 General.
that the second person in Trinity, is the Son of God, and that the Son of
God, became the son of man; to acknowledge according to the Scriptures, that

Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. That he was conceived by the Holy Ghost,
borne of the virgin Marie, that he suffered death, that he rose again, etc.
Further, to acknowledge his two Natures, his Godhead, and Manhood, that he is
true God, and perfect man: to acknowledge his offices, that he is CHRIST, that
is, anointed to be a King a Priest, and a Prophet; in a word, to acknowledge
that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, and the Redeemer of mankind; all
which, is but a general knowledge of Christ.

Beside this, there is a particular knowledge of Christ, 2 Particular.
by which, we do assuredly believe, and certainly know, that Jesus Christ is
sent of his Father, not only to be the Savior of the world, and of all that
believe in him, but that he is a Savior to Us, that he is the 1. Ioh. 4. 10.
propitiation for our sins. That he was Romans 4. 25.
delivered for our offenses, and raised again for our justification.

That he has Reu. 1. 5.
loved us, and washed us from our sins, in his own blood. By this particular
knowledge, we acknowledge, that there is Act. 4. 12.
no salvation in any other; and that there is no other Name under heaven given
among men, whereby we must be saved. Yea, hereby we so know Christ, as that
every true believer does assuredly believe, that Christ is a Savior to him,
and may say in his own behalf, for himself, as Paul said for himself, Gal.
2. 20.
The Son of God loved me, and gave himself for me. This is the right
knowledge of Jesus Christ: this is that saving knowledge that brings life
eternal.

Now for the necessity thereof. 2 The necessity of the knowledge of Jesus
Christ.


The knowledge of Jesus Christ is so necessary, that

First, whosoever wants the true knowledge of Jesus Christ, he is ignorant, and
knows nothing that is profitable for his soul, although, he have the
knowledge of all arts and tongues; and whosoever has the true knowledge 1 He
that wants the knowledge of Christ is ignorant.
of Jesus Christ, is happy and blessed; he knows sufficient to make him
everlastingly blessed, though he be unskillful in Languages, and have but small
knowledge in humane learning.

When the Rulers of the people, and the Elders, had called before them Peter
and John, the Apostles of Christ and Acts 4. 13.
saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned
and ignorant men, they marueiled, and they took knowledge of them that they
had been with Jesus. Peter and John were not brought up in learning; yet
because they had been with Jesus, and had known Jesus Christ, they had better
knowledge, and more true learning, then all the Scribes and Doctors of the
Jews; so that they were able to reason and dispute with them, and overcome
them, through the knowledge of Jesus Christ. S. Paul says to the Corinthians,
1. Cor. 2. 2.
I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him
crucified. Certainly Paul was learned; for he was Act. 22. 3.
brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect
manner of the Law of the Fathers. Ho 2 Cor. 11. 5. 6.
was not a whit behind the chiefest Apostles: neither was he rude in knowledge:
Yet notwithstanding, when he comes to preach the Gospel, he does not seek his
own praise, and commendation, by affected eloquence, and ostentation of humane
learning, but so preaches Christ Jesus, as though he knew no other learning,
but Jesus Christ and him crucified.

Secondly, In regard of the excellent knowledge of Jesus 2 In regard hereof,
all things else are base and contemptible.
Christ, all things else whatsoever, are to be esteemed base and contemptible.
So says St Paul, Phil. 3. 7. 8.
What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea
doubtless, and I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the
knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all
things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.

Thirdly, without the knowledge of Jesus Christ, we 3 Without it we cannot be
saved.
cannot be saved. Our Savior says, Ioh. 10. 14.
I am the good Shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. Again, he
says, Ver. 27. 28.
my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto
them eternal life, and they shall never perish. So that the elect of God, the
true believers, which are marked and known for the true sheep of Christ, do
know Christ, they know his voice, and hear his voice, and obey his Word, yea,
they so know him, as to follow him. And to them that so know Jesus Christ, he
gives life eternal, and they shall never perish.

The consideration of this knowledge of Jesus Christ, Against those that deny
Christ.
thereof, serves to reprove those who deny Jesus Christ.

But is there any so wicked and blasphemous, to deny Jesus Christ?

Yea, S. John says, 1 Ioh. 2. 22.
Who is a lier, but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? And Jude says,
Jude 4.
There are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to
this condition, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness,
and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

And Christ is denied three ways:

By
Infidelity, Christ is denied three manner of ways.
Heresy, and Apostasy.
First, Jesus Christ is denied by Infidelity. Infidels, 1 By Infidelity.
Pagans, Heathen men do not know God, nor acknowledge Jesus Christ. The Turks
utterly deny Jesus Christ: yea, despise Christ, so that they persecute
Christians that profess the name of Christ. And therefore their religion is a
false religion, and the worshipping of God, a false worship; because they
worship God out of Christ: for S. John says, 1 Job. 2. 23.
Whosoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father. The Jews also, to
this day, deny Jesus Christ. For although it be true, that they expect the
Messiah, and look for Christ to come, yet they deny that Jesus Christ which
was borne of the Virgin Mary, and suffered under Pontius Pilate, is the
Messiah: this they constantly deny. And to deny this, is to deny Jesus Christ.
As S. John also says, 1 Ioh. 2. 22.
Who is a lier, but he that denies that Jesus is Christ? Again, S. John
says, 1 Ioh. 4. 2, 3.
Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of
God. And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh, is not of God.

Thus Infidels, Turks, and Jews, deny Jesus Christ.

Secondly, Jesus Christ is denied by heresy. Heretics 2 By Heresy.
deny Jesus Christ, by erring from the truth; some, denying the natures, and
some, the offices of Christ.

First, concerning the natures of Christ. 1 Denying the natures of Christ: his
Godhead and Man hood.


The Person of Christ, is one: in which there are two natures: the Godhead,
and Manhood of Christ: whereby, Christ is God and Man, true God, and perfect
man: as he is the Son of God, he is true God; equal to the Father: for S.
John says, Ioh. 1. 1.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God. And as he is the son of man, he is true man: for as the Apostle says,
Heb. 2. 16.
He took not on him the nature of Angels; but he took on him the seed of
Abraham. And these two natures of Christ, the Godhead and Manhood, make but
one Person, CHRIST, God and Man. And these two natures are not turned one into
another, neither are they separated and divided one from another, nor
confounded one with another; but these two natures are united together, by an
Hypostaticall Union: Which Vnio est personalis, non personarum: and naturarum
est union, non naturalis, sed omnino supernaturaliis. Pola. Synt. t. 2. l. 6.
c. 16.
Union is personal, but it is not a union of persons: and it is a union of the
natures of Christ, but yet is it no natural union, but altogether
supernatural. And notwithstanding that these two natures of Christ be united
togethed, yet are they distinguished: there remain in one Person, Christ, two
distinct natures, the Godhead, and Manhood: so that the Godhead of Christ
has all the essential properties belonging to the divine nature; and the
Manhood of Christ retains all the natural properties, which are properly
belonging to the humane nature. But contrary to this received truth, concerning
the natures of Christ; certain Heretics have risen, who have denied, some the
Godhead of Christ, as Ruffin. lib. 1. ^ cap. 1.
Arrius, who denied that the Son of God was of the same substance with the
Father: who was condemned by the first Council. Nicaen. 1.
Niceno Council; where it was concluded and decreed, that Christ the Son of
God was (...). Ruff. li^. 1. cap. 5.
of the same substance with the Father, equal to the Father touching his
Godhead. Some Heretics have denied the true Manhood of Christ: Sozom. lib.
6. cap. 27.
Apollinarius held that Christ did not take a true body of the Virgin Mary his
mother, but that he had it from eternity. Euagr. l. 1. c. 2.
Nestorius divided the natures of Christ, the Godhead from the manhood; who
was condemned by the Council. Ephesin.
Ephesine Council. And Eutyches, another Heretic, confounded the natures of
Christ: affirming that Christ, after the assumption of the humane nature, had
no more two natures, but one: who was condemned by the Council. Chalced.
Chalcedon Council.

Now these Heretics, and all that hold of their part, in that they deny either
the God head, or the Manhood of Christ; in that they either divide, or confound
the natures of Christ; they err from the true faith of Jesus Christ: they do
not believe aright, concerning the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

And, in that they deny the Godhead, or Manhood of Christ, in that they
divide, or confound his natures, they deny Jesus Christ.

And as Heretics have erred from the truth, touching 2 Denying the offices of
Christ.
the natures of Christ; so also some have erred from the truth, concerning the
offices of Christ.

The offices of Christ are three: for he is CHRIST, that is, anointed a King, a
Priest, and a Prophet to his Church.

The errors concerning the offices of Christ, are in the Romish Church: true
it is; the Romists, in words, confess Christ to be a King, a Priest, and a
Prophet; yet, in deed and in truth, by their doctrine and practice, they deny
his offices: for confirmation hereof: Of


First, concerning the regal or kingly office of Christ: 1 A King.
we hold, that Christ is a King, and therefore has absolute rule and power
over his Church; he rules in the hearts and consciences of men, by the scepter
of his Word, and by his boly Spirit: he only has power to make laws, to
bind the conscience: but contrary to this, the Church of Rome holds that the
Pope has power to make laws, to bind the consciences of men, and that in
things pertaining to Bellarm. de Pontif. lib. 4.
Faith and Christian life.

Secondly, for the Priesthood of Christ; they confess Christ, as we do, to be
a Priest for ever after the order of 2 A Priest.
Melchisedech: but yet oppugn the Priesthood of Christ, specially in three
things.

First, by offering in the Mass, an B^llar. de sa-Miss. lib. 5.
unbloody sacrifice for sin; and this is done often; whereas the Apostle
says, Heb. 9 28.
Christ was but once offered to bear the sins of many. Again he says, Heb.
10. 10.
We are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for
all. And again, Verse 14.
by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.

Secondly, by humane satisfacttion; this was a part o^ Christ's Priestly office,
to satisfy for out sins: Now the Romish Church teaches, that
notwithstanding Christ has suffered and B^llar. de satisfact. lib. 4.
satisfied for us, to save us from eternal punishment, yet we our selves must
satisfy for our sins, by our good works, by fasting and almesdeedes, etc. for
our temporal punishment. This is also against the truth of Gods Word; for we
hold according to the Scriptures, that Jesus Christ, alone, and once, and that
perfectly, has satisfied the Justice of God, both for our sins, and for the
punishment due to our sins. As S. John says, 1 Ioh. 1. 7.
The blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanses us from all sin. And the Lord
has made a promise, that Ezekiel. 18. 21. 22.
if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, they
shall not be mentioned unto him.

Thirdly, by making Saints their Intercessours. It belongs Christ's office, to
make intercession for us. So the Scripture witnesses; S. Paul says, Romans 8.
34.
Christ died, yea rather, is risen again, who is even at the right hand of
God. who also makes Intercession for us. But the Church of Rome appoints
other intercessours besides Christ: they flee to the mediation of Saints, and
pray to Saints, that they would make request for them; whereas Christ is our
alone Mediator, as the Apostle says, 1 Timothy 2. 5.
There is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.

Thirdly, concerning the Prophetical office of Christ; as he is a Prophet, he
is the Instructor and Teacher of 3 A Prophet.
his Church, by his Spirit, and written Word: for his Word is his will; and his
Word ought to be our Rule, in matters both of faith and godly life: but the
Church of Rome, besides the Scriptures, and Word of God, brings in a heap of
humane Traditions, which their Doctors and Teachers, will have to be received
as Traditiones simpliciter necessariae sunt. Bellar. de Tradit.
simply necessary: holding that all things needful to faith, and a Christian
life, are not contained in the Scriptures, but that we must seek many things
from Traditions: whereas we hold, that whatsoever is necessary to salvation, to
faith, and a godly life, is contained in the Scriptures, even in the written
Word of God, either expressly, or so, as may rightly be collected and gathered
from the Scriptures. According to that saying of S. Paul to Timothy, 2 Timothy 3.
16, 17.
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of
God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. Wherefore, if we
will hold the truth, concerning Christ, and his Offices, we must hold, and
acknowledge him to be a King, a Priest, and a Prophet to his Church, and that
not in word only, but also in deed and in Truth.

Thirdly, Jesus Christ is denied by Apostasy: when 3 By Apostasy. Twofold.
men fall away from the truth, which they have known and professed. And this
is twofold:

Particular, and

Universal.

The particular backsliding, and falling away, is twofold. 1 Particular
falling away. Twofold.


The one is, when a Christian, having turned from his former evil course of
life, and framed himself to live a 1 By falling into some great and grievous
sin.
godly life, and now making a profession of religion, does fall into some great
and grievous sin, whereby he does not only sin against God, but does also
offend the people of God, and gives occasion to others to speak evil of the
way of the Lord. An example hereof, is in David committing adultery with
Bathsheba, to whom the Prophet Nathan, rebuking him, says not only thus, 2.
Sam. 12. 7.
Thou art the man: thou art he that have done this wickedness, and have sinned
against God; but he says also, Verse. 14.
by this deed, thou have given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to
blaspheme. This is an evil falling away, but yet this fall is recouerable; for
David seriously repented, and was received to favor: Verse. 13.
David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said unto
David, the Lord has also put away thy sin, thou shall not die.

The other kind of particular back sliding, and falling 2 By falling from the
profession of Christ, and that two ways
away, is a falling away from the profession of Christ: and that either through

Infirmity, or

Security.

First, through Infirmity; so Peter, who had made a 1 Through infirmity.
profession of Christ, and had also boasted what he would do, and suffer for
Christ, Mat. 26. 33. 35.
though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be
offended. And again he says, though I should die with thee, yet will I not
deny thee; notwithstanding all this, fainted, and Ver. 70. 72. 74
denied Christ three times.

Secondly, through Security: falling away from a 2 Through security.
man's former zeal, and sincerity of his profession: an example hereof, we
have in the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, to whom Christ says, Reave. 2. 4.
I have somewhat against thee, because thou have left thy first love. But both
these falls are recouerable; for of Peter it is said, f he went out, and Mat.
26. 75.
wept bitterly. And to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, Christ says, Reu.
2. 5.
remember from whence thou art fallen; and exhorts him to repent, and to do
the first works.

This of the particular Apostasy, and falling away: which is only a
backsliding, and falling away in part, and that for a time.

There is also an universal falling away: and that is 2 Universal falling
away. Twofold.
also twofold.

The first, is an universal falling away form a man's former righteousness,
from his holiness of life, and godly conversation: when any one falls from
virtue, to 1 From a man's former righteousness and holiness, to profaneness
and wickedness.
vice: and from a godly conversation, to profaneness, and notorious
wickedness; this is a kind of denying Christ: yea, this is, of the servant of
Jesus Christ, to become the servant of the Devil: even as a servant which
r^fuseth to serve his own Lord and Master, but falls to his masters
adversary, and serves him, may be said to have denied his master, so they,
who (for a time) have made show of serving their Lord and Master Jesus Christ,
and afterward fall away from the service of Christ, and serve the flesh, the
world, and the Deuiil, may rightly be said, to have denied Jesus Christ: of
such St Peter speaks, showing the dangerous state of those that so fall away:
2. Pet. 2. 20. 21. 22.
If after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge
of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and
over come, the latter end is worse with them then the beginning. For it had
been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, then after
they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them.
But it is happened unto them according unto the true proverb: the dog is
turned to his own vomit again, and the Sow that was washed to her wallowing
in the mire. This is a very dangerous falling away: but yet hear, and consider
of a more dangerous backsliding, and a more fearful falling away.

The second universal falling away, is, when a man, 2 By sinning against the
holy Ghost. What it is to sin against the holy Ghost
having been inlighted by the holy Ghost, with the knowledge of God, and his
Son Jesus Christ, and having made a profession of Christ, does afterward,
deny the truth, against his own knowledge, and conscience, does maliciously
oppose himself against the known truth, and even persecute those that
profess the truth.

This is properly called the sin against the holy Sin against the holy
Ghost why so called.
Ghost: not, because sin can be so committed against the holy Ghost, but it
is also against the Father, and the Son: and when the holy Ghost is offended,
the Father is offended, and the Son is offended* for the Godhead is one. But
it is called the sin against the holy Ghost, because this sin is committed
against the proper and immedrate working of the holy Ghost: which is, to
inlighten the minds and understandings of men, with the true knowledge of God,
and his Son Jesus Christ. Now, when the holy Ghost has enlightened any one,
with the true knowledge of Jesus Christ, and afterward he so fall away from
the truth, that he deny Jesus Christ, and malicously persecute the known
truth; this, is to sin against God, and against Jesus Christ, but properly
and after a special manner, it is, to sin against the holy Ghost: inasmuch
as he sins against the immediate inlightning of the holy Ghost.

Of this sin against the holy Ghost, with the fearful state of those which
fall into this sin, the Scripture evidently speaks: the Apostle to the
Hebrews says, Heb. 6. 4. 5. 6.
It is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the
heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and have tasted the
good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they shall fall away,
to renew them again unto repentance: seeing they crucify to themselves the
Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. Again, he says, Heb. 10.
26. 27. 28. 29.
If we sin wilfully, after that we have received the knowledge of the truth,
there remains no more sacrifice for sins. But a certain fearful looking
for of judgment, and fieric indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
He that despised Moses law, died without mercy, under two or three witnesses.
Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who has
trodden underfoot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant
wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite unto the
Spirit of Grace? From which words of the Apostle, two things may be gathered,
Two things herein to be considered.


The one, is the nature and quality of the sin against the holy Ghost:

The other, is the punishment due to the same.

First, the nature and quality of this sin, is set forth by six things. 1
The nature and quality of the sin against the holy Ghost showed in six
things.


They that sin against the holy Ghost, are

1 First, enlightened with the knowledge of the truth. 2 Secondly, they have a
taste of the heavenly gift. 3 Thirdly, they are made partakers of the holy
Ghost. 4 Fourthly, they have had a taste of the good word of God. 5 Fifthly,
they have had a taste of the powers of the world to come. 6 Sixthly, after all
this, they so fall away, that they crucify the Son of God afresh, they
trample and tread under foot the blood of the Covenant, and count it an unholy
thing, and do despite unto the Spirit of Grace. Here Is the Sin.
The second thing, is the punishment which usually 2 The punishment of them
that sin against the holy Ghost.
befalls those that sin against the holy Ghost: and that is threefold.

The first, is final impenitencie: they that sin against the holy Ghost, are
stricken with a marvelous hardness of heart, so that they cannot repent, they
are past repentance: 1 Final impenitencie.
wherefore the Apostle says, Heb. 6. 4. 5. 6.
it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, etc: if they shall fall
away, to renew them again unto repentance.

The second, is, never to be forgiven: they that sin against the holy Ghost,
can have no remission, no forgiveness 2 Never forgiven.
of sins, they can have no mercy showed them: Mat. 12. 31. 32.
All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: says our
Savior, but the blasphemy against the holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto
men. And whosoever speaks a word against the son of man, it shall be
forgiven him: but whosoever speaks against the holy Ghost, it shall not be
forgiven him, nether in this world, nor in the world to come. And in St Mark
its said, Mar. 3. 29.
he that shall blaspheme against the holy Ghost, has never forgiveness. This
second punishment follows upon the first: one is the cause of the other; they
that sin against the holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, because they
have not grace to repent: true it is; the mercy of God is great, above all our
transgressions, and God denies mercy to no sinner that does truly repent: and
therefore, if a sinner, whosoever, or whatsoever he be, have grace to repent
him truly of his sins, to believe the remission of his sins, and to call
and cry to God for mercy, he may have mercy: but he that sins against the
holy Ghost, his heart is so hardened that he cannot repent, but dies without
repentance, and therefore cuts himself off from mercy, and forgiveness; and
so is the cause of his own damnation.

The third, is a miserable, and fearful end. They that 3 A fearful end.
sin against the holy Ghost, usually die a fearful and shameful death. We
have two memorable examples hereof: the one is of Judas Iscariot, one of the
twelve: who was enlightened with the knowledge of Jesus Christ, he was the
Disciple of Christ, he preached Christ, and wrought miracles in the name of
Christ; and yet afterward fell away, and that fearfully: for he betrayed
Christ for money; but what was his end? He came to a shameful end: for when he
saw that Christ was condemned, he brought again the thirty pieces of silver
to the chief Priests, and Elders, and went and Math. 27. 5.
hanged himself: and Act. 1. 18.
falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed
out, such was the shameful end of Judas. The other example, is of Julian the
Emperor, who, by reason of his great Apostasy, and falling away from the
truth, is, called Julian the Apostata. This Julian, Iuuenili aetate suxit lac
pioe doctrinae. Theo. hist. Eccles. l. 3. c. 1. 2.
in his young age, was trained up in the true Christian religion: and favored
the Christians: notwithstanding afterward, he denied the faith, fell away from
the truth, denied Christ, sacrificed to Idol, became a most sore enemy to
Christians, and a vile reproacher of the name of Christ calling him the
Galilean, and Christians Galileans; and many despitefull things did he against
the Christians and that of very hatred and malice But what end came he to? It
is recorded, that when he made war against the Persians, he was wounded, but no
man knew how his wound came: but so sore was the wound, that he died of it; and
dying, took a handful of his own blood, and cast it up into the air,
saying, Vicisti Galilae Theod. l. 3. c. 25.
O thou Galilean (meaning Christ) thou have gotten the victory. Such was the
miserable and fearful end of Julian. Be warned then, all ye that know, and
profess Christ, that ye deny not Christ. Beware of backsliding, and falling
away from the truth. Heb. 3. 12. 13.
Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief,
in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily, while it is
called to day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
And 1. Cor. 10. 12.
let him that thinks he stands, take heed least he fall.

CHAP. XI. Showing who are partakers of the true, saving Faith; whether all
have it, or but some, and who they are.
IT has been declared, wherein true, saving Faith 5 Whether all men have true
faith, or but some; and who they are.
consists. The next thing in order to be handled, which is the first general
point in this Treatise of Faith, is, concerning the persons in whom true,
saving Faith is; to know who are partakers of it, whether all men have true
Faith, or but some, and to discerue who they are.

The ground of this inquiry, is from the words of the Apostle St Paul to the
Thessalonians, 2 These. 3. 2.
All men have not Faith: that is, a^ learned (...) est fides. ^oc est non omnes
eredunt. Theo. Zanch. etc. Showed two ways.
Divines expound it, All men do not believe.

And that it may appear, who are indeed partakers of the true, saving Faith,
who do truly believe, and who not: I will show, first in the Negative part,
who have not faith: Secondly, in the Affirmitiue, who have faith.

Touching the first: Faith is not universal, nor common 1 Who have not true
faith.
to all: All men have not Faith.

This I manifest,

First, in general,

Secondly in particular.

First, in general; Reprobates have not true, saving 1 In general.
Faith. The reason whereof, is a secret judgment of God lying upon them; being
smitten with hardness of Reprobates.
heart, and blindness of mind, that they cannot believe: as St John speaks
of the incredulous Jews. Ioh. 12. 37. 38. 39 40.
But though he (that is, Christ) had done so many miracles before them, yet
they believed not on him. That the saying of Esaias the Prophet might be
fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has
the arm of the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not believe because
that Esaias said again, he has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart,
that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and
be converted, and I should heal them.

Secondly, in particular; diverse have not faith: for 2 In particular, as


First, All that are as yet adversaries to the truth, and enemies to the
Gospel of Christ, have not Faith.

Secondly, profane people, notorious wicked men, in 1 Enemies of the Gospel.
whom sin rules and reigns, have not faith.

Thirdly, hypocrites have not faith. These may have 2 Profane people.
an historical, and a temporary faith, but true, saving faith they have not.
The reason is, because as yet, and as long as they are in their natural,
unregenerate state, 3 Hypocrites.
they are without, they are not as yet in Christ, they are not ingrafted into
Christ, they are not as yet members of the mystical body of Christ, they are
not of the flock of Christ, they are not the sheep of Christ; and therefore
they do not believe in Christ. As Christ himself speaks to the unbelieving
Jews, Joh. 10 26.
Ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep. All men then have not
faith: for Reprobates have not faith: the enemies of the Gospel of Christ,
have not faith: profane people have not faith: and Hypocrites have not faith.
Thus it appears, who have not faith.

Secondly, for the affirmative; who have faith, and 2 Who have true faith.
who do believe:

Though Reprobates, adversaries to the truth, profane persons, and Hypocrites
have not faith; yet many there are, who have true faith.

This I manifest,

First, in general. Secondly, in particular.
First, in general; the Elect, and all the Elect do believe: 1 In general.
The Elect.
yea, every one of the elect Children of God has true saving faith, and do
believe according to that saying in the Acts of the Apostles, Acts 13. 48.
as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed. For this cause, true
saving faith is called the Tit. 1. 1.
Faith of Gods Elect: because it is peculiar to Gods Elect. The Elect have it,
and all, and every one of the Elect, and none but only the Elect have it.

Secondly, in particular. these have faith. 2 In particular.


First, they that are effectually called; inwardly, by the gracious working of
Gods Spirit, sanctifying their 1 They that are effectually called.
hearts; and outwardly, by the preaching of the Gospel; according to that
saying of the Apostle to the Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13, 14.
God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of
the Spirit, and belief of the truth, whereunto he called you by our Gospel.
Where sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, are means
whereby they that are truly called, come to salvation; whence it follows,
that they, and all they that are effectually called of God, have true saving
faith.

Secondly, all that are truly regenerate, and borne anew, 2 The regenerate.
have true faith; for they are Iam. 1. 18.
begotten with the word of truth. Which word of truth, is the means of
obtaining faith; as S. Paul says, R^m. 10. 17.
Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.

Thirdly, all that do truly and faithfully call upon 3 They that call upon
God.
the name of the Lord, do believe: for Romans 10. 14.
how shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed?

Lastly, they have faith, which do show forth the effects and fruits of faith
in their life, by their carefulnes 4 They that show their faith by their works.
to please God, to walk in obedience to his commandments, and to be exercised
in good works. Of this S. James says, Iam. 2. 18.
Show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my
works.

So then it appears, that although all men have not, yet some have the true
faith: though Reprobates, and the enemies of the Gospel, and profane people,
and Hypocrites, have not faith; yet many there are, that have faith. For all
the Elect, and they that are effectually called, they that are regenerate and
borne anew, they that do truly and faithfully call upon God, and they that
do show forth the fruits of their faith, by a godly life, have faith.

The consideration of this, that all men have not faith, Marvel not that
unregenerate men are so wicked.
our life, we meet with unreasonable and wicked men, and wonder at it, that men
should be so disordered, go so out of square, be so notoriously wicked, and so
unreasonable to deal with; that we cease to marvel. For, All men have not
faith. They are natural men, they do but their kind: they have not faith:
for, if they had faith indeed, they would not be so vile, so wicked and
abominable in their doings, but they would be more orderly, more reasonable to
deal with, yea, they would be of better life, and of more sober conversation.
Let us not then marvel, but rather pray, as S. Paul prays the Thessalonians
to pray for him, that we may be delivered from 2 Thessalonians. 3. 1, 2.
unreasonable and wicked men; for all men have not faith.

Secondly, the consideration of this, that though all Consolation to them that
have true faith.
for consolation. Its a good evidence to a man, concerning the assurance of his
salvation, if he be assured that he has true faith. For all men have not
faith; faith is not common to all, but proper and peculiar to the Elect.

Now then, when as a Christian, upon good and infallible ground* can assure
himself that he has true faith; he may then also safely gather assurance,
that he is of the number of Gods Elect, and therefore shall certainly be
saved: for the Elect, and only the Elect, have faith, and as many as are
ordained to salvation, do believe. From hence, the true believer, through true
saving faith, assisted by the Spirit of God, gathers the assurance of his own
salvation: and receives comfort to his soul, that he is one of Gods Elect, and
shall be saved. With this heavenly meditation, the sorrowful soul of a
sinner is refreshed with this sweet consolation, he goes away in peace, lies
down in peace, and rests in peace.

CHAP. XII. Of the necessity of having the true faith.
WHo are partakers of true saving faith, 6 The necessity of having the true
faith, which is great. For
has been declared: The next thing to be considered in the treatise of
Faith, which is in order the sixth, is the necessity of faith.

Great is the necessity of true saving Faith. For, First, true saving faith, is
the very true life of the soul: 1 Faith is the life of the soul.
without which, a man is dead, being alive: Hence it is, that St Paul speaking
of the state of the Ephesians before their conversion, and before they did
believe, says of them, that they were Ephe. 2. 1.
dead in trespasses and sins. And again, speaking of their spiritual state
by grace, after that they believed, says of them, that they were quickened.
Verse 4. 5.
God who is rich in mercy, through his great love wherewith he has loved us,
even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ. And
speaking of himself now converted, and turned unto God, now believing in Jesus
Christ, he says, Gal. 2. 20.
I live by the faith of the Son of God. Giving us hereby to understand, that
whosoever has not true faith in Jesus Christ, is dead in trespasses and
sins. And though, concerning the outward man, he may live, and move, yea,
have health and strength of body; yet notwithstanding, as long as he remains
in his natural state, whiles he is not truly converted, and turned to God,
from his former sinful life, and as long as he wants true, saving faith, he
is, concerning his spiritual state, as a dead man, having no true life of
grace in him. But on the other side, whosoever is converted and turned to God,
whosoever is crucified to the world, dead to sin, and has true, saving
faith, believing in Jesus Christ to salvation; such a one, is quickened by the
Spirit, he is now raised from the death of sin to the life of righteousness,
and now, he is no more dead, but alive: he lives by the faith of the Son of
God, so that faith is the very true life of the soul, as it were the soul of
the soul: for as the soul gives life to the body, so Faith gives life to the
soul: and as the body without the soul is dead, so the soul without faith
is dead also.

Secondly, without faith, nothing that we do, can 2 Without faith nothing
pleases God.
please God. Wherefore it is, that the Apostle says Heb. 11. 6.
Without faith it is impossible to please him. Whether therefore we fast, or
pray, or give alms, whatsoever spiritual sacrifice we offer unto God, or
whatsoever good thing we do, if we would have the Lord to accept our sacrifice
and service, and to be well pleased with our good works we must look that we
have faith; that our prayers, and thankesgiuings, almsdeeds, and whatsoever
good thing we do, proceed from a heart purified by Faith. Faith is as
necessary in our spiritual sacrifices, and good works, that they may please
God; as salt was in the sacriffces in the Leuiticall law; Where it was
commanded, that Leuit. 2. 13.
every oblation of their meat offering, they should season with salt: as salt
seasoned their sacrifices, so faith seasoneth our sacrifices: and therefore as
our Savior says to his Disciples, Mark. 9. 50.
have salt in your selves: so I say to all, have faith in your selves. For
through Faith, our works are acceptable to God, and please God; but without
faith it is impossible to please him.

Thirdly, without faith, we cannot be saved. True 3 Without faith we cannot be
saved.
faith is so necessary, that if a man have the true faith, he is saved, he
cannot perish: but if he want the true faith, he is damned, he cannot be saved.
The Scripture witnesses the truth of this. Our Savior Christ says Mark. 16.
16.
he that believes, and is baptized, shall be saved, but he that believes not
shall be damned. Again, he says, Joh. 3. 18.
he that believes on him, is not condemned: but he that believes not is
condemned already, because he has not believed in the Name of the only
begotten Son of God. So great is the necessity of true, saving Faith.

The consideration of this great necessity of Faith, is To get faith into our
hearts
by all means to get faith into our hearts. If we would have any true
assurance, that we are not still dead in sin, but are quickened by the Spirit,
and live in Christ: if we would have our works, our service, and sacrifices to
be acceptable to God; or if we would escape condemnation and come to life
everlasting; then its necessary that we labor to have true, saving Faith: for
without faith, (as I have proved) we are but dead in sins and trespasses, and
have no true life of grace in us: without faith, nothing that we do can please
God: and without faith we cannot be saved. Seeing then that faith is so
necessary, how does it stand every one in hand, to labor for true, saving
faith? The Apostle to the Hebrews says, Heb. 3. 18. 19.
to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that
believed not? So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. And
hereupon he exhorts to labor for true faith; lest wanting faith, we Heb. 4.
1. 2. 3.
come short of that everlasting rest of our souls.

When Martha had received Christ into her house, and was diligent in providing
for him; and her Sister Marie in the mean time, was sitting at Christ's feet,
hearing his word; Martha was offended, that her Sister should sit down, and
not put to her helping hand; whereupon, Martha comes to Christ, and says, Luke
10. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42.
Lord, do thou not care, that my sister has left me to serve alone? bid her
therefore that she help me. And Jesus answered, and said unto her, Martha,
Martha, thou art careful, and troubled about many things; but one thing is
needful, and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away
from her. There are many, both men and women, like Martha, ver^e busy, yea,
cumbred, and troubled about many things; the world ouercomes them, and the
cares of the world carry away their minds, that (for the most part) they
neglect that which is most needful. That one needful thing, is, with Mary to
hear the word of Christ, to get true faith, that by true faith in Jesus
Christ, our souls may be saved, and we may come to life everlasting. This one
thing is needful: and whosoever they are, that have set their hearts to seek
the Lord, to hear the word of Christ, and to get true faith, whereby they may
save their souls, they have made a good choice, they have with Mary, chosen
the better part, even that good part which shall not be taken away from them.

CHAP. XIII. Of the benefits of Faith; showing what great good comes to a
Christian, through true saving Faith.
HOw necessary true saving Faith is, has been showed.

The seventh thing in the treatise of Faith, is 7 The benefits of true faith.
Which are diverse.
concerning the benefit and good that comes thereby.

The benefits of true saving Faith, are exceeding great and many.

First, I mention the benefit of Justification. True faith, 1 Justification.
apprehending Christ Jesus, justifies a sinner in the sight of God, acquitteth
and discharges him from his sins, and causes him to be accepted righteous,
not for his own righteousness, but for the righteousness of Christ imputed
unto him. So witnesses S. Paul to the Galatiaus, Gal. 2. 16.
Knowing (says he) that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but
by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we
might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the Law.
The third and fourth chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, stand upon this
argument, affirming that we are justified by Faith, without the works of the
Law: and proouing in the example of Abraham, that righteousness is imputed
unto us by Faith.

If it be objected, that S. Paul, speaking of Justification

I answer, that not only the works which are done S. Paul writing both to the
Romans and Galatians, writes to them that had received the Gospel, and did
now believe. And speaking of Abraham's faith, says, Heb. 11. 17.
By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaak. Here was a work
pleasing God, namely, the offering of his son Isaak, when God commanded him;
and this was done by faith, when Abraham had true faith; it was a work
proceeding from faith, and a fruit of faith. But did this work of Abraham
justify him be fore God? No: Romans 4. 2, 3.
For if Abraham were justified by works, as says S. Paul, he has whereof to
glory, but not before God. For what says the Scripture? Abraham believed God,
and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

If it be further objected out of S. James, that works James says, Iam. 2. 21.
Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaak his
son upon the altar? And again, he says, Verse 24.
Ye see then, how that by works a man is instified, and not by faith only.

I answer, first, there is a twofold Justification; the one only, without
works: and so we are justified Apprehensiue.
apprehensiuely, that is, by apprehending the righteousness of Christ for our
justification: for, to speak properly, only the Righteousness of Christ does
justify a sinner; and faith is but the instrument, whereby we lay hold on the
righteousness of Christ for our justification: and of this Justification it
is, that S. Paul says, Rom 4. 3.
Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness. There is
also a Justification before men, and this, is by works proceeding from faith;
and so we are justified Declaratiue.
declaratiuely, that is, our works, proceeding from faith, do declare before
men, that we have faith: our good works declare the truth of our faith, and
manifest that our faith is not in vain. Of which later Justification, S. James
speaks, saying, Iam. 2. 21.
Was not Abraham our Father justified by works, when he had offered Isaak his
son upon the altar?

Secondly, I answer, that there is a true faith working by love, known by the
fruits of good works; and there is also a false, fained faith, a vain and
fruitless faith. The former of these is commended by S. James in Abraham's
faith, whose faith wrought with his works. Verse. 22.
See thou how faith wrought with his works? and this faith, which is a
working faith, being fruitful in good works, is that faith which we approve
and allow of: this is that faith which we maintain and defend: this is that
faith which we preach, and exhort all men to labor for. And as for the other
faith, which is without works, we do with S. Ia^es hold, that it is Verse.
17. and 20.
vain, yea, a dead faith: and therefore does not justify a sinner, either
before God or men. In brief, we hold and teach, that faith only justifies;
but yet that faith which justifies, is not alone; but has necessarily joined
unto it, the fruit of good works. For if faith want good wokes, we say with
S. James, that Verse. 26.
as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
And therefore I conclude with S. Paul, Romans 3. 28.
that a man is justified by Faith, without the deeds of the Law.

This is the first benefit of true saving faith, Justification.

The second is, Adoption: whereas by nature, we are 2 Adoption.
children of wrath; by grace, through faith in Jesus Christ, we are made
sons of God. The Evangelist S. John speaks thus of them that have true faith
in Jesus Christ: Joh. 1. 12.
as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God,
even to them that believe on his name. And S. Paul to the Galatians says, Gal.
3. 26.
Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. And this is an
exceeding great privilege: for if we be children, and sons of God, then as
the Apostle says, we are Romans 8. 17.
heirs, heirs of God, and ioynt-heires with Christ.

The third, is the purifying of the heart. Faith purifieth 3 Purifying the
heart.
the heart: S. Peter, speaking of the faith of the Gentiles, says, that God
Acts 15. 9.
put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
Matthew. 5. 8.
Blessed are the pure in heart, says our Savior, for they shall see God. Now,
Fide mundantur corda, vt possit videri Deus, Bern.
the hearts of men are purified (as one says) by faith, that they may see God.
Man, by nature, is corrupt, and the heart polluted with filthiness of sin:
which filth is not washed away but by Faith in Jesus Christ. For true faith,
apprehending Christ for justification, is a means to purify the heart: Faith
purges out the corruption and filthiness of sin: it cleanses the heart
from evil thoughts, earthly cogitations, and fleshly Iusts; it purifieth the
heart, from infidelity, superstition, ignorance; from pride, hypocrisy,
rancour, grudging, hatred, malice, and envy. For these defile a man, and make
the heart unclean, from which the heart is purified by Faith.

The fourth, is, a good and happy life: for we live by 4 A happy life.
Faith, as says the Prophet Habakkuk, Habb. 2. 4. How we live by faith.
the just shall live by his faith. Now, we live by Faith two manner of ways:
First, spiritually, concerning the soul: of which S. Paul says, Gal. 2. 20.
I live by the faith of the Son of God.

Secondly, concerning the affairs of this present life; for Faith does teach
and direct a man in the course of

Secondly, faith teaches a man to commit his ways

Thirdly, ^n afflictions and crosses, faith will teach a

Fourthly, faith will make a man depend upon the providence

The first benefit, is, victory over the world: of which, S. John says, 1.
John 5. 4.
this is the victory that overcomes the world, Victory over the world.
even our faith. Now, whatsoever is in the world, is of three sorts: it is
either about the pleasures and delights of the world, or about riches, and
wealth of the world, or about honors, and preferments in the world. Which S.
John brings to these three heads: 1. Ioh. 2. 16.
the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. Now, a
Christian has much ado to strive against these, that he be not entangled, and
overcome, either by ambitious seeking of honors, or greedy desire of profits,
or sinful delights of the pleasures of the world. But faith helps a man to
get victory over all these. An example whereof, we have in Moses, whose faith
the Apostle commending, says, Heb. 11. 24. 25. 26.
By faith, Meses when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of
Pharoahs daughter; here was his contempt of honor: choosing rather to suffer
affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
season; here, was his victory over earthly pleasures, and sinful delights.
Esteeming the reproach of Christ, greater riches then the treasures in Egypt:
here was his victory over transitory, and deceitful riches. Thus, by Faith
Moses overcame the world.

The sixth, is victory over our great adversary, the Devil. 6 Victory over
the Devil.
Of this, S. Paul says, Ephe. 6. 16.
above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench
all the fiery darts of the wicked. Where, Faith is reckoned, as a special
part of the armor of God, to defend our souls against spiritual wickedness.
And S. Peter appoints faith as a powerful means to drive away the Devil.
1. Pet. 5. 8. 9.
your adversary the Devil as aroaring Lion walks about, seeking whom he may
devour, whom resist steadfast in the faith.

The last benefit, which we receive through true faith, 7 Salvation.
is Salvation: of which says S. Paul, Ephe. 2. 8.
by grace are ye saved through faith. The promise of salvation, is made to them
that have true faith; and believe in the Son of God: as says S. John. Ioh.
3. 16.
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. This was the
comfortable saying of the Apostles, Paul and Silas, to the keeper of the
Prison: he said, Act. 16. 30. 31.
What must I do to besaued? and they said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
and thou shall be saved, and thy house. These are the benefits of true faith.

Now, seeing that the benefit of true, saving faith is so Use all means to
obtain the true faith.
great privileges thereof: seeing that through true faith we are justified;
and made sons of God, by Adoption, and grace; seeing faith purifieth our
hearts; and we live by faith; seeing faith helps us to get the victory over
the enticements of the flesh, the allurements of the world, and the temptations
of the Devil; and lastly, seeing true faith saues the soul from perishing,
and brings everlasting life: if we desire to be thus happy, and blessed; if,
of sinners, we desire to be accepted just and righteous; if, of sons of men,
and children of wrath, we desire to be sons and children of God; if we would
have our corrupt hearts purged, and cleansed; if we would so live, as to
depend, and wait upon God for a blessing upon our labors and enterprises; if
we would overcome our spiritual adversaries, the flesh, the world, and the
Devil; finally, if we would save our souls from perishing everlastingly;
then, let us every one labor for the obtaining of true, saving Faith. We know,
that a man will labor hard, and even strain himself, to obtain that thing
which he knows to be of great price, of great value, and singular worth. Such
a thing is Faith: it is very excellent, and precious: for, by Faith in Jesus
Christ, we are Act. 13. 39.
justified from all things, from which we could not be justified by the law of
Moses. And Romans 5. 1.
being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus
Christ. By true faith we are made sons of God, which is a great privilege;
for, if it be an honorable thing to be the sons of Nobles, and Princes on
earth; how honorable a thing is it to be the sons of God? yea, heirs of
God, and joint heirs with Christ? By faith we live, by faith we accomplish
great victories, by faith we fight against our spiritual enemies, the flesh,
the world, and the Devil, and overcome them; and by faith in Jesus Christ, we
save our souls from perishing. Who is he then that has any feeling of his
spiritual state, who is he that has any hope of the inheritance of the life to
come, that will not earnestly desire, and diligently seek so precious a
lewell, the rare gift of faith? And if any be enflamed with a love of this
excellent grace, and have a longing desire to obtain it; the means how true,
saving faith may be obtained, shall be showed in the next place.

CHAP. XIIII. Showing how, and by what means, true, saving Faith may be
procured.
THe eight general point in the Treatise of Faith, is, how true, saving Faith
may be procured, 8 How true faith may be obtained. By two means.
and obtained.

The means of obtaining true, saving Faith, are two.

The one, is the Efficient, the other, the Isntrumental cause of Faith.

Touching the first. The Efficient, or working cause of Faith, is God: who by
his holy Spirit, works that 1 The efficient cause of faith. The Spirit of God.
grace in the heart to believe. As witnesses St Paul to the Philippians,
saying, Phil. 1. 29.
unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him,
but also to suffer for his sake. To believe in Christ, is the gift of God. It
is God that gives grace to believe. When S. Peter made that heavenly confession
of Christ, Mat. 16. 16. 17.
Thou art Christ the son of the living God. Jesus answered and said unto him,
Blessed art thou Simon Bariona: for, flesh and blood has not reueiled it unto
thee, but my Father which is in heaaen. It was not of himself, that S. Peter
made that heavenly confession, but of God, Ioh. 6. 44.
No man can come to me, says our Savior, except the Father which has sent
me, draw him: he says Traxerit, non duxerit.
draw him, not lead him, least we should attribute any thing to man's own
power, and will, in his first conversion; for when God works this saving
grace of faith, in any one; at the same time, he moves the will of man with a
holy desire of faith, which before was unwilling; yea, God by his holy Spirit,
does inlighten the minds of men with the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and
prepares their hearts to receive the gift of faith. So that in the working of
this grace of faith in the heart, not only the gift it self is of God, but
the very preparation of the heart to receive faith, is of God also. According
to that saying of the Apostle to the Philippians, Phil. 2. 13.
it is God that works in you, both to will, and to do, of his good pleasure.

Where then is man's free will in spiritual good things? Against man's free will
in spiritual good things.
state of corruption, before his conversion, is not only like to that man in
the Gospel, wounded and Luke 10. 30.
half dead, but even Ephe. 2. 1.
dead in trespasses and sins. And therefore, as it is impossible for a dead
man to raise himself, except the breath of life be breathed into him; so it is
impossible for a sinner, yet being in his natural state of ignorance, and
unbelief, of sinfulness, and corruption, to quicken and raise himself,
except God by his holy Spirit, breath into his soul, the life of grace, and so
quicken him, and raise him up.

It is true, I confess, the Lord says to sinners, Io^l 2. 12.
turn ye to me; the Prophets exhort sinners to Hos. 14. 1. Joel 2. 13.
return unto the Lord. John Baptist says, Mat. 3. 2.
Repent ye: and Christ says, Marc. 1. 15.
Repent ye, and believe the Gospel.

But from hence, it cannot be gathered, that sinners, and unbelievers, have of
themselves a natural power to turn to God, to believe and repent. But in
these sayings, the Lord shows rather, Non quid homines p^ssint prastare, sed
quid praestare debeant.
What men ought to do, then what they can do. When the Lord says to sinners,
and unbelievers, turn unto me, repent, and believe the Gospel; he shows
unto sinners, that they ought to repent, and turn unto him; and that
unbelievers ought to believe: but to believe, to repent, and to turn to the
Lord, is not of our selves, it is of God; it is of the grace of God: as S. Paul
says, 2. C^r. 3. 5.
Not that we are sufficient of our selves, to think any thing as of our
selves: but our sufficiency is of God. This of the Efficient, and inward
working cause of Faith.

The second, is the Isntrumental cause of faith, which 2 The isntrumental
cause of faith. The word of God.
is the word of God: of this S. Paul says, Romans 10. 17.
faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. He had said before,
how shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? and how shall they
believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a
Preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be sent? And hereupon
infers, that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
Here Is the ordinary means of begetting faith. God of his mercy, sends a
Preacher to a people, the Preacher preaches Christ crucified, by preaching
Christ, the people hear of Christ, and by hearing, they believe. So then faith
comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Now, the word preached, and
heard, which is powerful to beget faith, is understood to be the whole word of
God, the Law and the Gospel: for, And that,
First, to the begetting of faith in the heart, it is necessary 1 The law.
that a sinner hear the Law, to the end that he may see and know his sins;
for Romans 3. 20.
by the Law is the knowledge of sin; and not only see, and know his sins,
but likewise the punishment due to him for his sins: which in the justice of
God, is the malediction and curse of the Law: for it is written: Gal. 3. 10.
Cursed is every one that continues not in all things, which are written in
the book of the Law to do them. Likewise death and condemnation; for the Romans
6. 23.
wages of sin is death. Yea, and to be deprived of the Kingdom of God: for
1 C^r. 6. 9.
the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. And this part of the
Word, the Law, lays open a man's sins so plain and evident, that it pricks
the heart, and wounds the conscience of a sinner; insomuch, that being truly
and thoroughly touched, with the sense and feeling of his own particular
sins, he has no peace in himself, but is disquieted in conscience; and now
he begins to think with himself, what he may do to find ease to his
conscience, and rest to his soul: an example whereof, we have in those Jews,
to whom S. Peter preached Christ crucified, and urged it upon their
consciences, that they had crucified Christ; for he says, Acts 2. 36, 37.
Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made that same
Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this,
they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the
Apostles, Men and brethron, what shall we do? they were so touched in
conscience, for their great and bloody sins of crucifying Christ, that they
knew not what to do.

Now, when the Law has thus wrough upon a sinner, humbling him and bringing
him under a sense and feeling of his sins, and the wrath of God due to him
for his sins; when he finds himself in this distressed case, and
understands in how great need he stands of 2 The Gospel.
help and comfort; then, the other part of the Word of God, the Gospel of
Christ, being preached, and heard, together with the working of the Spirit
inwardly in the heart, does open the eyes of his mind, and inlighten his
understanding, and shows unto him Christ crucified, and makes the sinner see,
and know that there is remedy to heal his sick soul, that there is salvation
to be had in Christ Jesus, and in him alone; and that Joh. 3. 16.
whosoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. This
is that word of consolation, which S. Peter gave to those Jews now pricked in
heart, wounded in conscience, and groaning under the burden of their sinnnes;
Acts 2. 38.
Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
remission of sins. And now the sinner knowing that salvation is to be had in
Christ Jesus, and that there is Acts 4. 12.
no salvation in any other; hereupon he ficeth to Christ for help and
succor: by the eye of faith he looks unto Jesus, by the hand of faith he
takes hold on Jesus, and by faith applies the merits of the death and passion
of Christ, unto his own soul: being now assured of the mercy of God, through
Jesus Christ, for the remission of his sins, and salvation of his soul. The
sinner has Acts 15 7.
heard the Word of the Gospel, and believes. Thus faith is ordinarily
procured by the Word of God.

And seeing that the ordinary means of begetting Against those that boast of
their faith, and yet contemn, and lightly regard the hearing of the Word, the
ordinary means of obtaining faith.
who despise and contemn, or greatly neglect the hearing of the Word, and yet
boast that they have faith. Diverse there are, that seldom come to the house
of God, and very seldom hear Sermons; who, if they be questioned, whether
they have faith, will not stick to answer every one for himself; yea, I have
faith, and do believe; I have a good faith to God, I hope to be saved as well
as the best, and hope to come to Heaven, as soon as they that follow Sermons.
But I demand of thee, o vain man; if thou have so good a faith, and so good
hope of salvation, how, and by what means, came thou by this thy good faith?
The Scriptures tells us plainly, that the means of obtaining faith, is, by
hearing the Word of God. And seeing thou do not frequent the house of God,
nor hear the Word of God preached (except it be at some times, and by starts)
how can it be that thou have true faith? or, if thou have it, how was it
wrought in thee? and by what means have thou obtained it? it is the great
blindness of many ignorant souls, to think they have faith, when they have
it not. And they have it not, because they do not use the ordinary means to
obtain it. I know, and deny not; God is not tied to any means; and therefore
can extraordinarily work faith in the hearts of men, even in whom be will,
according to his good pleasure: but it is not safe for any one, to venture the
salvation of his soul upon the extraordinary working of God, when as God in
great wisdom, and mercy to mankind, has appointed ordinary means to beget
faith, and to work our salvation; which ordinary means, is the hearing of the
Word: for faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.

CHAP. XV. Of the means, by which true saving Faith may be increased,
continued, and preserved.
AS Faith has it means, whereby it is begotten, and procured; so has it also
means, whereby it is nourished, increased, continued, and preserved.

This is the ninth point in the Treatise of Faith. 9 Means whereby true faith
is increased and preserved Three.


The means whereby Faith is nourished, increased, and preserved, are three.

The Word,

Sacraments; and

Prayer. 1 The Word of God. And that by.


Touching the first: The word of God is a means to increase faith: and that
diverse ways.

First, by reading the word: the diligent reading of the Scriptures, is
necessary for them that do believe, to 1 Reading the Scriptures.
the increasing and preserving of their faith. St. Paul writing to the
Colossians, who had received the faith, and did now believe, gives them
commandment, concerning the reading of his Epistle, and charge that others
should read it also. for he says, Coloss: 4. 16.
When this epistle is read amongst you, cause that it be read also in the
Church of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewise read the Epistle from Laodicea.
and S. Paul charge young Timothy, to 1 Timothy 4. 13.
give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.

Secondly, by hearing the word of God: for, as the 2 Hearing the word of God.
hearing of the word of God, is an effectual means to beget faith, so is it
also a powerful means to nourish, strengthen, and preserve faith. It is a
rule in nature, Ex ijsdem nutrimur ex quibus sumus.
we are nourished by the same things, of which we are begotten: Now
spiritually, we are begotten by the word of God, as says S. James, Iam. 1. 18.
of his own will be gate he us, with the word of truth, and therefore we are
spiritually nourished by the word of God. For this cause, the word of God is
said to be the meat of the soul: it is both milk for young babes, and strong
meat for strong men. They that are but young children in religion, babes in
grace, may suck milk out of Gods word, to nourish their souls, and they that
are strong in faith, and grown in grace, may from the word of God, receive
strong meat to strengthen them more. Of which the Apostle speaks to the
Hebrews Heb. 5. 13. 14.
every one that uses Milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness; for he
is a babe but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age. S. Peter
gives this exhortation, 1 Pet. 2. 1. 2.
Therefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisy, and enuies,
and evil speakings, as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word,
that ye may grow thereby. as a newborn babe desires the mothers breasts, and
by sucking wholesome milk out of her breasts, is nourished, and grows thereby;
so a Christian, though he be but newly begotten by the word of truth, be but a
young christian, a beginner, and be but as yet a weak christian; yet if he
diligently hear the word of God, and if his soul do earnestly desire to
suck the sincere, and wholesome milk of the word; this is a powerful means
to nourish his soul, to strengthen his faith, and make him grow in grace.

Thirdly, by divine meditation. It is noted to be a property of a godly man, to
meditate on the word of Divine Meditation.
God. Psalm. 1. 2.
His delight is in the law of the Lord, says the Psalmist, and in his law does
he meditate day and night. the word of God is compared to meat: which, to the
end that it may give nourishment to the body, its necessary, that it not only
enter into the mouth, and be chewed with the teeth, but that it go down into
the stomach and be digested: so likewise, to the end that the word of God may
give true, and substantial nourishment to our souls, its necessary, not only
that we hear the word with our outward ears, but suffer it to enter into our
heart, and inwardly digest it by meditation. It was one property of clean
beasts mentioned in the leuiticall law, to Leuit. 11. 3.
chew the cud: and he is such a clean creature, who having heard the word of
God, and committed it to his memory, does afterward meditate upon the same,
and ponder it in his mind; to the end, that his faith may be increased that he
may be nourished in the truth, and grow in grace.

Fourthly, by Godly conference: the two disciples, to 4 Godly conference.
whom Christ appeared after his resurrection, and talked with them, said one to
another, Luke 24. 32.
did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and
while he opened to us the Scriptures? the spiritual communication, and
heavenly conference which Christ had with the Disciples, did heat them
inwardly, and made their hearts burn within them: godly conference, spiritual
speech, and heavenly communication does inflame the heart, with the love of
God, does stir up the affections, and kindle good desires: yea, increases
knowledge, and strengthens faith: thus the Word of God, which begets faith,
does also increase, nourish, and preserve the same.

The second means of increasing faith, is the use, and 2 Use of the Sacraments.
partaking of the Sacraments. For,

First, the Word and Sacraments, are as the two breasts of the Church; whereout,
the faithful soul suckes spiritual 1 Nourishing the soul.
nourishment, strength of faith, and increase of grace. Baptism gives a
Christian admission and entrance into the Church of God, whereby he is
ingraffed into the mystical body of Christ, and made a member of Christ: and
by the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the members of Christ are nourished to
eternal life. Of which nourishment, received spiritually by faith, it is, that
our Savior says, Ioh. 6. 53, 54.
Except ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye have
no life in you. Who so eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal
life.

Secondly, the Sacraments are a means of increasing 2 Confirming the promises
of the Gospel.
and strengthening our faith; for they confirm the promises made unto us in
the Gospel; for which cause, they are called Seals; for like as a man, making
a grant to another in writing, of house, or lands; for the better confirmation
and strenthening of the deed, he puts to his seal; so the Lord our God, to
his gracious and merciful promises, made unto us in his written Word, has
annexed the Sacraments, as seals, to assure us of the performance of his
promises. God made great and gracious promises unto Abraham; that he would
make of him Genesis 12. 2, 3.
a great nation, that he would bless him, and in him, should all families of
the earth be blessed. That he would Genesis 13. 14, 15, 17.
give the land of Canaan to him, and to his seed for ever. Moreover, God made
a Covenant with Abraham, Genesis 17. 7.
to be a God unto him, and to his seed after him. And to the end that Abraham's
faith might be confirmed and strengthened in the promises of God, he gave him
the Sacrament of Circumcision, Verse. 10. 11.
a token of the Covenant betwixt God and him: which S. Paul calls a seal, Romans
4. 11.
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of
the faith, which he had yet being uncircumcised. So also in the new Testament,
the Lord has made a most gracious and merciful promise, that Ioh. 3. 16.
Whosoever believes in the Son of God, shall not perish, but have
everlasting life. And God, to ratify and confirm this his covenant, has
sealed it with the blood of Jesus Christ, Matthew. 26. 28.
This is my blood of the new Testament, which is shed for many, for the
remission of sins. This is the Covenant of Grace: wherein, we for our parts,
are bound to believe in Jesus Christ; and God, for his part, promises
remission of sins, and everlasting life, upon condition that we believe. And
for confirmation of this his promise, Jesus Christ has sealed the Covenant
with his own blood: by which seal of the Covenant, our faith is confirmed, and
strengthened in the assurance of the promises of salvation.

The third mean, is Prayer: S. James says, Iam. 1. 17.
Every 3 Prayer.
good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the
Father of lights. Now, faith is the gift of God, and God does not only give
grace, but likewise increase of grace, according to that saying of our Savior,
Matthew. 25. 29.
Unto every one that has, shall be given, and he shall have abundance. Now
the means to bring down from the Father of lights, both the gifts of grace,
and increase of grace, is Prayer; and therefore the means of increasing the
gift of faith, is Prayer. From hence it is, that Marc. 9 24.
the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord I believe, help
thou mine unbelief. Luke 17. 5.
And the Apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our Faith. Thus Faith is
nourished, increased, and preserved, by the threefold means of the Word,
Sacraments, and Prayer.

And seeing that faith is nourished and strengthened, Diligently and
conscionably to use the means, whereby faith is increased and preserved.
means, of reading the Scriptures, hearing the Word, meditating upon it, and
conferring about it; likewise, by the participation of the Sacraments, and by
Prayer; the consideration hereof ought to make us careful, diligently and
conscionably to use these means; if we have desire that our faith should be
increased, grow stronger, and be preserved. Fire, to the end it may burn,
must necessarily have wood, or other fuel ministered unto it; or else, by
little and little, the heat slacketh, and in the end, the fire goes out. Our
life is maintained by meat and drink, which being withdrawn, the body, for
want of nourishment, waxes faint, strength decays, and in the end, it pineth
away: such is the state of our soul; we live spiritually by the faith of the
Son of God, faith in Jesus Christ is the true life of our soul; which, as it
is begotten by the Word of truth, so is it also maintained, nourished, and
preserved by the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer: which spiritual food and
nourishment, if it be denied the soul, endangers the life of the soul.

God who has given to a man a body, has also appointed and provided means,
to nourish and sustain the body: so likewise, the Lord God, who has given
unto man a soul, has appointed him means to nourish and strengthen his
soul. Wherefore, if we would have our faith (which is the life of the soul)
nourished, increased, and preserved; we must make conscience of reading the
Scriptures diligently, hearing the Word reverently, meditating upon it
seriously, conferring about it willingly, receiving the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper frequently, and praying unto the Lord earnestly, for the increase of
faith: else, as sure as the fire, without fuel, goes out, and the body,
without nourishment, pineth away; so, without the use of these holy means, the
seeming graces of the Spirit will soon be extinguished, the soul will pine
away, and perish. Very fitly has the Apostle joined together these two
exhortations, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 19, 20.
quench not the Spirit: Despise not prophesying, Giving us to understand, that
the despising of prophesying, and contemning of preaching, is a means to
quench the Spirit. If a man should wilfully refuse his meat, and deny his body
all food and nourishment, he might be accounted a very foolish man, and one
that went about to destroy his body. So likewise, whosoever does despise the
means of salvation, and wilfully refuse the true food and nourishment of his
soul, is a very foolish man, and one that goes about to cast away and destroy
his own soul.

CHAP. XVI. Of perseverance in grace: proouing that the true, justifying faith,
cannot utterly fail; and that whosoever has true faith, cannot finally fall
away.
WHereas it has been made manifest in the former Chapter, that faith being
once begotten in the heart, is afterward nourished, strengthened, and
confirmed, yea, increased, and preserved, by diverse means; Whether true faith
may utterly fail.
faith may be so preserved, and continued, that a man may be sure it shall
continue to the end; or whether a man having true, justifying faith, may fall
away from his faith, and loose it? I answer; The elect, who are effectually
Fides in sanctis saepenumero labefactari, nunquam tamen deficere p^test. Zanch.
Miscell. de persevere. sanctor. c. 3.
faith in the Saints, and children of God, may be weakened, but their faith
cannot altogether fail nor perish. They may for a time, loose the comforts of
the Spirit, but not for ever. It is true indeed, the elect, the children of
God, do sin, and that sometimes greatly, and grievously; as David, in the
matter of Vriah the Hittite: and therefore may exceedingly weaken their faith,
and may seem to have lost faith, and grace; inasmuch as they do not feel
their wonted, sweet communion with Christ, neither perceive any powerful
working of the Spirit: which was David's case, after his sin of adultery with
Bathsheba, for, upon his repentance, he pray, thus, Psalm. 51. 10.
Create in me a clean heart, O God. And renew a right spirit within me. And
again, Ver. 12.
restore me the joy of salvation. As though (to outward seeming) grace had
been quite lost. Yet the Spirit was not altogether quenched in him, for it
stirs him up to pray, and to call upon the name of the Lord. Electi excidunt
propter peccatum gratia Dei, and fide, sed 1. non omni 2. non in perpet^um.
Pola. Synt. l. 6. c. 43.
The elect by reason of sin, do fall from the grace of God, and from faith;
but they never fall quite away from all faith, and all grace; neither do they
fall away, or loose their Faith for ever.

They that have true faith, cannot loose it totally, and They that have true
faith cannot utterly fall away. For
finally; neither can their Faith utterly fail, and perish, for these reasons.

First, their salvation is decreed in heaven, and they 1 The decree of Gods
election is sure.
have a sure foundation: the purpose of Gods election is sure and immutable:
according to that saying of the Apostle Paul, 2. Tim. 2. 19.
the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, the Lord knows them
that are his:

Secondly, they are built upon a rock, which Rock 2 They are built upon a
Rock.
is Christ, and therefore cannot fall: as our Savior says, Mat. 7 24. 25.
whosoever hears these sayings, and does them, I will liken him unto a wise
man, which built his house upon a rock, and the rain descended, and the
floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for
it was founded upon a rock.

Thirdly, they are ingrafted into Christ. Ioh. 15. 5.
I am the vine 3 They are ingrafted into Christ.
says Christ, ye are the branches, he that abides in me and I in him, the
same brings forth fruit. Yea, the faithful, the true believers are members
of Christ, and Christ is Ephe. 1. 22. 23.
the head over all things to his Church, which is his body: as long as the
branches have the vine to nourish them, they grow and flourish: and as long as
the members of the body, have the head to give them motion and strength, so
long they move, and retain strength; now, Christ is the true vine, and the
true head to the Church, to all the faithful: and therefore its impossible,
that the members of Christ should perish, or that their faith should utterly
fail, as long as they be in Christ.

Fourthly, the elect have the promise of the Lord, for the preservation of
their faith, and perseverance to the 4 They have Gods promise, not to fall away
for ever.
end: so that they cannot perish, nor their faith utterly fail. By the Prophet
Hosea, the Lord says, Hos. 2. 19.
I will betroth thee unto me for ever. By Jeremy he says, Ier. 31. 3.
I have loved thee with an everlasting love. And again he says, l I will put
my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart l Ier. 32. 4^.
from me. And Christ says, Io. 10. 27 28.
my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto
them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
them out of my hand.

Fifthly, Christ has prayed for the elect, for all that 5 Christ has prayed
for the elect, that they may persevere to the end.
shall believe in him, that their faith may not fail, but that they may
persevere and continue to the end: and Christ's prayer is effectual for all
that shall believe in him. Luke 22. 31. 32
The Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold Satan has desired to have you, that he
may sift you as Wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not;
and Christ prays unto his Father, saying, Ioh. 17. 20 21
Neither pray I for these alone; but for them also which shall believe on me
through their word: that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I
in thee; that they also may be one in us: Again, be says, Ver. 24.
Father I will that they also whom thou have given me, be with me where I am,
that they may behold my glory which thou have given me.

Sixthly, the elect are within the compass of the golden 6 The elect are within
the golden chain of salvation.
chain of man's salvation, and therefore their faith cannot utterly fail,
neither can they finally fall away. For the Apostle says, Romans 8. 30.
Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called,
them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. This
chain of man's salvation, reaches from heaven to the earth, and from the earth
to heaven again; God holds both the ends of this chain in his hands. The
first link of this chain, is Election, that is in heaven. The second, is
effectual vocation, the third, is justification, the fourth is sanctification,
these are on earth, these are the middle part of the chain, these compass in
all them that are ordained to salvation; and the fifth link of this chain, is
glorification; which end of the chain, God having in his hand; those that are
predestinate, and called, and justified, and sanctified, he draws up into
heaven, to sit there in glory; and not all the tyrants, and wicked men of the
world, nor all the Devils in hell, are able to break asunder any one of the
linkes of this chain which is in Gods hands. And therefore they that are
within the compass of this chain, are sure to be saved, and to be received up
into glory. Seeing then that the faith of Gods elect has a sure foundation,
and is as a house builded upon a Rock, seeing all the elect are ingrafted into
Christ, and are members of Christ, seeing the Lord in the Scriptures, has made
faithful promises of our perseuera^ce in faith, and that Christ himself has
made an effectual Prayer to his Father, for all that believe in him, and
seeing that all they who are elected, called, and justified, shall be
glorified; I conclude, that the faith of Gods elect can never utterly fail,
and they that are endued with true, justifying faith, shall never finally fall
away.

But against this doctrine of perseverance in grace, and the perpetual faith
of the elect, sundry objections are made, amongst which these are chief.

First, from the saying of the Prophet Ezekiel, Ez^k. 18. 26.
When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits
iniquity, etc. It is objected, that if a righteous man may turn away from his
righteousness, it seems that a man having justifying faith, may fall away. To
which, I answer two things. First, by Righteousness, in the words of the
Prophet, is not meant that righteousness righteous man turning away from his
righteousness, Mat. 9. 13.
I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. Wherefore, if any
such fall away, it is evident, that their righteousness was no true
righteousness; for he that is truly righteous, is Psalm. 1. 3.
like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in
his season, his leaf also shall not wither. The righteousness of a righteous
man, shall not utterly decay: the righteous man shall not quite fall away from
his true righteousness.

Further, an objection is made from those places of 1 Timothy, 1. 19.
holding faith and a good conscience, which some having put away, concerning
faith have made shipwreck. And again, when he says, 1 Timothy, 4. 1.
In the latter times some shall depart from the faith. And again, 1 Timothy, 6. 10.
the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some have coueted
after, they have erred from the faith. Now if a man may make shipwreck of his
faith, if he may depart, and err from the faith then it seems, that a man
having faith, may loose it, and fall away. I answer, that, by faith in those
places mentioned, 1 Timothy, 1. 19.
hold faith and a good conscience. and because they did not 1 Timothy 3. 9.
hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, but put a way a good
conscience; no marvel though their temporary faith failed; no merueile
though they erred from the truth, and so made shipwreck of faith. For as one
says well, Vt salua fides ad portum vs^ perueniat, nauigationis nustrae cursus
bona conscientia r^gendus est. Calu: in 1 Timothy 1. 19.
to the end, that we may bring the ship of faith safe to the haven, the course
of our sailing must be guided by a good conscience. And sure it is, that who
soever has received the true, and sound doctrine of the Gospel of Christ,
whereby true faith is begotten in the heart, and to that sound, and wholesome
doctrine, ioynes a good conscience, both before God, and toward men, he can
never make shipwreck of his faith. So then we may conclude, that if any fall
away from the faith, they never had true iustifiing faith: at the most, and
best, their faith was but a temporary faith; they believed for a while, and in
time of temtation fell away.

Now, seeing that the faith of Gods elect cannot utterly To make our calling
and election sure.
it teaches us, to labor to make our calling and election sure. To labor to
be sure of this, that we are in the blessed number of Gods elect, and that we
are effectually called of God: which we may know, by the works of
sanctification, and by the fruits of the Spirit. this is that whereunto S.
Peter exhorts, saying 2 pet. 1. 10.
Wherefore, the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and
election sure: for if ye do these things you shall never fall. Here is a
promise, you shall never fall. a promise, that the faith of the elect shall
never utterly fail; and therefore the Apostle exhorts, to make our calling
and election sure: let us make sure that we be elected, and called of God, and
then it is sure, we shall never fall. But how shall we know whether we be
elected, and called? the Apostle answers, If ye do these things ye shall
never fall. what things? what must we do that we may be assured of our
election, and calling, and that we shall never fall? the Apostle tells us what
things. verse. 5. 6. 7.
And besides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue; to virtue,
knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to
patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly
kindness, Charity. So that here, a christian is to try and examine himself,
whether he be such a one as shall never fall away: namely by inquiring, whether
he has faith, and virtue, and knowledge, and temperance, and patience, and
godliness, and brotherly kindness, and charity. For says the Apostle, ver. 8.
If these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be
barren, nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. And again,
ver. 10.
If ye do these things, ye shall never fall, but if a man after trial, and
examination had of himself, cannot find these things in himself, but finds
a want of faith, of virtue, and honest conversation; a want of the true
knowledge of God; a want of temperance, and sobriety; if he find in himself a
want of patience to endure affliction, and to suffer wrong; if he find a want
of godliness, of brotherly kindness, and charity; certainly, such a one is in
miserable state concerning his soul, how soever he be in regard of his outward
state in the world, for if they that do these things shall never fall, then
they that want these things shall fall, and their fall shall be great. A man
that is to purchase land, or to take but a lease of a house or ground, how
careful will he be to make all sure? for if his writings be not good, and
sufficient, he knows that all his money which he has laid out, is lost and
gone, and he is overthrown. Thus wise are men in their generation: o that we
could be as wise for the salvation of our souls, to make all sure, A man that
has land, and inheritance, has some good evidence to show for the same; so we
should labor to attain to this assurance of salvation, that we can be able to
show some good evidence for our inheritance in heaven; lest having nothing to
show, we loose our inheritance.

Secondly, seeing that the faith of Gods elect cannot Consolation to the
children of God, because their faith shall not utterly fail.
cannot finally fall away; this yeildeth exceeding great consolation to the
children of God. The faith of a Christian is not strong at all times, but
sometimes it may be very weak, and scarcely felt, as after the committing of
some great sin, or in time of sore temptation^* when as with David, a man may
be in great heaviness, his soul may be Psalm. 42. 11.
cast down; yet notwithstanding, faith is never so quenched in the true
believer, but some spark remains; yea, a seed remains, that immortal,
incorruptible seed; and that in time, will quicken, and revive. Like as a sick
man, that is brought very low with sickness; his stomach fails him, he loathes
his meat, the Physician forsaks him, and all men hold him not a man for this
world: notwithstanding while breath is in his body, there is hope and many
times, such a one reuiues, recouers, and comes to his strength again; so a
Christian, sore wounded with sin, and in grievous temptations, gives few
comfortable words, but sends forth sighs, and ^obs; and many times do proceed
from him desperate speeches, so that they that see, and hear him, might fear,
least all faith were gone; yet afterward, in time, the spark of faith is
kindled, and flameth, the immortal seed is quickened, and the Spirit puts new
life of grace into the distressed soul; making the sinner, to believe in
Christ, to hope in Gods mercy, to trust in God, to call upon God, and cry Abba
Father. To conclude, a Christian, who upon good ground, is assured that he
has true, justifying faith, may confidently say with St Paul, Romans 8. 38. 39.
I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor
any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is
in Christ Jesus our Lord.

CHAP. XVII. Of the signs and marks of true, justifying faith: and first, of
the inward signs thereof.
THe tenth, and last point, in the Treatise of faith, 10 Signs of true faith.
is, touching the signs, and marks of true, justifying faith. How a man may
know whether he has the true faith.

The signs and marks of faith are twofold. Twofold.


The first, are inward. The second, outward.
There are inward signs of faith, whereby a man may know and find in himself,
that he has faith: and there are also outward signs, whereby not only he
himself may be assured, but others also may understand, and perceive, that he
has faith. First, of the inward signs.

The inward signs of true, justifying faith, are diverse: 1 Inward signs, as


The first, is the witness of the Spirit: even the Spirit of God. Of which St
John says, 1. Job. 5. 10.
he that believes on 1 The witness of the Spirit.
the Son of God, has the witness in himself. Now, the Spirit of God is a
true, and infallible witness, a witness that cannot deceive, and the same
Spirit bears witness with our spirit, that we are the sons of God.

Some may here demand, How may I be assured, that

First, the Spirit of God persuades our conscience inwardly,

Secondly, the Spirit of God persuades us of the certainty peace of
conscience, etc. All which, are true effects, and manifest fruits of the
Spirit, and cannot come either from the flesh or the Devil, and therefore the
testimony of the Spirit, is a true, and sure witness, to assure us, that we
have the true faith: and he that believes on the son of God, has this
witness in himself.

The second, is an inward feeling of spiritual grace, 2 A feeling of grace.
a feeling of faith in a man's self. When a man is persuaded of the truth of
the Gospel, and all the promises contained therein; and in particular, is
persuaded for himself, that his sins, of the mercy of God, and through the
merits of Christ, are pardoned, and he received into favor with God: the
inward feeling, and perceiving of this in the Menti nosirae, fides nostra
conspicua, est.
heart, is a sign of faith. This was in David, after that he had confessed his
sins unto God, as he witnesses, saying, Psalm. 32. 5.
I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I said I
will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgauest the iniquity
of my sin.

The third, is a godly desire, and a holy, resolved purpose, to walk in
obedience to Gods commandments; 3 A godly desire and purpose to obey Gods
commandments.
to please God, and to do his will. This was also in David, for he says,
Psalm. 119. 6. 4
I have respect unto all thy Commandments.

The fourth, is devout prayer, calling upon the name of the Lord, with
confidence, that God will hear our prayers, and grant our requests. For faith
if it be in the 4 Devout prayer
heart indeed, will set the heart a-working, to think on God, to pray unto
God, and to call upon his name. For this cause, the Spirit of God is called the
spirit of grace, and supplications; the Lord by the Prophet Zachary says,
Zach. 12. 10.
I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
the spirit of grace, and of supplications. And it is called the spirit of grace
and supplications, because it is of the gracious working of Gods holy spirit,
that sinners are brought to repentance of their sins, that they mourn and
sorrow for their sins, and that they seek unto the Lord, and call unto him for
grace and mercy. This is the same Spirit, which Romans 8 26.
helps our infirmities; as S. Paul speaks, For we know not what we should
pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it self makes intercession for us, with
gronings which cannot be uttered. This is also that which S. Paul has to the
Galatians, Call. 4. 6.
And because ye are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into
your hearts, crying, Abba Father. By all which, it is manifest, that it is a
sure and certain sign of true faith, if the Spirit of God work this grace in
us, to stir up our hearts, by devout prayer and supplication, to seek unto
God, to run unto our Heavenly Father, and to cry Abba, Father. A child in
time of sickness, pain, and grief, or being in any peril and danger,
whither does he run, or to whom does he cry, but to his father? he hopes his
father will help him, and therefore calls and cries to his father, complains
and makes his moan to his father. Like as the Shunamites son, when he was
sore grieved with a pain in his head, came to his father and said, Luke 4. 19.
My head, my head. So, the sons and children of God, in time of their
heaviness of soul, when they are sick with sin, diseased in soul, and
troubled in conscience, with the burden of their sins, or whether they be
in any outward affliction or trouble, whither do they run, but to their
Heavenly Father? and as the Shunamites child said to his father, My head, my
head; so they every one cry, My soul, my soul; My conscience, my conscience:
my soul is in heaviness, my conscience is sore troubled and burdened, with
the heavy weight of my sins. And then in hope of the mercy of God in Jesus
Christ, they humbly confess their sins, they hide not their iniquities, they
earnestly crave mercy, and sue for the pardon of their sins; above all
things, they seek ease to their afflicted soul, and comfort to their
distressed conscience: building upon those gracious word of our Savior Matthew.
11. 28.
Come unto me all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest. And thus to call upon the name of the Lord, is a sign of says.

the Spirit: and that is twofold.

The one, is a striving against sin.
The other, a striving against doubtings.
Touching the first: no man in this life is perfectly 1 A struing against sin.
sanctified; but has need to pray more and more for the Spirit of
sanctification, that he may be wholly sanctified. Hence it is, that though a
natural, and unregenerate man be wholly carnal, yet a regenerate man is not
all spiritual; but partly carnal, and partly spiritual. For although a
Christian, regenerate, and sanctified, has his heart purified by faith; yet
natural corruption is not altogether purged out of the heart: that remains in
us (...).
to exercise us. This, in the children of God now regenerate and sanctified, is
called flesh: and the sanctified part in them, is called spirit. And in the
regenerate, there is a great combat, a spiritual fight, and great striving
between these two, the flesh and the spirit, which shall get the victory. The
manner of which combat and inward fight, S. Paul describes thus: Gal. 5. 17.
The flesh lusts against the spirit, the spirit against the flesh, and these
are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye
would. A Christian regenerate and sanctified, is in the way to Heaven, and the
spirit, that is, the sanctified part draws him on to Godward, and hastens him
forward toward the Kingdom of Heaven: but the flesh, that is, the corruption
of nature, rebels and labors to draw him backwards to the world; and would, if
it were possible, draw him down to hell. Hence it is, that a Christian finds
in himself, pride of heart, lust of the flesh, filthy desires, unclean
thoughts, covetous desires, anger, hatred, envy, malice, grudgings, and desire
of revenge, etc. haling and pulling him one way; and against these, he feels
humility, temperance, love, patience, meekness, and other graces, drawing him
another way. Now, if a man do find grace striving against corruption, good
motions of the good Spirit, fighting against bad motions of the evil Spirit,
and if a man do indeed and in truth, find that he does earnestly strive
against sin, that he labors to mortify his affections, to crucify the
flesh with the affections and lusts, to subdue sin and wickedness, this is a
sign of grace, and a sure mark that faith is in the heart, at least, in some
measure. According to that saying of the Apostle, Verse. 24.
They that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with the affections and
lusts. As Genesis 25. 22, 23.
Rebecca knew her self to be quick with child, by the struggling and
striving of the twins in her womb; so a Christian may know whether he be
quickened by grace, and live by faith in the Son of God, by the inward
conflict and striving between the Flesh and the Spirit.

The second kind of inward conflict between the 2 A striving against
doubtings.
flesh and the spirit, is an inward striving against doubtings, and distrusts
in Gods mercy. It is the Devils policy, either to cause men; whiles they
remain in their natural state, without true faith and repentance, to presume
on Gods mercy; or else having faith and repentance, to set before them their
sins, and to suggest into their hearts, doubtings of the remission of their
sins, doubtings concerning their faith and repentance, and doubtings concerning
their vocation, and sanctification. And thereby, would if it were poss^ble,
extinguish their faith, and bring them to despair of Gods mercy. But against
all these difficulties, true justifying faith, if it be in the heart, will show
it self, though perhaps in these temptations, but weakly, yet truly, to
strive against temptations, and to fight against all these doubtings. It is
true, I confess; the children of God may be troubled with doubtings, but not
overcome of doubtings. David is driven to this expostulation, Psalm. 77. 7, 8.
Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favorable no more? Is his
mercy clean gone for ever? Here are great doubtings in David a servant of the
Lord; but he overcame his doubtings: for neither David, nor any of the children
of God continue still in their doubtings. They are never with Cain and Judas
brought to such desperate doubtings, a^ utterly, and finally to despair of the
mercy of God. They may, for a time, have distrustful thoughts, and doubtful
speeches, but faith in the end gets the upper hand. Winds and floods may beat
upon the house grounded upon the rock, as well as upon the house built upon the
sand, but cannot make it fall. And many Dubitationes fidem in nobis oppugnant,
non tamen expugnant. Polan.
distrustful doubtings may beat against the faith of a Christian, but cannot
beat it down, they may fight against it, but cannot overcome it. Wherefore, to
find in our selves a resisting of such distrustful doubtings, is a sign of
Faith: as appears in that saying of S. Peter, 1 Pet. 5. 8.
Your adversary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walks about, seeking whom he
may devour, whom resist, steadfast in the faith.

By these forenamed signs and marks of Faith, we Examine our selves, whether
we have the true faith.
justifying faith; whether we live by the faith of the Son of God, and whether
Christ dwell in our hearts by faith. This is the Apostles exhortation, 2 Cor.
13. 5.
Examine your selves whether ye be in the faith, prove your own selves: know
ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be
reprobates? Now then let us every one make a search into our hearts, and try
whether we find the good Spirit of God persuading us indeed, that we are
the children of God, and that we have faith: whether we have a feeling of
spiritual grace: whether the Spirit of God has wrought in us a love of God, a
hatred of sin, a resolved purpose to amend our lives: whether we find in our
selves, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and whether we can truly
find that inward conflict between the flesh and the spirit. If these things
be in us, happy are we. But if upon examination had, these things be wanting in
any, such men may speak of faith, but as yet they have it not: they are far
short of true saving faith, and so come short of salvation. Let the search be
made a little more inwardly: A man may know whether he has faith, by the
inward feeling of grace; if faith be in the heart, the Spirit of God will set
it a working, it will not lie asleep, but it will stir up other graces of God
in us; it will make us to love God, and hate sin, more then ever we did
before. It will move us to pray, and call upon the name of the Lord. Wherefore,
if any one do not feel in himself, a gracious working of the good Spirit, if
he find not in himself a far greater love of God, and loathing of sin, if
he have not a more holy purpose to obey God, and to do his will; if he do
not, nor cannot pray, if in his trouble and affliction, outward and inward, he
do not seek unto God, if he do not with the child, run to his Heavenly
Father, and cry, Abba, Father, it is an evident sign, that as yet, Christ does
not dwell in his heart by faith, and that as yet he lives not by the faith of
the Son of God. Let us search yet a little further; the unregenerate man
continues in sin, lives in the manifest transgression of the Commandments of
God, yet presumes he has faith. I hope, says he, I have a good faith: but
how is it, o man, if thou have true faith, that thou still live in sin?
certain it is, if faith were in thy heart, it would cause a reformation of
life, or at least, a holy purpose of amendment of life. And so in time, and by
degrees, thy heart would be renewed, and thy life reformed.

Indeed, I know I ought to reform my ways, and amend my life, and I would
feign amend, but it is the flesh that draws me to evil. But I demand of
thee, o man that complainest of the flesh, where is the inward conflict
between the flesh and the spirit? and where is thy striving against thy
corruptions? what, do evil thoughts arise in thy heart, and thou make no
resistance? does thy heart swell with pride? do filthy lusts arise in thy
heart? does thy heart abound with covetous desire? and ouerflow with the gall
of bitterness, anger, hatred, envy, malice, and desire of revenge? and do
thou not strive against these corruptions, but give way unto them,
entertaining them, and embracing them? certainly, here is no good sign of
grace, nor of true faith. For where true faith is, there will be a resisting of
sin, and a striving against corruptions. Wherefore, if we would have a good
testimony in our selves, of the assurance of true faith, then we must be
careful to resist sin, and to strive against our corruptions: and although
the combat will be great, to master our sins, and to get dominion over our
corruptions, yet by little and little, we shall overcome, and in the end, get
the victory. According to that faying of S. John, 1 Ioh. 5. 4.
This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the outward signs of true justifying Faith; and first, of
Patience in suffering afflictions.
FAith, as it may be discerned by inward, so also by 2 Outward signs.
outward signs. And the outward signs of true justifying faith, are these.

The first, is Patience in suffering: of which, 1 Patience.
S. Paul speaks thus to the Philippians, Phil. 1 29.
For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him,
but also to suffer for his sake. As if he should have said; now since that you
believe, there arise troubles, and persecutions; adversaries rise up against
you, and trouble you; but be not ye afraid of these things, be not terrified
therewith, for seeing God has given you grace to believe in his Son Jesus
Christ, you must be content also to suffer for his sake: and the same God that
gave you faith to believe in Christ, will also give you patience to suffer for
Christ's sake: and this shall be a testimony and witness to all men, of the
truth of your faith in Christ, if you have patience to suffer for Christ's
sake. So then, to Pati pro Chris^^, manif^st^ssimum est argumentum fides in
Christum. Zanch. in Philip. Twofold.
suffer for Christ's sake is a manifest testimony, and good sign of faith in
Christ. For no man can truly suffer for Christ, except it be first given him to
believe in Christ.

Of patience in suffering, I will entreat,

First, generally, of suffering all manner of afflictions, inward and outward,
as they come from God.

Secondly, particularly, of suffering injuries and wrongs from men.

First, of suffering afflictions in general: and therein 1 In suffering
afflictions. And therein, two things.
I will show,

First, wherein the sufferings of a Christian consist, and what things are
required thereunto, that his sufferings may be acceptable, and well pleasing
unto God.

Secondly, I will use motives to persuade unto patient suffering.

For the first: That the sufferings of a Christian may 1 How our sufferings may

please God, three things are required thereunto.

The first, is, to suffer for the name of Christ: The second, is, to suffer for
any righteous cause, The third, is, to suffer patiently.
Touching the first: Every suffering is not commendable before men, much less
acceptable before God: but that suffering is commendable, and acceptable before
God, which is

First, for Christ's sake, and the Gospels sake. When a 1 To suffer for. the
name of Christ.
Christian suffers tribulation and persecution for the name of Christ. Of this,
our Savior says, Math. 5. 11.
blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say
all manner of evil against you, falsely for my sake. To which agrees the
saying of S. Peter. 1. Pet. 4. 14.
if ye be reproched for the name of Christ, happy are ye: this was the honor
and glory of those Christians, who have been persecuted, tormented, and
suffered death for Christ's sake. For they rather yielded to suffer death, then
to deny Christ. This is the Crown of Martyrdom, for it was not their bare
Non paena, sed causa verum facit Martyrem. Cypr.
suffering that made them Martyrs, but their cause. Because they suffered for
the name of Christ. Wherefore, Heretics, though they suffer never so many,
and sore torments, yet they are not Martyrs, neither are their sufferings
acceptable to God: because they suffer not for Christ's sake: nor for the
truth, but against the truth.

Secondly, sufferings are acceptable to God, when they 2 To suffer for
well-doing.
are for well-doing: and when we are afflicted, perfecuted, and troubled
wrongfully. As S. Peter says, 1. Pet. 2. 19.
This is thanke-worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief,
suffering wrongfully. Again, he says, 1. Pet. 3. 17.
it is better if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, then for
evil doing. And again, 1. Pet. 4. 15. 16
let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil doer, or
as a busibodie in other men's matters, yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let
him not be ashamed.

The third thing, which makes our sufferings acceptable to God, is to suffer
patiently. Whether it be for 3 To suffer patiently.
Christ's sake, or whether it be in any other righteous cause, it is the part
of a Christian, not only to suffer, but to suffer patiently. For this is the
difference between the wicked and the godly, concerning their sufferings: both
may suffer afflictions, as sickness, infirmity, and pain of body, poverty,
and such like, but not both alike: both may suffer the same things, but not
with the same mind. The wicked suffer afflictions of necessity, because they
cannot help themselves, and know not how to be ridd of their pain, and
troubles; their suffering is a constrained suffering, and their patience,
patience perforce. But the godly suffer afflictions patiently: they endure all
afflictions, which the Lord lays upon them, with a willing mind, a meek
heart, and quiet patience. Such ought our sufferings to be, that they may
please God.

In the second place, I am to use motives, to persuade 3 Motives to persuade to
patience. Taken from
to Patience in suffering afflictions. Which I take,

First, from the Scriptures. Secondly, from the necessity of afflictions.
Thirdly, fromt the benefit thereof.
For the first: The Scripture persuades to patience in 1 The Scriptures. And
suffering afflictions, both by testimonies and examples. First, by
testimonies: Solamon gives this wise counsel, Pro. 3. 11.
my son, despise not the chastning of the Lord, Our Savior 1 Testimonies.
Christ says, Luke 9. 23.
if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross
daily, and follow me. Saint James is very earnest in exhorting to Patience,
Iam. 5. 8. 9.
be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord: behold, the
husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience
for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient.

Examples also we have hereof in the Scriptures: Job is a Mirror of patience:
for when he had lost all his goods 2 Examples.
and substance, his sheep, his oxen, his camells and asses, yea, when his
children were slain; his patience was such, that he blessed God. For he Job 1.
20. 21.
fell down upon the ground and worshipped, and said, naked came I out of my
mothers womb, and naked shall I return thither: The Lord gave, and the Lord
has taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord. And when his wife, who should
have been a helper, and a comfort unto him, came unto him vexing his soul,
bidding him Job 2. 9. 10.
Curse God, and die. His answer was, What? shall we receive good at the hand
of God, and shall we not receive evil? Shall we receive all blessings, and no
crosses? All prosperity, and no adversity? All health, and no sickness?
Wherefore S. James, exhorting to patience, sets before our eyes the example of
Job for imitation, Iam. 5. 10.
Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord: that
the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. S. Paul is also an example of
suffering: when the Christian brethren heard from the mouth of Aga^us, a
Prophet, of the sufferings of Paul, which he was to suffer at Jerusalem, they
labored to dissuade him from going up to Jerusalem, but Paul answered, Act.
21. 13.
What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart. For I am ready not to be
bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus. And
to the Corinthians, he shows his great patience in suffering many afflictions
in this present world. For he says, 1. Cor. 4. 11. 12. 13.
even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are
buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place, and labor, working with our
own hands: being reviled, we bless: being persecuted, we suffer it: being
defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the
offscouring of all things unto this day. But no example is like that of our
Savior Christ: for he, as the Prophet Esaias says, Isa. 53. 7.
is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearer is
dumb, so he opens not his mouth. And S. Peter says, 1. Pet. 2. 21. 22. 23.
Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
steps, who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth. Who when he was
reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not, but commitied
himself to him that judges righteously. Such was the patience of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ.

These are examples written for our instruction, to teach us patience: Whereunto
we may add the worthy examples of the servants of the Lord, those faithful
ones, mentione by the Apostle to the Hebrews, who through faith endured great
trials, some were Heb. 11. 35. 36. 37. 38.
tortured, others had trial of cruel mockings, and scourgings, yea moreover
of bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawen asunder, were
tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepe-skinnss, and
goat-skinnes, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not
worthy: they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens, and in caves
of the earth. And they that suffered such things, were no evil doers, they
were the servants of the Lord Jesus, they believed in Jesus, and they suffered
such things for the name of Jesus; as a testimony of their faith in Jesus.
Thus first the Scripture exhorts us to patience in suffering.

The second motive, to persuade us to patience in suffering 2 The necessity of
afflictions.
afflictions, I take from the necessity of afflictions.

Afflictions are very necessary for Christians, and For afflictions are
therefore are to be endured with patience: for

First, they are trials of our faith and patience. God 1 Trials of our faith
and patience.
tries his children with many afflictions, and hard trials, trying thereby the
constancy of their faith and patience. So he tried Abraham's faith, when he
commanded him to offer his Genesis 22. 1. 2.
son, his only son Izaak. And S. James says, Iam. 1. 3.
the trial of your faith works patience. Afflictions are as necessary for a
Christian, as the furnace is for gold: of which Solamon has a Proverb, Pro.
17. 3.
the fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the Lord tries
the hearts. As the Gold smiths fire tries which is good gold, separating the
gold from the dross; so the fire of affliction tries who is a good christian,
and who is not; discerns who has faith, and patience, and who has not. The
Psalmist says, Psalm. 66. 10. 11.
Thou, O God, have proved us: thou have tried us, as silver is tried. And it
follows, thou layedst affliction upon our loins. The later words expound the
former; the Lord tries and proves us, by laying affliction upon us. How can
a man's patience be seen but in time of affliction? he is not the patient man,
who can only speak of patience, and commend patience for a virtue, and
perhaps exhort others to patience; but when affliction is upon a man's self,
when the burden of affliction lies heavy upon his own shoulders, and
presses him down, if he can then struggle against afflictions, if he can show
the strength of hi^ faith, and patience to bear the afflictions that lie upon
himself, patiently; and if he can now show patience himself, when God tries
his patience, this is patience indeed. Thus afflictions are necessary, for
the trial of our faith, and patience.

Secondly, afflictions are necessary to cleanse and purify 2 Means to cleanse
our hearts from sin.
our hearts; to purge our hearts of inward corruptions, and to scour out the
filthiness of sin, that sticks in the heart. For this cause, afflictions
are compared to fire, that purges and purifieth: the Lord showed Ezekiel the
great filthiness, and uncleanness of the Inhabitants of Jerusalem, by a
boiling pot, whose scum was in it. Ezekiel. 24 3, 4, 5, 6.
Woe to the bloody City, to the Pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not
gone out of it. By which, was signified, that there was much filthiness
amongst the people, which must be consumed by the fire of affliction and
tribulation. Wherefore Job, who was exceedingly afflicted, and as it were, cast
into the very fire of affliction, says, Job 23. 10.
When he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold. Afflictions are as
necessary for the soul, as physic is for the body. If the body be
ouerpressed with gross and ^u^ll humors, its necessary, that it be purged by
phy^icke; so the sou^e, that is oppressed with the euil^ humo^^s of sin, with
the filthiness and uncleanness of v^c^ and iniquity, must be purged by
afflictions, to recover the health of the soul: Tunc anima purgatur, cum
propter Deum tribulatur. Chrysostom. ad pop. Antioc^. Hom. 66.
The soul is then purged, when it is troubled by afflictions, and suffers for
God. The air, if it were not cleansed with winds, would prove infectious;
the body of man, if it want exercise, breeds ill humors; and standing waters
gathers filth: so it i^ with the soul: if some winds of afflictions do not
blow upon us, if we be not exercised with some cross, and be not troubled with
some sort of tribulations, we shall abound with the ill humors of vice and
iniquity, and our hearts will be a very puddle of filthiness and
uncleanness. Yea, without afflictions, we shall be even like Moab, of whom it
is said, Ier 48. 11.
Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and
has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into
captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his sent is not changed.

Thirdly, afflictions are necessary; for except we suffer 3 Without suffering
afflictions we cannot come to Heaven.
for Christ, we cannot reign with Christ. We are spiritual soldiers of Jesus
Christ, now, a man is 2 Timothy 2. 5.
not crowned, except he strive lawfully. If we would overcome, we must strive;
if we would be crowned in Heaven, we must endure the hardness of
afflictions on earth; and if we would wear the crown of glory, we must be
content to carry the cross on our shoulders, and to go after Christ, bearing
his reproach. S. Paul says, Romans 8 17.
And if (we be children, then heirs, heirs of God, and ioynt-heires with
Christ: if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified
together. No glory in heaven, without some sufferings on earth. But, 2 Timothy 2.
12.
if we suffer, we shall also reign with him. Suffering for Christ, goes
before reigning with Christ. The way to heaven, is by afflictions and
tribulations, Acts 14. 22.
We must, through much tribulation, enter into the Kingdom of God. If we will
come to heaven, we must go as the Israelites went, Psalm. 66. 12.
through fire, and through water: that is, through hard and great afflictions:
the Israelites are promised the land of Canaan, but first, they endure much
hardness in Egypt; they must pass through the red sea, go through a
wilderness, fight many battles, and overcome many enemies, before they enjoy
the promised land: Heaven is our promised land: but before we can come thither,
we must endure much trouble in the world; pass through a sea of troubles, go
through a wilderness of thorny tribulations, fight many battles against our
spiritual enemies, the flesh, the world, and the Devil; and by Faith, get the
victory, and overcome, before we can sit with Christ in his Throne. As Christ
also says, Reu. 3. 21.
To him that overcomes, will I grant, to sit with me in my Throne, even as I
also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his Throne.

Fourthly, if we have not afflictions, we are not the 4 Without afflictions, we
are no sons of God.
true sons of God: so says the Apostle, Heb. 12. 8.
But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye
bastards and not sons. Thus afflictions are necessary.

The Third motive, to persuade us to suffer afflictions patiently, I take from
the benefit of afflictions. what 3 The benefit of afflictions. For afflications
are
is there benefit of afflictions? do afflictions profit a man? and is there
any good in afflictions? yea, afflictions as they are necessary; so are they
also good and profitable; and that diverse ways.

First, afflictions serve greatly for the humbling of a sinner: afflictions
cause a sinner to search into his own 1 A means to humble us.
heart, to find out his own ways, they make a man know himself, know his
own ways, they make a man know himself, know his own sins and misery, and
to see in what danger his soul stands, by reason of his sinful life: and so
at last, through afflictions, he is humbled before God. A sinner going on in
his sins, is presumptuous, high minded, stubborn, and rebellious against
God: Like Ephraim, who before the Lord chastised him, was as a Ier. 31. 18.
Bullock unaccustomed to the yoke. But chastisements, and afflictions do bring
down a sinner, bring his neck under the yoke, and humble him before the Lord;
as Israel being in great affliction and misery, is humbled, and lamenteth
thus, Lam. 3. 19. 20.
Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall, my soul
has them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. Manass^h king of Judah, a
great sinner, never truly humbled himself, til the Lord laid great affliction
upon him: 2 Chr. 33. 12.
and when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled
himself greatly before the God of his fathers,

Secondly, afflictions are a means to stir up many 2 A means to stir up
the graces of God in us.
graces of God in us, and to set them a working: as faith, hope, charity,
humility, patience, etc. as S. Paul. says, Tribulation works patience, and
patience experience, and experience hope, and hope makes not ashamed. Frank
incense q Romans 5 3. 4. 5.
being cast into the fire, makes a more excellent perfume; and spices being
beaten, smell much sweeter: so a Christian being cast into the fire of
affliction, tried with the fiery trial, makes a more sweet perfume in the
nosthrills of almighty God, and being beaten with tribulations, smells far
sweeter, by the graces which now appear in him: for now, are manifested his
faith, hope, charity, humility, patience etc. and now he sends up the sweet
incense of prayer.

Thirdly, afflictions are an effectual means to bring 3 A means to bring us
nearer unto God:
us nearer unto God. By our sins, we go astray from God, and wander too and
fro in our own ways, and the further that we go on in our sins, and the
longer that we continue therein, the further off are we from God: now,
afflictions are a means to cause us to turn from our evil way, and to
return unto God. H^s. 5. 15.
In their affliction they will seek me early says the Lord of the people of
Israel, David says of himself, Psalm. 119. 67.
before I was afflicted, I went astray, but now have I kept thy word* and
again he says, V^^s. 71.
it is good for me, that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy
statutes. of the Israelites its said, Psalm. 78. 34,
when he stew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and inquiredearly
after God.

Fourthly, afflictions are a sign of Gods love and favor 4 A sign of Gods
love.
unto us: so says the Apostle, H^b, 12. 67.
Whom the Lord loves he chasteneth, and scourges every son whom he
receives. if ye endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons: for
what son is he whom the Father chasteneth not? yea, Christ Jesus the son of
God, though he was Sine peccat^, non tamen sine flagello.
without sin, yet was he not without the scourge of affliction. Benjamin, was
best beloved of Joseph, and the Genesis 44 12.
cup was found in his sack. Whom God loves above many others, upon them will
he lay afflictions, but all for their good, because he loves them.

Now, considering, that the Scripture requires patient Patiently to endure
afflictions.
who have testified their faith by their sufferings; and seeing the necessity
and benefit of suffering is so great; from hence, we are to learn, willingly
to submit our selves unto God who afflicts us; cheerfully to put under our
shoulders, to under go the yoke of Christ, and patiently to carry his cross.
A Christian having embraced the Gospel of Christ, having apprehended Christ by
faith, and taken upon him the name and profession of Christ, must not think to
pass to heaven with ease; he must look for some afflictions, inward, or
outward, less or more. Luke 9. 23.
If any man will come after me, says Christ, Let him deny himself and take up
his cross daily and follow me. Afflictions, and tribulations are the lot and
portion of the righteous: wherefore our Savior says, Ioh. 16. 33.
in the world ye shall have tribulation. And it is a mark of wicked and
ungodly men, to be without tribulations and afflictions; Psalm. 73. 5.
they are not in trouble as other men, says the Psalmist; neither are they
plagued like other men. But they are as oxen fatted for the day of slaughter:
for as oxen appointed for the slaughter, feed in green pastures, and are
fatted in the stalls; whereas the ox that treads out the corn, feeds more
hardly, and is used to the yoke: so the wicked and ungodly for the most part,
take their pleasures, live at ease, and spend their days in prosperity and
wordly delights, but they are set in Ver. 18. 19.
slippery places. God casts them down into destruction, and they are brought
into desolation as in a moment. But the righteous, though they have
tribulation, and endure affliction in this life, yet there end shall be peace
and quietness. Isa. 57. 2.
He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, as says the Prophet
Esaias: and after this life, Reu. 21. 4.
There shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there
be any more pain.

Further, seeing that so great patience is required in suffering, Against
impatience. by
for every Christian; the consideration hereof, serves to reprove all
impatience about suffering afflictions. and men may offend diverse ways,
through impatience, as.

First, by murmuring against God: when God sends 1 Murmuring against God.
afflictions upon people, and they grudge within themselves, repine and fret,
because the hand of God is upon them afflicting them: this was the sin of the
Israelites, going out of Egypt. When they came to the wilderness and found no
bread, they Exodus 16. 2.
murmured against Moses and Aaron. and when they wanted water, they murmured
Exodus 17. 3.
again. Such murmurers are likened to swine, which make a great noise, and
grudge if they be not satisfied.

Secondly, when men will not wait Gods leisure, nor 2 Limiting God.
stay his good time: but will appoint themselves a time, and limit God: this
was likewise the sin of Israel, of whom its said in the Psalms, Psalm. 78.
41.
The turned back, and tempted God: and limited the holy one of Israel. This
was the sin of those Iud^th. 7.
Bethulians, who, when their city was besieged, would not wait the time of
the Lords deliverance, but set a certain time, that if the Lord did not send
them help within the space of sieve days, then they would deliver up the City
to the enemy. But to keep us from this kind of impatience, we ought rather to
Psalm. 130. 5. 6. 7.
Wait for the Lord, and to hope in him, for with the Lord there is mercy, and
with him is plentuous redemtion, as says the Psalmist.

Thirdly cby fainting under the cross, being wearied 3 Fainting under the
cross.
with the burden of afflictions; hence it is, that many in time of
tribulation, cry out of the greatness of their cross, and grieuosnesse of
their pain; n^uer was any so crossed, never was any so much troubled, never
had any such pain, and such like words of impatience: and diverse hereupon out
of coffeehouse, and through impatience, wish themselves out of the world,
that they might be rid of their trouble, and eased of their pain. But I wish
and desire, that such people would first examine themselves, and consider well
aforehand, whether they be ready and well-prepared for death, before they so
much desire the coming of death: lest death come unlooked for, and take them
unawares.

And I demand of all such as are any way impatient, either by murmuring against
God, or are not content to wait the Lords leisure, or that faint under their
afflictions and crosses; where is your patience? and where is your faith?
certain it is, if faith were in the the heart, it would help to strengthen our
hearts, that we should not faint in tribulation: and the trial of our faith
would work patience, and our patience in suffering, would be a testimony and a
witness of our faith; that as it is given unto us in the behalf of Christ, to
believe in him, so also to suffer for his sake.

general. There is also Patience to be showed, in suffering wrongs and
injuries from men. In handling whereof, I will show,

First, what the wrongs and injuries are, which a Christian may, or can suffer
from men: that so he may see how far his patience is to extend, and stretch
it self.

Secondly, I will make it manifest, that a Christian is to suffer wrongs and
injuries from men.

For the first: All wrongs and injuries that one man 1 The sorts and kinds of

may or can do to another, may be reduced to these three heads.

They are either touching,

admonition: Zach. 8. 17.
Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts, against his neighbor.

For, both by word and deed, a man may do wrong to his neighbor, three ways;
In regard of

First, a man may do wrong to his neighbors body: 1 To a man's body. And that,
and that,

Secondly, by deed; as smiting his neighbor, hurting and wounding his body,
or shedding his blood: also 2 By deed.
by abusing the body of any, through fornication, or any manner of uncleanness.

Secondly, wrongs and injuries may be done to a 2 To a man's goods. And that,
man, concerning his goods:

dispraising his corn, or cattle, or wares, or any thing that his neighbor
has; with a purpose 1 By word.
to bring others in dislike with his neighbors goods, and so to hinder him in
the sale of them.

Secondly, by deed; when any one offers any personal 2 By deed.

any one does steal and purloyne any man's goods, or violently take them from
him: when any one goes about to hurt and hinder another of his right, and when
one does trespass against his neighbor, and either spoil or hurt his
neighbors corn or cattle, or any thing that is his.

Thirdly, men may do wrong to others, in regard of 3 To a man's good name. And

manifest,

First, by testimonies of Scripture. Secondly, by example in Scripture.
For the first. The Scripture is plentiful in precepts 1 Testimonies of
Scripture.
and exhortations to patience, in suffering wrongs. Our Savior Christ says,
Matthew. 5. 44.
Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,
and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you. Here is great
patience required; for if any one have an enemy that railes on him, and reuiles
him, that speaks evil against him, yea, curses him, he is commanded to
bless: if our enemy hate us, we are to wish well unto him, yea, to do him
good; and if our enemy should trouble us, and persecute us, and despitefully
use us, yet we are to pray for our enemy, as Christ prayed for his Crucifiers,
Luk 23. 34.
Father, forgive them. And as Steven prayed for his Persecutors, Acts 7. 60.
Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. S. Paul rebuking the Corinthians,
for their manner of going to law, says, 1 Cor. 67.
Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer your selves
to be defrauded? add heereunto, his exhortation to the Romans, Romans 12. 18.
If it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men. It is
hard for a man to live peaceably with all men; yet it is not impossible; and
therefore the Apostle would have every one to labor, by all means, as much as
lies in him, to preserve peace and concord with all men, which a man cannot
possibly do, except he be content to suffer much, and to put up many wrongs
and injuries, whether they concern his body, goods, or good name.

And to persuade us yet more to patient suffering of 2 Examples of suffering
wrong.
wrongs, we are not destitute of examples of rare patience in suffering
wrongs, and putting up injuries, both in body, goods, and good name.

Of patient suffering wrongs and injuries in body, 1 In body.
Paul is our example; who to the Corinthians says, that he was in 2 Cor. 11
23, 24, 25.
stripes above measure, in prison more frequent: in deaths ^ft. Of the Jews,
says he, five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten
with rods, once was I stoned. These were Paul's sufferings from the hands of
men, concerning his body; in all which, he labored to 2 Cor. 6. 4, 5.
approve himself as the Minister of God, in much patience.

Of patience in suffering wrongs in goods, Job is an 2 In goods.
example; who was robbed of his Oxen and Asses, by the Job 1. 14, 15.
Sabeans: and of his Camels, by the Verse. 17.
Caldeans: these Sabeans and Caldeans made out their bands, and came with force
against Jobs servants, they cruelly slew his servants, and violently took away
his goods and substance, his Oxen, his Asses, and his Camels: all which wrongs
and injuries from the hands of cruel men, Job took patiently, and said, Verse.
21.
The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord.

And, for patient suffering of wrongs and injuries, 3 In good name.
concerning a man's good name, David is our example: for he says, Psalm. 69. 12,
12.
They that sit in the gate, speak against me; and I was the song of the
Drunkards. But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, o Lord. David confesses,
that wicked men, sons of Belial, profane people, very Drunkards, as they
sat over their pots, did abuse him in words, spoke evil of him behind his
back, and made songs of him. And yet such was David's patience, that he
suffered these things, he endured all, and gave himself to prayer. But David's
patience is most apparent, in forbearing the railing words of Shimei; who in
David's hearing, railed upon him, saying, 2 Samuel 16. 7.
Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial: and when Abishai,
one of David's Nobles, would have gone out in all haste, and stricken off the
head of Shimei, for railing on the King, and cursing him, David's answer was,
Verse. 11, 12.
Let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord has bidden him. It may be,
that the Lord will look on mine affliction, and that the Lord will requite
good for his cursing this day. Such was David's patience.

But our Savior Christ is an example to us of suffering 4 In body, goods, and
good name.
wrongs and injuries, both in his body, goods, and good name. Of all which
wrongs, the Matthew. 27. Luke 23. John 19.
Evangelists make mention; for touching his body: the Jews despitefully used
him, they scourged him, they platted a crown of thorns, and put it upon his
head, they spate upon him, they smote him on the head, and lastly, they
crucified him; they nailed his hands and his feet, and pierced his side.

Concerning his goods: they first stripped him of his raiment, and the
soldiers parted his garments among them, and upon his vesture did they cast
lots. And he also suffered in his good name: for the Jews oftimes reviled him,
and railed upon him, they say of him, Matt. 11. 19.
Behold, a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of Publicanes and
sinners. They say unto him, Ioh. 8. 48.
Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritane, and have a Devil. They accuse
him before Pilate, to be a Luke 23. 2.
fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar.
Again, at his death, they reviled him, saying, Matthew. 27. 40.
Thou that destroyest the Temple, and buildest it in three days, save thy
self: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the Cross. Again, they
mocked him, saying, Verse. 42.
He saved others, himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let
him now come down from the Cross, and we will believe him. All these wrongs
and injuries, in body, goods, and good name, Christ suffered, and that
patiently, as witnesses S. Peter, who speaking of Christ's patience in
suffering, says, 1 Pet. 2. 23.
When he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened
not, but committed himself to him that judges righteously.

Here, a question arises concerning patience in suffering

For answer hereunto; we are to consider, that wrongs

And of wrongs, there are three degrees. Three degrees of wrongs.


First, some, are small offenses, little wrongs, and injuries: as disgraceful,
and disdainful speeches, which 1 Small offenses.
indeed, may offend, and displease the party against whom they are spoken, but
yet they are not so great, as to bring any hurt or hindrance to a man, either
in his body, goods, or good name. As when the Jews spoke disdainfully of
Christ, Mat. 13. 55.
is not this the Carpenters son? Who is this that is come amongst us? What is
he that takes so much upon him? We know whence he is, his father is but a
Carpenter.

Secondly, there are greater wrongs and injuries, 2 Greater wrongs.
which may not only displease and grieve the party, against whom the wrongs
are done, but also bring some hurt, either to his body, goods or good name.
But yet the wrongs are not very great, not so great, but that they may be
endured.

Thirdly, there are wrongs and injuries which are very manifest, and great
wrongs, such as touch a man very 3 Very great and intolerable wrongs.
nearly, either in his person; when, it may be, his l^fe is in danger, through
the malice of the adversary: or when a man suffers, or is in danger to suffer
great hurt, loss, and damage in his goods, and substance; yea, it may be, in
his whole estate: or when a man's good name is so called in question, as that an
infamy, and perpetual reproach may stick unto him, if he labor not to clear
his credit and estimation. These are the degrees of wrongs and injuries. Now in
all these, the patience of a Christian is to show it self, both in forbearing,
and forgiving: which S. Paul teaches us; Col s. 3. 13.
forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel
against any. From whence I gather, that when any are at st^ife and variance,
and have any quarrel one against another, the party that has the wrong done
unto him, is to show his patience two manner of ways:

First, in forbearing: Patience twofold.
Secondly, in forgiving.
First, in forbearing: And the forbearance of a Christian 1 In forbearing.
stands in diverse things: In forbearing,

First, all rash and hasty anger, all hatred to the party; 1 Rash anger,
hatred, malice, etc.
in no case, to hate the person of his enemy: likewise, forbearing all malice,
grudging, and all desire of reuerge.

Secondly, all reuiling and reproachful speeches; to 2 Reproachful speeches.
the forbearance of both which, S. Paul exhorts, saying, Ephe. 4. 31.
let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking be
put away from you, with all malice. And S. Peter exhorts us, 1. Pet. 3. 9.
not to render evil for evil, or railing for railing. And for this patient
forbearing, we have the example of Christ, who, as S. Peter says, 1. Pet. 2.
23.
When he was reviled, reviled not again.

Thirdly, all private revenge: a Christian may not require 3 Private revenge.
evil for evil: to this present forbearing of revenge, S. Paul exhorts, 1.
These. 5. 15.
see that none render evil for evil unto any man. And thus commands our
Savior, Mat. ^. 39.
resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to
him the other also. By which not resisting of evil, and turning the other
cheek to him that smites us, is meant, that a Christian is to show patience
in suffering wrong, to take wrong upon wrong, rather then once to revenge his
own wrong: not to give one evil word for another, nor one blow for another,
and as S. Paul says, Romans 12. 19. 21.
not to revenge our selves. But rather to give place unto wrath: and not to be
overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good.

These three sorts of forbearance, are to be showed in all manner of wrongs
whatsoever.

Fourthly, besides all this, a Christian is in lesser 4. Suing at law about
lesser wrongs.
wrongs, and injuries, to forbear suing at law: not seeking to right himself
by law, except it be in the greatest wrongs, and in the highest degree of
injuries. It was the Corinthians fault, upon light occasions, and for small
wrongs, and injuries, to go to law one with another: whom the Apostle
reproues, saying, 1 Cor. 6. 7.
There is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another:
why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer your selves to
be defrauded? And if the wrongs and injuries, which are offered to any one, be
of a high nature, in the highest degree of wrongs, so that the wrongs and
injuries do very greatly concern a man, and nearly touch him in his body,
goods, or good name; if they be such great wrongs, and injuries, as do
endanger his life, his estate, or his estimation and credit, and that of
necessity, Rules to be observed in suing at law.
he be constrained to defend himself against his adversary by course of law;
herein a Christian is to show his patience, in forbearing.

First, going to law in the first place: for it behooues a 1 Not to go to law
in the first place.
Christian, first to labor for peace, and to seek by all means, if it be
possible, to have satisfaction for wrong done, without law: and to use the
benefit of law only for necessity, as the last remedy: even as a wounded
man is constrained at the last, when there is no remedy, to suffer a member of
his body to be cut off.

This going to law in the first place, was a fault in the Corinthians, who were
reproved for it by S. Paul, 1. Cor. 6. 7.
there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another:
where, they are reproved not only for going to law upon light occasions, and
for small wrongs, but likewise for going to law, Reprehendit h^c ipsum, quod
tam temere l^tigent. Pis^at. in 1. Cor. 6.
rashly, and in the first place.

Secondly, all hatred of a man's adversary, with whom he is at controversy:
for a Christian ought to love his Not to hate the person of our enemy.
enemy, though it be in the heat of suites. Mat. 5. 44.
Love your enemies says our Savior, and pray for them which despightfully use
you, and persecute you.

Thirdly, all rigor and extremity of Law: a warning 3 Not to use the rigor
and extremity of law.
whereof we have in that unmerciful man, who, having found favor, and
obtained mercy at his Lords hands, for the pardoning and forgiving of a great
debt, the sum of Mat. 18. 24. etc.
ten thousand talents, which he was never able to pay; afterward meeting with
one of his fellow-seruants, which ought him but an hundred pence, dealt
cruelly, and unmercifully with him, laid hands on him, and took him by the
throat, saying, pay me that thou owe. And when his fellow-seruant fell down
at his feet, and besought him, saying, have patience with me, and I will pay
thee all. He would not; but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay
the debt. This was an unmerciful and cruel man, he used all rigor, and
extremity of law against his fellow, he would either have his debt paid, or
his body to prison, though the debt was but small; and if he could not have
his money, he would have his bones. But for this his hard and cruel dealing,
he is greatly dis-liked of his fellow servants, and judged by his Lord to be a
wicked servant: and worthy to be delivered to the tormentors, till he should
pay all his own debt. This, of forbearing wrongs.

Secondly, a Christian is to show his patience in forgiving 2 In forgiving.
wrongs, and injuries: wherein he is to consider,

First the wrong doer. Secondly, the wrong done.
First, for the wrong doer; a Christian ought always 1 The party that has
done wrong.
to be so patient, as to forgive the party that has done him wrong: so our
Savior teaches us, by precept, Luke 6. 37.
forgive, and you shall be forgiven. And by example; for, he himself prayed
for his enemies, Luke 23. 34.
father forgive them. Yea, we are bound not only to forgive our enemies, but
freely to forgive them, even from the heart. For says our Savior, Mat. 1^. 35.
so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts
for give not every one his brother their trespasses.

Secondly, for the wrong done, we are to observe these 2 Concerning the wrong
done.
rules:

First, if the wrong be of the least sort of wrongs, and injuries, then it is a
man's wisdom, and discretion to pass by it; as Solamon counsels, Pro. 19.
11.
the discretion of a 1 To pass by small offenses.
man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.

Secondly, if the wrong and injury be somewhat greater, 2 In greater wrongs,
to clear our own innocence: and then to put up the wrong.
drawing with it some little offense to a man's body, goods, or good name, but
be not of the highest degree of wrongs; a man in such a case, ought first to
labor to clear his own innocence and when he has as much as he can cleared
himself, then, he is to sit down with the wrong, and patiently to put it up:
an example hereof we have in our Savior Christ: the Jews said unto Christ,
Ioh. 8. 48. 49.
Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritane, and have a Devil? Jesus answered
I have not a Devil: but I honor my father, and ye do dishonor me. Here, the
Jews speak disgracefully, and disdainfully of Christ, thou art a Samaritane:
and they rail on him, thou have a Devil: now Christ our Savior being thus
wronged by the wicked tongues of the people, how does he behave himself
toward them? Does he rail on them, as they did on him? No. Does he seek any
means to be avenged on them for the ^^ong done? No. But what did he? The first
word of disgrace, thou art a Samaritane, as being of the least sort of wrongs,
he passed over, said nothing of it; but to the other, thou have a Devil, he
answered for himself, I have not a Devil: that which you speak against me,
is untrue: I have not a Devil: for I honor my father, and you do dishonor
me. He clears himself of the false accusation; and puts up the wrong,
committing himself to God, that judges righteously. This is the behavior of
a Christian concerning lesser wrongs, and injuries.

Thirdly, for wrongs and injuries of the greatest sort, 3 Concerning the
greatest wrongs, and injuries, a man may lawfully use the benefit of law, so
that it be done ma lawful manner.
and highest nature, such wrongs as do nearly concern a man's person, touch
his life, concern his estate, and greatly tend to the utter defaming of him; a
Christian is not bound ^ightly to pass over such wrongs, but may lawfully
defend, and seek to right himself, by lawful means, as before a Magistrate;
so that he proceed in a lawful manner, in his course of law, observing those
rules formerly prescribed. That the Magistrate is the ordinance of God, and
therefore may lawfully be sought unto, S. Paul proves both by word, and
practice: for he says of the Magistrate, that Romans 13. 2. 4.
he is the Minister of God to thee for good: and he is the Minister of God, a
revenger, to execute wrath upon him that does evil. And Paul himself, when
the Jews laid many, and grievous complaints against him, which they could not
prove, Act. 25. 10. 11
appealed to the judgment seat of Rome, there to be judged before Caesar. Thus
I have showed, that we are patiently to suffer wrongs and injuries: and how our
patience is to show it self, when wrongs and injuries are offered us, and that
in all the degrees of wrongs.

Which serves to reprove diverse sorts of people:

First, those who will forbear very little, or no wrong 1 Against private

nor suffer any injury; but are ready to revenge every wrong, to render evil
for evil, like for like, one evil word for another, and one evil deed for
another. Contrary to the rule of the Apostle, 1. These. 5 15.
see that none render evil for evil to any man. This revenging of a man's own
cause, rendering evil for evil, is brutish and beast-like, for so do beasts
gore one another: and so do dogs grinne one at another, bark at, and bite
one another. Reasons to dissuade from revenge.


But thou that wilst needs be avenged on thy adversary, consider with thy
self O man, what thou do; For first, by revenging thine own quarrel, thou
do 1 Revenge more enrageth the adversary.
more enrage thine enemy, more stir him up to anger, and wrath, and
bitterness against thee.

Secondly, in revenging thine own cause, thou vsurpest He that reuengeth his
own cause, usurps Gods office.
Gods authority, thou take upon thy self Gods office; for it is Gods office
to right all wrongs, he is the righteous Judge: as says the Apostle, Romans 12.
19.
Dearly beloved, avenge not your selves, but rather give place unto wrath: for,
it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.

Thirdly, A man that auengeth himself on his enemy, is like unto the dog
that runs after the stone that 3 Be avenged rather on thine own sins.
is cast at him, barks, and bites at the stone, and regards not the hand
that cast the stone: the cause of strife and dissension is from the Devil: the
Devil casts some stone of dissension, to cause a man to be offended: and for a
man's own sins, God of times raises up some adversary against a man, to
vex, and trouble him, that he may humble him; Do not thou then with the dog,
maliciously set thy self against thine enemy, seeking to be avenged on him,
but let thine eyes look to the hand that cast the stone: humble thy self
before God for thine own sins, which have deserved that the stone should be
cast at thee: and in any case, avenge not thy self, but commit thy self, and
thy cause to God that judges righteously.

Secondly, this doctrine of patience in suffering 2 A against those that go to
law for small offenses, and the least injuries.
wrongs, in all the sorts and degrees thereof, reprooues those, who, though
they can, it may be, moderate their passions in some measure from rash anger,
and bridle their tongues from reproachful speeches; yea, and hold their hands
from fighting; yet, for small offenses, and the least injuries, will take a
course by law, and sue their neighbor, if they have never so little advantage
by law; if the wrong done either by word, or deed, will bear an action, then
forth with to the law. But it has been declared, that a man ought to use the
law but for necessity; not for every offense, nor for every wrong, but for
great wrongs, and offenses of the highest nature. Men should go to law, as
they go to Physic; if a man should for every distemper in his body, for
every pain and grief, go to Physic, he would in the end bring his body to a
low state, and cause it to decay: so, if a man for every offense, and
trespass, for every wrong and injury, will be running to law, and accustom
himself to that troublesome, and unpeaceable course of life; he may in the end
bring himself to a low state, and cause his substance to decay: wherefore S.
Paul says, Gal. 5. 15.
If ye bite and devour one another, take heed ye be not consumed one of
another. And howsoever a contentious, and an unpeaceable minded man may be
perhaps well for his outward state; yet concerning his soul, he can be in no
good state: for a man that is given to continual contentions, and
tearmelysuits of law, has little quietness of mind; and is in great danger
to loose charity, meekness, patienc, yea peace of conscience. The want of
this patience in suffering wrong, is a great cause of so many needless, and
some endless suits in law: and those many times for small wrongs, and
injuries; which, and greater then those, many a patient minded man, would have
been content to have put up. Hence it is, that Courts are so full of matters of
controversy. 1 Cor. 6. 5.
I speak to your shame. says the Apostle, is it so that there is not a wise
man amongst you? no not one shall be able to judge between his brethren? what?
none that is able, or wise enough to judge of your controversies, but you must
needs go to law one with another? I dare say it, that if men had this rare
gift of patience, to suffer wrong, at least in some measure, there would not be
such suites at law; but matters of controversy might be ended, by some
discreet men without law; except they were wrongs of a high nature; as
endangering a man's life; or bringing infamy, and reproach to his good name: or
except they were trialls of titles of possessions, and inheritance: other
lesser matters might be ended at home.

Thirdly, here, they also are reproved, who are hard-hearted 3 Against those
that will not forgive their enemies.
against those that have offended them, and will not be moved to forgive them;
and if they do forgive them; it is with some, but from the lips, and not from
the heart. But we ought to forgive our enemies, Reasons to move us,
and that freely.

First, we ought to forgive our enemies, and that, 1 To forgive: because


First, because Christ bids us forgive. Luke 17. 3. 4.
If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgive
him. And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, 1 God commands
us.
and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent, thou shall
forgive him.

Secondly, because Christ forgave his enemies, as has 2 Christ forgave his
enemies.
been formerly showed, and therefore we ought to forgive our enemies.

Thirdly, except we forgive, we can have no forgiveness our selves. If we
forgive not men, God will not 3 Except we forgive, we cannot be forgiven.
forgive us: Mat. 6. 14. 15
If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly father will also forgive
you; says our Savior Christ; but, If ye forgive not men their trespasses,
neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

So Christ our Savior teaches us to pray, y forgive us, Verse. 12.
as we forgive: teaching us thereby a necessity of forgiving one another, as we
would have God to forgive us. For, no man can pray with his heart, Father
forgive, with any assurance, that God will forgive him, except he have a heart
to forgive his brother.

Secondly, we are not only to forgive, but to forgive 2 To forgive freely.
freely, and from the heart: some, it may be, may be persuaded, to be friends
in outward show, be pleased for the present, to join hands, and perhaps, when
they meet together, to move the cap, and say, Good morrow, and good even; and
yet secretly carry a grudge, and owe their neighbor an ill turn; and if
opportunity serve, will pay it him. This forgiveness is counterfeit, and
dissembling, not from the heart: but our Savior teaches us to forgive one
another Mat. 18. 35.
from our hearts. The hearty forgiveness is the true forgiveness. I conclude
this point, with the exhortation of the Apostle S. Paul, Ephe. 4. 32.
Be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God
for Christ's sake has forgiven you. Now, God for Christ's sake does forgive us
freely; so ought we, and so let us, freely, and from our hearts, forgive one
another.

CHAP. XX. Of Reformation of life.
THe second outward sign of true, justifying faith, is, Reformation of life.
That the reformation 2 Reformation of life.
of a man's former evil course of life, is an apparent sign, and evident
testimony of true faith in Christ, is verified by that saying of S. Paul, 2.
Cor. 5. 17.
if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Now, to be in Christ; is, to
have true faith in Christ, whereby a Christian is ingrafted into Christ, is
made a member of Christ, and lives in Christ, as the branch in the vine: for by
faith Christ lives in us, and we in him. As St Paul says of himself. Gal. 2.
20.
I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives
in me, and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the
Son of God. By faith we abide in Christ, yea, dwell in Christ, and he in us.
And the outward sign of this our being in Christ by faith, is, to be a new
creature. Ioh. 15. 1. 2.
I am the true vine, says Christ, and my Father is the husbandman* Every
branch in me that bears not fruit, he takes away. Ostendens sine operibus
neminem in Christo esse posse. Chrysostom. in Ioh Hom. 75.
Showing thereby, that without works no man can be in Christ. Christ is the
true vine, and every faithful soul is a branch of that vine: and is known to
be in Christ, to have faith in Christ, by the fruits of a godly life. If any
man be in Christ, having true, justifying faith, he is also sanctified by the
spirit of God, he is renewed inwardly in his mind, and reformed outwardly in
his life, and conversation. He is a changed man, he is not the same man that he
was before; for his heart is now purified by faith, and his conscience is
purged from dead works to serve the living God: if any man be in Christ, and
have Christ dwelling in his heart by faith, he has a new heart, a new mind, a
new will, new affections, new desires, new purposes, and new resolutions; he
has new eyes, new ears, a new tongue, new hands, and new feet: all is new:
not in regard of the Nulla substantia n^ua c^nditur, qualitas duntaxat
immutatur. Bez.
substance, either of soul, or body; but of the quality, and condition
thereof; for the faculties and powers of the soul, as also the parts and
members of the body, remain the same: but in the new creation, the evil
qualities and dispositions, the evil conditions of the inner, and outward man,
are changed. The understanding, that before was dark through ignorance, is now
enlightened with saving knowledge: the will which before was froward, perverse,
and stubborn, is now framed to the will of God: and the affections which were
rebellious, disordered, and disobedient, in the new creation, are brought into
order, and framed to holy obedience. The eye, that has offended by wandering,
lusting, and coveting; is now made a modest, chaste, sober, and contented eye.
The tongue, that has either offended God, by blasphemy, swearing, cursing, or
any way taking the name of God in vain; or grieved a man's neighbor, by
railing words, reuiling and reproachful speeches, by lying, slandering,
backbiting, false accusing, detracting from the credit and estimation of
others; is now, in the new creation, made to be a tongue honourring God,
praising and blessing God: a tongue abhorring lies, and speaking the truth unto
his neighbor; a tongue speaking well to others, and of others; and of a
fiery, inflamed, contentious tongue; it is now, a cool, quiet, and peaceable
tongue. The hands also that have offended, by fighting, hurting, wounding,
killing; by violence, cruelty, oppression, extortion, robbing, and by being
unmercifully shut against the poor; in the new creation, and change of life,
are made peaceable, forbearing, innocent, and harmless; yea, merciful,
liberal, and open to the poor and needy. And the feet which were swift to
shed blood, and walked in the ways of wickedness, are now refrained from
every evil way.

The consideration of this, that reformation of life, is a sign of true faith;
has a twofold use. It serves,

First, for instruction: to teach us, as many as have To give testimony of our
faith by a godly life. The necessity thereof.
of our faith by a godly life, and holy conversation. This is necessary for
every one that has the true faith, and makes a profession of the Gospel of
Christ; for a man by his godly life, and holy conversation, does three things,
which are excellent in a Christian. For hereby,

First, he glorifies God. Matthew. 5. 16.
Let your light so shine before 1 Glorifying God.
men, says our Savior, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
father which is in heaueuen. And again, he says, Ioh. 15. 8.
Herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit. By which, our
Savior gives us to understand, that when Christians so live, that they are
seen and known to bring forth the fruit of good works; when then so live, as
that they are good examples to others; when that they so lead their lives, as
that by their godly conversation, honest behavior, and unblameable life, they
shine before men: hereby they glorify God, they honor God, and cause men to
bless God, for the good things which they see in them.

Secondly, he adornes the Gospel of Christ, and is an 2 Adorning the Gospel
of Christ.
ornament to his profession: for this cause, the Apostle beseeches the
Ephesians to Ephesians. 4. 1.
walk worthy of the vocation wherewith they were called. And exhorting the
Philippians to a godly conversation, he says, Phil. 1. 27.
Let your conversation be, as it becomes the Gospel of Christ. 3 Stopping
the mouths of those, which speak evil of the way of the Lord.


Thirdly, he stops the mouths of those, which are ready to open their mouths,
and speak evil of them that fear God; when they shall see and perceive
plainly, that they which profess the Gospel of Christ, in sincerity, do
labor to walk conscionably before God, and toward men: when they shall see,
that they live Phil. 2. 15.
blameless and harmless, the sonne^ of God, without rebuke. In a word, when
a Christian, through sanctification of the Spirit, is careful to live in
obedience to the Commandments of God, laboring and endeavoring, with
Zachary and Elizabeth, to Luke 1. 6.
walk in all the Commandments of the Lord, blameless: this godly
conversation, and vnbl^meable life, is able to stop the mouths of profane and
wicked people: as S. Peter also says, 1 Pet. 2. 12.
Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak
against you as evil doers, they may by your good works, which they shall
behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. And again, exhorting them to
walk conscionably, he says, 1 Pet. 3. 16.
Having a good conscience, that whereas they speak evil of you, as of evil
doers, they may be ashamed, that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.

Secondly, this serves to reprove those, who vainly Christ, are members

of Christ, have faith in Christ; and yet are not reformed in their lives. But
the truth is; if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; he is a new man;
he has put off the old man, which is corrupt, and has put on the new man,
which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. In the new
creation, there is alteration and change, in the mind, in the will and
affections; in the eyes, ears, tongue, hands, etc: then look upon thy self,
o man; search thy self within, and view thy self without; is thy mind the
same that it has been formerly? does it still mind earthly things? is thy
heart as much set upon the world, as ever it was? are thy affections as
disordered, and thy passions as unruly, as in former-time? and do thy old
corruptions remain in their full strength? is there no change, nor alteration
in the inner man? and the eye the same that it has been? as Iustfull, as
wanton and wandering, as coveting as before? is the tongue the same that it has
been, for swearing, and lying, and slandering, for railing, and reuiling, and
filthy speaking? are thy hands the same, for hurting thy neighbor, or any
thing that is his? are they as heavy upon thy poor neighbor, as they have
been, through violence, oppression, unmercifulness, or by any manner of
vn^ust and unconscionable dealing? and perceiuest thou no change? is there no
reformation, nor amendment of life? is thy heart as corrupt as before? thy eye
as wicked as before? thy tongue as devilish as before? and thy hands as cruel
and catching as before? judge hereby, in what a dangerous state thou
remainest, as long as thou thus remainest, not changed, not renewed, nor
reformed. For whosoever finds in himself no alteration from evil, nor
reformation of his former evil course, nor any good change of life; he is no
new creature: and if he be not a new creature, then he is not in Christ; if he
be not in Christ, then has he no true faith in Christ, and whosoever has not
true faith in Christ, cannot be saved. So that without reformation, there is no
salvation. By this, then, the profane, wicked, and ungodly man may see his
danger: the common ordinary swearer, the prophaner of the Saboth, the contemner
of Gods Word, the disobedient, the cruel, malicious, and unmerciful man, the
proud, the formcator and adulterer, the drunkard, the covetous, the oppressor,
the usurer and extortioner, the false accuser, the slanderer, etc? these, and
such like, may all see their fearful and dangerous state, none of which, as
long as they are such, can say truly, that they are in Christ, neither have
they true faith in Christ, because they are not new creatures: for had they
true faith in Christ, they would show some good sign of their faith: and this
is a plain and evident sign of faith, to be a new creature, to forsake our
old conversation, and hence-forward to live in newness of life. The
consideration whereof, ought to be of force, to rowze up the dull spirits of
all such as are yet a sleep in sin: to awaken them, and cause them earnestly
to go about this great and necessary work of Reformation of life: knowing
this, that our new-reformed life, gives evident testimony of our faith in
Christ.

CHAP. XXI. Of works of Mercy.
Works of mercy, are the third outward 3 Works of Mercy.
sign and mark of true justifying faith. By works of mercy, and deeds of
charity, I understand such works as come 1 Timothy 1. 5.
out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: as says
S. Paul. For the faith whereof I entreat, is that, which as S. Paul says, Gal.
5 6.
works by love. And not that vain and unprofitable faith, which S. James
calls a Iam. 2. 17.
dead faith. And that works of mercy, and deeds of charity, proceeding from a
heart purified by faith, and from such a one, as is justified by faith in
Christ, are good outward signs, and evident testimonies of true justifying
faith; the Scripture witnesses. S. Paul to Titus, says, Tit. 3. 17.
These things I will, that thou affirm constantly, that they which have
believed in God, might be careful to maintain good works. S. James demands
of vain men, which boast of faith without works, J^m. 2. 14, 15, 16, 17.
What does it profit my brethren, though a man say he has faith, and have not
works? can faith faith save him? if a brother or sister be naked, and
destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, depart in peace, be thou
warmed, and filled, notwithstanding ye give them not those things, which are
needful to the body, what does it profit? even so faith, if it has not
works, is dead being alone. If a man see a poor Christian, naked, and cold,
and hungry, and say unto him, alas poor soul, get thee to the fire and warm
thee; but does not bring him to the fire; if he say, get thee clothing to
cover thee, but gives him no garment; if he say, get thee meat, and fill thy
belly, but gives him no meat; these fair words profit the poor creature
nothing at all: these pitiful words do neither warm him, nor feed him, nor
cloth him. Now, if such a man say he has faith, he is much deceived: his
faith is a vain and unprofitable faith: for he shows no good sign of his
faith by his works. Mary, that devout woman, after that she had heard Christ
preach, and upon hearing, believed the Gospel, and had true faith in the Son
of God; brought the Matt. 26. 7.
box of very precious ointment, and powered it on the head of Jesus, as he sat
at meat. And Christ testifies of her, saying, Verse. 10.
she has wrought a good work upon me. Zacheus, after that the Lord had
graciously looked upon him, after that he was converted, and believed; begiones
to do good works, to deal his goods to the poor. Luke 19. 8.
Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor: before this, we hear
nothing of Zacheus giving to the poor; (or if he gave any thing, it was
little available to him, he remaining in impenitency and unbelief) but being
converted, and believing Christ, now we hear of his good works, now he
bestows alms, now he gives to the poor, yea, now he deals his goods
liberally to the poor. Half his goods he gives to the poor: good works are
said to be Externa testimonia inter^ae p^tatis.
outward testimonies of inward piety. And good works, though they be not the
meritorious N^n ^a^sa regnandi, sed via ad regnum. B^rn.
cause of obtaining the Kingdom of Heaven, yet they are the way to the
Kingdom. For as the Apostle says, Ephesians. 2. 10.
We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
has before ordained, that we should walk in them. Good works are not the
procuring, nor the deserving cause of salvation; but they are the effects and
fruits of true faith. Matt. 12. 33.
The tree is known by his fruit, says our Savior; a good tree is known to
be a good tree, by the good fruit it bears: the good fruit which it bears,
gives evident testimony to all men, that it is a good tree: now good works are
good fruits, whereby a good christian gives evident testimony, and a
demonstratiue sign of his true saving faith.

But here, I would have it understood, that I limit not works of mercy, and
deeds of charity, only to giving of The extent of Charity to all duties of
mercy; both corporal and spiritual.
alms, to feeding the hungry, and clothing the naked, etc But I extend works
of mercy in the largest sense, to all the duties of love, and charity to our
neighbor: to the charitable helping and succouring of any one, and every one,
that is in any present misery and distress; in any need of help, whether
corporal or spiritual.

In regard of corporal, and bodily help; to perform those duties required by
our Savior Mat. 25. 35. etc
Christ himself: as giving meat to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, taking
in the stranger, lodging the harbourlesse, clothing the naked, visiting the
sick, going to them that are in prison; also burying the dead, lending freely,
etc. and in regard of the souls of men; to show our charity, by instructing
them that are ignorant, admonishing them that walk in an ungodly way, in
meekness, to win them: to forgive offenses: to comfort them that mourn:
and to pray one for another, etc.

Furthermore, it is to be observed, that these works of mercy, and deeds of
charity, are to be showed, not only to our near neighbors, but to them also
that are a far off, if need require: and not only to our friends, and such as
wish us well, and love us; but even to our enemies. So our Savior commands us;
Luke 6. 35. 36.
love your enemies, and, be merciful, as your father also is merciful. Now,
our heavenly Father is merciful not only to the Math. 5. 45.
good, but to the evil, not only to the just, but to the unjust. and S. Paul
charge us thus, Romans 12. 20.
If thine enemy hunger, feed him: if he thirst, give him drink. this is the
extent of our charity.

But it may be demanded: If every Christian be necessarily bound, to give
testimony of his faith, by works Whether the poorer sort of people be bound to
do works o^ mercy.
of mercy, and deeds of charity, what then shall become of poor Christians?
for their are many poor christians which are sca^ce able to maintain
themselves, yea, many that have need sometimes to ask alms, and to be
relieved by others. How then shall such poor ones give testimony of their
faith by works of mercy?

I^ must be remembered, that works of mercy are of Mar^. 12. 41.
Cast money into the treasury of their superfluity, and abundance: he that has
not much to give, may give a penny; and he that is not able to give a penny,
may with the poor widow, give verse. 42.
two mites, which make a farthing. And if a man be destitute of silver and
gold, then he must give such as he has, a piece of bread; if he have not
bread, then a cup of drink; yea a Math. 10. 42.
cup of cold water given to a poor member of Christ, shall not be unrewarded,
as Christ himself has promised. And the Scripture says, 2. Cor. 8. 12.
If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man has,
and not according to that he has not. And yet more, if any christian be so
poor, and destitute, for outward things, that he is not able to show any
corporal mercy to other^, yet every christian, though never so poor, may, and
must show spiritual mercy, as far forth as he is able, instructing,
admonishing, and comforting others; and he must not cease to pray for others,
who have extended their charity to him, as S. Paul did for Onesciphorus, 2 Timothy
1. 16. 17. 18
the Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me,
and was not ashamed of my chain. But when he was in Rome, he sought me ought
very diligently, and found me. the Lord grant unto him, that he may find mercy
of the Lord in that day.

The consideration of this, that works of mercy (in To give testimony of our
faith, by our works of mercy and deeds of charity.
testimonies, of true, iustifiing, and saving faith serves,

First, to teach us, if we have true faith in deed; to give testimony of our
faith, by our works of mercy, and deeds of charity; by feeding the hungry,
clothing the naked, lodging strangers, visiting the sick, helping the
helpelesse, comforting the comfortless, and such like. And this is necessary:
for as good works are fruits of faith, (as has been formerlie proved) so are
they also evident signs, and good testimonies of our pure and sound religion.
So says S. James, Iam. 1. 27.
pure religion and undefiled before God, and the Father, is this, to visit the
fatherless, and the widows in their affliction, and to keep himself
unspotted of the world. Whosoever is truly religious; his pure, and true
religion should appear in this, that he is religious, not in show of words,
but in the substance of works; not so much in the tongue, as in the hand: not
so much in talking, as in doing. Timothy is commanded by S. Paul, to 1 Timothy 6.
17. 18. 19.
charge them that are rich in this world, that they do good, that they be rich
in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, laying up in
store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may
lay hold on eternal life. If through the blessing of God, men be rich in
goods, they ought also to be rich in good works: and seeing that God of his
goodness, has given them much goods, it ought to be their care, to do much
good. For this is expected, at our hands, both from God and men, that having
true faith, and being truly religious, we should abound in love one toward
another, and be fruitful in good works. Iam. 1. 27.
Visiting the fatherless, and widows in their affliction, as says S. James.
Isa. 1. 17.
Relieuing the oppressed, judging the fatherless, and pleading for the widow:
Isa. 58. 7.
dealing our bread to the hungry, bringing the poor that are cast out, to our
house, when we see the naked, to cover him, and that no man hide himself from
his own flesh: as says the Prophet Esaias.

Secondly, the consideration of this, that works of

First, coldness of charity. There is great need for us, 1 Against coldness
of charity.
to whom the dispensation of the Gospel is committed, to open our mouths, to
cry aloud, and to speak against this coldness of charity. For we live in
evil days, even in the last days, in which, as the Apostle has foretold, 2.
Tim. 3. 1. 2.
perilous times shall come, wherein men shall be lovers of their own selves,
covetous, etc.

And to the end, that men may perceive, whether their hearts be frozen over
with the cold ice of uncharitableness; or whether the Sun of righteousness
has shined upon them, and warmed their hearts with love, and Marks of
uncharitableness
charity; I will show wherein this coldness of charity chiefly consists.

It argues a coldness of charity,

First, to defer the poor; to put them off, and bid them come again another
time, when a man has now 1 To defer the poor.
to give them. This, Solamon reprooues, Pro. 3. 28.
Say not unto thy neighbor, go, and come again, and to morrow I will give,
when thou have it by thee.

Secondly, to give an alms or benevolence, with an 2 To give alms with an
unwilling mind.
unwilling mind, not with a free and cheerful heart. Against this the Apostle
speaks; 2. Cor. 9. 7.
every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give, not
grudgingly, or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.

Thirdly, to turn away the face, and to stop the ear, 3 To stop the ear at
the cry of the poor.
at the cry of the poor; to give them nothing, but suffer them to depart
empty; not to give them so much as scraps, or crummes, though they were never
so greatly distressed. This was the sin of Dives: for Luke 16. 20. 21
Lazarus lying at his gates full of sores, desired to be fed with the crummes
that fell from the rich man's cable. But the^rs no mention that he had either
bread or crummes; but the dogs came and licked his sores. Dives had his dogs,
and they were fed, but the poor beggar can get no relief. Ahab the King, in a
great drought, commanded Obadiah his servant, to 1. King. 18. 5.
go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: to see
if he could find grass, to save the horses and mules alive.

Ahab had not so much care of the poor people of the land, to save them alive
from perishing in the famine, as he had of the beasts, to ^a^e his horses and
mules alive. Dives is dead, and Ahab i^ dead: but they have left many
like-condition'd children behind them. For, there are many, whose charity
toward the poor, is so frozen and icie cold, that they make more account of

words, and so to send them away empty, argues a great coldness of charity.
Herein men are like to churlish Nabal: David in great necessity, sent his
servants to ask some relief of that rich, wealthy man, they ask in the name
of David; but Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? And who
is the son of loss? 1 Samuel 25. 10. 11.
There be many servants now adays, that break away every man from his
master. Shall I then take my bread and my water, and my flesh that I have
killed for my shearers, and give ^^ unto m^n, whom I know no^ wh^^^^ they be?
Thus, with Nabal to answer the poor, even such as ar^ poor in deed, and such
as we are bound in charity to relieve, when they ask, not in the name of
David, but in the name of the son of David, Christ Jesus, and to send them
away empty; is to give them a silly alms, and argues great coldness of
charity. By these things, every one may try what his charity is.

And if any one be yet uncharitable; if his heart will not be softened for all
this; I further offer to his consideration, this meditation: Dives for his
coldness of charity, is already in hell: his soul is tormented in hel-fire.
And Dives is in hell in torments, Non ideo damnatus, quod aliena tulerit, sed
quod egenti pa^peri sua n^n tribuerit. Aug.
not (as is observed) for taking away from the poor that which was theirs, but
for not giving to the poor of his own. And at the day of the Resurrection of
all flesh, Dives, and all the company of unmerciful men, shall both in soul
and body together, be cast into everlasting fire: as is evident by the words of
Christ the Judge, who, having set all the wicked, and unmerciful men at his
left hand, will say unto them, Mat. 25. 41. 42. 43.
depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and
his Angels. For, I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and
ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye
clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visitted me not. So that not
only the committing of great sins, of unrighteousness against our brethren,
as taking away from them, by violence, or any manner of wrong-dealing, their
lands, livings, houses, fields; or oppressing them with heavy burdens, etc.
but the very omitting of the necessary duties of charity, not giving part of
that portion, which God has given us, to the relieuing of the poor; the very
stopping of our ears at the cry of the poor: the closing of out hands against
the poor, and the shutting up of the bowels of compassion from them that are
in misery, and distress, is able to cast soul and body into hell.

Secondly, seeing that works of mercy and deeds 2 Against the neglect and
want of Hospitality.
of charity, are testimonies of true, justifying, and saving faith; this
justly reprooues the want of hospitality, and the great decay of ancient
housekeeping. In these days we may see many great, and fair houses, but in
few of them any good housekeeping: Great houses have both strait and wide
gates, but seldom open: many chimnies, but few fires. Now, that Hospitality
ought to be maintained; the Scripture is very plain for it. S. Paul exhorts
all Christians generally, (as their ability will reach) to Romans 12. 13.
distribute to the necessity of Saints, and to be given to hospitality. St
Peter also exhorts us to 1 Pet. 4. 9.
use hospitality one to another without grudging. And in particular, a Bishop
is charged by S. Paul, to be 1. Tim. 3. 2.
given to hospitality. If we look into the lives of the Patriarchs, and holy
men in former Ages, we shall find them given to hospitality. Abraham sitting
in his tent door, sees three men traveling on their journey; seeing them, he
Genesis 18. 2. etc.
ran to meet them, and entreated them earnestly to come into his tent, to
eat meat with him. So did Lot use hospitality; he gave intertainment to the
Genesis 19. 1. etc.
two Angels which came to Sodom at even, in the likeness of two men. And Job
was a man given to hospitality: for he says, that he did Job 31. 17.
not eat his morsel himself alone, but the fatherless did eat thereof.

Now, upon diligent inquiry, what shouldbet he cause The cause of the decay of
Hospitality in our Land.
that hospitality is much decayed in our land: I can find no other cause but
Sin, and the judgment of God upon men, and their houses for Sin. If this
be too general 1 In general. Sin.
an answer; I come to particulars, and affirm, that first, one cause of the
decay of ancient hospitality, is, contentious suing at law: from whence, it
comes 2 In particular.
to pass, that both he that sue^h, and he that is sued; he that troubles, and

unable to maintain hospitality. It were good, that such would be warned by
that saying of the Apostle, Gal. 5. 15.
If ye bite and devour one another, take heed ye be not consumed one of
another.

Secondly, another cause is excess in eating, and drinking: 2 Excesle in
cating and drinking.
gluttony and drunkenness: whereby, many are brought to such a poor state,
and beggarly condition, that they are not able to keep hospitality. Of this,
Solamon says, Pro. 23. 20. 21.
Be not amongst Wine-bibbers, amongst riotous eaters of flesh, for the drunkard
and the glutton shall come to poverty.

The third cause, is Whoredom. Job says of Whoredom, and Adultery, Ioh. 31.
12.
it is a fire that consumes to destruction, 3 Whoredom.
and will root out all a man's increase. The voluptuous, riotous prodigal,
mispends so much in reuelling, banqueting, drinking, and whoring; that all
that he can rake, and scrape from his poor, ract-tenants, is not sufficient to
maintain himself; much less to keep hospitality.

The fourth, is Pride in apparel: when men wear apparel 4 Pride in apparel.
past decency, and go far above their degree. This Pride is a deuourer.
They carry so much wealth upon their own backs, that the poor are robbed, and
pincht both of back and belly.

The fifth, is violence and oppression: when men enter 5 Oppression.
unjustly into the possessions, and inheritance of other men: this pulls down
the judgment of God upon their own heads. Isa. 5. 8. 9.
Woe unto them, says the Prophet Esaias, that join house to house, that lay
field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the
midst of the earth: in mine ears says the Lord of hosts, of a truth many
houses shall be desolate, even great and fair without inhabitant. All fair,
and stately houses are not so happy, as to enjoy the end of their building,
habitation: much less, hospitality.

The sixth, is Sacrilege: worldly, and unconscionable 6 Sacrilege.
minded men think, if they can withold and keep any thing back from
Churchmen, those sheaues, and those tithes will help well toward the
maintenance of their housekeeping, and make them more able to keep
hospitality: but its quite contrary: for the tithes, and sheaues unjustly
withheld, and unconscionably taken from the Church; are so laid up in the
barnes, and garners of those that spoil the Church, that they secretly, though
the just judgment of God, eat into, and consume the rest of their wealth and
substance. Like as Josh 6 19. And Chap. 7. 21, 24. 25.
Achans wedge of gold which he took, being consecrated unto the Lord, was the
cause of the destruction of all that he had. And although many Laymen, have
great, yearly-profites coming in, by unjust gathered tithes, yet, (see the
judgment of God upon them) they are thereby never a whit the richer: but
rather in poorer state then their ancestors, who kept as great, or greater
hospitality then they do, and yet robbed no Churches. So that their devouring
of consecrated things, does no whit help their hospitality; and it hinders
Churchmen from keeping that hospitality, which otherwise they might, and
ought. Against this Sacrilege, the Lord himself complains by the Prophet
Malachie, Mal. 3 8. 9.
Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, wherein have we
robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse. He says not
barely, ye are cursed, but ye are cursed with a curse. He doubleth the curse,
to show the certainty, and greatness of the curse: Whosoever robs God of his
tithes, and offerings, draws a curse upon himself: when he binds up the
sheafe unjustly taken, he binds in the curse, and when he lays it up in his
barn, he lays up the curse with it: and the cursed sheafe eats in, and
spreads it self into the rest of the sheaues, and corn, and substance: like
the plague of Leprosy, infecting all the rest.

These are the true causes of the decay, and present want of Hospitality. Now,
if there be no Hospitality; then mercy and compassion is not showed to the
poor and needy, to the strangers, to the fatherless, and widows: and if
mercy and charity be not showed, at least, in some sort, and in some measure,
more or less, as every man's ability will extend, I demand then, Where is
Faith? Is that true Faith that has no works? Can that Faith save? Nay. For
Iam. 2. 17.
Faith, as St James says, if it has not works, is dead being alone. And Ver.
26.
as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

CHAP. XXII. Of confession of Christ before men: and of the profession of the
Gospel.
THe fourth and last outward sign of true saving Faith, is the Confession of
Christ before men: 4 Confession of Christ before men.
with constancy and boldness, standing to our faith and profession, for the
love of Christ. S. Paul makes this a sign of his faith; saying to the
Corinthians, Ex his discimus confessionis matrem esse fidem. Calu.
We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed,
and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak. 2. Cor. 4.
13.
From hence we learn, that faith is the mother of confession. Faith breeds
confession: according to that saying of S. Paul to the Romans: Romans 10. 10.
With the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth
confession is made unto salvation.

And this Confession of Christ is twofold. Twofold.

The one, in time of peace. 1 In time of peace. Twofold.

The other, in time of persecution.
The Confession of Christ, in time of peace, is twofold:
The first is, not to be ashamed of the profession of the 1 Not to be ashamed
of the profession of the Gospel. For,
Gospel: but to make an open confession, and manifest profession thereof. And
this is necessary; For,

First, God requires it; 1. P^t. 3. 15.
Be ready always, says S. Peter, to give an answer to every man that asks
you a reason of the hope that is in you: we have examples hereof. S. 1 God
requires it.
Paul was not ashamed of the preaching of the Gospel: for to the Romans he
says, Romans 1. 16.
I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. The Romane-beleeuers, in S. Paul's
time, were not ashamed of the profession of the Gospel: for of them he says,
Romans 1. 8.
Your faith is spoken of thorowout the wh^le world. And the believers among the
Thessalonians, were not ashamed of the profession of their faith; for of them
also S. Paul says, 1. These. 1. 8.
In every place your faith to God ward is spread abroad.

Secondly, to confess Christ before men, has a promise; 2 A promise to them
that confess Christ.
and to deny Christ, has a threatening annexed unto it. Mat. 10. 32. 33
Whosoever, says our Savior, shall confess me before men, him will I
confess also before my father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me
before men, him will I also deny before my father which is in heaven. For thus
will Christ the righteous Judge say unto his Father, at the day of the
Resurrection: These, o Father, on my right hand, are they which have confessed
me before men, they were not ashamed of me* I acknowledge them for mine: Mat.
25 34.
Come ye blessed of my F^ther, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world. But as for these on my left hand, o Father, these are
they that denied me before men, they were ashamed of me, they would not stand
unto their faith and profession; I acknowledge them not; Mat. 25. 12.
I know you not. Ver. 41.
Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and
his Angels. This is the first kind of confessing Christ before men, in the
time of peace.

The second, is, to be constant in our profession, to 2 To be constant in our
profession, and to stand unto the truth.
stand unto the truth which we profess, not to shrink back, not to be
wavering minded; but to hold fast the truth, to speak for it, and defend it.
S. Paul gives us this worthy exhortation. 1 Cor. 16. 13.
Watch ye, stand fast in the Faith, quit you like men: be strong. Thus are we
to make confession of Christ, before men in the time of peace.

The consideration whereof, serves to reprove

First, those who faint, and are discouraged either to 1 Against those that are
fearful to profess the Gospel by reason of some disgrace-full speeches
unjustly cast upon them that profess the Gospel.
enter upon, or to hold on the profession of godliness, by reason of the
disgraceful speeches, which some ill minded men do cast upon the professors
of religion: there are diverse, who, hearing the Gospel preached, conceive a
good liking of it; and hearing moreover, and understanding, that the
professors of religion are careful to worship God, publicly, and privately;
that they are careful to sanctify the Sabbath, to frequent the house of God,
to hear Sermon^, etc. Furthermore, perceiving that the best, and most sincere
professors, do endeavor to live a godly, a righteous, and a sober life; and
as much as in them lies, labor to live blameless; they cannot but
acknowledge, that all this is good; and worthy their imitation; and gladly they
would imitate them, and be like unto them, but that they fear they should be
mocked, pointed at, and branded with the name of Precisian, Puritan,
Sectarist, etc. Such fearful, and faint-hearted Christians, are herein like to
Io^. 3. 1. 2.
Nicodemus, who came to Jesus by night. And like to Ioh. 19. 38.
Joseph of Arimathea, who was a Disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of
the Jews. But consider, I beseech you, all ye that are thus fearful to make
an open profession of Christ; what though the world hate you, and speak evil
of you, and persecute you? is it not a religious cause? is it not for the name
of Christ? and will you be ashamed of Christ? Nay, you ought not to faint, nor
be discouraged, in the profession of godliness, nor yet to be afraid to
confess Christ before men, though you suffer for the name of Christ; for this
is the portion of the righteous in this life, to be afflicted, persecuted, and
troubled; and concerning this, I say with S. Peter, 1. Pet. 4. 16.
If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify
God on this behalf. A servant that attends upon a great man of place, is not
ashamed to wear his cognizance, and to be known to belong unto him, but
esteems it his credit, and accounts it his honor, to be known, and noted,
that he is servant to such a worthy Gentleman, or that he belongs to such an
honorable person: so every Christian ought much more to rejoice; and glory in
this, that he is the servant of Jesus Christ. Now, that which makes a Christian
known to be the servant of Jesus Christ, is, not to be ashamed of the Gospel
of Christ, it is his constant confession of Christ, and the open, manifest
profession of his Faith and Religion before men, joining thereunto a godly
life, having his conversation as it becomes the Gospel of Christ.

And a Christian ought to be so far from being ashamed of the profession of
the Gospel, that he ought to glory therein, and count it his greatest honor,
that he is servant to so great a Lord, as the Lord Jesus. 2 Against those who
are still doubtful, and not settled in judgment for the truth of Religion.


Secondly, this reproues those, who are doubtful, inconstant, and wavering in
matters of religion, not settled in judgment for the truth of religion; being
neither good Protestants, nor right Papists: holding something of both, and
holding constantly to neither. To such, I may say, as Elijah the Prophet said
to the seduced Israelites, in the days of King Ahab; 1 Kin. 18. 21.
How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him: but
if Baal, then follow him: How long halt ye between two religions of
Protestants and Papist^? If the Lord be God, follow him, and worship him in
spirit and truth, as he has commanded: but if Baal be God, if to worship
Saints, and to bow down before Images, be the true worship of God; then follow
them. For if a man have faith, its necessary, that he also confess the truth
of his faith, with his mouth, and profess the same in his life.

Thirdly, seeing that a Christian is to give testimony of his faith by outward
profession, then what faith has 3 Against lukewarm professors.
the lukewarm Christian, which is neither hot nor cold? Some are so
indifferent for matters of religion, that they care not greatly of what
religion they be, so they be of any. There are others, who, as they would not
be too irreligious, and profane, not exceedingly wicked, and vile in their
life; so they are afraid of being noted to be too precise in their carriage,
too zealous, too holy: such are lukewarm Christians, neither hot nor cold:
neither so cold, as to be of no religion; nor so hot, as to be sincere in the
profession of godliness. Such lukewarm professors, are abominable in the
sight of God, and even loathed of him. As is manifest, in the reprehension of
the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans, Reu. 3. 14. 15. 16.
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot, I would thou were
cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I
will spew thee out of my mouth: here are two things said of these Laodiceans;
one, is concerning the state of that Church, for their profession of religion:
they are noted to be lukewarm, neither cold nor hot: the other, is there
judgment, and punishment for their lukewarmenesse in religion: except they be
more zealous and repent, the Lord will spew them out of his mouth: that is, the
Lord will loath, and abhor them, and will cast them out from him, even as a
man's stomach loathes lukewarm, water, casting it up again.

And this, of the confession of Christ before men, in 2 In time of persecution.
time of peace.

There is also a confession of Christ, to be made of every good christian, in
time of persecution. And that Twofold.
is also twofold.

The first, is, to stand boldly in the defense of our 1 To stand to our faith
when we are called in question for it.
faith, and religion, if we be called in question for it. This our Savior
Christ taught his Disciples: Math. 10. 17. 18. 19.
Beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the Councills, and they will
scourge you in their Synagognes. And ye shall be brought before governors and
Kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. But when they
deliver you up, take no thought, how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be
given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. A worthy example hereof,
there is in Peter, and John the Apostles of Christ, who preaching Jesus Christ,
and working miracles through his name, were called before the rulers of the
Jews, and examined about the healing of the creeple, Act 4 7.
by what power, or by what name have ye done this? then Peter, with great
courage, and boldness answered, ver. 8. 9. 10.
Ye rulers of the people and elders of Israel, if we this day be examined of
the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole, be it
known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel. that by the name of Jesus
Christ of nazareth, whom ye crucify, whom God raised from the dead, even by
him, does this man stand here before you whole. Here was the constant
confession of Christ by these Apostles, standing to their faith when they were
called in question for it, and that with courage, and great boldness yea
further, when the rulers called the Apostles, ver. 18. 19. 20.
And commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach in the Name of Jesus, Peter
and John answered and said unto them, whether it be right in the sight of God
to hearken unto you more the^ unto God judge ye. For we cannot but speak the
things which we have seen and heard. See still their constant confession of
there faith in Jesus Christ: they believed and therefore they spoke this is the
first kind of confessing Christ in time of persecution.

The second i^, to stand boldly in the defense of our 2 To stand in the defense
of our faith unto the death.
faith even unto death; and not to deny Christ, though we loose our life for
Christ's sake. Memorable is the example of the three children of the Captivity,
who, being threatened to be cast into the fiery furnace, because they would not
worship the golden Image which Nebuchadnezzar had set up, did notwithstanding
stick fast unto the worship of the true God of Heaven and earth. when the King
threatened them with the fiery furnace, they were not afraid of the fire, but
with courage, and boldness, thus confidently answered the king, Dan. 3. 16.
17. 18.
O Nebuchad-nezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be
so, our God whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, o King. But if not, be it
known unto thee o King; that we will not serve thy Gods, nor worship thy
golden image which thou have set up. This was the constancy of the Apostle S.
Paul: when the Prophet Agabus took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and
feet, and prophesied, that so the Jews at Jerusalem should bind the man that
owed that girdle; and when the believers, with whom Paul was, heard these
things, and wept, and besought him, that he would not go to Jerusalem, Paul
answered; Acts. 21. 13.
What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? For I am ready not to be
bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the Name of the Lord Jesus. Such
was the constancy of the faithful, in the times of the most cruel
persecutions, both before Christ, and since.

Before Christ; as is manifest in the diverse sufferings of the Saints of God,
mentioned by the Apostle to the Hebrews: Heb. 11. 35. 36. 37. 38.
others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a
better resurrection. And other had trial of cruel mockings, and scourgings,
yea moreover, of bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawen a
sunder, were tempted, were stain with the sword: they wandered about in
sheepe-skins, and goat skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom
the world was not worthy: they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in
denns and caves of the earth. And after Christ, from Steven Protomartyr, the
first that suffered for the name of Christ, and so downward, to these times; as
many as have suffered in deed, and in truth, for the testimony of Jesus; have
with constancy, and boldness, with courage and rejoicing, endured any
torments, that cruel persecutors could invent against them; and spared not
their lives for his sake, that gave his life for them: Acts. 7. 59. 60
Steven was stoned to death: and and prayed for his persecutors, Lord lay not
this sin to their charge. Eusebius. l. 2. c. 25.
Paul was beheaded: id. l. 3. c. 1.
Peter was crucified with his head downward. Acts. 12. 2.
James the brother of John was killed with the sword. Ignatius was cast to the
wild beasts: it was he that said, Frumentum Dei sum, ac dentibus bestiarum
commolior, vt mundus panis inu^^iar. ibid. c 33.
I am Gods corn, the beasts must grind me in their teeth, that I may be pure
bread. Polycarpus, with great constancy, endured to be burned, rather then he
would deny Christ, or reproach the name of Christ, whom he had Octagin^^ seu
annos illi seruio, nec me vlla in re lesit vnquam, and quomedo possum male
dicere regi meo, qui me serua^it? id. l. 4. c. 15.
served (as he acknowledges) fourscore and six years, and in all that time,
says he, Christ has done me no manner of harm, but has saved me, how then
can I blaspheme my Lord and King? yea, l. 8. c. 12.
Eusebius reports that so many christians, in so many places of the world did
suffer for the name of Christ, and so constantly did they endure the cruel
torments which wicked men did invent against them, that the very beholders were
astonished to see the manlike fortitude, and to perceive, the constant
resolution of those holy martyrs.

These are they which are now Reu. 7. 9. 14.
clothed with white robes, having palms in their hands: and these are they
which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes; and made them
white in the blood of the Lamb.

The consideration of this constancy in the profession Against the temporary
faith, and formal profession
the name of Christ; serves to reprove those, who have but a temporary faith,
and a formal profession. Many in time of prosperity, in the Sunshine, and
flourishing state of the Gospel, when there is peace, and prosperity in the
land; make a glorious profession: but if trouble and persecution arise for the
Gospels sake, then they pull in their heads, draw back, and in the end fall
away from their profession: denying their faith and profession, rather then
they will suffer death for the name of Christ. Ecclesiastical histories
mention, that diverse weak Christians in the times of grievous persecutions,
denied Christ before men, and sacrificed to Idols: though many of them
afterward repented, and were received into the bosom of the Church again.

Our own Acts and Monuments tell us of the like: amongst which, memorable is
the example of one Denton a Blacksmith, who being a professor of the Gospel,
delivered unto Wolsey a friend of his, the book of the holy Scriptures,
telling him that it was the truth. After this, his friend Wolsey, whom he had
been a means to convert unto the truth, was cast into prison for his
conscience sake; and being in prison, sent unto the said Denton, signifying
unto him, that he marueiled that he tarried so long behind him, seeing he had
delivered unto him the Scripture, and knew that it was the truth. Denton
returned him this answer; I confess, it is the truth, but alas, I cannot
burn. But he that could not burn in the cause of Christ, was afterward
burned against his will: for his house being set on fire, whiles he went to
save his goods, he lost his life.

A good and sound Chrishan ought to be so affected toward Christ Jesus, as a
loving spouse, as a chaste, and modest wife to her own husband: a chaste, and
faithful wife will by no means, by no promises, nor allurements, by no
threatenings, nor torments, be drawn or forced to forsake her dear husband:
but will be faithful unto him to the death, and resolutely say, Moriar Alcide,
tua. Sen.
O dear husband, I will die thine: So a good Christian soul, the spouse of
Christ, will by no means, by no persuasions, nor threatenings, for no torments,
nor for any fear of death, be moved to forsake Christ, but will remain
faithful unto Christ, even unto death: and with resolution of heart, say, O
dear Savior, I will die thine. He that will build a tower, and does not first
sit down and count the cost, whether he has sufficient to finish it, is held
by our Savior Luke 14. 28. 29
Christ to be an unwise man. And such an unwise man is he, who before he
enters upon this great work of the profession of Christian religion, does not
first sit down, and count what it may cost him. It may be, he shall hear
mockings, reproachful, and disgraceful speeches, in regard of his very
profession: he may for Christ's sake, suffer loss in his goods, yea, it may
be, his profession may cost him his life. Now then a wise man is to consider
aforehand, that as its necessary, that he do confess the name of Jesus, and
that he make a profession of godliness, so having once taken upon him the
profession of the Gospel, there is no shrinking, no going back; Luke 9 62.
he that puts his hand to this plow, and looks back, is not fit for the
Kingdom of God. A Christian having taken upon him the profession of the
Gospel, ought in no wise to go back from his profession, nor to deny his
faith, though it cost him his life: least he be like to that foolish builder,
who began to build, and was not able to finish.

To conclude: It ought to be the care of every good Christian, first, to get
true faith into his heart: next, to nourish his faith, that it may be
preserved, and continued to the end: then, to show forth the fruits of his
faith, by patience in afflictions, and suffering wrongs: by reformation and
amendment of life: by works of mercy: and lastly, to make confession of Christ
before men, and not to be afraid, nor ashamed of the profession of the Gospel,
but to stand fast in the faith, and to be constant in the same: yea, to live,
and die therein. This is the way to life everlasting. As CHRIST says to the
Angel of the Church in Smyrna, Reu. 2. 10.
Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a Crown of life. ()

esse in animae. Tho. 3. q 85. ar. 6.
Virtues and graces are wrought together in the soul. True faith and sound
repentance are joined together, they are inseparable companions: but yet in
regard of order of nature, faith is first; though Repentance show it self
first, in the act of repentance; as in godly sorrow for sin, in the humble
confession of sin, and in earnest prayer to God for the pardon of sin. For
these show that there is now already faith in the heart, which produces such
good effects.

The subject matter then of this Treatise following, is Repentance: a way,
wherein we must walk, or else we shall never enter in at the gate of the
Celestial Paradise: a thing so necessary, without which we can neither have
remission of our sins, nor salvation of our souls: without which, we can
neither have true comfort to our souls in this life, nor felicity in the life
to come. For which cause it is, that S. Peter gives this exhortation to the
Jews which crucified Christ, Acts 3. 19.
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out,
when the times of refreshing shall come, from the presence of the Lord. In the
handling of Repentance; I will show,

First, what Repentance is. Secondly, the parts of Repentance. The partition of
this Treatise.
Thidly, the manner how a Sinner may truly repent: and what things are
necessarily required to true and sound Repentance. Fourthly, the time of
Repentance, when a sinner is necessarily bound to repent. Fifthly, the
impediments which hinder sinners from Repentance. Sixthly, I will use motives
and persuasions to bring sinners to repentance.
And of these in their order, as I have propounded them: And first, it shall
be expedient to show what Repentance is.

CHAP. II. Showing what Repentance is.
REpentance is a gift of God, whereby a sinner, 1 What Repentance is.
through the fear of God, is changed in his mind, and turned from sin unto
God.

First, I say, that Repentance is a gift of God: 1 A gift of God.
for so the Scripture makes it. For in the Acts of the Apostles, it is said,
Acts 11. 18.
God has also to the Gentiles granted Repentance unto life. And to Timothy, S.
Paul says, 2 Timothy 2. 25.
If God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the
truth. Here, by Gods granting and giving repentance, it is apparent, that
Repentance is the gift of God.

Next, in the definition of Repentance, there is mentioned 2 The fear of God.
In the first conversion of a sinner, diverse things concur.
the fear of God, moving the sinner to repent. In the act of Repentance, even
in the first conversion of a sinner, there are diverse things concur.

First, there is the gracious working of God, who, by his holy Spirit does
soften the heart of a sinner, and gives him grace to convert, and to turn
from sin unto 1 Gods holy Spirit, by which God gives the sinner grace to
repent.
God.

Secondly, there is the working of that fear, which is called the servile
fear; whereby, a sinner is moved and stirred, is vexed and disquieted in
himself, for fear of punishment; and is even terrefied and affrighted with
the hideous sight of his abominable sins, and the terror 2 Servile fear.
of Gods judgment for sin. when he sees Hell gaping to devour him: which
horrible fear, though in the wicked and reprobate, it be a torment, and able
to bring them to desparation; as it was in Cain and Judas: yet in the children
of God, this legal terror and affrighting of sinners with the fear of
punishment, may be a preparation to receive grace; when as they are truly
humbled for their sins, under the sense and feeling of Gods anger and
displeasure against sin.

Thirdly, the working of Faith; whereby the sinner 3 Faith.
begins to look unto Christ, and believes the remission of his sins, at
the least, believes that his sins are pardonable.

Fourthly, the working of hope; whereby the sinner 4 Hope.
receives hope of the remission of his sin, hoping that through the mercy of
God, and merits of Christ, his sins shall be forgiven.

Fifthly, the working of that fear, which is called the 5 Filial fear.
filial, or childe-like fear; whereby the sinner is now displeased with
himself, in regard of this, that he has offended God, who has been so good
and gracious a God unto him, to spare him so long, giving him so long time and
space of repentence, and offering him mercy in Christ Jesus: and now he
begins to fear God, not so much for fear of punishment, as out of
reverence, awe, and love of God: who has so loved him, as not only to
forbear him in the time of his ignorance and wickedness, when he deserved
rather to have been cut off, and cast from the presence of the Lord into utter
darkness; but has sent his only Son Jesus Christ to be his Savior and
Redeemer, to shed his blood to save his sinful soul; in grateful remembrance
hereof, he is resolved now hence forward, to deny himself, to renounce the
world, to forsake his former sinful course of life, and to turn himself unto
the Lord, to serve him in holiness and righteousness all the days of his life;
and this, because he fears God.

Thirdly, in Repentance, I say, that a sinner is changed 3 Change of mind.
in his mind. There are two words used in the new Testament, which signify
(...), poenitentia, and (...), ^^sipis^entia. B^rn. in Matthew. 3. 2.
Repentance. The former signifies such a Repentance, whereby the sinner is
grieved, and very sorry for the evil which he has done, and no more. And this
may be in the wicked and reprobate; for of Judas it is said, (...). Mat. 27. 3.
he repented himself, that is, he was sorry and grieved, he was vexed and
disquited within himself, that he had done so wicked a deed, as to betray
his Master; he could have wished it undone: but thi^ was all The other word used
for Repentance, properly signifies a change of the mind: and it is such a
Repentance, whereby a sinner is not only sorry, and grieved, for the evil
which he has done, but is so sorry for what is past, as that he is more wise
ever after, to avoid sin, and so sorry for the wickedness committed, that he
redresseth his ways, and amendeth his life. This word is used by S. Peter in
his Sermon to the Jews, after that they had crucified Christ: for exhorting
them to repentance, he says, (...). Acts 3. 19.
Repent ye therefore, and be converted. This repentance is proper to the
children of God.

Lastly, in Repentance, there is a turning from sin, 4 Turning from sin to
God.
and a turning unto God. But of this, more in the next place.

Now, whereas Repentance is, (as has been proved) Against those, who think
that they can repent when they pleaso.
to reprove the great security of many concerning their conversion and turning
unto God: many think its an easy thing to leave sin; they hold that
repentance is in their own power; and are vainly persuaded, that they can
repent when they please. But consider, I beseech you, o ye secure and
careless people; know ye, and consider well with your selves, that repentance
is not in any man's power, no man can repent when he will: for Repentance is
the gift of God, and it is of the gracious working of Gods Holy Spirit, that a
sinner is changed in mind, and turned from sin, unto God. Wherefore in
Jeremy, Ephraim is brought in lamenting, and praying, Ier. 31. 18.
Turn thou me, and I shall be turned. And the Jews in their affliction,
pray, Lam. 5. 21.
Turn thou us unto thee, o Lord, and we shall be turned. The Spouse of Christ
says unto him, Cant. 1. 4.
Draw me, we will run after thee. When Christ called the two Disciples, he
said unto them* Mat 4. 19, 20.
Follow me, and they followed him. To the end that we may be turned unto God,
from our evil way; it is God that must turn us; that we may follow Christ,
Christ must first call us, and bid us follow him. And that we may run after
Christ. its he, that by his grace and good Spirit, must draw us unto him.

If it be objected, that the Lord, by his Prophets Zach. 1. 3.
Turn ye unto me: and Joel 2. 12, 13.
Turn unto the Lord your God.

The answer is twofold:

First, in these and such like sayings, the Lord does

Secondly, though a sinner in his very first conversion Phil. 2. 13.
It is God that works in you, both to will, and to do of his good pleasure.

CHAP. III. Of the parts of Repentance.
Having showed what Repentance is: now follow 1 The parts of Repentance: two.
the parts thereof, and they are two. The one is a turning from sin, the
other, a returning unto God: usually called by Pola. Buca. Vrsin.
Divines, Mortification, and Vivification.

Mortification is a work of the Spirit, whereby a sinner 1 Mortification. What
it is.
does so turn from sin, as that he does not only wail his sins past, and
is out of love with sin, yea, hates and abhors sin; but does mortify
his inward corruptions, does give sin a deadly wound, yea, kilssinne, and
dies to sin; so that sin has no more rule and dominion over him, neither
is he any longer the servant of sin. This is the first part of Repentance.

The second is Vivification, or a quickening of the new 2 Vivification. What it
is.
man; which is a work of the Spirit, whereby a sinner is so turned from sin
unto God, as that he is quickened by the Spirit of God, to lead a new life; he
is raised from the death of sin, to the life of righteousness; and
henceforward gives himself unto God, to serve and please him in newness of
life. These two parts of Repentance are set down in the Scriptures. David
says, Psalm. 37. 27.
Depart from evil, and do good. Esaias says, Isa. 55. 7.
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let
him return unto the Lord. So in the Acts of the Apostles, the Lord said unto
Paul, Acts 26. 18.
I send thee to the Gentiles, to open their eyes, and to turn from darkness
to light, and from the power of Satan to God. And to the practice of both these
parts of repentance, the Scripture does further exhort, and persuade in
particular: To the former, thus: Esaias says, Jsa. 1. 1. 16.
Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine
eyes, cease to do evil. Ezekiel says, Ezekiel. 18. 21.
If the wicked will turn from all the sins that he has committed. S. Paul
says, Coloss. 3. 5.
Mortify your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness,
inordinate affections, evil concupiscence, and covetousness which is
Idolatry. And to the other part of Repentance, to turn unto the Lord, the
Scriptures are plentiful in exhorting, By Jeremy the Lord says, Ierem. 4. 1.
If thou will return, o Israel, says the Lord, return unto me. The Prophet
Joel says, Joel 2. 12, 13.
Therefore now, says the Lord, turn ye unto me. And again, Turn ye unto
the Lord your God. The Prophet Hosea says, Hos. 14. 1.
O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God, for thou have fallen by thine
iniquity. Thus are we exhorted to Repentance, in both the parts thereof.

Now, whereas Repentance consists of these two

First, those who are so far from true repentance, 1 Against those, who turn
from no sin.
that they have not attained to the first part of Repentance, to turn from
sin: for some there are, which turn from no sin, but still live in their
old sins; some in blindness and ignorance, in idolatry and superstition, and
turn not; they will not be converted, nor turned from darkness to light.
Others, live in sinfulness and wickedness; as, some in whoredom and
uncleanness, some in drunkenness, some in maliciousness, some in swearing,
cursing, lying, etc. such they have been, and such they are still: there is no
change of mind, no turning: these are far from repentance, because they are
not yet turned from their sins.

Secondly, whereas Repentance is not only a turning 2 Against those, who turn
from one sin to another.
from sin, but also a turning unto God; this reprooues those, who in turning
from sin, so turn themselves, as that they turn not from sin to God, but
turn from one sin to another; and oft-times to the contrary evil. These
leap out of one vice into another; and run from one St^l^idum v^^an^ vi^ia, in
c^ntra^^^ cur^i^it.
extreme to another, as evil, or worse then the former. As when a man turns
from prodigality to coue^ousnesse: when, of a prodigal waster and mis-spender
of his own goods and substance; coming to himself, and resolving to leave
that course of life, and to live a more frugall and sparing life; heeleapes
over the mean, Liberality; and falls into the extreme vice of covetousness.
Hence comes oppression, extremeracking, wringing and wronging of the poor:
before, such an one undid himself; now, he undoes others. Such are they also
in these days, who are so far out of love with popish fasting, that they
fast not at all: think so evil of popish giving of alms, that they
themselves are waxen cold in charity: and are such enemies to popish mumbling
up of prayers in an unknown language, that in the mean time, their own
devotion is cold: yea, some so abhor idols, that they are fallen into the
other extreme, to commit sacrilege, so that it may be said unto them, as the
Apostle says, Romans 2. 22.
thou that abhorrest idols, do thou commit sacrilege?

Thirdly, this also reproues those who do not turn 3 Against those who turn
to sin again.
from sin, to God; but after that they have made some outward, fained,
hypocritical show of repentance, and seemed to be washed from their
filthiness; turn to sin, yea, to the same sin again. This is to be like
Pharaoh; who, when the devouring Locusts were in the land, confessed and said,
Exodus 10. 16.
I have sinned against the Lord: but no sooner was the judgment removed, but
his Exodus 20.
heart was hardened, and he sinned again. Like to backsliding Israel, of whom
the Pas^mist says, Psalm. 78. 34. 35. 36. 37.
When he show them, then they sought him, and they returned, and inquired early
after God, etc. nevertheless, they did flatter him with their mouth and they
lied unto him with their tongues; for their heart was not right with him. Thus
Sea men, on the land drink excessiuely, but being on the sea in the midst of a
mighty storm, cry unto God, and seem to be holy: but the storm being past,
and they now arrived at the Haven where they would be, fall to their old
custom of drinking again. Those that return to the same sin again, S. Peter
compares to the dog, and to the swine; 2. Pet. 2. 22.
It is happened unto them according to the true Proverb; The dog is turned
to his own vomit again, and the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the
mire. Isa. 1. 16.
Wash you, make you clean, says the Prophet Esaias; some sinners wash and are
clean, some again wash, but are not clean: Lauatur and mundus est, qui
praeterita plangit and slenda it^rum non comm^^i^: lauatur and non est mundus,
qui pl^ngit qua gessi^ nec deseri^, and post lachrymas, ea quae dest^uerit,
repe^it. Mag. sent. l. 4. d. 14. cap. 1.
he is washed and made clean, as one says, who mournes and laments for his
sins past, and does not afterward commit sins to be lamented and wept for:
and that sinner is washed, but is not clean, who mourns and sorroweth for
his sins which he has committed, but yet does not leave nor forsake them,
but falls again into the same sins which he had formerly lamented. And Inanis
est poenitentia, quam sequen^ culpa coinquinat. Aug. Soliloq.
that repentance, as one again says, is but vain, which is defiled again
with after-sinnes. But let all such know that their case is dangerous, except
they be converted and turned from their sins after a better manner; by
returning unto the Lord, forsaking their evil ways, and resolving to lead a
new life. For as Saint Peter says, 2. Pet. 2. 20.
If after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge
of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and
overcome, the latter and is worse with them then the beginning.

CHAP. IIII. Of the manner how a Sinner may truly repent; showing what things
are necessarily required to true, and sound repentance; and first, of the
knowledge of Sin.
HItherto of the parts of Repentance: The third thing in the Treatise of
Repentance, is concerning 3 How a sinner may truly repent: and what things are
required thereunto.
the manner how a Sinner may truly repent; and of the things necessarily
required to true, and sound Repentance.

Prou. 15. 24.
The way of life, says Solamon, is above to the wise, that he may depart from
hell beneath. Heaven is above, hell is beneath: all men on earth are traveling
toward one of these two places: either heaven above, or hell beneath: the way
that leads to hell is a Mat. 7. 13. 14
broad way, and has a wide gate; but the way to heaven is a narrow way, and
has a strait gate, as our Savior has said: the way to hell, is all Facilis
est descensus auerni.
descending; and therefore more easy to fall into it: but the way to heaven is
all ascending, and therefore the harder to approach unto. Now, in both ways,
there are steps and degrees: In the way that tends toward hell, there are
six steps and degrees, by which the Six steps going down to hell.
sinner does descend, and goes still more and more downward toward the pit of
hell: and they are observed to be these.

The first, is an enticing of the heart to a liking of sin, 1 An enticing of
the heart ^o a liking of sin, and a voluntary delight therein.
suggested by Satan; with a voluntary delight in the same. For first, Satan
puts an evil thought into the mind of man, and tempts the sinner to do
evil: and though the sinner do not presently give full consent of heart to
do that wickedness suggested, yet his heart is enticed and drawn toward it,
to approve and like well of it; yea, to delight in it: of this St James says
thus, Iam. 1. 14.
every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.

The second, is a consent unto sin with the heart. 2 The hearts consenting
unto sin.
In the former, the heart did but approve, and allow of the temptation, and at
the most, but delight, and please it self in it: but here, the heart given
full consent to practice, and put in execution the wickedness which Satan
has suggested.

The third, is the doing of evil: the actual committing 3 Doing of evil.
of sin: that which S. James calls the Iam. 1. 15.
bringing forth of sin.

The fourth, is continuance in evil doing. 4 Continuance in evil.


The fifth, is custom in sinning: when a sinner has so long continued in the
practice of any sin, that now it is a usual thing with him: its grown to a
custom with 5 Custom in sinning.
him and therefore can hardly leave it.

The sixth, is obstinacy in sin: when a sinner is grown 6 Obstinacy in
sin.
to a hardness of heart, so that he is obstinate and wilful in sinning, when
as he does obstinately continue in ^in, having an impenitent heart, and will
not be reformed.

When a sinner has ^^^den these six steps, he has gone so far in the
bro^^ way that leads to dest^uction, that he is now near to the gates of
death, at the very brim of the bottomless pit, and cannot possibly escape
destruction, even the destruction and overthrow of soul and body
everlastingly, in the pit of hell, except he return. Now, the returning of a
sinner from the gates of death, must not be by the same way: but with the
wisemen of the East, he must return Mat. 2. 12.
another way, and must ascend up to the high mountain of Heaven by these six
steps and degrees: Six steps and degrees whereby a sinner ascends to Heaven.
Or


The first, is a knowledge and sight of his own sins. The second, is godly
sorrow for sin. The third, is humble confession, and acknowledgement of his
sins. The fourth, is the forsaking of his sins. The fifth, is reformation of
life. The sixth, is perseverance in grace, and goodness.
These six, are like the six steps, whereby 1. Kin. 10. 18. 19.
Solamon ascended to his iuory Throne: by these six steps, knowledge of sin,
godly sorrow for sin, confession of sin, forsaking sin, reformation of
life, and perseverance in grace, and goodness; a sinner that has gone astray,
returns, and ascends to the glorious throne of the king of heaven: for when a
sinner has trodden the first step of grace, being come to the knowledge of his
sins, and from the knowledge of his sins, come to godly sorrow for his
sins, from godly sorrow, to confession of his sins, from confession, to the
forsaking of his sins, and after the forsaking of his sins, being come to
reformation of life; there remains then but one other step to bring him to
heaven: namely, perseverance in grace, and goodness, continuing in well-doing:
for Mat. 24. 13. Six things required to true Repentance.
he that endures to the end shall be saved. So then, there are six things
necessarily required to true, and sound repentance; without which, a sinner
cannot be saved.

The first, is the knowledge of sin. 1 The knowledge of sin.


In the knowledge of sin, two things are necessary to be considered;

First, what knowledge of sin is required: Wherein, two things.
Secondly, how a sinner may come to the true knowledge of his sins.
Touching the first. The knowledge of sin is twofold, 1 What knowledge of
sin is required. Knowledge of sin twofold.


General, and

Particular.

The general knowledge of sin, is, to know sin to be the transgression of
the law; that he that sins, and 1 General knowledge of sin.
does wickedly, breaks Gods commandments; to know, that swearing, and
cursing, and lying, and slandering, that murder, and adultery, that
drunkenness, and pride, and maliciousness, etc. are transgressions of Gods
commandments; and to know that they that do such things are in danger of Gods
judgment: this is a knowledge of sin, but this is only a general
knowledge: this may be in the wicked and ungodly, who come short of true
repentance.

But there is a particular knowledge of sin; and that 2 Particular knowledge of
sin. Twofold. To know our sins
stands in two things; To know our sins, first, which they are.

Secondly, what manner of ones they are.

Touching the first: To know our sins, which they are, is necessary: and
although it be hard for a man to know and remember at any one time, all the
sins that 1 Which they are.
he has done all his life time; to call to mind, how, and in what particular
he has broken the commandments of God, either by thought, word, or deed:
and to remember all his secret faults; though this, I say, be difficult, and a
hard labor: yet its necessary, for every one, as much as possibly he may; to
know, and find out his own particular sins, how he has offended God, or
wronged man; that a sinner may say with David, Psalm. 51. 3.
I acknowledge my transgressions: before a sinner can with David, come to an
humble acknowledgement, and confession of his sins, he must needs have first a
knowledge of his particular sins, know his sins whereby he has offended.
Before David confessed his sin of adultery with Bathsheba, saying 2. Sam.
12. 13.
I have sinned against the Lord: the Prophet of the Lord had opened his eyes,
that he might both see, and know his sin: he had first the knowledge of
sin, before he was brought to acknowledge and confess his sin. So the
Jews confessing their sins, say, Isa. 59. 12.
our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against
us, for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities we know them.
And if a sinner cannot come to the knowledge of all his sins; but some
remain secret, and unknown unto him; for his unknown sins, he must pray
with David, Psa. 19. 12.
cleanse thou me from secret faults. Our sins must first be found out, that
we may see them, and know which they are.

Secondly, we must also know what manner of ones 2 What manner of ones they are.
they are: and to that end, we must view them a priori and a p^steriori. We
must take knowledge of our sins.
before and behind: consider their beginning and their end. In aword, we must
know them.

First, by their cause: Secondly by their effects: Thirdly, by their adjuncts.
First, by their cause: The cause of sin, is partly from 1 By the cause thereof.
Satan, through his subtle suggestion: and partly of our selves, through our
own lust and concupiscence: of both which, S. James speaks thus Iam. 1. 14.
15.
Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and entised.
Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin. where the Devil is
made the Father of sin, and our own lust and concupiscence, the mother of
sin: here is the procreating cause of sin: here is the generation, and
breed of sin.

Secondly, by the effects of sin: which are two.

Shame, and 2 By the effects of sin. Two.


Death.

The first is shame: noted in those words of the Apostle to the Romans, Romans
6. 21.
What fruit had ye then in those things, 1 Shame.
whereof ye are now ashamed? there is the shame of sin: sin goes before,
and shame follows after

The Second is death: yea, eternal death; malediction, 2 Death.
yea, hell and condemnation without repentance. Of this, S. Paul also says,
ver. 21.
the end of those things is Death. again he says ver. 23.
the wages of sin is death and S. James says; Iam. 1. 15.
sin when it is finished, brings forth Death.

Thirdly, by the adjuncts of sin: which are three. 3 By the adjuncts of
sin. Three.


First, foul: Secondly, great: Thirdly, many.
Our sins are First, foul: S. James says: Iam, 1. 15.
When lust 1 Foul.
has conceived it brings forth sin: but sin being brought forth, is very
foul, and ugly to look upon; a misshapen thing, a filthy leper, there is
nothing in the world so foul to look upon, as this child of wickedness.
Consider it in some particulars; murder is a bloody sin; the murtherer's
hands are full of blood. Fornication and adultery are filthy sins; called
Ephesians, 5. 3.
v^cleannes. Drunkenness is a very beast like, swinish sin: what a filthy
sight is it to see a man made in the Image of God; vomiting like a dog?
tumbling in the dirt, and wallowing in the mire like a swine? we find in the
law, that there were diverse washings and purifiings, to wash and cleanse the
offenders: signifiing thereby, that sin is a most filthy thing; and that the
soul stained with sin, has need of much washing.

Secondly, our sins are great; and that in a twofold 2 Great.
respect. first, comparing one sin, with another: secondly, in their own
nature: for they are committed against God, who is great in power, and infinite.

Thirdly, our sins are many: they exceed in multitude, 3 Many.
they are innumerable. Insomuch that David says, Psalm. 19. 12.
who can understand his errors? and again, Psalm. 40. 12.
they are mothen the hairs of my head. Manasseh in his prayer counting the
number of his sins, finds them so greatly to exceed, that he says. They
are above the number of the sands of the sea.

Hereby it may appear, what manner of knowledge of sin, is required of every
penitent sinner.

The Second thing concerning the knowledge of sin; How a sinner may come to the
knowledge of his sins. Namely, by the law.
is, how a sinner may come to the knowledge of his sins. S. Paul. shows, that
the knowledge of sin is by the Law. Romans 3. 20.
By the law is the knowledge of sin. The law of God, even the Moral law,
written in the two tables of ston^, is the means to find out our sins: the
law of God will let us see our original sin, by making us see and know our
corruption of nature, our evil inclinations, and evil dispositions against
the law of God. Of which S. Paul speaks thus, Romans 7. 7.
I had not known sin but by the law, for I had not known lust, except the
law had said, thou shall not covet. The law also will let us see and know our
actual transgressions, whether they be committed by thought, word, or deed;
against any commandment by the law of God we may see and know our evil
thoughts against God, and against our neighbor: our lustful thoughts, our
covetous thoughts, our carnal and worldly thoughts: our blasphemous words, and
slanderous speeches; and all our sinful and wicked deeds. Yea what evil we
have committed, or what good we have omitted. For this cause, the Law of God is
compared to a looking-glass; for, as a man beholding his face in a glass, may
see and perceive the spots and blemishes that are therein; so a sinner, looking
into the law of God, and diligently perusing the Commandments, may find out
and evidently perceive the spots and blemishe^ of his soul. Thus a sinner
comes to the knowledge of his sins.

Now, whereas there is necessarily required such a particular To know our
selves.
sin comes by the law; the consideration hereof, is first profitable for
instruction; to teach us to know our selves. This has been always held a
good precept amongst wise men, know thy self. Its good and profitable for
every (...).
one to know himself, to search and try his own heart, and by diligent
inquiry, to find out his own particular sins; to know his own weakness,
and wickedness, his sins, and his misery. David's exhorta^ion is, Psalm. 4 4.
commune with your own heart upon your bed. Enter into your closet, yea, into
the secret chamber of your own heart, there, begin to think, with your
selves; there, speak unto your selves; there, confer, and reason about the
spiritual state, not of others, but of your own selves.

well look into himself, he might find matter enough to humble, yea, to
contemn himself, in regard of any goodness, or worthiness that is in
himself: and that whether we regard the body, or the soul of man.

In regard of the body; what is man but earth? a vessel of corruption? dust
and ashes? wormes-meat? yea, a sinful, polluted body? And for the soul, now
in the corrupt state, infected, and polluted with sin, till we be renewed by
the Spirit of God, till God come unto us, to cleanse, and purify, and
sanctify us with his renewing grace; what are we, but as the Scripture calls
us, Romans 5. Ver. 6. 8. 10.
ungodly, sinners, enemies of God; Ephe. 2. 13.

we are R^u. 3. 17.
wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. Besides all this, in
danger of the Gal. 3. 10.
malediction and curse of God, in danger of hell and condemnation: and that
which augmenteth our misery, and wretched state, is, that we are the cause of
our own misery; and are no way able to help our selves out of our misery,
either to purge our selves from our sins, or to free our selves from the
danger o^ condemnation, and eternal death: so that a sinner coming to this
humble acknowledgement of himself, in regard of his own spiritual state, and
considering seriously, what he has been, and what he is, may cry out, and
say with St Paul, Rom 7. 24.
O wretched man that I am; who shall deliver me?

proud Pharisie, Luke 18. 11.

Publicane.

Secondly, except we search out our own sins, and 2 To cause us to seek

come truly to know our own selves, we cannot be brought to seek to the
Lord for grace and mercy: for a man that knows not his wants, seeks not
for help, and redress of his wants.

Secondly, the consideration of the knowledge of sin, and that in particular
manner, as has been formerly Against those who have no sense or feeling of
sin.
searching their hearts to find out, and know their sins, that they have
little or no sense and feeling of their sins. Though they know, and confess
themselves in a general manner, to be sinners, as others are; yet they do not
come to a particular knowledge of their sins, to know the greatness of their
sins, the multitude and foulness of their sins; and to know the danger
that their souls are in, by reason of their sins. Though they be sinners,
yet their sins never trouble them, their sins are no burden unto them: they
lie under the heavy weight and burden of sin, and yet feel no pain. The
reason is, because they are yet in ignorance and blindness, they are not
enlightened with the knowledge of the truth, to know God, and to know
themselves: the eyes of their mind are not enlightened, truly to see, and know
their particular sins; but ^phe. 4 18. 19
having as the Apostle says, the understanding darkened, being alienated from
the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because of the
blindness of their heart; who being past feeling, have given themselves over
unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. These have
benumbed, and dead consciences, yea, these have as the Apostle also says, 1 Timothy 4. 2.
their conscience seared with a hot iron. This is a very dangerous state, when
a sinner is so far from the knowledge of his sins, as that he has no
feeling of his sins: no remorse, nor true touch of conscience for all the
evil that he has done. But to the end that a sinner may truly repent him of
his sins, and be saved, its necessary that he have, as much as possibly he
can, a particular knowledge of his sins, to know which they are, and what
manner of ones they are; how great, how grievous, how heinous and how dangerous
they be. And that he have also a feeling of the heavy weight and burden of
sin. For, a^ a man carrying a heavy and weighty burden, too heavy for him
to bear, is not like to be eased of his burden, till he complain of the
weight, and call for help, and then some friend or neighbor eases his
shoulder; so a sinner, that is heavy laden with the burden of sin, is like
to find no ease, till he have a feeling of the heavy weight and burden of
sin, lying heavy upon his soul. For Christ calls only such sinners to
come unto him. Mat. 11. 28.
Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest. And as a sick-man sore diseased, is not like to find ease, till having a
feeling of his pain, he complain of his grief, and lets the Physician know
where his pain lies; so a sinner that is sick by reason of sin, and has a
diseased soul, except he have a feeling of his spiritual infirmity, how can
he be healed? Mat. 9. 12.
They that be whole need not a Physician says our Savior, but they that are
sick. Christ is the true, and best Physician of the soul; every sinner is a
sick man, sick in soul, and has need of Christ's Physic to cure and heal
him. Now, if any one think himself sound and whole enough in soul, and feel
no sin trouble him, and therefore make no have to go and seek to Christ
Jesus the good Physician, how can that man's soul be healed? That man who in
the judgment of the learned Physician, is sore sick, and diseased, and yet
feels little or no pain; is most dangerously sick: so that sinner, who has
a sinful soul, sore diseased with sin, and yet has little or no feeling of
sin, no true knowledge of his sins, is in greatest danger of his soul. When
the Israelites felt themselves stung with N^m. 21. 6. 7. 8. 9.
fiery serpents in the Wilderness, their remedy was to look up to the
serpent of brass: and if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the
serpent of brass, he lived. This brazen serpent was a type and figure of
Christ; who was lift up for our Redemption. Of which, our Savior Christ
himself says, Ioh. 3. 14. 15.
As Moses lift up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son
of man be lift up, that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have
eternal life. But as those Israelites only had benefit by the brazen serpent,
which felt themselves stung, and then looked up to the brazen serpent; so they
only have benefit by Christ, who having a feeling of sin, feeling their
souls inwardly slung with the fiery darts of the old serpent, the Devil; do
run, and fly apace to Christ Jesus for help, by the eye of faith, looking
up unto Jesus, that so their wounded souls may be healed.

CHAP. V. Of godly sorrow: and first, of Contrition, or inwar^ sorrow for sin.
AFter the knowledge of sin, follows godly 2 Godly sorrow.
sorrow for sin: This is the second step and degree in the repentance of a
sinner. 2 Cor. 7. 10.
God^y sorrow (says S. Paul) works repentance to salvation, not to be
repented of. Here, S. Paul makes godly sorrow a thing necessarily required to
repentance, without which a sinner cannot be saved. That sorrow which Sorrow
for sin. Twofold.
works repentance, the Apostle calls Godly sorrow: for there are two sorts of
sorrow for sin.

The one, Buca. de poenitent.
Legal.
The other, Evangelical.
The Legal sorrow for sin, is that sorrow which arises 1 Legal.
from the Law of God, and the terror of a man's own conscience: whereby a
sinner is sorry, and grieved for the evil which he has committed, only in
regard of the wrath of God, and the punishment which he sees to be deservedly
due unto him, and hanging over his head. This is that sorrow, which the Apostle
calls 2 Cor. 7. 10.
the sorrow of the world, or worldly sorrow, which works death. Godly sorrow
works repentance, but worldly sorrow works death: for a sinner being
detected, and his wickedness found out; the Law of God having laid open his
sin, and wounded his conscience, he stands as one terrified with the
remembrance of his deserved punishment: now his conscience witnesses against
him, that he has done wickedly, that he deserves punishment, and cannot
escape the judgment of God. And many in this agony, being not able to deliver
themselves, and their souls refusing comfort, are swallowed up with abundance
of worldly sorrow, and without the great mercy of God, are plunged into the
gulf of despair.

But there is also an Evangelical sorrow for sin: 2 Evangelical. Twofold.
which is properly, Godly sorrow: and this is twofold.

Inward, and

Outward.

Inward sorrow for sin, is called Contrition: Outward, is mourning,
lamenting, and weeping for sin.

First, of Contrition, or inward sorrow for sin. In 1 Contrition, or inward
sorrow for sin.
handling whereof, I will show,

First, what Contrition is. Secondly, how it is wrought in us. Thirdly, the
signs and marks of it. Fourthly, the motives to persuade unto it.
For the first: Contrition, or inward sorrow for sin, 1 What Contrition is.
is a sorrow of the heart, specially for this, that a sinner has offended God:
and being truly humbled, with a sense and feeling of his sins, is displeased
with himself for his sins, and does now not only dislike, but from his
heart detest and abhor sin. This is properly called (...).
sorrow according to God, or sorrow after a godly sort, and godly sorrow; and
sorrow to repentance. It is called (...). 2 Cor. 7. 9, 10.
compunction of heart. It is also called the Acts 2. 37.
renting of the heart. And it is called a Joel 2. 17.
broken spirit, Psalm. 51. 17.
a broken and a contrite heart.

For the second: How Contrition is wrought in a sinner; The means whereby a
sinner is brought to Contrition, 2 How Contrition is wrought in a sinner.
and inward hearty sorrow for his sins are two.

The one, is the gracious working of the Spirit of God: giving a sinner a
lively sense and feeling of his sins; giving him grace to see and know how by
his 1 By the working of the Spirit of God.
sins he has offended God, and grieved the Holy Spirit of God, so^ming also
his hard heart, that he may grieve, lament, and mourn for his sins after a
godly manner. This is that which the Lord says by his Prophet Zachary, Zach.
12. 10.
I will power upon the house of David, and upon the Inhabitants of Jerusalem,
the spirit of grace and of supplications, and they shall look upon me whom
they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only
son. A sinner looking upon Christ, whom by his sins he has pierced and
wounded, and having a true feeling of his sins, greeueth and mourns, he is
sorry after a godly manner: but how is this godly forrow wrought in him? the
Lord says, that he will power the spirit of grace, and of supplications, upon
the sinful soul; and when the Lord has put such grace into the soul of a
sinner, to see his sins, and to perceive, how that by his sins he has
offended God, and pierced the Son of God; then he is inwardly grieved at the
heart, then his heart melts into tears. This is the first means whereby a
sinner is brought to Contrition.

The second means, is the preaching of Christ crucified: 2 By preaching Christ
crucisied.
as appears in the example of those first Conuerts, to whom Peter preached
Christ crucified. For having testified against them, that they had crucified
Christ, Acts 2. 37, 38.
They were pricked in their hearts, and said unto Peter, and the rest of the
Apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? their consciences were so
stricken with the terror of this, that they should be guilty of shedding the
innocent blood of the Son of God, that they were at their wits end, they knew
not what to do; yet were they desirous to find ease to their troubled
consciences, but knew not how, till they called to remembrance the words of the
Apostle, how that Jesus of Nazareth whom they had crucified and slain, was the
Son of God, whom God raised up, who ascended to Heaven, and is exalted at the
right hand of God: and hearing also, that he is Jesus the Savior, that he is
the true Messiah, Christ, the Anointed of the Lord; hereupon they are pricked
in their hearts, and touched in their consciences, with a feeling of their
sins; yet so, as they do not despair of all mercy, but trusting in the
goodness and mercy of God through Christ, and being desirous to know how they
may find comfort to their troubled consciences, they said to Peter and to the
rest of the Apostles, Menand brethen, what shall we do? o teach us, what we
must do to be saved. Now, they are sorrowful after a godly manner; now, they
are of a contrite spirit, and an humble soul; now, they are exceeding
sorrowful, that they have crucified the Lord of life; now, they have bleeding
hearts, for that they have shed the blood of the innocent Lamb of God; now,
they are exceedingly displeased with themselves, for that they have done so
wickedly; and now, they so abhor their sins and wickedness, that they
purpose never to do wickedly again. So that their compunction was not only a
bare pricking of the heart, such as Cain and Judas had; but as they had a
feeling of their sins, so also had they a feeling of the mercy of God in
Christ Jesus. Moreover, to the compunction and pricking of their hearts, there
was joined a readiness to obey the will of God, and to do whatsoever the Lord
should command them; and therefore it is, that they say, Men and brethren, what
shall we do? to the end that a sinner may be brought to Contrition; its
necessary, that the Word of God, which is Heb. 4. 12.
quick and powerful, and sharper then any two-edged sword, piercing even to
the dividing a sunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is
a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; do pierce the heart, and
wound the conscience, making the sinner to feel his sins, to know, that by
his sins he has offended God, who has been so gracious a God, and so
loving and merciful a Father unto him; and to acknowledge, that by his sins,
he has pierced and wounded the Son of God, who was content to be pierced and
wounded, yea, and to suffer his blood to be shed for his sins. The Adamant,
the hardest stone, which will neither be bruized with iron, nor melted with
fire, is notwithstanding dissolved with Gemin. lib. 2. cap. 26.
Goats-bloud. What heart is there so hard and stony, so adamant-like, that will
not be mollified and softened, that will not be rent and broken, yea, dissolved
into tears, being washed and soaked in the blood of Christ? this, o man, this
must, or nothing will soften thy hard heart. Thus Contrition is wrought in the
heart.

The third thing, is concerning the signs and marks 3 Signs of contrition, or
inward godly sorrow.
of Contrition.

Contrition, or inward godly sorrow, is known by the Effects thereof, namely,
such things as it works in us: and they are seven; mentioned by the Apostle
to the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 7. 11.
For behold, this self same thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what
carfulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of your selves, yea, what
indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea,
what revenge?

The first effect of godly sorrow, is carfulness. After 1 Carfulness.
that a sinner has done amiss, and truly repented of his sin, he is ever
after more careful to avoid sin; careful lest he fall into sin any more.
According to that saying of S. Ambrose, Qui poenitet, sol^^^^us est, ne denno
pecc^t. Amb. in 2 Cor. 7.
He that does truly repent, is very careful that he offend not again.

The second, is clearing our selves. When a sinner makes 2 Clearing our selves.
an (...).
Apology and Defense for himself: which apologic and defense of himself,
stands not in the defending of himself in his sin; nor in the excusing of
his sin, nor in shifting off his sin from himself; (that's far from him
now) but in the humble acknowledgement and confession of his sin, with
fervent prayer, and earnest suite unto Almighty God, for the pardon of his
sin, that so he may be acquitted, and cleared from his sin.

The third, is Indignation against our sins; yea, a displeasure 3 Indignation.
against our selves for our sins.

The fourth, is Fear. Henceforward to fear the 4 Fear.
Lord; to stand in awe of God, to set the fear of God before our eyes; and to
be afraid of sinning any more, for fear of offending God. As a loving wife
having offended her husband, and being now reconciled unto him again, is ever
after more fearful of offending and greeuing him, lest she should lose his
favor again. 5 Desire.


The fifth, is a vehement desire to serve and please God. Desiderat reformari
se, qui se scit factum perpeccatum deformem. Amb.
A sinner knowing how foul he is, and deformed, by reason of sin, desires
to be reformed. And therefore has now, an earnest desire after God, a desire
to do the will of God, and to walk in the ways of God.

The sixth, is Zeal. To be zealous in good works; Zeal.
zealous in good things; and zealous to provoke others to do good. Being
converted our selves, to strengthen our brethren; in a word, to be zealous in
all things that concern the glory of God.

The seventh, is Revenge. When a sinner so hates 7 Revenge.
sin, as some hate their very enemies: so to hate our sins, as to be
revenged on them. Which Revenge, we take by a voluntary afflicting and
punishing the body. As when any have offended in meats and drinks, to revenge
themselves of their gluttony, of their surfeiting and drunkenness, by
abstinence, and fasting: when any have offended through pride of apparel, to
revenge themselves of their pride, by abating their pride, and betaking
themselves to more plain, more decent, and comely apparel; when any have
offended through filthy lusts, or have defiled their bodies by fornication, or
any uncleanness, to revenge themselves of their filthiness, and uncleanness,
by beating down the body, through fastings, watchings, and paines-taking. An
example of taking such revenge upon our selves for our sins, is that weeping
Saint; who was noted to be a Luke 7. 37. 38.
sinner, a very notorious, sinful, lewd woman. But repenting, she comes to
Christ, and stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet
with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his
feet, and anointed them with the ointment. See what revenge the repenting
sinner now takes upon her self; her eyes, that before were wanton, wandering,
and adulterous eyes; are now so set a weeping, that they trickle down tears
in such abundance, that her tears yield her water sufficient to wash her
Saviors feet. Her hair, so fair and beautiful, which formerly she set
forth as a net to catch her lovers in; now she is so displeased at it, and will
be so avenged on it, that she makes it a towell to wipe Christ's feet. Her
lips, wherewith before she kissed her wanton lovers, now, therewith she
kisseth Christ's feet. And her costly ointment which before she bestowed upon
her self, to give a sweet perfume to allure her lovers, now she brings to
Christ, and therewith annointeth the feet of Christ. Thus the good woman took
revenge upon her self, for her former sinful life.

Now, follow the motives to persuade to contrition, 4 Motives to contrition, or
inward godly sorrow.
or inward godly sorrow; and they are these.

First, God requires it. So says the Lord by the Prophet Jeremy, I^re. 4. 1.
4.
If thou will return O Israel, says the Lord, return unto me. And it
follows, circumcise your selves to the Lord, and take away the foreskinne of
your heart. More 1 God requires it.
plainly, the Prophet Joel. Joel 2. 13.
rent your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God.

Secondly, All penitent sinners, that have truly repented, and turned unto the
Lord, have had true contrition, 2 All penitent sinners have had it.
and inward godly sorrow, more or less, but all in truth: David had it; he had
a Psalm. 51. 17.
broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart. Paul had it: for after that the
Lord had appeared unto him, and said, Act. 9. 4. 5. 6 9. 11.
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Paul trembled and was astonished; and for
three days space, humbled himself with fasting and prayer. Before this, Paul
persecuted the Church, but now he sorroweth and grieueth for what he had done;
now he humbles himself before the Lord for three days space: and to this
inward humiliation, and sorrow of heart for his sins, he joins fasting and
prayer. The penitent Publicane, had this contrite spirit and broken heart: for
he would not so much as lift up his eyes to Heaven, but Luk 18. 13.
smote upon his breast, saying; God be merciful to me a sinner.

Thirdly, Contrition, or inward goodly sorrow is necessary: 3 Its necessary.
For
for

First, except the heart be truly, and thoroughly humbled for sin, yea, rent,
and broken with godly sorrow, Except the heart be rent, sin still remains in
the heart.
it is evident that sin still remains in the heart. For like as a tree which
is plucked up by the roots, rents and breaks the earth about it: so sin that
sticks fast in the heart of a sinner, and has taken rooting in the heart, when
it is rooted out of the heart by repentance, it cannot choose, but make a rent
and a breach in the heart; it will trouble, and afflict the heart for a season.
And therefore, wheresoever this contrition of heart, this renting and breaking
of the heart with godly sorrow for sin, is not felt, at least in some
measure, there, sin sticks fast in the heart.

Secondly, if any be so tender over themselves, that 2 Except we break our
hearts, God will break us in his wrath.
they will not suffer their hearts to be vexed and disquieted with the
remembrance of their sins, and think it a grievous thing to rent and break
their hearts with godly sorrow for their sins; they may justly fear, least
the time shall come, when the Lord shall Psalm. 2. 5 9.
speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. And
least the Lord will break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces
like a potters vessel.

Fourthly, to move us to Contrition, and inward 4 The benefits of contrition.
godly sorrow, let us consider the benefits that may come unto us thereby.
First, Contrition, or inward sorrow for sin, is a sacrifice acceptable to
God: when we do in 1 It is a sacrifice to God.
secret humble our souls before God, and sit sighing, and groaning, sorrowing,
and grieuing for our sins, when we are laboring to rent and break our
earthly, carnal, fleshly hearts; to root up some great master-sinne, out of
our hearts, we then offer a sacrifice well-pleasing to God: such a sacrifice as
David offered, when he humbled himself for his sins. Psalm. 51. 17.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart O
God, thou will not despise.

Secondly, worldly sorrow and grief may hurt a man, 2 Godly sorrow hurts not.
but godly sorrow hurts not. For 2. Cor. 7. 10.
godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, not to be repented of: but the
sorrow of the world works Death; as says the Apostle: and David says, Psalm.
147. 3.
the Lord heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds.

Thirdly, the renting and breaking of the heart with 3 Sorrowing for sin in
this life will keep us from sorrowing in the life to come.
godly sorrow in this life, is a means to keep us from sorrowing and grieuing
after this life. For after this life, R^u. 21. 4.
there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there
be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. In the Book of
Wisdom, the wicked being in hell in torments, are described by sorrow and
anguish of spirit, when they shall see the righteous whom they despised on
earth, in joy and felicity, and themselves cast into outer darkness. Then
they shall groan for anguish of spirit, and say within themselves: Wis. 5. 4.
5. etc.
We fools accounted his life mad^^sse, and his end to ^e without honor. How
is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the Saints?
therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness
has not shined unto us, and the Sun of righteousness r^se not upon us. We
wearied our selves in the way of wickedness, and destruction; yea, we have
gone through deserts, where there lay no way: but as for the way of the Lord,
we have not known it. What has pride profited us? or what good has riches
with our vaunting brought us? all those things are passed away like a shadow,
etc. They that will not sorrow, nor grieve after a godly manner for their sins
in this life, they that will not rent their hearts, and turn to the Lord,
while they have space for repentance granted them on earth; after death, shall
lie in the place of outer darkness, sighing and sorrowing, grieuing and
groaning, renting and breaking their hearts when it is too late. Blessed then
and happy are they, Against those who break their heart with worldly sorrow;
but have little sorrow of heart for their sins.
for their sins, that they need not sorrow nor grieve after this life.

Now, whereas God requires contrition and inward sorrow for sin; seeing all
penitent sinners have had it, more or less; and seeing that it is so
necessary, and profitable for every sinner, as has been declared: the
consideration hereof serves to reprove those, who, for some wor^dly calami^ie
or loss, are so inwardly vexed and grieved at the heart, that they even break
their heart with sorrow and grief; and yet are little or nothing moved to
sorrow and grief for their sins; they break their hearts with worldly
sorrow, but not with godly sorrow. And yet worldly sorrow is hurtful, and
godly sorrow is necessary and profitable. Be not deceived with the vain and
false opinion of those, who think that this sorrowing for sin, will make a
man Melancholic all the days of his life: not so. For the Lord will Psalm.
147. 3.
heal the broken in heart; and they that Mat. 5. 4.
mou^ne shall be comforted. Yea, godly sorrow brings the best joy, and
soundest comfort. Of worldly joy and mirth, Solomon says, Pro. 14. 13.
the end of that mirth is heaviness. But 2. Cor. 7. 10.
godly sorrow St Paul says works repentance to salvation not to be repented
of. A sinner that has truly repented, and been sorrowful after a godly
manner, shall never repent that he has repented: nor ever be sorry, that he
has bin sorry after a godly sort. For though a sinner, sorrowing and grieuing
for his sins, be in heaviness for a time, yet in the end, the Lord will send
him comfort, and refreshing to his soul: and the end of that sorrow will be
peace, and joy: peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

CHAP. VI. Of Godly sorrow which is outward, in mourning and weeping for sin.
HItherto of Godly sorrow which is inward: 2 Outward sorrow for sin. Therein
two things.
Godly sorrow is also outward: and it stands in outward mourning, lamenting and
weeping for sin. In the handling whereof I will

First, show the manner how a penitent sinner may express his godly sorrow
aright, by outward mourning, lamenting, and weeping.

Secondly, use motives to persuade thereunto.

First, of the manner how a sinner that is sorry after a 1 How a penitent sinner
may rightly mourn for his sins.
godly sort, ought to mourn and weep: and therein I consider four things.

First, for whom we are to mourn and weep. Secondly, for what. Thirdly the
time when. Fourthly, the measure, how much, and how greatly Therein four
things,
a sinner is bound to mourn and weep.
Touching the first: we are to mourn and weep for our selves, and others: for
our own sins, and for all 1 For whom.
the abominations that are done by others.

David wept and mourned not only for his own sins, but also for the sins of
others. So he says, Psalm, 119, 136
Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law. In
Ezekiel, the man clothed with linen, which had the writers inkehorne by his
side, is appointed to Ezech, 9 4.
go through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the
men that sigh, and that cry for all the abominations that were done in the
midst thereof. Giving us to understand, that there were some in the city, which
sighed and mourned for the abominations that were done in the city.

For the second: what we are to mourn and weep 2 For what.
for. That which we are specially to weep for, is sin: In general, we are
to mourn for all our sins great and small: known and unknown; secret and
manifest: In particular, for some one sin, by which we have offended, or do
still more grievously offend God. The Israelites having offended God, by asking
a King, when the Lord God was their King, and being reproved for it by Samuel,
they sorrowed, and lamented, and said to Samuel. 1 Samuel 12 19.
Pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not. For we have
added unto all our sins, this ^uill, to ask us a King. So David with great
feeling of his sins, and with great sorrow and mourning, confesses his
sinne^ to the Lord, and craves mercy, Psalm. 51. 1.
have mercy upon me, O God, etc. Yet is most sorrowful for his heinous, bloody
sin: points that out in particular, and prays against it. ver, 14.
deliver me from blood-guiltinesse o God.

The third thing herein, is the time when we ought chiefly to mourn for our
sins. It is not usual with 3 The time when
men to mourn for their sins, till the hand of God be upon them a^^l^ct^ng
them, visiting, and scourging them for their sins. But the chiefest time of
mourning for sin, is, when we have sinned; that thereby we may prevent the
judgment of God, judging our selves, that we be not judged of the Lord. For as
the Apostle says, 1 Cor. 11. 31. M^roris tempus non tunc est, cum aliquid
p^^imur aduersi, sed cum male operamur. Chrysostom. de provident: l. 3.
If we would judge our selves, we should not be judged g The tim^ of sorrowing
and mourning for sin, is not as a Father says, when we are under the cross,
and suffer adversity; but when we do evil, then it behooues us to mourn for
the evil that we have done. As when a man has committed adultery, murder, or
any other grievous crime, for which 4 The measure of mourning for sin. and
therein these rules are to be observed.
his soul is in danger to be deprived of the kingdom of heaven; then is it a
fit time for him to mourn and sorrow for his sin, that he may be reconciled
to God, and win the favor of God again. When affliction is upon us for our
sins, necessity constrains us to weep and mourn because the affliction
calls our sin to remembrance: 1 Sorrow for sin must be greater then for any
wo^^dly want or loss. For.
but it had been much better for us, to have wept and mourned for the evil of
sin, before the evil of punishment fell upon us for sin.

The fourth thing herein to be considered, is the measure of our outward
mourning, and weeping for sin. 1 Sin is the cause of all evil.
Concerning which, these rules must be observed.

First, that our sorrow for sin be greater then for any wordly want or
temporal loss: for.

First, Sin is the cause of all evil that befalls us in 2 A man may be
saved without riches, but not without repentance.
the course of our life.

Secondly, a man that has want of wordly things, or sustaineth loss in
temporal things, may notwithstanding be saved, and come to life everlasting:
but sin not repented of, is able to cast soul and body into hell.

Thirdly, wordly wealth may be procured, and temporal 3 The soul once lost
cannot be recovered.
losses may be recovered again; but the soul being once lost, cannot be
recovered. The loss of the soul is irrecouerable, and therefore, far
greater cause have we to mourn and weep for our sins, then for any wordly
want, or temporal loss whatsoever.

Secondly, greater sins must have greater sorrow; 2 For great sins we must
have great sorrow.
more mourning and more weeping. David was sorry for his lesser sins, but
was exceedingly sorrowful for his great transgressions. 1 Samuel 24. 5.
David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt; but for his
adultery and bloodshed, he afflicted himself sore; he 2 Samuel 12. 16. and psalm.
51.
fasted and mourned, he lay upon the earth and made great lamentation.

Thirdly, mourning and weeping for sin must have 3 There must be a moderation
in mourning for sin.
it moderation, that it exceed not. As S. Paul speaks in the behalf of that
incestuous Corinthian, whom he had excommunicated, but upon his repentance, had
forgiven; saying, 2 Cor 2. 7.
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many. So
that contrariwise, ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest
perhaps, such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. After this
manner, a sinner expresses his godly sorrow outwardly, by mourning, lamenting
and weeping for his sins.

There remain the motives which may persuade us 2 Motives to mourning and
weeping for sin.
to this Godly sorrow, which is outward in mourning and weeping for sin, and
they are four.

First, God requires it. So says the Prophet Esaias, Isa, 22. 12,
In that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and to 1 God requires
it.
mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackloth. The prophet Joel
also says, Joel, 2. 12.
Therefore now says the Lord, turn ye even unto me with all your heart: and
with weeping and with mourning. S. James says, Iam. 4. 9.
be afflicted and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning,
and your joy to beauinesse.

Secondly, penitent sinners have wept and mourned 2 Penitent sin ners have wept
and mourned ^or their sin^es.
for their sins. David says Psalm, 6 6.
I am weary of my groaning, all the night make I my bed to swime, I water my
couch with my tears That penitent woman mentioned by S. Luke, held by diverse
to be Mary Magdalen, wept so abundantly for her sins, that those two little
fountains, her eyes, yielded her water sufficient to ^uk, 7. 38.
wash her Saviors f^ete. when Peter remembered himself how he had sinned, in
denying his master Christ, he went out, and Luke 22. 62.
Wept ^^tterly, Yea Christ Jesus, the head of the Saints, though he himself
had no sins to lament and weep for; yet he oftentimes wept. Coming to
Jerusalem Luke 19, 41.
he wept over it. At the raising of Lazarus Ioh, 11. 35.
Jesus wept. At his passion he wept sore: for the Apostle says, that Heb, 5. 7.
In the deyes of his flesh, he offered up prayers and supplications with strong
crying and tears F^entem illum frequenter ^nue nias, nu^quam vero ^identem.
Chrysostom. in Math. 2. Hom. 6.
we may often find him weeping as a Father says, but (seldom or) never
laughing. Yet he wept not for himself, and for his own sins, (for 1. Pet.
2. 22.
he did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth) But for us, and for our
sins; to teach us to weep and mourn for our selves, and for our own sins.

Thirdly, to consider the necessity of outward sorrowing 3 The necessity of
mourning for sin.
and mourning for sin.

First, our sins have been the cause of crucifying Christ: as says the
Prophet Esaias: Isa. 53. 5.
He was wounded for our transgressions, 1 In rega^d of our sins which were
the cause of crucifying Christ.
he was bruised for our iniquities. The serious consideration of this, should
move us to lament and mourn; this should cause us to sheede abundance of
tears, to consider the grieuousnesse of our sins, how by them we have
crucified and pierced Christ, and certain it is, the remembrance hereof will
so work with true penitent sinners, that they will break forth into mourning:
as says the Prophet Zachary, Zach. 12. 10.
I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem
the spirit of grace and of supplications, and they shall look upon me whom
they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourns for his only
son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for
his first borne. In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as
the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. and the land shall
mourn every family apart, etc.

Secondly, our eyes convey much evil to the heart, 2 Our eyes convey much
evil to the heart.
and therefore must weep much: as they let in sin, so they must, as much as
they can, let it out. In worldly grief, the heart is eased by weeping: so by
tears shed for sin, the soul is eased.

Thirdly, Sin is the cause of affliction and misery; 3 Sin is the cause of
misery,
the cause of trouble, and calamity that befalls us in the course of our life:
Wherefore, as we mourn and weep for the pain and misery, so ought we much
more to mourn, to lament and weep for sin, which is the cause of our
misery.

Fourthly, consider that now, even in this present life, 4 Either now we must
mourn and weep, or we shall hereafter.
we must mourn and weep for our sins, least we be constrained to mourn,
and weep in that doleful and heavy place of mourning, where there is weeping
and gnashing of teeth. And they that will not now weep and mourn for their
sins, shall hereafter. As our Savior says, Luk 6. 25.
Woe to you that laugh now, for ye shall mourn and weep.

And yet more to persuade us to this godly sorrow, to 4 Benefits of mourning
and weeping for sin.
weep and mourn for our sins: consider the Benefits that come thereby.
Weeping and mourning may weaken, and hurt the body, but it strengthens, and
helps the soul: it may harm the body for a time, but it does the soul good
for ever. And the Benefits thereof are these.

First, outward sorrow for sin, arising from the inward 1 Mourning and
weeping for sin, is a means to obtain mercy.
sorrow of the heart, is a means to obtain mercy with God. It is said of
Hezekiah, that Isa. 38. 3.
he wept sore. But his sore weeping was a means of obtaining mercy and favor
with the Lord. For, praising the Lord, he says, ver. 17.
Thou have cast all my sins behind thy backs. Marie Magdalene weeps and
sheeds tears in abundance, but this her mourning and weeping for her sins,
is a means of obtaining mercy with the Lord; for the Lord says unto her, Luke
7 38. 48.
thy sins are forgiven.

Secondly, Mitig^nt^ram Dei lachrymae.
Tears of grace are a means to pacify Gods 2 A means to pacify Gods anger.
anger against us for our sins, and to turn away his wrath from us. The Lord
by the Prophet Joel says, turn ye even to m^ with all your heart, and with
fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning. And rent your heart and not your
garments; and turn unto the Lord your God: for e Joel 2. 12. 13.
he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and
repents him of the evil. As if he should have said, If you will be sorry
for your sins after a godly sort, and if you will turn to the Lord by
renting the heart, and with fasting and weeping and mourning, then the Lord
will turn away ^is wrath from you, then the Lord will be gracious and
merciful unto you.

Thirdly, tears shed for sin, are not shed in vain; 3 Tears shed for
sin, are pleasing to God, and delightful to the Angels.
but they are respected of the Lord, they are well pleasing both to God. and
Angels: they are acceptable and well pleasing to God; God makes reckoning and
account of them: for though they be shed, yet they are not lost. Psalm. 56. 8.
Put thou my tears into thy bottle, says David. Tears of grace, and not as
water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again, but the Lord
has a vessel to receive the tears that we sheede for our sins, not one of
them i^ lost. This heavenly dew of devotion never falls, but the Sun of
righteousness draws it up. And the tear, of penitent sinners are delightful
to the Angels, who rejoice at the conversion of a sinner. Insomuch that the
devout Father calls the L^chrym^ p^^nitentium, Angel^rum. vinum. Bern.
tears of penitent sinners, the Angels wine.

Fourthly, they that mourn and weep for sin, though they have sorrow and
heaviness for a time, in the end shall be comforted: their sorrow shall be
turned 4 They that mourn shall be comforted.
into joy. Christ is sent as says the Prophet Esaias, to Isa. 61. 2. 3.
comfort all that mourn: to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy
for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. And
Christ when he was come, says, M^^ 5. ^.
Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. (...). ^. 6. 5.
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy; says the Psalmist. They, that now
weep and sheede tears for sin, shall hereafter be truly comforted. For Re^.
21. 4.
God shall wipe away a^l tears from their eyes. As after much rain, and great
storms, the heavens wa^e clear, the air is more mild, and the Sun breaks
forth comfortably to refresh the things that are upon the earth; so, after much
weeping, mourning, and sorrowing for sin, the Sun of righteousness breaks
forth, and shines comfortablie upon the sinner, rejoicing the heart, and
greatly refreshing the soul. After a storm, a calm.

A question here arises, concerning outward mourning Whether weeping for sin
be of absolute necesitie?
of tears be simply necessary in godly sorrow? I answer, Per. cas. of
Cons^^. 1. bo^ke. Chap. 5.
Weeping for sin is required, and is commend^ble in whomsoever it is, if it
be in truth. Yet corporal weeping is not always of absolute necessity: so
that

First, the heart be truly grieved and displeased for sin.

Secondly, if a sinner have an earnest desire to sheede tears, and cannot:
being hindered, either in regard of the greatness of the sorrow of heart,
oppressing the heart, that it cannot ease it self by weeping: or else from the
constitution of the body, being unapt to yield tears: for in this case, God
accepts the inward sorrow of the soul, and the good affections of the heart,
for the tears of the eyes. Secundum quantitatem interioris affectionis, and
secundum abundantiam lachrymabilis h^moris, est, vel non est in homine s^e^us
c^rporalis. ^^min. l. 1. c. 43.
It is says one, according to the quantity of the inward affection, and the
measure of moist and waterish humors of the eyes, that any one either weepeth,
or is hindered from weeping.

Now, considering that God requires not only an Against those who mou^ne and
weep greatly for outward crosses, but very little for their sins
inward godly sorrow and grief of heart, but likewise an outward mourning
lamentation and weeping for sin, yea, and great mourning and sorrowing for
our great sins; and forasmuch as the Saints and children of God have
practiced the same, moreover, considering that it is so necessary, and
profitable for us, to weep and mourn for our sins; this reproues the world
for the great neglect of this duty. O how ordinary, and usual a thing is it
with people, to mourn and weep for worldly crosses, and troubles that befall
them, for loss of goods, and cattle, and for the departure of their friends,
neighbors and acquaintance! it is a marvelous thing to behold how
excessiuely many mourn and weep for the loss of their dearest friends, as
husband, wife, children, their only son. But few are there, that weep and
mourn seriously for their sins. Pro. 14. 9.
Fools says Solamon, make a mock at sin. Foolish, wicked people have no
moderation in worldly sorrow; but sport themselves with their sins: and if
they sheede any tear in regard of sin, it is with laughing at sin, and not
weeping for sin. Does the Father go heavily for the death of his first
borne? And does the sorrowful mother mourn, and weep, and wring her hands,
for the departure of her only son? O how much more cause have we to mourn,
and weep for our sins, which have been the death of the Son of God? Mat.
2. 18.
Rachel wept for her children, and would not be comforted, because they were
not. Rachel wept for her sons, we ought to weep for our sins: she, because
they were not: we, because they are yet remaining, and are not done away.
Woeful then and lamentable is their condition, whose heart is soft, and whose
eyes are moist and waterie, to sheede tears for worldly wants, for temporal
losses, for bodily pain and grief; but have hard hearts, and dry eyes, not
able to strain forth a sorrowful sigh, nor wring out a brinish tear for
their sins.

CHAP. VII. Of confession of sin.
COnfession of sin, is the third step of grace, 3 Confession of Sin.
whereby the penitent sinner returns from sin unto God. For after that a
sinner has sorrowed after a godly sort for his sins, he returns unto God
by confessing his sins; as the prodigal son returned to his Father,
confessing, and saying, Luke 15. 18.

gathered from that saying of our Savior Christ, Mat. 5. 23. 24

either to the Pastor of his soul, or to some other discreet, faithful, and
trusty friend, that is able to counsel and comfort him in his distress.
According to S. James his direction, Jam. 5. 16.
Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another. Such is our
confession to man.

God. When as the poor penitent sinner gets himself into some secret place,
and there falling down before the Lord; by humble confession lays open his

sins before God, in hope to find mercy with the Lord.

Now, the confession of sin, which I here entreat of, is not confession unto
man, but unto God. In handling whereof, I will show, Four things.


First, what Confession of sin unto God, is. Secondly, the sorts and kinds
of it. Thirdly, the manner of performing it, that our confession may please
God. Fourthly, I will use motives to persuade thereunto.
For the first: Confession of sin, is an humble acknowledgement 1 What
confession of sin to God, is. Pola. Synt. c. 2. l. 6. c. 37.
of our sins before God, arising from an inward godly sorrow of heart for
sin, whereby the sinner does witness against himself, that he has
offended God, and deserves punishment, having a purpose of heart never to
offend God any more.

For the second: Confession is of two sorts. 2 The sorts and kinds of it,
Twofold.


General, and

Particular.

General, when a Sinner does only in a general manner confess that he is a
sinner, that he has offended 1 General.
God, that he has broken Gods commandments, and done wickedly, etc.

Particular confession of sin, is an acknowledgement 2 Particular.
of our particular sins: when having made diligent search by the law of God
to find out our sins, we do then confess those sins which our own
conscience witnesses against us, that we are guilty of, as David when he had
committed adultery with Bathsheba, confessed his sin in particular, saying,
Psalm. 51. 4.
Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight. The
Jews confessed their sins both in general, and particular: In general,
Isa. 59 12.
Our transgressions, say they, are multiplied before thee, and our sins
testify against us, for our transgressions are with us, and as for our
iniquities we know them. And in particular, they confess, and say, Verse. 13.
in transgressing, and lying against the Lord, and departing away from our God:
speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of
falsehood.

The third thing in Confession is the manner how a 3 The manner of making
Confession aright.
sinner is to make confession of his sins, that his confession may be
acceptable to God. David says, Psalm. 32.
I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord. The vulgar Latin
translation reads it thus: Psalm. 32.
I said I will confess against my self mine vnrightousnesse unto the Lord.
From whence six things are observed to be necessary in the confession of
sin.

First, that our Confession of sin be done with premeditation: 5 h Dixi,
confitebor, aduersum me, iniustitiam meam Domino. Six things are necessary in
the Confession of Sin.
that we do not rashly and rudely thrust our selves into the presence of the
Lord, but first search our hearts, try our ways, find out our sins, take
notice of them, view them, consider them, and have them before our eyes, when
we come to make confession of them. This is noted in the beginning of the
sentence. Dixi.
I said; before I confessed my sins, I first thought with 1 That it be with
premeditation.
my self, I considered in my mind the sins which I was to confess, I said
within my self, I will confess my sins.

Secondly, Confession of sin must be in truth, without 2 That it be in (...).
guile, not hiding sin, but plainly and truly confessing our sins:
wherefore he says, Confit^bor.
I will confess: I will make known my sin, I will hide nothing, I will
search every corner of my heart, I will lay open all and every sin. I will
confess my sin.

Thirdly, our Confession must be accusing, not excusing, 3 That it be accusing,
not excusing.
noted in the next words Aduersum me.
against my self. Our confession must be against our selves. Howsoever it be
dangerous for any one to accuse himself before men, yet every sinner must
accuse himself before God; judge himself to have broken the commandments of
God, and condemn himself to be worthy of death. For this cause, a sinner must
come before the Lord in all humility and lowliness of mind, with shame and
confusion of face, being ashamed to lift up his eyes to heaven for the
multitude of his sins and transgressions, saying with Ezra, Ezra 96.
O my God, I am ashamed, and blush to lift up my face to thee my God; for our
iniquities are increased over our heads, and our trespass is grown up unto
the heavens. And must be like the penitent Publican, who coming before the
Lord to confess his sins, Luk 18. 13.
Stood a far off, and would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but
smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.

Fourthly, Confession must be made of sin and iniquity: 4 Confession must be
of Sin, and iniquity.
noted in the word Iniustitiam.
unrighteousness, or transgresgressions. We must not with the Pharisee, boast
our good deeeds, and praise our well-doing; but with the Publicane, confess
our sins, and our selves sinners, and earnestly pray for the pardon of our
sins.

Fifthly, Confession must be made of our own sins: 5 That we confess our
own sins.
wherefore he says, I will confess against my self Meam.
mine unrighteousness, or my transgressions.

S^xtly, Confession of our sins must be made unto the Lord our God; wherefore
he says, I will confess my 6 That our confession be made vnt^ God.
transgressions Domino.
unto the Lord. Confession must be made unto God; to the honor of God, that
God may have the glory, and we the comfort. Of this, David speaks thus in
another place, Psalm. 51 4.
Against thee, thee only have I sinned. So also when he had numbered the
people, his heart smote him, and David said unto the Lord, 2 Samuel 24. 10.
I have sinned greatly in that I have done. Daniel said, Dan. 9 4. 4.
I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, we
have sinned, and committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, etc. Chrysostom
taught the same doctrine, De^ s^luendis pe^catum: Chrysostom. de pae^it Hom. 9.
Tell thy sin only unto God. Again he says, S^lu^te Deus confi^ent^m
vid^a^. Chrysostom. de pae^it. and conf^s.
Let God only see the confessing of thy sins. After this manner we are to
make Confession of our sins.

In the fourth place, I come to the motives which may persuade us to confess
our sins unto God. Which I take 4 Motives to confess our sins unto God.


First, from the necessity; Secondly, from the benefit thereof.
For the first: Confession of Sin unto God, is necessary; 1 (...) necess^ry.
For
for

First, God is chiefly and principally offended by our sins: wherefore it is,
that David having committed 1 God is principally off^nded by our sins
adultery, and thereby having not only offended God, but wronged man, coming
to make confession, says, Psalm. 51. 4.
Against thee, thee only have I sinned. Now, because sin is chiefly and
principally committed against God, therefore it is necessary that we make our
confession chiefly and principally unto God.

Secondly, without confession of sin we can look 2 Without Confession we can
have no remission.
for no remission of sin. Solomon says, Pro. 28. 13.
He that covers his sins shall not prosper, but who so confesses and
forsakes them shall have mercy. Giving us to understand, that he only
obtains mercy of the Lord that confesses his sins; but if any one will
not confess, but hide, and cover his sins, he shall not prosper; it shall
not be well with him, the Lord will show him no favor nor mercy. Wherefore
David says of himself, Psalm. 32. 3. 4. 5.
When I kept silence my bones waxed old, etc. But I said, I will confess my
transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgauest the iniquity of my sin.
David, after he had sinned, for a time kept silence, held his tongue, and
opened not his mouth to confess his sin, but that was pain and grief unto
him, befound no comfort in it; but when he acknowledged his sins, and
confessed his transgressions, then the Lord showed mercy on him, and forgave
him: and David did not obtain mercy and forgiveness at the hands of God,
till that he confessed his sin to the Lord. Nos alit^r salui esse non
possumus, nisi confiteamur paenitentes, quod inique gessimus negligentes. Aug.
We cannot otherwise be saved (says one) but by humble acknowledgement of our
sins, which through our negligence we have so wickedly committed. Before the
sick man can find ease and remedy for the recovering of his health, he must
make his grief known unto the Physician: and the Creeple is not ashamed to
lay open his soars to the passenger, to move him to have pity on him; so
likewise, it is necessary for a sinner by confession of his sins, to make
known the inward diseases, the infirmities and sores of his soul, to the
chief and best Physician of our souls, Christ Jesus; and be as earnest with
the Lord to beg mercy, and crave pardon and forgiveness of his sins, as the
poor beggar by the highway side, is importunate to beg a penny of the
Passenger.

Thirdly, Confession of our sins to God is necessary; 3 If we do not
confess our sins, yet we cannot hide them from God, for God both sees and
knows them.
for if we do not confess them unto God, yet God knows them, and sees them;
yea, Quando i^^m^ celat, D^us ^^dat.
when sinners do foolishly hide and cover their sins, then the Lord lays them
open to the view of the world. The Lord said unto David, 2 Samuel 12. 12.
Thou did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and
before the Sun. When thou did commit thy sin of adultery, thou did it
secretly, thou thoughts that no eye had seen thee, but I beheld thy
wickedness which thou did in secret, and I will punish thee openly; because
thou have sinned, and not confessed thy sin, I will bring thy sin to light,
and thy self to shame.

Secondly, as Confession of sin is necessary, so is it 2 It Is good and
profitable. For
also good and profitable for a sinner: for

First, by Confession of sin, a sinner obtains remission and forgiveness
of sin: so says Solomon, By confession we obtain remission.
Pro. 28. 13.
Who so confesses and forsakes his sins, shall have mercy. S. John says,
1 John 1. 9.
If we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.
And David witnesses of himself, Psalm. 32. 5.
I said, I will confess my transgression unto the Lord, and thou forgauest the
iniquity of my sin. V^i Confessio, ibi remissio, Qua^d^ ^^mo det^gi^, D^us
^egi^, quando homo agnoscit, Deus ign^scit.
Where there is true, hearty, and humble confession of sin, there is
remission and forgiveness. When a sinner uncovers and lays open his
sins, God covers and hides his sins: When a sinner acknowledges and
confesses his sins, God does pardon and forgive him his sins. Upon David's
confession, 2 Samuel 12. 13.
I have sinned against the Lord; Nathan the Prophet says unto David in the
word of the Lord, The Lord has put away thy sin, thou shall not die.

Secondly, Confession of sin is a means to pacify 2 Confession of sin is a
means to turn away Gods turn away Gods wrath and heavy displeasure.
the anger, and to assuage the wrath of Almighty God. Yea, to auert and turn
away the judgments of God, which ar^ threatened against, and hang over the head
of sinners When Jonah the Prophet cried against Nineueh, Io. 3. 4. 8. 9. 10.
Yet ^ortie days and Nineueh shall be over thrown. The Ninevites humbled
themselves before the Lord with fasting and mourning, confessing their sins,
and crying mightily unto God, and when God saw their works, that they turned
from their evil way, then God repented of the evil that be had said, that he
would do unto them, and he did it not. Hereupon is that saying of
Chrysostom, Niniuitae confitentur, and viuu^t: Sodomitae obdurantur and
pereunt, Chry. in Psalm. 106.
The Ninevites confess their sins, and live: the Sodomites are hardened in
their sins, and perish.

Thirdly, Confession of sin is profitable to a sinner; for thereby his
conscience is pacified, and his soul eased. Like as a man being discontent in
his mind, and sore troubled in his thoughts, can take no quiet rest; 3 By
Confession the soul is cased, and the conscience pacified.
his stomach fails him, and his sleep departs from him; till meeting with
a faithful trusty friend, he makes his mind known unto him, lays open
the grief of his heart, and by mutual conference together, finds comfort and
ease: so a sinner that is greatly distressed in soul, and afflicted in
conscience with the remembrance of his sins; by humbling his soul in secret
before the Lord, confessing his sins, laying open his iniquities, and not
hiding his sins, does find great case; for upon ^he sinner's humble
confession, the Lord, who, is the best friend that a poor sinner has, does
marucilousl^ comfort, and refresh the soul of the sinner. So that the heart of
the poor sinner is now comforted, his soul is cased, and his conscience
pacified. Such benefit comes by confessing our sins unto God.

And s^^ing that Confession of our sins unto God,

First, those who will not acknowledge and confess 1 Against those who will
not confess, but hide and cover their sins.
their sins unto God, but hide and cover them; as Adam when he had eaten of
the forbidden fruit, Genesis 3. 8.
bid himself among the trees of the garden, thinking to hide himself and his
transgression from the Lord: wherefore. Job says, Job 31. 33.
If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding min^ iniquity in my bosom.
Job counts it a heinous thing to cover his transgressions, and to hide his
iniquity. And indeed, for any one to cover his transgressions, and to hide his
iniquity, is both foolish, and dangerous. Foolish; for no man can so hide his
sin, but God knows and sees it. A notable example hereof we have in David;
It is wonderful to consider, what devises, what 1 Foolish.
shifts, and inventions 2. Sam. 11.
David used to cover and hide his sin of adultery with Bathsheba Whn David
committed that sin of adultery with Bathsheba, her husband Vriah was in the
wars; wherefore, when David understood that Bathsheba was with child by him,
he immediately sent for her husband purposing that he should go home to his
house, and to his wife, and so the King appointed him, but yet Vriah went not.
This not succeeding then David had another devise; he sent for Vriah again,
and made him drunk: thinking that ^ow Vriah would forget himself, and so go
down to his house, and lie with his wife; yet Vriah went not. This not
prevailing, then did David devise a means for the taking away of Vriah's life.
So that Vriah, the husband of Bathsheba, never came unto her, nor ever had
knowledge of her after that David had defiled her; and so Dauid's sin was found
out, notwithstanding all the devises and cunning shifts which he used to hide
and cover his sin. Chrysostom reasons thus with the sinner, that is loath to
confess his sins, Quae^^m vtilitas tua etiamsi n^n confitearis? number potes
latere Deum? etiamsi non dica^ illa, ipse nouit: si autem tu dicis, ille
obli^is^^^ur. Chry. de poenit. and confess?
What profit have thou if thou do not confess thy sins? Can thou hide
thy sins from God? Although thou confessest them not, yet God knows them: and
if thou do confess them, God (forgiueth and) forgets them. But if thou
wilst not now confess them, be assured that thou shall have them laid open
where there shall be greater shame and greater punishment prepared for thee.
Unless we now lay open our sins before the Lord, the Lord will lay them open
in the day of judgment before all the world. Wherefore, its a very vain, and
foolish thing, for any one to hide and cover his sins.

And its also dangerous. For Solamon says, Pro. 28. 13.
he that covers 2 Dangerous.
his sins shall not prosper. He that covers and hides his sins, God will
not show him any favor, nor mercy, God will not bless him nor prosper him.

Secondly, here are also reproved such as do not 2 Against those that excuse
their sins.
plainly, and truly confess, but excuse their sins: some excuse their
sins, by lessening them: I have sinned indeed, I confess; but my sin is
not very great, it is but a small one, God grant I do no worse, etc, others
excuse their sins, by comparing themselves with others: I confess I have
sinned, but I am not alone; there are others as great sinners as I. Some blame
the stars: I have sinned, and done amiss, but it was my ill fortune, it was
my destiny, I was borne under an ill planet: some blame ill company: but for
such company I had not done so. And some lay the fault on God: It was the will
of God I should do so. Thus, many that have done evil, being either ashamed
of themselves, or afraid of punishment; labor to excuse their sins, and to
shift off their sins from themselves to others, and are loath to accuse
themselves. Excellently does Augustine reason of this point Aug. in Psalm. 31.
Many there are says he, who say when they have sinned, It was the will of God
it should be so: but they that say not so, say thus, destiny made me do it,
the stars caused me to do it; so that herein they do but fetch a compass
to lay their sins upon God. For what are the stars? those that we see in
the ^irmament. Who made the stars? God. Who appointed them in their order?
God. This is as much as if thou should (blasphemously) say, God has made me
to sin.

Thirdly, they are here reproved, who, impudently, with boldness of face,
stand in defense of their sins: 3 Against those that defend their sins.
and in so doing, they are so far from confessing their sins, that they
increase the number of their sins. For Culpa cum defenditur, geminatur.
sin when it is defended is a double sin. Many will not stick to say,
that swearing is lawful, if they swear truly, though it be in their ordinary
communication; wherein Math. 5. 37.
yea and nay should be sufficient. Many think its no offense to do to
others, as others have done to them; and to requite them with the like measure;
though the Scripture say, R^m. 12. 17.
recompense to no man evil for evil. Many defend pride of apparel, and
following of strange fashions, to be but decency and handsomeness; many hold
fornication to be but a trick of youth; a sin whereunto men are naturally
inclined, and therefore excusable. Many great and mighty men, think their
oppressing of the poor people, laying heavy burdens upon their shoulders,
more then they are able to bear, and racking them with extreme Rents and
Fines; to be no sin, because (say they) Its lawful for me to do as I will
with mine own. Lastly, Worldliness, and the setting of the mind too much upon
earthly things, is defended by the worldling, to be careful providence. Thus
the Devil teaches men to hide, and cover their sins, to excuse, yea, to
defend their sins; and so keeps them from confessing and acknowledging
their sins. But if the Lord ever open the eyes of sinners, to let them see
their sins, then they will not cover their sins any longer, neither excuse,
nor defend their sins; but with all humble submission, will fall down before
the Lord, confessing their sins, that they may find mercy with the Lord. For
he that conereth his sins shall not prosper, but who so confesses and
forsakes them shall have mercy.

CHAP. VIII. Of forsaking Sin.
THe fourth step of grace, whereby a sinner turns from sin, rises up higher,
and comes 4 Forsaking of sin. Therein two things.
nearer unto God; is the forsaking of sin. In handling whereof, I will

First, show wherein the forsaking of sin chiefly consists. 1 What things
are required to the forsaking of sin. Three.
Secondly, use motives to persuade thereunto.
For the first: To the forsaking of sin, there are three things necessarily
required.

First, that a sinner do forsake all and every sin: that he leave no sin
unrepented of. Ezechiel says, Eze. 18. 30. 31
Repent 1 That we forsake all and every sin.
and turn your selves from all your transgressions. Again he says, cast away
from you all your transgressions. Teaching us that all sins must be repented
of, and all transgressions must be cast away. The Prophet Jeremy says, Iere.
7. 5.
If you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings: in that he says thoroughly,
it argues a repentance of all our sins. The Lord will not be pleased, if we
do only amend some things that are amiss in us, and leave many things still
amiss and vnamended; but when we go about the work of repentance, and
forsaking of sin, we should do it thoroughly. After many and sundry plagues
sent upon Pharaoh King of Egypt, and his people; ^^ the last, Pharaoh was
content thus far to yield to Moses, to let Israel go, and serve the Lord, so
that their stocke^ and herds might be stayed; but Moses answers Pharaoh
thus: Ex^d. 10 25. 26.
Thou must give us also sacrifice and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice
unto the Lord our God, our cattle also shall go with us, there shall not an
hoof be left behind. The crafty policy of the King of Egypt, was, that the
Israelites leaving their herds and flocks behind them, might have occa^ion to
return to Egypt again: but Moses, to take away all occasion of returning any
more to Egypt, tells Pharaoh, that they will not leave so much as an hoof
behind them. Such ought our resolution to be in our repentance and turning to
God; so truly, and thoroughly to forsake sin, as not to leave any sin in the
heart, not so much as an hoof, not so much as any earthly affection, any
worldly desire, or carnal lust, to bear sway in the heart; least these be
occasions to draw us to the world, to serve sin and Satan again. And although
it be true, I confess; that we cannot so wholly cast out sin, and so
thoroughly cleanse the heart of every evil affection, and unlawful lust, that
no sin should be, and remain in us, (for Pro. 20. 9.
Who can say, I have made my heart clean?) yet we ought so to repent, so to
turn unto God, and so to forsake our sins, that none of our sins should
ever return again, to have rule and dominion in us, that we should obey sin
in the lusts thereof: but we must forsake all and every sin.

Secondly, we must forsake sin, with all the occasions thereof, and with all
the prouocations, entisements, and 2 That we forsake the occasions of evil,
with the prouocations thereunto.
allurements thereunto. Thus S. Paul exhorts: 1. These. 5. 22.
abstain from all appearance of evil. For this cause, we ought to be careful
to shun evil company, as a great occasion of evil. For 1. Cor. 5. 6.
a little leaven, as says the Apostle, leaueneth the whole lump. And he that
touches pitch shall be defiled. So ought we to shake off idleness, the root
of all evil: yea, to avoid places of superstition, profaneness, and
disorder; and whatsoever else may be an occasion to draw us unto sin. Hence
it is, that Genesis 12. 1.
Abraham must go out of Chaldea; Genesis 19. 12.
Lot out of Sodom; and the Jews depart out of Babylon. Isa. 48. 20.
Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans. Babylon is confusion: and
Exi a Babylone fugiens a Caldae^^ hoc est, ^^si intrasti in confusionem
vitiorum exi, etc. Amb. in Psalm. 1.
Go ye forth of Babylon, is, as a Father expounds it, this, Though thou have
entered into the confusion of vices, yet come fo^th: thou ought not to have
entered into sin, but through the law of the flesh compelling thee, and
leading thee captive under the law of sin, thou art brought into the
servitude and slavery of sin. Come forth of this Babylon, deliver thy self
from the bondage of sin. Because Babylon is a place of Idolatry, and Caldea
of vain superstitions, Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans:
depart from evil, and flee the occasions of evil.

Thirdly, we must forsake sin; with the adheren^^: 3 That we forsake sin
with the adherents.
even those things which sin has drawn unto it, and which cleave unto it:
as if any one through a covetous mind, and greedy desire of enriching
himself, has used oppression, extortion, deceit, robbery, briberie, usury,
or any manner of unjust, and unrighteous dealing, and by such unlawful means,
be grown rich; In converting, and turning unto God, its necessary that such a
sinner do not only forsake his sin, and cease to be injurious any more; but
likewise, that he forsake, and depart from those things which he has unjustly,
and wrongfully gotten; by giving satisfaction, and making restitution for wrong
done to others. And that this ought to be done, the Scripture is plain.

In the great fast in Nineveh, the Kings proclamation was, that every one
should Jon. 3. 8.
Fast and put on sackloth, and cry mightily unto God, and that every one
should turre from his evil way, and from the violence that was in their hands.
Now, the violence that was in their hands, compared with that in the prophet
Nah. 3. 1.
Nahum, was robing and spoiling of the poor; making a prey of the poor, and
not suffering the prey which they had unjustly gotten to depart out of their
hands. Samuel, in a general assembly of the people of Israel, speaks thus
unto them; 1 Samuel, 12. 3.
Behold, here I am, witness against me before the Lord, and before his
anointed; whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I
defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to
blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you. Hereby offering to make
restitution, if any man could prove that he had taken any thing from him
wrongfully. So Zacheus stands forth, and makes a proclamation; Luk, 19. 2.
If I have taken any thing from any man by false occusation; I restore him
four fold. As if he had said; if any man can come forth, and accuse me justly,
that I have done him wrong, I will give him satisfaction; or if any man can
justly charge me, that I have taken any thing from him wrongfully, I will
restore it unto him with advantage. The Jews in the time of Nehemiah, were
found greatly to oppress their poor brethren; for the poor people in their
great necessity, had morgaged their lands, their vineyards and houses to the
richer sort, for money to buy them corn: at the last, their lands being
morgaged, and the money received thereupon, spent; they fell into great
distress, and complained of their misery. Nehem. 5. 1. 2. etc.
Nehemiah hearing of it, calls an assembly of the people, and rebukes the
nobles and the rules, for dealing so hardly with the poor; and exhorts them
to have pity on their poor brethren; and to restore to their brethren their
lands, their vineyards, their oliueyards, and their houses, etc. and so they
did; for they said, ver. 12.
We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou
say. And this of the things necessarily required in the forsaking of sin.
2 Motiuesto to persuade to the forsaking of sin.


For the second: the motives which may persuade a sinn^r to forsake his sins,
are three.

First, the Scripture exhorts us very much to this duty: the Prophet David
exhorts to Psalm. 34. 14.
depart from evil. 1 The Scripture.
the Prophet Esaias, to cease from evil. Jsa. 1. 16.
Wash you make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine
eyes, cease to do evil. And to forsake the evil way. Isa. 55. 7.
Let the wicked forsake his way, Zophar's counsailero ^o^, is to put iniquity
from him. Job. 11. 14.
if iniquity be in thy hands, put it f^^r away: and let not wickedness dwell
in thy tabernatles. Ezekiel exhorts, to cast away our sins and
transgressions. Ezeck. 18. 31.
Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby you have transgressed. Our
Savior Christ says to the man whom he had healed Io^, 5. 14.
sin no more: Giving us to understand, that a sinner ought to forsake his
sins, to cease from evil, and to do wickedly no more. Thus the Scripture
exhorteh to the forsaking of sin. 2 The necessity of forsaking sin.


Secondly, the forsaking of sin is very necessary: for

First, It puts a difference between the true, and sound repentance of
penitent sinners, and the counterfeite, and 1 It puts a difference between
true, and false repentance.
fained repentance of hypocrites. Pharao seemed to repent; for he said, Lxod,
9. 27.
I have sinned this time; the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are
wicked. But yet his repentance was not sound, nor true; for after this, ver. 34.
He sinned yet more and hardened his heart. He did not forsake his sin. So
Ahab made a good outward show of repentance, when he bumbled himself with 1.
kin. 21, 27, 29.
Fasting and lying in sackcloth. Yet his heart was not right in the sight of
the Lord, for he did ver. 25.
Sell himself to work wickedness. And after that he had thus humbled
himself, he 1 Kin. 22. 8.
hated the Prophet of the Lord Micaiah; and ver. 27.
put him in prisou. But such is not the repentance of the children of God; for
they do not only humble themselves, and confess their sins, but they forsake
their sins, they cease to do evil, and sin no more. We read not that Noah
was drunken more then once: David, after that he was reproved by Nathan the
Prophet for his adultery with Bathsheba, committed adultery no more. Peter,
after that he had wept bitterly for denying his master denied him no more. and
Paul, when he repented of persecuting the Church, ceased from his sin, and
persecuted no more. Thus, by the forsaking of sin it may be discerned who are
truly turned unto God, and who are not.

Secondly, except we forsake our sins, and cease to 2 Except we forsake our
sins, nothing that we do can please God.
do evil, nothing that we do can be acceptable, and well pleasing unto God.
I instance in prayer: a duty of piety, a thing commanded by the Lord himself;
yet, to the Jews he says, Isa. 1. 15. 16.
When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you, yea, when ye
make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. Wash ye,
make you clean, etc. Showing thereby, that as long as they remained in their
sins without repentance and amendment of life, and would not cease from their
evil ways, nor forsake their sins, their prayers were powered out in vain.
The Scribes and Pharisees, those hypocrites, did in outward show perform many
good duties; for they gave Mat. 6. 1 etc.
alms, they fasted and prayed: which were all good in themselves, duties
required of God: but inasmuch as they did them for hypocrisy and for
vainglory, seeking the praise of men, they had no reward from God. Wherefore
one says, Seducunt scipsos, qui Eleemosynas dant, and a peecatis non cessant
Aug. Euch. cap 74.
They deceive themselves who give alms, and yet cease not from their sins.
Such is the necissity of forsaking sin.

Thirdly, the forsaking of sin is good and profitable for a sinner, both in
regard of his temporal and spiritual state. 3 The benefit of forsaking sin.
Twofold.


First, in regard of a man's temporal state; the forsaking of sin and
iniquity brings outward prosperity and happiness. Of this Zophar speaks thus
to Job, Job 11. 14. 15. etc.
if iniquity 1 To a man's temporal estate. Prosperity.
be in thy hands, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy
Tabernacles. Here Is putting away iniquity, and forsaking of sin: Now hear
what benefit comes thereby. Thou shall lift up thy face without spot, etc. Thou
shall not fear, thou shall forget thy misery: Again, he says, Thou shall
take thy rest in safety, thou shall lie down and none shall make thee afraid,
yea, many shall make suit unto thee. Such outward blessings and benefits come
by the forsaking of sin.

Secondly, concerning a man's spiritual state; the 2 To his spiritual state.
soul of him that forsakes his sins shall be blessed. For

First, he shall obtain mercy: of this Solomon says, 1 Mercy.
Pro. 28. 13.
He that covers his sins shall not prosper, but he that confesses and
forsakes them shall have mercy.

Secondly, his sins shall be remembered no more. So 2 No more remembrance of
sin.
has the Lord promised by Ezekiell, 1 (...). 18. 21. 22
If the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep
all my statues, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live,
he shall not die, all his transgressions that he has committed shall not be
mentioned unto him.

This doctrine of the forsaking of sin, serves to reprove.

First, those sinners which continue in sin, and go 1 Against those that
continue in sin.
on in an ungodly course of life: for many will not be reformed, but hate
instruction, and despise counsel, they will not be brought to repentance,
neither will they forsake their sins. But a sinner that continues
Continuance in sin is dangerous: for
still in his sins, and goes on in an ungodly course of life, knows not
into what a dangerous state he brings his soul; for

First, by continuing in sin, he clogges his conscience, 1 It ouer-burdeneth
the soul with sin.
and presses his soul with an intolerable burden of sin: the wiseman
says, Ecclus. 7. 8. The soul grows worse thereby.
Bind not one sin upon another, for in one thou shall not be unpunished. A
wise man will not ouer-load his beast, lest his beast fall down under his
burden: What a foolish man is he then, that will ouer-load his soul with the
most weighty burden of sin?

Secondly, by continuing in sin, the soul grows any infirmity and disease
in his body, or any wound or sore, if he suffer it to continue, and seek not
help and remedy in time, the longer he lets it continue, the harder will it
be for him to heal and cure the same. Such is the state of the soul; the
longer that a sinner continues in sin and wickedness, the greater are the
breaches which sin makes in the soul, and the harder will it be to repair
them: and the longer that a sinner suffers the sores of his soul to fester
and corrupt, the more hardly shall he be cured.

Thirdly, consider how God threatens those which 3 They that continue still in
sin shall be severely punished.
continue in sin, and how the Lord will punish them except they forsake their
sins: It is said in the Psalms, Psalm. 68. 21.
God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairie scalpe of such a one
as goes on still in his trespasses. And S. Paul says, Romans 2. 9.
The Lord will render tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that does
evil. That is, that still does evil, that goes on in his wickedness, and
continues in evil. Who art thou then that dare go on in thy sinful
course of life, and fear not to continue in thy sins? O take pity on thy
poor soul, lay not to many sins upon it. Ouerload not thy soul with sin.
Thy soul is not able to bear one sin; how is it able to undergo a
multitude? thou can not answer God for one iniquity once committed: how
can thou stand before the face of the Lord, to answer for thy often
transgressions? David counts him a blessed man that Psalm. ^. 1.
Stands not in the way of sinners. That is, (as it is anciently expounded)
that Vt non m^neas in peccato quad^ flatt^ne ^^^turna. Amb. in Psalm. 1.
abides and remains not in sin, by a continual standing in sin. It is
evil to commit sin, but far worse to continue in sin. Wherefore it is
also said, Non qui peccauerit, sed qui in peccatu perseuerau^rit, abhomi^^ ^^is
est Deo. (...).
Not he that sins but he that continues in sin, is abominable to the
Lord. O then beware of standing in sin. Continue no longer in sin, but
forsake thy sins (O man) whosoever thou art; lest thy continuing in sin
bring tribulation and anguish, vexation and destruction to the soul.

Secondly, whereas in the forsaking of sin, there is required a forsaking of
all and every sin: this reprooues Against those who lean some sins but
will not forsake all.
those, who, (it may be) are moved to leave some sins, but will not be
persuaded to forsake all their sins. Many are content with Herod, to do Ma
c. 6. 20.
many things after John's preaching, to amend some faults, and to redress
diverse things that are amiss; but yet are loath to part with all their
sins, there is some one or other beloved sin, which is their darling sin;
they love it as their life, and are as loath to part with it, as with their
life. The covetous man finds such sweetness in the gain that comes in by
his opression, and deceit, by his usury, and briberie, that he is loath to
let slip such opportunity of doing himself good: he could be content to forsake
many other sins, as pride, and drunkenness, prodigal wasting, and
mispending his goods, and diverse other vices, so he might be let alone to
enjoy his profitable sin of Getting. The drunkard is content to forsake some
sins, he hates covetousness, miserable pinching he cannot abide; but to sit
at the wine and to follow strong drink, is his delight, this is the joy of his
heart: take him from this, and take away his life. So the Fornicator and
Adulterer will be content to forsake many sins which other men live in; he
thinks its a heinous transgression, and a horrible sin, to oppress the
poor, to deal deceitfully in bargaining, he is no extortioner, nor usurer,
and (it may be) he is no wine bibber, nor common drunkard: Yet he thinks it a
small sin to go to the stews, or to keep a whore, and to delight himself
with his Herodias. And what is this, but a false dissembling repentance, to
leave some sins, and not to forsake all? to abandon some, and luxuriously to
riot in others? but herein the rule of our Savior Christ is to be observed;
Math. 5. 29. 30.
If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee. Again, If
thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee. for it is
profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy
whole body should be cast into hell. Where, by plucking out the right eye, and
cutting of the right hand; our Savior does not mean, that any one should
dismember his body, by cutting off any sound member of the body: but the
meaning is, that we should avoid all occasions of evil, all entisements and
prouocations to sin; Yea, that we should forsake our sins, though they were
never so profitable, or delightful unto us. Though they were such beloved
sins, as that we were as loath to part with the^, as with our right eye, or
right hand. Wherefore, o man whosoever thou art, if thou live in any sin,
which is a sin either of profit or pleasure, though it be as tender and dear
unto thee as thy right eye, pluck it out; if it be as profitable, as use full
and necessary to thee, as thy right hand, cut it off, away with it, forsake
it, love it no more, delight in it no longer; lest it be the destruction of thy
soul, and cast both thy soul and body into hell.

Thirdly, seeing that in the forsaking of sin, its necessary, 3 Against those
who will not make restitutio^ of their evil gotten goods.
as has been showed, that a sinner do forsake, and depart from those things,
which he has unjustly and wrongfully gotten into his possession: this reproues
those, who by oppression, extortion, deceit, usury, and bribery, are grown
great and waxen rich, Isa, 3. 14.
the spoil of the poor is in their houses: and they will not be moved to make
restitution; they will not suffer the Nah. 3. 1.
pray to depart out of their hands. But certain it is, satisfaction for wrong
done is so expedient, and restitution of evil gotten goods so necessary; that
except there be a willing and ready mind both to give satisfaction, and to
make restitution, no man that has so offended, does truly and thoroughly
forsake his sins; and therefore such a sinner can expect at Gods hands
neither remission nor salvation, until he do willingly, according to his
ability, make restitution. When Zacheus repented of his former evil life, and
turned to the Lord by forsaking his sin, and made proclamation that if he had
taken away any thing from any man wrongfully, he would restore it; upon this
true repentance, and through forsaking his sin, the Lord promised mercy, and
comforted his soul with the assurance of salvation: Luke 19. 8. 9.
This day is salvation come to this house. Herein is that saying verified: Non
tollitur pecca^^m, nisi rest^^uatur ablatum.
Sin is not remitted, unless that which was unjustly taken away be restored.

Fourthly, they are here reproved who forsake sin only for a season, and
afterward, either wittingly and 4 Against those who lean sin for a season,
and after fall to their sins again.
wilfully: or of infirmity, and by occasion fall into sin again. If men,
after that they have seemed to repent, and to cease from sin, do willingly
and wilfully fall into sin again, and even run themselves headlong into
sin, their repentance is no better then the repentance of Pharaoh: this is
with the Dog to return to his vomit, and with the Sow that was washed to her
wallowing in the mire. And then as S. Peter says, 2 Pet. 2. 20. 21. 22.
The latter end of such is worse with them then the beginning. But if their
falling into sin again, be of infirmity and by occasions though I deny not,
but such sinners may be restored by repentance; yet ce^taine it is, their case
is dangerous, by reason of their falling again into sin: For like as a s^cke
man having recovered his sickness, if he afterward fall sick again; that
relapse is very dangerous, and shows a very weak state of his body: So a
sinner, if upon occasion, and provocation, if through infirmity, he fall into
the same sin again. This is very dangerous* and if it be often, the more
dangerous: it shows the state of that soul to be very weak; it argues a
great weakness of grace in resisting of sin: and if there be no resisting
of sin, no striving against inward corruptions, but men give way to their
passions and lusts, and yield the reins to their unruly affections, those wild
horses. I demand where is the forsaking of sin? where is ceasing from evil?
wherefore a Christian feeling this infirmity in himself, that he is subject to
often falls, should be diligent to search and try his own ways, to find out
the deceitfulness of his own heart, and be exceeding wary over himself,
watching over his thoughts, over his words, and over his actions, that he
offend not. As our Savior said to the lame man whom he had healed, Ioh. 5. 14.
Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.
So a sinner having repented of his former sins, and being washed from his
sins, should say unto himself; Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more,
lest a worse thing come unto thee. And he may fitly turn the words into a
Prayer: Lord, I confess I have sinned, and done wickedly; but upon my true
repentance, thou have pardoned my sin, and healed my soul: Now, Lord keep
me I beseech thee, from falling into sin any more: I am now made whole, Lord

unto me.

CHAP. IX. Of Reformation, or amendment of life.
THe fifth step of grace, whereby a sinner returns 5 Amendment of life.
from sin unto God, and rises higher toward Heaven, is Reformation, or
Amendment of life. In handling whereof, I will

First, show by what means a sinner may come to amendment There in three

of life. Secondly, declare how and after what manner, amendment of life is
wrought. 1 Means whereby a sinner may come to amendment of life.
Thirdly, use motives and persuasions, whereby a sinner may be moved to amend
his life.
Touching the first: The means whereby a sinner may come to amendment of life,
are two.

The first, is the operation and working of the holy 1 The working of the holy
Spirit.
Spirit of God; renewing the mind, and putting new life of grace into the
soul. Of this, the Lord speaks thus by Ezechiel, Ezekiel* 36. 26. 27.
A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and
I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an
heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in
my Statutes. It is the Spirit of God that makes our spirit new, that softneth
the heart, and gives grace to walk in the statutes, in the ways and
commandments of the Lord.

The second, is the word of God; whereby we are begotten 2 The word of God.
to a new life. Of which S. James faith, Iam. 1. 18.
Of his own will begat he us, with the word of Truth.

The second thing concerning amendment of life, is, 2 After what manner amend
meant of life is wrought in a sinner.
How, and after what manner this blessed change of life is wrought in a sinner.
Reformation or amendment of life is wrought thus:

First, before amendment of life, there must go an unfeigned forsaking of our
former evil conversation: we 1 There must be an utter forsaking of our old
evil conversation.
must first die to sin, before we can be quickened to a new life: we must
first cease from dead works, before we can do good works. First, cease to be
bad trees, bearing evil fruit, before we can be good trees bringing forth good
fruit. Of this S. Paul says, Ephe. 4. 22. 23. 24.
put off concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt
according to the deceitful lusts: and be renewed in the spirit of your mind:
and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
holiness. Non potest ficri homo no^^us, nisi desierit esse vetus. Author
operis imperf. in Math. 6. Hom. 15
Before we can put on the new man, we must first put off the old man. We must
first put off the rags of sin, before we can put on the robe of
righteousness. This must necessarily first be, before we can be renewed and
reformed.

Secondly, amendment of life is wrought in the whole 2 It must be in the whole
man.
man: in soul, and in body: in the mind, in the will, and affections; in the
cogitations and thoughts of the heart; in the eye, in the ear, in the tongue,
and in the hands; in life and conversation. As the mind must be renewed, so the
life must be reformed.

Thirdly, amendment of life must have it beginning within. By Ezechiel, the
Lord says, (...). 36. 26. 27.
A new heart will I It must have it be^inning within.
give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, etc. and I will put my
spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes. Causing the people
henceforward to walk in the statutes of the Lord, is their reformation and
amendment of life. But this reformation and amendment of life was first begun
within: A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you,
says the Lord, to the Scribes and Pharisees, those hypocrites, which outwardly
did appear righteous unto men, but within were full of hypocrisy, and
iniquities our Savior says, Mat. 23. 26.
cleanse first that which it within the cup and platter, that the outside of
them may be clean also. The reason of this, is because the heart of a sinner
not yet renewed, nor sanctified, is no better then a filthy puddle, sending
forth stinking smells and loathsome savors; and like a corrupt fountain, from
whence flows unsavory and unwholesome water. Hence it is, that our Savior
says, Mat. 15. 19.
Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornication,
thefts, false witness, blasphemies. Wherefore, reformation and amendment of
life must necessarily begin within: whosoever would amend his life, must
first cleanse his heart.

Thus it appears, both by what means, and also after what manner, amendment
of life is wrought in a sinner.

In the third place, I endeavor to move the hearts of sinners to amendment of
life, by these motives and 3 Motives to persuade to amendment of life.
persuasions.

First, the Scripture does make it manifest, that a sinner is not only to
repent of his sins past, and to forsake his former sinful life, but he must
also change his 1 God requires it.
evil course, amend his life, and lead a new life. The Prophet David says,
Psalm. 37. 27.
depart from evil and do good. To depart from evil, and to do good are here
coupled together. The Prophet Esai's exhortation, is, Isa. 1. 16. 17.
cease to do evil, learn to do well. After ceasing from evil, follows
learn to do well. Ezechiel says, Ezekiel. 18. 21.
If the wicked will turn from all his sins, that he has committed, and
keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, etc. Here Is not
only required a turning from sin, but also a keeping of the statutes of the
Lord, and a doing of that which is lawful and right. John Baptist preaches
Repentance in this order: first, he says, Mat. 3. 2. 8.
Repent ye; and after this, bring forth fruits meet for repentance. John
Baptist calls upon the people, first, exhorting them to repent, and then to
amend their lives, and to bring forth better fruits. S. Paul's exhortation to
the Romans, is this, R^m. 6. 19.
as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity,
unto iniquity, even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto
holiness. Manasseh King of Judah, was at the first, a very wicked and
idolatrous King; 2 Chro. 33. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.
He built again the hie places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and
he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host
of heaven, etc. And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the
valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments,
and used Witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with Wizards: he
wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger. And he set
a carved image (the Idol which he had made) in the house of God. Such was his
sinful and wicked life; for which the Lord delivered him into the hands of the
King of Assyria, and he was carried to Babylon; And when he was in affliction,
he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of
his Fathers, and prayed unto him, and he was entreated of him, and heard his
supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his Kingdom. And after
this, Manasseh Ver. 15. 16.
took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the Lord, etc.
And he repaired the Altar of the Lord, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings,
and thank-offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel. Here
was his reformation, and amendment of life. Peter, who, through fearfulness,
denied Christ, saying, Mat. 26. 74.
I know not the man; afterward, upon his repentance, does with great boldness
Act. 4. 8. 9. 10. etc.
confess Christ, and preach Christ. So Paul, once Act. 9. 1. 2. 3. 4.
persecuted Christ, but afterward upon his repentance, Per. 20.
preached Christ to be the Son of God. Before this, he was a Lion, now, he is
a Lamb; before, a Wolf devouring the flock, now, a Pastor and shepherd
feeding the flock: before, a persecutour of them that professed the name of
Christ, now, a preacher, and an earnest perswader of all men to believe in the
name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and salvation of their
souls. Thus the Scripture exhorts to amendment of life, and sets before
our eyes examples of penitent sinners, who have not only forsaken their
sins, but also amended their lives; that thereby, we also might be provoked
to amendment of life.

Secondly, to persuade us to amendment of life, consider 1 The necessity of
amendment of life is great. For
that its necessary for every sinner not only to forsake his sins, wherein
he has formerly lived, but also to reform himself, to redress his ways,
and to amend his life. For

First, we are by nature in a corrupt state; Psalm. 51. 5.
shapen in iniquity, 1 By nature we are in a corrupt state.
and conceived in sin: Ephe. 2. 1. 3.
dead in trespasses and sins: children of wrath. And therefore have need to
be renewed, and reformed, that by grace we may be children of our heavenly
Father, and sons of God. It is said of Moab, that Iere. 48. 11.
he has settled on his lees. Moreover, his taste remained in him, and his sent
was not changed. Its a dangerous state of the soul, when a sinner still
remains the same, and is not changed: for if he be not altered and changed
from his former evil state and condition, if he be not renewed nor reformed,
then he settles upon his lees, then his taste remains, and his old corruption
abides in him still. 2 Except we be renewed and reformed, we cannot see the
kingdom of God.


Secondly, a sinner not renewed nor reformed, shall never see the kingdom of
God: for Joh. 3. 3. 5.
except a man be borne again, says our Savior, he cannot see the kingdom of
God. And again; except a man be borne of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God.

Thirdly, except that a sinner redress his ways, reform 3 A sinner that will
not be reformed, casts away his soul.
his life, and bring forth better fruits, he casts away his soul, and shall
utterly perish. The Lord God, as one pitying the state and condition of those
sinners, who will not be persuaded to amend their lives, says, Ezekiel. 18. 31.
cast away from you all your transgressions whereby you have transgressed, and
make you a new heart, and a new spirit, for why will ye die o house of Israel?
And John Baptist preaching repentance, and exhorting to amendment or life, does
thus threaten all such as will not amend their lives, Mat. 3. 10.
every tree which brings not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast into
the fire. By which, it is manifest, that except a sinner do so repent, and so
cast away his sins, as that he be renewed and reformed, as that he amend his
life, and bring forth better fruits, he shall die in his sins, and shall be
cast into hell fire.

And thirdly, as reformation and amendment of life 3 The benefit of amendment
of life is great.
is very necessary, so the benefit that comes thereby, is exceeding great:
for it is a means to bring down blessings of three sorts: Temporal,
Spiritual, and Eternal.

The first benefit that comes by reformation and amendment 1 Outward
prosperity.
of life, is a prosperous and happy state on earth, the enjoying of temporal
good things, as peace, and plenty, and such like blessings, even as God shall
see it good for his children. The Psalmist says, Psalm. 37. 27.
depart from evil, and do good, and dwell for evermore. The LORD speaks thus
to the Jews by Jeremy, Ier. 7. 5. 6. 7.
If you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, etc. then will I cause you
to dwell in this place, in the lend that I gave to your Fathers for ever and
ever. And Moses from the mouth of the Lord shows the people of Israel, what
great prosperity they shall have, if they will Deuteronomy. 28. 1. 2. 3. 4. etc.
hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord, to observe and do all his
Commandments, Blessed shall thou be in the city, and blessed shall thou be
in the field. Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks
of thy sheep.

The second, is spiritual happiness: Reformation and 2 Spiritual happiness.
amendment of life brings a sinner into the happy state of grace: for a sinner
that has forsaken his sins, and amended his life, is awaked out of the
sleep of sin, yea, is raised from the death of sin, to the life of
righteousness; and is delivered from the fear of eternal death: this is
called the first Resurrection, of which St John says, Reu. 20. 6.
Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first Resurrection; on such the
second death has no power.

The third, is eternal glory, and everlasting peace: 3 Eternal glory.
they that are reformed, and lead a new life, they that bring forth the fruit
of good works, and are exercised in doing of good, shall inherit eternal
felicity, and everlasting happiness: at says the Apostle, Romans 2. 10.
glory, honor, and peace to every man that works good.

Now, whereas God requires amendment of life, and seeing that every sinner
ought to be renewed in mind, and reformed in life, as has been proved by
the Scriptures; and seeing that the necessity and benefit thereof is so
great, as has been declared: the consideration hereof is profitable,

First, for Instruction; to teach and admonish us, to prove our selue^, to
search our hearts, and examine our To try our selves whether we be come to
amendment of life.
alteration in our selves, which the Scripture so call^ for at our hands:
without which, a sinner remains still in his old state of corruption, and
without which, he shall never see the kingdom of God, but shall die in his
sins, and perish everlastingly. How greatly then does it concern every one
of us, to search our hearts, and examine our lives, to find out whether we be
the same in heart in mind, in will, in affection; the same in thought, in word,
and deed, that we have been heretofore? whether our hearts be as greatly puffed
up with pride; whether they be as malicious, and as lustful as they have
been? and whether we be as earthly minded as we have been? whether our
tongues be the same that they have been, for swearing, and cursing, and lying,
and slandering, and evil speaking? whether our hands be the same, for violence
and wrong? In a word, whether we live still in the transgression and breach of
the commandments of God, as we have done, and find no change? O then let us
know, that our state is miserable and fearful. And therefore let us with all
speed, make have to set about this work of Reformation, and Amendment of
life. And to encourage us herein, let us set before our eyes the examples of
such penitent sinners, as have not only forsaken their sins, but have also
amended their lives. Manasseh was a very Idolatrous and wicked King; yet upon
his repentance, he reformed himself, and amended his ways, he pulled down his
idols, and set up the worship of the true God. Peter, though through
infirmity he denied Christ, yet repenting, he boldly confessed Christ. And
Paul, though first a bloody persecu^our, yet afterward repenting, became a
zealous preacher. These were all changed in mind, and in life, they came to
amendment of life. S. Ambrose exhorts every one to Scipsum sibi homo abn^get,
and totus mutetur Amb. de poe^it. l. 2. c. 10.
deny himself, and to be wholly changed. And hereupon reports the strange
alteration of a young man; who having lived in lust and wantonness, wantonly
dallying with the strange woman; afterward absenting himself from her, was in
process of time changed and reformed: at his return, meeting with his old
familiar, passes by her; but she impudently calls unto him, saying, It is I.
He answered, Sed ego non sumego. ibid.
But I am not I. I am not now the same that I was: I am changed: I am become a
new man. Happy is he that is so changed. Let us therefore follow these good
examples, and not rest our selves content, till we have attained to that state
of grace, that we may every one truly say of himself, I am not now the same
that I was, I am changed, I am become a new man. Moreover, to encourage us yet
more, to redress our ways, and to amend our lives, let us consider the
benefit of amendment of life. Amendment of life, you have heard, procures
outward prosperity; it brings a sinner into a far better state of grace, and
promises eternal glory. Wherefore, if we would be either happy in this life,
or blessed in the life to come, we must be changed from our former evil
conversation, and come to amendment of life.

Secondly, this reprooues those, who hold it sufficient Against those who only
cease from some evil, but do no good.
do no good, and think they have amended their lives well enough, if they
have left of to be such as they were before, though they bring forth no good
fruits meet for repentance: whereas the Scripture requires not only a
departing from evil, but also a doing of good. Not only a ceasing from evil,
but a learning to do well. It had not bin sufficient for Manasseh to have left
worshipping of Idols, except he had worshipped the true God: It had been
small praise in Peter, to have wept bitterly for denying Christ, and to have
denied him no more, except he had also boldly confessed Christ: And it had
been but small commendations in Paul, to have left off persecuting Christians,
except he had also labored to do good by preaching Christ: seeking to win
souls, and to bring men to Christ, as before he had labored to drive them
from Christ. If any one has heretofore despised the preaching of the Gospel,
made light of it, and thought basely of the Ministers of the Gospel, the
messengers of God; what great thing does he, if he only cease to be such a
one; except he now love the word of God, and embrace it? except with his heart
he desire it, and long after it? except he also love and reverence the
Ministers of the Gospel, the Messengers of glad tidings? And except he esteem
the Preachers of the Gospel highly in love for their works sake? If any has
offended with his tongue, by swearing, cursing, lying, slandering, etc. What
true repentance does such a one show, except he so leave swearing, and cursing,
and taking of Gods name in vain, as that he learn to use the name of God
^i^h all (...)? And that with his tongue he olesse and praise God? except he so
leave lying as ^ha^ he lea^ne to speak the truth? And so cease from
slandering, and backbi^ing, as that he learn to speak either well of others,
or no ill? So likewise, whosoever has been an oppressor of the poor,
unmerciful, cruel, hard-hearted, or any way injurious to others; what great
thing does he; if he only cease to be cruel, unmerciful, injurious any more;
except he also show mercy and compassion to the poor? except he be liberal
to them that are in want? And except with Zacheus, he give part of his goods to
the poor? For as Chrysostom says, Nihil boni facere, hoc ipsum est malum
facere. Chrysostom. in Ephesians. Hom. 16.
to do no good, is to do evil. The very omitting to do that good, which we
ought to have done is evil, and deserves punishment. And many shall be
condemned at the last day, for not doing of good; for not Math. 25. 41. 42. 43.
feeding the hungry, etc. Wherefore, learn to do well, and be thou exercised
in doing that which is good, or else thou have not truly amended thy life.

CHAP. X. Of perseverance in grace, and continuing in goodness to the end.
THe sixth and last step of grace, whereby a Sinner 6 Perseverance in grace; or,
continuing in well-doing to the end.
in his returning from sin, rises higher, and continues nearer unto God; is
perseverance in grace and goodness, when a Christian, having begun well, holds
on his good course, and continues therein to the end.

Concerning this perseverance; I will Therein, two things.


First, prove that a Christian may persevere, and continue to the end.

Secondly, use motives and persuasions, to move every good Christian to
labor, that he may persevere and continue in goodness even unto the end.

For the first: That a Christian, having faith to believe, 1 A Christian may
persevere, and continue to the end. For
and grace to repent of his sins, having forsaken his sins and amended his
life, and now being in the state of grace; may so persevere, and continue to
the end, is evident; for

First, the Scripture testifies, that such a one shall not 1 The Scripture
affirms that a good and sound Christian shall not be moved.
be moved from his standing in grace. Psalm. 15. 5.
He that does these things (says David) shall never be moved. And again,
Psalm. 125. 1.
They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Syon, which cannot b^ remoeued,
but abides for ever.

Secondly, God that has begun the good work of grace in his children, will
finish it: So says the Apostle to the Philippians, Phil. 1. 6.
Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun, a good work
in you, will perform it 2 God that has begun grace will finish it.
until the day of Jesus Christ.

Thirdly, God will glorify them that are justified from their sins: As Saint
Paul also speaks to the Romans, Romans 8. 30.
Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: 3 They that are
justified shall be glorified.
and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he
also glorified.

Fourthly, An inheritance in heaven is reserved for the elect, and they are
kept by the power of God unto 4 The elect are reserved unto salvation in heaven.
salvation: So says S. Peter, 1 Pet. 1. 3. 4. 5.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his
abundant mercy, has begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible,
and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are
kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.

Now, this being proved that a Christian may persevere, 2 Motives to persuade
to Perseverance.
and continue to the end. In the second place, it is expedient to use
persuasions, whereby every good Christian may be moved to labor for
perseverance, that he may continue in his good state of grace, and hold on his
right course of godliness even unto the end. And the persuasions hereunto are
these.

First, God requires it. When the Israelites had showed 1 God requires it.
their good affections to hear, and obey the word of the Lord, the Lord
commended them, saying, De^t. 5. 27. 28. 29.
They have well said all that they have spoken: And then wishing their
perseverance, teaches them what they ought to do, and shows them what God
requires at their hands; O that there were such an heart in them; that they
would fear me, and keep my commandment always. Saint Paul's exhortation is,
1 Cor. 9. 24.
So run that you may obtain^. In a race, though many run, yet one receives
the prize; and he only receives the prize that continues to the end of the
race: So in the course of godliness, he that so runs his race that he
continues to the end, and with S. Paul does 2 Timothy 4. 7.
finish his course, shall obtain the crown of righteousness. And to the
Galathians he says, Ga^. 6. 9.
Let us not be weary in well-doing.

Secondly, holy and religious men, Saints on earth 2 Holy men have continued in
their goodness unto the end.
have continued in their goodness unto the end. It is said of King Asa, that 1
Kin. 15. 14.
his heart was perfect with the Lord all his days. Paul says, 2 Timothy 4. 7.
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.
And David speaks thus of his perseverance; Ps. 119. 1^2.
I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes, always, even unto the end.
These are examples left for our instruction, to teach us, to labor for the
grace of perseverance, that we may continue to the end, as they did. 3 The
necessity of perseuera^ce.


Thirdly, this grace of perseverance is exceeding necessary; for 1 All that
begin well, do not end w^ll.


First, All that begin well, do not continue in well-doing: many fall away
from their former goodness, and grow worse and worse: of which S. Paul
forewarneth Timothy, saying, 2 Timothy 3. 13. 14.
Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being
deceived, but continue in the things which thou have learned, and have been
assured of. Incipere mu^torum ^st, finire vero paucorum. Auth. operis impert.
in Math. Hom. 24.
Many begin well (says one) but few end well. Which ought to be a caveat for
us to take heed, lest having begun well, we should wax weary of well-doing.
The fall of others should be our admonition, to stand fast in the faith, and to
hold on our course of godliness to the end.

Secondly, except we persevere, and continue to the 2 Except we continue to
the end, we cannot obtain the crown of glory.
end, we cannot obtain the crown of immortal glory, nor possess that
kingdom which is prepared for them, that do persevere and continue to the end.
To the Angel of the Church in Philadelphia, Christ says, Reu. 3. 11.
Hold that fast which thou have, that no man take thy Crown. Such is the
necessity of perseuerence.

Fourthly, to persuade us to persevere, and continue 4 The benefit of
perseverance.
in goodness; consider the benefits that come by continuing in well doing to
the end.

The benefit of perseverance is great. For

First, It brings Salvation: Math. 24. 13.
He that shall endure unto 1 Salvation.
the end, says our Savior, the same shall be saved. Salus in^pi^ntibus
promi^titur, praemium perseuerantibus datur.
Salvation is promised to them that begin well, but the reward is given to them
that persevere and continue to the end.

Secondly, they that continue to the end, shall have a kingdom. So our Savior
promises to his Disciples, and in them, to all that continue to the end,
saying, Luke 22. 28. 29 30.
Ye are they which have contined with me in my temptations, and 2 A kingdom.
I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed unto me, that ye
may eat and drink with me at my table in my kingdom.

Thirdly, through perseverance, we shall come to 3 A Crown.
wear a crown in the kingdom of heaven: Of which S. Paul speaks thus, 2 Timothy 4. 7. 8.
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.
Here Is perseverance: Now, hear what the reward of perseverance is; Henceforth
there is laid up for me a Crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous
Judge shall give me at that day: And not to me only, but unto them also that
love his appearing.

Fourthly, Perseverance in grace, and continuing in 4 Eternal life.
holiness unto the end, brings eternal life: Of which, S. Paul says, Romans 6.
12.
But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your
fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

The consideration of this, that a Christian may persevere, Against those who
fall back from grace and goodness.
that he ought so to do, as has been proved; serves to reprove those who
fall back from grace and former goodness: for which going backward, S. Paul
reprooues the Galathians, and lays folly to their charge: Gal. 3. 3.
Are ye so foolish? having begun in the spirit, are ye now made perfect by
the flesh? No man, says our Savior, having Luke ^. 62.
put his hand to the Plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
Genesis 19. 26.
Lots wife looking back from Sodom, became a pillar of Salt. Ephraim and
Judah are both reproved by the Prophet Hosea, for their want of perseverance
and continuance in goodness. Hosea 6. 4.
O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee?
for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early deaw it goes away.
Our goodness should be of more continuance then the morning deaw, which being
drawn up by the heat of the Sun, vanishes, and is gone. Our goodness
should rather be like the green Bay tree, which is green, and flourishing
both Winter and Summer: Such ought our perseverance in goodness to be, that
neither in the cold winter of adversity, nor in the hot Summer of prosperity,
we lose the greenenesse of grace and virtue; but for goodness, be still the
same, and continue in well-doing in all states, and conditions, through the
whole course of our life. What shall it profit thee (O man) to enter into the
good way, and to turn back again? To begin to do well, and to be weary of
well-doing? To begin well, and to end ill? Wretched Judas, that Son of
perdition, made show of a very good beginning, but his last end was fearful
and damnable. Paul began ill, but he ended well: More happy was Paul, who,
though he began ill, ended well; then Judas, who began well, and ended ill.
Wherefore, if we be going with the Israelites to the Land of Canaan, let us
not think on the Exodus 16. 3.
fleshpots of Aegipt. If we be going with Lot toward Zoar, see we do not
with Genesis 19 22. 26
Lots wife look back to Sodom. And if with Ruth 1. 14. 15. 16.
Naomi, we be going to the Land of Judah, let us not go back again with
Orpah to Moab: But hold on with Ruth to Judah. Yea, let us go on walking in
holiness and righteousness toward the promised Land, the new Jerusalem, the
City whose builder and maker is God. And having escaped the pollutions of the
world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, let us take
heed that we be not again entangled therein, and overcome; lest the latter
end be worse with us then the beginning. And to encourage us herein; let it be
remembered, that except we do persevere in goodness, and continue in a godly
course of life unto the end, we cannot obtain the Crown of immortal glory,
which God has prepared for them that love him: But if we persevere and
continue to the end; then, through the mercy of God, and the merits of Christ
our Savior, we shall obtain salvation, inherit a Kingdom, and be crowned
with glory.

CHAP. XI. Of the time of Repentance.
HItherto, of the manner how a Sinner may truly repent: and of the steps of
grace, whereby a sinner returns unto God, and ascends up to the high
mountain of heaven.

The fourth thing in the treatise of Repentance, is, 4 The time of Repentance.
concerning the time of repentance: And the time when a sinner ought to repent,
is threefold.

The First, is the time of this present life. Threefold.
The Second, is the time of grace. The Third, is the time present.
Touching the First: The time of this present life, even 1 The time of this
present life.
the short time that we have to live hear on earth, is the time, yea, the
longest, and largest time that God has granted unto us for our repentance: as
is evident by the Scriptures. David says, Psa. 6. 5.
In death there is no remembrance of thee; in the grave who shall give thee
thanks? Christ our Savior says, I^h. 9. 4.
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night
comes when no man can work. where by day is meant the time and space of this
present life: and by night, the time after this life. Di^ sumus in hac vita and
nos iuuari a vobis possumus, and vos potestu in nos confer beneficia: cum
autem abierimus illuc, ibi ne^ amicus, neque frater, neque pater idoneus erit
ad liberandum cum, qui ^uplicijs deputetur aeternis. Chrysostom. de co^punct cordis.
l. 2.
while we are in this life says Chrysostom, you may help us, and do us
good: but when we shall depart thither; there, neither friend, nor brother nor
father will be found fit to deliver him that is deputed to eternal torments.
Theophilact upon those words of our Savior Christ, Luke 52. 4. Quand^^ super
t^rram sumus potermus peccata nostra: at posiquam eterra migrauerimus, non
vltra etc clausa enim est ianua. Theophil, in Luke 5.
The son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins: says e while we are
upon earth we may have our sins blotted out: but not after we are departed
out of this life: for then the gate is shut. and another says, * either here
salvation is won or lost.

Now, whereas the time of this present life is the time of our repentance; yea,
the longest, and largest time that God has granted unto any one, to repent and
amend his life; this serves for confutation of that Popish doctrine of
Purgatory; whereby, they make the simple people believe, that their sins may
be purged away after this life; and that satisfaction may be then made, for
temporal punishment: whereas the true purging away of sins, is only in this
life. Now in this life, while God gives us time and space to repent, while the
light of the Gospel shines, and whiles that God offers us the means of
salvation; is the only time for us to work f Aut his salus acquiritur aut
amittitur. Cypr.
out our salvation: now, is the time for us to run, that we may obtain: now,
is the time to fight against our Against Purgatory.
the crown of righteousness: now, is the time, either to win of loose the
kingdom of heaven: and now is the time to ask, seek, and knock: afterward
when the gate is shut it will be to late.

Secondly, the time of our repentance, which God 2 The Time of Grace.
has granted unto us in this present life, is not any time of our life, when
we our selves will: but it is the time of Grace; even that blessed time,
wherein God does graciously offer unto us the means of salvation, calling us
to repentance; and all that space of time, wherein God shows his patience,
and long suffering, forbearing us, and waiting when we will turn unto him. S.
Paul preached thus to the Athenians, who had lived in idolatry and ignorance;
saying, Acts. 17. 30.
the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commands all men every
where to repent. Now, when Christ is reauealed, and the Gospel preached, it is
time for all men every where to repent. And to the Corinthians he says, 2.
Cor. 2. 6.
behold, now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of salvation. the Genesis
6. 3.
hundred and twenty years while the arc was preparing, was the time of
repentance for the old world; wherein Noah a preacher of righteousness warned
them to repent. And the Ion. 3. 4.
forty days granted to the Ninevites, was their time of repentance: whiles
that Jonah the prophet of the Lord threatened them with the overthrow of there
city, except they repented.

The consideration whereof, may admonish us, not to Not to harden our hearts
against the voice of the Lord calling us to repentance.
hearken to the voice of the Lord calling us to repentance; that we do not
wilfully pass over the time of grace offered unto us; and that we do not
despise the patience, and long suffering of almighty God inuiting us to
repentance, this careless passing over the time of grace, and not turning to
the Lord when he called to repentance, was the sin of Jerusalem; noted by our
Savior Christ in his doleful lamentation for them, saying, Luke 19. 42.
If thou had known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which
belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. In that he says,
in this thy day, he gives us to understand, that they had their day, and time
of repentance, wherein God offered them grace and mercy, having long and often
called them by his prophets, and now in the last days, having sent his own
son to call them to repentance: but they regarded it not, and therefore
woeful misery befell them, and their city. Ver. 43. 44.
For the days shall come upon thee, says our Savior, that thine enemies
shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round and keep thee in on
every side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within
thee. and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another, because thou
knew not the time of thy visitation.

Let their example be our warning, to take heed of neglecting, or despising
the means of our salvation: that we do not refuse grace offered, but hearken
to the voice of the Lord calling us to repentance: as the Apostle exhorts,
Heb. 3. 15. 16
To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation, for some when they had heard, did provoke: When the Lord said,
Psalm. 27. 8.
Seek ye my face, David's heart said, thy face Lord, will I seek. So when the
Lord calls to repentance, we should hearken to the voice of the Lord; and when
the Lord says, return and repent, the heart of a sinner should answer and
say, Lord I return, Lord I repent.

Thirdly, the time limited for our repentance, is the time present: now; yea,
the (...)
very instant of time, in regard 3 The time present.
of our duty for the practice of repentance. This time of repentance is
expressed in the Scriptures by these terms, To day; and now. Heb. 3. 15.
To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. Joel. 2. 12.
Therefore also now says the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart.
thus speaks S. Ambrose concerning the time of our repentance: Agenda est
paenitentia, non solum solicit, sed etiam mature Amb. de poeuit. l. 2. c. 1.
We ought to be careful not only to repent, but to repent betimes.

The consideration of this, that the time p^esent is the time of repentance;
serves to reprove the folly of those, who defer their repentance, and put
off their amendment Against those that deferie their Repentance.
repentance till they be sick, thinking that they may both make their wills,
and repent all on a day. Young men think its to soon for them to repent: and
old men think its soon enough: there is no time ouerpast. As the sluggard
says, Pro. 6. 10.
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber: so the covetous man says, yet a little
gain; the licentious, yet a little pleasure, and every sinner that is loath to
part with his sins, deferres the time with God, and puts off his repentance
from day to day: and is vnwil^ing to repent now. or to day, but promises to
repent tomorrow, and hereafter, though perhaps he mean it not. Like to the
men of Iabesh Gilead who being besieged be Nahash the Ammoni^e, said, 1 Samuel
11. 10.
To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seems
good unto you: when as they meant nothing less; for they had aid promised
them by Saul, for this deferring of repentance, the Lord reproved the people
of Jerusalem, and cried woe against them, Jer. 13. 27.
Woe unto thee, o Jerusalem. will thou not be made clean? when shall it once
be? for this cause, the virgins that did not prepare to meet the bridegroom,
Christ the Lord, but carelessly delaied and deferred the time, are called Math.
25. 2. 3.
foelish virgins. And indeed, whosoever do defer their repentance, and put
of their turning to the Lord, from day to day, they are not wise, but foolish:
and They that defer their repentance do foolishly.
their folly appears in diverse things.

First, A Sinner by deferring repentance continues longer in his sins: and
continu^^^ in sin 1 By deferring repentance a sinner continues longer in.
sin.
(as has been showed before) is very dangerous: the longer that a sinner
deferreth his repentance, the more sins has he to repent of. Quid enim quod
diff^ratian vt plura peccata committas? Ano. de pauit. l. 2. c. 11
Wherefore is it says a Father, that thou still deferrest thy repentance? is
it that thou may commit more sins? the more sins that any one
commits, the harder will be his repentance: the more enemies he has to
fight against: the greater striving shall he have to get the victory, and the
greater sorrow must he have for his sins.

Secondly, whosoever deferreth this repentance till 2 No man is certain of the
time to come.
herafter, does foolishly; for he is not certain of the time to come: to day,
is our day to repent in, and now is the time that the Lord would have us to
turn unto him, and no man can assure himself of to morrow. Wherefore Solomon
says, Pro. 27. 1.
boast not thy self of to morrow, for thou know not what a day may bring
forth. That foolish rich man, boasted of many years; Luke 12. 19.
soul, thou have much goods laid up for many years. When as God said unto
him, Ver. 20.
thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee. God has given us
to day to repent in, but has not promised to wait for our repentance till to
morrow. How foolish then are we to defer our repentance till hereafter,
having to day, and not being sure of to morrow?

Thirdly, to defer repentance till a man be old till 3 He that deferrs
Repentance till old age, is then unfit to repent.
the evil days come upon him, and till death be ready to cease upon him, is
foolish, and dangerous; for whosoever does so, makes himself unfit to repent. If
the young man defer his repentance till his middle age, and the Lord then
strike him with sickness, and death Cease upon him before he have repented,
how hard will it be for him then on a sudden to repent? How hardly will he be
persuaded to leave his old companions? To part with his friends and
acquaintance? To forsake the world? To deny himself? And to yield unto death?
But how much harder will this be in an old man, that has deferred his
repentance to the end of his days, when sickness and old age meet together?
When as Moses says, Psalm. 90. 10.
their strength is labor and sorrow. And when those evil days are come, and
those years draw nigh, as Solomon says, Eccles. 12. 1.
when thou shall say, I have no pleasure in them? ^n young age, when a man has
quickness of sight, readiness of hearing, sharpness of wit, strength of
memory, then is it a fit time for a man to apply his heart unto wisdom, to
seek to save his soul, to use the means of salvation, to get faith and
repentance; and not foolishly, to defer all till old age; when, as
experience shows, old folks are usually heard complaining of the pain of
their body, ache of their bones, lamenes of their limbs, dimnesse of sight, and
dullness of hearing. And certain it is, if men have not repented before these
evil daye^ come upon them, they will be very unfit now to begin to learn
this lesson of Repentance, when they are so grieved with pain and ache; yea,
when they are lame, and blind, and deaf.

Fourthly, a sinner that will not now repent, but says 4 No man is sure that
he shall have grace to repent hereafter.
he will repent hereafter, is not sure that he shall repent hereafter; for God
may so harden his heart, that he cannot repent; because that in his life time,
he contemned the means of his salvation, and despised the patience of God,
waiting for his repentance. St Paul speaks thus to the impenitent sinner, that
has despised the patience of almighty God, Romans 2. 4. 5.
despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and
long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to
repentance? But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto
thy self wrath unto the day of wrath. Giving us to understand, that if a
sinner will not repent, when the Lord graciously calls him to repentance,
yea, whiles the Lord shows his patience, and long-suffering toward him,
waiting for his repentance; but obstinately refuses grace, and despises the
patience and long suffering of God: the Lord may so strike him, and that
justly, with hardness of heart, that he cannot repent. Thus it befell that
man, who leading an ungodly life, was wont to boast, that he could repent at
the last hour. And if he had but time to say three words, Domine, miser^^^
mei. Stapl. pr^mp. Mor. Dom. 7. post pentect. 3.
Lord have mercy on me, it was enough: this wicked wretch, as he was riding
over a water, upon a broken bridge, his Horse stumbled, and Horse and Man fell
into the water, and were drowned: yet before their drowning, he had leisure to
pronounce three words; but not those three words which he spoke of in his life
time, Lord have mercy on me; but three other words more fearful, Capiat
omnia Damon.
The Devil take all: and so perished in the water. So fearful a thing is it,
to defer repentance till the last hour.

Fifthly, a sinner, who has all his youth-full days given 5 He that has
served sin all his life time, knows not whether God will accept his service
in his old age.
himself to his lusts and pleasures, who in his best days has served the
flesh, the world, and the Devil; if in his old age, he offer his service unto
God, knows not whether God will accept it. Romans ^2. 1.
I beseech you brethren, says the Apostle, by the mercies of God, that you
present your bodies, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God. God must
have a living sacrifice, holy, and acceptable: and if it be of the worst sort,
as Genesis 4. 3. 5.
Cains was, it is not acceptable to God: now, to give the youth and strength of
our days, to serve the flesh, the world, and the Devil; and to reserve the
weakness of our days, even our old age for God, is to give him of the worst
sort of our offerings. To deny unto God the best of the flocks, and fattest of
the herds for sacrifice, and to offer him the blind, the lame, and the sick,
will not be acceptable to God; as he says by Malachie, Mal. 1. 8.
If ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame
and the sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be
pleased with thee, or accept thy person, says the Lord of host? Now, to serve
sin all the days of a man's life, while he has health, and strength; and to
begin to serve God when he is sick and diseased; when he is lame, and blind,
and deaf; will God be pleased with this service? will he accept thy person?
What great thing is it for thee to give away thy goods, when thou can keep
them no longer? to leave drunkenness, when thou art come to poverty, and
want means to maintain thy drinking? or what praise is it for thee, now to
put away thy Concubine, when lust fails? and not to leave sin, till sin leave
thee? For Jam te peccata dimittunt, non tu illa.
now it may be rather said, thy sins leave thee, then thou thy sins. And
although it be true, that late repentance, if it be sound, and serious, is
never too late; yet late repentance is seldom sound repentance. For S^ra
poenit^^ia aut nulla, aut ficia, aut d^ffi^^^s.
late repentance is either none at all, or fained, or very hard and difficult.

But some may say, the thief on the Cross, repented at the last hour, and
was saved. I ans^ere; the saving Luke 23. 42. 43.
act of Christ, to be reckoned amongst his V^^s misericordiam invenit hora
v^tima, ne quis desp^re^, and vnicus, ne q^i pr^sum^t. Aug.
one found mercy at the last hour, lest any should despair of the mercies of
God; and but only one, lest any should presume of Gods mercy.

Now, seeing that there is such folly, and danger in deferring repentance; let
the counsel of Solomon be acceptable unto us, ^ccles. 12. 1.
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth. And let us not make light
of the counsel of the wise son of Syrach; saying, Eccles. 5. 7.
make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day: for
suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy security thou
shall be destroyed, and perish in the day of vengeance. S. Ambrose thus
reasons with the sinner, that would still defer his repentance, Agens
poenitentiam ad vltimum, and reconcili^tus, si exterit, an se^^rus ^^nc ex^at,
^go non sum securus, etc. nunquid dico damnabitur? non dico. Sed nec
liberabitur dico, etc. vis te frater^a dubio liberari? vis quod inc^rti^ est,
euadere? age poenitentiam dum sanus es. Si enim agis poenitentiam dum sanus es,
and inuenerit te nouissimus dies, securuses, quia egis^^ poenitentiam eo
tempore quo and peccare potuisti. Amb. ad poenitentiam agendam exhort.
he that repents at the last hour, and is reconciled, and so departs out
of this life, whether he be secure and safe from condemnation, I am not
certains Do I say he shall be damned? I say not so. Neither do I say, he
shall be saved. But will thou my brother, be out of doubt concerning thy
salvation? And will thou be delivered from uncertainty? Repent while thou art
in health. For if thou do truly repent in thy health, and the last day so
find thee, then thou art safe; because thou have repented, whilst yet thou
might have sinned. I wi^h that this good counsel of this good Father were
received of all: then would not men be so foolish, to hazard their souls to
the last hour, and venture their salvation upon uncertainty: then would they
not defer their repentance, nor make any tarrying to turn to the Lord, but
with holy David, would Psalm. 119. 60.
make have, and would not delay to keep his Commandments.

CHAP. XII. Of the impediments of Repentance: of the first impediment; doing
evil, and escaping punishment.
THe fifth thing in the Treatise of Repentance, is, 5 Impediments that hinder
sinners from Repentance.
of the Impediments of Repentance: for, notwithstanding that God calls, and
Preachers exhort to repentance; yet experience shows, that sin abounds, the
world is full of iniquity, and few men are truly converted, and turned from
sin unto God. Its necessary therefore, to search, and inquire what hinders
men from repentance. And I find that there are diverse impediments which
hinder sinners from repentance, specially these four. Four.


The first, is doing evil, and escaping punishment. The second, is presuming
on Gods mercy. The third, is custom in sinning. The fourth, is hope of long
life.
The first impediment that hinders sinners from repentance, 1 Doing evil and
escaping punishment. Twofold.
is, doing evil, and escaping punishment. And that both in regard of sinners
themselves, who sin, and do escape punishment for a time; and also of
others, whom they perceive to sin and do wickedly, and yet see no evil
befall them: of both which, Solomon thus speaks Eccles. 8. 11.
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore
the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.

Touching the first: while men live in sin, do wickedly, 1 In their own
experience.
and perceive no evil happen unto them, they think all is well with them, and
that no evil will betide them, though they live so still: this is a great
deceitfulness of sin; for although God be so patient to suffer sinners, yea,
to suffer long, and to wait for their repentance, yet sure it is, if they
repent not, the Lord will bring all their sins to remembrance, and will not
suffer the sinner to go unpunished. And so God tells the wicked man, Psalm. 50.
18. 19. 20. 21
When thou saw a these, thou consentedst with him, and have bin partaker
with adulterers. Thou give thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frames deceit.
Thou sit and speak against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own
mothers son. These things have thou done, and I kept silence: thou thoughtest
that I was altogether such a one as thy self: but I will reprove thee, and set
them in order before thine eyes. Here Is the wicked man brought in, living an
ungodly life, doing vile and abominable things, playing the thief, committing
adultery, giving his tongue to speak evil, to revile, to slander, etc. And
because he sees no vengeance fall upon him, but perceiues that he escapes the
judgment of God, he emboldeneth himself in his ungodly and sinful course of
life, and thinks he may do so still, and that no evil shall befall him: he
thinks that God regards not, and says to himself, God sees not. God ha^h
forgotten, God will not punish it: but God sees and knows all things, God,
who keeps a Register-booke of all our deeds, and has all our sins in
remembrance, will charge the wicked man with all his evil deeds, and tell him
to his face, these things have thou done: though thou thoughtest wickedly in
thy heart, that I had forgotten, yet I will bring thy sins to remembrance, I
will reprove thee for them, and will set them in order before thine eyes. A
sinner that goes on still in his wickedness, because God does not execute
judgment upon him for his wickedness, is like unto a young thief, who,
having stolen once, or twice, and escaped; is encouraged to steal still,
thinking that he shall ever escape: but in the end he is taken, and pays for
all. So a sinner that goes on in any sinful course, and thinks to escape
still, because he has escaped once, or twice, or oftener, in the end, is
punished and plagued for all the evil that he has done. So Solomon shows,
Eccles. 8. 11. 12. 13
because says he, sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. But
it follows, though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be
prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God,
which fear before him. But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall
be prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he fears not before
God. True it is; a sinner may do evil, once, twice, yea, a hundred times, and
God may forbear to execute judgment upon him: (such is the patience and long
suffering of God) but yet, certain it is, God will not always forbear: in
the end, God will come, and will reprove the sinner, will set all his sins in
order before him, and will punish him for all his wickedness: and though it be
well with the wicked man for a little while, yet in the end it shall not be
well with him, neither shall he prolong his days, but the Lord will cut him
off. According to that saving of the Prophet David, Psalm. 37. 9.
evil doers shall be cut off. And as sinners are deceived in this, that having
sinned, and escaped, they hope they shall ever escape: so

Secondly, when they see others sin, and do wickedly, 2 In the example of
others.
and perceive no evil befall them, hence, they take occasion of encouragement
to do evil still, hoping to fare no worse then others. Here, the example of
others, is a great impediment to their repentance: because they see that the
sentence of Gods judgment is not execured speedily upon others, therefore
their hearts are fully set in them to do evil. But who ever did wickedly,
Against those ^h^t do^ evil and think always t^ go unpunished.
of the old world, the destruction of Sedome and the desolation of Jerusalem.
Now, consider this, ye that forget God: the wise man's counsel is good, Eccl.
s. 5. 4.
say not thou I have sinned, and what harm has happened unto me? For the Lord
is long-suffering, and he will in no wise let thee go. If thou sin and do
wickedly, and the (...) do not punish thee for thy wickedness, if no evil
happen unto thee, is it, for that the Lord regards thee not? or forgets
thee, and will not punish thee? No, no, the Lord has all thy sins in
remembrance, and he does only show his patience and long-suffering toward
thee, waiting for thy repentance and amendment of life. For if thou repentest
not, be sure of it, that in the end, the Lord will come as a swift witness
against thee, and lay things to thy charge, which thou think he has
forgotten: and then he will come as a terrible judge against thee, to judge
thee, to condemn thee, and to deliver thee to the tormentors, because thou
have despised the patience and long-suffering of God. God has suffered thee
long, but now he will suffer thee no longer to go unpunished.

CHAP. XIII. Of the second impediment of Repentance: presuming on Gods mercy.
PResuming on Gods mercy, is the second impediment 2 Presuming on Gods mercy.
Where, consider two things.
that hinders many from Repentance. The wicked man that lives in sin, and
leads an ungodly life, because he feels no judgment of God fall upon him
for his sins, presumes to sin still, and pleads for himself; God's
merciful; Christ dyed for sinners, etc. It is true, God is merciful. He is
^xod. 34. 6. 7.
the Lord God, merciful, and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in
goodness and truth: keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving 1 God is only
merciful to penitent sinners.
iniquity, transgression and sin. But understand,

First, that God is merciful only to penitent sinners: to such as Isay 1. 16.
17. 18.
cease to do evil, and learn to do well: to such as Isay 55. 7.
forsake their evil way, and return unto the Lord: to such as Ezekiel. 8. 21.
turn from all the sins which they have committed, and do that which is
lawful and right. And although it be true, that God has mercy, and plenty of
mercy for sinners, though never so wicked and ungodly, if they truly and
unfeignedly repent them of their sins; yet the mercy of God is not extended to
impenitent sinners, to such as are obdurate, and hardened in their sins, not to
such as are grown obstinate, rebellious, and disobedient against the Lord.
Impenitent Kaine, hardhearted Pharao, and despairing Judas, these find no
mercy, these dye in their sins without mercy: only penitent sinners find
mercy: David, Peter, Marie Magdalene, and such sinners as have truly repented
of their sins, have obtained mercy.

Secondly, God is merciful indeed; but as he is merciful, 2 As God is
merciful, so he is also just.
so is he also just: as he is merciful, he is very ready to pardon iniquity,
and to forgive sin; but as he is just, he will punish sinners, and will in no
case spare them that presumptuously go on in their sins: As Moses tells the
presumptuous sinner, Deu. 29. 19. 20
And it come to pass, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless
himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the
imaginations of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst, the Lord will not
spare him: but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealousy shall smoke
against that man, and all the curses that are written in this Book shall lie
upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven.

This serves to reprove those, who by no admonition, Against those that presume
on Gods Mercy.
of life, but still live in sin, do wickedly, go on in sin from day to
day, and say, God's merciful: but do thou not hear (O man) that God is
merciful only to repenting sinners? And understand thou not, that as God is
merciful, so he is also just? A merciful Father, but also a just God? How

CHAP. XIIII. Of the third impediment of Repentance: Custom in sinning.
Custom in sinning, is the third impediment of 3 Custom in sinning.
Repentance: A sinner having once gotten a habit and custom of sinning, is
loath to leave, and very hardly persuaded to forsake his sin: Cons^^t^do est
altera natura.
Custom is another nature. Through long continuance in sin, sin grows to
be a usual thing with a sinner: As it is usual, and natural with him, to
eat, and drink, and sleep; so is it usual, and even natural with him, to
sin. Custom preuailes with him. The Lord greatly reprooues the Jews for
this their custom in sinning; comparing them to the Ethiopian, and Leopard;
Jerem. 13. 23.
Can the Ethiopian change his skin? or the Leopard his spots? then may ye
also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. Letting us thereby see the

be hard for thee to leave thy sin: hard for thee to do good, which have
accustomed thy self to do evil.

CHAP. XV. Of the fourth impediment of Repentance: Hope of long life.
HOpe of long life, is the fourth impediment of 4 Hope of long life.
Repentance: This hope hinders many men from repentance; but this their hope is
a vain hope; and men build this their vain hope upon a very weak and
deceaueable foundation: Some upon their young age; some, upon the strength of
their body; and others, upon the pure and good complexion: One reasons thus, I
need not repent yet, I am but young, I am in my youthful days, in the prime
of my age, in my flourishing years, I hope to live yet many years; I shall
have time enough to repent hereafter; it will be time enough for me to repent
when old age comes. Another thus, I feel my body to be strong and lusty; I
am healthful, I have no pain, nor ache, I feel no infirmity, neither am I
troubled with any disease; I shall live long, I need not repent yet; it will
be time enough for me to repent when my strength fails, when I feel my self
grow weak, and when sickness comes upon me. Another thus, I am of a pure
and good complexion, of a ruddie countenance, death will not come near me, I
may take my pleasure yet a long time: And as for repentance, when I begin to
wax pale and wanne, and when I perceive wrinkles to appear in my face, then I
will repent. Thus foolish are we, to put off our repentance till old age, till
the day of death, and till the last hour. But grant, that God suffer the
sinner to live in his ungodly course of life, even till he be old, yet he will
hope still to live a little longer; there is no man so old, but thinks he may
live yet one year longer: So vainly do men please themselves with the hope
of long life: And this hope of long life harms many a soul, and hinders
thousands from speedy repentance: They hope to live long, and to enjoy many
days and years; they say, Isa. 56. 19.
To morrow shall be as this day: Iam. 4. 14.
Whereas they know not what shall be on the morrow.

The consideration hereof may admonish us not to Not to defer our repentance
upon hope to live long.
to year, upon hope to live long; for that is but a vain hope: Solomon
admonishes us well concerning this, Pro. 27. 1.
Boast not thy self of to morrow, for thou know not what a day may bring
forth. That foolish man that boasted himself in the multitude of his riches,
saying, Luke 12. 19.
Soul, thou have much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat,
drink, and be merry; and hoped to live long, and to see many years, found by
lamentable experience, that his hope was but a vain hope, for he lived not
till the next morning: For Ver. 20.
God said unto him, thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee.
Let not then the hope of long life encourage thee still to sin, and to do
wickedly, but now, betimes repent, while God gives thee time and space to
repent: While God gives thee to day, defer not till to morrow. But repent to
day, Heb. 3. 13.
While it is called to day, lest (as the Apostle says) any of you be hardened
through the deceitfulness of sin.

is, concerning the motives and persuasions, to repentance: which, I reduce to
four heads.

The first, I take from testimonies of Scripture. The Second, from examples of
penitent sinners. The third, from the necessity; and The fourth, from the
benefit of repentance.
Touching the first: the Scripture is plentiful in exhorting 1 Testimonies of
Scripture.
to repentance; persuading to turn from sin, and to return unto the Lord.
Esaias says, Isa 55. 7.
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let
him return unto the Lord. Ezekiel says, repent, and Ezekiel. 18. 30.
turn your selves from all your transgressions. Hosea says, Hos. 14. 1.
O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God. Joel says, Joel. 2. 13.
Rent your heart and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God. And
so the rest of the prophets in the old Testament: In the new testament, we
find John Baptist, the voice of the crier in the wilderness, the preparer of
the way of the Lord, preaching repentance unto sinners: Mat. 3. 2.
repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And again Verse. 8.
bring forth fruits meet for repentance. And when Christ Jesus himself began
to preach; his first Sermon was of Repentance: Mat. 4. 17.
repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The Apostles of Christ walk
in the same steps, preaching repentance to sinners: S. Peter. preached
repentance to the Jews, Acts. 2. 38.
repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
remission of sins. Again he says, Acts. 3. 19.
repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so
S. Paul exhorts the Athenians to repent: Acts. 17. 30.
And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commands all men
every where to repent. And S. James exhorts saying, Iam. 4. 8 9.
cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your heart you dooble minded: be
afflicted and mourn and weep. Thus the Scripture exhorts to repentance.

The second motive to persuade us to repentance, I 2 Examples of penitent
sinners.
take from the example of penitent sinners. to move us to repentance, it is
profitable for us, to set before our eyes the examples of penitent sinners: who
though they have sinned and done wickedly, yet have repented and returned unto
God. Manasseh King of Judah was a great sinner, and for his great sins,
carried to Babylon; but being in affliction, 2 C^ron. 33. 12. 13.
He besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of
his fathers, and prayed unto him, and he was entreated of him, and heard his
supplication, etc. David, though he committed adultery with Bathsheba, yet he
repented and said, 2 Samuel 12. 13. Psalm. ^1. 4.
I have sinned against the Lord, though Peter denied his master Christ, yet he
repented he was sorry for his sin, Mat. 26. 75.
He went out and wept bitterly. And what shall I more say? for the time would
fail me, to tell of Noah, and Lot, and of Solomon, of Marie Magdalen, and
Zaccheus, of the converted Jews, of the keeper of the prison converted by
Paul, and of Paul himself; who, as he himself confesses, 1 Timothy 1. 13.
Was before, a blasphemer, a persecutor, and inturious, but through repentance
obtained mercy. These are examples written for our instruction, that we should
not live in sin, nor go on in any wicked and ungodly course of life, but
repent and amend our lives, as they did: Which serves,

To reprove those, who set before their eyes the lives Against those who are
willing to imitate the Saints in their sins but not in their repentance.
cloakes for their sins: the drunkard looks upon Noah as he was drunken, and
lay uncovered; but not as he awaked from his wine, and repented of his
drunkenness: and reasons; that drunkenness is not so great a sin, for Noah
was drunk, and yet was saved: but willingly forgets, that Noah repented of his
drunkenness; and has not understanding to reason thus; Noah, I hear, was
drunken, and repented; he was d^unke no more: I have been also drunken, I ought
to repent of my drunkenness: God give me grace that I may repent as N^^h did,
and that I may be drunk no more. The adulterer sets before his eyes, David
committing adultery with Bathsheba; and the adultresse, the whorish woman,
Mary Magdalen, living in lewdness: but have not grace to repent with David,
and to weep for their sins with Marie Magdalen. Thus wicked and ungodly men
pervert the examples of penitent sinners to their own destruction. the
drunkard is well pleased to be drunken with Noah, but is loath to repent with
Noah. The adulterer takes great pleasure in committing filthiness with David,
but will not be brought to repent with David: the whorish woman imitates Marie
Magdalen, and that willingly in her naughtiness, but thinks it a grievous
thing to sit weeping for her sins with Marie Magdalen. The sins of the
Saints, and the infirmities of good men are recorded in the Scriptures, not
that we should imitate them in their sins, and be like unto them in their
vices; but rather that we should by their examples be warned to beware of
falling into sin: and if we sin, not to lie and live in sin, but to rise
again by repentance, as they did; and to imitate them in their virtues: Magnus
isse David p^^^auit (...) pe^catu^ (...) le^go (...) sine per^culo peccare
conceditur? Non nam hac de causa cauere debemus, and facta fortia imi^ar^
sanctorum Chrysostom ad baptizandos. Hom. 4.
Worthy David (says Chrysostom) sinned, and that a great sin; what then?
may we therefore sin, and think to escape? No. But for this cause we ought
to be more wary, and to imitate the worthy deeds of the Saints. The examples
of penitent sinners ought to move and persuade us to repentance.

considered first in regard of the benefits of God.
THe third motive to persuade to repentance, 3 The necessity of Repentance. In

I take from the necessity of Repentance: How necessary it is for every sinner
to repent, to turn from sin, and to return unto the Lord, will appear, if we
consider

First, the benefits of God toward us. Secondly, the patience and long
suffering of God. Thirdly, the shortness of our life. Fourthly, the certainety
of death. Fifthly, the uncertainty of the hour of death. Sixthly, the
certainety of the judgment to come. Seauenthly, the uncertainty of the day of
judgment. Eighthly the punishment of impenitent sinners.

are so manifold, and his goodness so great, that we ought thereby to be
moved to repentance; for, when we were not, the Lord God by his omnipotent
power created us: of nothing, he made us something: and not of the meanest sort
of the creatures, but the most excellent creatures upon the earth, little less
then the Angels: for, besides the comely proportion of the body, God Genesis 2. 7.
breathed into man the breath of life: gave him a reasonable and an
understanding soul, whereby we might kgow God, and his Son Christ Jesus,
whom to know is eternal life. Of this speaks S. Augustine thus, Non eram, and
creastime; nihil fueram, and de nihilo me aliquid fecifli: quale antem aliquid?
non stillam aquae, non ignem, non aue^, vel piscem, non serpentem, vel aliquid
ex br^tis animalibus, non lapidem, etc. and paulo minus pare^ me creasti

Soliloq. cap. 7.
I was not, and thou did create me: I was nothing, and of nothing thou have
made me something: and what something? not a drop of water, not fire, not a
bird, or a fish, not a serpent, nor any of those brutish creatures; neither
have thou made me a stone, etc. and thou have made me little less then the
Angels, because thou have given me reason and understanding with them to know
thee. And God has not only created us excellent creatures, but Genesis 1. 31.
good: yea, has created us in Genesis 1. 27.

righteousness and true holiness. Moreover, having so created us; by his
careful providence he still provides things necessary for us, food and
raiment, and all things convenient for this present life. Furthermore, he
protecteth and defends us from perils and dangers: and besides all this, he
has bestowed one incomparable and unspeakable benefit upon us, he has given
us his Son Jesus Christ to die for us, to shed his blood for us, that he might
save us from perishing, that he might redeem us from the bondage of Satan,
and ransom us from the power of the devil: that he might preserve our soul
from hell, and bring us to everlasting life. He has given us his Son, and
with him all things, as says the Apostle, Romans 8. 32.
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all: how shall
he not with him also freely give us all things? He gives us the liberal use
of the creatures, both to feed us, and cloth us: he gives us also
spiritual food for our souls, the word and Sacraments; he gives us the Sun,
the Moon, and the Stars, those glorious lights of Heaven to lighten us; he
has given his Angel^ charge over us to guard us, and prepared Heaven at the
last to receive us. All which, the Lord our God has done for us, not for any
merit or desert in us, (for we were Romans 5. 6. 8. 10.
sinners, and ungodly, we were his enemies) but of his mere mercy, and Ephesians.

love wherewith he loved us in Christ Jesus. O the incomparable love of God
toward us miserable and wretched sinners!

Now, shall not the consideration of these benefits of Gods benefits toward us
should work in us Repentance, and bind us to obedience.
has God made us so good, and shall we be so evil? has he created us in
holiness and righteousness, and shall we be so unholy and unrighteous? does
not God daily do us good, feeding and nourishing us, providing things needful
for us, graciously preserving and defending us? and shall we still vex and
grieve the Lord by our sinful course of life? has he not mercifully given
his Son Christ Jesus to die for us, to save our souls? and shall we foolishly
run headlong into sin, to the utter destruction and wilful casting away
of our souls? O consider this ye that set light by the benefits which God
has done for us. As Moses, upon the rehearsal of the benefits of the Lord
done for Israel, speaks thus unto them, Deuteronomy. 10. 12.
And now Israel, what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the
Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul: So I say unto thee O man,
to whom the Lord has showed great mercy and goodness: upon whom he has
bestowed incomparable benefits: whom God has created, redeemed, and does
continually preserve; what does the Lord thy God require of the^, for creating,
redeeming, and preserving thee, but to repent of thy former sinful life, and
to turn to the Lord thy God? What does he require of thee, but to fear the
Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to ^oue him, and to serve the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul?

CHAP. XVIII. Of the patience and long-suffering of God; and how it ought to
lead us to Repentance.
SEcondly, in regard of the patience and long-suffering 2 The patience and
long-suffering of God.
of God, its necessary for a sinner to cease from his sins, to repent, to
turn from sin, and to turn unto the Lord; for the patience and
long-suffering of God is exceeding great toward a sinner. The Scripture
witnesses the great patience of God: David says, Psalm. 103. 8.
The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger. Of the Jews the Lord says
thus by Esaias, Isa. 65. 2.
I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people. St. Paul
plainly calls God Romans 15. 5.
the God of patience. The patience of God was great to Niniuch, giving them
Ioh. 3. 4.
forty days space to repent. And to the Jews, Act 13. 18.
forty years suffering their manners in the Wilderness. But his patience was
exceeding great to the old world, giving them an Genesis 6. 3.
hundred and twenty years space to repent. How patient the Lord is to sinners,
how slow he is to wrath, and how he forbeares to punish sinners, Chrysostom
shows, comparing the destruction of Jericho with the Creation of the world:
Cum struit Deus, velociter struit.
When God build^th, says he, he builds swiftly: but when he destroys, he
destroys slowly: Cum destruit, tarde destruit, velox Deus struens, tarde
destruens, etc. Chrysostom. de panit. Hom. 5.
God is swift in rearing up, slow in pulling down. In six days he made the
world; in six days he created heaven and earth, the Sea, and all things
therein; but God who in a short time made such a great and glorious frame of
Heaven and Earth* and created such an innumerable company of Creatures; ye^
purposing to destroy but one City in the world, Jericho, he took the space
of seven days. Quare? number potentia imbecillier? sed clementia diutius
tolerat. Chrysostom ibid.
What? was it because he could not destroy lericho in shorter space? No. He
could have destroyed it in a moment; but hereby he showed his clemency, his
patience, his forbearance, and long-suffering. Now, whereas the Lord is so
patient and long-suffering, toward sinners; it should be a forcible motive to
persuade every sinner to repent of his sins, to live no longer in sin, but
to turn from sin, and to turn to the Lord; that so the Lord might be
gracious and merciful unto him. Thus says the Prophet Esaias, Isay 30. 18.
Therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you. The Lord is
gracious and merciful, he waits for our repentance, and expects when a
sinner will turn unto him, that upon his repentance the Lord may be gracious
unto him, and show mercy upon him. So exhorts the Prophet Joel, Joel 2. 13.
Rent your heart and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God, for he
is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents
him of the evil. So S. Peter says, 2 Pet. 3. 9.
The Lord is not slack, concerning his promise, (as some men count slacknesse)
but is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that
all should come to repentance. Wherefore is it that the Lord is patient and
long-suffering? it is because the Lord is so gracious and merciful, that he
would not have sinners to perish in their sins, but rather that they should
come to repentance, and be saved. So then the patience and long-suffering of
God should bring sinners to repentance.

Which serves to reprove those, who abuse the patience Against those who abuse
the Patience and long-suffering of God.
wantonness, and wickedness. Because the Lord is gracious and merciful,
patient and long-suffering, therefore sinners ought to repent, and turn to the
Lord, that he might show mercy upon them; but wicked and ungodly men,
perceiving that they do wickedly, and that God lays no punishment upon them,
but suffers them to go unpunished. Hence they take occasion to sin the more,
and so abuse the patience of GOD, which should lead them to repentance; as the
Apostle reasons against such a sinner, Romans 2. 4.
Despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and
long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to
repentance? The sinner that despises the patience and long-suffering of God,
being nothing moved to repentance, for all the patience and long-suffering of
Almighty God showed unto him, is like to an ungracious Child, who, having done
evil, and being reproved of it by his Father, and admonished to amend,
regards not his Fathers admonition; makes light of his words, and the more
that his Father favors and spares him, the worse he grows. So a wicked and
ungodly man, living in sin, regards not the admonition of the Lord; sets
light by the word of God calling him to repentance; despises the patience and
long-suffering of God; yea, and the longer that the Lord suffers him, and
forbears to punish him, the worse he grows. It is as the Prophet Esaias says,
Isay 26. 10.
Let favor be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness. The
Jews in their affliction remembering their sins, say, Lam. 3. 22.
It is the Lords mercies that we are not consumed. And surely, if we call to
mind our manifold sins and iniquities, which we daily commit against the Lord,
by thought, word, and deed; we cannot but acknowledge, that it is of the Lords
mercies that we are not consumed. The Lord might in his justice cut us off, for
the very first transgression, for one evil thought, for one wicked word, for
one sinful deed: and when we find the mercy and goodness of God so much
showed toward us, as to spare ^s; and suffer us to live, notwithstanding our
vile, wicked, and sinful life; O how ought we to acknowledge the goodness
of God herein? and how ought we to praise the Lord for his mercy and patience
toward us, in suffering us so long? Wherefore, a sinner should be so far from
making the patience of God to be an occasion of deferring, that it ought rather
to hasten his repeatance. And he should reason thus; hitherto, I have lived in
sin, and done wickedly, and yet the Lord has been ^o gracious unto me, that
he has spared me: he might have cut me off in the midst of my sins, it is of
the Lords mercies that I am not consumed: and now, I know not whether the Lord
will forbear me any more: Wherefore, I will delay the time no longer, I will
now repent; I will now return unto the Lord: the patience, and long-suffering,
and the goodness of the Lord shall lead me to repentance.

CHAP. XIX. Of the shortness of our life: of the certainty of death: and the
uncertainty of the day and hour of death: and how in regard of these, its
necessary for a sinner to repent.
THirdly, its necessary for a sinner to repent of his sins, and to amend his
life, in regard of 3 The shortness of man's life.
the shortness of our life. In the first age of the world, men lived long;
because as yet sin was not multiplied in the world: for as one says,
D^c^r^^tus est (...) dec^^sus, s^^^^dum (...), cap. ^6.
the course of man's life was shortened according to the increase of some. For
when sin began to be multiplied on the earth, when the wickedness of man
was great in the earth; then did God drown the world of the ungodly, and
shortened the days of man; so that whereas in the beginning of the world, and
before the stood, men lived eight or nine hundred year; after the flood, they
attained not two hundred: for Abraham lived but an Genesis ^5. 7.
hundred threescore and fifteen years. And Jacob counts his days to be Gen
47. 9.
an hundred and thirty. And in the time of Moses the days of man's life were
counted but Psalm. 90. 10.
threescore and ten.

The Scriptures speak thus of the shortness of man's life. Job says, I^b 14.
1.
Man that is borne of a woman is of few days. David thus, Psalm. 39. 5.
behold, thou have made my days as an hand-breadth, and mine age is as nothing
before thee: verily, every men at his best state is altogether vanity. Our
life, for the shortness thereof, is compared to things of great swiftness,
and short continuance. Job compares our life to a Job 7. 6.
Weauers shuttle: to a running Job. 9. 25. 26.
Post: to the swift Ships: and to the flying of an Eagle hasting to the prey:
to a I^b 14. 2.
flower of the field, that is soon cut down, and withered, as al^o to a
shadow that flees and continues not. David, to the Psalm. 103. 15.
grass and slower of the field, which in the morning flourishes, and grows
up, in the evening is cut down and withers. St James, to a Iam. 4. 14.
vapor that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away. The woman of
Tekoa, in her parable, compares the life of man to 2 Samuel 14. 14.
water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again: and indeed,
Pret^reunt ann^m refluentis aquae.
our years pass away as the running waters. For as all Rivers run into the
sea from whence they came, so do all men run, and have to the earth from
whence they came. Our life is nothing else but a passing from life, and a
tending to death. For from our infancy, we pass to childhood; from
childhood, to young age: from young age, to middle age: from middle age, to old
age: and from old age, to death. Now the shortness of our life ought to be a
great motive to persuade us to repentance and amendment of life. And to be
wary how we spend our days. This, Moses the man of God teaches us from the
consideration of the shortness of our life: for having told us that the length
of our days is but threescore years and ten, hereupon prays, and therein
teaches us to pray, Psalm. 90. 12.
so teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.

This reprooues the great folly of those, who spend their days in vanity and
wickedness: living at ease, passing Against those who spend the sho^t time of
their life, ill.
merry: considering not how short their life is, nor how soon, and suddenly,
they may be cut off, and their days come to an end. It is with many, as Job
says, Job. 21. 13
they spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. It
is the praise of Moses, that when he was in Pharaoh's Court, and might have
lived there in all worldly honor, and enjoyed his pleasures at full; yet Heb.
11. 25.
he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather
affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
season. Letting us thereby understand two things, first, that the pleasures of
sin, are but for a season: secondly, that a wise man, as Moses, will not
adventure the loss of felicity in heaven, which is everlasting, for the
enjoying of the pleasures of sin for a season. Sin is committed in this
present life, and this life is but short: we are but of small continuance here;
and therefore if a man should give himself to all sports and mirth that could
be invented, and solace himself in all worldly delights and earthly pleasures,
even to satietie: yet these pleasures would be but for a short time, but for a
season: now no wise man, none but a very fool will buy his pleasures so dear,
as for the enjoying of his earthly pleasures, to loose heavenly joys; and for
the winning of things temporal, to loose things eternal.

Fourthly, its necessary for a sinner to repent, and amend 4 The certainty of
Death.
his life, if he consider the certainty of death. Our life is but short, and
death is certain: God has determined the end of man's days upon earth. After
that Adam had finned, God said unto him, Genesis 3. 19.
dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return. Job says, Job 14. 10.
Man dies, and wastes away, yea, man gives up the Ghost, and where is he?
David demands, Psalm. 89. 48.
What man is he that lives, and shall not see death? S. Paul says, Heb. 9. 27.
it is appointed unto all men once to die. 2 Samuel 14. 14.
We must needs die. Job 14. 5.
God has determined the days of man, the number of his months are with him,
he has appointed him his bounds that he cannot pass. Death is certain: now
the consideration of the certainty of death, ought to be of great force to
move a sinner to repent, and amend his life, because its certain, he shall
die.

And to add more strength hereunto, consider in the 5 The uncertainty of the
day and hour of Death.
fifth place, the uncertainty of the day and hour of death. We are certain we
shall die, but we are uncertain when we shall die: there is nothing more
certain then death, and nothing more uncertain then the hour of death. Of
this uncertainty of the day and hour of death, Solomon speaks thus: Eccles.
9. 12.
Man knows not his time, as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as
the birds that are caught in the snare, so are the sons of men snared in an
evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them. While the Amalekites were 1 Samuel
30. 16. 17.
eating and drinking and dancing; even in the midst of their mirth, David came
upon them with his men of war, and slew them. While Jobs sons and daughters
Job 1. 18. 19.
were eating and drinking, the house fell upon them, and slew them. While
Belshazzar that great King was Dan. 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
drinking wine, and making merry with his Lords, and with his wives and
concubines, the handwriting appeared on the wall, writing fearful things
against him; which made his countenance to change, caused the joints of his
loins to tremble, and his knees to smite one against another. And Ver. 30.
in that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. These thought
not that death had b^n so near approaching unto them: they thought little,
that death had stood waiting for them, even then, when they were eating and
drinking, and making merry.

Now, the consideration of these things, that death is To prepare for the day
of Death.
ought to be a forcible motive to persuade us to repentance, and amendment of

take heed to your selves, least at any time your hearts be ouercharged with
sursetting and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon

Sixthly, its necessary for every one to repent of his 6 The certainty of the

sins, and to amend his life, to turn from sin, and to turn unto God, in
regard of the judgment to come; for certain it is, we shall come to
judgment: and must answer for all the evil deeds that we have done: and
woeful will that day be unto us, if we have not repented before that day come.

That the day of judgment will certainly come, is evident: Solomon speaks
thus to the young man: Eccles. 11. 9.
rejoice O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days
of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine
eyes: but know thou, that for all these things, God will bring thee into
judgment. S. Paul says, 2. Cor. 5. 10.
we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may
receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether
it be good or bad. And again, Heb 9. 27.
it is appointed unto all men once to die, and after this the Judgment. The
Lord of a great house has his Steward, to whom he commits the rule and
government of his house, but when he pleases, he calls his Steward to an
account, and says unto him, give account of thy Stewardship. The Merchant has
his Factor for him beyond the Seas; but after a space of time, the Merchant
calls his servant to a reckoning: the malefactor being apprehended, is laid in
the prison, and little is said to him, till the Judge come: but after a while,
the Judge comes, and calls him to judgment. We are Gods Stewards: What
good things we have, and enjoy, they are all the gifts of God, we have but the
use of them, God is the right owner of them all; and the time will come, that
the Lord will say unto us, Luke 16. 9.
give account of thy stewardship, thou may be no longer steward. We are Gods
servants: he has committed his talents unto us* to one ten; to another,
five; and to another, one; and the time will come, that God will call us to a
reckoning, to see how we have employed our gifts, and how we have used, or
abused those good things which God has bestowed upon us. Yea, we are evil
doers, such as have offended the majesty of almighty God, transgressed his
laws, and broken his commandments; the time will certainly come, when we
shall be called to judgment, and must stand before the judgment seat of
Christ, to render an account of our deeds, and to receive according to the
things that we have done in this life, whether they be good or bad. O then
consider; how does it stand To cast our account, and make our reckoning
aforehand.
hand? now, to make even reckoning? and now, to repent of our transgressions
and iniquities, that our sins may be blotted out of Gods book? and that when
we come to judgment, our sins be not laid to our charge? This use S. Paul
teaches us to make of the certainty of the judgment to come, in his sermon
to the Athenians, Act. 17. 30. 31
the times of this ignorance, God winked at, but now commands all men every
where to repent: because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge
the world in righteousness. Because God has appointed a day in the which he
will judge the world, therefore all men every where ought to repent. The
certainty of the judgment to come, should move us to repentance.

Seauenthly, Its necessary for a sinner to repent, to 7 The uncertainty of
the day of judgment.
turn from sin, and to return unto the Lord, in regard of the uncertainty
of the day of Judgment. Certain it is, there shall be a day of judgment; but
when that day shall be, is unknown to us: its well known to God, but from us
its hidden, and kept secret. Our Savior Christ says, Mat. 24. 36.
Of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the Angels of heaven, but my
Father only. And again, Mat. 25. 13.
ye know neither the day, nor the hour, wherein the Son of man comes. When
the Disciples asked our Savior, Act. 1. 6. 7.
Lord, will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? He said
unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the father
has put in his own power. Saint Paul compares the coming of Christ to
Judgment, for the uncertainty, and suddenness thereof, to the travail of a
woman: 1. These. 5. 3.
When they shall say, peace, and safety: then sudden destruction comes
upon them, as travail upon a woman with child. S. Peter, to the coming of a
thief in the night. 2. Pet. 3. 10.
The day of the Lord will come says he, as a thief in the night. Thus
uncertain is the day of judgment. And that this uncertainty of the day of
judgment, ought to move us to repentance, appears in the reproof of the
Angel of the Church of Sardis; Romans 3. 3.
Remember therefore, how thou have received and heard, and hold fast, and
repent. If therefore thou shall not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and
thou shall not know what hour I will come upon thee.

This serves to reprove those, who, though they know Against those, who think
that Christ will still defer his coming to judgment.
vainly persuade themselves, that the day of judgment is far off, and that
Christ will not make such have to come to Judgment. But take heed thou
profane man, beware of scoffing at the coming of Christ to Judgment. Say not
thou, 2 Pet. 3. 4. 9.
Where is the promise of his coming? For the Lord is not slack concerning his
promise (as some men count slacknesse) but is long-suffering to usward, not
willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. Though
the Lord be in thy account, slack in coming, it is not slacknesse; it is but
forbearance: it is his long-suffering: because the Lord is not willing that
thou should perish, but that thou should come to repentance. But if thou
shall defer they repentance, and still do wickedly, and say in thy heart,
with that bad servant, Luke 12. 45. 46
my Lord delateth his coming, and shall begin to beat the men-seruants and
maidens, and to eat and drink and to be drunken: The Lord will come in a day
when thou look not for him, and at an hour when thou art not ware, and will
cut thee in sunder, and will appoint thee thy portion with the unbelievers. But
let all them that hope to speed well at the day of judgment, watch and wait
daily and hourly for the coming of Christ to Judgment: because we know
neither the day nor the hour of his coming. And thus our Savior exhorts
us; Mat. 24. 42.
Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord does come. And again, he
says, Ver. 44.
be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man
comes. Seeing we are sure that the Lord will come, and we know not when, not
what day, nor what hour of the day, not what night, nor what watch of the
night; therefore we should watch, having our Luke 12. 35. 36. 37.
loins girded about, and our lights burning, and our selves like unto men that
wait for their Lord, when he will return from the wedding, that when he
comes and knocks, we may open unto him immediately. Blessed are those
servants, whom the Lord when he comes shall find watching. Luke 21. 36.
Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to
escape all those things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son
of man. The wicked shall not stand in the judgment; the countenance of the
Judge shall be so terrible and fearful unto them, that they shall not be able
to hold up their heads, but look down, and turn away from his presence, and
say to the Ren. 6. 16. 17.
Mountains and Rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that
sits on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of
his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand? But as for the righteous;
they shall lift up their heads, and stand with boldness of face, because they
have in their life time made even their reckoning, they are washed from their
sins in the blood of the Lamb: their transgressions and their misdeedes are
blotted out of Gods book: their debts are paid, the Books are canceld;
nothing can now be laid to their charge: they are in favor with God; and Jesus
Christ the Judge, who sits on the Throne, looks favorably upon them,
speaks comfortablie unto them, and bids them Mat. 25. 23.
enter into the joy of the Lord. O then blessed are those servants, whom the
Lord when he comes, shall find watching.

CHAP. XXI. Of the punishment of impenitent sinners: of their Temporal and
spiritual punishment: and how these ought to move us to repentance.
THe eight, and last motive to repentance, in regard 8 The punishment of
impenitent sinners.
of the necessity thereof, I take from the punishment of impenitent sinners.
Its necessary for a sinner to repent, and amend his ways, in regard of the
certain punishment that shall befall him, except he repent. For though the
Lord be so patient to suffer a sinner to go on in his wicked course of life for
a time, and does not punish him for every transgression; yet, if for all the
long suffering, and forbearance of God, the sinner will not be brought to
repentance, but will do evil still; in the end, such an impenitent sinner
shall be sure to feel the hand of God against him, punishing and plagueing him
for all his wickedness, according to that saying of Solomon, Eccle. 8. 12. 13.
Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged; yet
surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear
before him. But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong
his days, which are as a shadow, because he fears not before God. So in
Esaias. The Lord says, Isa. 42. 14.
I have long time holden my peace, I have been still, and refrained my self:
now will I cry like a travailing woman, I will destroy and devour at once.
The Lord is Supplicij sume^di tarditatem, grauitate compensabit. S^u^t. in Isa.
flow in coming to inflict punishment upon wicked and ungodly men; yet he will
come, and when he comes, they shall be sure to feel his heavy hand. Thus
speaks the Lord concerning that woman Iezebell, Ren. 2. 20. 21. 22.
I gave her space to repent of her fornication, and she repented not, Behold I
will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her, into great
tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. When some told our Savior
Christ of the Luke 13. 1. 2. 3.
Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices, Jesus
answering, said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above
all the Galileans because they suffered such things? I tell you, Nay: but
except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. Giving us to understand
thereby, that if men live wickedly, and repent not of their wicked and ungodly
life, they cannot avoid the judgment of God, but the heavy hand of God will
be upon them except they repent: Except they repent they shall perish, and the
consideration of this, that impenitent sinners shall be surely, and soundly
punished; should be a strong motive to persuade every sinner to cease from his
sins, to repent of his wicked life, and to amend his ways, and to the end
that this motive of the punishment of impenitent sinners may pearce more
deeply, let us consider the several punishments wherewith God does usually
plague, and severely punish impenitent sinners,

The punishment of impenitent sinners is of three Of three sorts.
sorts.

Temporal:

Spiritual: and

Eternal.

The first punishment of impenitent sinners, is Temporal: 1 Temporal.
Threefold.
and that is threefold.

The first, in their bodies: The second, in their goods and outward state: The
third, In both.
Touching the first: wicked and ungodly men, impenitent sinners are justly
punished and plagued in their 1 In Body.
Bodies, with some sore disease, and grievous sickness, to consume and destroy
them, as the Lord says in Leuiticus; If ye shall d^spise my statutes, or if
your soul abhor f Leui. 26. 15. 16.
my judgments, so that you will not do all my commandments, but that ye
break my Covenant: I also will do this unto you, I will even appoint over you
terror, consumption, and the burning ^gue, that shall consume the eyes, and
cause sorrow of heart. Solomon disswadeth the young man to avoid the company of
the strange woman, by this motive; Pro. 5. 11.
Lest thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed.

Secondly, in their goods and temporal state: the Lord 2 In goods and
temporal state.
threatens the Israelites if they will not hearken unto him, and will not do
his Commandments, but despise his statutes, and in the stubbornnes of their
hearts, walk contrary unto him, and will not be reformed, then he will Leuit.
26. 16. 18. 20.
punish them seven times more for their sins: they shall sow their seed in
vain; their strength shall be spent in vain. For the Land shall not yield her
increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. Job says of
the sin of Whoredom, Job 31. 12.
it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root out all mine
increase. And Solomon says, Pro. 23. 21.
the glutton and the drunkard shall come to poverty; and drowsinesse shall
cloth a man with rags.

Thirdly, sometimes wicked and ungodly men are punished 3 In both.
both in their bodies and goods, in the destruction and overthrow of all that
they have, because they have done wickedly, and have not repented of their
wickedness. Witness the old world, Genesis 7. 23.
even the world of the ungodly, who were drowned in the flood; and they, their
wives, and children, their beasts and cattle, and all that they had,
overwhelmed in the waters, and did utterly perish. Genesis 19. 24. 25.
Sodom and Gomorrah also were distroyed with fire and brimstone from heaven;
the Lord overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of
the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. And for their impenitencie,
are punished with such a sore judgment, that (as the Apostle says) the Lord
has made them an 2. P^t. 2. 6.
ensample unto those t^^t after should live ungodly* Thus the Lord punishes
wicked and ungodly men, which will not be brought to repentance and amendment
of life, but continue still in their impenitencie; sometimes in their bodies,
sometimes in their goods and temporal state, and sometimes in both.

Which may admonish us, to live no longer in sin, but To cease to do evil, that
it may be well with us and ours.
we have formerly lived, and to amend our lives; as we desire the good and
welfare of our bodies; as we wish well to our dearest friends; and as we
would have the blessing of God upon our substance, and increase; that it may be
well with us, and that the Lord may prosper us in all our ways. For impenitent
sinners draw upon their own heads, temporal punishments, yea, not only upon
themselves, but likewise, upon their wives and children, and all that they have.

The second punishment belonging to impenitent sinners, 2 Spiritual.
is spiritual. The Lord often punishes impenitent sinners with spiritual
judgments: as blindness of mind, hardness of heart, and desperation: When God
justly leaves the sinner to himself. And God justly forsakes the sinner, and
leaves him to himself, because the sinner has first forsaken God: for A Deo
deserti, Deum priores deserunt. Pola. Synt. t. 2. l. 6. c. 4.
wicked men first forsake God, before God forsakes them. Now to be forsaken of
God, and to be left to themselves, is a deserved punishment of sin. St Paul
says of the Gentiles, Romans 1. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28.
they changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to
corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things;
wherefore, God gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own
hearts, etc. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections, etc. And God
gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
convenient. Again, in his Epistle to the Ephesians, he shows, that the Ephe.
4. 17. 18. 19.
Gentiles walked in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding
darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorace that is in
them, because of the blindness of their heart: who being past feeling, have
given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with
greediness. Pharaoh's Exodus 4. 21.
heart was hardened that he would not let Israel go. And to the sinner that
has despised the riches of Gods goodness, and forbearance, and
long-suffering, which should have led him to repentance, the Apostle says,
Romans 2. 5.
after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thy self wrath
against the day of wrath: showing thereby, that when God has showed his
patience, and long-suffering toward a sinner, and the sinner repents not,
but still deferreth his repentance, in the end, the Lord will lay a heavy and
sore judgment upon him, hardness of heart; so that now his heart is hardened,
he has an impenitent heart, a heart that cannot repent. And sometimes the
impenitent sinner is so forsaken of God, and left to himself, that he grows
to desperation: and then through the strong temptations of the Devil, he
works means to bring himself to some untimely death; as 2 Samuel 17. 23.
Ahitophel, and Mat. 27. 5.
Judas.

Now, whereas the Lord does justly punish impenitent To pray that God would
soften our hard hearts.
their minds, hardening their hearts, and leaving them to themselves; this
should teach us to pray unto the Lord, that he would give us grace to lay aside
all pride of heart, and stubbornness of mind, and that the Lord would take
away from us our hard and stony hearts, and that by his good Spirit he would
soften our hard hearts, that we might be moved to repentance, when God calls
us to repentance; and that we might humble our selves before the Lord, and
tremble at his word. For Isa. 66. 2.
to this man will I look, faith the Lord, even to him that is poor, and of a
contrite spirit, and trembles at my word. To this end, let us hear, and
receive the exhortation of the Apostle to the Hebrews, Heb. 3. 12. 13
take heed brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief,
in departing from the living God; but exhort one another daily, while it is
called To day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

CHAP. XXII. Of the eternal punishment of impenitent sinners; and of the
pains of hell. And how this ought greatly to move us to Repent^nce.
THe third punishment belonging to impenitent 3 Eternal. Herein Two things.
sinners, is, eternal punishment: concerning which, I consider these two
things.

First, the place of their punishment. Secondly, the greatness and
grieuousnesse of their punishment.
The place of punishment appointed for the wicked, 1 The place of eternal
punishment. Two fold.
eternally to be punished, and tormented, is twofold.

The one, is the place from whence they shall be excluded:

The other, is the place whither they shall be cast.

Touching the first; The place from whence the wicked shall be excluded, is,
the kingdom of God. 1 C^r. 6. 9.
The 1 The place from whence the wicked shall be excluded.
unrighteous says S. Paul, shall not inherit the kingdom of God. The wicked
shall have no possession or inheritance in heaven; they shall be shut out of
the kingdom of heaven; they shall be cast from the glorious presence of God;
they shall be deprived of the clear vision of God: and they shall not see the
face of God; but shall be 2 These. 1. 9.
punished, as the Apostle says, with everlasting destruction, from the
presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. And this loss of the
kingdom of heaven; to be deprived of the glorious presence of God, never to
see God; to be excluded from the fellowship of the holy Angels, and blessed
Saints in heaven; in a word, to be thrust out of the place of happiness, never
to see good day, never to have comfort any more; is an unspeakable punishment;
yea, a very hell. In so much, that a Father says, N^^i autem qu^a (...)
p^rt^^escan^ Gelien^^nt, ego t^men gloriae amissi^nem, multo amarius (...)
ipsius Gel^en^^^ dic^ ^sse supplicium. Chrys^n Math. Hom. 24.
I know that many do greatly stand in fear of hell; but I say, that the loss
of glory in heaven, is more bitter and grievous, then the punishment of hell it
self. This of the place from whence the wicked shall be excluded.

For the second: the place whither they shall be cast, 2 The place whither the
wicked shall be cast.
is into utter darkness: as our Savior says, Mat. 25. 30.
cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness, there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth. And of this place our Savior again says, Mat. 13. 49.
50.
at the end of the world, the Angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked
from among the just; and shall cast them into the furnace of fire, there shall
be wailing and gnashing of teeth. This is that Isa. 30. 33.
Tophet which is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared, he has
made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood, the breath of
the Lord like a stream of brimstone does kindle it, as says the Prophet
Isaiah. And this place is said in the Revelation to be a Reu. 19. 20.
lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the Reu. 20. 10.
lake of fire and brimstone. Now, if the place prepared for the tormenting of
the wicked and ungodly after this life, be a place of outer darkness, where
there is weeping and gnashing of teeth; if it be a furnace of fire; if there be
fire and much wood; if the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone 2 The
greatness and grieuousnesse of the punishment of the wicked in hell. Their
torment shall be
does kindle it; and if it be a lake of fire and brimstone: O then sure, this
must needs be a most fearful place, a place full of intolerable pain and
torment. And such is the place, whither all impenitent sinners, even all wicked
and ungodly men, which have lived wickedly, and have not repented of their
wickedness, shall be cast.

The second thing in the eternal punishment of impenitent sinners, is the
greatness and grieuousnesse of 1 Universal.
their punishment: the greatness whereof appears in diverse things. For the
torment of the wicked in Hell, First, shall be Universal: whole man shall be
punished: both soul and body shall suffer torment. Mat. 10. 28.
God is able to destroy both soul and body in hell, as says our Savior.
Yea, the wicked shall be tormented in all parts: n^ne shall be free: but most
tormented in those members wherewith they have most offended: Et si nihil in
toto corpore habebat immune summorum cruciatuum, tamen quia quo quis peccat,
^^nitur, lingua ^ius praecip^^ torquebatur. Stel. Carth. in Luc.
Dives was tormented in all and every part, but most tormented in his tongue,
wherewith he had greatly offended. We know that a man cannot endure the burning
of any member of his body, no not of his little finger, without great pain and
torment: O then what an exceeding great torment will it be, to be tormented not
only in one, but in all parts and members of the body? When head, and heart,
tongue and eye, hand and foot, shall all, and all at once, feel intolerable
pain, and horrible torment, and no part of the body be free from torment?
besides the anguish of soul, vexation of mind, and continual horror of
conscience. O how great will that torment be!

Secondly, their torment is easelesse: they have no ease in hell, neither feel
they any metigation of their 2 Easelesse.
pain: for there, Mar. 9. 48.
Their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched. Wicked and ungodly men
dying in their sins without repentance, carry with them the worm of
conscience, which is ever biting, gnawing and stinging them to the heart, and
will give them no rest: Moreover they remain in the flaming fire that is ever
burning, and never goes out: its Mat. 3. 12.
unquenchable fire. and they that are tormented in this fire, have Romans 14. 11.
no rest day nor night. Dives being in hell in torments, requested but a small
thing to be granted him, a drop of water to Luke 16. 24. 25. 26.
cool his tongue; but it might not begranted him: no; in hell there is no ease,
no comfort, no mittigatio^ of pain, no asswaging of torment: there is nothing
but pain and anguish, vexation and torment, nothing but pitiful crying and
howling, wailing and weeping, and gnashing of teeth; by reason of the
intolerable pain, and torment which they endure, and can find no ease.

Thirdly, they are hopeless: they that are tormented 3 Hopeless.
in that flame of fire, have no hope to be delivered, but must still remain in
that hellish prison, and dungeon of darkness: they have no hope ever to come
to the place of joy and felicity: for the door is shut: and they are shut p
Mat. 25. 10.
out. Besides, betwixt them that are in heaven, and them that are in hell,
there is a great gulf, as Abraham answered Dives. Luke 16. 26.
Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that they which would
pass from hence to you cannot, neither can they pass to us, that would come
from thence.

Fourthly, they are remediless: there is no help to be 4 Remediless.
had from any: there, the nearest, and dearest friend cannot help one another
from thence, the Chrysostom. ad pop: Antioch. Ho^. 22.
Brother cannot redeem the brother; there, parents cannot help their
children, nor children their parents: there, the husband cannot defend his
wife, nor the wife yield any succor to her husband.

Fifthly, their torment is endless: they which are tormented 5 Endless. For.
in that flame shall endure everlasting torment: their pain shall endure for
ever, and their torment shall never have end. For this cause, hell fire is
called Everlasting fire Mat. 25. 41.
Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire S. John says, Reu: 20. 10.
The Devil that deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,
where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night
for ever and ever. Earthly pains and torments have an end, but hell torments
have no end, they that are in hell, are tormented day and night, without
ceasing for ever more. The reason whereof is.

First, because the fire of hell can never be quenched, 1 Hellfire can never
be quenched.
but ever burns; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone does
kindle it, and the fire never goes out.

Secondly, at the resurrection of all flesh, the souls and 2 After the
resurrection, the body shall be incorruptible.
bodies of all men shall meet together, even of the wicked; and then the body
shall be changed from a corruptible, to an incorruptible state; then the body
shall be no more subject to corruption, and mortality; death shall no more
seize upon it, for as S. Paul says, 1 Cor. 15. 53.
This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality. Ini^storum corpora immortalia, and incorruptibilia quidem,
passibilia tamen resurgent Bucan.
The bodies of the unrighteous says one, at the Resurrection, shall be
immortal and incorruptible, but yet so, as their bodies shall be subject to
punishment, and apt to suffer torment. Now, because the body shall be then no
more subject to death and corruption; hence it is, that the bodies and souls
of the damned in hell, shall ever live together, that they may ever be
tormented together. And they shall be ever tormented in the lake of fire, but
never dead; ever burning but never consumed.

The consideration hereof, serves.

First, to reprove those, who, though they hear of Against those who live so,
as if there were no hell.
brimstone, and understand that hellfire is an everlasting fire; yet not
withstanding, live so, as if there were no hell, nor any place of torment after
this life. They either are willingly ignorant of this, or foolishly persuade
themselves that they shall not come thither: but without doubt there is a hell:
Mat. 5. 29.
It is profitable for thee, says our Savior, that one of thy members should
perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. again, Mat. 10.
28.
God is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Moreover, Luke 16. 24.
Dives is tormented in the flame: that is, in hellfire, which flameth with
brimstome. And Act. 1. 25.
Judas is gone to his own place: that is, to hell, the place of the damned.
And most certain it is, that to this woeful and lamentable place shall they
go, who live wickedly, and repent not of their sins, before they depart out
of this life, but dye in impenitencie and hardness of heart.

Secondly, this is profitable for instruction to all that know there is a hell,
and hear of the pains and torments To fear God.
of hell; that they learn to fear God, to stand in awe of him, and not to
sin against him, to this, our Savior Christ exhorts us, upon the
consideration of the pains and torments of hell. saying* Fear not them which
c Mat. 10. 28.
kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: But rather fear him which
is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Because there is a hell, and
because that God is able to cast the souls and bodies of all impenitent
sinners into hell, for this cause. see that ye fear God, stand in awe of God,
tremble before him, and sin not against him, for as God is merciful to
penitent sinners, and will pardon the iniquity and transgressions of them that
repent and turn from their sins, and return unto God: So also is he a God
o^ justice and fierce wrath: for as the Apostle says, Heb. 12. 29.
God is a consuming fi^r, and he will cast both the bodies and souls of all
impenitent sinners into hellfire, there, to be tormented for evermore; as it is
also written, Reu. 21. 8.
The fearful, and unbelieving, and the abhomminable, and murderers, and
whore-mongers and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all l^ers, shall have their
part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second
death. O then sinful man, who soever thou art, now betimes repent, and return
unto the Lord, least death unawares seize upon thee, and suddenly thou be cast
down into hell: and there, shall find thy case to be remediless, and thy
torment endless.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the benefit of Repentance: how it remooueth Judgments,
temporal, spiritual, and eternal. Which may persuade us to Repentonce.
HItherto of the motives to Repentance, taken from the necessity thereof.

The fourth, and last motive to Repentance, 4 The benefit of Repentance.
I take from the benefit thereof. Repentance brings much good to the penitent
sinner: he shall be blessed with many blessings. I reduce them to these two
heads. True Repentance Twofold.


First, remooueth judgments: Secondly, procuteth blessings.
First, Repentance remooueth judgments; and those 1 It remooueth judgments.

threefold:

Temporal,

Spiritual, and

Eternal.

Touching the first: Repentance is a means to remove 1 Temporal.
temporal judgments, either threatened against sinners, or else deservedly
drawn upon them for their sins. The Lord sends Jeremy the Prophet to the
people of Israel, saying, Ier. 3. 12.
Return thou backsliding Israel, says the Lord, and I will not cause mine
anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful says the Lord, and I will not keep
anger for ever. Isaiah the Prophet is sent to King Kezekiah with this message;
Isa. 38. 5. 6.
Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the Lord, the God of David thy Father; I
have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy
days, fifteen years: and I will deliver thee, and this City out of the
hand of the King of Assyria: and I will defend this City. Jonah the Prophet
is sent to Nineveh, to threaten them and their City with destruction and
overthrow, except they did repent within the space of forty days. Joh. 3. 4.
Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall he overthrown, But upon this threatening,
Nineveh did repent: for the King and the whole City put on sackcloth and
fasted, and cried mightily unto God, and repented of their evil ways, and
Ver. 10.
God saw their works that they turned from their evil ways. And God repented
of the evil that he had said he would do unto them, and he did it not. When
God saw the people repent of their sins, he repented of the judgment which
he had threatened against them. According to that saying of the Lord in Jeremy,
Ier. 18. 7. 8.
At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom,
to pluck up and to pull down, and to destroy it: if that nation against whom
I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I
thought to do unto them. Thus Repentance remooueth temporal judgments.

Secondly, Repentance remooueth spiritual judgments; 2 Spiritual.
as blindness of mind, hardness of heart, and horror of conscience. It
remooues blindness of mind; When God gives the grace of illumination: for
before that a sinner believes, and repents, he lives in blindness and
darkness; but believing, and repenting, he is enlightened with the knowledge of
the truth, and walks no more in darkness, but in light; as the Apostle
speaks, Ephe. 5. 8.
ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord. Repentance also
remooueth hardness of heart; when God gives the sinner true contrition,
softning the hard heart: For when God gives grace to repent, he gives also a
mollified and melting heart; as it is said in Ezechiel, Ezekiel. 36. 25. 26.
I will sprinckle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your
filthiness, and from all your Idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also will
I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the
stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. Yea,
Repentance also remooueth horror of conscience, and the intolerable burden of
sin; when God gives to the penitent sinner, peace of conscience, and rest to
the soul. Mat. 11. 28.
Come unto me, says our Savior, all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and
I will give you rest. Now, the conscience never has true peace neither does
the soul ever enjoy quiet rest, til sin be done away by Repentance.

Thirdly, Repentance remooueth eternal judgments: 3 Eternal.
so that neither death, nor hell, nor condemnation can hurt them that do truly
believe in Christ, and have unfeignedly repented of their sins, and do now
lead a new life. So says St Paul to the Romans, Romans 8. 1.
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who
walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. And St John says, Reu. 20. 6
Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection; on such the
second death has no power. Thus it is apparent, that great benefit comes by
Repentance; for it remooueth from the penitent sinner, punishments temporal,
concerning the body, and outward state; it delivers from spiritual
judgments: and it That may escape the judgments of God, we must repent of our
sins.


The consideration of which benefit of Repentance, in remoouing Judgments
temporal, spiritual, and eternal: serves for instruction; to teach and
admonish every one that would escape these judgments; that would have
temporal judgments removed from him; that would be delivered from
spiritual, or freed from eternal judgments, and that would be saved from
hell and condemnation; to repent of his sins, to purge and cleanse his heart
from wickedness, that he may be saved; as says the Prophet Jeremy, Iere. 4. 14.
O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou may be saved.
Consider then O man, if the hand of God be upon thee, afflicting thee with any
outward calamity and affliction, in thy body, goods, and outward state; thy
remedy is, to humble thy self before the Lord; with Hezekiah, to pray unto
thy God, and to weep for thy sins: with the Ninevites, to fast, and weep,
and pray, and to turn from all thy evil ways, that so the Lord may be
gracious unto thee, and turn away his anger from thee, that thou may be
preserved.

Moreover, if the Lord lay upon thee spiritual judgments, afflicting thy
soul, and wounding thy conscience with the bitter remembrance of thy sins;
the way to find rest, and comfort to thy soul, is, to seek to Christ, to
come to Christ by faith and repentance, confessing thy sins, and earnestly
suing for the pardon of thy sins; that so Christ may give thee rest. And if
thou stand in fear of hell, and condemnation, if thou be fearful of that
lake of fire; the way and means to escape hell and condemnation, is, now to
repent of thy sins; now, to cleanse thy heart from wickedness; now, to rise
from the death of sin, to the life of righteousness; and now, to have thy
part and portion in the first resurrection, and then the second death shall I
have no power over thee. In a word; if we would be preserved from the wrath of
God, in this life; and saved from hell, and condemnation, in the life to come;
we must now repent, and return to the Lord: now, be renewed in mind, and
reformed in life, or else we cannot be saved.

be a most forcible motive to persuade every one to repent, and to serve God:
and what comfort they bring.

the procuring of blessings. And those also threefold.

Temporal: 1 Temporal.


Spiritual, and

Eternal.

Repentance is a means to procure,

First, temporal blessings. The Prophet Esaias having exhorted to repentance and
amendment of life, Isa. 1. 16. 17.
Wash ye, make you clean, etc. Annexeth this promise, Verse. 19.
If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land. So
Jeremy, Jer. 7 5 6. 7.
If ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, etc then will I cause you to
dwell in this place. so likewise, the Prophet Joel having exhorted to
repentance, Joel. 2. 12. 13.
therefore now says the Lord, turn ye even to me, with fasting, and weeping,
and with mourning, etc. annexeth a promise of temporal blessings: Verse. 19.
The Lord will answer and say unto his people; behold, I will send you corn
and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith.

Secondly, spiritual blessings, as mercy, pardon, and 2 Spiritual.
forgiveness of sins: the Lord by his prophet Isaiah exhorts to repentance;
and upon repentance, makes a large promise of forgiveness of sins. Isa. 1.
16. 17. 18.
Wash ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine
eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do well, etc. Come now and let us reason
together, says the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as
white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. Again,
Isa. 55 7.
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let
him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God,
for he will abundantly pardon. S. Peter in his Sermon to the Jews, having laid
to their charge, the crucifying of Christ, exhorts them to repentance, with a
promise of mercy and forgiveness. Acts 2. 38.
Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
remission of sins. Again, he says, Acts 3. 19.
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.
Mercy is promised to penitent sinners; yea, and that free mercy, and
forgiveness; so promises the Lord by Ezekiel, Eze. 18. 21. 22
If the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep
all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live,
he shall not die. All his transgressions that he has committed, they shall not
be mentioned unto him. And by Jeremy he says, Ier. 31. 34.
I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

Thirdly, eternal blessedness. Which eternal blessedness, 3 Eternal, where,

is to be considered,

First, in regard of the excellency of the place of happiness prepared for all

sins, and are washed from their wickedness.

The place of eternal happiness, is Heaven, whither Christ ascended: S. Mark
speaking of the ascension of Christ, says, Mar. 16. 19.
He was received up into Heaven. And whither Christ the head is ascended,
thither shall his members also ascend; they shall be where he is: As he
himself says, John 14. 2. 3.
I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I
will come again, and receive you unto my self, that where I am, there ye may
be also. Many excellent things are spoken of this heavenly place: It is called
a Kingdom, Mat. 25. 34.
Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you. It is
called the kingdom of God, 1 Cor. 69.
Know ye not, says S. Paul, that the vnrightous shall not inherit the
kingdom of God? It is called the kingdom of Heaven, Math. 7. 21.
Not every one (says our Savior) that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
inthe kingdom of heaven. And it is called an 1 Pet. 1. 4.
Inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, that f^^deth not away, reserved in
heaven for us And this place of happiness is all glorious, and bea^fu^l. So S.
John describes the heavenly Jerusalem, the City of God. Reu. 21. 18. 19. 20.
21.
The building of the wall of it (he says) was of I^sper, and the City was
pure gold, like unto clea^e glass And the foundations of the wall of the
City were ga^^^shed with all manner of precious stones, etc. And the twelve
gates were twelve Pearls, every several gate was of one ^earle, and the
street of the City was pure go^^, as it were transparent glass. Moreover, in
this heavenly City and ble^^ed place, there is no darkness but all light.
For as S. John says again, Verse 23.
The City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it, for
the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. Such is
the excellency of the place of happiness, prepared for the righteous after
this life.

Secondly, the eternal blessedness of the righteous is 2 The greatness of
their happiness.
to be considered in regard of the greatness of their happiness; which is
unspeakable. For as the Apostle says, 1 Cor. 2. 9.
Eye has not seen, nor care heard, neither have entered into the heart of man,
the things which God has prepared for them that love him. But the greatness of
that eternal happiness of the blessed ones in the kingdom of heaven, even of
all the faithful and true believers, of all true penitent sinners, which have
repented of their sins, and are washed from their wickedness, will appear the
For
more, if we consider it in these particulars. 1 They shall be partakers of
glory.


First, they shall be partakers of glory in heaven; they shall be glorious. So
S. Paul says, Phil. 3. 20. 21.
The Lord Jesus Christ shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned
like unto his glorious body. And our Savior Christ says, Math. 13. 43.
The righteous shall shine forth as the Sun in the kingdom of their Father.

Secondly, they shall see God in his glory; they shall 2 They shall see God in
his glory.
en^oy the clear vision of God. Our Savior Christ says, Math 5. 8.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. 1 Cor. 13. 12.
Now we see through a glass (says S. Paul) but then face to face. And S. John
says, 1 Ioh. 3. 2.
Beloved, now are we the Sons of God, and it does not yet appear, what we
shall be: but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him: for
we shall see him as he is. When Moses was desirous to see the glory of God,
and said, Exodus 33. 18. 19 20. 21. 22. 23
I beseech thee, show me thy glory. The Lord answered him, Thou can not see
my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. Yet the Lord yielded thus
far to Moses, that he might see his back parts. It was a great favor that
the Lord showed to Moses an earthly man, that he might see the back parts of
God: but neither Moses, nor any earthly man could ever possibly see the face of
God, and live. But in Heaven, the blessed Saints shall come into the presence
of the Lord, shall see the face of God, and shall behold his glory. To be in
the company of the holy Angels, to behold the Patriarchs, and Prophets, to see
the Apostles and all the Saints, Gloriosa sunt hac, sed multo glori^sius est,
present^m Dei vultum cernere. Aug. Man. c. 17.
These (as S. Augustine says) are glorious things, but it is far more
glorious to be in the presence of God, and to behold his face. Again, he
says, Hac est plaena beatitudo, and tota glorificatio hominis, vid^re faci^m
Dei sui. Aug. So^^lo. c. 36
This is the full blessedness, and the whole glorification of m^n, to see the
face of his God. In the clear vision of God stands the perfection of glory.

Thirdly, they shall be with Christ in glory. For so Christ has prayed to his
Father for them. Ioh. 17. 24.
Father, I will that they also whom thou have given me, be with me, where I 3
They shallbe with Christ.
am, that they may behold my glory which thou have given me. This was the
happiness that S. Paul so much desired. I am (says he) in a straight between
two, having a desire to f Phil. 1. 23.
depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better.

Fourthly, they shall have the company of the holy 4 They shall have blessed
company.
Angels, the fellowship of the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, and all
the Saints of God, as says the Apostle, Heb. 12. 22. 23
Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the
heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels, to the general
assembly, and Church of the first borne, which are written in heaven, and to
God the judge of all, and to the spirits of men made perfect.

Fifthly, they shall have eternal felicity, everlasting happiness, 5 They shall
have eternal felicity.
and endless joy. S. Matthew says, Math. 25. 46.
These shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life
eternal. Of this David says, Psalm. 16. 11.
In thy presence is fullness of joy, at thy right hand there are pleasures for
evermore. The joys of the eternal City are eternal.

Sixthly, In heaven they shall have no hurtful thing to 6 They shall have no
evil, nor want any good thing.
annoy them, and shall want no good thing to make them happy. For as S. John
says, Reu. 21. 3. 4.
God himself shall be with them; and be their God. And God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes; and there shallbe no more death, neither sorrow,
nor crying, neither shall therebe any more pain: for the former things are
passed away. Moreover, there shall be the Re. 22. 2. 3. 4. 5.
pure river of water of life, and the tree of life, and there shallbe no more
curse, but the throne of God, and of the Lamb shallbe in it, and his servants
shall serve him. And they shall see his face, and his name shallbe in their
foreheads. And there shallbe no night there, and they need no candle, neither
light of the Sun; for the Lord God gives them light, and they shall reign for
ever and ever. In Heaven there shall be every good thing, and there shall be
no evil thing. Non enim est ibi malus, neque malitia, etc. Aug. Man. c. 6.
There is (as Augustine says) neither any wicked one, nor any wickedness.
There is no adversary, there is no provocation to sin, there is no want, no
unquietness, no discord, no variance, no violence, no oppression there is no
sorrow, nor sickness, no pain, nor grief, there is no more fear of death,
nor Hell. All these things are past* but there is peace and concord, love and
charity, there is sweet unity and agreement, there is continual rejoicing and
praising of God for evermore. Now, whereas repentance procures to penitent
sinners, blessings temporal, spiritual and eternal. This has a double use.

First, it serves for instruction: to teach and admonish us,

To repent of our sins, and to amend our ways, if To repent of our sins
and amend our wa^es, if we would be either h^p^ie on earth, or blessed in
Heaven.
we desire to be blessed with temporal and spiritual blessings, and to be
patakers of eternal happiness. For thoug^ temporal blessing^ be common to
all, to good and bad; yet the blessing of God upon the outward blessings which
God bestows, is given only to them that repent of their sins, to them that
fear the Lord, and ^e^d a godly life: a^ it is said in the Psalms, Psalm* 34.
9.
There is no want to them that fear him. Again, Psalm. 84. 11.
No good thing will he withold from them that walk^ uprightly. For spiritual
blessings; mercy, pardon and forgiveness of sins, these belong to none but to
penitent sinners, to such as have rep^^ted o^ their sins, and are washed from
their wicked^^sse: as appears in that large promise of me^* and forg^uenesse,
in Esaias, Isay 1. 18.
Though your sinn^s be as, carlet, they shall as white as snow, though they be
red like crimson, they shall be as wool. But to whom is this gracious promise
made, but to penitent sinners? Even to such as have washed and cleansed their
^e^^ts from wickedness? to such as have put away the eui^l of their doings
from before the eyes of the Lord? and to such ^^ have ceased to do evil, and
have learned to do wel^? for to such the Lord says, Com^ n^w, and let us
reason t^g^ther, s^ith the Lord, though your sins be as scarlet, etc. And as
for etern^ll blessedness, and everlasting happ^n^sse; none can be pa^takers
thereof but penitent sinners. The kingdom o^ he^uen is given to no wicked and
ungodly man: only they which have repented of their sins, and are washed
from their wickedness, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. As it is said
in the Revelation, Reu. 21. 27.
There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defil^th, neither
whatsoever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are written in
the Lambs book of life. Again it is said, Reu. 22. 14. 15.
Bl^ssed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the
tree of lift, and may enter in through the gates into the City. For without
are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and
whosoever loves and makes a lie. Wherefore, it greatly stands us in hand to
repent of our sins, to wash and cleanse our hearts from wickedness, to amend
our ways, and to walk in obedience to Gods commandments, to serve the Lord,
and to fear him, if we desire either to be happy on earth, or blessed in
heaven. As the Apostle also exhorts us, saying, H^b. 12. 28.
Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace,
whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.

Secondly, whereas true penitent sinners have the Consolation to the righteous
which are afflicted in this life.
promise not only of temporal benefit^, and spiritual blessings, but also of
eternal happiness, and everlasting felicity in the kingdom of heaven; this
does minister great consolation to the righteous which are afflicted, and
troubled in this present life: for though they endure sorrow and sickness,
pain and grief; though they suffer tribulation or persecution, or whatsoever
affliction they undergo; it is but for this present life; it is but for a
short time; it is but for a moment; it will have an end. And then after that
this short life is ended, the righteous which have patiently suffered with
Christ, shall also reign with Christ, and shall inherit a kingdom. The time
shall come that they shall have no pain, nor sorrow; but shall enter into
eternal joy, shall be partakers of everlasting glory, and shall live blessedly
for ever in heaven. So says S. Paul, Romans 8. 17.
And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and ioynt-heires with Christ: if
so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. This was
David's comfort in his afflictions, Psalm. 27. 13.
I had fainted (says he) unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord
Anciently expounded, Heaven. Aug. Hug.
in the Land of the living. This comforted S. Paul in all his tribulations, and
sufferings; as he himself witnesses, saying, 2 Timothy 4 6. 7. 8
I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departing is at hand; I have
fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord the
righteous judge shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto them
also that love his appearing. And this ought to be our great consolation and
comfort in all distress; knowing that glory in heaven will be a full
recompense for all our sufferings. As S. Paul also says, Romans 8. 18.
I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 2 Cor. 4. 17.
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far
more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.

The end of the second Book.
THE THIRD BOOK OF THE WAY TO THE CELESTIAL PARADISE. Concerning Prayer.
Which is the third means, whereby a Sinner may be saved, and come to life
everlasting.
CHAP. I. The Preface: with the Partition of the whole Treatise of Prayer. The
order of this Treatise.

THe Romans 11. 13.
Apostle of the Gentiles, writing to the Romans, says, Romans 10. 13. 14.
whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved. How then shall
they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in
him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a Preacher?
Which Rhetorical gradation, is adorned with these five, beautiful, ascending
steps:

First, Christ must be preached: Secondly, being Preached, men begin to hear
of Christ. Thirdly, hearing of Christ, they believe in him. Fourthly, believing
in Christ, they begin to call upon the name of the Lord. Fifthly, by calling
upon the name of the Lord, they ascend up to the highest step, salvation.
After that a man by hearing the word preached, has gotten faith, and is
brought to Repentance; then, and not before, is he sit to make an acceptable
Prayer unto God: for except the heart be purified by faith, and purged by
Repentance; God will not regard our prayers, but will hide his eyes, and stop
his ears when we cry unto him: but a sinner, having true faith to believe in
Christ, and through true, and unfeigned Repentance, having his sins washed
away in the blood of Christ; may boldly come to the throne of grace, with
assurance to prevail with God, not only for temporal blessings, but for
spiritual graces; and not only for grace in this life; but also for glory,
and salvation in the life to come. For whosoever shall call upon the name of
the Lord shall be saved.

After Faith and Repentance, then Order requires, that I entreat of Prayer:

In handling whereof, I will show The partition of this Treatise.


First, what Prayer is. Secondly, the sorts and kinds of Prayer. Thirdly, the
persons whom Prayer does concern. Fourthly, the subject or matter of Prayer.
Fifthly, the time of Prayer. Sixthly, the place of Prayer. Seauenthly, the manner
how we are to pray aright. Eighthly, the efficacy and power of Prayer. Ninthly,
the helps and furtherances of Prayer. Tenthly, I will use motives to persuade
unto Prayer.
These are the things, whereof, by the guiding of Gods holy Spirit, I purpose
to entreat. And first, I will show what Prayer is.

CHAP. II. Showing what Prayer is; with the diverse sorts, and kinds thereof.
PRayer is a religious worship of God, whereby, we 1 What Prayer is
do with all humility, and lowliness of heart, make known unto God the
secrets of our heart, through the direction of the Spirit of God; calling upon
God in the name of Christ, in faith, according to his will.

First, I say, that Prayer is a religious worship of God; In^^^^ti^ potissima
est pars cu^tus Dei. Bucan. de orate.
principal part of the worship of God: in so much that in the Scriptures, it
is sometimes used for the (...) Pro toto Dei cultu accipitur. Buca. ibid.
whole worship of God. So St Paul describes the worshippers of God by their
invocation and calling upon God: saying, 1. C^r 1. 2.
unto the Church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in
Christ Jesus, called to be Saints, with all that in every place call upon the
name of Jesus Christ our Lord. So Ananias says of Saul; Act. 9. 13. 14.
Lord, I have heard by many of this name, how much evil he has done to thy
Saints at Jerusalem: and here he has authority from the chief Priests, to
bind all that call on thy name. That is, all that believe in Christ, all that
profess the Gospel of Christ, all that worship God* and call upon God in the
name of Christ.

Secondly, I say, that in Prayer we make known unto make manifest unto God by
Prayer: and as God vouchsafes to speak unto us by preaching, so he is pleased
to suffer unto speak unto him, and to utter the secrets of our heart, by
praying. Wherefore one says, Oration tu^ loc^tio est ad Deum. Quando legis,
Deus tibi lequitur: quando oras, cum Deo loqueris. Aug. in Psalm. 85.
thy Prayer is a speaking unto God. When thou read (the Scriptures) God
speaks unto thee: when thou prayest, thou speak with God.

Thirdly, in Prayer, I mention the Spirit of God, as our guide, our teacher,
and helper.

Fourthly, I say, that in praying we must call upon God: for our prayers must
be made and directed unto God,

Lastly, our prayers unto God must be made in humil^tie, Christ, in faith, and
according to Gods will: which, because they belong to the manner of framing our
Prayers aright, the handling of them more at large, with diverse other things
also belonging thereunto, I refer to their proper places in the Treatise
following: and come to the

Second thing propounded in this Treatise; which is, 2 The diverse sorts and
kinds of Prayer. Threefold.
concerning the diverse sorts and kinds of Prayer. For Prayer is diverse; in
regard of

First, the subject matter of Prayer. Secondly, the affection of him that
prays. Thirdly, the place of Prayer.
First, Prayer in regard of the subject matter thereof, In regard of
is fourfold. 1 The matter of Prayer. Fourfold.


The first, is a Prayer made for the removing of evils: these kind of Prayers
are called deprecations, or supplications. 1 Supplications.


The second, is a Prayer made for the procuring of good things: for the
obtaining of blessings needful for 2 Prayers.
our souls, or bodies. Such Prayers are called precations, petitions, and by a
general name, Prayers.

The third, is a Prayer made for the good of others: 3 Intercessions.
when we come unto God by prayer, in the behalf of others, as we would do for
our selves in the like case. These kind of Prayers are called intercessions.

The fourth, is a calling upon God, with an acknowledgement 4 Thanksgiuings
of Gods goodness toward us, for blessings and benefits received. These kind
of Prayers are called Thankesgiuings. These four sorts of Prayers, St Paul
sets down in his first Epistle, and second Chapter to Timothy; saying, 1 Timothy 2. 1.
I exhort therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,
and giving of thanks be made for all men.

Secondly, Prayer in regard of the affection of him 2 The affection of him that
prays Fourefold.
that prays, is fourfold.

The first, is a fearful Prayer: when he that prays, fears and doubts,
lest he shall not be heard: this is not a godly Prayer, neither is the party
that prays so, 1 A fearful Prayer.
well affected in Praying; because St James bids us Iam. 1. 6.
ask in Faith nothing wavering.

The second, is a lukewarm Prayer: such a Prayer as comes from one that
has little devotion in praying, 2 A lukewarm Prayer.
and small feeling of what he prays for: neither is this a good Prayer,
because S. Paul says, 1 Cor. 14. 15.
I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.

The third, is a rash Prayer: when any one prays unadvisedly, 3 A rash Prayer.
not considering aforehand, to whom he prays, nor for what he prays: only
he rashly casts out words which come from his lips, and were not first in his
heart. Neither is this a good kind of Prayer, because Solomon says, Eccles. 5.
2.
be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any
thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy
words be few.

The fourth, is a fervent Prayer: when one prays 4 A fervent Prayer.
with zeal, and feruencie of spirit, without fainting, and without ceasing.
This is the best kind of Prayer. This is that which St James so commends. I^m.

The effectual, fervent 3. The place of Prayer. Two fold.
Prayer of a righteous man avails much.

Thirdly, Prayer in regard of the place, is twofold.

The one public; in the Church, before the Congregation, 1 Public.
and assembly of the people.

The other, private: and that 2 Private. Twofold.


Either in the house, with the family and household.

Or in the chamber, or some secret place alone.

These are the several sorts, and kinds of prayer; which 1 House.
I have now barely mentioned; but shall have just occasion offered in the
treatise following, to handle more 2 Chamber or secret place.
at large.

CHAP. III. Of the Persons whom prayer does concern: and first, of the persons
praying: showing what things are necessarily required of them that pray, that
their prayers may be acceptable to God.
Having showed what Prayer is, and declared the several sorts, and kinds
thereof: 3 The persons whom prayer does concern. Three.


The third thing to be handled, is touching the persons whom prayer does
concern: and they are three.

First the persons praying: Secondly, to whom we are to pray. 1 The persons
praying. Therein Two things.
Thirdly, for whom we ought to pray.
First, concerning the persons praying, two things are to be observed:

First, all men are bound to pray without exception: no man is exempted from
the performance of this holy 1 All are bound to pray without exception.
duty; neither King, nor subject; noble, nor ignoble, rich, nor poor;
fathers, nor children; masters, nor servants; and not only all, of all sorts,
but every one in particular, 2 We our selves must please God, before our
prayers can be acceptable unto God.
for himself, must call upon the name of the Lord, if he will be saved.

Secondly, the persons praying are to be so qualified, that they themselves may
please God, and be acceptable in his sight, before they can make any acceptable
prayer unto God, it is said of Abel G^n. 4. 4.
The Lord had resp^ct unto Abel, and to his offering. First to Abel, and then to
his offering. The Apost^e shows the reason ^herefo^e A^els sacrifice was more
exceptable to God then Cains; saying. Heb. 11. 4.
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifi^e then Cain, by which
he obtained witness, that he wa^ righteous, God testifying of his gifts.
Because Abel had faith, and was righteous; therefore was his sacrifice accepted
of God: Abel himself pleased God, and that made his sacrifice the better to
please God. So Abraham's offering was accepted of God, because as S. I^mes
says, I^m. 2. 22. 23.
Hi^ faith wrought with his works, etc. and he was called the friend of God.
For this cause it is, that Solomon says, Pro. 15 8.
the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord; but the prayer of
the upright is his delight. Now, to the end that we our selves may please God,
and that our prayers may To which, Two things, are required.
be acceptable unto God; two things are specially required of us.

The first, is faith: for S. Paul says, Heb. 11. 6.
He that comes 1 Faith.
to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
diligently seek him. But more of this hereafter, when I come to show the
manner how we ought to pray in faith.

The Second, is repentance; for as it is necessary in every 2 Repentance. For*
Sin not repented of, hinders praye^. and that
one that prays, that he have faith to believe; so likewise, that he have
true, and unfeigned repentance of his sins past; and that he do not now live
in any known sin. For sin hinders prayer: and that whether we consider
it in general, or in particular.

First, in general, sin hinders prayer. So says the 1 In general.
Prophet Esaias, Is^. 59 2.
your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have
hid his face from you, that he will not hear. The man that was borne blind
could tell the Jews so much. I^h. 9. 31.
we know says he, That God, hears not sinners, but if any man be a worshiper
of God, and does his will, him he hears. And David says, Psa. 66. ^^.
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.

Secondly, diverse particular sins hinder Prayer: 2 In particular. As
which we must cast off, and put away far from us, if we would have the Lord
to hear our Prayers: and they are these.

The first, is Idolatry, worshipping of Idols in stead 1 Idolatry.
of the true God: Of this, the Prophet Jeremy says, Iere. 11. 13. 14
according to the number of thy Cities, were thy gods, o Judah, and according
to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that
shameful thing, even altars to burn Incense unto Baal. Therefore pray not
thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not
hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.

The second, is cruelty, unmercifulness, blood-guiltinesse. 2 Cruelty, and
unmercifulness.
Of this the Lord says, by the Prophet Esaias, Isa. 1. 15.
When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye
make many Prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. Because they
had bloody hands, and were not washed from their heinous transgressions,
therefore the Lord would not hear them.

The third, is wrath: of which the Apostle says, 1. Tim. 2. 8.
I will 3 Wrath.
therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath. He
says, without wrath, to give us to understand, that if any one come to make
his Prayer unto God, having wrath toward his neighbor, hating his brother in
his heart, the Lord will not hearken unto his Prayer.

The fourth, is vainglory: this was the fault of those 4 Vain glory.
hypocrites, of whom our Savior warns his Disciples to beware. Math. 6. 5.
When thou prayest, thou shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to
pray standing in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they
may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward. If men pray
for this end to be seen of men, and heard of men, and that they may have
praise of men, they may have the reward which they look for, men may commend
them: but they have no reward from God: their vain glory hinders the success
of their requests, and makes their prayers unacceptable to God.

The fifth, is hypocrisy: when men pray unto God fainedly, 5 Hypocrisy.
not in truth of heart. Of this the Lord complains by the Prophet Hosea,
Hos^a 7. 14.
they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their
beds: they assemble themselves for corn, and wine, and they rebel against me.
In their necessity, when they wanted corn, and wine, they cried, and wailed,
and made a pitiful noise in the ears of the Lord, but yet they lived wickedly
still, and rebelled against the Lord; they cried not to the Lord with their
heart, and therefore the Lord would not hear them.

The sixth, is want of pity and compassion, not showing 6 Want of pity and
compassion.
mercy to the poor and needy: of this Solomon says, Pro. 21. 13.
who so stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself,
but shall not be heard.

The seventh, is the wilful neglect, and contempt of the word of God: of this
also Solomon says, Pro. 28 9.
he that 7 Contempt of Gods word.
turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his Prayer shall be
abomination.

In the eight, and last place, I bring forth Ieremie's Catalogue 8 Theft,
murder, adultery, etc.
of sundry more particular sins, all hindering Prayer. Iere. 7. 9. 10.
Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn
Incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not: and come and
stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say we ar^
delivered, to do all these abominations? As if the Lord had said, What shall
it profit you to come into the Temple, to approach unto the house of prayer,
and there call upon my name, and pray for blessings, when as you are given to
stealing, to murder, to commit adultery, to swear falsely, and live in
Idolatry? All these sins are hindrances to your Prayers, and do rather
bring down curses, Before we pray to see that our hearts be purged from our
sins by Repentance.


Seeing then there are so many impediments, and hindrances of Prayer, it
behooves us every one, before we come into the presence of the Lord, to make
any Prayer unto him, to labor to have our hearts purified by faith, and purged
by repentance: to remove far from us all impediments and hindrances of
Prayer, to remove our sinne^ from before the eyes of the Lord, which stand as
a thick cloud between God and us, hindering our Prayers that they cannot
ascend up to the throne of God, and staying the blessings of God from
descending down upon us. If then thou be a worshipper of Idols, if thou
keep by thee in a secret corner, some painted or graven image, to bow down
before it; pull it down, call it from thee, away with it, if thou would
have the Lord to hear thee, when thou cryest unto him in the time of thy
trouble. If through cruelty, oppression, unmercifulness, etc. thou have
bloody hands; O wash thee, and make thee clean; lest the Lord have no delight
in thee, but hide his eyes, and deny to hear thee, though thou make many
Prayers. Take heed that thou come not before the Lord to pray unto him, having
wrath, and hatred, malice, and grudging against thy brother; lest thou provoke
the Lord to wrath against thy self. Beware of vain-glorie; lest when thou
prayest, thou go away unrewarded. And see thou purge thy heart of the leaven
of hypocrisy; lest it be laid to thy charge, that thou drawest near unto God
with thy lips, when thy heart is far from him. Further, if thou will have the
Lord to hear thy prayer, and hearken unto thy cry; see that thou turn not
thy face from any poor man, and stop not thine ears at the cry of the
distressed soul; lest the Lord stop his ears at thy cry. And if thou will
have God to hear thee when thou speak unto him by Prayer, see that thou
refuse not to hear God speaking unto thee by Preaching. For if thou make light
account of Gods word, when he speaks unto thee by Preaching; be well assured,
that God will make as light account of thy words, when thou speak unto him
by Prayer. The thief must repent of his stealing, the murderer of his blood
shed, the adulterer of his whoredom, the drunkard of his drunkenness, the
swearer of his swearing; in a word, every sinner, whosoever, and whatsoever he
be, that lives in any manner of sin, must repent of his sin, if he will
ever have the Lord to be gracious unto him, either for his soul or body. For
sin hinders prayer, and causes that God will neither regard the prayer, nor
accept the person of him that prays, till sin be removed from before the
eyes of the Lord. And this of the persons praying.

CHAP. IIII. Showing to whom we ought to pray.
THE second thing in regard of the persons 2 To whom we ought to pray.
whom prayer does conc^rne, is to whom we ought to pray.

Wherein, I will show

First, that we are to pray unto God. Secondly, that we are to pray to none
other. Thirdly, wherefore we are to direct our prayers to the true God, and to
none other besides him.
First, we are to make our prayers unto God, namely, 1 To God.
to the true God, to Jehovah, the Lord: which be manifest by these Scriptures.
Psalm. 50. 15.
Call upon me, (says the Lord) in the day of trouble. And David directs us
to whom we ought to pray, saying, Psalm. 32. 6.
For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee: that is, to the Lord.
Daniel prays on this wile: Dan. 9. 17. 18. 19.
Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, etc. And again, O
my God, incline thine ear and hear, etc. And again, O Lord hear, O Lord
forgive, O Lord hearken, and do. When our Savior taught his Disciples to
pray, he said, Luke 11. 2.
When ye pray, say, Our Father, teaching them thereby to whom they ought to
direct their prayer. And S. Paul tells us to whom he used to pray, Ephe. 3.
14.
I bow my knees unto the Father our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus it is evident by
the Scriptures, that we are to make our prayers unto God, and to call upon the
name of the Lord. And as we are to pray unto God, and to call upon the name of
the Lord. So,

Secondly, we are to make our prayers to God alone, 2 To God alone, and to none
other
and to none other: This likewise the Scripture makes manifest; David says,
Psalm. 65. 2.
O thou that hear prayer, to thee shall all flesh come. And again, Psalm.
73. 25.
Whom have I in heaven but thee? In Esaias, the Church prays thus, Isa. 63. 15.
16.
Look down from heaven, and behold, etc. Doubtless thou art our Father,
though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou O Lord
art our Father, our Redeemer, thy name is from everlasting.

The third thing yet remains; which is, to show 3 Reasons wherefore we are to
pray unto Go and to none other.
wherefore we ought to make our prayers unto God, and to him alone: The reasons
are these,

First, It is Gods commandment, bidding us to call upon him, and none other;
Psalm. 50. 15.
Call upon me, says the Lord, in the day of trouble. 1 God commands us.


Secondly, we have not only Gods commandment, bidding us call upon him, but
we have also his promise for audience: if we call upon him in our trouble, he
has 2 God promises to hear us
promised to hear us, and to deliver us out of trouble So has the Lord said,
Psalm. 50. 15.
Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, says the Lord; as if
he had said, go to none other in the time of thy trouble, neither seek thou
help and deliverance from any other but in the day of thy trouble, come unto
me, seek unto me, cry and call upon me, and I will deliver thee; for there is
none besides me that can deliver thee out of thy trouble. The Lord our God is
not like the Gods of the heathen, which have Psalm. 115. 6.
ears and hear not: he is not like to Baal, upon whom his Prophets 1 Kin.
18. 26.
called from morning even until noone, saying, O Baal, hear us, but there was
no voice, nor any that answered. To whom Elijah the Prophet of the Lord said in
derision of their God Baal; Cry alowd: for he is n Verse. 27.
a God, either he is talking, or pursuing, or he is in a journey, or
peradventure he sleeps, and must be awaked. But so is not our God whom we
worship, for our God is in heaven, and beholds the things on earth: he made
the ear, and he hears: he is neither busy in talking, nor pursuing his
enemies nor in his journey, nor yet sleeping, for Psalm. 121. 4.
he that keeps Israel, neither slumbreth nor sleeps, as says the Psalmist:
but the Psalm. 34. 15.
eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry.

Thirdly, we are sure that the Lord our God is both able, 3 God is both able
and willing to hear us.
and also willing to hear us: able; for Psalm. 94. 9.
he that planted the ear, shall he not hear? and willing; for Psalm. 145. 18.
the Lord is nigh to all that call upon him, to all that call upon him in
truth. Wherefore, I conclude, that we are to make our prayers to none other in
heaven, or in earth, but to God, and to him alone.

This serves to reprove those, who make prayers to Against those which make
prayers unto Saints. Reasons not to pray unto Saints. For,
Saints departed, and use their mediation to God for help in trouble. For,

First, it has been proved before, that God has commanded us to call upon
him in the day of trouble; but we have no commandment in all the Scripture
that enioynes us to pray to any Saint; not to S. Peter, nor to 1 Its not
commanded.
S. Paul, nor to the Virgin Marie: for that Luke. 1. 28.
Aue, hail Marie, etc. is no prayer, but a salutation of the Angel: It is no
form of prayer for us to use to the Virgin; but it was a salutation of the
Angel Gabriel, whom the Lord sent to do a message to the Virgin Marie: and
therefore not to be used of us as a prayer. And seeing that we have no warrant
in the word of God to pray unto Saints; it is a bold, and rash presumption for
us to pray unto any Saint whatsoever, though it were to the Virgin Mary. There
were certain in the days of Epiphanius, who adored the Virgin Marie, and
offered unto her. But Epiphanius judges them as heretics, and confuteth them,
saying, Reuera virgo erat ipsa virgo, and honorata: sed non ad adorationem
nobis data, verum ipsa adorans ^um, qui e^ ipsa car^e genitus, de calis vero e
sin^^ patris venerat. Epiph. co^. Collyridian.
The Virgin indeed was a Virgin, and honored: but was not given to us to be
adored; but she her self did adore him, which took flesh of her, but came
from heaven from his fathers bosom. And so we acknowledge; the Virgin is to be
honored, but not to be worshipped and adored; and therefore no prayer to be
made unto her.

Secondly, It has been proved, that if we pray unto 2 We have no promise of
help from any Saint.
to God, he promises to hear us, and to deliver us; but we have no promise in
the word of God, that any of the Saints, no not the Virgin Marie her self
will, or can, help, and deliver us in the time of our trouble.

Thirdly, the Saints departed do not know our particular 3 The Saints departed
do not know our particular wants.
wants, neither do they hearken and attend to the prayers of particular men,
as it is manifest by the prayer of the people of God, in Esaias saying, Isa. 63.
16.
Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel
acknowledge us not: thou O Lord art our Father, our Redeemer, thy name is from
everlasting. Here the people pray not to Abraham, nor to Isaak, nor to Jacob,
but to the Lord; and the reason is, because they are sure that the Lord hears
them, and remembers them; though Abraham, and Israel, that were dead, were
ignorant of them, and acknowledged them not. It is manifest then, that Abraham,
and Isaak, and Jacob, that Peter, and Paul, and the Virgin Marie, and all the
Saints departed, though they be Saints in glory; yet, because they are but
Saints, and not Gods; they are ignorant of us, they know not our particular
wants, and distresses; and it is only the Lord that is our Father, and
remembers us, and hears, and helps us in our trouble; and therefore we are
not to pray either to Abraham, or to any of the Saints, but only to the Lord,
our God, our Father, and our Redeemer.

Fourthly, we cannot pray unto Saints, but we must 4 To pray to Saints, is to
believe in them, to put trust and confidence in them.
believe in them, according to that saying of the Apostle, o How shall they
call on him, in whom they have not believed? Where, S. Paul gives us to
understand, that before we can call upon the Lord, we must first believe in
him: and so for Saints; if we call upon Saints, and x Romans 10. 14.
pray unto them to help us in our trouble, we must first believe in them, we
must put trust and confidence in them that they can help us. Now, this is
contrary to the truth of Gods word, for we are to believe in none save only
in God, neither ought we to put our trust and confidence in any, save only in
the Lord our God.

But they that maintain and use prayer to the Saints, Mediators to God,
because we acknowledge our selves to be far unworthy to come directly unto
God, but have access unto God by the mediation of Saints.

To which, I answer:

First, here is fear where no fear is: Are we afraid Psalm. 50. 15.
Call upon me in the day of trouble. And the Apostle bids us Heb. 4. 16.
come boldly unto the throne of grace.

Secondly, I confess, that by reason of our unworthiness, M^diatour? Not any
of the Saints of God, but only the mediation of the Son of God: For the
Apostle says, 1 Timothy 2. 5.
There is one God, one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
And Christ Jesus is the mediator not only of Redemption, but also of
Intercession; as S. Paul also says, Romans 8. 34.
It is Christ that dyed, yea, rather that is risen again, who is even at the
right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. And Christ himself
says, Ioh. 16. 23.
Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. S. Paul
says, that Christ is our Mediator, and he that makes intercession for us.
And Christ himself will have us to pray unto the Father in his name, promising
that whatsoever we shall ask the Father in his name, he will give it us; he
says not, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in the name of S. Peter, or S.
Paul, or in the name of the Virgin Marie, he will give it you, but in my name,
that is, in the name of Christ Jesus.

Thirdly, the ancient Fathers of the Church do not mediation of Saints. S.
Chrysostom says, A^que homines si qu ^ndo exorare oportet, and ^anitoribus
prius occur^ere c^nucnit, parasitisque histrionibusque suadere, etc. In Deo
nihil est tale. Sine mediatore exorabilis est. Chrysostom. de paenit. Hom. 4.
If a man have a su^e to (great) men, he must first meet with the Porters,
and come in by their leave, then he must speak his followers ^^ire, etc. In
God there is no such thing, he will be entreated without a mediator. And S.
Ambrose says, Ideo ad Regem per tribunos aut comites itur, quia homo vtique
est rex, etc. Ad Deu^ autem, (quem vtique nihi^ late^, omnium enim merita
nouit) promerendum, suffragatore non opu^ est, sed mente deuota Amb. in Romans 1.
We go unto the King by mediation of his Officers, his Lords and Nobles,
because the King is but a man, etc. But he that comes unto God (who knows
all things, and nothing is hid from him) has no need of any one to speak for
him, to do him a pleasure, but only a devout mind. To conclude, seeing that
the dead are ignorant of us, and our affairs; seeing that the dead know not
what the living do; and seeing that it is altogether uncertain, and
doubtful, whether the Saints departed hear us; and that it is most certain,
and without all doubt, that the Lord our God hears us, and knows what
things we have need of; Why then should we pray unto Saints? And wherefore is
it, that men will be so blinded, to choose rather that which is uncertain,
then to hold fast and stick to that which is certain? Doubtless the Lord is
our God, and will hear us: Our Father, and knows what things we have need
of: Our Redeemer, and will help and deliver us; though Abraham be ignorant of
us, and though Israel, and the Saints departed acknowledge us not.

CHAP. V. Showing for whom we ought to pray; and First, of praying for The
Living.
TO whom we ought to pray, has been declared:

The third thing in regard of the persons 3 For whom we are to pray. Two sorts.
whom prayer concerns is, for whom we are to pray. And they are of two sorts:
for we are to pray

or soul: as David prays, 2 Particularly.

First, affirmatively, in regard of the living, for whom 1 For the living.
we are to pray. Secondly, negatiuely, in regard of the dead, for whom we are
not to pray. Twofold.

First: we are to pray for the living; and that either. 1 Generally, For all.

Generally, for all, or
Particularly for some certain persons.
For the First: We are to make prayers for all: which the Apostle exhorts
unto, saying, 1 Timothy 2. 1.
I exhort therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,
and giving of thanks be made for all men.

What? must we pray for all men? for wicked, and ungodly men? yea, for all; for
all of all sorts; for wicked and Forsitan aliqua fiet eorum mutatio Chrysostom. a^
pop. Antio. Hom. 69.
It may be they may be changed, and altered from their euil^ course of life.
They that are now bad may become good. We are to pray for evil men then, that
they may be amended: we are to pray for good men also, that they may be
bettered: and for those that are amended, and bettered, that they may persevere
and continue in their goodness.

But the Lord forbids Jeremy the prophet to pray for Jer. 11. 14.
Pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I
will not hear them etc. And S. John says, 1 John 5. 16.
If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, be shall
ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death, there is a
sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. I answer, we may,
and ought Jeremy must not pray; namely, such as were obdurate, and whose
hearts were hardened that they would not return. Or if they be not such, who
through Apostasy fall away wholly from God, and the known truth; and so of
Christian professors, become professed aduersarie^ to the truth: for which, S.
John will not have us to pray, because they sin unto death: In a word then,
we are to pray for all men, as Saint Paul exhorts us, yea, were they never so
wicked, as long as there is any hope of their amendment, and as long as they 2

do not sin unto death. Thus in general, we are to pray for all.

Secondly, we are to pray in particular, for diverse 1 For kings, and all that

sorts of persons and people.

First, for Kings: for rulers and governors of the land, for Magistrates and
for all that are in authority This the Apostle teaches us, laying, 1. Tim. 2.
1. 2.
I exhort therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,
and giving of thanks be made for all men: for Kings, and for all that are in
authority.

And there is great reason to persuade us to pray for For
Kings, and for all that are in authority; for

in S. Paul's exhortation formerly mentioned.

Secondly, By the King, and through the good rulers 2 By the King, and good
Rulers, we receive much good.
and governors of the Land, we receive much good: By the King, we have peace
and quietness in our Land; By the King, we enjoy the inestimable benefit of
the Gospel in our coasts: By the rulers of the Land, and those that are in
authority, we have the execution of good laws; and by them, transgressors of
the Law are punished; and by their punishments, others are warned: so that
quiet minded men, may walk in their callings without fear, and lead a quiet
and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty.

First, then we are to pray for Kings, and for all that are in authority.

Secondly, we are to pray for the City, the town, and 2 For the City, and
place of our dwelling.
place where we inhabit and dwell, as the captive Jews living in Babylon,
were commanded to do; Jere. 29. 7.
Secke the peace of the city, whither I have caused you to be carried away
captive, and pray unto the Lord for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have
peace. The Jews at this time, were in a strange Land, in bondage to another
Nation, and yet the Lord appoints them to pray for the good and prosperous
estate of the city where they dwelt.

Thirdly, we are all bound to pray for the state of the 3 For the church of God.
Church of God militant here on earth: this is David's exhortation: Psalm. 122. 6.
pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they shall prosper that love thee. And David
himself prays, saying, Psalm. 51. 18.
Do good unto Sion.

Fourthly, we are bound to pray for all that are in need, in want, and
distress; in affliction and misery; in sickness, or pain: in perfecution,
or tentation. When S. For all that are afflicted.
Peter was in affliction, and distress, when he was persecuted, and cast into
Prison, Act. 12. 5.
Prayer was made without ceasing of the Church unto God for him. And Saint
James teaches us, to pray for the sick and diseased. Iam. 5. 14. 15. 16.
Is any sick among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let
them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the
Prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up: and
again, he says, pray one for another, that ye may be healed.

Lastly, we are bound to pray for our enemies: this our 5 For our enenemies.
Savior Christ teaches us; saying, Mat. 5. 44.
love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,
and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you: and this is
not only the precept of our Savior Christ, but also his practice: for at his
passion and suffering, he prayed, saying, Luke 23. 34.
father forgive them: So does St Steven pray for his persecutours; saying, Act.
7. 60.
Lord lay not this sin to their charge.

The consideration of this, that we are to pray for others; To pray for the
Kings Majesty with a stee heart, and willing mind.
may teach us, that it is our bounden duty, with an open heart, with a willing
mind, and free voice, to pray unto God for our Sovereign Lord the KING, for
the most Noble and Illustrious PRINCE, and Princely progeny. The captive Jews
obtain license of King Darius to go to Jerusalem, and to build the house o^
God, that they might offer sacrifices unto the God of Heaven, Ezr. 6. 10.
and pray for the life of the King and of his sons. In Turtullian's time, the
Christians were slanderously reproached, that they did not houour the Emperor,
but were enemies to the State: to which, the Father making an Apology for the
Christians, answers, showing that Christians did pray for the Emperors, for
they Vitam ill^^ prolixam, imp^rtum securum, d^mum tutam, exercitus fortes,
senatum fidelem, populum probum, etc. precantes. Tertul. Apolog.
prayed that God would give them a long life, a secure Empire, a safe house,
strong armies, a faithful Senate, a good People, etc. Now these Kings and
Emperors, were heathenish, and persecutours of Christians, and yet they prayed
for them; how much more then are we, O England; bound to praise the God of
Heaven, for giving us so wise, so learned, so religious a King, so powerful a
defender of the Faith, and so great a maintainer of the Gospel of Christ! And
we are not only bound to bless and praise God for the manifold blessings
wherewith the Lord our God blesses us in our Sovereign Lord the King; but
also to pray earnestly unto the Lord, for the preservation and prosperity of
our King; that in his safety, we may have safety: in his prosperity, we may
have prosperity: and in his peace, we may have peace.

Secondly, whereas we are bound (as has bin proved) Against those that will
not pray for their enemies.
for all men; yea, for our enemies; this serves to reprove those, who, although
it may be, they may pray for their friends; yet bear such a grudge and hatred
to their enemies, that they will in no case be persuaded to pray for them. But
consider o man whosoever thou art, that can not pray for thine enemies,
Christ commands thee to pray for thine enemies; obey him. Yea Christ himself
prayed for his enemies, to give thee an example of praying for thine enemies;
imitate thou him. Or if thou think it hard to imitate Christ the Lord, in a
matter so hard to flesh and blood; then imitate Steven the servant of Christ,
who imitated his Lord and Master Christ, in praying for his enemies. For as
Christ said concerning his enemies, Father forgive them; so Steven said
concerning his enemies, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. Mat. 5. 46.
If ye love them which love you, what reward have you? Do not even the
Publicans the same? It Is a small matter for a man to love one that loves him
again; and to wish well to him, that wishes well to him again: this very
Publicanes can do, any man may do this. But he is a worthy Christian, he is
a good man indeed, that can love his enemies, that can wish well to him, that
wishes no good to him again: and that can pray for his enemies: such men are
rare on earth: few such are to be found: and yet we ought so to strive against
our inward corruptions, against our anger, and hatred, and desire of revenge,
that we might both forgive our enemies, and pray for our enemies, if we will be
the followers of Christ, and the children of our heavenly Father.

CHAP. VI. Of praying for the dead.
HItherto has been showed, that we are to pray 2 Not for the dead. And
Therein three things.
for the living: It remains in the second place, to entreat of Prayer for
the dead: And therein I will show,

First, how the present Romish Church holds, and maintains Prayer for the
dead. Secondly, I will declare, in what sense, the ancient Fathers have
mentioned, and they themselves sometimes used Prayer for the dead. Thirdly, I
will use reasons to dissuade all men from praying for the dead, as the Romists
do.
For the first; Bellarm. de Purgator.
Cardinal Bellarmine gives us a clear 1 How the present Romish Church
holds and maintains Prayer for the dead.
light to know how, and in what sense, the present Romish Church holds and
maintains Prayer for the dead: for he tells us that there are three places of
receptacle, Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory, (besides his feigned Limbus) for
three sorts of people departing hence, that is to say the just and righteous
ones: the wicked and ungod ly; and they that are of a middle sort, believers;
but yet such as are not thoroughly cleansed from their sins. As for the just
and righteous, he doubts not but their souls go straight to Paradise, to
Heaven; as the souls of the Apostles, Martyrs, etc. As for the wicked and
ungodly, impenitent sinners, and Infidels* he makes no question of them, but
that they go down to Hell, never to be delivered. All the question is, of the
third sort; those of the middle sort, which are neither very good, nor very
evil; but such as die in their venial sins, or have not satisfied for the
temporal punishment of their mortal sins; and therefore such must be cast
into the fire of Purgatory, to purge them more from their sins, and as it were
to scour away their dross, till they have satisfied the justice of God,
partly by their own sufferings; and partly by the prayers, fastings,
almesdeeds of others, and such like. This is the Faith of the present Roman
Church concerning Prayer for the dead: so that the prayers of the Romists which
they make for the dead, are chiefly intended for the souls of their friends
in Purgatory; that thereby they may procure some mitigation of their pains,
and bring (as they imagine) some ease to their tormented souls.

The second thing concerning Prayer for the dead, is, 2 In what sense the
ancient Fathers have mentioned, and sometimes used prayer for the dead.
to show in what sense the ancient Fathers have mentioned in their writings,
and sometimes, used themselves, Prayer for the dead. Diverse judicious, and
learned D. Mort. in his Protest. Appeal. l. 2. c. 8. Lanch. de natura Dei. l.
4. c. 4. Perk probl^m. ^itul. pr^s. promort.
Divines consent in this; that the ancient Orthodoxall Fathers never used, or
spoke of Prayers for the dead, to the end, that they might have remission of
their sins after this life, that they might be purged from their sins, or
be delivered from the pains of Purgatory: but the Prayers made for the dead
in ancient time, were for other ends: and chiefly, they were either praises
and thankesgiuings to God for their departure out of this miserable, sinful,
and wretched life; and forgiving them eternal life in the heavens: or else,
they were Prayers made in regard of the Resurrection of their bodies; that the
Lord would send them a speedy, and joyful Resurrection: and these Prayers
which were made for their friends departed, were not made in regard of any
misery of the present state of their souls, but for the glorifiing of their
bodies in the Resurrection of the just; that then their glory might be
increased, and that they might receive fulness of glory both in their
bodies, and in their souls. And this is not a mere opinion, and bare
conjecture; but this is according to sound judgment; gathered from the
writings of the Fathers themselves. St Ambrose prays for the Emperor
Theodosius after his death, saying, Darequiem perfectam seruo tuo Theodosi^,
requiem quam praeparasti sanctis tuis. Amb. orat. funeb. de obit. The dos.
Give perfect rest to thy servant Theodosius, even that rest which thou have
prepared for thy Saints. Thus he prays, and yet afterward, says, Manet in
lumine Theodosius, and sanctorum caetibus gloriatur, ibid.
Theodosius is in light, and is glorified amongst the company of the Saints. So
St Lib Confess.
Austine prays for his Mother being dead, and yet is persuaded that the Lord
has heard him, and granted his request, and that she is in glory. So
Eusebius reports, that Preces pro auima Imperatoris Deo fundebant. Eusebius. de
vita Constant. l. 4. cap. 71.
Prayers were made for Constantine the Christian-Emperour after his death:
which prayers were but either thankesgiuings, lauding, and praising God for
delivering him out of this miserable life, and crowning him with glory in the
heavens; or prayers for the fullness of glory in the Resurrection of the just;
and they did not pray for any ease to his soul, from the flames of Purgatory,
for (as the same Author reports) Omnes beatum Imperatorem, acceptumque Deo
praedicabant. ibid. c. 69.
all men did say that the Emperor was blessed, and accepted of God. It is
manifest then, by these Fathers, that the custom of the ancient Church of God
in praying for the dead, was not to procure ease, and to bring refreshing to
their souls in Purgatory, or to deliver them out of Purgatory; seeing that
they acknowledge, that their friends for whom they prayed, were in light; were
in glory; and were blessed. 3 Reasons wherefore we are not to pray for the
dead, as the Papists do at this day.


In the third place, I yield these reasons, wherefore we are not to pray for
the dead, as the Romists use Prayer for the dead at this day.

First, The Scripture acknowledges but two places, as receptacles for the
souls of men after this life, Heaven and Hell: either to be with h Dives in
hell torments, 1 The Scripture acknowledges but two places after this life.
or with Lazarus in Abraham's bosom, that is, in joy and felicity: now they
that are in heaven, are in so great joys already, that they cannot be
bettered, till the day of the resurrection, when they shall have fullness of
glory both in body and soul: and they that are in hell, cannot by Luke 16.
22. 23
any prayers be delivered thence; as Abraham tells Dives, Ver. 26.
between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that they which would
pass from hence to you, cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come
from thence. From Hell there is no redemption.

Secondly, whereas the Romish Church teaches, and 2 All the faithful and true
believers are cleansed from their sins in this life.
holds, that they that are cast into Purgatory, are of the faithful sort,
believers; the Scripture proves that all the faithful, all true believers
are washed and cleansed from their sins in this life, and are therefore
blessed after this life: For S John says, 1. Ioh. 1. 7.
the blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanses us from all sin. St Paul
says, Romans 8. 1.
there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. Christ himself
says, Ioh. 5. 24.
He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting
life, and shall not come into condemnation: but is passed from death unto life.
And a voice from heaven says unto John, Reu. 14. 13.
Write, blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, says
the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow
them. Now, seeing that the state of the faithful believers, is such, that they
are cleansed, and purified from their sins in the blood of Christ; seeing
there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ; seeing they that believe
in Christ, shall not come into condemnation, but pass from death to life; and
seeing that all the faithful are blessed when they die, and their works
follow them, that is, they have the reward of their works; then it is evident,
that they go not to any place of torment, before they come to heaven; but upon
their dissolution, they ascend to heaven, and are with Christ. 3 The canonical
Scripture does not mention prayer for the dead.


Thirdly, the Canonical Scripture does not so much as mention Prayer for the
dead; no, not in those places where there is mention of sacrifices and prayer;
yea, mention of the death of the righteous: but rather the contrary. S. Paul
to the Thessalonians says, 1. These. 4. 13.
I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are
asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as other, which have no hope. Where, the
Apostle gives us to understand, that if our friends departed, were in any
place of torment, if they were in pain and misery, then indeed, we had cause
to sorrow and mourn, to pray, and to do any thing that might procure them
ease; but says the Apostle, I would not have you to sorrow as men without
hope; as if he had said, If you have hope, that your friends departed are at
rest. have ease, and shall rise again to glory; why then do you sorrow for
them as they that have no hope, either of their present rest, or future
Resurrection to glory? you should rather rejoice, for that they are at rest.

Fourthly, though it cannot be denied, but that Prayer 4 Prayer for the dead,
though it be ancient, yet is it neither Apostolical; nor yet used by the most
ancient, orthodoxall Fathers of the Church, as it is by the Romists at this
day.
for the dead is an ancient custom, long used in the Church: yet
notwithstanding, I say,

First, that it comes short of that antiquity, to be an Apostolical
doctrine. For, before Tertul. de coro. mil.
Turtullians time, there is little or no mention of Prayer for the dead: and he
himself acknowledges, that it has no firm foundation in the Scriptures, but
only from Tradition and custom.

Secondly, the ancient Fathers did not use Prayer for the dead, as the Romish
Church does use it at this day: namely, for the easing of souls in Purgatory,
and to deliver them from thence; but for other ends, as has bin sufficiently
declared before: And the ancient Fathers, (if they be rightly understood) do
nothing at all confirm the doctrine of the present Romish Church, concerning
their manner of praying for the dead.

The consideration hereof, serves

First, to reprove those, who when they speak of their Against those that pray
for mercy to the souls of their friends departed.
friend, departed, pray that God would have mercy on their souls; for
although, the Prayers of the ancient Church for the souls of the dead, might
receive some tolerable interpretation before Purgatory was believed; yet now,
since that the Romish Church has devised a Purgatory, and that it is held
amongst them as an article of faith; it is dangerous to make such a Prayer. For
this kind of Prayer that God would have mercy on his soul, howsoever it may
demonstrate the affection of him that prays for his friend departed; yet may
it be offensive two ways:

First, by taking Gods name in vain, through a too frequent, and common using
of it in ordinary communication; as the manner of some is.

Secondly, by an opinion of supposing his friend to be in Purgatory: for in
praying for mercy to his soul, he supposes, (or at least, breeds an opinion
in the minds of the hearers, that he does suppose) that the soul of his
friend departed, is in the pains of Purgatory, and has need of mercy to be
showed to his soul: whereas it is certain, that the faithful departed out of
this life, have obtained mercy before they yield up the Ghost, and they are
purged and cleansed from their sins in the blood of Jesus Christ.

Secondly, hence we learn, that although it be unlawful It is no superstition
to laud and praise God for the departure of our Christian friends.
ease, in, or delivery out of Purgatory; yet it is no superstition, to laud
and praise God for the departure of our Christian friends out of the miseries
of this mortal life: nor yet, to wish to us, and them in general, the
hastening of Christ's second coming to judgment; that we with them, and they
with us, may have a glorious Resurrection, and enjoy perfect blessedness both
in body and soul. For Perk. Cathol. reform. de Purgator.
this is included in that Petition, Mat. 6. 10.
Thy kingdom come. And this is that sweet, and pleasant voice of the
Bridegroom, Christ Jesus, and of the Bride, the spouse of Christ, the Church
of God, and every faithful soul, Reu. 22. 20.
Surely, I come quickly. Amen. Euenso, come Lord Jesus.

CHAP. VII. Of the matter of Prayer: showing for what things we are to pray.
Having entreated of the persons whom Prayer 4 The subject, matter of Prayer.
Twofold.
does concern; the next, which is the fourth thing in the Treatise of Prayer,
is the subject matter of prayer: and it is twofold: for it is concerning such
things, for which we are either

To pray to God: or,

To praise God.

For the Scripture, as it teaches us how they ought to be qualified that do
pray; and directs us both to whom we must pray, and for whom: so also it
shows us for what we are to pray, as also how to praise God for blessings and
benefits received.

First, of the things for which we are to pray: and they 1 Things for which we
are to pray. Twofold.
are to be considered; either

Generally, or

Particularly.

First, in general; we are to pray for lawful things: for 1 In general: for
lawful things.
such things as we may lawfully request at Gods hands. S. James has this
saying, Iam. 4. 3. For we may pray amiss; Two ways.
Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss: by which words of the
Apostle, it is evident, that a man may pray, and pray amiss: and a man may
ask amiss two manner of ways.

First, When he asks, and prays for unlawful things: Secondly, When he
asks, and prays for lawful things, but unlawfully, and after an unlawful
manner.
First, they ask and pray amiss, who ask and pray 1 Asking unlawful things.
for unlawful things. As did the Israelites in asking them a King: they come
to Samuel, and say unto him, 1 Samuel 8. 5.
Make us a King to judge us, like all the Nations. But it is said, Verse 6.
the thing displeased Samuel. And its further said, that Samuel prayed unto the
Lord concerning this matter, and the answer of the Lord was this: V^rse 7.
Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they shall say unto thee; for
they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not
reign over them. They made a petition for a King to rule over them, when as
the Lord God was their King. But their request was unlawful, and displeasing
unto the Lord. Such an unlawful request was that which the mother of Zebedees
children made unto Christ, saying, Mat. 20. 20. 21
Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the
other on the left in thy Kingdom. How unlawful this request was, may be
gathered from the answer of Christ, Verse 22.
Ye know not what ye ask. First then, we may ask amiss, asking unlawful
things:

Secondly, we may ask lawful things, and yet ask 2 Asking lawful things
unlawfully. Two ways.
unlawfully, after an unlawful manner, and so ask amiss, and that two ways:

First, in not asking according to the will of God. S. John says, 1 Ioh. 5. 14.
This is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing
according to his will, he hears us. In 1 Not asking according to the will of
God.
our prayers, we are not to consider so much what we desire, and what we would
have granted us, as whether that which we desire, be a thing wel-pleasing unto
God, and be according to his will.

Secondly, we may ask lawful things unlawfully, and 2 Asking good things to
an evil end.
so ask amiss, asking good things to an evil end. As when men pray for goods
and substance, ask wealth and riches, to waste and consume with riotous
living. Of this, S. James says, James 3. 4.
Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon
your lusts. And this, of the things which we are to pray for in general.

Secondly, in particular, the things which we are to 2 In particular.
pray for, are of two sorts. For

First, we are to pray against evil things. Twofold.


Secondly, for the obtaining of good things. Both which are set down by the
Apostle S. Paul to Timothy, saying, 1 Timothy 2. 1.
I exhort therefore that first of all, supplications, prayers, etc. be made:
the first, is expressed in the word, supplications: the later, in the word,
prayers.

For the first; Supplications are such prayers as are made 1 Supplications.
Against evil things. Twofold.
against evils, which either do, or may befall us. And these Supplications
stand in these two things.

First, that we may be freed from the evil of our former sins. Secondly,
that we may delivered from the evil of the punishment for sin.
First, Supplications made against the evil of sin, are 1 Against the evil
of sin.
those prayers which we make to move the Lord, through the humble
acknowledgement and confession of our sins, to be merciful unto us to
forgive us our sins, to pardon our offenses, and to remove our sins from
us. So our Savior Christ teaches us to pray, Math. 6. 12.
forgive us our trespasses.

For the second kind of Supplications, which are made 2 Against the evil of
punishment. Threefold.
against the evil of the punishment for sin: these are threefold. For
either we pray that the evil may be auerted, and turned away from us before it
fall; or that it may be removed and taken away; or that it may be mittigated
and assuaged.

First, in regard of evils that may befall us; we may 1 To turn away evils.
and ought to make supplications, that the Lord would of his mercy auert, and
turn them away from us. For so our Savior Christ himself prays, Math. 26.
39.
O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.

Secondly, concerning evils that are fallen upon us; 2 To remove evils.
we may make supplications, that the Lord of his mercy would remove them, and
take them away from us, and that he would deliver us out of our trouble; as
David in his sickness prays, Psalm. 6. 2.
O Lord heal me, for my bones are vexed. And again, he prays, Psalm. 25. 22.
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

Thirdly, concerning evils of punishment, and afflictions, 3 To mitigate and
assuage evils.
we may make supplications, that the Lord would mittigate and assuage them: so
Job supplicates some ease, and some mittigation of his pain: saying, Joh 7. 19.
How long will thou not depart from me? nor let me alone till I swallow down
my spettle? And this of Supplications.

The second sort of Prayers, are made for the obtaining 2 Prayers forth
obtaining of good things.
of good things: and they are called petitions, precations, requests, and by a
general name, Prayers: which are such prayers, whereby, we do beseech and
entreat the Lord to bestow some good thing upon us; either, some temporal
blessing for this present life; or some grace needful for our souls health;
or an eternal blessing for the life to come. As when we pray for food and
raiment, and things needful for the preservation of this life: when we pray
for repentance, for faith, hope and charity, for patience, humility, etc. When
we pray for the enlarging of Christ's kingdom; for increase of Rules in praying
for temporal and spiritual things.
grace, and eternal life. Concerning which, these rules are to be held.

First, Spiritual and heavenly things may be prayed 1 Spiritual things are to
be prayed for (...) simply: temporal things (...) with condition.
for, and asked at Gods hands simply, absolutely, and without condition: but
corporal blessings, and temporal benefits must be asked, and prayed for in
respect and regard of something else, and conditionally: namely, if God will,
and if it be good, and profitable for us. So the Leper prayed, Math. 8. 2.
Lord, if thou will, thou can make me clean. I know Lord, thou can make
me clean, if it be thy will so to do. 2 In temporal things we must be
content with things necessary, not ^^auing superfluity: but in spiritual
things we are not limited.


Secondly, concerning temporal things we must not pray for superfluity, but
only for things necessary: so Agur prays, Prou. 30. 8.
Give me neither poverty, nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me.
But in spiritual things, there is neither condition, nor limitation. For we may
pray, that we may Colos. 1. 10.
increase in the knowledge of God: that we may 1 These. 4. 1.
abound more and more in grace and goodness: and that we may be Phil. 1. 11.
filled with the fruits of righteousness.

This is profitable for our information in the matter of Prayer; and that

First, to discern aright what manner of prayers we supplications, or
petitions; whether 1 To discern what manner of prayers we make.
they be prayers and requests made against evils, to be auerted, removed, or
mittigated; or whether they be prayers made for the obtaining of any blessing,
and benefit, either for soul or body; that so we may have a feeling and
understanding of what we pray for.

Secondly, to consider well with our selves, before we 2 To consider whether
the things that we pray for be lawful.
pray, what things we pray for: whether they be things lawful or unlawful:
whether they be pleasing or displeasing unto God: and whether they be agreeable
to the will of God, or not.

Thirdly, that we discern and put difference between 3 To put difference
between temporal blessings and spiri^all graces.
temporal blessings, and spiritual graces: If we crave temporal things, not
to be greedy of to much, but to be content with things necessary: and to
refer the success of obtaining the things we desire, to Gods will; because
he knows better what is good for us, then we our selves: And for spiritual
graces, to crave them absolutely; for gifts of grace are absolutely necessary
to salvation.

CHAP. VIII. Of Thanksgiving.
WHat we are to pray for, has been showed:

The second thing in the matter of 2 Thanksgiving and praising God for his
benefits.
Prayer, is, of praising God, and giving him thanks for the benefits received:
Which kind of p^ayers the Apostle calls giving of thanks, or thanksgiving.
1 Timothy 2. 1.
I exhort, says he, that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions,
and giving of thanks be made for all men. Now concerning Thanksgiving, I will
show

First, how many ways we may, and are bound, to give God thanks and praise:
Therein, two things.
Secondly, the reasons which may move and persuade us to thanksgiving.
For the first: Thanksgiving is three fold: Or, three 1 How many ways we may
praise God. Three ways.
manner of ways we may, and ought to show our thankfulness unto God.

The first is
with the heart. 2 with the tongue. 3 by our deeds.
First, We are to show our thankfulness unto God 1 With the heart.
with the heart: we must praise God with our heart, and with all our heart:
with our soul, and all that is within us: so David teaches us by his own
example, saying, Psalm. 86. 12.
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: And again, Psalm. 103. 1.
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.

Secondly, We are to bless and praise God with the 2 With the tongue.
tongue, and mouth; our lips must show forth his praise: our mouth must be
filled with his praise; and our tongue must sing of his praise. When the Lord
had brought the children of Israel through the red sea on dry ground, and had
overthrown the Aegiptians in the midst of the sea, Exodus 15. 1.
Then sang Moses and the children of Israel a song of thanksgiving unto the
Lord. So Judge. 5. 1. 2.
Deborah and Barak sang a song of thanksgiving. Praising God for their
deliverance from Sisera. And David often in his Psalms praises God, and
stirs up others to praise God for blessings, and for deliverances. For this
cause, praises and thanksgiuings are called by the Prophet Hosea, Hos. 14. 2.
The calves of our lips. Signifying thereby, that the Lord our God is more
delighted with the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, then with the killing
of oxen, or shedding the blood of Calves.

Thirdly, there is a thanksgiving to God, and a prayfing 3 By our deeds and
works.
of God by our deeds and works: Our very life and conversation may bring
praise and glory to Gods name according to that saying of our Savior Christ,
Math. 5. 16.
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
glorify your father which is in heaven. And this praising and glorifying of
God by our deeds and works, is twofold.

First, by our good works, holy life, and godly conversation, Twofold.
we edefie others, we incite and stir up others 1 Edifying others and
provoking them to do good by our good example.
to goodness: our good example prouokes, and draws on others to do good, to
the praise and glory of God: this was the commendation of the Church of Corinth
for their forwardness in contributing to the necessity of the distressed
Saints; for the Apostle says, 2 Cor. 9 2.
Your zeal has provoked very many.

Secondly, they that live well, are an example of virtue, 2 Our godly life is a
means to convert the wicked, and being converted, to glorify God.
and goodness to them that are vicious and wicked, and as yet unconverted: the
godly life of the righteous is as a light shining unto them that walk in the
ways of wickedness, to provoke them, if at any time God would open their
eyes, that they might turn from darkness to light, and from Satan to God.
Wherefore, S. Peter gives this exhortation, 1 Pet. 2. 12.
Having your conversation honest among the gentiles, that whereas they speak
against you as evil doers, they may by your good works which they shall
behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. After this manner, we are to
praise God, and to testify our thankfulness 2 Reasons to persuade to
thanksgiving.
unto God for his benefits, and for all his goodness, and mercies toward us.
In the second place, I am to use reasons to persuade to this duty of
thanksgiving; and they are these:

First, The Scripture exhorts to it: saying, Psalm. 50. 14. 15.
Offer 1 The Scripture exhorts to it.
unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy vows to the most high, and call upon me in
the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me. Again,
the Psalmist exhorts those that are delivered from diverse calamities, and
afflictions l Psalm. 107. 8.
to praise the Lord, saying, k O that men would praise the Lord for his
goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men. So the Apostle
exhorts, saying, Coloss 3. 17.
Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
giving thanks to God and the Father, by him.

Secondly, Examples of good men may move us to 2 Good men have practiced it.
imitate them in their thankfulness to God: David in sundry Psalms praises
God saying in one place, Psalm. 103. 1. 2.
Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me bless his holy name.
Bless the Lord O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. And again he
says, Psalm. 116. 12. 13.
What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me? I will take
the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. And again he says,
Ver. 17.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the
name of the Lord. Hezekiah prayseth God after that he was recovered of his
sickness: saying, Isa. 38. 19.
the living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to
the children shall make known thy truth. When our Savior Christ had restored
a blind man to his sight, it is said, that he Luke 18. 43.
followed him, glorifying God: and all the people when they saw it, gave praise
unto God.

Thirdly, the Creatures may teach us thankfulness, 3 The very creatures in
their kind, do praise God.
and move us to praise God: for the very Creatures in their kind, and
manner, do praise God, and obey his will: the Sun keeps his course, and
the Moon observes her seasons, her full, and change: as says the Psalmist,
Psalm. 104. 19.
He appointed the Moon for seasons; the Sun knows his going down. The
birds and feathered fowls praise God in singing, and keeping their time: as
says the Prophet Jeremy, Iere. 8. 7.
the Storke in the heaven knows her appointed times, and the turtle, and the
crane, and the swallow observe the time of their coming; the Psalm. 33. 9.
earth stands fast as God has commanded; neither is it Psalm. 104. 5.
removed for ever. And the sea over flows not the banks, which God has set
to keep it in, as it is also said of the great and deep waters of the Sea,
Ver. 9.
thou have set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again
to cover the earth. And the Creatures do not only iustruct us in this duty
of thankfulness to God, by their obedience; but the creatures which we have
the use and benefit of, for food, and raiment, and other necessary uses, do
as is observed, teach us our duty of thankfulness unto God, in three words,
Accipe, r^dde, cave: accipe beneficium, read debitum, cave (nisi reddideri^)
supplicium. Ludon. Granat. lib. 1. par. 1.
receive, restore, beware: that is, receive this benefit and blessing from God:
restore unto God that which is due, render him thanks, and praise for it: and
take heed, beware of punishment, if thou be unthankful unto God for his
benefits.

Fourthly, Thanksgiving and praising God for benefits received, is profitable
unto us: For first, to praise God for benefits received, is a means to
preserve and 4 It is profitable for us to praise God: for
continue those blessings which we have already received: God is pleased to
bless his blessings unto us, because we bless, and praise him for his
blessings.

Secondly, thanksgiving to God for former blessings, 1 To praise God for
blessings received, is a means to preserve, and bless them unto us.
is a means to procure more blessings, yea, increase of blessings; as it was
said to that servant that had gained five talents; Mat. 25. 21.
well done, thou good and faithful servant, thou have been faithful over a
few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: so he that is thankful
to God for the gifts and graces which he has already received, and uses 2 To
praise God for former blessings, is a meants to procure more blessings.
them well, shall have not only the same continued, but likewise more gifts,
and more graces added.

Now, seeing that thanksgiving is a duty commanded; seeing that good men
have practiced the same; yea, seeing that the very creatures do stir us up
to thankfulness; and seeing that it is so profitable unto us: The
consideration hereof, serves greatly to reprove all those, Against those which
are unthankful unto God, for benefits received.
amongst men, it is a hateful thing for a man to prove unthankful: and its a
grievous thing for a man to do well to him that will never give him thanks:
much more odious, and hateful a thing it is for us to be unthankful unto our
God, for all his benefits: it is a grievous thing to the Lord, to see us daily
receive his blessings, and not lift up our hearts, nor open our mouths to
praise the Lord, and give him thanks. And they are to be reckoned in the
number of unthankful people, who having received blessings from the God of
heaven, do daily sin against him; who, in stead of opening their mouths to
praise God, do open their mouths wide to blaspheme God; and in stead of
serving the Lord in holiness and righteousness all the days of their life, do
spend all, or most part of their days, in ungodliness, and unrighteousness.
This was the great plea that the Lord had against Israel, Isa. 1. 2. 3.
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord has spoken: I have
nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. The Ox
knows his owner, and the Ass his Masters crib: but Israel does not know, my
people does not consider. One of those ^enne Lepers which came to Christ to be
cleansed, has his praise, for that perceiving himself healed, he Luke 17.
15. 16
turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face
at his feet, giving him thanks. But the other nine which returned not to give
God thanks, are justly reproved by our Savior, Ver. 17.
were there not ten cleansed, but where are the nine? Certainly, if we do
well weigh, and seriously consider the great blessings and unspeakable
benefits of almighty God toward us sinful men, there is none but only a
very unthankful man, that will not be moved, with heart, and voice to praise
God, and to express his thankfulness by holy obedience in his life and
conversation: for we cannot but confess; that the Lord did at the first create
man in his Genesis 1. 27.
own image, and when as through the sin and transgression of our first
parents, we had brought upon our selves misery, death, and damnation, except
some remedy were found out, for our restoration and salvation: then Ephe. 2 4.
God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, sent us a
Mat. 1. 21.
Savior, even 1. Joh. 4. 9.
his only begotten Son, that we might live through him. And that we might
have Romans 3. 24.
redemption through Jesus Christ: which redemption was wrought by the death of
Christ, and the shedding of his most precious blood, as St Peter witnesses,
saying, 1. Pet. 1. 18. 19.
ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your
vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the
precious blood of Christ: so great was our offense, and so heinous our
transgression, that it cost the precious blood of Christ to redeem our souls.
It is the Lord our God that first formed us in our mothers womb; he brought us
to light, he has preserved our lives since our birth; he it is, that daily,
and yearly provides for us food and raiment, and things necessarue for this
present life; he it is, that gives us health, and strength of body; he it is,
that has and does deliver us from many perils and dangers, and preserves us
from our enemies, both corporal and spiritual; yea, he it is, that gives us
food for our souls, the bread of life; that gives us habitation on earth,
and has Joh. 14. 2.
prepared for us mansions and dwelling places in heaven. In a word, he has
given us his Son, and with him all things: as says the Apostle, Romans 8. 42.
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all: how shall
he not with him also freely give us all things? Now, what shall we render unto
the Lord for all these his benefits done unto us? Shall we recompense him with
unthankfulness? Shall we requite him with undutifulness, disobedience, and
rebellion? And shall we reward evil for good? O ingratitude! nay rather, let
us render him the calves of our lips. Let us take the cup of salvation, and
call upon the name of the Lord: and let us offer to the Lord the sacrifice of
thanksgiving.

CHAP. IX. Of the Time of Prayer.
THe fifth thing in the Treatise of Prayer, is concerning 5 The time of Prayer.
the Time of Prayer: when, and at what times, we are to make supplications,
prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks unto God.

The time of Prayer, I consider two ways: Considered two ways.


First, in regard of the present day. 1 in regard of the present day.
Secondly, in regard of the present need.
For the first: Every day must have his time of Prayer: The Lord requires at
our hands prayer every day: and I find that holy men of God, religious and
devout men, the servants of the Lord have used to pray often in the day; some
more, and some less times in the day. In the old Testament, the Priests
offered sacrifice twice a day, morning and evening; as the Lord gave
commandment, Exodus 29. 38. 39.
Now this is that which thou shall offer upon the Altar; two lambs of the
first year, day by day continually. The one lamb thou shall offer in the
morning, and the other lamb thou shall offer at even. And they used to burn
Incense twice a day, morning and evening: as the Lord also appointed. Exodus 30.
7. 8.
And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet Incense every morning; when he dresseth
the Lamps he shall burn Incense upon it. And when Aaron lights the Lamps
at even, he shall burn Incense upon it. Now, the devout prayers of the Saints
are Incense: wherefore David says, Psalm. 141. 2.
let my Prayer be set forth before thee as Incense. Yea, and the people
assembled themselves together to pray twice a day: for thus it is said of the
people in the days of Zacharius the Priest, Luke 1. 9. 10.
according to the custom of the Priests office, his lot was to burn Incense
when he went into the Temple of the Lord, and the whole multitude of the people
were praying without, at the time of Incense. Now, whereas it was the custom
of the Priests, to offer sacrifice, and to burn incense twice a day, morning
and evening; and that the people were praying without at the time of Incense,
it is apparent, that the people came together to pray, twice a day. To such
diligent service of God, the people were tied in former times. Daniel used to
pray three times a day: which he ceased not to do, no not when the decree was
signed against him; for even then Dan. 6. 10.
he went into his house, and his windows being open in his chamber toward
Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave
thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. David also used to pray three
times a day; and he names the three set times, morning, and evening, and at
noone; so he says, Psalm. 55. 17.
Evening and morning, and at noone will I pray. In the new Testament, there is
often mention of our Savior Christ's praying: sometimes, we find him praying
early in the morning; for S. Mark says, that Mar. 1. 35.
in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed
into a solitary place, and there prayed. Sometimes, late in the evening; S.
Matthew says, Mat. 14 23.
when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to
pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. And sometimes he spent
the whole night in Prayer. For S. Luke says, that Luke 6. 12.
he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in Prayer to
God. S. Chry. de crando Deum. l. 1.
Chrysostom agreeing with these Scriptures, teaches us a necessity of praying
manietimes in the day: morning and evening, and all times in the day whenever
we receive our meat. In the morning when we are risen, before we presume to
go abroad into the Sunne-light, and before we go about our business; to praise
God for preserving us that night past; and to pray for a blessing upon our
labors and business that day; in the evening; to praise God for his blessings
all that day; to commend our selves into his hands the night following; and at
the receiving of our meat; to praise God that sends it us, and to pray for a
blessing upon it, that it may nourish us. And this, for the time of the day,
that we are to make our prayers to God.

Secondly, we are to make our prayers to God, in the 2 In regard of our present
need.
time of need. When we are in any trouble and affliction, in any grief or
heaviness, in any sorrow or sickness, in any pain of body, or grief of
mind; when we are in any peril or danger; or when we feel a want of any
temporal good thing, or any spiritual grace; in all these, and in every of
these, it is a fit time to pray unto God, and to call upon his name. David
says, Psalm. 18. 6.
In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God. Again, he
prays unto God, saying, Psalm. 22. 11.
Be not far from me, for trouble is near: for there is none to help. When
David was in great trouble, in grievous distress, and had none to help him,
no man to succor, and relieve him, then was it a needful time to pray to the
Lord for help. These are the times when, and wherein we are bound to pray unto
God.

But it is objected, that these times of Prayer, to pray Luke says, Luke 18. 1.
Christ spoke a parable unto them, to this end, that men ought always to pray,
and not to faint. And Saint Paul exhorts to 1. These. 5. 17.
pray without ceasing. To which I answer, that the words of the Evangelist, to
pray always; pray without ceasing; are not so to What it is to pray always,
and without ceasing.
be understood, as if we were bound to pray continually, without any
intermission; (for then we should do nothing else but pray, and so it would
come to pass, that in regard of continual praying, we should neglect the
duties of our calling) but to pray always, and without ceasing; is

First, to pray every day, and to let no day pass over

Secondly, to pray always, in all time of need; always,

Thirdly, to pray always, and to pray without ceasing Mat. 7. 7.
asking, seeking, and knocking at the gate of mercy, till the Lord do
graciously look upon us, hear us, and grant our requests. Thus to pray, is to
pray always; and thus a man may pray always, and not hinder the works of his
calling.

Now, seeing that there are appointed times of prayer, Against those that omit
prayer and are negligent in calling upon the name of the Lord.
intercessions, and giving of thanks; The consideration hereof, serves to
rebuke the world of great neglect in the duty of Prayer: omitting days, and
hours, and neglecting the times of calling upon the name of the Lord. It has
been declared, that holy and devout men have used to pray often in the day,
some twice a day, morning and evening; some thrice a day, morning, and evening,
and at noone: and Christ himself used to pray often in the day time, morning
and evening, and sometimes in the night too. Yea, and Heathen men have been
diligent in the morning to offer sacrifice to their Gods: Alexander, as
Historians report, Mane ante omnia sacrificabat.
first of all in the morning, offered sacrifice to the Gods: What a shame then
is it for us Christians, if we do not, morning and evening, offer spiritual
sacrifice of prayers, and praises unto the true, and living God? Prayer is our
best aids in trouble, it is the best defense against the devil our adversary:
its the best means to drive away evil spirits: in what a fearful and
dangerous case are they in then, who pass over many mornings, and many
euenings, many days, and many nights, without praying unto God, or calling
upon the name of the Lord? How fearfully, and how dangerously do they lay
them down to sleep, who do not first commend themselves into the hands of
God? Alas, wretched man, how do thou know whether thou shall live t^ll the
next morning? And if thou die that night, having not made thy prayers unto
God, nor commended thy soul to the protection, and safe-keeping of the Lord,
thou art in danger of the evil spirits, and to have thy soul taken from thee
that night. Prayer is said to be the Clauis divi, sera noctu.
key of the day, and the lock of the night. It is as a key to open the day
unto us; for as we cannot go abroad in the morning, without a key to open the
door; so neither can we, nor may we safely go abroad without prayer. And it is
the lock of the night; for as the lock in the evening shuts up the doors,
that all within the house may be in safety; so payer in the euing shuts up the
day, and keeps us safe under the protection of the Almighty: Prayer then
should be our first work, and our last work: every day should begin with
prayer, and end with prayer. And in so doing a man might every morning
willingly rise up from his bed, and every evening safely lie down to sleep,
yea, every day both cheerfully go about his business, and comfortably end
his business.

CHAP. X. Of the place of Prayer: and first of the public place of prayer.
THe Sixth thing in the Treatise of Prayer, is, of 6 The place of prayer.

place: And that is twofold:

The other, private. Twofold.

First, of the public place of prayer: The most public 1 The public place
of prayer.
place of Gods worship, and the most famous, and glorious place for the service
of God, was the Temple at Jerusalem. For there, in a more specia^l manner, God
promised his presence: as is evident by Salomons prayer, which he made unto the
Lord at the dedication of the Temple; and by the Lords answer thereunto. For
Solomon prays on this manner: 1 King. 8. 28. 29. 30.
Have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O
Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry, and to the prayer which thy servant
prays before thee to day: that thine eyes may be open toward this house,
night and day, even toward the place of which thou have said, my name shall be
there: that thou may hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make
toward this place. And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of
thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place; and hear thou in
heaven thy dwelling place, and when thou hear, forgive. And the Lord
graciously answered Solomon, and said: 1 King. 9. 3.
I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou have made before me: I
have hallowed this house which thou have built, to put my Name there for ever,
and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually. To the Jews, this
Temple that Solomon built, was the place of Gods worship: hither the people
brought their sacrifices, and burnt offerings, here the people made their
prayers twice a day. And hither came all the Deuteronomy. 16. 16.
males three times in a year to worship God. And at other times when they
prayed, they looked toward the Temple at Jerusalem, where the Lord had
promised his presence; as may be gathered from these words of Salomons prayer,
1 King. 8. 29.
Hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel,
when they shall pray toward this place: and by that which is mentioned
concerning Daniels praying unto his God, Dan. 6. 10.
His windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his
knees three times a day, and prayed. In a word, the Temple at Jerusalem, was
the place where the Lord manifested his presence, in a more glorious manner,
then in any other place in the whole earth be sides.

It may here be demanded; where is now the public Jerusalem, it is defaced,
its Luke 19. 44.
laid even with the ground: And as for the Temple, it is destroyed, and there
is not one stone left upon another: neither is the Lords presence so graciously
there now, as it was in the days of Solomon, and in the days of the Kings of
Judah, which succeeded him.

I answer, that the Temple at Jerusalem was to continue not for ever, but
only for a time; even till Christ Jerusalem ceased to be any more the certain
set place of Gods public worship: as our Savior Christ says to the woman of
Samaria, Ioh. 4. 21.
Woman, believe me, the hour comes when ye shall neither in this mountain,
nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. And again, Ver. 23.
The hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the
Father in spirit, and in truth. Again, our Savior Christ says, Math. 18. 20.
Where two, or three, are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
midst of them. Now, whereas God is still to be worshipped, and that
Christians are to worship God not only in private, but also in public; its
necessary that Christian people have decent places for the public worship of
God, which places are our material Churches. It is apparent that the Jews,
even whiles that the Temple stood, had their Luke 4. 15. 16.
Synagogues in their Cities, whither the people (which were not nigh to
Jerusalem) came to worship God, and where Acts. 15. 21.
Moses was preached, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day. So the
ancient Christians had their Eusebius. eccles. hist: l. 9. c. 10.
Oratories, that is, houses of prayer. Which were the Lords houses: And as the
Synagogues were to the Jews, and Oratories to the Christians in the first
times, such are our material Churches to us in our times. So that when
Christian people are assembled together in the name of Christ, to pray unto
God, to praise God, to hear his holy word, and to be partakers of the
Sacraments; then we may truly say of the public place, as Jacob said of
Bethel, Genesis 28. 16. 17.
Surely the Lord is in this place. And again, How dreadful is this place?
This is none other ^^t the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

The consideration of this, that there is in the time of the Gospel a public
place for the public worship of God, even the material Church, which may be
called the house of God, and the house of Prayer: serves

First, for instruction: and that

coming to the house of God; duly and diligently to resort to the public
place of Gods worship; to ^oyne with the congregation in praying, and praising
God; in hearing the word, and receiving the Sacrament. This duty the Prophet
Esaias teaches us, saying, Isa. 2. 2.
It shall come to pass^ in the last days, that the mountain of the Lords house
shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted about
the hills: and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and
say; Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the
God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
paths. The mountain of the Lord was the Temple of the Lord at Ier^salem,
which stood upon 2 Chronicles. 3. 1.
mount Moriah, whi^her the Jews came to worship God: but now the mountain of
the Lord is exalted above the hills, and all Nations flow unto it: Now, the
mountain of the Lord is, where the Gospel is preached, and in every place
where the name of the Lord is called upon. The Church of England is the
mountain of the Lord; and our particular Churches, where the Congregation is
assembled together for the worship of GOD, are holy mountains. And therefore,
all that be zealous of the Lord, al^ that love the Lords house, and all that
delight to be in the holy mountain of the Lord, should frequent the house of
God, and be willing and ready to come up to the public place of Gods
worship; and not only be forward themselves to come to the house of the Lord,
but to call upon their Children and Servants, and to say to their friends and
neighbors, Come ye, and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, to the
house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his w^yes, and we will walk
in his paths. And all Christian people are bound to frequent, and diligently
to come unto the Reasons to mo^ue us to frequent the house of God.
house of God, the public place of Gods worship, there to make supplications,
prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks; there to hear the word of God,
and ^o be partakers of the Sacraments, and that for these reasons.

First, the Scripture exhorts unto it: the Psalmist 1 Scripture.
says, Psalm 14^. 1.
Sing unto the Lord a new song: and his prais^ in the congregation of Saints.
Again, Psalm. 150. 1.
Praise God in his Sanctuary. And again he says, Psalm. 95. 2.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving. Verse 6.
O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our maker.
Thus the Scripture exhorts to come to the house of God, and to worship God in
the public place of Gods worship

Secondly, it was the custom of the people both in 2 Custom of the Church of
God.
Christ's time, and after, to come to their Synagogues every Sabbath day to
worship God, and to hear the word of God read and preached unto them: for S.
Luke says, that Jesus Luke 4. 16.
came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and as his custom was, he
went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read. And in
the Acts of the Apostles, he says, Acts 15. 21.
Moses of the old time has in every City them that preach him, being read
in the Synagogues every Sabbath day.

Thirdly, good men have had great love to the house of 3 Good men have had
great love to the house of God.
God, to the public place of Gods worship, insomuch that when they might have
free access to the house of God, they have rejoiced, and been exceeding glad;
as David, saying, Psalm. 122. 1.
I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord.
Contrariwise, when they could not come to the house of God, to the public
place of Gods worship, to join with the congregation in praying, and praising
God, they have been exceeding sad, and sorrowful, heavy hearted, and their
souls have been even cast down within them. Such was David's zeal to the
house of the Lord: saying, Psalm. 42. 1. 2. 3 4. 5.
As the Heart pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after thee, O
God, my soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and
appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night; while they
continually say unto me, where is thy God? when I remember these things, I
power out my soul in me; for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them
to the house of God; with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that
kept holy day. Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why art thou disquieted
in me? hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him for the help of his
countenance. And again he says, Psalm. 84. 1. 2.
How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! my soul longs, yea, even
faints for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh cries out for the
living God.

Fourthly, It is meet and right, that upon the Lords 4 It is meet and
requisite on the Lords day, to be in the Lords house.
day, we be found in the Lords house: for what house can a man be in better
then in Gods house? What better company can a man desire to have, then the
company of the godly? or what better fellowship then the fellowship of the
faithful? what talk, what communication, what conference can be better, then
to speak unto God by prayer, and to hear God speak unto us out of his holy
word? or what better mirth, then in Gods house to sing Psalms to the praise of
God? Now, the consideration of these things should make us every one more

Secondly, seeing that there are places consecrated and 2 To come into Gods

set apart for the public worship of God; this may teach us to come into the
house God with all reverence, and humility, when we come for these holy ends,
to pray to God, to praise God, to hear his holy word, and to be partakers of
the Sacraments: for in the performance of these sacred duties the Lord is
present, and the holy Angels are present; and God is holy, his Angels are holy,
and his word is holy: for this cause, Moses coming into the presence of the
Lord, is commanded to put his shoes off his feet; Exodus 3. 5.
Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou stand is
holy ground. And Solomon gives us this direction about the manner of our
coming into the house of God, Eccles. 5. 1.
Ke^pe thy foot when thou go to the house of God. Wherefore, when we are
going into the house of God, it is good to say with David, Psalm. 5. 7.
In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.

Secondly, this serves for reprehension, and it reprooues,

house of God: many have little care to frequent Gods house: and make no
conscience of sanctifying the Sabbath, and keeping holy the Lords day. Who
dedicate that day not to God, but to Bacchus and Venus: making it a day of
reuelling, and banqueting, a day of wantonness and wickedness: who, instead
of saying one to another, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to
the house of the God of Jacob; say, Come, let us go to the Alehouse, let us
sit there, let us eat and drink, and rise up to play. Is not this plainly to
despise Gods house, and to set light by the place of Gods worship? Others are
so overcome with worldliness, that they are loath to spare so much time as to
consecrate one day of seven to the service of God. Hence it is that some
cannot keep their hands from doing some servile work upon the Sabbath day;
and that others (lest they should miss their market, or not come to their
iournies end at the set time) labor, and travail, and ride on their journey
upon the Lords day: and that when there is no absolute necessity; but that
their journey and business might be otherwise conveniently disposed of, if
worldliness had not taken too great a rooting in their hearts. Such people had
therefore need to repent of their neglect in coming to the public place of
Gods worship; and to be careful that they henceforward Isay 5^. 13.
turn away their foot from doing their own pleasure, and doing their own
ways on the Lords holyday.

Secondly, seeing that our material Churches are the 2 Against those which

places of Gods worship; this reprooues those who profane the house of God by
any manner of disorder. For this cause our Savior Christ was displeased, to
see the Temple of the Lord profaned by those that sold Oxen, and Sheep, and
Doves, and changers of money; insomuch that he made a John 2. 15.
scourge of small cords, and drove them all out of the Temple. And S. Mark
says, that he Mark 11. 16.
would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel thorough the Temple.
And yet this Temple was not the Sanctuary, but only the Court of the Temple,
which Christ would not have to be profaned.

Thirdly, here they are reproved, who are backward 3 Against those who will
not willingly contribute to the maintenance and reparation of the Church.
and unwilling to contribute to the necessary maintenance and reparation of
the material Church; David, that holy man of God, did purpose (such was his
zeal) to build a house for the Lord; for he reasoned thus: Sam. 7. 2.
I dwell in a house of Cedar, but the Ark of God dwells within curtains.
This saying of David is verified with many, in many places of our Land, though
they cast not so far as David did, neither have hearts so zealously affected
as David had; for many men build fair and goodly houses for themselves, but
build, whatdoe I say build? repair not the houses of God, which are built to
their hands: and many men are careful enough to beautify and adorn their own
houses, with great cost; but care not in what case the house of God be. They
dwell in their Hagg. 1. 4.
sieled houses, and suffer the house of God to lie wast. Let such men search
their own hearts, and they shall find, that they come far^e short of David's
zeal to the house of God.

CHAP. XI. Of the private place of prayer: where, of domestical, or Household
prayer; and also of Secret prayer in the Chamber, or in any secret place.
AS public prayer has ordinarily a certain set 2 The private place of

place, the house of God; so has also private prayer, and the place for
private prayer is twofold.

The one, domestical; in the house with the family In the house.


First, of domestical, or household prayer:

In handling, whereof, I will Therein Two things.


First show, to whom this duty chiefly belongs. Secondly use reasons to
persuade thereunto.
For the First: The performance of household prayer 1 To whom the performance
thereof chiefly belongs. namely, to the Master of the house.
together with the family, is a duty chiefly, and principally, belonging to
householders, to Parents, and masters of families. As upon the Lords day,
Parents and masters of families, are bound not only to come to the house of God
themselves, but likewise to bring with them, their children and servants to the
public worship of God: so likewise in the house; Parents and Masters of
families are bound, morning and evening, and at all times of the day when they
receive their meat; to pray to God, and to praise God, either themselves, if
they have knowledge, and ability to perform the same: or else, to see it
performed by some other; and that through their default, prayer and
thanksgiving be not omitted:

And that for these reasons: And that.


First, This is our daily service, and spiritual sacrifice; 1 In regard of
order and to avoid confusion in the family
morning and evening to call upon the name of the Lord, to pray unto him, and
to praise him: in the morning, before we begin our work, at our meals, when
we receive our meat; and at night, when we have ended our business, before we
say us down to sleep: now, there ought to be an order for the observing of
this service and worship of God; and to whom in all the family should this care
and duty belong, to see this service performed, but to him who is the head of
the house? so then the care of the performance of this duty, lies principally
upon the master of the house, in regard of order, and to avoid confusion in
the family.

Secondly, this duty of worshipping God, and doing 2 Parents and masters of
houses are so charged and commanded.
him service privately in the house, is a duty wherewith Parents and masters
of families are charged: Moses, the the man of God, exhorting the Children of
Israel to obedience, directs his speech to the heads of the houses, the
masters of families, saying,

These words which I command thee this day, shall be in a Deuteronomy. 6. 6. 7.
thine heart, and thou shall teach them diligently unto thy children, and shall
talk of them when thou sit in thine house, and when thou walk by the
way, and when thou lie down and when thou risest up. So the observation of
the Sabbath lies chiefly upon all heads of houses, and masters of families;
they must not only sanctify the Sabbath themselves, but likewise, see that
their children and servants do sanctify it, for its said, Remember the
Sabbath day, to keep it holy, etc. In it thou shall not do any work, thou,
nor thy son nor thy daughter, thy man-seruant, nor thy maid-seruant, etc.
Now, the Sabbath is sanctified, not only by reading the Scriptures, hearing
the word, meditation etc. But likewise, by praying, and praising God: and that,
not only publicly in the Church, but also privately at home, where, Parents,
and Masters of families have the chief command. Wherefore, I conclude, that
the care of performing the duty of praying, b Exodus 20. 8. 9. 10.
and praising God in the family, belongs to the master of the family. 2
Reasons to persuade to House-


Now the reasons which may persuade all parents, and house-holders, to the
practice of this duty, are these:

First, Examples of holy, and good men: Abraham receives 1 Good men have used
it.
this commendation from the Lord; Genesis 18. 19.
I know him, that he will command his children, and his household after him,
and they shall keep the way of the Lord. Abraham had care to instruct his
children, and servants, in the ways of the Lord, and to teach his household how
to worship God: When Abraham pitched his tent on the mountain on the Genesis 12.
8.
East of Bethel, there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the
Name of the Lord. That is, as Muscul, in Genesis 12.
some expound it, he called together his house hold, and there instructed them
concerning the true worship of the true, and only God; he prayed with them,
and offered sacrifice to the Lord. Joshua has this worthy saying to the
children of Israel, Josh. 24. 15.
choose you this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers
served, that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites;
in whose land ye dwell: But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.
Now, this is one principal part in the worship and service of God, to pray to
the Lord, and to call upon his name. For this cause, those households and
families which have made conscience of worshipping God in their houses, have
been called Churches: as the household of Priscilla and Aquila, is called by
the name of a Church, Romans 16. 3.
Greet Priscilla and Aquila; Ver. 5.
likewise greet the Church that is in their house.

The second reason, I take from the necessity of performing

Prayer in our houses, is necessary to be used; for Household prayer is
necessary: For


First, without Prayer, we can expect no blessing, nor be assured of any good
success upon our labors, and business which we take in hand: wherefore it is
said in 1 Without praying to God, we can look for no blessing upon our labors
the Psalms, Psalm. 127. 1. 2.
Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except
the Lord keep the City, the watchman waketh but in vain. It is vain for
you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he
gives his beloved sleep. The meaning, is, that the affairs, the labors, and
business which men take in hand, do not prosper, except the Lord give a
blessing to their labors: and the means to procure a blessing, is by prayer.
In the morning, before we begin our work, to pray to the Lord for a blessing;
and in the evening before we lie down, to praise God for his blessings. S.
James tells us, that Iam. 1. 17.
every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from
the Father of lights: and again he says, Jam. 4. 2.
ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye
fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. Giving us to understand,
that if we would have any blessing from God, we must ask it at Gods hands, we
must pray to God, and call upon the name of the Lord.

Secondly, Families that call not upon the name of the 2 Families that call not
upon the name of the Lord, are heathenish: and subject to Gods wrath.
Lord, are noted to be heathenish; and the wrath of God hangs over them; which
the Prophet Jeremy shows, saying, Iere. 10. 25.
power out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families
that call not upon thy name. He says two things: first, they that do not call
upon the name of the Lord, are like to heathen men which know not God:
secondly, he lets all such as do not call upon the name of the Lord, know, and
understand, that they are in a very fearful and dangerous case; for the
fury and wrath of God hangs over those countries, cities, and towns, over
those houses, and families that call not upon the name of the Lord.

Now, whereas household prayer ought to be used, and is so necessary, as has
been showed; the consideration Against those who neglect household prayer.
this duty. Genesis 12. 8.
Abraham, in the place where he pitched his tent, there he builded an altar
unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord. All men are for the most
part, careful enough to provide them houses; but when they have built them
houses, they are not careful with Abraham, to build an altar: they do not set
up the worship of God in their houses. This is held by some, to be too much
ado; and they that use prayer in their houses, are thought by some, to be too
precise: and many are afraid, if they should use Prayer in their houses, lest
they should be accounted so too: this hinders many from the practice of this
religious duty. But consider o man, in what a dangerous case thou art, if thou
do negligently omit, or wilfully contemn this godly, and religious duty;
for, thou can look for no favor from God, nor expect any blessing upon the
labors, and business, which either thou, or any of thy household goes about,
except that supplications, and prayers be made unto God. And what? fear thou
nothing the wrath and vengeance of God, which hangs over thee, and thy house,
as long as thou call not upon the name of the Lord? O consider these things,
and repent of this neglect. Wherefore, if any one has altogether omitted this
duty, let him now at the length with Abraham, build an altar to the Lord, let
him set up the worship of God in his house, and call upon the name of the Lord.
If any one has been negligent in performance of this duty, let him repent of
that neglect, and be more diligent in the practice of the same; and whosoever
does use it, let him be encouraged to be constant in the same. Knowing this,
that no man shall serve the Lord in vain; but as the Prophet Malachie says,
the day shall come, when ye shall Mal. 3. 18.
discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God,
and him that serves him not. And this, of domestical, or household Prayer.

The second place for private Prayer, is the secret place: 2 The secret place,
for ^ecret Prayer.
for as there is a public place, for all the Congregation to pray together,
which is the Church; and as there is a place for the household, and family to
pray together, which is every man's own house; so there is a more private, and
secret place, for a man to pray alone; which is his chamber, or closet, or any
other secret place. Of this place our Savior Christ speaks, enioyning us to
pray in secret: Mat. 6. 6.
When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou have shut thy door,
pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which sees in secret,
shall reward thee openly. Now, this place of Prayer, is said to be secret,

First, because a Christian may be in his chamber, closet,

Secondly, because there, a sinner may without fear, secret, and will reward
him openly.

This serves to reprove,

First, those, who neglect this duty of praying in secret; 1 Against those who
pray not in secret.
Some think that praying in the Church is sufficient, and that they need not,
at least, so much, and so often, to be praying in the house, or chamber.
Others, are so highly conceited of household Prayer, that they esteem less
of public Prayer, and often omit prayer in secret: but we ought to know, and
understand, that there is a necessity in this, as well as in the other.

Secondly, here they are reproved, who sin in secret, 2 Against those who
sin in secret, but do not pray in secret.
but do not humble themselves in secret before the Lord, confessing their
sins, and craving pardon at Gods hands. Tell me thou that sinnest in secret,
and have so little devotion to pray to God in secret; what hope can thou
have, that God will reward thee with any blessing? nay rather, for thy secret
sins, expect an open punishment: yea, woe unto thee, except thou repent of
thy secret sins, and pray unto God, that God in mercy may cover them, and not
lay them open, to thy perpetual shame.

CHAP. XII. Of the place of Prayer more general, and unlimited.
HItherto of the place of Prayer, as it is ordinarily used to be in some
certain set place, as in the Church, house, chamber, closet, or any secret
place.

Secondly, the place of Prayer more generally, is in any 2 The place of Prayer
more generally, in any place.
place, every where, and in every place, as necessity requires, and as
occasion is offered. Our Savior says, Mat. 18. 20.
Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
of them. St Paul says, 1. Tim 2. 8.
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without
wrath and doubting. So that now in the time of the Gospel, we are not limited
to any certain set place, but a Christian may pray every where, or (...).
in every place. And this praying every where, or in every place, is to be
considered two ways: Considered two ways.


First, when any one, upon a just occasion, does upon 1 In regard of the
present occasion in any place.
the sudden, lift up his heart, and pray unto God, for some temporal
blessing, or some spiritual grace; or feeling some present temptation, makes a
present supplication against it: or being in any present danger, prays for
deliverance; or when he meditateth of the goodness of the Lord toward him, he
presently blesses God in his heart. These are prayers, which, for the shortness
and suddenness of them are called eiaculations, spiritual darts of the heart,
arising from the motion of the good Spirit. These prayers a man may make, yea,
and the godly man does make, at all ti^es when occasion is offered, and in all
places wheresoever he is: whether he be in the Church, or in the chamber,
whether in the house, or in the field: whether he be sitting, or walking;
whother going, or riding; whether lying down, or rising up.

Secondly, a man may pray every where, or in every place, 2 In regard of the
present necessi^e, ^indering him from the public place of Prayer.
when as by some urgent occasion, or extraordinary employment, or for want of
liberty, or by reason of sickness, or infirmity, he cannot come to the house
of God, to join with the Congregation; nor yet be present with his Family in
his own house; in such cases, wheresoever a man prays, the place hinders
not his prayers from ascending up to the throne of God. For Gods ears are open
to the righteous that call upon him, in all places alike: and God hears the
Prayers of the righteous as well in one place, as in another. Hezekiah lying
sick on his bed, prayed unto the Lord, for its said, that Isa. 3^. 1. 2.
he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, Jeremy praye^h in
the dungeon, Lam. 3. 55.
I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon. Daniel prays in his
Dan. 6. 10.
Chamber. Jonah prays to the Lord his God, Ion. 2. 1.
out of the fishes belly. Cornelius prayed Act. 10. 30.
in his house. Paul and Silas being in Act. 16. ^4 25
prison, prayed, and s^^g praises unto God. Paul (...). 2^. ^.
kneeled down on the (Sea) shore, and prayed. Now, these were all holy, and
devout men, and had their Prayers heard: God regarded and heard the P^ayer^
which they made, some on their beds, some in the prison, some in the dungeon,
some in their houses, some in their chambers, and some on the Sea shore. So
then, although ordinarily, the Church be the place for public prayer; a man's
house, for household prayer; and the chamber, or closet, for more private, or
secret Prayer; yet in case of necessity, no^ only the Church, or house, or
chamber; but any place may be the place of Prayer: in what place soever a man
be, he may pray, lifting up as the Apostle says, holy (and pure) hands, to
which, agrees the saying of St Ambrose; Non locus orationem c^^menda^, sed
(...). Amb. in Romans 1.
It is not the place that commends a man's Prayer, but the d^uout mind of him
that prays.

The consid^ration of this, that God hears in every every Consolation to

where; do^^ (...) consolation and great comfort unto those, (...) regard of
some present necessity, or infirmity, (...) to the house of God, to join
with the Congregation in the public place of Gods worship: as captiu^^ and
prisoners, soldiers, sailers, and passengers; as sic^^ pe^^ons, lying sick on
their beds, or being diseased with ^nfi^mitie and pain: the case of all these,
is such, that they cannon come to the public place of Gods worship, to the
house of Prayer. What then? are they therefore bar^^d from Prayer? and are they
therefore deprived of the benefit of calling upon the name of the Lord? or if
they pray, will not God hear their prayers, because they come not to the
Church to pray? nay, not so: but if the Prisoner that lies in prison fast
bound with chains, can with Paul and Silas, pray, and praise God God can and
will hear his Prayer, even in the prison, and in the dungeon: so Merchants,
sailers, passengers on the seas, and soldiers in the field, though they be
far from any Church, if they can devoutly, and heartily call upon the name of
the Lord, whether it be on the sea, or on the land, the Lord can hear them
all, as well as he heard the Prayer of Paul on the Seashore; and of Jonah in
the Whales belly, in the depth of the sea. And for those that lie sick on
their beds, or are diseased with any infirmity, and pain of body, so that
they cannot come to the Church, but necessarily remain at home; herein is
their comfort, the Lord can hear, and does hear in secret, in the house, and
chamber, as well as in the Church; as the Lord sees in all places, so does he
also hear at all times, and in all places: and if they lift up as the Apostle
says, holy and pure hands, without wrath and doubting, no doubt but the Lord
hears their prayers, though (through necessity) they pray at home. The place
hinders not: every place is pure, if the heart be pure: it is the mind, the
heart, and the affection of him that prays, which God regards, more then
the place where he prays. And this, concerning the place of Prayer.

CHAP. XIII. Of the manner how we are to pray aright: and First, of preparation
before we pray, and of Attention in praying.
THE Seventh thing in the treatise of Prayer, is concerning the manner how we
may pray aright, 7 The manner how we may pray aright. Nine things required
thereunto.
that our prayers may be acceptable and well pleasing unto almighty God. And in
the framing of our prayers aright, their are nine things required; all, of
absolute necessity to the making of a good, and acceptable prayer:

The first whereof, is Preparation: 1 Preparation. Standing in two things.


And the preparing of our selves aright for prayer stands specially in these
two things.

First, in withdrawing the mind from the buisie cares 1 A with drawing the
mind from the world.
of the world:

Secondly, in setting the heart upon God, thinking with our selves, and
seriously meditating, both of the Lord God to whom we pray, as also for what we
pray: 2 A drawing the heart up unto God.
considering with our selves, in whose presence we are to appear, when we fall
down to prayer: praying to the Lord, to direct us by his holy spirit, that we
may pray aright, and ask such things as are agreeable to his will: Now, when
the mind is not bu^ie about the cares of the world; and the thoughts of the
heart are thus drawn up unto God, then is the soul more fit, and better
prepared to pray unto God. To this preparation, Solomon exhorts us, saying,
Eccles. 5.
Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any
thing before God; to which agrees the saying of the son of Syrach, Ecclus
18. 23.
Before thou praiest, prepare thy self, and be not as one that tempts the
Lord. Where, the wise man shows two things, the one, is the duty required,
namely, to prepare our selves for prayer, before we pray; the other, is the
necessity of this preparation, for if we do not prepare our selves, before we
pray, we are to be reckoned in the number of those that tempt God.

This serves to reprove, all rash, sudden, and hasty manner of praying;
when men come to pray, and do Against hasty and rash praying.
not prepare themselves before hand: but come to the performance of that duty,
rashly, without meditation, and due preparation. Consider with me: if a man
have a petition to prefer to the Kings Majesty, and has that favor granted
him, that he may have access into the Kings presence; or if his suite be but
to some great Lord, and honorable person; what preparation will that man make
before hand? how careful will he be to look to his apparel, that it be
handsome? to see to his hands, and face, that they be clean? and how careful
will he be of his gesture and behavior? thinking with himself, how shall I
behave my self, when I come into the presence of so great a man? and how
circumspect will he be of his words, to place his words aright, that so he may
receive a good answer? And if a man be thus careful, and circumspect, to
prepare himself when he shall come into the presence of an earthly King, or
before some great Lord; o how careful, and how circumspect ought every one to
be, when we come to appear before the Lord, the great God, and King of ^^ ^he
earth? when we come to tread in the courts of the (...) house, and to call upon
his holy name, either publicly, or privately, how careful ought we to be, to
look to the inward garment of our conscience, that it be white and clean? to
wash our hands in innocence, before we come to the altar of the Lord? to look
to our gesture and behavior that it be with all reverence? and to be watchful
over our words, that we be not rash with our mouth, nor hasty to utter any
thing before God? and this, of preparation before we pray.

The Second thing required in the framing of our 2 Attention in praying.
prayers aright, is Attention in praying. Before we pray, we must make
preparation for prayer: and in praying, we must be careful to pray with
attention, to pray with the heart and affection, lest we be in the number of
those, who Isa. 29. 13. Standing in three things.
draw near to God with their mouth, and with their lips do honor him, but
have removed their heart far from him: And this attention in praying stands
specially in three things. 1 Attending the matter of prayer.


First, in praying, we must carefully attend to the words which we utter;
lest, we err in the matter of prayer, and so may pray amiss.

Secondly, in praying, we must have regard to the 2 Having respect to the
sense; understanding what we pray.
sense and meaning of the words which we utter, understanding what we pray:
that we may pray as the Apostle says. 1 Cor. 14. 15.
With the Spirit, and pray with the understanding also.

Thirdly, in praying our mind must be above, and 3 The heart must be fixed upon
God.
our heart so fixed upon God, that it do not wander from God, through
by-thoughts. These three things are requisite for our attention in praying.

The consideration of this attention in praying, reprooues Against those who in
praying give liberty to their wandering thoughts.
or privately, have many wandering thoughts and worldly cogitations. So that,
although they bow their knees, yet their hearts are little moved; though their
bodies be in the Church, their minds are abroad; and though their mouths utter
words, and their lips move apace, yet their hearts are on the world, and the
things on the world; either on the profits, or pleasures of the world.

Here some may say, it is true, I confess; in praying, whether in public or
private, I have sundry distractions, and hinder my devotion; how should I be
rid of them or what remedy is to be used against them?

I answer; the best remedy is, earnestly to strive against Genesis 15. 11.
Abraham drove away the Fowls, which would have devoured his sacrifice. For,
to give a willing consent unto wandering thoughts, and worldly cogitations,
which arise in the mind at the time of prayer, and to please our selves
therewith, is sinful: it shows small devotion, and argues little or no
preparatio before hand: but to have a sense and feeling of our wandering
thoughts, and withal to dislike the^, to strive against them, and to labor to
drive them away; is a sign of grace, and argues a heart deuoutely affected.

CHAP. XIIII. Of Humility in praying: and of avoiding vain repetitions.
THe third thing required in praying, is Humility: 3 Humility in praying.
Twofold.
And humiltie in praying is two fold.

The one, is outward.
The other, Inward.
First, of outward Humility: Outward humility in 1 Outward humility. Showed
by out ward gestures as.
praying is showed by our outward gesture; Now the Scripture mentions diverse
sorts of gestures, which have been used in praying; but the Scripture does not
bind us by precept to the strict observance of any certain gesture in
praying; only it lets us see by examples, what has been the custom of the
Church of God, concerning gesture in praying. 1 Standing.


First, Standing has been a gesture used in prayer. Luk 18. 11.
The Pharisee stood and prayed: And of the Publican its said, that he was Verse.
13.
standing a far off. And I find it decreed in a general Council, that
according to the custom of the Churches, the people P^ siantes ad orationem,
v^ta Domino reddamus. Council. Nicen. 1. Can. 20.
should pray standing.

Secondly, Kneeling is a gesture commended unto us, by the practice of godly
and devout men; Salomen in his prayer at the dedication of the Temple, kneeled
2 Kneeling.
down and prayed, for it is said, 1 Kin. 8. 54.
When Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer, and supplication unto
the Lord, he arose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling on his
knees. David says, Psalm. 95. 6.
O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our maker.
So Daniel Dan. 6. 10.
kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed. And Paul, when he was
ready to take ship, Acts. 21. 5.
kneeled down on the shore, and prayed. And Christ himself Luke 32. 41.
kneeled down, and prayed.

Thirdly, Lifting up of the hands is gesture used in 3 Lifting up of the hands.
prayer; David used it, for he says, Psalm. 28. ^.
Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee; when I lift up my
hands toward thy holy Oracle. And St. Paul says, 1 Timothy 2. 8.
I will that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands.

Fourthly, Looking up to heaven is a gesture used in 4 Looking up to Heaven.
prayer: this gesture our Savior Christ used, when he sed the five thousand
with five loaves and two fishes; Math 14. 19.
Looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the looues to his
Disciples, and the Disciples to the multitude. Besides these, to pray ^ Cor.
^1. 4.
bareheaded; to Luk 18. 13.
smite upon the breast; testifying thereby the sorrow and grief of the heart,
and such like, are outward gestures used in prayer.

But notwithstanding this diversity of gesture in praying, and that a Christian
has more liberty for his gesture in private; yet, both in public and
private, we are to use such outward gesture as may manifest the inward
humility of the heart; and in public, we are to conform our selves to the
same gesture which is used in the Church where we live; lest, using a gesture
different from that which is received, and used in the Church, we give
occasion of offense; and the rather, because the Apostle speaking of the well
ordering of the Church, says, 1 Cor. 14. 40.
Let all things be done decently, and in order. Now, for a man in time of
public prayer, to use a gesture different from the rest of the Congregation,
as to sit, when the rest kneel; to be covered when the rest are ba^^headed,
etc. is no decency, nor order; but vnseemlinesse, and disorder.

The consideration of this diversity of gesture in praiing, Consolation to
sick persons, and lame people.
this, or that certain gesture, at all times; does yield consolation to all
sick persons, and lame people; to all that are so holden with infirmity in
their limbs, or are so weak in body, that they cannot bow their body, nor
bend their knees, according to the usual custom of the Church; for God does
not so much regard the outward gesture of bowing the body, and bending the knee,
as the bowing and bending of the heart: and therefore if the heart be right in
the sight of God, and if the mind be attentive in praying, God will not
despise the prayer of him that prays, though he do not kneel; If through
sickness, or infirmity, he cannot bend the knee of his body, it is sufficient
before God, if he bend the knee of his heart. And therefore we find David
praying, and that earnestly, with tears, not kneeling upon his knees, but
lying upon the Psalm. 6. 6.
bed of his sickness* so likewise Hezekiah being 2 Kin. 20. 1. 2.
sick unto death, turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord. And
it is recorded of Jacob, that when he blessed the two sons of Joseph,
Ephraim, and Manasses, that is, when he prayed to God to bless them, and
foretold their future state, he Genesis 48. 2. 15.
sat upon the bed. Necessity then dispenses with the outward gesture in
prayer. And this, of outward humility in praying.

The other kind of Humility in praying, is Inward: 2 Inward humility.
which inward humility is the humbleness of the heart, the lowly bowing of the
heart, and the bending of the knees of the heart. Of this humility it is that
the Lord speaks to Solomon, saying, 2 Chronicles. 7. 14.
If my people which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray,
and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from
heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their Land. If the people
in their distress would have the Lord to be gracious and merciful unto them,
and deliver them, they must pray, but they must pray with humility and
humblenes of mind, they must bring down the stubbornness of their heart, and
humble their souls, they must humble themselves, and pray. And this is done by
an humble acknowledgement of our own unrighteousness, wickedness, and
unworthiness. As Jacob does, saying, Genesis 32. 10.
I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of all the truth, which
thou have showed unto thy servant. So Daniel confesses, saying, Dan. 9. 7 8.
O Lord, righteousness belongs unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, etc.
And again, he says, O Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our Kings,
to our Princes, and to our Fathers; because we have sinned against thee. This
was the humility of the Centurion, who said unto Christ, Mat. 8. 8.
Lord, I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof. And of the
prodigal son, humbling himself before his Father, and saying, Luk 15. 21.
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy
to be called thy son. And this humility in prayer is acceptable with God, and
is of great force to move the Lord to be merciful unto us, to incline his
ears to our prayers, to hear us, and help us in the time of our need: as
the Lord promises Solomon, saying. 2 Chronicles. 7. 14.
If my people will humble themselves and pray, etc. then will I hear from
heaven; and will forgive their sin, and will heal their Land. And the wise
Son of Sirach says, Ecclus. 35. 17.
The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds.

The consideration of this inward humility required Against those who give unto
God only outward worship.
who, in their worshipping of God, give unto the Lord but only outward
worship; they are content, according to usual custom, to bare the head, to
bow the body, and bend the knee, as others do; but for humbling of the soul,
bowing of the heart, contrition of spirit, and drawing up of the thoughts unto
God, these, with many, are not, or but slightly performed.

But, what shall it profit thee, O man, or what reward shall thou have, if thou
vncouerest thy head, and couerest thy sins? if thou bowest thy body, and
do not humble thy soul? if thou bendest thy knee, and have within thee a
hard and stubborn heart? or what great thing do thou, if thou only
bring thy body near unto God, and honor him with thy lips, and tongue,
when as thy heart is far from God? The outward humbling of the body alone
may content men, but cannot please God: the inward humility of the heart is
most acceptable to God: but both joined together* are best pleasing both to God
and man: and this, of humility in praying.

The 4 thing required in the framing of our prayers, is, 4 The avoiding of
vain repetitions in praying. Twofold.
that we be careful to avoid vain repetitions. And this fault of using vain
repetitions stands in two things;

First, in a vain and idle repeating of the same things; making the same
petitions again and again, this is properly called Battologie, or vain
repetition. 1 Battologie.


Secondly, in multitude of words, regarding more the multitude of words and
length of time, in praying, then either the matter of prayer, or the sense 2
Polylogie.
of the words uttered in praying: this is properly called Polylogie, or much
talking. Both which are reproved by our Savior Christ, saying, Math. 6 7.
When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, a^ the heathen do. For they think
that they shall Vain repetition to be avoided. For.
be heard in their much speaking. Now, in praying we must avoid vain
repetitions, and much speaking.

First, because that therein there is much labor of the lips, but little
moving of the heart, which is a thing displeasing 1 It is but lip labor.
unto God.

Secondly, because this is the manner of the heathen which know not God:
wherefore, says our Savior, 2 It is heathenish.
when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do.

Thirdly, God does not hear men the sooner because of their much speaking, and
many words, for the heathen 3 God does not therefore the sooner hear them.
think (says our Savior) that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
They think so, but it is not so.

Fourthly, it is not needful to use vain repetitions in praying to the Lord,
nor to weary him with much talking, 4 It is not needful.
for the Lord knows what things we stand in need of before we pray, as our
Savior also says, Math. 6. 8.
Be not therefore like unto them, that is, the heathen, for your Father knows
what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

The consideration of the unlawfulness of using vain repetitions, and much
speaking in prayer, serves to reprove,

First, those who tie themselves to a set number of prayers, 1 Against those
who tie themselves, to an often repeating of the same prayers.
and to a strict observation of repeating often over their prayers, as the
Lords prayer; yea, those which are no prayers, as the Aue, and the Creed; the
one being but a Salutation, and the other a confession of our Faith.

Secondly, here they are reproved, who in their conceived 2 Against those who
in their conceived prayers, use often repetitions.
prayers, either through want of knowledge, or affecting length of time; use
many words, and often repetitions of the same things, and for the most part,
disorderly placed.

Here it may be demanded, whether the using of long much speaking?

I answer; if any one use many words to prolong the time, pleasing himself in
the multitude of words, and Lo^ga non est, in qu^ nihil red^ndat.
superfluous, nor idle; but that is a long prayer, which abounds with
superfluity of speech; having little matter, but many words, and many
repetitions of the same things: that is a long, and a tedious Prayer.

CHAP. XV. Of Feruencie, and Perseverance in Prayer.
THE fifth thing necessarily required in praying, 5 Feruencie in Prayer.
is Feruencie in Prayer. Of which Saint James says, Iam. 5 16.
the effectual fervent Prayer of a righteous man avails much. Prayer
avails much; but what prayer is it that avails much? It is the fervent and
earnest Prayer. We have sundry examples in the Scriptures, of this feruencie
in praying. David prays thus, Psalm. 17. 1.
Hear the right, o Lord, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my Prayer, that
goes not out of fained lips. Again, he prays, saying, Psalm. 130. 2.
Lord hear my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my
supplications. And again, Psalm. 39. 12.
hear my Prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry, hold not thy peace at my
tears. So Daniel prays in feruencie of spirit, Dan. 9. 19.
O Lord hear, O Lord forgive, O Lord hearken and do: Where, the doubling, and
trebling of their requests, argues the feruencie of their Prayers. The two
blindmen mentioned by S. Matthew, hearing that Jesus passed by, cried out,
saying, Mat. 20. 30. 31
Have mercy on us, O Lord thou son of David. And when the multitude rebuked
them, its said, They cried the more, saying, have mercy on us, O Lord, thou
son of David. Thus earnestly did the woman of Canaan pray for her daughter.
She coming unto Christ, Mat. 15. 22.
cried unto him, saying, have mercy on me, O Lord thou son of David, my
daughter is grievously vexed with a Devil. But he answered her not a word.
Then his Disciples pitying her, spoke unto him in her behalf, beseeching him
to help her; and he gives a cold answer, saying, Ver. 24.
I am not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Notwithstanding this, she comes again, and cries unto him, saying, Ver. 25.
29. 27.
Lord, help me, but he answered, and said, It is not meet to take the
childrens bread, and to cast it to dogs. And she replied, saying, truth Lord:
yet the dogs eat of the crummes which fall from their masters table. By which
it is evident, that his woman was very fervent in making her petition, and
very earnest with the Lord for the obtaining of her request. And although at
the first, the Lord did not grant her request, yet at the last he did: though
Christ did at the first refuse to give her of the childrens bread, yet at the
length Tam^n dedit, quia illa etiam vehementer exegit. Chrysostom. in Math. Hom. 23.
he did give her, because as a Father says, she did so earnestly crave it.
Elias also is an example unto us of praying fervently; St James says, Jam. 5.
17. 18.
Elias was a man subject to the lik^ passions as we are, and he prayed
earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space
of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave
rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. Elias prayed, and the Lord heard
his Prayer. But how did Elias pray? he prayed earnestly. He (...).
prayed and prayed: he prayed with great feruencie. Thus it is manifest by the
Scriptures, that feruencie is required in praying. And here it is to be
considered, that this feruencie in praying, is showed, and appears diverse
ways: Sometimes, by the lifting up of the hands: as David does, saying, Psalm.
28. 2.
hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee. When I lift up my
hands toward thy h^ly Oracle. Sometimes, by lifting up of the eyes, and looking
up to heaven. Which also David used, Psalm. 5. 3.
In the morning says he, will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
Sometimes, with smiting on the breast, as did the Publicane: who, Luke 18. 13.
smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. Sometimes,
this feruencie of prayer, is expressed by crying a loud, as we may find David
in sundry Psalms, praying, and crying to the Lord in his Prayer* Psalm. 18. 6.
In my distress says he, I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God. So
the Ninevites in their distress fasted, and prayed, and in their prayers, Ion.
3. 8.
cried mightily unto God. Sometimes, this feruencie is showed by tears, and
weeping: so Christ Jesus our Savior in his Agony prayed with tears, as
witnesses the Apostle, Heb. 5. 7.
who in the days of his flesh, says he, when he had offered up prayers and
supplications, with strong crying, and tears: And sometimes, a fervent prayer
may be made with fewer outward signs, and with less noise; even with inward
groans and sighs, without voice, and words heard: when the heart, being
deuout^y affected, sends forth requests unto the throne of grace: such was
the Prayer that Moses made, when the Lord said unto him, Exodus 14, 15.
wherefore criest thou unto me? We find not that Moses uttered any words when
he prayed; only his heart prayed, and that earnestly; and the loud cry of his
hearty Prayer entered into the ears of the Lord. Such was the prayer of devout
Hannah, of whom it is said, 1. Sam. 1. 13.
she spoke in her heart: only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard.
Hannah spoke not alowd when she prayed, only her heart prayed, and that
fervently. S. Luke records, that a Luke 7. 37. 38.
woman in the city which was a sinner, that notorious sinful woman, stood at
Christ's feet behind him weeping. And by the ans^ere of our Savior Christ
unto her, Ver. 48.
Thy sins are forgiven; it is evident, that she wept for her sins, and prayed
earnestly for the pardon of her sins, yet we hear no words that she uttered,
only her eyes wept, and her heart prayed. Leg^mus quae ^^cit, no^ l^gimu^,
quae dixit. Stell. in Lu.
We read says one, what she did, but we read not what she said. This duty of
praying, is performed oftimes more with sighs and groans, then with words; and
more with weeping, then with speaking.

Now, whereas in praying, it is required that we pray fervently; the
consideration hereof, serves to stir up nor yet so hot in devotion, as to
make an earnest Prayer. But such luke w^rme Prayers are ineffectual, and
obtain nothing at Gods hands; but the prayer that obtains any thing of God,
is the effectual, fervent, and earnest Prayer. The fervent Prayer is such as
is able to pierce the clouds; neither can the stormy winds blow it away, nor
the thick clouds keep it back, nor yet the spirits in the air, hinder the
passage of a fervent, earnest, and devout prayer; but it mounteth up to the
throne of grace, and returns not empty of the blessings of God. Whosoever
then would obtain mercy with the Lord, and find grace to help in time of
need, must come to the Lord by Prayer; but he must not content himself to
pray sleightily, and carelessly, but fervently, and earnestly; striving with God
by earnest Prayer, as Jacob wrestled with the Angel, and prevailed: to whom he
also said, Genesis 32. 26.
I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. Haec vis Deo grata est. Chrysostom.
in Mat. Hom. 23
This forcible striving with God by earnest Prayer, is, as a Father says,
acceptable and well pleasing unto God. Like as a Father, when his child comes
unto him to crave something of him, delights to hear his child how
earnestly he calls upon him, father, good father, I pray you Father; and to
see how he will hang upon his Father, and follow him, and will give him no rest
till he have what he desires: and though the child's importunity be a trouble
to the Father, yet for the love that he has to his child, he counts it no
trouble, but rather delights in it, and in the end, grants his child what
he desired: so almighty God, our heavenly Father, is delighted and well
pleased, when we come unto him to crave any lawful, and needful thing; if we
crave it earnestly; crying, Abba, father, heavenly father, merciful father:
and then the Lord, because he is delighted in us his children, and knows our
need; of his goodness and mercy, will hear our prayers, and grant our
requests. And this of feruencie in Prayer.

The sixth thing required in making our Prayers, is Perseverance in prayer; not
ceasing nor fainting in prayer, Perseverance, or continuing in Prayer.
but holding out, and continuing in prayer, till the Lord be gracious unto us,
and hear us, and grant our requests. And to this perseverance in Prayer, the
Scripture persuades us both by testimonies, and examples. S. Paul exhorts to
Coless. 4. 2.
continue in Prayer. And to 1. These. 5. 17.
pray without ceasing. And S. Luke records that Jesus Luke 18. 1.
spoke a parable to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint.
By which phrases, of continuing in prayer, praying without ceasing, and not
fainting in prayer; the holy Ghost gives us to understand, that if we would
have the Lord to hear us, and grant our requests, we must pray with
perseverance, we must continue in Prayer, we must not wax faint in praying,
neither cease praying till the Lord favorably in mercy look upon us, and
hear us. And of this perseverance in prayer, we have examples in the
Scriptures: David prays thus, Psalm. 13. 1.
How long will thou forget me (O Lord) for ever? How long will thou hide thy
face from me? In that David says, how long will thou forget me O Lord, for
ever? how long will thou hide thy face from me? It is evident, that David being
in trouble, and distress, prayed unto the Lord for help and deliverance, and
that long, and often before he was heard: he prayed, but the Lord delayed the
time, and deferred to help him; yet David fainted not, neither waxed weary in
praying, but prayed still; he continued in prayer, though it was long before
the Lord heard him. How we ought to persevere and continue in prayer without
ceasing, and not to faint in Prayer, our Savior shows in the parable of the
widow, who had a suite to an unrighteous Judge, crying, and saying unto him,
Luke 18. 3 4. 5. 6. 7.
Avenge me of mine adversary. And he would not for a while: but afterward he
said within himself, though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this
widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming, she
weary me. And the Lord said, hear what the unjust Judge says, and shall not
God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear
long with them? The woman of Canaan endured three repulses, yet would not be
repelled, nor driven back; she had three denials, but would take no denial;
neither would cease following after Christ, still calling upon him, and crying
unto him, Mat. 15. 25.
Lord help me: till in the end, the Lord answered her graciously, Ver. 28.
O woman, great is thy faith: he it unto thee even as thou will. S. Paul in his
temptation, prayed with perseverance, for he says, 2. Cor. 12. 8.
for this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And
our Savior Christ, in his agony, prayed thrice that the cup might pass from
him; for its said, that he Mat. 26. 44.
prayed the third time, saying the same words. And this perseverance, and
continuing in Prayer, is fitly resembled by Moses holding up his hands when
Israel fought against Amalek. For it is said, that Exodus 17. 11.
when Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand,
Amalek prevailed. Moses holding up his hands, resembles a devout man praying
with feruencie, and earnestly making supplication unto God: and the letting
down of his hands, figureth a man fainting in prayer; and as it was with the
Israelites when they fought against the Amalekits, that so long as Moses held
up his hands, they prevailed; and when he let down his hands, Amalek
prevailed; so it is with us in our Prayers: As long as we continue in prayer,
holding up our hands, lifting up our hearts, and earnestly calling upon the
Lord for help, we prevail against our spiritual enemies, the flesh, the
world, and the Devil; and in the end shall have deliverance, and shall find
the Lord ready and willing to help us: but if we faint, and wax weary in
praying, and are unwilling to pray any longer, then we are in danger to be
overcome of our enemies; and then we deprive our selves of those blessings, and
helps which otherwise the Lord in mercy would have bestowed upon us, if we
had continued in Prayer.

The consideration of this perseverance, and continuing in Prayer, serves

First, for instruction; to teach us to wait upon the Lord David exhorts,
saying, To wait upon the Lord for help and deliverance.
Psalm. 37. 7.
Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him. And the Psalmist says, Psalm.
130. 5.
I wait for the Lord, my soul does wait. And the Church in distress, prays
thus; Isa. 33. 2.
O Lord, be gracious unto us, we have waited for thee. This is illustrated by a
similitude of men-seruants and maid servants, waiting upon their masters and
mistresses: Psalm. 123. 2.
behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as
the eyes of a maiden, unto the hand of her mistress: so our eyes wait upon the
Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us.

Secondly, this serves to reprove all such as are impatient Against those who
are impatient in their trouble, and will not stay the Lords leisure.
Lords leisure, and wait till the Lord have mercy upon them, and send them
deliverance: like to the Bethulians, who, being besieged by the enemy, limited
the Lord; prescribing him a set time wherein to help them, namely, the space
of Iudeth. 7. 30. 31.
five days, and if the Lord did not send them help within that space, then
they would yield up the city into the hand of the enemy. But this their doing
was sinful; and Iudeth reprooueth them for it, saying, Iudeth. 8. 14. 15. 16.
17.
nay my brethren, provoke not the Lord our God to anger. For if he will not
help us within these five days, he has power to defend us when he will, even
every day, or to destroy us before our enemies. Do not bind the counsels of
the Lord our God, for God is not as man, that he may be threatened, neither is
he as the son of man that he should be wavering. Therefore let us wait for
salvation of him, and call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice if
it please him. Not to wait on the Lord for deliverance; but to prescribe the
Lord a time to help us, is a provoking of God, a binding of the counsels of
God, a tempting of God, and a limiting of the Lord, who, may not be limited;
for God, though he be Liberalis est Deus, s^d liber.
liberal and bountiful to bestow his blessings upon us, and to help us; yet
he is free, he is not tied nor bound to man, neither is he to be limited and
appointed by man. Say not thou then, I have prayed so long, and so often, and
yet the Lord does not hear, does not deliver me, what should I pray any
longer? take heed, be not of this mind; let no such words proceed out of thy
mouth; for if the Lord do defer to hear us, and help us when we call upon
him in the time of our need; The Lord often deferreth the granting of our
requests.
it is not because the Lord is either unable, or unwilling to help us, but for
other ends; as

First, to exercise us in praying, to cause us to pray more 1 To exercise us in
praying.
fervently, and to make us cry and call upon the Lord more earnestly, as did
the woman of Canaan.

Secondly* the Lord does not always yield to grant 2 That we may receive the
blessings of the Lord with greater joy and thankfulness.
us our requests at the first asking, but oftentimes suffers us to ask once,
and twice, yea, many times, before he be pleased to answer us, and grant our
requests; that when he hears us, and grants us the things which we prayed
for, we may receive the same with greater joy and thankfulness. That as when
we wanted such blessings, we prayed earnestly; so when we have received his
blessings, we should praise him heartily. And this also of Perseverance in
Prayer.

CHAP. XVI. Of praying in Faith: also of praying according to the will of God;
and in the name of Christ.
THe seventh thing required in making our prayers, is to pray in Faith,
without doubting. When 7 To pray in Faith.
we pray, we must believe that God will hear us, and grant our requests being
lawfully made. Of this, our Savior Christ says, Mat. 21. 22.
all things whatsoever you shall ask in Prayer, believing, you shall receive.
If you believe, you shall receive. So says S. James, Iam 1. 5. 6. 7
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men
liberally, and vpbraideth not, and it shall be given him. But how must he ask?
the Apostle answers, let him ask in faith, nothing wavering: for he that
waueth is like a wave of the Sea, driven with the wind, and tossed. For let not
that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. And St Paul says,
1 Timothy 2. 8.
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without
wrath, and doubting. This is the trust, and confidence, that we have in making
our prayers unto God, that God is able to hear us, and grant our requests, and
also that he is willing; and for his truth and promise sake, for his goodness
and mercy sake, he will hear us, and grant the things which we lawfully crave
at his hands; in this confidence, the Leper said unto Christ, Mat. 8. 2.
Lord if thou will, thou can make me clean, Potentiam credo, veluntatem
spero.
I believe thou can, I hope thou will make me clean. Thus ought we to pray
in faith, without doubting.

Here, they are reproved, who are fearful, and faint-hearted Against those,
who in praying are weak-hearted, and doubtful of being heard.
to approach to the throne of grace: the distrustful man says thus to
himself; to what end should I pray? God does not hear me, and if I make my
supplication, the Lord will not deliver me. And by reason of these distrustful
thoughts, he either prays not, or prays but slightly, and weakly,
fainting, and doubting. But hearken o man, and consider: God says unto thee,
Psalm. 50. 15.
call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee: and Christ makes
thee this promise, Mat. 21. 22.
all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, (if you believe) you
shall receive. O then cease not to pray to the Lord for help and deliverance,
because the Lord bids thee pray, and promises deliverance; but pray that thou
may have faith, to believe that the Lord will help thee, and deliver thee.
For if thou be faint-hearted, and believe not, thou shall obtain nothing. And
the reason wherefore thou art not helped, and delivered, is either because thou
do not pray, or not pray in faith, not believing, but doubting. Hence it is,
that the wise son of Sirach says. Ecclus. 2. 13.
Woe unto him that is faint-hearted, for he believes not, therefore shall he
not be defended.

The eight thing required in the manner of making an 8 To pray according to the
will of God.
acceptable prayer unto God, is, that we make our prayers according to the will
of God. Concerning which, Saint John says, 1 Ioh. 5. 14.
This is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing
according to his will, he hears us. Here is a promise, that if we ask at
Gods hands things needful forvs, he will hear us: but here is also a
condition set down, we must ask according to his will. Which asking according
to the will of God, stands in two things. Standing in two things.


First, that we pray for spiritual, and heavenly things, 1 Asking spiritual
things simply, and temporal things conditionally.
for graces accompanying salvation, as for faith, and knowledge, and
repentance, and godly sorrow, for pardon and remission of sins, for hope, and
charity, for patience, and humility, and for all other graces, needful for
our souls health, as also for increase of grace; simply, and absolutely: for
these things are necessary to our salvation; and we are assured that God will
grant us these things, if we pray for them aright. God is willing to bestow
upon us graces in this life, which may bring us to glory in the life to come.
Wherefore it is, that St James says, Iam. 1. 5.
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men
liberally, and vpbraideth not, and it shall be given him. This wisdom is a
spiritual gift of God, which God gives to the sons of men, to make them wise
to salvation; and if any one lack this true wisdom, the Apostle says, let
him ask of God, and it shall be given him. Thus we may ask spiritual and
heavenly things: but temporal benefits, and things that pertain to this
present life, as food, raiment, meat, and drink, wealth and riches, corn and
cattle, houses, and lands, honor and preferment, as also deliverance in the
time of trouble, sickness, and any affliction; these things, and such as
these, we must ask and pray for, conditionally; according to Gods will: if it
be the will of God to grant them unto us: and if the things which we pray for,
be good and expedient for us. Thus the Leper prayed to be cleansed, Mat. 8 2.
Lord, if thou will, thou can make me clean. And thus our Savior himself
prayed that the cup might pass from him; saying, Mat. 26. 39.
O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not
as I will, but as thou will. And again he prays, saying, ^er. 42.
O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy
will be done. Thus we are to pray according to the will of God; asking
temporal things with condition; for the Lord is wiser then man, and the Lord
knows what things are needful for us, better then we our selves; like as the
skillful Physician knows better what is good for the sick man, then the
sick man himself.

Secondly, that we may pray according to the will of God, 2 Referring our will
to Gods will.
we must rest our selves so upon the will and good pleasure of our God, that we
be content to refer to Gods will, and his good pleasure, both what he will
give us, and how much he will give us; as also when he will hear us, and how
he will help us: for as S. Peter says, 2. Pet. 2. 9.
the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations: the Lord knows
both the time when, and the manner how to deliver us out of affliction: and
therefore, we should wait upon the Lord, and rest upon him, not only for
deliverance, but also for the time when, and the manner how he will deliver us.

Now, seeing that we are to make our Prayers according to the will of God, to
ask such things as are agreeable to Against those who consider not whether the
things which they pray for, be according to Gods will.
his will, and to refer our selves wholly to the will of God, for the granting
of our requests: the consideration hereof, serves to reprove those, who are
ready, and forward enough to ask at Gods hands such things as they stand in
need of; but little consider, whether the things which they crave, be agreeable
to Gods will; they only set their minds upon the obtaining of the things
which they desire. This was the sin of the Israelites in asking them a King
to rule over them, for they said unto Samuel, 1. Sam. 8. 5, 6.
make us a King to judge us, like all the Nations. Give us a King. They do not
ask a King, if it please the Lord, if it be according to the will of God, and
if it seem good in the eyes of the Lord; but they cry, Give us a King: and
when Samuel told them, that their petition was displeasing unto God, and had
certified them also, if the Lord did give them a King, what manner of one he
should be, and how hardly he would deal with them, yet Ver. 19.
they refused to obey the voice of Samuel, and they said, Nay, but we will have
a King over us. For this cause, our Savior Christ blames the mother of
Zebedees children, and her two sons: she comes to Christ making a petition
in the behalf of her two sons, saying, Mat. 20. 21. 22
grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the
other on the left in thy kingdom. But Jesus answered, and said, ye know not
what ye ask: Many there are, who with the mother of Z^bedees children, and
her sons, ask they know not what and speed no better then they did. For it is
just with God to deny men their petitions, when they ask according to their
own will, and not according to the will of God. Or if God do hear them
according to their own will, and grant what they require, it is in his anger,
and wrath; a^ he gave Israel a Hos. 13. 11.
King in his anger And as he gave them Quails to satisfy their lust, Psalm.
78. 29. 30. 31.
they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire. They
were not estranged from their lust: but while their meat was yet in their
mouths, the wrath of God came upon them, etc. They had sour sauce to their
dainty meat. Thus God grants many their own desire, and hears them
Secundum volunt item, sed non ad vtilitatem.
according to their own will, but not so as it may be for their good. He
gives them what they desire, but it is in his wrath, he gives them their
wishing, but sends some judgment after it; and he gives them a blessing,
but it is without the blessing; and that because they did not ask according to
his will. Wherefore, let it be our care, in praying, to ask such things as are
agreeable to the will of God; and for the obtaining of the things which we
desire, to refer our selves to Gods holy will, patiently waiting the Lords
leisure, and to say with out blessed Savior, Mat. 26. 39.
not as I will, but as thou will. And Luke 22. 42.
not my will, but thine be done. And this of praying according to the will of
God.

The ninth, and last thing required in making our prayers, 9 To pray in the
name of Christ.
is, so to pray, as that we offer up our supplications and prayers, our
intercessions, and giving of thanks in the Name of Jesus Christ: Concerning
which, our Savior speaks thus: John 14. 14.
If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. And again he says,
Ioh. 16. 23.
Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. He says
not, whatsoever you shall ask the Father, he will give it you; but with this
addition, in my name. Whatsoever we shall ask the Father in the name of
Christ, he assures us, the Father will give it us. Whatsoever request we have
to make unto God, we must ask it at Gods hands for Christ's sake. The reason
is, because that we of our selves are unworthy, and deserve nothing at Gods
hands, except it be through the mediation of Jesus Christ, and our prayers are
no whit acceptable unto God, except they be offered up in the name of Jesus
Christ. For this cause, Christ is called the Revel. 8. 3.
Angel having the golden censer, offering up unto God the sweet Incense of
the prayers of the Saints, acceptable unto God through the mediation of Christ.
Christ is likened unto the Genesis 28. 12.
ladder which Jacob saw, which stood on the earth, and whose top reached to
heaven, and the Angels of God (were) ascending, and descending on it. For
Christ Jesus our Mediator, is the only way, and means, whereby our prayers
do ascend up to heaven, and appear before the throne of God; and by whom also
the blessings of God do descend down upon us. For it is not of our deserving,
but for the merits, and through the mediation of Jesus Christ, that we receive
all good blessings whatsoever, whether for our souls, or bodies.

The use hereof, is threefold.

First, for instruction: Seeing that we are to make our To conclude our prayers
in the name of Christ.
prayers in the name of Christ; it teaches us to conclude our Prayers, whether
public, or private, always in the name of Jesus Christ.

Secondly, for confutation of their error, who think Against those who rely
upon the intercession of Saints.
name of Christ, who prefer their petitions to the heavenly King, in the name
of some Saint, hoping thereby to have their prayers heard: this has no warrant
in Gods word: nay rather, Gods word teaches us the contrary: as expressly,
in that saying of our Savior Christ, Whatsoever ye shall ask tho Father in my
name, he will give it you. He says not, whatsoever you shall ask in the name
of an Angel, or in the name of any Saint, as Abraham, Isaak, or Jacob, or the
virgin Marie, or Peter, or Paul; but, whatsoever you shall ask in my name. The
holy name Jesus, is the name, whereby we are only saved; and there is no other
name under heaven, whereby we can be saved: and the name Jesus, is the name in
which God is well pleased, and accepts our petitions, which we make
according to his will.

The Scripture points us out no more Mediators but one: 1. Tim. 2. 5.
there is one God, says S. Paul, and one Mediator between God and men, the
man Christ Jesus. And we acknowledge, according to the Scriptures, no more
Intercessours but one, only Christ Jesus. Romans 8. 34.
It is Christ says the Apostle, that died, yea rather that is risen again,
who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. To
which agrees the saying of St Augustine, who, in his Meditations says, Quem
enim alium dirigam interc^ssorem (...) nescio, nisi hunc, qui est propitiatio
pro peccatis nostris, qui sedet ad dextram t^am interpellans pro nobis. Aug.
Medit. c. 5.
I know none other whom I may make my intercessour unto thee, but only him
(even Jesus Christ) who is the propitiation for our sins, who fitteth at thy
right hand, making intercession for us.

Thirdly, this ministers consolation unto us; for Consolation, that praying in
the name of Christ, God will grant our lawful requests.
hereby we have assurance, that if we pray unto God in the name of Jesus
Christ, we shall obtain our lawful requests, made according to the will of
God. For so has Christ promised, Job. 16. 23.
Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. He says,
he will give it you. There Is the promise, which God will perform for Christ's
sake. To call upon God, in the name of his son Christ Jesus, is acceptable,
and well pleasing unto God, Quid euim est dulcius quam genitorem in nomine
vnigeniti inuocare? patrem in recordatione filij ad pietatem in flectere? Aug.
Medit. c. 5.
For what can be more pleasing, as S. Augustine again says, to a Father, then
for the offender to use the mediation of his son, and to entreat favor in
the name of his only begotten son? though the father cannot endure to look
upon the offender, yet he is pleased to look upon him for his sonne^ sake, the
loving countenance of the son, does pacify the anger of the father toward the
offender. It is so with us; we are offenders, such as by our sinful life, have
offended our heavenly father, and we have no means to pacify his wrath,
neither have we any assurance to obtain any favor at Gods hands, whom we have
so angered by our sins, but only by the mediation and intercession of Christ
Jesus, the only begotten son of God, and our alone, and only Savior. And
we have sure confidence, that we shall speed well in our requests which we make
unto God in the name of Christ, and that what we ask the father in his name he
will give it us, because Christ is at the right hand of God, and makes
intercession for us; as says the Apostle, Heb 7. 25.
He is able to save them to the uttermost, that come unto God by him, seeing he
ever lives to make intercession for them.

CHAP. XVII. Of the Efficacy, and power of prayer.
THE Eight thing in the treatise of Prayer, is concerning the Efficacy and
power of prayer. 8 The Efficacy and power of prayer.


That the prayer of a righteous man, framed after the manner prescribed, is of
great efficacy and prevails much with God; is evident by that saying of S.
James, Iam. 5. 16.
The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. And how much
the fervent prayer of a righteous man avails, will appear more evidently, if
we consider it in a twofold respect; for the fervent Twofold. For. Prayer

has wrought wonders,

First, in the heavens above, and that

First, in the Firmament, causing the Sun and Move 1 In the heavens. as,
to stay their course, and to stand still. So effectual was the prayer of
Joshua. For he prayed that the 1 sh. 10. 12. 13.

Aialon. And the Lord heard his prayer, and the Sun stood still, and the
Moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Yea,
the Sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about
a whole day.

Secondly, in the Regions of the Air; and 2 In the regions of the air. as.


First, in the uppermost region; causing fire to descend down from heaven; so
at the prayer of Elijah the Prophet, 1 King. 18 36. 37. 38.
The fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, 1 In the
uppermost region:
and the wood and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in
the trench.

Secondly, in the lower regions; as to stay the heavens from rayning a long
time together; and again, to open the windows of heaven, and to bring down
rain. Such 2 In the lower regions,
power had Elias also, as witnesses S. James Iam. 5. 17. 18.
Elias was a man subject to the like passions as we are, and he prayed
earnestly that it might not reign; and it rained not on the earth by the space
of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave
rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit, thus in the heavens above.

Secondly, Prayer has auailed much in the wat^rs, to stay their violent force
from drowning the servants of 2 In the waters.
the Lord; which efficacy was in the prayer of Jonah, who being in the Jon. 1.
17.
Belly of the fish three days, and three nights: Yea, even Ion 2. 1. 2. 3. 5.
10.
In the deep in the midst of the seas; the floods compassing him about, all
the billows and waves passing over him, and the weeds being wrapped about his
head, then he prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fishes belly. And the
Lord heard him, and the Lord spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon
the dry land.

Thirdly, in the earth; causing springs of waters to appear 3 In the earth.
in dry places; yea, making the hard rocks to gush out water in abundance. As
at the prayer of Moses: for when the people murmured for want of water, Exodus
17. 4. 56.
Moses cried unto the Lord, And the Lord answered him, and bade him smite the
rock, and there should come water out of it, that the people might drink, and
Moses did so, in the sight of the Elders of Israel.

Lastly, prayer has been of force to cast out the fiercest 4 In hell over the
evil spirits.
Devils of hell: when our savior Christ had cured the Iunatike, and had cast
out the Devil, which thing the disciples could not do, and demanded of
Christ, saying, Mat. 17. 19. 20. 21.
Why could not we cast him out? Jesus said unto them, Because of your
unbelief; etc. Howbeit this kind goes not out, but by prayer and fasting.
Thus prayer avails extraordinarily.

much; both for

First, prayer avails much, for the remoouing of evil from the body, whether
it be 1 Remoouing evils from the Body. Twofold.

happen to his temporal state: as from the sword, famine pestilence, or any
grievous plague. From the sword, and from the hand of the enemy, as it
delivered Hezekiah king of Judah from the power of Senacheri^ King of Assyria;
for having received a most blasphemous Letter from the King of Assyria, he 2.
Kin. 19. 14. 15
went up into the house of the Lord, and sp^ead it before the Lord. And
Hezekiah prayed before the Lord: and the Lord heard his Prayer, and his prayer
so prevailed with the Lord, that the Lord sent his Angel to fight for Hezekiah
against his enemies, for Ve^. 35.
it came to pass that night, that the Angel of the Lord went out, and sinote
in the camp of the Assyrians, an hundred fourscore and five thousand. Prayer
also avails much in the time of famine; and dearth; wherefore the Lord says,
Isa. 41. 17.
when the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue
fails for thirst, I the Lord will hear them; as if he had said, if there be
scarcity, and dearth in the land, let the people pray unto me, and I will
hear them. So also in the time of plague, and pestilence, prayer avails much
with God, for the turning away of the heavy hand of the Lord; thus the plague
was stayed in Israel, when Number. 16. 46. 47. 48.
Aaron took his censer, and put sire therein from the Altar, and put on
incense, and made an atonement for the people, he stood between the dead and
the living, and the plague was stayed. This sweet incense, is holy and devout
Prayer, ascending up to the throne of God, able to stay the plague. And prayer
avails against any other judgment that hangs over a people, as the
Ninevites elcaped a great judgment threatened against them, and the Lord was
moved to Ion. 3. 8. 9. 10.
turn away from his fierce anger, when the Lord saw that they repented, and
cried mightily unto God. Thus prayer avails in common calamities:

Secondly, Prayer avails much in private afflictions; 2 Private afflict^ons.
to help and deliver us in time of peril and danger, in time of sickness,
and from the danger of death. David shows us, that being in distress, he
prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord heard him, Psalm. 18. 6.
In my distress says he, I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God; he
heard my v^ice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his
ears. And prayer is an effectual means to preserve and save in the time of
sickness; so S. James says, Iam. 5. 15.
the Prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up: by
this means it pleased the Lord to save Hezekiah's life, for Hezekiah being Isa.
38. 1. 2 4. 5.
sick unto death, prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord heard his prayer, and
added unto his days fifteen years. Thus prayer avails for the remoouing of
evil from the body, and temporal state:

Secondly, prayer also avails much for the procuring 2 Procuring good to the
body.
of good to the body, and temporal state; for by prayer it is, that the Lord
gives us things needful for this present life; as food and raiment, and
things convenient for the preservation of this life. S. James says, Iam. 1. 17.
Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from
the Father of lights: and again he says, Jam. 4. 2. 3.
ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye
fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. Ye ask and receive not,
because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. Where, the
Apostle shows, that the way, and means to obtain good things, blessings,
and benefits at the hands of God, is by Prayer; asking them of God, but so as
we ask aright, and ask things needful to a good end, and not prodigally to
waste and consume them upon our lusts. Thus prayer avails concerning the
body, and temporal state:

Secondly, Prayer also avails greatly for the good 2 In regard of the soul.
And that,
of the soul: and that both for the

Remoouing of evil, and

Procuring of good. 1 Remoouing evil. As


First, for the remoouing of evil. And first, prayer is a means to remove
away our sins from us, which stand as a cloud between God and us, to hinder
good 1 Our sins.
things from us, separating between God and us, and provoking Gods wrath
against us; wherefore, Hezekiah being recovered from his sickness, and praising
God for his deliverance, says, Isa. 38. Ver. 2. 3 And 17.
thou have in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; for
thou have cast all my sins behind thy back.

Secondly, Prayer is effectual and powerful to help 2 Temptations.
us against temptations, and to deliver us from that evil one. So our Savior
teaches us to pray, Mat. 6. 13.
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. And so he exhorts us
to pray, Mat. 26. 41.
watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.

Thirdly, Prayer is powerful to help us in the evil 3 The te^^our of death
and judgment.
and perilous times, to free our souls from the danger of death, and the
judgment to come; that neither death shall suddenly come upon us, nor the day
of the Lord take us unawares. Which our Savior shows us in this exhortation,
Luke 21. 36.
Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to
escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son
of man. Thus prayer avails for the remoouing of evil from the soul.

Secondly, prayer avails much for the procuring of 2 Procuring Good. As
good things to the soul; as first, mercy, pardon and forgiveness; David in
his Prayer confesses his sin, 1 Mercy, pard^n, and forgiveness.
saying, Psalm. 32. 5.
I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid; I said I
will confess my transgressions to the Lord, and (it follows) thou forgauest
the iniquity of my sin. David confessed his sin, and prayed for the pardon
of his sin, and the Lord heard his Prayer, and pardoned his sin. So S.
James says, Iam. 5. 15.
the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and
if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.

Secondly, Prayer is a means to obtain all graces necessarily 2 All graces
necessary for our salvation.
accompanying salvation. For Iam. 1. 17.
every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from
the Father of lights. Our Savior Christ says, Mat 7. 7.
Ask, and it shall be given you: and S. James says, Iam. 1. 5.
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men
liberally, and vpbraideth not, and it shall be given him.

Thirdly, Prayer is effectual not only for the obtaining 3 Increase of Grace.
of grace, but likewise for the increase of grace: the Apostles pray, Luke 17.
5.
Lord, increase our Faith. And S. Paul prays for the Ephesians, that God
would Ephe. 3. 16. 17. 18. 19.
grant them according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with
might, by his Spirit in the inner man, that Christ might dwell in their hearts
by faith, that being rooted and grounded in love, they might be able to
comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and
height, and to know the love of Christ. Which passes knowledge, that they
might be filled with all the fullness^ of God. And they that are strengthened
by the Spirit in the inner man, having Christ dwelling in their hearts by
faith, and are growing, and increasing in grace in this life, shall assuredly
attain to glory in the life to come. Prayer then as it remooueth evil, ^o it
procures good to the soul, mercy, grace; yea, increase of grace; and with
grace, glory, the perfection of Grace. Such is the efficacy of Prayer.

The consideration of which efficacy, and power of To use prayer in time of
need as a sure defense.
to flee unto God by Prayer; to lay hold on prayer, as a man would on his
shield and buckler. For prayer is a most sure defense in all troubles
whatsoever; It is a defense against tribulations outward, and temptations
inward; It helps the body, and cures the soul; it prevails both in heaven
and in earth: concerning which, the exhortation of the Apostle S. Paul is to be
received, and embraced; Ephe. 6. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18.
take unto you, says he, the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to
withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore,
having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breast plate of
righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of
peace. Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation,
and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Praying always with all
Prayer and supplication in the Spirit: A Christian that is thus armed, having
the girdle of truth about his loins, having on the breast plate of
righteousness, and his feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of
peace, having the shield of faith before him, the helmet of salvation upon his
head, having the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, and being
prepared to pray with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit; Such a one is
able to stand against the adversary the Devil, and all spiritual
wickedness; and such a one shall prevail against his spiritual enemies; yea,
such a one shall prevail with God himself, for any petition that he shall
make, so far as it shall be good for him. For the effectual fervent Prayer
of a righteous man avails much.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the helps and furtherances of Prayer. Of the first help, the
Spirit of God.
THe ninth thing in the Treatise of Prayer, is, of 9 The helps and furtherances
of Prayer. Three.
the helps and furtherances of Prayer: and they are three:

The first, is Gods holy Spirit: of which Saint Paul says, Romans 8. 26. 27.
Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities; 1 Gods holy Spirit. And
for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it self
makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that
searches the hearts, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes
intercession for the Saints, according to the will of God. For this cause, the
Spirit of God is called the spirit of supplications by the Prophet Zachary,
Zach. 12. 10. The holy spirit helps us in our prayers three ways.
I will power upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
the spirit of grace and supplications: Now, the Spirit of God helps us in our
prayers, three ways;

First, teaching us to pray aright; to ask things lawful, and according to
the will of God. For we know not, 1 Teaching us to pray aright.
says the Apostle, what we should pray for as we ought: but the spirit it
self makes intercession for us with groanings, which cannot be uttered.

Secondly, in praying, we have many distractions, 2 Causing us to attend to
the things which we pray for.
wandering thoughts, and vain imaginations, which trouble us, and draw away our
minds; and herein the Spirit helps our infirmities: the Spirit helps us to
withdraw our minds from the world, and to draw up our hearts unto God; and
causes us to be more attentive upon the things that we pray for.

Thirdly, many are the afflictions, tribulations, and 3 Stirring up the heart
to pray with sighs and groaning.
temptations of the godly; they have many perturbations, which so trouble and
distemper them of times, that they find a marvelous unfitness to pray; and
if they set themselves to pray, cannot pray as they would; herein, the Spirit
helps our infirmities; in this case, the spirit it self makes intercession
for us with groanings, which cannot be uttered: that is, the Spirit does stir
up in the soul devoutly affected, holy sighs, and spiritual groanings which
cry alowd in the ears of the Lord.

This has use,

First, for instruction; to teach us, before we pray, to Before we pray to
crave the assistance of Gods holy spirit.
us, to guide, and direct us, to aid and help us in praying: to teach us what
to pray for, and how to pray; and to help us from wandering in our thoughts,
while we are praying.

Secondly, for consolation to the children of God; The righteous receive
comfort, that the good spirit of God helps them to pray.
find an unfitness to pray; and in regard of their infirmities, they have
many distractions, and wandering thoughts in praying; or by reason of great
grief, and heaviness of heart, they cannot utter words; or cannot express
their minds in such words as they desire; from hence they may gather
consolation, and comfort to their troubled souls, the Spirit of God is our
helper: the Spirit helps our infirmities: the Spirit causes us to pray, and
cry Romans 8. 15.
Abba, father: and if words fail, then the Spirit stirs up devotion in the
heart, causing the heart to pray, and cry alowd. The Spirit it self makes
intercession for us with groanings, which cannot be uttered.

CHAP. XIX. Of the second help, and furtherance of Prayer; Fasting.
REligious Fasting, is the second help, and furtherance 2 Religious fasting.
Therein three things.
of Prayer. In handling whereof, I will

First, show the right manner of observing a Fast: Secondly I will set down
the right use, and the chief ends of Fasting. Thirdly I will make it manifest,
that such fasting in the right manner, and to the right end, is a great help
and furtherance to our prayers.
To the first: In the right manner of observing a Fast, 1 The right manner of
observing a true fast. To which four things are required.
that it may please God; there are four things required.

First, when we fast, either publicly, or privately, it is required, that we
abstain from all meat and drink, so long as the fast is continued. The
greek word which signifies to (...).
fast, is as much in signification, as (...).
not to eat: giving us thereby to understand, that all the time of 1 To fast
from all meat.
our appointed fast, we must not eat. Thus we find David fasting till night,
and would eat nothing till the Sun was down, for 2. Sam. 3. 35.
when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day,
David swear, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread or ought
else, till the Sun be down. Notwithstanding, herein there must be a respect
had of the constitution of the body; how the body is able to continue, and
hold out the set time of the fast, without fainting: whtrefore one says,
Dometur caro, non interimatur.
let the flesh be tamed, not destroyed. For God does not require that we should
destroy the flesh, and hurt the body with fasting, but only, that we tame the
flesh, and humble the body.

Secondly, in fasting, we must abstain not only from 2 To abstain from all
sin.
all meat, but likewise from all sin: for want of which abstinence from sin,
the Lord dislikes of the abstinence from meat; the people say, Isa. 58 3. 4.
wherefore have we fasted, and thou see not? Wherefore have we afflicted our
soul, and thou take no knowledge? And the Lord answers them, behold, in
the day of your fast, you find pleasure, and exact all your labors. Behold, ye
fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness. The Lord
reproved them for fasting on this manner. Chrysostom says, Non ciborum
abstinentia ieiunium oporatur, sed abstinentia peccatorum. Chry. ad pop.
Antioch. Hom. 22.
It is not the bare abstaining from meats that makes the good fast, but
abstaining from sins, as well as from meats. Not only the stomach should
fast from meats, but all the members of the body should fast from sin; the
heart should fast from hatred and malice, and envy: the tongue should fast
from blasphemous words, from slanderous speeches, and from all corrupt and
filthy communication: the eyes should fast from beholding vanity: the ears
should fast from receiving tales: the hands should fast from working
wickedness: and the feet should fast from walking the paths of
unrighteousness. When we fast, we should not taste of the bread of malice,
that is sowreleauened bread: nor touch the dainty meat of carnal pleasure,
that is a surfeiting meat: but we ought to abstain from evil thoughts, sinful
words, and wicked deeds; for these are all unclean meat, and defile a man, as
says our Savior; Mat. 15. 19. 20
out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,
thefts, false-witnesse, blasphemies. These are the things which defile a man.

Thirdly, in the day of our fast, we ought to be exercised 3 To be exercised in
doing of good. Twofold.
in doing of good: doing works of

Piety, and

Charity:

First, works of Piety; spending that day, in holy, 1 To do works of piety.
and religious duties: as praying, and praising God, reading the Scriptures,
meditating upon the word of God, and his works: as did Cornelius, for he says
unto Peter, Act. 10. 30.
four days ago, I was fasting, until this hour, and at the ninth hour I
prayed in my house; by which it is evident, that Cornelius did not only fast,
but also prayed; when he fasted, he spent the day of his fast in holy thoughts,
in heavenly meditations, and devour prayer.

Secondly, upon the day of our fast, we ought to do works of Charity: to
feed the hungry, to cloth the 2 To do works of charity.
naked, to reliue the oppressed, etc. Isa. 58. 6. 7.
Is not this the fast that I have choson, says the Lord; to loose the bands of
wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free,
and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry,
and that thou bring the poor that are cast out, to thy house? When thou see
the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy self from thine
own flesh? That is a good fast, when as to our fasting, we join mercy, and
charity. No man should fast out of a covetous mind, to spare the more, but so
much as he spares by fasting, he should give to the poor.

Lastly, if our fast be a private fast, we must fast in secret; 4 To fast in
secret.
and not like the Pharisees, desire to be seen, and known of men that we
fast: It is sufficient that our fasting be known unto God: of this, our
Savior Christ says, Math. 6. 16. 17. 18
when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance; for they
disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast; verily I say
unto you, they have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy
head, and wash thy face: that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy
father which is in secret: and thy father which sees in secret, shall reward
thee openly. This, of the right manner of fasting.

The second thing in fasting, is, the right use, and end 2 The right end of
fasting. Twofold.
of fasting: The ends whereunto fasting serves, are two:

The first, is, to tame the flesh, and to bring the body under: S. Paul says,
1 Cor. 9. 27.
I keep under my body, and bring it 1 To tame the flesh.
into subjection: and how he kept under his body, and how he brought it into
subjection, he shows, when he says, I was 2 Cor. 11. 27.
in weariness and painfulnesse, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in
fastings often, in cold and nakedness. By these means, Paul humbled his
body, and brought it under.

The second end of fasting, i^ to humble the soul. Of 2 To humble the soul.
which David says, Psalm. 35. 13.
I humbled my soul with fasting. When the Lord humbles us with any cross,
and affliction, we should then humble our souls under the hand of God, by
fasting, and weeping, and mourning; as says the Lord by the Prophet Joel,
Joel. 2. 12.
therefore also now, says the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart,
and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning. These are the right ends
of fasting.

The third thing, which I observed in a religious fast, 3 Fasting how a help
and furtherance to Prayer.
is, that fasting after the right manner, and for the right ends, is a great
help and furtherance to our prayers. For

First, Fasting is a means to prepare us the better to prayer; and to stir
up our devotion the more, in calling 1 Stirring up our devotion.
upon the name of the Lord: it is said of Luke 2. 36. 37.
Anna an ancient widow in Israel, that she served God with fastings and
prayers night and day. She both fasted and prayed: the more diligently that
she fasted, the more devoutly she prayed So David says, Psalm. 35. 13.
I humbled my soul with fasting, and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
The humbling of his soul with fasting, gave good success to his Prayer.
Wherefore S. Chrysostom says, that Jeiunium est schola precum. Chry. de ^eiu^.
fasting is the School of Prayer. For, by fasting, we learn to pray. The
lean foul ouerflieth the Hawke; whereas the fat one is soon overtaken: so
the soul of a Christian that is humbled with fasting, does more easily mount
up toward heaven, by divine contemplation, and heavenly meditation, and more
easily escapes the temptation and snare of the Devil.

Secondly, fasting is a very great help and furtherance 2 Helping to get the
masterie over some great sin.
to Prayer; As when a sinner has committed some great sin, and heinous
transgression, or is troubled with some reigning sin; it may be, that Prayer
alone, will not serve to obtain remission, and to drive out that rebellious,
master-sinne; but to the end that such a sinner may more fully express his
true, and unfeigned repentance, by godly sorrow, and hearty mourning for his
sins; that he may the more humbly confess his sins, and more earnestly cry
and call for mercy, that he may turn away the displeasure of almighty God and
that he may obtain mercy, and find favor with God; he must join to his
Prayer, fasting. So 2. Sam. 12. 16.
David besought God for the child, and David fasted, and went in, and lay all
night upon the earth. David prayed for the child when it was sick, David
besought God for the child: and to the end that his prayer might be more
effectual, he humbled his soul with fasting. Fasting was a means to help,
and further his prayer. Some sins are like that kind of Devils, which could
not be cast out but by Mat. 17. 21.
Prayer and fasting. Some sins will not easily be cast out of men hearts, but
with much ado, with much sorrow, and many tears, with fasting and praying.

Now, whereas fasting performed after a right manner, Against those who cannot
endure to fast.
the consideration hereof, serves to reprove many in our age, and time, who
cannot away with fasting. And they are specially of two sorts: either
belly-gods; whose minds are so much upon their belly, and take so great
delight in pampering the flesh, that nothing almost can so disquiet and
discontent them, as that their ho^low paunch should miss it usual filling: or
they are nice, and dainty ones; such as fare delicately, and feed curiously:
fasting, say they, is an enemy to health; it filles the body full of wind,
upon which, many i^firmities may grow: but remember o man whosoever thou art,
and consider, that Dives who Luke 16. 19.
fared sumptuously every day, is now in Ver. 23. 24.
hell in torments, and cannot obtain so much as a drop of water to cool his
tongue. And hear all ye nice and daincie ones, who are so afraid of hurting
your bodies with fasting; are you so good Physicians for your bodies; and have
you no skill, nor care to physic your souls? Consider with your selves, that
2 Samuel 12. 16.
David a King fasted and mourned when his child was sick, and lay all night
upon the earth; that Esth. 4. 4. 16.
Esther a Queen fasted, and did neither eat nor drink three days, night nor
day: and that Luke 2 36. 37.
Anna a woman of great age, served God with fastings and prayers night and day.
But where is our fasting? or where shall we find one of an hundred fasting
truly, after the right manner, and to the ^ight ends? that can say with S. Paul
I have been 2. Cor. 11. 27.
Infastings often? or can say with David, Psalm. 109. 24.
My knees are weak through fasting: and my flesh fails of fatness? Some
hope to excuse themselves from fasting, saying each one for himself, though I
cannot fast, yet I can pray. but tell me not of thy devotion in praying, except
thou can also tell me of thy daily abstinence, and of some time set a part
for the taming of thy rebellious flesh, and bringing under thy body by
fasting: for fasting, is as has been declared a great help and furtherance to
prayer. and therefore, where abstinence is not used, and fasting neglected;
there doubtless, prayer either is not, or, is very weak, cold, and formal.
And this, of Fasting, as it is a help, and furtherance to prayer.

CHAP. XX. Of the Third help, and further ance of prayer; Divine Meditations.
GOdly Meditations are a third help and furtherance to our prayers: which I
will make manifest 3 Di^ine Meditations. considered
two ways:

First: in general: Secondly, by a particular enumeration of sundry profitable
meditations.
For the First: All godly meditations are a help, and 1 Generally.
furtherance to our prayers; as appears by the words of the prophet David,
saying, Psalm 39. 3. 4.
My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spoke I
with my tongue. Lord make me to know mine end, etc. and again he says, Psalm.
77. 1.
I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice and he gave ear
unto me. But before he called, and cried unto the Lord, he declares what
thoughts, and meditations he had, he Ver. 3.
remembered God, he could not sleep for thinking upon God, he Verse. 6. 7 8 9.
Communed with his own heart, and his spirit made diligent search will the Lord
cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more? etc. To this agrees the
saying of the son of Syrach, Ecclus. 39. 1.
He that gives his mind to the law of the most high, and is occupied in the
meditations thereof, will seek out the wisdom of all the ancient, etc. and it
follows, Verse. 5.
He will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him, and will
pray before the most high, and will open his mouth in prayer, and make
supplication for his sins. Thus, holy, and divine meditations generally
considered, are a help, and furtherance to our prayers.

Secondly, that divine meditations are a great help, and 2 Particularly.
Twofold.
furtherance to d^uout prayer, I will manifest, by the particular enumeration
of sundry divine meditations; which I reduce to these two heads.

Godly meditations concern either

God, or

Ourselves: 1 Concerning God. Threefold.


Those that concern God are of three sorts:

The first, concern his nature, or Attributes: The second his word: The third,
his works.
Touching the First: The consideration of the attributes 1 Concerning the
Attributes of God as.
of God, may stir us up to Invocation, either to pray to God, or to praise
God: as

First, when we think upon the eternity and immortality of God; the
consideration of this, that God is eternal, 1 Eterniue of God.
and immortal, that he is everlasting, without beginning, and without ending;
may raise our thoughts, to think on the life everlasting, which the eternal
and everliving God has prepared for his elect: and then to pray, that we may
live eternally with God in his eternal and everlasting kingdom.

Secondly, when we meditate on the power of God, and 2 Power of God.
consider that he made the world of nothing, and that he does what soever it
pleases him, both in heaven and earth; this should teach us to pray, that we
may depend upon Gods providence for the things of this present life, because
God is al sufficient; to pray, that in time of trouble, we may wait upon God
for deliverance, because he is a God of might and power, able to do all
things; yea, and to pray, that we may fear that powerful God; to seek to
please him, and to glorify him both in our bodies and in our solues, because
he is Mat. 10. 28.
able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

Thirdly, when we meditate on the justice of God, and 3 Justice of God.
consider how just the Lord is in all his ways, that he is a just God, hating
sin and iniquity, and punishing the transgressors, Exodus 34 7.
That will by no means clear the guilty; Nahum. 1. 3.
And will not at all acquit the wicked; the consideration hereof, should move
us to pray, that we may always Psalm 4. 4.
Stand in awe of his majesty, and not sin against him; lest we provoke his
wrath, and indignation against us.

Fourthly, when we think on the mercy of God, and 4 Mercy of God.
consider with our selves that God is Joel. 2. 13.
Gracious and merciful: this meditation, should move us to pray, that the Lord
would be gracious and merciful unto us, that he would show mercy upon us, and
pardon our sins; as David prays, Psalm. 51. 1.
Have mercy upon me, o God, according to thy loving kindness: according to the
multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.

Fifthly, when we think on the patience, long suffering, 5 Patience of God,
and forbearance of God, considering how long we have lived in our sins, how
often we have done wickedly, and still the Lord has showed his patience, and
long suffering; and, waiting for our repentance, has forborne to cut us off in
our sins; then we should pray, that this Romans 2. 4.
Goodness of God in forbearing us, might be a means to lead us to repentance.

Sixthly, when we think on the wisdom of God, and consider how wisely the
Lord has made all things, and 6 Wisdom of God.
how prudently, he rules and governs the world; this meditation should bring
us into admiration of the Lords wisdom, and cause us to lift up our hearts on
high, praising the Lord, and saying with David Psa. 104. 24.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom have thou made them all: Thus,
the devour soul may be carried aloft in heavenly meditations, concerning
these, and the rest of the Attributes of God; and in all, he may be stirred up
either to pray unto God or to praise God.

Secondly, the word of God, if we meditate thereon, 2 Concerning the word of
God.
will stir us up to prayer; whether we meditate on the law, or the Gospel.
If on the law, and the judgments threatened against impenitent sinners; the
consideration thereof may move us to pray, that we may have grace to repent us
of our sins, that so we may escape those judgments threatened against us: and
if we meditate on the Gospel, and consider the promises of mercy, and
salvation made to all that truly believe, and repent; the consideration
thereof, may move us to pray, that we may have grace to believe, and to
repent, that so we may be partakers of those sweet, and comfortable promises.

Thirdly, meditations upon the works of Creation, 3 Concerning the works of
Creation.
may stir us up to Invocation; and calling upon the name of the Lord; either
to pray to God for some blessing, or to praise God for his goodness: whether
we consider the things created

In heaven, or

In Earth, or Threefold.


In the Seas, and waters.

For so the Psalmist has distinguished the works of Creation, Psalm. 146. 6.
Which made heaven and earth, the Sea, and all that therein is.

Touching the First: The works of creation in the 1 In the heavens.
heavens, may stirie us up to call upon the name of the Lord. As when we think
on the Angels in heaven, and consider how they are Heb. 1. 14.
Ministering Spirits, ready to Psalm. 103. 20.
do his commandments, harkening to the voice of his word; It should cause us
to pray, that we also may endeauoure to lead such an angelical life here on
earth, as that we be careful to do the will, and obey the commandment of the
Lord, as the Angels do. When we look up to the heavens above, see the
firmament, and behold the Sun, the moon, and the stars, those glorious
lights; the beholding thereof, may cause us to praise God, for giving us
sinful men, such glorious-bright-shining lamps to lighten us in this vale of
misery; as also to pray, that after this life ended, we may shine in the
heavens, as those glorious lights now shine; for Daniel says, Dan. 3.
They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they
that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever. And our
savior Christ says, (...). 13. 43.
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their
father. When we look up, and see the clouds, we may meditate on Christ's
second Mat 24. 34.
Commming in the clouds of heaven, and how we shall be 1 These. 4. 17.
caught up in the clouds; and then pray, that we may be ready and prepared
Versab.
to meet the Lord in the air, that so we may ever be with the Lord. When we
hear it thunder, and see the lightning flash in our faces, we should meditate
on the mighty voice of the Lord, and the sound of the last Verse. 16.
trumpe, which shall cause the dead to rise; as also of the suddenness of
Christ's second coming to judgment, compared to Mat. 24. 27.
lightning, and then pray that we be not found sleeping, but, Luke 12. 36. 37
watching, like to good servants, which Watch and wait for the Lords coming.
When we see the dew and rain falling upon the earth, and perceive that
thereby, the dry earth is refreshed, brings forth herbs, and grass, and
corn for the use of man and beast; we may meditate on the dew of grace, and
the sweet, and comfortable rain of Gods word dropping upon the hearts of men,
and refreshing their souls; and then pray, that as the rain falling upon the
earth makes it fruitful; so the word of God dropping upon our hearts, may
soften our hard and stony hearts, and make us fruitful in good works. When
we consider the Math. 6. 26.
Fowls of the air, how they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into
barnes, and yet as our savior Christ says, Your heavenly father feeds them,
we may meditate on the providence of God; of his goodness providing for all
living creatures: and then pray, that we may rest upon God, and depend upon his
providence for the things of this present life; as food, and raigment, and all
other things needful for the preservation of our life; 1 Pet. 5. 7.
Casting all our care on God, and praying, that we may Math. 6. 33.
First seek the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, that all needful
thing: may be added unto us. Thus meditations to stir up our devotion, may be
taken from things above.

Secondly, from things on earth; as when we look 2 On the earth.
upon trees, and consider how some trees bear good, and plentiful fruit;
others, either no fruit, or bad fruit: we may meditate on the several sorts
of men in the world, and think with our selves, how good men are like good
trees, doing good, and bringing forth in their lives the fruit of holiness and
righteousness: contrariwise, that wicked men are like bad trees, yielding
either no fruit, or no good fruit: who, either live Idly, and are
unprofitable members, doing no good, or bringing forth Isa. 5. 4.
wild grapes, live wickedly, and do naughtily, offending God, and wronging
men: then pray, that we may be good trees bringing forth good fruit, because
John Baptist says, Math. 3. 10.
Every tree which brings not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into
the fire. When we look upon the grass in the field, or flowers in the garden,
we may be put in mind of our mortality, and shortness of life; for as the
Prophet Esaias says, Isa. 40. 6.
All flesh is grass, and all the goodlinesse thereof as the flower of the
field: The grass withers, the flower fades. And when we are thus meditating
on our mortality, and shortness of life, then we should pray, that we may at
all times be ready and prepared for the day of our death, for we are but as
the grass, and as the flower, and we know not how soon we may be cut down,
plucked up, and withered: when we think, or look on beasts and cattle, they
may stir up our devotion; as when we perceive the Isa. 1. 3.
Ox knowing his owner, and the ass his masters crib, as says the Prophet, we
should pray, that the Lord would make us obedient, and thankful unto God, lest
we be worse then the Ox, or the ass. When we see a Lamb brought to the
slaughter, and the sheep lying under the hand of the shearer, dumb; we may
meditate on the meekness and patience of Christ our Savior in suffering; for
as the Prophet Esaias says, Isa. 53. 7.
he was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is
brought as a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearer is
dumb, so he opens not his mouth; and then pray, that the Lord would endue us
with meekness, and patience in suffering. And when we see a sheep going
astray, we may meditate on the state of a sinner going astray like a lost
sheep; yea, on our own wandering from the commandments of the Lord; and pray
with David, saying, Psalm. 119. 17^
I have gone astray like a lost sheep, (O Lord) seek thy servant. Such like
meditations as these, to stir up our devotion, may be taken from these, and
other creatures, and works of God on earth.

Thirdly, from the waters, and things therein, we may 3 In the waters.
have meditations to raise our affections on high; as when we see, and consider
how every little brook runs into the greater river, and all rivers run into
the Sea whence they came; as Solomon says, Eccles. 1. 7.
All the rivers run into the Sea, yet the Sea is not full: unto the place
whence the rivers come, thither they return again: this should cause us to
think on our mortality; and to meditate, that even as the rivers run into
the Sea, whence they came, so do all men return to the earth whence they
came: and this meditation should put us in mind of our last end, and make us
to consider, how we even hasten to our grave; and then we should pray, that we
may be careful to remember our last end, and think much, and often, of the
place whence we came, and whither we are going. When we see fishes caught with
the angle, or taken in the net unawares, as they are securely swimming, and
seeking their prey; this may cause us to meditate on the suddenness of death,
and how it takes many unawares; according to the saying of Solomon, Eccles. 9.
12.
man knows not his time, as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as
the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an
evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them. And then we should be moved to
pray, that now while we live, and have time, and space to repent; we may so
prepare for death, that whenever that day comes it may not Luk 21. 34. 35.
36.
come upon us unawares. Hitherto of meditations that concern God:

The second sort of meditations, which may help, and 2 Concerning our selves.
Twofold.
further us in prayer, concern our selves; and they are of two sorts.

The first, are taken from the consideration of our 1 In regard of our state.
Threefold.
threefold state;

Past,

Present, and

To come.

First, in regard of the time past, we may meditate, and 1 Past, what we were.
call to mind, what we were; how we Ephe. 2. 3.
were by nature children of wrath. Psalm. 51. 5.
Shapen in iniquity, and conceived in sin. The meditation whereof, should
cause us to pray, that we may be renewed, may be made children of God, by
adoption and grace, and may be Ioh. 3. 3.
borne again, that so we may enter into the kingdom of God.

Secondly, in regard of the time present, we may seriously 2 Present, what we
are.
think with our selves; what we are: and we may find that we are first,
frail, brittle, even dust and ashes: which should humble us in prayer, and
cause us to say 1 Frail.
with Abraham, Genesis 18. 27.
I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes.

Secondly, sinful: having much natural corruption 2 Sinful.
within us, and prevailing against us; so that oftimes Romans 7. 19.
the good that we would, we do not; and the evil which we would not, that we
do Which meditation should cause us to pray with the Apostle, Ver. 24.
O wretched man that I am; who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

Thirdly, in regard of the time to come; we may meditate 3 To come: what we
shall be.
what we shall be. For we shall be,

In death, corruptible:

In the resurrection, glorious:

The one, may humble us; the other, may raise us up with consolation; and both,
may teach us to pray, that when our body dies, our soul may live: and at the
resurrection, both soul and body may live with God, and be with the Lord for
ever. These, and such like meditations, may be taken from the consideration of
our threefolde state:

Secondly, meditations concerning our selves, may be 2 In regard of our days
and hours.
taken from the days, and hours, and time, which God has given us here on
earth. We may every day, and every hour of the day, find some opportunity for
godly, and divine meditations. And that Three fold.


In the morning,

In the day time, and

In the evening.

First, in the morning; as when we awake, and see the 1 In the morning.
light, we may meditate on the Joh. 1. 9.
true light, which lights every man that comes into the world. And pray,
that we may 1. Cor. 15. 34.
awake to righteousness; and that the Lord would lighten our darkness, that
we may come out of the darkness of ignorance, to the true light. When we rise
from our beds, we may meditate on our twofold rising; from the death of sin,
in this life, and from our graves, at the last day: and then pray, that we may
no longer lie dead in our sins, but may rise from the death of sin, to the
life of righteousness; and that we may have our Reu. 20. 6.
part in the first resurrection, so that the second death may have no power
over us: but when we Dan. 12. 2.
awake out of the dust of the earth, we may rise to everlasting life. And when
we put on our apparel, we may fitly meditate on the putting on of the Ephe. 4
24.
new man: and pray, that we may Romans 13. 14.
put on the Lord Jesus Christ; and may Colos. 3. 12.
put on bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
long-sufferi^^ Such meditations as these, we may have in the morning.

Secondly, in the day time; in our affairs, and buisinesse 2 In the day time.
in the world, every man in his place, in his vocation and calling, may have
some good cogitations, and divine meditations: as the husbandman, when he is
plowing his ground, may meditate on the plowing, and Iere. 4. 3.
breaking up of the fallow ground of the heart: and when he sows his seed,
may think on the Luke 8. 11.
seed of Gods word; and then pray, that his own heart may be like good ground,
fitted, and prepared to receive the seed of Gods word, that it may enter into
his heart, may take deep rooting there, and bring forth the fruit of good
works. So also in the day time, when we are walking, going in the way, or
traveling; we may fitly have occasion to meditate on the course of our life;
and to think with our selves, that the course of our life is but as a way
wherein we walk; and that we are here on earth, but as 1. Pet 2. 11.
strangers and pilgrims; having Heb. 13. 14.
here no continuing city: and then pray, that we may have our hearts and
minds above, desiring to come to the end of our way; Ver. id.
seeking the city to come: even that Heb. 11. 10.
city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God. And traveling
toward Ver. 16.
a better country, that is, an heavenly. These, and such other meditations we
may have in the day time: 3 In the evening.


Thirdly, in the evening, we may meditate on the end of our life; and pray,
that we may be prepared for our last end. When we put off our apparel, we may
meditate on Ephe. 4. 22.
putting off the old man: and pray, that we may Ezekiel. 18. 31.
cast away from us all our transgressions, whereby we have transgressed: and
Heb. 12. 1.
lay aside every weight, and burden of sin. When we lie down in our beds,
we may fitly meditate on our lying in the grave; and pray, that as we rest our
weary bodies in our bed, that they may rise again with greater strength; so
when our bodies shall sleep in the dust of the earth, in the day of the
resurrection, they may awake, and rise up to glory. These, and such like
meditations, we may have in the evening. Thus, divine meditations do stir up
devotion, and further us in Prayer.

The consideration whereof, serves to reprove those, Against those who have
their thoughts much upon earthly things: and little upon heavenly things.
or his word, or his works; little upon heavenly things, but have their
hearts, and minds upon the world, and the things of the world; whose
affections are set upon the earth, and earthly things; and whose meditations,
and musings are for the most part, worldly, and carnal: such men may see, and
perceive how far they are from the state of true happiness, by David's
description of a blessed man; of whom he says, Psalm. 1. 1. 2.
his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law does he meditate day and
night. Wherefore, let such men be admonished to set their hearts less upon the
world, and more upon God: to have their minds and affections less on earthly
things, and more upon heavenly things; and as the Apostle exhorts, to Coloss.
3. 2.
set their affection on things above, not on things on the earth; that so,
heavenly thoughts, and godly meditations may stir up their feruencie in
prayer; without which, devotion is cold, dull, and drowsy.

CHAP. XXI. Of motives, and persuasions to Prayer.
THe tenth, and last thing in the Treatise of prayer, 10 Motives and
persuasions to Prayer.
is, concerning the motives, and persuasions, whereby every Christian may, and
ought to be persuaded, to practice so holy, and religious a duty; which
motives, I take

First, from the testimonies of holy Scripture: Four.
Secondly, from examples of holy and devout men. Thirdly, from the necessity
of Prayer. Fourthly, from the benefit thereof.
Touching the first: the Scripture makes it manifest, 1 Testimonies of
Scr^pture.
that God requires Prayer; the Lord calls us to the performance of this
duty; he bids us call upon him: Psalm. 50. 15.
call upon me (says the Lord) in the day of trouble: the Propher Esaias says,
Isa. 55. 6.
seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is
near. This is the charge of our Savior Christ to his Disciples, Mat. 2^. 41.
watch and pray. S. Paul's exhortation to the Romans, is, to Romans 12. 12.
continue instant in Prayer: to the Ephesians, to Ephe. 6. 18.
pray always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit; and to the
Thessalonians, to 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17.
pray without ceasing. S. James says, Iam. 5. 13.
Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. And S. Peter's exhortation, is, 1.
Pet. 4. 7.
be ye sober, and watch unto Prayer. Thus the Scripture exhorts us to Prayer.

Secondly, examples of holy, and devout men may 2 Examples.
persuade us to the practice of this duty of Prayer; Moses the man of God, is
Exodus 32. 11. 12. 13. 31. 32. And Exodus 14. 13. 14. 15. Numb. 21. 7.
often found praying for the people, when they had sinned against God. David's
psalms are full of prayers, praises, and thankesgiuings unto God: Daniel is
devout in Prayer, using to Dan. 6. 10.
pray three times a day. Cornelius has commendation, that he was Act. 10. 2.
a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much
alms to the people, and prayed to God always. The Apostles of Christ we find
Act. 1. 24. 25. And Act. 4 24. 25. etc. to 31. And Act. 6. 4. 6.
often praying: yea, and we may find our Savior Christ himself not only
teaching us to pray, but also giving us an example of prayer, in himself: when
he fed the five thousand with the five loaves and two fishes, he first Mat. 14.
19.
looked up to heaven, and blessed: and after that the people were filled, and
departed, Ver. 23.
he went up into mountain apart to pray. In his Luke 22. 41. 42. 44.
^agonie, he prayed earnestly, that the cup might be removed from him. And the
seventeenth Chapter of S. John's Gospel, is nothing else but a heavenly, and
devout prayer, which our Savior Christ makes to his Father, in the behalf of
himself, that his Father would Ioh. 1. 5.
glorify him; in the behalf of his Disciples, that the Father would Ver. 15.
keep them from the evil: and Ver. 17.
sanctify them through the truth: and in the behalf of them also Ver. 20. 21.
22. 23. 24.
which shall believe on Christ, through their word, that they all may be one,
and may be with the Lord where he is, and may behold his glory. These are
examples written for our instruction, to move us also to be careful of
performing this duty of Prayer; to call upon the name of the Lord, to pray
unto God, and to praise God.

Thirdly, there is a great necessity of praying: for 3 The necessity of
praying For


First, our want is very great; both in regard of temporal blessings, and
spiritual graces: for concerning our temporal state; when we were borne into
the world, we were naked, destitute of clothing, having neither 1 Our want is
very great.
food nor raiment. For 1. Tim. 6. 7.
we brought nothing into this world; as says the Apostle. And concerning our
spiritual state, we were Psalm. 51. 5.
shapen, framed, and borne in sin, and conceived in iniquity. And we were
Ephe. 2. 3.
by nature children of wrath. And therefore we have great need of bettering our
state, both in regard of our souls, and bodies. Now, S. James tells us that
Iam. 1. 17.
Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from
the Father of lights. All good blessings and benefits needful for us, come
from God, our heavenly Father, who is above: and the means to bring them down
unto us, is by Prayer: and ordinarily, without prayer we obtain nothing.
Wherefore S. James says, Iam. 4. 2.
ye have not, because ye ask not. And for this cause it is, that our Savior
Christ has taught us to pray to our Father which is in heaven, that he would
Mat. 6. 11. 12.
give us our daily bread, and forgive us our daily sins.

Secondly, Prayer is very necessary for us; for we live 2 We are in
continual fear of perils and dangers.
in continual fear of petills, and dangers, outward, and inward. When we rise
in the morning, we know not the dangers which may befall us before the evening:
night and day, we are subject to many perils and dangers; to sundry
afflictions, tribulations, and temptations: we have many enemies; the flesh
fighting against the spirit, and entising us to sin: the world alluring us to
vanity: and we have a most sore, and cruel 1. Pet. 5 8.
adversary the Devil, who as a roaring Lion walks about, seeking whom he
may devour. And for this cause, we had need to be 1. Pet. 47.
sober and watch unto Prayer. To Mat. 26. 41.
watch and pray, that we enter not into temptation. And to Ephe. 6. 18.
pray always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit.

Thirdly, such is the necessity of prayer, that except a 3 Except a man
exercise himself to Prayer, he is dead being alive.
man pray unto God, and call upon his name, he has no true life of grace in
him; but is as a dead man in Gods account, howsoever he be alive to the world.
S. Paul says 1. Tim. 5. 5. 6.
she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues
in supplications and prayers night and day, but she that lives in pleasure is
dead while she lives. In which words, the Apostle opposes a widow spending
her days in supplications and prayers, to a widow living in pleasure: And as
she that lives in pleasure, is dead while she lives; so on the other-side,
she that devoutly gives her self to supplications and prayers, is alive, and
she lives the best, and happiest life, the life of grace: to which, agrees
the saying of S. Chrysostom; Quisqui^ non orat Deum, nee diuino colloquio
cupit assi lue frui, is mori nu^ est, et vita car^ns. Chrysostom. de orando D^um l.
1.
whosoever does not pray unto God, and does not desire to have divine, and
heavenly communication with God, the same is as a dead man, without life. Such
a one has no true life, for he lives without God, and without Christ, who is
Joh. 14. 6.
the way, the truth, and the life.

Fourthly, the neglect of Prayer, is a note and badge 4 The want of prayer, is
a mark of wicked and ungodly men.
of wicked, and ungodly men; the Prophet David says, Psalm. 14. ^*
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge; who eat up my people as they
eat bread, and call not upon the Lord? Job describes the wicked, not only by
their prosperous state in this world, but also by their ^ilfull ignorance, by
their careless neglect of the service of God, and their contempt of Prayer.
For he says of them, Job 21. 14. 15.
they say unto God, depart from us: for we desire not the knowledge of thy
ways: what is the almighty that we should serve him? And what profit should
we have, if we pray unto him? Now then, if this be a mark of wicked, and
ungodly men, of profane people, that have little, or no fear of God before
their eyes, not to pray unto God; then certain, it is most necessary for all
that desire to fear God, and would be of the number of the righteous; to be
diligent and careful to serve God, to pray unto him, and to call upon his
name. Such is the necessity of Prayer.

Fourthly, the consideration of the good which wereceiue, 4 The benefit of
Prayer.
by making our prayers, and supplications unto God, should persuade us to pray
unto God, and to call upon his name. For

First, if we pray unto God, and call upon his name, the 1 God has promised to
hear our Prayers, and grant our requests.
Lord has promised to hear us, and grant our requests. Psalm. 50. 15.
call upon me, says the Lord, in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee. And
David says, Psalm. 65. 2.
O thou that hear prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. And our Savior
Christ says, Mat. 7. 7.
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find: knock, and it
shall be opened unto you. David prays, and was heard; Psalm. 18. 6.
In my distress says he, I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he
heard my voice out of his Temple, and my cry came before him, even into his
ears. Hezekiah prayed, and the Lord heard him; and sent him this word by the
Prophet, Isa. 38. 5.
Go and say to Hezekiah, thus says the Lord, the God of David thy Father; I
have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: Cornelius also has witness
from heaven that God heard his prayer; for an Angel is sent unto him, which
said, Acts. 10. 31.
Cornelius, thy prayer is heard: thus the Scripture does make it manifest, that
God hears our prayers. And this is an exceeding great benefit, that we make
our prayers to such a God, that is both able to hear us, and not like the Gods
of the heathen, which have ears and hear not; and is also willing to hear
us, for he bids v^ seek unto him, and call upon him. And albeit, Ioh. 9. 31.
God hears not sinners, (and wicked men) Yet if any man be a worshipper of
God, and does his will, him he hears. And 1 Ioh. 5. 14.
If we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us. Yea, and John. 16.
23.
Whatsoever we shall ask the father in his name, that is, in the name of
Christ, he will give it us. So that a righteous man praying aright, shall be
heard; for How God hears our prayers.
the Lord has promised to hear him, to help him, and to deliver him. But
this hearing of the righteous, is after a twofold manner.

First, oftimes, and for the most part, God so hears 1 He gives us sometime
the same things which we desire.
the prayers of the righteous, that he grants them their requests, and gives
them even the same things which they desire, and ask according to his will.

Secondly, sometime God hears the prayers of the righteous; and yet grants
them not the same things 2 He grants not the same things which we desire, but
some thing else better for us.
which they required, but in stead thereof, gives them something else, which
God in his wisdom knows to be more expedient, and better for them. Paul
being tempted, prayed against the temptation, and that earnestly, for he says,
2 Cor. 12. 8. 9.
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And
he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made
perfect in weakness. When Paul was troubled with that Verse. 7.
Thorn in the flesh, and had the messenger of Satan to buffet him, when he
was tempted, and prayed thrice, that is often, against the temptation, the Lord
did not altogether free him from the temptation, yet the Lord heard him, in
that he gave him his grace to resist the temptation, and strength to stand
against the assaults of the Devil. So Christ our Savior, when he was in his
agony, prayed and that earnestly, with Heb. 5. 7.
Strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and
was heard, in that he feared. The Apostle says, that Christ prayed, and was
heard, and yet we know that Christ suffered death, and the cup did not pass
from him, but he must needs drink of it: how

I Answer; First, Christ prays Luke 22. 42.
Not my will, but thine be done, and as one says, In hoc siquide^ quod
dicebat, Non quod ego volo, sed tua voluntas fiat, ex. auditus est. Cart. in
Mat. 26.
He was heard in this, that he said, not as I will but as thou will. Secondly,
when he was in his agony, and prayed earnestly to his Father, that the cup
migh be removed from him Luk 22. 43.
There appeared an Angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. So that
although he suffered death, yet he had strength and comfort from heaven, and so
he was heard. Thirdly, the manhood of Christ, in suffering, was supported, and
strengthened by the god head; and though he suffered death, yet he had
admirable strength from the divine nature, to endure the unspeakable wrath of
God, and to bear the heavy burden of our sins; and so he was heard. This
is the First benifite that we have by praying unto God, God hears our
prayers, and grants our requests.

The Second benefit, which we receive by prayer, is 2 Prayer is a great help
in trouble. Considered Two ways.
aid and succor, help, and deliverance in time of trouble: for prayer is the
best help, and the most present remedy in all trouble. this I manifest two
ways; proouing,

First, in general, that prayer is a help in all troubles: Secondly, that
prayer helps us in particular troubles which befall us in the course of our
life.
For the First: Prayer is the best, the surest, and readiest 1 Generally.
help in all trouble, Psalm. 50. 15.
Call upon me says the Lord, in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee. Iam.
5. 13.
Is any man among you afflicted? says S. James; let him pray. The Psalmist
says, Psalm. 46. 1.
God is our refuge and strength; a very present help in trouble. Solomon
says, Prou. 18. 10.
The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runs into it, and is
safe. And the servants of the Lord have found this true by experience, for when
they have been in trouble, they have run unto the Lord, and cried unto him
for help, and they have been helped and delivered, so David acknowledges,
saying, Psalm 18. 6.
In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my
voice out of his Temple, and my cry came before him, even unto his ears.
Again, he says, Psalm. 142. 4. 5.
I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know
me, refuge failed me: no man cared for my soul. Then he says, I cried unto
thee o Lord, I said, Thou art my refuge, and my portion in the land of the
living. Thus in general, the Scripture shows, that Prayer unto God, is a
ready, and present help in trouble; and that, when all other helps fail.

Secondly, in particular troubles and afflictions, Prayer 2 Particularly. as
is the best help: as

First, it is the best help in time of war, to deliver us from the danger of
the enemy, and to save us from the 1 In time of war.
peril of the sword: in such a case, it was Hezekias help against the King of
Assyria, for when Sennacherth King of Assyria, sent a blasphemous, railing
letter to Hezekiah King of Judah, Isa. 37. 14. 15. etc.
Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord.
And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord heard his prayer, and sent a
Prophet unto him to comfort him; and also sent an Angel to fight for Israel,
against the Assyrians, which Verse. 36.
smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundredth and fourscore and five
thousand. By this means was Hezekiah delivered from the hand of his enemies.
For as one says, Vere cael^stis est a^m^tura d^precatio, quae Deo ^^anditur.
Cloys. d^ crando Deum. l. 1.
supplication made unto God for deliverance, is indeed heavenly armor.

Secondly, Prayer is the best help in captivity, and servile bondage: in the
like case, it helped Manasseh, for 2 In captivity.
being carried captive to 2. Chr^. 33. 11. 12. 13.
Babylon, when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled
himself greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him, and he was
entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to
Jerusalem, into his kingdom.

Thirdly, prayer helps much in time of famine: this 3 In famine.
is the promise of the Lord to his people, saying, Isa. 41. 17.
When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue
fails for thirst, I the Lord will hear them. Giving us to understand, that
if in time of famine, and scarcity, the people shall pray unto the Lord, he
will hear them, and help them in their need.

Fourthly, in time of plague and pestilence, Prayer is a 4 In the plague, and
pestilence.
great preservative: for the Lord says, 2 Chro. 7. 13. 14.
If I send pestilence among my people: if my people which are called by my
Name, shall humble themselves and pray; and seek my face, and turn from their
wicked ways: then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and
will heal their land.

Fifthly, Prayer is the best help in temptation; 5 In temptation.
either to be freed from the temptation, or to obtain grace, and strength from
God, not to be overcome of the temptation, It was Paul's help when he had that
2. Cor. 12. 7.
thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet him; in which case, he
prayed to the Lord, and that with feruencie, and perseverance, for says he,
Ver. 8 9.
for this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And
he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made
perfect in weakness.

Sixthly, Prayer is a help in time of sickness; it delivers 6 In sickness.
from corporal infirmities. Wherefore Saint James says, Iam. 15. 4. 15.
Is any sick among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let
them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the
prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up. It
helped Hezekiah in his sickness, for Hezekiah being Isa. 38. 1. 2. etc.
sick unto death, prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord heard his prayer, and
lengthened his days, adding unto his days fifteen years.

Lastly, Prayer helps not only to ease, and heal the 7 Prayer is a remedy
to cu^e the sick soul.
sick body, but also to cure the sick soul. This was David's remedy, when
his soul was sick and diseased with sin, as his body was through
infirmity: saying, Psalm. 6. 1. 2. 3.
have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord heal me, for my bones are
vexed. My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? Return O Lord,
deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies sake. And again he prays,
saying, Psalm. 41. 4.
O Lord, be merciful unto me, heal my soul for I have sinned against thee.
And Chrysostom, agreeing with these Scriptures, says, that Prayer is a Animis
aegrotantibus pharmacum. Chrysostom. de orando Deum. lib. 1.
medicine to sick souls. This is the second benefit of prayer, it is a help
in trouble.

Thirdly, the Prayer of a righteous man, framed according to the right manner,
formerly mentioned, is a 3 Salvation promised to them that call upon the name
of the Lord.
means to procure not only temporal benefits, and spiritual graces, but
also salvation: for so is the promise, Romans 10. 13.
whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved. For as the
promise is made concerning them that believe in Christ, that Ioh. 3. 16.
whosoever believes in him shell not perish, but have everlasting life; and
concerning them that repent, that if they Act. 3. 19.
repent and be converted, their sins may be blotted out, and their souls
saved: so likewise concerning Prayer, the promise is, that Whosoever shall call
on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.

The consideration of this, that Prayer is so great a Against those who in time
of trouble, seek not unto the Lord, but either put their trust in lawful
means; or seek help by unlawful means.
afflictions; serves,

First, to reprove those, who in time of trouble, seek other help then from
God; and trust in means; yea, and use such means as God has not appointed:
and do not seek to the Lord, by prayer, and supplication. As some, in their
sickness, seek to the Physician, they call earnestly upon him, and pray him
to do his best for them; but do not so earnestly call upon God, and pray unto
him to be favorable unto them, to pardon their sin, and first to heal their
soul, that so their body may be healed. Such are like to King Asa, who 2.
Chro. 16. 12.
in his disease, sought not to the Lord, but to the Physicians. And this was
imputed unto Asa for sin, and it remains a blemish upon his name, to this
day: for although it be lawful to seek to the Physician, and to use his
help; yet, to trust in the help of the Physician, more then in the help of
God; and to seek first, and rather to the Physician, then unto God, is
sinful: for God is our best help, and our best Physician; without whose
help, the help of the Physician is nothing worth. Others there are, who being
sore sick, or any whit strangely diseased* or visited with a lingering disease;
seek not to God, as to the best and chiefest help, nor yet, to the Physician,
as to the lawful means; but seek, and send to witches, and wizards, to
forcerers, and charmers, like to King Ahaziah, who being 2. Kin. 1 2.
sick, sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the god
of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this disease. This was Ahaziah's sin;
and this is the sin of all those, who, in their distress, seek not to the
Lord, neither seek help by lawful means, but seek help by unlawful, and
deuillish means: contrary to the charge and commandment of the Lord, which
he gives unto his people, saying, Leuit. 19. 31.
Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after Wizards, to be
defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.

Secondly, seeing that we have so many motives to To give our selves denoutly
to Prayer.
of holy, and devout men; yea, and of Christ himself; seeing that the
necessity of Prayer is so great; that without Prayer, we can obtain no good
thing; seeing we are in continual peril and danger; seeing they that do not
pray unto God, are as dead men among the living; and seeing that the want of
Prayer is a mark of wicked and ungodly men. Furthermore, considering the great
good, and benefit which we have by Prayer; seeing that the Lord hears us, and
grants our lawful requests; seeing that prayer is the best help in trouble;
the best weapon against our enemies, the best ransom in captivity, the best
prouider in famine, the best remedy against the pestilence, the best Physic
in sickness, the best comfort in temptation, the best means to cure the body,
and heal the soul; and seeing that whosoever calls on the name of the Lord,
shall be saved; the consideration of these things, should be of great force to
move, and persuade us, to dedicate our selves to the serving of God, to give
our selves devoutly to prayer, to invocation, and calling upon the name of the
Lord; accounting it our health, our joy, and happiness, that we, so wretched,
and miserable creatures, should be admitted into the presence of so great a
King, as the King of Kings; that we should have access unto the throne of
grace; and should have communication with the Lord. For as a mean subject
would count himself a happy man, if he might find such favor with his
Sovereign Lord, the King, as that he might have free access into his
presence, and liberty to make any lawful request unto the King, with
assurance that the King would hear him, and grant his petition; so, a poor
Christian (whatsoever his estimation be in the world) concerning his spiritual
state, is a happy man, for he may have free access into the presence of the
King of heaven and earth; he may Heb. 4. 16.
come boldly to the throne of grace, may obtain mercy, and find grace to
help in time of need. This exhortation, to be devoutly given to call upon the
name of the Lord, and to be instant in prayer, and supplication unto God, is
very necessary to be practiced of all, high and low, rich and poor, one and
other; and very expedient it is for Ministers to call upon the people every
where, and to exhort them to be frequent, and fervent in prayer; especially in
these evil days, wherein, devotion, with many, is waxen cold; and with some,
is fallen asleep, and had need to be awaked. I have showed by the Scriptures,
that Moses, David, Daniel, Cornelius, with diverse others; that the Apostles of
Christ, yea, and Christ himself, have been all much given to prayer; and I
read of James Gal. 1. 19.
the Lords brother, that with praying much, and often, Ge^ua ipsius in morem
camel^, sensum co^tactus amiserint. Eusebius. l. 2 c. 23.
his knees were waxen so hard, by reason of kneeling much, that they were as
hard as camels knees, so that he had no feeling of any pain, when he prayed
kneeling upon his knees. That was a happy age, and those were blessed times;
for then men had hard knees, and soft hearts: but in these evil days, its
contrary; for many in these our days, have soft knees, and hard hearts. In
those better times, good men were, as Cornelius was, Act. 10. 2.
devout men, fearing God, giving much alms to the people, and praying to God
always. But in these days, many of us come far short of Cornelius his
devotion; for he gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always: I
fear, it may be truly said of many amongst us, that they give few alms to
the people, and pray to God seldom.

Wherefore, if any have hitherto been negligent, and slack in performing this
religious duty of Prayer, either publicly, or privately, let them pray, (and
the Lord grant they may pray) that the Lord would inflame their hearts with
zeal, and devotion; that he would Zach. 12. 10.
power upon them the spirit of grace, and of supplications; and that he would
send his holy Spirit into their hearts, to Romans 8. 26.
help their infirmities, To teach them to pray as they ought, and to Ver. 15.
cry Abba Father. And whosoever they are, that have already addicted
themselves to this holy, and heavenly duty of prayer, let them be encouraged
to persevere; and pray, that they may have grace to be constant, and to
continue therein.

And now I conclude, with the exhortation of Saint Paul, Coless. 4. 2.
Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving: joining
thereunto, the like exhortation of Saint Peter; 1. Pet. 4. 7.
the end of all things ^s at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto
Prayer. Now, the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation, confirm
and strengthen our faith, till the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; and grant,
that through his grace, we may be brought to true, and unfeigned Repentance; and
that by the guiding of his holy Spirit, we may walk in holy obedience to his
heavenly will, all the days of our life; that we may sincerely deuote our
selves to Prayer, and calling upon the name of the Lord; that so at our last
end, we may be received into the Celestial Paradisc; through the merits of
Jesus Christ our Lord and only Savior. Amen. ()
