John Hadlands advice: Or a warning for all young men that have means,
advising them to forsake lewd company Cards, Dice, and Queanes,
To the tune of the bonny bonny Broom.


TO all men now. I Will plainly show,
how I have spent my time,
For I have wrought my overthrow
with drinking Beer and Wine:
I had no grace for to foresee
my folly, 'till 'twas too late,
But still did follow lewd company,
I mean each drunken Mate.
But now I may with sorrow sadly say,
my heart is filled with woes,
Had it not been for the good Ale-tap,
I had gone in better clothes.
My means is spent and all is gone,
and friendship now is grown cold,
Alas, I Am comfortless alone,
now I think o'th proverb old,
Which says as long as men have means
they shall regarded be:
But having none they lose their friends,
and then comes misery.
For now I may, etc.
So long as I had money store,
I had much pleasure indeed,
But now alas I am grown poor,
and do want to serve my need:
But there is none will do for me,
as I for others have done,
For I was always kind and free,
and that is plainly known.
But now, etc.
I have been drinking oftentimes,
amongst the roaring brave Boys,
Of Beer and Ale, and choice of Wines,
which I have thought much joys.


But now I find it was not good
to use such company.
For now alas I have understood,
it has caused my misery.
And now. etc.
I had no power for to give over,
when once I did begin,
I (...)my money and run o'th store,
to allow that deadly sin:
Alas I did not think that I
should e're have suffered want,
For I did cry hanged let money ^lie,
it is vain to think upon it.
But now, etc.
Whilst I had means I still found friends
which made a very fair show,
But now I want, their friendship ends,
and me they will not know.
Which strikes terror to my poor heart
to think what I have been;
But now I suffer woe and smart
even for my former sin.
And now, etc.
My Host and Hostestes where I came,
they would bid me welcome still,
I was the man that had the fame,
to call and bid them ^ll:
If I bid go then they would run,
to tend on me they were willing:
And many a time it was well known,
for two groates I paid a shilling.
But now I may with sorrow sadly say,
my heart is filled with woes,
Had it, etc.
The second part, To the same tune.


THeir words were sweet and I might greet,
my Hosts and her fine Maid,
With a kiss or two when as none did see it,
but I have full dearly paid.
For they would crave fine knacks to have,
and I did give it them still.
My means maintained them fine and brave,
their minds I did fulfill.
But now I may with sorrow sadly say,
my heart is filled with woes:
Had it not bin for the good Ale-tap,
I had gone in better clothes.
Sometimes an ell of Lawne or two,
Cambrick or Holland most fine,
For a favor on a Less I did bestow,
to walk with me tot'h Wine,
And there I have consumed my means,
in a most shameful sort,
Amongst those Caterpiller queanes,
which grieves me to report.
But, etc.
You Gallants all, to you I cry and call,
learn by me for to be wise.
For I did climb till I had caught a fall;
and now I cannot rise:
Therefore I Am in a woeful estate,
as all men plainly may see:
Now I repent but it is too late,
for there is no remedy.
And, etc.


Now must I stand with my cap in my hand,
and of a clown favor crave,
Whereas formerly I have had command
of those were fine and brave:
But now brave Gallants me despise,
because that I have no means,
Once more young men learn to be wise,
hate Cards, Dice, Whores, and Queanes.
For, etc.
John Had-land now some do me call,
and that name well I may have:
I being poor they will chide and braule,
and do call me rogue and slave:
Which is much grief unto my mind,
to think they should use me so,
They Are harsh to me to whom I was kind,
my friend is grown my foe.
Therefore, etc.
Thus have I told to young and old,
that they may warning now take,
For hereby me you may well behold,
that friends will you forsake:
When once that you grow poor and bare,
and have no money to pay,
Then follows misery grief and care,
and your friends depart away.
Therefore I may with sorrow sadly say,
my heart is filled with woes:
Had it not bin for the good Ale-tap,
I had gone in better clothes.
