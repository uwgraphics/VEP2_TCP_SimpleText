ancient writers. Compiled by Gregory Scot. 1570

The Printer to the Christian Reader.
THough volumes great and learned works,
Of famous men hereof be ryfe:
VVherby both Papists, Jews and Turks
Have deadly wounds, for all their strife.
And though these sects have not such life,
In these our days, as late they had:
Yet (gentle Reader) take in brief,
This treatise gaynst these errors bad.
Which for the truth in plain discourse,
And pleasant verse, by sense well tryde,
Of such as are learned and wise:
I thought therefore not it to hyde.
But publish it, to daunt the pride,
Of them that still will hold the same,
Gaynst God and truth, and therein bide,
Regarding neither truth nor shame.
But chiefly for the simple sort,
This is set forth, in form most plain,
In pleasant wise, and order short,
That they may view with lesser pain,
And in their mind the same contain,
As for the learned though they know,
These errors all, and them refrain,
For others skyll does this allow.
The Author to me as unknown,
To thee good Reader I commend,
This work out set, and now forth blown,
Shall show forth that he did entende.
Which was (I hope) some folk to mende,
Who wander in these errors ill,
Thy favor then to him extend,
Accepting this as his good will.
And praise thou God for this his light,
Which in our days does now so shine,
Who opened has the minds and sight,
Of many learned, for profyt thine.
To God alone therefore resign,
These praises due, and not to men,
Yet in thy prayers have in mind,
Their good estate, and thank God then.
But chiefly pray thou for those states,
By whose good means this light we joy,
As namely Prince and Magistrates,
Which keeps us from all anoy.
The Pastors eke, for them do pray,
And frame thy life in virtues trace,
In humble wise them love and obey,
So shall thou quyt their laborous case.
FINIS.
A brief treatise against certain errors of the Romish Church.
HOw is the faithful City chaungde, Esaias. i. e

from that it was before?
Where righteousness sometime did sit,
now bloodshed raygneth more.
Rome once it had renowned praise, Roma. i. e.

for Truth therein did dwell:
A faithful City once it was,
and others did excel.
But now ungodliness does raygne, Mantua. in Roma. ex primo lib. Syluarum.

where faith did then abound:
Their wicked and most loathsome lives
throughout the world does sound.
Rome is a cage of Birds unclean, Apoc. 18. a

a sincke of filthy sin:
Few errors have the Church infect,
that did not there begin.
From thence they spread over the earth
what place could once be found, Apoc. 18. a, 14. b

That free was from infection?
in Europe none was found.
Where canker once has taken root,
it creeps over all,
Herein that wicked mother church
we may to witness call.
Which once declining from the truth,
and from the perfect way,
Has ever since mo errors bred,
and further gone astraye.
Of these errors my purpose is,
here briefly to entreat,
But not of all, for that were much,
the number is so great.
I mean of such as you your selves,
by whom mayntaynd they be,
Gala. iij. a Romans xj. b Deu. 29. a
Might sone perceive (so plain they are)
if eyes you had to see.
This serves for the ignorant,
whom you do most infecte,
The learned know your errors well,
and have them all detecte.
Deu. xix. b 2. Cor. 13. a John. 8. b
Three witnesses confirm a truth,
yet mo that wytnes bear,
Thereby you are more guilty found,
your errors more appear.
The errors be so catholic,
in your religion,
That order there is none at all,
but great confusion.
Which is the cause that orderlesse,
herein I do observe,
Although to some it be offense,
less blame it does deserve.
Therefore mine entry where to make,
my mind is much in doubt,
Such heaps of errors do I see,
your Romish church throughout.
Against Images and Idolatry.
But worshipping of images,
a gross and grievous sin,
Because it is a custom old,
with it I will begin.
In things against the law of God
if that you do offend,
Then plead you custom commonly,
your errors to defend.
But yet such custom here you have,
you may put in your plee.
Why should it not take place? it is
of such antiquity.
Eusebius. ecclesi hist. lib. 7. ca. 14 Hieron. in Iere. ca. 10
Welnigh for age it rotten is,
your Idols show the same,
The old heathen they used it long,
from thence this custom came.
But chiefly how they first began,
Genes. 31. c
and since have taken root,
(Although yet some were long before)
this briefly shall you note.
Wisd. 14. b
The Father mourning for the death
of his beloved Son,
An image to remember him
he wild to make anon.
In time, this custom so preuaild,
incrreasing more and more,
That rytes and offerings were deuisde
the Image to adore.
And tyrants did by cruel law,
compel men so to do,
The beutye of the cunning work,
did much intise thereto.
Though Father only for his Son,
this image did devise,
Of small begynninges yet we see
great mischiefs may arise.
But though Idolatry, among
the Heathen thus did reign:
Yet of long time in Christ his church,
no place it did obtain.
Until next after Christ his death,
four hundredth years were past,
No Image then was worshipped,
nor yet in churches plaste.
But when the Apostles of the Lord, Eusebius. ecclesi. hist. lib. 3. ca. 31

and their Disciples true
Were taken hence, and few were left
their preachinges to renew:
The Church began then to decline,
true knowledge did decay,
Then Images crept in withal,
and lead them more astray.
But as I said, these Idols came
from Gentiles, that did use
The Images of worthy men, Wisd. 14. b

such as them selves did choose.
Of whom some memory to keep,
(by error so deceived)
They honored their Images,
for benefits received.
These Heathen convert unto Christ,
Euse. lib. 7. cap. 14.
like error keeping still,
They caused Images to make,
in sign of their good will,
Of Christ, of Paul, and other mo,
and kept them reuerentlye,
Thus first amongst the Christians,
began Idolatrye.
Nothing in scripture is forbid,
so much as Images,
Exodus 33. e.
Yet to no sin more prone we be,
then to such wickedness.
But most ungodly is this work,
whereby you would express,
The living God in outward form,
of graven Images.
Moses giving charge hereof,
this evil did forsee,
Deuteronomy. iiij. c
Thou heardst the voice of God, he says
no Image did thou see.
Take heed therefore unto thy soul,
always remember this,
No Image make unto thy self, Deuteronomy. 7. d.

a damned thing it is.
The godhead is not like to gold,
nor like to silver bright, Act. xvij. ^

It is not like to wood or stone.
nor subject to the sight. Exodus 33. d

Who has seen God at any time? John. i. b.

the workman did but guess,
When like an old man he him made,
of bigness more or less.
Belyke his years they now decay, Job. 10. ^

who can be always young?
His old gray bearde does seem to show
he cannot sure live long.
The glory of the immortal God, Roma. 1. c.

whose shape was never seen,
To Images of mortal men, Exodus 33. d

thus have you changed clean.
But whereof be their Images? Esai. 46. b Dani. 14. a Act. xvij. f. Wisd. xv.c.

of God they can be none,
For he does live even of him self,
and gives life alone.
Abac. 2. d Wisd. 13. d
The Image has no life nor breath,
nor cannot move at all,
Barn. 6. c
It cannot once get up again,
if that it chance to fall.
2. Par. 2. b
Moreover God is infinite,
and measurde cannot be,
His breadth, his length, how can you show
in metal, stone, or tree?
Job. 11. b
No carnal substance is in God,
such thought have not in mind,
John. 4. c
God is a spirit, and who can
an Image thereof find?
Athana. contra. Gentiu^. Esa. xlvi. b
No liknes then there is of God,
in image wrought by art,
In substance, nor in outward form,
nor any other part.
Wis. xiiii. a
Therefore accursed is the work,
reprochefull unto God,
Acts. 17. f
Whereby the Godhead you compare
unto a piece of wood.
Yet here my meaning is not such
percisely to refuse,
All Images of creatures,
or none at all to use.
For caruing and eke painting are
good gifts we not deny,
In similitudes of creatures,
to use them lawfullye.
As Birds, or beasts and of such like
as here our eyes do see,
Pictures of men some use they have,
if story written be.
Except some pleasure to the sight,
else profit bring they none,
If that the storye be not showed,
but Images alone.
Of Jesus Christ though man he were,
great danger is therein,
To carue or paynt similitude,
so prove we are to sin.
For humayne body to such end,
our savior did not take,
That Caruers should lisentiously,
such Image thereof make.
But having wrought salvation,
the same he took away
Into the heaven, out of our sight, Acts i. b.

until the judgment day.
John. 16. c
His own Disciples did depend
so carnallye upon
Christ's body when it present was,
Luke 24. g
He did depart anon.
John. 16. a
It was not then expedient,
his body here to be,
What help to faith with carnal eyes
Ioh. 20. g.
his image now to see?
Esai. 46. b Deuteronomy. 4. c.
Image at all unto our God
we are forbid to frame,
To Christ who is both God and man
how may we do the same?
Yet be they not his images,
for monstrous then he were,
For of a thousand, not one like
another, does appear.
What great offense, and what abuse,
through Images have been,
Experience does teach to well,
our eyes they have it seen.
The Paynters did to much reproach
unto the Saints of God,
To paynte them so lassiuiouslye,
upon a stock of wood.
Or if they were plain on the wall,
all did with gold so glitter,
They looked like wanton Paramours, Barn. 6. a

I could judge them no better.
The blessed Virgin in her life,
both Peter, and the rest,
Had they such precious garments then
wherewith they now be dressed?
These pearls and rings they used not,
they lived soberlye,
But Papists think no shame hereof
to uphold Idolatrye. Iere. iij. a.

Full well they know these things intise
when all does shine so bright, Wisd. xv. a

The foolish people think it is,
a comlye pleasant sight.
For this they seek for cunning men,
the Image to set forth,
The offerings else, for which they gape,
they would be nothing worth.
Thus of good creatures, Wisd. 14. b
they are
made snares to catch men in,
Intrapted have they many one,
since first they did begin.
Epiphanius in an Epistle to John bishop of Jerusalem.
Therefore an Image may not stand,
in temples where we pray,
Of true religion they have been,
always the great decay.
Lactant. lib. 2. de origin erroris. c. 19 Aug. lib. lib. de. 4. de ciuitate
dei.
Yea no religion can there be
where Images be plast,
The fear of God they take away,
and bring contempt at last.
Yea of the Heathen some there were,
that could not them abide,
But as vayn works of Crafts men,
they did them often deryde,
Augu. in lib. de vera religione. Barn. 6. ^
Socrates, he did more esteem
a Dog by nature wrought
Then Image made, which he despisde
even as a thing of naught.
A Dog rather would he worship
then Image wanting breath,
Wherefore at length the people, did
put him to cruel death.
Ambr. in lib. 2. de virginibus.
When Dionisius went into
the temple of his God
Jupiter, where ritchly decked
his gorgeous Image stood.
The Idol he despised so,
he did command anon,
His golden garment to take of,
and gave a woollen one.
Saying, that gold in summer time
to heavy was to bear,
And in the winter season so,
to cold it was to wear.
He took also from Images
great dishes wrought of gold,
Which fastened were wtin their hands,
their offeringes for to hold,
And said, he took nothing but that
the Gods did freely give,
So mocking them, of all their gold,
he did them thus bereue. Barn. 6. a

Though some in churches would them have
no honor being done, Augus. in episto. ad Deogratias. 14.

Yet where it stands so in sight,
the Image tempts soon.
As painted Harlots they allure, Wisd. xv. a

their pleasant looks entise,
If that they stand there any while,
more evil will arise.
Herein few can them selves refrain,
so corrupt we be all,
Exodus 32. c
Without intising prone we are,
into such vice to fall.
S. Hiero^, Epiphanius. etc.
Therefore the Fathers would not have,
an Image any where,
In churches where the service was,
nor Picture painted there.
Full well they did the evil foresee,
that shortly after came,
Idolatry would take her leave,
if we would do the same.

Erasmus in his anno tacions upon the, i, Cor, 8


But for excuse this is alledgde,
that Images alone,
They have set up within their church,
but Idols they have none.
But though an Idol, and Image,
do differ in outward sound,
Yet all one thing to signify,
in Scripture they are found.
The one a Greek word well is known
the other Latin is,
Great difference who else do make,
therein they judge amiss.
Then may we call them Idols plain,
term you them what you will,
Such as long time the Heathen used,
and such as you use still.
What Idol worship has been done,
by Infidels before,
But to your Idols you your selves,
have done as much, or more?
Temples they builded for their use, Acts. xix. e

and chapels in likewise,
They made them shrynes and alters there
for daily Sacrifice. Act. xvij. e

They bowde their knees and fell down flat, Apocal. ix. d Baruc. 6. a Dani.
iiij. a 3, King, 11, b

they kissed them reverently,
Their goods they offered, and withal,
incense abundantly.
They prayde devoutly unto them, Wisd. xiii. d xiiij. a

for all kind of disease,
With flowers and garlands they were trymd
the better them to please.
They had also to honor them,
their candels burning bright,
Which far would have delyted them,
if they had had their sight. Baru, vi, b

But this discomfort Idols have,
and greater they have none.
Baru. 6. b Apoc. 9. d,
They be al blind, and see as much,
at midnight as at one.
Roma. ij. a
These heathnish works compard with yours,
where do they disagree?
Your selves how ca^ you then discharge
of like Idolatrye.
In the definition of the second Nicene council.
Again, their Idols to adore,
some of them do deny,
They worship God, or else the Saints,
whom they do signify.
But God will not be worshipped
by Image made with hand,
John. 4. a
In spirit and truth do worship him,
for so he does command.
Augu. in lib. de vera religione. cap, 55. Baruc. 2. d Esai. xlij. b
Nor workship to the Saints of God,
in no wise may be done,
All glory, worship, and honor,
is due to God alone.
They are they say, but stocks and stones,
we know as well as you,
Think not then that we are so mad
to them our knees to bow.
For that you know them so to be,
and yet offend herein,
This knowledge does augment your fault. Luke. 12. l.

the greater is your syn.
The Heathen so know welinough
their Idols what they were, Acts. 19. f

Even Images of fained gods
which they did worship there. As of Jupiter, Apollo, Mercury. etc

They were not yet so fond to think,
that stones or wood so wrought,
Could be the gods whom they did seek,
this was not in their thought.
The Israelites that made the Calfe, Exodus 32. a

they wist it was of gold,
For of their earinges it was formde,
their eyes might this behold.
They did not take that Calfe for God,
which did them so deliver,
But as a sign, Exodus 32. e
their god in deed
the better to remember.
Yet were they all Idolaters, 1. Cor. 10. a

you can it not denay,
Though vain excuses here be made, Augu. in Psalm. 113.

you be as ill as they.
For though you say you mean it not
to th Image that is there.
Yet what your meaning is in deed,
by this it may appear.
For where no Idol present is,
there present few will be,
To offer, or to knock, or kneel,
there candell none we see.
Therefore since Idols were remoude,
all pilgrimage is gone,
Crouches, ships, nor men of ware,
the people offers none.
Those Idols have these evils wrought
and caused to offend,
Destroy them all, and such abuse,
will soon be at an end.
But sundry means the Devil has taught
these Idols to uphold:
Gregorius the second.
They serve (they say) for Lay men's books
when they do them behold.
John. v, f 2. Tim, 3, d, Roma, j, c Psalm, xix,
But knowledge of God and of Christ,
the Scripture does us teach,
His power and wisdom infinite,
all creatures do preach.
These are good books to learn upon,
these God appointed has,
But Images accursed are, Deuteronomy. 17. c Wisd. 14. a

and do provoke his wrath.
If any would be ignorant,
of God his holy will,
These books will stand them in good stead,
so to continue still.
How Christ for us was crucified,
the scripture does it show,
The Sacraments in memory,
the same does often renew.
These are true witnesses of Christ,
his death they set forth plain, Galat. 3, a

These be good means to think on him
until he come again.
Error and vanity is taught, Iere. 10. a Abacu. ij, v

by Images of wood,
They be all dumme and cannot speak,
nor teach ought that is good. Baru, 6, a

But when the Pastors waxed dumme, Esaias. 56, d

and true light did declyne,
Their office to those Images,
the Pastors did resign.
For if that preaching had been used,
and people truly taught,
Those lying and dead Images,
they needed not have saught,
For Jesus Christ cannot be known,
by sight of eye so clear,
Romans x. d
But faith and truth obtained is,
by hearing of the ear.
Augu. in Psalm. 113.
When th Image stately stands a lost
more power it has to crook
The wretched soul, the^ truth to teach
to serve for any book.
Athanasius co^tra Gentiles.
Therefore unworthy is the work,
ungodly is the intent,
To know the living God thereby,
an Image to invent.
For if a mortal living man,
whom God him self has made,
To know God or remember him,
cannot at all persuade:
Then dead men carved out of wood,
how can they move thereto?
Abacu. ij. d Apoca. 9. d
That have no speech, no sight nor life
to stir them to or fro?
No knowledge then can come thereby
nor any good at all, Baru. vj. e wisd. xiij. d 14. b

They are most dangerous stomblyng blocks
occasion of great fall.
Wherefore for warning briefly take,
and keep it well in mind,
The fearful curse that God does give
in Scripture as we find. Deuteronomy. 17. d

Accurssed be the man that shall
a molten Image frame, wisd. 14. ^

In any metal, or by art
of caruing, do the same,
And shall it place, so being wrought,
in secret corner then,
All people with one free consent,
shall thereto say, Amen.
Against the sacrifice of the Mass and the wicked adoration.
GOD has his love unto mankind
Rom, ^, b, John. iij. b. 1. Ioh. 4. b
declarde in sundry wise,
But most when Christ his Son he gave
for sin a sacrifice.
Such was the greuousnes of sin,
such wrath it did deserve,
No sacrifice that ever was
Psa, xiviij
could man from death preserve.
Until Christ Jesus offered up
Heb. ix, c, d
his body on the tree,
An everlasting Sacrifice
Heb, x, b, c
for all our sin to be.
Apo. xiij. b
Christ is the only Lamb of God,
whose blood was shed for sin,
And in full force remained, since
the world did first begin,
Hebre, x, a Hebre, ix, f. Heb, vij, d
The sacrifices that have been,
and offringes long before,
They were but figures of this one
enduring evermore.
This sacrifice was offered once, Hebre. ix. ^ Hebr. vij. d

Christ was the Priest alone,
To offer up him self for us,
mo Priests he needs none.
How dare you then so wickedly
this office to you take, Hebre. v. a

To offer up the Son of God
new sacrifice to make?
Though malice let you to confess, wisdo. ij. d

your error yet is plain,
No Priest on earth ought to presume, Hebr. ix. g

to offer him again.
Both bread and wine for Sacraments
we offer thankfullye, Theodoretus in Psalm. 110. Heb, xiii. c Phi, iiii, d Psa,
xlix, d Rom, xij, a Ephesians, iiii, e Malac, l, d Apo, viii, a Psa, exli, a

We offer alms for the poor,
with praise to God on hye.
An offering of our selves we make,
renude in heart and mind,
Our prayers so presented be,
such offringes do we find.
To offer these the Priests them selves
God does not only choose,
For Priests we all appointed are, i, Pet, ii, b Apocal, i, b

such sacrifice to use.
Hebr. ix. b Esai. liij. b John. x. c
But Christ was never offered,
nor yet shall be again,
But once, when he did yield him self
to death for to be slain
Therefore herein your wicked will,
your purpose does bewray,
You would again him crucifye,
if in your power it lay.
Or else why then do you attempt,
to offer so in vain
Hebr. ix. g
Christ's body? which yet cannot be,
except he dye again.
You say your sacrifice does purge
both sins of quick and dead,
Hebr. ix. e
But no forgeuenes can there be,
except some blood be shed.
Heb. ix. b
By blood into the holy place,
the hye Priest entered in,
By blood our Savior purchased
remission of our syn.
And if your Mass such merit have
for living and for dead,
Undoubtedly Christ's sacrifice
does stand in little sted.
What have we got by Christ his death
but Mass can it obtain?
From syn, from hell, it can discharge,
and from etternall pain.
Such holiness is hid therein,
that only hearing Mass,
No danger can us then assail,
all things come well to pass.
Such Mass we may blasphemous call
if blasphemy there be,
Yea full of wicked sacrilege,
full of Idolatry.
Of all abomination,
it is the wicked head,
Your god on earth, you need not look
for other in your need.
The sacrifice of Christ you make
no better in effect,
Then Ox, or Calfe, or then the Gaote, Hebr, ix. v. x, b

whose blood are now reject.
For those before were offered,
but could not sin remyt, Hebr. 10. ^

Remembrance only they did bring
of sins we did commyt.
As feeble make you Christ his blood
from sin us to redeem,
Else would you not so virtuous
your wicked Mass esteem.
Hebr, x, c ix. d
But Christ has found redemption,
that perfect is in deed,
For evermore sufficient,
none other do we need.
And being yet upon the cross,
our ransom to fulfill,
And yelding up the Ghost, such were
the words of his last will:
Man's health and his salvation,
John. ix. c Hebr. 10. c
it is now consummate,
And perfectly is finished,
your Mass it comes to late.
Hebre. i, c Iohnl, x. c i, Pet, ii,
Why do we then his words mistrust,
a Strangers voice to hear?
And leave our Christ, who all our syns
Esaias. liij. b
did in his body bear?
The small virtue of your patcht Mass
you might perceive by this,
The often repeating of the same
does prove how weak it is.
For if it were of such a force,
as could remove our sin,
Once being said, Hebre, x, ^
you needed not
again it to begin.
This was the cause that sacrifice
was often done before, Hebre, x, a Hebr, ix, b Hebr, vii, ^

Because they could no man again
to righteousness restore.
Besides a number here vntoutcht,
this error is therein, About the year of our Lord. 1226

Your carnal adoration,
which late you have brought in.
Whereby you do with danger great
the Sacraments adore,
The creature for Creator, Roma. i. ^

what error can be more?
What worship due is unto God,
what unto Christ the Lord,
Is not by man's will measured, Romans xv. ^ ii, Pet, i, d

but by Gods holy word.
Such strange worship as you do teach
was never known before,
In bread and wine here upon earth,
Christ Jesus to adore.
Mat. 26, c Mar, 14, c Luk xxij, b i, Cor, xi, f
Take, eat, and drink, and do ye this
in memory of me,
And this deuyde amongst you all
thus often we charged be.
But mention find we none at all,
of honor to it due,
This doctrine had not been forgot,
if that it had been true.
i, Cor, xi, f
The Apostle did deliver all
received of the Lord,
Yet of this adoration,
he speaks not a word.
Your idle brains has set aworke,
the people so to do,
You have a spirit reueald you this,
with many other mo.
John. 16. b Galat. j. d,
But not the spirit of God, for that,
does always well agree,
With gods pure word that written is,
your errors it does fly.
Our savior departing hence,
has left a pledge behind,
Of his great love and benefits,
which he wrought for mankind.
Even Sacraments of bread and wine
the which our eyes do see,
The virtue of his body and blood,
to teach us sensiblye.
By bread our body strengthened is, Augus. in episto. 22. ad Bonifacium. John.
vi. f

and noorished to live,
Christ's body so unto the soul,
the only life does give.
As wine the heart it does rejoice,
and cherefulnes does bring,
His blood so comfort the soul, John. vi. f

above all earthly thing.
Therefore the bread and wine do bear
(we need not think it strange)
The names of things they signifye, Gelasius co^tra Eutichen.

yet substance does not change.
The outward visible Sacraments,
the mouth does taste alone, Augu. in Psalm. 98.

But spiritual food is given thereby,
which faith must feed upon.
Of Christ to be partakers here,
it is no let at all, August. tract. in Johan. 50.

Though in his body he remain,
in place celestial.
The sun in substance is above,
yet feel we here below
The heat and power thereof to work,
on all things that do grow.
Augu. ad Dardanu^ ^. epist. 67
So though Christ's body be in heaven,
yet here if is by grace,
Through working of Gods holy spirit,
as if it were in place.
Phil, iii, d
No carnal presence then believe,
lift up thine heart on hye,
There woorship Christ on Gods right hand

These creatures he willed us,
with thankfulness to take,
Luke. 22. b
In memory of that his death,
he suffered for our sake.
With Christ his Institution
wherein does Mass agree?
What he comaundeth, that you break
and do clean contrary.
Luke xxij. b
Christ in remembrance of his death,
these Sacraments has made,
But for the sins of quick and dead,
your Mass is daily said.
Christ's Supper, both the Sacraments
of bread and wine does give,
But of the cup, your wicked Mass
the faithful does bereue.
Where we these sacraments should take,
as of his only gift,
You offer them to God for sin.
as ransom in his sight.
That he was once an offering made,
Christ's Supper teaches plain,
But Mass does daily offer him,
for Sacrifice again.
Christ's Supper common ought to be,
for all to feed thereon, Ieronimus in episto. ad Cor. 11.

But Mass is private to the Priest,
to eat and drink alone.
And when he has devoured all,
(to show his wickedness
In mocking them) with empty cup
he does the people bless.
You use the words like to a charm,
as if with your intent,
They had ye power substance to change
where Christ it never meant.
What strange iesture use you therein,
with turning to and fro?
You bless and cross on every side,
you beck and bow thereto.
You mock, you mow, you breath and blow,
with coniuring among,
No meruel though wonders be wrought
your breath it is so strong.
You stand some time as in a trance,
your fingers in your ear,
Psalm. lviij.
Which sign does show you have no mind
the truth at al to hear.
You speak the words all to your self
and that most secretly,
Least other should your cunning learn,
to make your god thereby.
You lift the Sacraments aloft,
above your shaven crown,
Then when the Idol is erect,
the people falls down.
You hang him in a rope of hemp,
A sign of small good will,
If any danger make you fly,
your god there hangs still.
And so does stand in great distress,
him self he cannot save,
As Labans gods were stolen from him, Gene. 31. c

such help your God may have.
You keep him till he mould again,
where be you taught these things?
Then do ye him for sin apply,
to such as money bringes.
He was by Judas sold but once, Mat. 26, b

when he did him betraye,
Judas herein you do excel,
you sell him every day.
Your mass does darke^ Christ his death
and drives it out of mind,
If in the same as you do teach,
forgiveness we may find.
Christ's testament of giving life, Hebre. 8. d 9. d

and pardon of our sin,
By death it was confirmed once,
nothing to change therein.
His testament you have defaste, Hebr. 10. e

his death you do deny,
For every Mass does it not grant,
new righteousness thereby.
And new forgeuenes of our sin,
even for the work once wrought,
What else do these new testamentes,
but set the first at naught?
But if you will have them to stand,
and ratifyed to be,
Hebr, ix. d
To make them perfect Christ must com
yet once again to dye.
This was ye cause that numbers great
your Mass so did embrace,
As bringing all salvation,
alone in every place.
So beutifull it did appear,
and shined all so bright,
The simple man (bewitch) did think,
it was a heavenly sight.
But who so thoroughly does it know,
and looks well thereon,
A damned thing most detestable,
will it confess anon.
These few may serve but for a taste,
what of the rest to hold,
For of the errors of the Mass,
the third here is not told.
Against the praying to Saints.
WHat profit of true prayer is, 1, King, 1,^ Psalm. 51. d Baruc, 3, ^

no tongue can well express,
What comfort to the heavy soul,
oppressed with carfulness.
Thereby our God he present is, Psalm. 50, ^ Psa. 145. d Mat, 26, d

when danger is at hand,
Defending and eke strengthening us,
temptacion to withstand.
His heavenly grace he grants soon, Esaias. 65. d Mar. 11. c Heb. iiij, d
Math. 7. b

if prayer do complain,
Thereby forgeuenes of our sin,
and peace we do obtain.
As walls the town does compass safe, Chrisost. de precatione.

when enmyes force is bent:
So prayer does the soul preserve,
when Satan does us tempt.
But of all these great benefits,
the faithful you bereue,
That in the Saints of God do teach,
the people to believe.
All contrary to Christian faith,
so leading them away,
Ieres. 17. e Esai. 49. b
From God the geuer of good gifts,
our only hope and stay.
And so a wicked faith reposde,
then prayer did succeed,
Whereby their names were called upon
for help in time of need.
By this we know your church to be
all false and counterfeat,
Apoc. 17. a ij. d
Even that same whore in skarlet red
where Satan has his seat.
Dani. 9. c Esaias. 43. a
For where ye church of Christ remains
there God alone is known,
His only name who calls upon,
Baru. 2, d
those people be his own.
But with your Romish church it is
Iere, 11, c
worsse, then with Judah was,
Because the number of your gods
does all your Cities pas.
For no disease nor danger is,
but there was ever one,
To whom you did ascribe the power
of curing it alone.
Saint Mary and saint Margaret
for women great with child,
Saint Barbara from fearful stroke
of thunder, did us shilde.
Saint Loy was leach for all your horse,
saint Patricke for your Ox,
Saint Job he had the only gift
for healing of the pox.
Saint John, and so saint Benedict
all poison could expel,
Sebastian, and saint Roche for plage
all others did excel.
Saint Blase for swelling of the neck,
Otilia for the sight,
Saint Steven also was prayde unto,
to save us in the night.
Saint Clement and saint Christofer
from drowning could preserve,
For pain of teeth the only praise
Appoline did deserve.
For headache Anastacius,
Vrbane was God of wine,
For sudden death s. Mark was sought
saint Antony for our swyne.
For ague was Saint Petronell,
Cornelis had the skill,
Of falling sickness dangerous,
to save us from the ill.
Saint Valentine for the kings evil,
saint Laurence for the fire,
All prisoners saint Leonard prayed,
to grant them their desire.
The Hunters had Eustachius,
the whores had Magdalene,
Unto saint George in time of war.
what seeking has there been?
These be your gods and many mo,
on whom the people call,
Ierem. ii. c
These be your stinking cesterns, that
no water hold at all.
Esa. viij. d
When you thus ran like Infidels,
to seek help at the dead,
4. Kin. 1, a
You thought no doubt in Israel
there was no God to dread,
Esaias. 50. b 59, a
You thought his power was very weak
and yet do think the same,
Esa, xliiii,
Else would you not put confidence,
in any other name.
But Papists and the Heathen both,
in this faith do agree,
If many gods they have to help,
the safer shall they be.
This fond opinion was the cause, Augu. de consensu euangeli staru^, lib. 1.
cap. 18

the Romans would not choose
The God of Israel, nor consent
his service for to use.
For then they knew that for their God
him only they should take, Exodus xx. ^ Deuteronomy. vi. a

But grant they would not, for one God
all other to forsake.
The first commandment does charge
in one God to believe,
To praise him, and to pray to him,
all woorship so to give.
These are chief points in serving God,
these things if we apply,
Or give to any Saint at all,
our God we do deny.
Therefore this one thing must you do,
if prayer you will make,
To Saints departed, and your selves,
to their defense betake:
First find ye means to make them gods
then all this strife shall end,
Such prayer and such service done,
they may you well defend.
Gregory the ix. canonized, saint Dominick and saint Fraunces An. 1240.
Your Pope he can canonize Saints,
your selves do teach it plain,
Perhaps he has even as great power
to make them gods again.
Until you bring this thing to pass,
in vain you call upon
Esaias. 63. d
The names of Saints, for they know not
the things that here be done.
wisdo. 1. b 1. Kin. 16. b 3. Kyn, 8, f Apoca. ij. f
They know not yet the thoughts of me^,
nor power have they none.
To search ma^s heart, how can they then
grant help to any one?
This is not to despise the Saints,
Apoc. 14, b Esai. 42. b Aug. lib. de ciuitate dei. c. 10 Aug. lib. de vera
religi. ca. 55. Act. 14. c
as you make some believe,
But this unto God is his due,
honor and praise to give.
But you do them most iniurye,
for they yet never did
Seek that belonged unto God,
nor to be worshipped.
Therefore those blessed Saints each one
in whom you now do trust,
When Christ shall come to judge us al
will then accuse you furst. John. v. ^

And where you make them Advocates
to God in time of need,
That through their intercession,
we may the better speed:
Such intercessors for mankind, 1. Ioh. 2. a Roma. 8. g

God has appointed none,
As means to bring us unto him,
but Jesus Christ alone. i, Tim, 2, b

He is the way, he is the door, Ioh, 14, a

by whom we enter all,
The door it serves for true men, Ioh, x, a, b

but thieves do clyme the wall.
As thieves we may you then account, John, x, b

such false ways to invent,
If you meant wall, with Christ alone,
then would you be content.
He is the Mediator of
all intercession, Aug. lib. co^tra Parmeniano^, 2. cap. 8. i Ioh, 2, a

And not only (as you do teach)
of our redemption,
Of praise which is perpetual,
you thus do him bereue,
And that which was but temporal
you are content to give.
Hebre, x, c
For once he wrought redemption,
but reigning now on hye,
Roma. 8. g 1. Ioh. ij. a
He there remains an Advocate
for us continuallye.
The Apostle having prayer taught,
he shows orderly,
One Mediator Jesus Christ
of God and Man to be.
And least that error should remain
or any doubt at all,
John. ij. a
Saint John also, Jesus alone
our Advocate does call.
Roma. 8. g
On Gods right hand he that does sit,
does intercession make,
Angel or Saint, how can you then
for Intercessors take?
Exodus, 32, f Ephe. vi. c Philip, j, a Gene, 18, c
Yet prayers which the faithful make,
as long as they do live,
One for another in distress
for godly we believe.
But those are wicked which you give,
and offer to the dead,
Or when you seek mo Advocates,
then Christ in time of need.
Our only Priest is in the heaven, Augu. in Psalm. 94.

and there does pray for thee,
Who here on earth, even for thy sake
contented was to dye.
The power and virtue of his death
which did us all redeem,
This intercession whole does work, Hebr, xii. ^

so God does it esteem.
Then Christ appears so for us,
before the heavenly throne,
That even the merit of his blood, ii, Cor, i, d

can speak for us alone.
All promises that God has made, John. vi, ^ xiiij. b

in Christ he does fulfill,
What thing we ask in Christ's name
he grants with good will. Chriso in homi. de pro^ectu euangelij tom. 6.
Ambr. in episto. ad Roma.

None other patron need we seek,
nor long discourse to make,
But if by Christ we come to him,
he can us not forsake.
In him if prayer do not end,
and so with him begin,
Augu. in Psalm. 108.
Such prayer does nothing avail,
but turned is to sin.
Ambr. de Isaac et anima.
He is our mouth, by whom always
to God we may be bold
To speak, he is our eye also,
whereby we him behold.
So our right hand he is, wherewith
we do our selves present,
Ioh xiiij, a
The way to life they do forsake,
that other means invent.
Apoc. iij. b
The key of David he it has,
that can both open and shut,
Mat, 28, d Mat, 11, d
All power is his, therefore for help
to him we ought to suite.
Psalm. 50. c
Call upon God in thy distress,
seek his power ever more,
Psa. 105. a Psalm, 36.
He will defend thee, and thou shall
yield him the praise therefore.
Psalm. 18. b
His name it is a tower most strong,
to all in time of need,
Joel. ij. g Roma. x. c
Who so his name does call upon,
has promise for to speed.
The man is cursed that flesh does take, Ier. xvv. a

to be his arm and strength,
And in his heart from God the Lord
departs at the length. Psa. 127. e

Against the justification of works.
FRom Adam even as from the root, Roma, v, c viij. b 4. Esd. 3, c

sin has spread over all
The branches that be of his stock,
through that his grievous fall.
Such is the poison that from him
all mankind has received,
That since we all be borne in sin, Psalm. 51. d

and so in sin conceived.
Therewith came all our myserye,
therewith did enter in
Death, both of body and of soul, Roma, v, c Romans vj. d

the just reward of sin.
Then entered hate, and ignorance
of God, and all distrust
Of heavenly grace and righteousness,
thus Man was spoiled furst.
Ephesians. ij. a Gene, j, d 4. Es. 7. d Eccl. 17. a
And so became the child of wrath,
once loved entirelye.
O Adam if thou had remaynde
in that feelicitie,
Wysd, 1, d
Then honger, cold, nor yet disease,
had never man assailde,
Roma. v. b
Then Satan's power, syn, death, nor hell
had never so preuailde.
Roma. v. b
But fithe the Devil such wickedness
into the world has brought,
Ephe, ij, c
And so betwixt God and mankind,
such enmity has wrought:
Of our religion greatest point,
truly to learn is this,
How man to perfect righteousness
again restored is.
ii. Cor. v. d Roma. v, c Tho. Aq. in episto. ad Heb. 13 Nicol. de Lyra me
pistol. ad Phil. ca, 2
And how Gods favor is obtaynd,
from whence we were exilde,
The mean we seek to understand,
how man is reconcilde.
Your Romish church does falsely teach
in works of men to trust,
And righteousness in vain to seek,
through merits of the just.
But Scripture teaches contrary, Esaias. 43. d Romans iii, b

that righteousness is none,
Whereby man can be iustefyed, Galat. ii. d

in works that here be done.
But righteousness that shall avail
and ever more remain, Romans iii, e Psalm, 118

By faith in Jesus Christ his death, Gala, iii, a

alone we do obtain.
Before God he is iustefyed
whom God for just does take, Phil, iij. b Gala, iii, b Ephesi. i. a Acts, 13,
f

And does acquit as Innocent,
even for his mercies sake.
This Justification then is wrought, Ambr. in Psalm. 118 sermon. 10 Acts. 13, f
2. Cor. 5. d

when God does sin forgive,
And does impute Christ's righteousness
to such as do believe.
When man to grace God first did call
his mercy for to show, 2, Tim, 1, c Augu. in Psalm. 31.

What work of man did once him move
such mercy to bestow?
He chose us of his own accord, Esai, 43. d Ambr de vocatione Gent. lib. 1. ca.
5.

not as he did foresee
The worthynes of any work
that afterward should be.
Math, 7, c
The tree thus being all corrupt,
what good fruit can it bring?
Iam. iij. c
What water clear once can proceed
from foul and filthy spring?
Psalm, 13. a
Even such is man with all his thoughts
Romans iij. b Augus. in Psalm. 31.
his words and works he has,
All is corrupt, and does deserve
of God nothing but wrath.
Apoc. 17. d Esaias. 36. c Chriso in episto. ad Romans ca. 1
If any thing be worthy praise,
if any work be good,
By grace the same is wrought in us,
the praise is due to God.
The natural strength of man's free will
Ioh, xv, a
whereof so much you boast,
Phili. ij. b
Not one good work can work in us,
that freedom now is lost.
Eccle. xv. c Augu. de verbis Apost. sermo. 2.
When man was create, then he had
the power of free will,
To stand in grace, and had the choice,
so to continue still.
Augu. in inchir. ad Laurentium. ca. 29
But so his will he did abuse,
he lost him self withal,
That rise he could not by his strength,
his will he made it thrall.
Therefore what Satan moves to, Roma, 6, c Genesis viij. d

we do it readilye,
As captives all he does us lead,
Christ only makes free. Ioh. viij. a

His holy spirit does give the grace
all godly works to choose, Roma, v, a Gene. xx. Ezech. xj. d Iere. 31. c

It is his only gift also
that sin we do refuse.
Were it not to great iniurye,
the inheritance to claim,
Of lands or goods that were but lent,
a while to use the same?
No less trespass it is to God,
to challenge as our right, Deuteronomy. 8. d

The power to work a godly work,
which is his only gift. James. i. c

Then seeing no good work we have, Esai. 43. d Iere. 13. d Rom, iii. b

what righteousness can be?
What merit, where nothing does reign
but great iniquity?
Yea though we be regenerate, John. iij. a

and borne in Christ again,
No work yet here so perfect is, Esa. 64. b Luk, 17, c

Gods favor to obtain.
Esa. 64. b Psalm. 51. c
Our righteousness all stained is,
whose heart is pure within?
Who lives here so innocent,
Job. ix. c
that daily does not sin?
Job. 25. c
The stars that be in firmament,
are not pure in Gods sight,
Joel. ij. c
The Sun and Moon comparde to him,
at all they give no light.
Job. xv. b xxv, a Aug. lib. 9. confessionum.
Then Man that is corruption,
how can he iustefye
Him self, when God as judge shall sit,
his righteousness to try?
But when we have done what we can
Luke 17. c
even then both more and less
Unprofitable servants all
our selves let us confess.
Our duty for we have but done,
nothing here can be found.
Of supererogation,
in works that does abound.
If any thing we do besides,
that God does not require,
It is but sin, and does deserve
nothing but wrath and ire.
A free gift is our righteousness, Romans 6. d. Chris. in episto. ad Romans ca. 1
Ephe. ii. b Romans iii. d

obtained all by grace,
Least any man should boast him self,
our works here have no place.
For where to works reward is due,
there grace is none at all, Gala. v. a

The work once done, the workman may
by right for wages call. Romans iii. a

Thus make you God in debt to man,
if that without delay
The hyre that we have labourd for, To. iiii. a

he do not truly pay.
But those that in ye vineyard wrought
a penny did receive,
Not as their labors did exceed,
but as the Lord it gave.
So our inheritance in heaven,
by promise free we have, Gal. iii. c

Mercy does measure all reward, Romans ix. d

no merits can it crave.
Their righteousness who leans to,
Christ's righteousness does leese, Romans x. a

All works reiecte, the Publicane
by faith the Lord did please. Luke 18. c

Gene. xv. b
And Abraham his righteousness
by faith he did obtain,
Rom, 4. b
Because to God his promise made
constant he did remain.
Romans iij. d
So freely are we iustefied
by Christ's redemption,
Through faith sure fixed in his blood
we have remission.
As Jacob did his father please
the garment having on
That was his brothers, and thereby
the blessing gat anon:
So in Gods presence when we shall
at any time appear,
Christ's righteousness the garment
that we must only wear.
Ambros. lib. 2. de Jacob et vita beata cap. 2.
The sweet savor that Isaac felt
our faith does signify,
The smell whereof so pleases God,
it does us iustefye.
Galat. ii, d Ambr. in episto. ad Rom, ca. 3
Faith is the hand wherewith we reach
forgeuenes of our sin,
For this we say our righteousness
only does stand therein.
Faith only therefore and no works Augu. in Psalm. 31. Chris. in episto. ad
Romans ca. 1

does sinners iustefye,
Because Christ's righteousness to us
alone it does apply.
Faith it does purifye the heart, Act. xv. b Hebr, xj, a Augu. in Psalm. 31.

then God does us accept,
From Faith if they do not proceed,
all works he does reject.
Abell therefore God did regard, Genesis iiii. a Hebre. xi, ^

his offryng he did choose,
But Cain and his sacrifice,
as wicked did refuse.
Yet mean we not of such a Faith,
as fruit has none at all,
For that which dead is without works Iame. ii, c

true Faith we cannot call.
But Faith which is effectual, Galat. v, a Abacu. ij. a

whereby the just does live,
As fire his heat always does yield, Iame, ij, d

so good fruit does it give.
As time does serve, and need require, i, Ioh, 3, c Galat. v. a

so Faith does work withal,
Therefore good works through only Faith
are not destroyed at all.
Iam, ii. c, Galat, v, o Romans iij. c iiij. a
The company of godly works,
Faith evermore does love,
But when our Faith does iustefy,
then works we do remove.
Roma, x, b
For unto Faith is promised
all our salvation,
Galat, il, c
Which to obtain, no works can help,
but power of Faith alone.
But here the slau^derous tongue does say,
good works we need not have,
It is lost labor to live well,
sith works no man can save.
But faithful works they have this end
to glorify our God,
Math. v. b
When other seeing them so shine,
his praise does spread abroad.
Psalm, 18, a
The Sun, the Moon, and eke the stars,
they all created are,
The glory of God throughout the world
here daily to declare.
Then might the love of God alone
move us continually,
Romans ii. d
To show forth fruits of godly works,
his name to gloryfy.
Besides the help the nedy have, Mat. 25. ^

by works commanded here,
Our faith by such her fruits is known Phil. 25. d Galat. v. a

and living does appear.
For Faith does show obedience, Iam. ij. c

in outward righteousness,
Else dead it is and counterfeit
the faith that we profess.
We are now saved from our foes, Luke. i. g

from danger and distres,
To serve the Lord without all fear
in perfect holiness.
Darkness we are no longer now Ephe, ij, d

but clear light in the Lord,
In newnes of a godly life i 1, Cor, 6, c Titus. 2, b

to walk with one accord.
These may persuade unto good works
though not to trust therein, 1. Pet. 1. c i. The. 4. a i. Pet. 4. a

Our calling unto grace does move
a new life to begin.
And least we should faint by the way, Hebr. vi. c Phil. ii. c Hebre. x. g
Apoc. is. c

or think our labor vain,
Unto good works is promised
reward of heavenly gain.
Esaias. 43. d
Not for the work of his reward,
nor yet for our desert,
Ephe. ij, b
But does proceed of mere good will,
not due in any part.
Chriso. in episto. ad Romans ca. 1 Aug. super Ioh. trac. 3
For as good works they be his gift,
when God does them regard,
So does he crown his own in us,
when he does them reward.
Dani. ix, b Barn. ij. b Apoc. iij. d Osea. xiii. c
To us nothing belongs, but
shame and confusion,
To thee O Lord the praise is due
of our salvation.
Apoc, iij, d
Therefore as we be poor in deed,
and destitute of grace,
Even so let us confess the same,
in truth, before his face.
Who craves alms being rich,
of silver having store?
All beggars show their poor estate,
thereby to move the more.
Apoc. iii, d
So if we come as rich in works
to God, how can we speed?
i, Pet, v, b
Such beggars proud he does refuse,
to help in time of need.
The tree does lift it self aloft,
that has least fruit thereon,
But where great plenty grows most
it boweth down anon.
So are we proud, and yet but poor, Esa, xliii, ^ Roma. 7. c

no goodness we have here,
Though we live well, yet evermore
let us fall down in fear. Dani, ix, b

And so not in our righteousness, Baru, ij, d Psalm, 50, c

but for his mercies sake,
To God in time of troubles great, Bar, iij, a

our prayers we will make.
As unto godly works in Christ, Ephe. ii. b Ephe. v. d Hebr, xii. g

we all be created.
So let us warely walk therein,
as God has ordained.
Forsaking all our former sins, i, Pet, 4. a

renude in heart and mind,
Least unto Christ our Savior, Ephesians, iiii, ^ Colo, iii, ^

we show our selves unkind.
Who by his death did us redeem, Gala, 4, ^ Apoca. v. c ii, Cor, ii, c Roma.
7. ^

not to our selves to live,
But unto him, his life for us,
that did so freely give.
Psalm. 67
O God be merciful to us,
and bless us plenteously,
The brightness of thy countenance
show us continually.
Esaias. 52.
That we on earth thy ways may learn
and ever think thereon,
And that all nations here may know
thy saving health alone.
