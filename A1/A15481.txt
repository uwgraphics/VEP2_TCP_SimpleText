THE ART OF MEMORY, So far forth as it depends upon Places and Idea's.

To the Reader.
WHereas about some two or three years since, I published a Tractate in Latin
called Mnemonia, concerning the Art of Memory: divided into three books,
according to the threefold kinds of Artificial remembering, that are therein
prescribed; and have been since importuned by diverse ^o publish it in English:
I have answered their request, so far as I judged it fit, by publishing the
third book thereof, which is plain and easy for any man's understanding;
whereas the two first books are for Scholars only, that are skillful in
Logic and Poetry. Yet have I not tied my self to such strict laws as a
Translator should, but have altered where I thought good, the precepts,
examples, and method^ thereof, with all liberty, to make it the more easy for
the understanding of the common sort Writings (I confess) are simply the most
happy keepers of any thing in memory, and does for speed and certainty go
beyon^ any art of Memory: but a man cannot always write that which comes
into his mind, (as when he is riding upon a journey, or lies awake in his
bed, or is among company at dinner, or in a throng of people, or is otherwise
hindered by any the like occasion) therefore it will be necessary for him
then, to help his memory some other way, at least till he can set down that
in writing, which he would remember. And to this purpose serves this Art;
which if you shall advisedly read through, and mark with diligence the
precepts and examples, that you may well understand every Chapter, as you go
along, without hastening to the end, before you come to it by due order, (like
a man that would leap over a style before he comes at it) I doubt not but you
shall find it very plain and easy, and exceeding profitable for remembrance
both of businesses and observations, and no way hurtful to the faculty of the
natural memory; but rather very useful for the corroboration and
strengthening thereof. For the memory being daily accustomed to the recalling
of sentences forgotten, and that by one or two words thereof, (as this book
directs) is thereby much quickened in her duty, and the wit the more
sharpened. For nothing requires continual exercise more then the memory:
neither is there any faculty that waxes sooner dull for want of exercise,
then the memory. This one thing I desire to be favorably censured, that if in
the examples which I give for the illustration of the practice of this Art in
the fourteenth Chapter, there appear ought to be fantastical, it may be
excused by this reason, that in this Art I go about to instruct the fantasy,
which is the servant of memory. In which respect it fitteth well, that I
deliver some conceits which are fantastical. And thus have I ventured to put
these my labors upon common construction, hoping they shall find no less
favorable acceptance among the judicious, then the Art of Stenographie, which
long since I published, has found.

THE ART OF MEMORY.
CHAP. I. Of the Repositorie.
THe Art of Memory, so far forth as it depends upon Places and Idea's,
consists of two parts: Reposition, and Deposition. Reposition is that part,
whereby things to be remembered, are laid up in mind by their Idea's, bestowed
in the places of Repositories. But before I come to the manner of bestowing or
laying up Idea's in the places of Repositories, necessary it is that I should
severally entreat, first concerning Repositories; secondly the places therein
determined; and thirdly touching Idea's in those places bestowed.

A Repositorie is an imaginary house or building, the form and fashion whereof
is as follows: Let there be supposed a building of the best Cane stone to
stand before us, the inside whereof is in length twelve yards, in breadth six
yards, and in height seven yards, and the roof thereof flat, leaded above, and
pargetted underneath, having no wall at all upon the hither side which is
toward us, but the whole house lying wide open to our view. Let there be also
supposed within the said building, a marble stage smoothe and even, one yard
high above the level of the ground, whereon we stand; extending it self the
full length and breadth of the said building. And that all the three walls of
the house (that is to say, the opposite wall, and the two side walls) are wholly
lined on the inside with choice cypress boords, plain and smoothe, and so
close joined, that it bears no mention thereof to be seen, unto a man
standing upon this side of the stage. Furthermore, let there be imagined a
grooue or gutter to be cut in the just middle of the marble stage, three inches
deep, and three inches broad, drawn from the opposite wall to the hither
side of the stage, whereby it is exactly divided into two equal parts: And
that upon the further end of the said gutter, there is erected a Corinthian or
round pillar, one foot and an half thick, arising up to the roof of the
building, which almost touches the opposite wall, and deuideth it exactly into
two equal parts; as the grooue divides the stage. So that by the grooue and
the pillar the whole Repositorie is parted in twain, and consists of two
rooms siding each other, and being each of them six yards long, and six yards
broad, and six yards high. But that you may the better perceive this
description, behold here the type and fashion of the Repositorie, limited by
the letters contained therein; whose signification follows after the Figure.

a b shows the length of (...) Repositorie.

a c and b d the height there^^

c g o p the stage of the first ^^ome.

r q k h the wall of the second ^^ome.

s r h f the stage of the second room.

n o the pillar dividing t^^ opposite wall.

o p the grooue wrought in the stage.

And such a fashioned Rep^sitorie are we to prefixe before the eyes of our
mind, as oft^^ as we intend to commit thin^ to memory, supposing o^ selves to
be right against t^^ midst thereof, and in the d^stance of two yards ther^ from.

Now although every Rep^sitorie which we feign to b^ before us, must be of the
sam^ fashion and building; yet a^ they to be distinguished on^ from another, by
the seueral^ colors of their pillars. For there are eighteen Repositori^ in
all, which are thus disti^guished: The pillar of the first (...) of gold; the
pillar of the se^ond of silver: both of them ^ery bright and polished. The
pillars of the next seven, must be supposed to be every of them of one entire
stone smooth and shining, and thus d^ff^renced one from another. The color of
the pillar in the third Repositorie must be black; in the fourth Repositorie,
blue; in the fifth, red; in the sixth, yellow; in the seventh, green; in in the
eighth, purple; in the ninth, white: so that these first nine Repositories have
but one pillar apiece in them; the other nine are supposed to have two,
standing together, in the middle of the Repositorie, close to the opposite
wall; the one upon the one side of the grooue, and the other upon the other
side thereof, touching each other, and the opposite wall with their bases,
diuersified one from another, by a repetition of the nine former colors in the
same order. For both the pillars in the tenth house or Repositorie, must be
imagined to be of gold: both pillars in the eleventh house, of silver; in the
twelfth house of two entire black stones smooth and shining; in the thirteenth
of two entire blue stones: and so likewise in the rest. And thus much
concerning the Repositories or imaginary houses, and how they are distinguished.

CHAP. II. Of Places.
A Place (as it is considered in this Art) is a room ^etermined in the
Repositorie, (...) for receiving the Idea's or ^ormes of things thereinto. In
^uery Repositorie are two places ^r rooms, and no more: which reseuered each
from other, by ^he grooue and pillar, accor^ing to the manner prescribed (...)
the former Chapter. For ^l that space, which occupies ^he whole half part of
the Re^ositorie upon the left hand, is ^ounted the first place thereof: and all
that space of the other ^alfe part of the Repositorie vp^n the right hand, is
counted the second place. And so much concerning the places.

CHAP. III. Of Idea's in general.
AN Idea is a visible representation of ought to b^ remembered, bestowed by the
Imagination in one of the places of a Repositarie, by the remembrance whereof
we ca^ to mind that which was there by signified.

Every Idea is to be accompanied with its proper circumstances, as the nature
thereon does require. For as any writing, the fairer it is written the better
it is read: so by ho^ much the more lively the Idea'^ are set forth, according
(...) (...) exigence of their nature, much the sooner are they ^ed to mind, and
by them, (...) things also committed to ^mory. Therefore to the I^'s of things
moving, the ^e same motion is to be a^bed; and to the Idea's of ^ngs giving a
sound, that self ^e sound is to be attributed. ^amples of Idea's whereun^
motion is ascribed, are, an ^ificer at work in his shop, ^n and women dancing,
wa^ running from a spout, and ^ch like. Examples of Idea's ^hereunto sound is
given, are ^ion roaring, a Faulkner lu^g, a bell ringing, a Quirister ^ging, a
noice of Musicians, ^d the like. Finally, every I^a ought to have such setting
^t, as seems in special manner appropriated thereun^ that it may be the
better (...) prehended by the memory.

In every Idea we have for things to be considered. Qu^titie, Position, Color,
(...) Kind. Of which four I (...) entreat in their order.

CHAP. IIII. Concerning the Quantity of Idea's.
AN Idea, in respect of (...) Quantity, is either Equ^ Augmented, or
Contracted.

An Equal Idea is such, (...) whereby the thing to be (...) membred, being
neither (...) great, but that it may be contained in one of the places; (...)
so small, but being there ^^owed, it may easily be seen (...) one that
stands two yards (...) this side the stage; is there^re placed in its equal
and ^e quantity. Of which sort ^e a chair, a table, a bedsteed ^rnished, a
heap of grain, a ^acke of wood, a duel fought ^etweene two combatants, and
the like.

An Idea augmented, is such, (...) whereby the thing to be re^embred being so
small, as ^eing it self alone bestowed (...) one of the places of the
Re^sitorie, cannot be seen of him (...) at stands two yards in this ^de the
stage, must therefore ^e augmented by the increase ^f the number, of that which
is (...) be placed. vt Quae non pro^nt singula multa invent. As ^r example: if
the Idea to be bestowed, be a pearl, a peni^^ a grain of mustard seed, o^^
spider: these things are (...) themselves so small, as bei^ disposed in one of
the plac^ of the Repositorie, they cann^ be seen in the foremention^ distance.
Therefore for o^ pearl I suppose a bushel (...) pearls to be heaped in t^
middle of one of the places; (...) one penny an heap of pen^ new coined; for
one grai^ of mustard seed, a coome (...) mustard seed in like mann^ heaped
together: for one sp^der, I suppose a multitude (...) spiders creeping close
togeth^ in the midst of the oppos^ wall.

An Idea Contracted is suc^ as whereby the thing to be r^membred being so
great, the ^a^not be contained in so nar^^w limits, as the place of a
^positorie is; is therefore sup^sed to be painted in lively ^lours, upon that
half of the ^posite wall which belongs (...) the place wherein this Idea
(...) to be bestowed. For all vi^le things in the world, ^ough never so great,
and ne^r so far disterminate, may ^ry easily be represented by a ^cture
drawn upon the wall (...) this contracted form. As if ^e thing to be
remembered be (...) Church, a City, a mountain, (...) comet, or other
prodigious ^^gne in the heaven, a field ^^ught, a fight at sea, a trium^ant
passage in pomp and state, (...) hunting or hawking through ^^e spacious
forests, or any ^^her the like, whose Idea in the full bigness, cannot (...)
contained in a place of the R^positorie; All these are to be (...) forth in a
picture, occupyi^ the one half of the oppos^ wall, that in this attenuat^ form
it maybe fully expresse^ within the bounds and limi^ of its proper place. And
(...) much concerning the Quantity of Idea's: come we ne^ to their Position.

CHAP. V. Of the Position of Idea's.
LEt the position or situ^tion of every Idea be su^ as is most agreeable to t^
thing signified thereby. F^ those things which we commonly hang upon a wall,
(...) ^ten thereunto, are here also (...) like manner to be used. As if ^e Idea
be some picture of a ^an; because it is the use of a ^cture to be hung upon a
wall, ^e must therefore suppose it (...) hang upon the opposite (...) all: if it
be a Proclamation (...) Title page of a book, that (...) is pasted unto the
wall; if it ^e a new Pamphlet, that it is ^stned to the wall with nails; (...)
it be a Tomb, we must fan^e it to be set up close to the (...) all, and the
streamers and ^endants to be fastened aloft unto the opposite and side wall ^f
the same room, wherein ^is Idea is to be placed. So the things which are wont
to be ^laced upon a court-cupboord ^r shelfe, are to have like place ^ere: as a
garnish of plate, or vessels of glass upon a court c^boord; books or merce^
wares bestowed upon shelue^ Those things which be acc^stomed to be upon tables,
(...) imagined here also to ha^ place upon a table: of whi^sort are a banquet,
moneys to out into several heaps, pla^ing tables, etc. Things plac^ upon the
ground, are here lik^wise supposed to have pla^ upon the marble stage, as a
t^ble, chest, cradle, or any liuin^ creature standing, sitting, g^ing or lying
along, etc. Thin^ which are commonly and vs^ally under ground, are here
su^posed to be under the stag^ For although they cannot b^ seen of him that
stands o^ this side the stage with his b^dily eyes, yet they are no^ ^dden
from the eyes of his ^ind, which only are exerci^d in this Art. Examples of
^is kind are a grave, a well, a ^ine seller, a mine of gold, sil^er, lead, etc.
Finally, the selfe^ me order is to be observed (...) the site and position of
all ^ther Idea's.

CHAP. VI. Of the Colors of Idea's.
COme we now to the third thing belonging to Idea's, which is Color. Every
Idea ^n what Repositorie soever it stands, must have the color of the same
Repository in whole ^or in part attributed unto it. As if a black bull be to
have the place of an Idea in any of the two rooms of the first Repositorie,
the horns thereof mu^^ be supposed to be gilded; if i^ any place of the second
Repositorie, the horns must be supposed to be tipped with silver: i^ it be
placed in the third Repositorie, the proper color there^^ being black
already, is sufficient of it self whereby to remember the house wherein it
stands. If he be best^wed in the fourth Repositorie, then le^ him have a
garland of blue flowers about his neck; if in the fifth Repositorie, a garland
of Damask roses: if in the sixth, of Marygolds: if in the seventh, a w^eath of
Bays; if in the eight, of Cloue Iuly-flowers; if in the ninth, of Lillies.

Furthermore, in attributing the color of any Repositorie (...) an Idea
therein placed, not ^articipating it of it self, we ^ust have a care that it
be ap^lied as near as we can to that ^art which is most spectable and
conspicuous. As if the hi^^ry of Jonas the Prophet be ^ainted upon any half
part of ^he opposite wall in the first ^epositorie, although therein ^e to be
painted heaven, earth, ^a, land, a whale, a ship with ^ariners in it; yet
because Io^as being the subject of the hi^^ory, is the most spectable part ^f
the picture, we may imagine ^he hems of his upper garment ^o be of gold: as we
see it used ^rdinarily in pictures printed, wrought in distemper, and
var^ished. So if the picture of Io^as be an Idea in the second Repositorie, the
hems of his vesture may be siluered: if in the third Repositorie, we may
imagine his upper garment to b^ of the color of black; if i^ the fourth, of
blue; if in the fifth, of red, etc. And thus much concerning the attribution o^
the color of the Repositories to the Idea's therein contained* come we now to
the several kinds of Idea's.

CHAP. VII. Of Direct Idea's.
AN Idea is simple or compound. A simple Idea i^ uniform; and is either Direc^
or Oblique.

A Direct Idea is such, a^ whereby a thing truly visible, or conceived under a
visible form, is laid up in the same form under which it is conceived. So a
goat is the direct Idea of a goat, a peacocke of a peacocke, a dove of a
dove, a Church of a Church, a book of a book, etc. So the Idea of any friend
or acquaintance, is his true proper shape. So good and evil Angels, although
they be spirits incorporeall and invisible, yet since they are commonly
conceived under visible forms, they are so to be expressed. Finally, of all
things visible, or conceived under a visible form the mind it self does
presently offer direct or right Idea's, that we shall not need to invent any
other, but to use them which are offered unto us. For if any shall make a
narration unto us of a skirmish at sea, do we not presently suppose our selves
to see before the eyes of our mind, the sea ships, smoke of the gunnes
discharged, and such like things as belong to a fight at sea? If any speak of
mustering and training men, do we not fashion to our minds a certain form of
a field, wherein soldiers march after their colors in a military order?
Neither ^s there ought else h^re prescribed, then that which nature it self
has taught us, saving that for our better taking hold upon these natural
Ideas, we observe an artificial order and manner in laying them up in mind,
that we may the sooner find them. And so much for a Direct Idea.

CHAP. VIII. Of Relative Idea's.
AN oblique Idea is such, as whereby the thing to be remembered, is obliquely or
indirectly signified. An oblique Idea is threefold: Relative, Subdit^^a l. or
Scriptile.

A Relative is a simple Idea, whereby the thing to be remembered, is expressed
by his his Correlatiue; as, first, when the cause is signified by the effect:
As when Melancholy is signified by a man very sad, who having his arms
wreathed up, and his hatt pull^d down in his eyes, goes up and down in a
discontented manner. The Spring time, by the green fields, and the trees
putting forth their leaves. Winter, by the nakedness of trees, and the lakes and
rivers frozen up.

Secondly, when the effect is signified by the cause. As if I should signify
Oppression of the poor, by a covetous miser, who is every where ill spoken of
for his violence and extortion: or Blasphemy, by a prodigious blasphemous
wretch well known unto us, all whose speech is stuffed with dreadful oaths
and blasphemies.

Thirdly, when the Subject is noted by the Adiunct: As when the Imperial
dignity is signified by a Crown and Scepter. A wine Tavern by an ivy bush
and red lattice, etc.

Fourthly, when the Adiunct ^s noted by the Subject: As when Cold is signified
by ice; Heat by fire; Light by a can^le; Affection by the heart, which is the
seat of affections; Pride, by a Peacock; Gluttony ^y an Estrich; Drunkenness
^y a drunken man; Impudence ^y an harlot; Covetousness, by (...) rich man with
his bags about him, and such like.

Fifthly, when the like is put for the like: As Parallel circles (that is,
circles equally distant, including one another) for the world, because the
world consists of spheres, including one another, as parallel circles do. A
woman holding a broken pillar, for Fortitude. A virgin having her eyes covered
with a veil, holding a sword in one hand, and a pair of balance in the
other, for Justice. An old man winged, having long hair in the forepart of his
head, and being bald behind, for Time. And the like.

Si^ (...) ^en a sentence is expressed (...) a familiar example, whereby the
truth of that sentence is manifested: as, if this sentence [ Venture mero
aestuans despumat in libidinem: that is, The belly ouer-heated with wine, does
froath forth into lust,] should be expressed by the example of Lot, sporting
with his daughters; in whose fa^l, this example was plainly verified.

Finally, when any thing may fitly be resembled by its correlatiue, it must be
so resembled. And so much for Relative Idea's.

CHAP. IX. Of Subdititiall Idea's.
A Subdititiall Idea is, whereby a proper name is com^itted to memory, by
some^^ing placed in stead there of, wherewith it is supposed to (...) have some
agreement. This (...) done two ways.

First, when a man's name ^gnifieth something visible, it ^ay be laid up in
memory by that visible thing it signifies: As if a man's name be Smith, his
name may be remembered by ^hinking upon a Smith at work ^n one of the rooms of
the Repositorie, having forge and ^nvile in it, as if it were a Smiths shop: if
his name be Carpenter, by a Carpenter (...) work: if Turner, by a Turne^ if
his name be Stone, by (...) stone: if Lu^onne, by a Lute an^ a Tun.

Secondly, a man's name m^ be remembered by the lik^ name given to another man As
if a man's name be Pete^ we may remember it by another man called Peter, or b^
the picture of Saint Peter hun^ upon the opposite wall: if h^ name be
Iohnsonne, by another man of the same name: if a w^mans name be Lucrese, it man
be kept in mind by the pictur^ of Lucrese: if Katharine, by the picture of
Saint Katharine. An^ this may suffice for Subditia^ Idea's.

CHAP. X. Of Scriptile Idea's.
A Scriptile Idea is, whereby the thing to be remem^red, is supposed to be
written ^n a plain white table hanged ^p in the midst of the opposite wall
belonging to the room wherein it is placed, the frame ^r border whereof is of
oak, very broad and chamfered. In every Scriptile Idea, 3 things are generally
required.

First, that the Table be not much bigger then will contain that which shall
be written in it.

Secondly, that the frame or border of the Table, be of the color of the
Repository, wherein it stands. As if it stand in the first Repositorie, that
it be of the color o^ gold; if in the second Repositorie, that it be of the
color of silver; if in the third, that it be black; if in the fourth, blue,
etc.

Thirdly, that the letters contained in the Scriptile Idea, be all of such
bigness^, as that they may plainly be read by him that stands on this side of
the Repositorie; like unto the writings which we see in Churches. And thus much
for that which is generally required in all Scriptile Idea's. Let us now see,
what is further to be required in the several kinds of them.

There are four kinds of Scriptile Idea's: A single word, a Quotation, a
Phrase, and (...) Sentence.

A single word and quota^ion, must be written in a ta^let one foot and an
half ^road, and a foot high; and their first letter must be a great Roman
capital letter of ex^raordinary bigness above the ^est, and the
transcendencies of ^he small letters also, if there be any must be drawn much
^igher or lower then is usual ^n common writing. For by ^his means they are
the more easily attracted by the visuall faculty, and transferred to the
memory. By the transcendencies of the small letters, I mean the upper and lower
parts of those letters, which exceed the parallel lines between which we
write. For whenever we write, we write, as it were, between two lines
understood, though not expressed. And of the small letters, some are written
wholly between the lines, as these, a c e m n o r s u v w, which for distinction
sake may be called Interlineals, because they are written between the lines.
All other small letters are extended further then the lines, whereof they are
called Transcendents. And of these, some are extended above the upper line, as
these, b d h i k l t: some beneath the lower line, as these, g p q x y z. Some
both above the upper line and beneath the nether line, as these, f j s. As to
give examples in single words: the word Canaan has no transcendents in it;
Naboth has three, which extend above the upper line, b t and h. Spagyrus
three, which are ^rawne beneath the nether ^ne, p g and y. Iosaphat has ^hree
transcende^ces above the ^pper line, in the letters s h and (...) and two
beneath the lower ^ne, in the letters s and p.

When therefore we have ^ancied a single word to be ^ritten in a tablet hanging
upon the opposite wall, we must apply our mind thereun^o impensiuely to
consider it, and especially the length of it, ^he first letter, and the
transcen^encies of the small letters if ^here be any, till by these
con^ideratio^s the word make some ^mpression of it self in our ^inds. That,
whereas a word ^arely written, is but feeble of (...) self to stir up memory,
yet ^y these considerations and stay made in bestowing it, (...) may work some
deeper impression in our memories.

A Quotation must be written after the common manner thus, 2. Chron. 9.6. Math.
5.8. And besides the consideration of the first letter, and the tra^scendences
of the small letters if there be any in it, we mus^ observe also the numbers o^
the Chapter and verse, but specially of the Chapter; which will be very easy
to commi^ to mind, in regard of their quantity. For things of quantity, next
things visible, are be^ remembered.

A phrase and a short sentence of one line in length must be supposed to be
written in a table three foot broa^ and one foot high, and the ^hiefe word
therein, which is (...) be accounted, that which ^ost expresses the subject
^ereof, (whether it stand in ^^e beginning, middle or end) (...) to be written
after the man^er of words written alone; that is, the first letter to be a
^^eat Roman capital letter, and the transcendencies of the ^^all letters
therein very large.) and when we have once fan^ed a phrase or short sentence
(...) be written in the table, we ^ust apply our selves to con^der the length
of this whole ^criptile Idea, specially the ^hiefe word therein, and what ^ace
it has in the writing, (...) whether in the beginning, ^iddle or end:) for by
these ^onsiderations used in the Re^osition of Scriptile Idea's, they are the
better remembered.

If a Scriptile Idea be a lon^ sentence, which cannot be contained in a line,
then let the table be imagined to be bro^der or deeper, as the length (...) the
Idea does require. An^ let the form of writing, which every long Idea has, be
suc^ as may most plainly set foot^ what kind of sentence it do^ express.
Therefore Distrib^tions must be expressed by the parts drawn to their whol^
with braces in this manner. The feasts of the Jews besides the Sabbaths, were
either More solemn: to wit, The Passover. Pentecost. The feast of Tabernacles.
Less solemn: to wit, The feasts of their new Moons. The feast of blowing
Tru^pets. The feast of Expiation.




So Syllogismes are to be distinguished into their Proposition, Assumption and
Conclusion, as: If the first matter of all corporeal creatures be capable of
any form; then though the bodies of all men were, dissolved into their first
matter, they may be restored to their proper form again. But the first matter
of all corporeal creatures is capable of any form: according to that
Philosophical Axiom, Materia prima est omnium formarum susceptibilis.
Therefore though the bodies of all men were dissolved into their first matter,
they may be restored to their proper form again.


So Objections with their Answers, are to be distinguished in this manner.

Objection.
Whatsouer every man must believe, is true. (For nothing false must be
believed.)

But every wicked man must believe that he shall be saved by Christ. (For not
to believe this is infidelity, and therefore sin.)

Therefore every wicked man must believe that he shall be saved.

Answer.
Every wicked man must believe that he shall be saved; yet not absolutely, but
upon condition that he repent, and believe in Christ.

Similitudes and all other comparisons both whose parts are explicated, are to
have those parts siding one another in this sort: As there is great difference
between the faculty of light and the act of seeing: (for the faculty is
always present with him that has his sight; but the act is often
intermitted.) So there is a great difference between the faculty of faith and
the act of believing: (for the faculty of faith is always in the Regenerate
after their conversion; but the act of believing is sometimes interrupted.)


So verses are to be distinguished by their several lines: and generally all
other kinds of sentences which have or may have a peculiar kind of writing by
it self, ought here in that manner to be written.

Furthermore, it is requisite, that over a long Scriptile Idea, one or two of
the chiefest words be written in some little ^istance therefrom, as if it were
the title of it, their first ^etter being a great Roman ^apitall, and the
transcenden^ies of the small letters produ^ed in length, after the manner of
words written alone. As to give instance in the former ex^mples: over the first
Scrip^ile Idea, (which is a distribu^ion) these words must be written, Jewish
Feasts. Over ^he second, (which is a Syllogism) these, First Matter. Over the
third (which is an Ob^ection with the solution thereof) these, Believe
salvation. Over the fourth, (which is a similitude) these, Sight and Faith. And
having in our conceits written any long Idea after this manner, we must apply
our selves intensiuely t^ consider the length of the sentence, the manner of
writing i^ and the title thereof over i^ together with the first letter^ and
transcendences of the title, letting our mind to wor^ upon these considerations
for a while, till the Idea be somewhat settled therein.

CHAP. XI. Of compound Idea's.
Having now gone thorough with all the simple Idea's, I come to Idea'^ that are
compounded. A compound Idea, is compounde^ of two simple Idea's; whereof the
one is always a Scriptil^ Idea, and the other is either (...) Direct Idea, or
a Relative. A compound Idea therefore is of two sorts.

The first kind of compound ^dea's, is of them which consist partly of a Direct
Idea, ^artly of a Scriptile. Of this ^ort are, an history painted in (...)
fair table, with verses vnder^^ath explaining it; a libell or Epigramme, made
upon some thing done, supposed to be written in a paper, and pasted upon the
opposite wall, and ^he thing done expressed in ac^ion upon the stage; An armed
Knight bearing his Scutcheon and imprese written therein; and the like.

The second kind of com^ound Idea's, is of them which consist partly of a
Relative Idea, and partly of a Scriptile. Of this sort are innumerable examples
in Emblemes, written by Beza, Alciat, Peacham, and others. For in all Emblemes,
the picture occupying the upper part of the table, is (...) Relative Idea; and
that which is written underneath, a Scriptile. And thus much for compound
Ideas, and so concerning all the several kinde^ of Idea's.

CHAP. XII. Of the choosing Idea's.
IT is meet in the next place, to give such rules, whereby we may know at the
first, with what Idea every thing that is to be remembered, must be expressed.
Touching which, these six Rules following give infal^ible and certain
direction.

Rule 1. All histories, things done, fables, common businesses, finally
whatsoever is visible or conceived under a visible form, and nor illustrated
by ought written, ought to be ^ayd up in memory, by a Di^ect Idea in equal
quantity, greater or less, as the nature of the Idea requires.

Rule 2. All histories, things done, fables, morals, and the ^^ke, explaned by
verses or other writing: as also all Epigrams, Epitaphs, Anagrams, ^mpreses,
and libels, are to be expressed by an Idea compounded of a Direct Idea and a
Scriptile.

Rule 3. All Emblemes and sentences exemplified by some notable instance, are
to be expressed by a compound Idea, consisting of a Relative and Scriptile Idea.

Rule 4. All Charact^rs, solitary letters, bare numbers, and quotations, are to
be laid up by a Scriptile Idea.

Rule 5. All single words and proper names, expressible by a Subditiall Idea,
ought so to be expressed.

Rule 6. All sentences, phrases, words or names which can not presently be
expressed by a Direct, a Relative, a Subdititiall, or a compound Idea, ought to
be expressed by a Scriptile Idea. And this for the choice of Idea's shall
suffice.

CHAP. XIII. Of the manner of bestowing Idea's in their places.
HItherunto I have entreated concerning Repositories, Places and Idea's
severally. Now I come to the manner of bestowing Ideas in the places of
Repositories. Wherein these rules following are to be observed.

Rule 1. Every Idea is to be placed in order: that is to say, that which
comes first to mind, in the first place of the first Repositorie: That which
comes next to mind, in the second place of the first Repositorie; The third
Idea in the first place of the second Repositorie. The fourth, in the second
place thereof. The fifth, in the first place of the third Repositorie. The sixth,
in the second. And so forth in the rest of the Repositories, how many soever
they be: always provided, there be but one Idea assigned to one place.

Rule 2. Let due quantity, position, and the color of the Repositorie be
rightly attributed to every Idea, and thoroughly observed and marked, as
belonging thereunto. For it can not well be told, how much help and furtherance
these 3 attributions, specially the assigning of the color of the Repositorie
to every Idea, do bring to a deep imprinting in the memory, as well as the
Idea's themselves, as also the order wherein they stand. For by this means the
mind, when it comes to repeat over the Idea's, has one thing certainly
known to belong to every Idea to work upon: that is to say, the color of the
Repositorie, which in one respect or other he knows to be in the Idea.

Rule 3. After the second Idea of any Repositorie is bestowed in its proper
place, let it be considered, whether by some proper fiction it may have some
fit connection with the former Idea, standing in the same Repositorie, in
respect of the action thereof, in some kind of manner affecting the former. As
for example: imagine that the Idea placed in the first room of the Repositorie,
be an old man sleeping in a chair^ by the fire side; and that the Idea in the
second room o^ the same Repositorie, be a black S^ith or Farriar giving an^
horse a drench: I fayn therefore, that the horse struggling and bounding up with
his fore feet, does awake the old man sitting by the fire in the former room.
And this relation is, as it were, a knitting or chaining of this Idea with the
former: so that if we remember one of them, we cannot lightly be forgetful of
the other. If a fit relation be not presently found, by transferring the action
of the latter unto the former; then let there be fought some other agreement,
which the latter has with the former: either in respect they do both concern
^he same subject, (as when the ^ubiect of them both is concerning war, peace,
justice, ^^^ne, patience etc.) or second^y, in respect they are both Idea's of
the same kind, (as when ^oth of them are direct Idea's, ^oth Relatiues, both
Subditi^iall, both Scriptiles, or both compound Idea's.) And if they agree
neither in the subject, nor in the kind of Idea, then we are to fasten upon
that relation, which they may have in respect of their situation or position,
by considering their position to be like, if it be like; (as when both Idea's
are placed upon the stage, both upon a table, both upon the opposite wall,
etc.) or different if they be of a different situation, (as when one has place
upon the stage, and the other upon the wall:) for even by this consideration,
both Idea's are the better remembered.

Rule 4. When the latter Idea of any Repositorie is bestowed, we must repeat
in our mind (if time will give us leave) all the former Idea's of the other
houses. For as a scholar by often reading over his lesson, gets it without
book: so by often repeating these Idea's in our mind, we shall the better
retain them.

Rule 5. We must take hee^ that we ouercharge not our memory with a multitude
of Idea's: for as it is hurtful to load the stomach with more meat then it
can digest at once; so is it also unprofitable to oppress the memory with too
^eat a multitude of Ideas. Let ^ch observations therefore ^sse as are common
and trial, and let us commit such ^ly to memory, as are indeed ^emorable. The
number of ^ings that may be committed (...) once unto a man's memory (...) this
Art, are six and thirty, which are abundantly suffici^t for the memory to be
char^ed withal at once, and more ^y many peradventure then ^e shall have
occasion at any ^me to use. And so much con^erning the choice of Ideas, and
bestowing them in their ^laces.

CHAP. XIIII. Concerning the practice of the Art of Memory.
IT remains that now at (...) I should illustrate all the f^mer precepts of
this Art by (...) examples, that the use by t^ practice thereof may be t^
better seen. I will therefo^ show the use thereof: first (...) remembering
businesses; ^condly in remembering obse^uations.

First therefore concernin^ businesses. Suppose that a man riding alone toward
a Fay^ kept in some market Town for some especial business^ and that as he is
upon his iou^ney, diverse other business come into his mind there to (...)
done; he must then bestow ^m, and lay them up in order (...) their places by
their Idea's, ^hey come to mind. As for ^mple.

The first business he thinks ^on, is to enquire the price ^seed wheat in the
market. (...) him therefore suppose in (...) first place or room of the (...)
Repositorie, that he sees ^ers men standing together ^h sacks of corn, that
it may ^y some face of a corn mar^; and that on the nearer side the stage, he
sees a country ^n clad in russet, with a pair (...) high shoes on, pouring
^eate out of a sack into a (...) shell, the ears or handles ^ereof are of
pure gold; that (...) this supposition the Idea may have the color of the
^positorie which is gold, attrib^ted unto it; according to t^ rule of the sixth
Chapter.

The second business is (...) procure mowers to cut do^ meadow grass. Let
theref^^ be supposed in the seco^ place of the first Repositorie, or four
husbandly men to (...) whetting their sithes, the bla^ whereof are of gold,
agreeab^ to the color of the Repos^^rie; and that the sound also whetting
their sithes is perfe^ly heard. The relation wh^ this Idea has unto the form^
is in respect of situation: ^^cause both Idea's are pla^ upon the stage of the
first ^^positorie.

The third business is, to ^quire out one whose name (...) Fletcher, dwelling
in that own, and unknown unto ^im. Let him therefore fancy that the first
part of the second Repositorie is turned, as it were, unto a Fletchers shop,
wherein ^he Fletcher stands close to ^is stall, having a great box of silver
arrow heads by him, and that he is busied in heading of ^rrowes. The fiction of
the ar^ow heads to be of silver, ser^eth to attribute the color of the
Repositorie to the Idea.

The fourth business is to ^uy pepper. For the remem^rance of this, the second
place of the second Repositorie, must be supposed to be changed into the form
of a Grocers shop. And that the opposite wall is set forth with a nest of
boxes, whereupon the names of spices are written, according to the common
custom of Grocers shops, and the side wal^ also furnished with Grocery ware:
and that two foot o^ this side the opposite wall^ there is a Counter or a
shew-boord and the Grocer standing upon the further side of it, having a blue
apron before him, is weighing of pepper in a pair^ of balance, the scales
whereo^ are silver, (as is the pillar o^ this Repositorie.) The relation of
this Idea to the former, consists in this, that both are shops: The first
containing things saleable, that are prepared for men's destruction; and this,
such things as whose use serves for men's preservation.

The fifth business is to speak with a Councellor. Let that Councellor then be
imagined to sit in a black gown lined with velvet, in a chair in the midst
of the first place of ^he third Repositorie, and to ^e turning over a book of
some man's case, which he has ^n his hand. Here needs no ^ttribution of
color, since the Counselors gown is black of it self, which is the proper
color of this Repository, whose pillar is of ieat.

The sixth business is to buy (...) yard of black velvet. Wherefore the second
room of the ^hird Repositorie must be trans^ormed, as it were, into a Mer^ers
shop, and upon the shew-boord there must be supposed ^o lie a piece of black
velvet open, the Mercer being on the other side thereof praising an^ commending
it. This Idea has also of it self the color of the Repositorie, as the
former had* and may be referred unto it by this imagination, that velvet (which
is the subject o^ this Idea) is also the facing o^ the Lawyers gown, which
sits in the former room.

But I shall not need to proceed any further in giving examples for remembrance
o^ businesses, since their Idea'^ for the most part are D^rect and such as
nature it self offers to our mind: I will therefore now proceed to give
examples of Observations to b^ remembered, and show how their Idea's are to be
bestowe^ in the Repositories following.

The first Observation.
Diogenes the Cynicke, when entered into Plato's hall, and (...) the table
therein covered ^th a fair carpet, and the cup^^^rd to be furnished with
plate, ^d the rest of his household stuff ^^^ptuous and rich: He plucked (...)
the carpet in a kind of indig^ion, and trampled upon it ^^th his feet, saying;
I spurn Plato's pride. Yea but (an^^^red Plato) with a greater ^^^de.

The Reposition thereof.
The Idea of this Apoph^gme is direct, and not so ^at, but that it may be
con^ned in one of the memorial ^ces, nor so small, but being ^rein placed, it
may be dil^ned by one which stands this side of the stage: therefore I
suppose the Idea to (...) there laid up in equal quantity, according to the
ru^ Chap. 4. by imagining the fi^ place of the fourth Reposito^^ (whose color
is blue) to ha^ both the opposite and side w^ hung with tapistry, and t^^ close
unto the opposite w^^ there stands a cupboord plate; and in the middle of
(...) room a fair table, cover with a carpet of blue silk; a^ an old man
with a long wh^^ beard, sitting in a chair by (...) side wall, as master of
(...) house, apparelled in an A^demicall habit, to repres^ Plato the father of
the Aca^micks. And further, that the comes to the table ano^^ man in a patcht
gown, a^ beggarly apparel, which p^ ^h off the carpet, and tread^^ it under
his feet. Which ^ato beholding, rises out of (...) chair, takes up the
carpet, ^d taxes his rudeness. The ^lour of the carpet is agree^le to the
color of the Repo^orie.

The second Observation.
^aeterea, si nulla fuit generalis origo
^rrarum, and Coeli, semperque aeterna fuere,
^r supra bellum Thebanum, and funera Troja,
^on alias alij quoque res cecinere Poetae. Lucretius.
In English thus: ^oreouer, if there never was of yore,
^eginning of the world; but that it was
Always eternal: wherefore th^^ before
The wars of Thebes and Tr^^ did come to pass,
Did there no Poet write of oth^^ things?


The Reposition thereof.
This is to be expressed by compound Idea, in this manner. Imagine a fair
large tab^ about five or six foot squar^ to hang upon the opposite w^ of the
second room in t^ fourth Repository; whose c^lour being blue, causes the
frame of the table to be so to In the upper part of the tab^ I suppose to be
painted in s^uerall squares, divided ea^ from the other by a down right blue
line 3 inches broa^ the destruction of Thebes, a^^ the destruction of Troy,
which is a night piece: and that in the lower part of the table, those four
verses before mentioned of the Poet Lucretias, are fairly written. In this Idea
the blue line of the partition is to be well marked, because it shows the
picture to consist of several histories. The relation which this Idea has to
the former, is taken from difference of position, that whereas the former Idea
of this Repository has place upon the stage, this is placed upon the opposite
wall.

The third Observation.
Every thing which is just, is not agreeable to equity. For Manlius Torquatus
did justice, but not equity, when he caused his valiant son to be bebeaded;
for that he, contrary to his commandment, being mightily provoked by the
insolence of the enemy, had fought with them in his absence, although he
returned with victory.

The Reposition.
This is to be expressed by a direct Idea standing in the first place of the
fifth Repository, the color of whose pillar is red. I fancy therefore to stand
therein a big man in complete armor, his beauer up, of a dreadful and
astounding countenance, having a plume of red feathers upon his crest, with a
great chain of gold about his neck, (bearing the signification of his name
Torquatus) and resting his right hand upon a red truncheon applied to his side;
he seems earnestly to command some of the soldiers in red coats by him, to
hasten a young man pinioned to execution.

The fourth Observation.
A man in some case may do damage unto his neighbor, though he know it, yet
without injury. For if there be two victualling houses together in a town,
the keeper of the one does damage to the other, in as much as he seeks to
draw the guests to his house: yet is this damage without injury, and
therefore not punishable by any law of the land.

The Reposition.
The Idea of this is also direct in equal quantity. For it is to be supposed,
that in the opposite wall of the second place of the fifth Repositorie, there
is a door opening into a victualling house, adjoining unto the Repositorie, on
the back side, having a red lattice window, and railes before it: and that in
the side wall upon the right hand, there is a door open, leading into another
victualling house, adjoining to the end of the Repositorie, having a red
lattice also before the window. Further, let there be imagined some common
drunkard to sit upon a bench on this side the further Alehouse, with a kan of
ale in his hand; who looking into the former room, and seeing Manlius his
son ready to be carried away to execution, points to his kan, and seems to
utter these words to Manlius his son, as he sees him to pass along by him:
Oh this were good for thee now, if thou might sit by it. For such like idle
conceits as this, will make a matter the better to stick in mind.

The fifth Observation.
There is no excellent wit, without some madness.

The Reposition.
The Idea hereof is Relative, committed to memory, by supposing well known, to
be in the first place of the sixth Repositorie, who through too much intension
of mind upon his studies, is fallen into a deep frenzy; and that he having a
great yellow feather in his hat, rides up and down the stage upon an
hobbyhorse.

The sixth Observation.
Ilia, called also Rhea, being great with child by Mars, had at a birth two
children, Romus and Remus; whom she delivered to a notable harlot, called Lupa,
to be by her nurced and brought up: of whom all brothel-houses were after
called in Latin, Lupanaria: (as the English word Harlot, was first derived
from Arletta, concubine of Robert Duke of Normandy, father of William the
Conqueror.) Hence grew that fable, that these twinne-borne brethren weee nurced
by a she wolf, because Lupa in Latin signifies a she wolf. Romus after
being King, gave name to Rome: but was called by the people, in a kind of
flattery, by the diminutiue of his name, Romulus.

The Reposition.
This is to be laid up by a Direct Idea, supposing that in the second place of
the sixth Repositorie, there lies upon a pad of straw a she wolf, having about
her neck a yellow collar, with two infants sucking of her. And that the wolf
setting out her throat, howleth so deernly, that the frantic man in the
former room stops his dancing to look at her.

The seventh Observation.
Milo of Croton, a famous wrestler, who was the first crowned at Olympia, when
being old be traveled along through the woodland countries of Italy, espied
an oak near the way side, rifted in the midst. Then intending (as I think)
to try, whether as yet there remained any strength in his arms, thrusting his
hands into the rift of the tree, he rent it down a little way: but the oak
being thus bowed, and drawn into two parts, closed again upon his hands, as
he was still tugging thereat, and held him there fast, to become a prey to the
wild beasts.

Aul. Gellius Attic. Noct. 15. 16. The Reposition.
The Idea of this observation is a Direct Idea, and must be placed in the first
room of the seventh Repositorie, the color whereof is green. I suppose
therefore a young oak with green leaves: and acornes upon it, to grow up out
of the middle of the stage, being rifted in the midst: and that a big man,
broad shouldered, and apparelled like a Champion, after the ancient guize,
with a garland of green law^ell upon his head, has both his hands in such
manner enclosed in the oak, who casting back his head and body, cries aloud
for help; so that me thinks, I see not only the bowing back of his body, and
his striving to get loose, but even to hear with mine ears the outcrie which
he makes.

The eight observation.
To drive forward the night with old wives fables.

The Reposition.
This Phrase may be committed to mind by a Direct Idea, in this manner. Let
there be supposed in the opposit^ wall a chimney, with a goo^ fire in it, about
which some half a dozen women sit: among the rest, one being (...) very old
woman, and yet cla^ in green (the color of the house) (like an ape in purple^
tells a tale to the rest, liftin^ up her hands as she speaket^ with such
ridiculous and anticke gesture and action, as be sits a beldame gossip:
where upon the whole quire of the gossips burst out into low^ laughing, and
holding their hips, with laughter and coughing, make such a confuse^ noise,
that the cry of Milo i^ the former room cannot b^ heard. And hence is derived
the relation which this Idea has unto the former, because they ^re both of
them loud soun^ing Idea's: though the first ^^und be a lamentable outcry; and
the latter, a sound of mirth and joy.

The ninth Observation.
Men are certainly more anci^^t then the gods of the heathen: because men were
the makers of them.

The Reposition.
This is expressible by a Di^ect Idea; by fancying a statua^ie in a purple
wastcoate, to be ^n the first place of the eight Repositorie (whose color is
^urple) fashioning a marble ^mage.

The tenth Observation.
The snow falling whole, and not melting as it falls, is always of a
six-angled figure; setting forth unto us the wondrous worl^ of the Creator.

The Reposition.
The Idea of this observation is direct, but in an augmente^ quantity. For
since one flak^ of snow is so small, that being bestowed in a memorial plac^
it cannot be seen of him tha^ stands on this side the Repositorie: therefore
a great heap^ of snow is to be placed in the midst of the stage of the secon^
room of the eight Repositorie whose color being purple, admonishes that some
part o^ the Idea must be purple: an^ therefore I suppose a purpl^ pendant to be
stuck in the heap of snow. The relation of this Idea to the former, i^ in
respect of the subject. For each of them has great show of Art, though this
being the work of God, be ten thousand times more admirable then the other,
which is but the work of man's hands.

The eleventh Observation.
There are three most beautiful mothers of three most deformed daughters:
Familiarity, which brings forth Contempt; Truth which brings forth
Hatred; and Peace, which brings forth Sloth.

The Reposition.
I lay it up by a direct or right Idea in the first place of the ninth
Repository, (whose color is white) after this manner. I suppose three most
beautiful women, ^lad in white satin, with chapplets of white Roses upon
their heads, sitting upon three low stools, and giving suck to their three
daughters, which to look upon, are most foul and hard favored.

The twelfth Observation.
Astrologia Iudiciaria est negotiocissima vanitas.

Basil. that is, Judicial Astrology is a most busy vanity.

The Reposition.
The Idea hereof is Relative. For it is exemplified by the history of Thales
the Philosopher; who taking the altitude of a star with his Quadrant in the
night season, taking little heed unto his footing, fell in^o a ditch; and was
well laughed at by a woman then seeing him; and obiecting unto him his folly,
that was so curious in looking after things above, that he minded not the ditch
before him. This is to be expressed in an action upon the second part of the
stage belonging to the ninth Repository; whose color being white, I suppose
his Quadrant to be covered with white paper pasted upon it. Also, that there
may be a connection of this Idea with the former, I conceit it, that the woman
runs to the other three women in the former room, to show them of Thales
his fall.

The thirteenth Observation.
Whosoever deuoureth that which is consecrate to the worship of God, brings
destruction to his own family.

Prou. 20.25. But whosoever that seizes into his hands any part of the glebe
belonging to the Minister, and leaves it to his posterity, he deuoureth that
which is consecrated unto God.

Ezech. 45.4. Therefore whosoever seizes any part of the glebe belonging to
the Minister, and leaves it to his posterity, he brings destruction to his
own family.


The Reposition.
This Syllogism is to be bestowed by a compound Idea in the first place of the
tenth Repositorie, (both the pillars whereof are supposed to be of gold,
according to the last rule ^f the first Chapter.) First ther^ore I suppose this
Syllogism ^o be fairly written in a white ^able, four foot square, whose
^order is gilded, and distin^uished into the several parts ^hereof by several
sections, that is to say, into the Propo^^tion, Assumption and Con^lusion; and
that the table is ^ung up, upon the opposite (...) all in the first room. I
sup^ose further, that underneath his table, close to the opposite (...) all,
there sits in a chair of ^old, some sacrilegious and ^orrupt patron, fast
asleep; whom death coming unto, ^auing a crown of gold upon ^is head, to
signify his mo^archie, strikes with his dart, ^^d awakeneth him, showing him
the writing over his hea^ that he may consider it and r^pent, and make a timely
rest^tution unto the Church, le^ he damn his own soul, an^ bring destruction
upon his family.

The fourteenth Observation.
Anger is a short madness.

The Reposition.
The Idea of this sentence (...) Relatine. For it may fitly (...) expressed by
the history (...) Saul, 1 Samuel 20.33. who being enraged with anger, threw (...)
iauelin at his son and hei^ Jonathan to kill him. Therfo^ I suppose a man of
extraord^nary height, apparelled with (...) royal robe of state, hauin^ (...)
crown of pure gold upon his head, and holding a Iauelin ^n his hand, to ^it
upon a princely throne; and that he ^epresenting Saul, upon the ^udden starteth
up, and casts it ^t a young man, standing before ^im in the same room,
appa^elled as befitteth a Prince. ^here needs no attribution ^f the color of
the Repositorie (...) this Idea, because Saul's ^owne being of gold, is agreeble
to the proper color of the ^nth Reposi-torie. Also death (...) the former
place has a (...) own of gold, as Saul also ^th in this, and thereby both
^ea^s are conjoined.

The fifteenth Observation.
Magnus Aristoteles, trutinando cacumina rerum,
In duo diuisit, quicquid in ^rb^ fuit.
In English thus: Great Aristotle weighing well in mind,
The essence of this universe; did find,
That two things only were in i^ combined.
that is, Substances and Accidents.

The Reposition.
This is to be expressed by (...) compound Idea, faining a tab^^ to hang upon
the opposite wa^ four foot square, the bord^^ whereof is silver, (so suppose^
because it is placed in the eleventh Repositorie, both who pillars are of
silver.) And the in the upper part of this tabl^ are drawn two great paralle^
circles (being the Stenogr^phical Character of the world) in the midst whereof
is the figure of two: and that underneath it is drawn a line, and beneath the
line, that distichon written.

The sixteenth Observation.
Dic vbi tunc esset, cum praeter eum nihil esset?
Tunc vbi nunc in se: quoniam sibi sufficit ipse.
In English thus: Say, where was God, when save himself, no kind of thing had
being?
There, where he is, still in himself, and so for ever: seeing
Himself alone unto himself is all sufficient.


The Reposition.
This likewise is to be expressed by a compound Idea: faining a table to hang
upon the wall of the second place of the eleventh Repositorie, of the same
bigness with the former, and in like manner bordered with a silver frame. And
that in the upper part thereof is written in great Hebrew letters, the name of
God Jehovah, and nothing else; because the subject of this Idea is Gods being,
when nothing else was; with a line drawn under it, and those two verses
beneath the line. Both Idea's of this Repositorie are the same in kind, that is
to say, both Compound, and by this relation fitly joined one with an other.

The seventeenth Observation.
Damascus in the time of the Prophet Isai, was the chief city of Syria, as
appears, Isai. 7.8. In the time of our Savior Christ and long after,
Antiochia was the ^ead city; but now Aleppo is the ^hiefest city of Syria.

The Reposition.
This is to be expressed by a ^irect Idea, in a contracted ^orme. For since the
Province ^f Syria (which is the subject ^f this sentence) is so great, that a
direct Idea thereof can ^ot be contained in a memo^iall place in full
quantity, therefore I suppose the oppo^^te wall of the first place of the
^welfth Repositories, to have a ^^^ge piece of Landtschape in ^^ely colors
painted there^pon: wherein are contained in a far distance one from an other,
three goodly cities, over which the several names of Damascus, Antiochia and
Aleppo, are written in several co^partements limited by black lines very big,
because black is the color of this Repositorie.

But it is not necessary that I should proceed any further, in giving more
examples, because by that which has already bin delivered, it is evident
enough with what Idea every thing memorable is to be expressed, and in what
place to be bestowed. And now, if you shall try with your self, whether you
can repeat over al^ the Idea's in their order, without sight of the book,
tha^ are contained in this Chapter so that you thoroughly well understand what
you have read; I doubt not but you will freely confess, that there is great
certainty in this Art.

CHAP. XV. Of the Anomaly of Reposition.
THere is but one Anomaly or irregularitie in laying up Idea's: that is to say,
when in stead of a fained Repository; a true place really seen with our eyes
is used, This Anomaly is admitted upon two occasions offered.

First, when the thing it self is bestowed really in some place, to be, as it
were, the memorial Idea of it self. As if a scholar sitting in his stody,
lights upon a book, one of whose sheets is sown out of order, and purposes
to have it that day mended; let him lay it down then at the door of his
study, that when he goes forth, he may by the sight thereof be put in mind to
take it with him, and so to put it forth to mending.

Secondly, when presently after we have laid up the Idea in our mind, we must
put it out again. As for example: if a man be talking with a rich man, and
whiles he is in speech with him, it comes into his mind, to speak unto him
in the behalf of a poor neighbor of his, the rich man's tenant: let him then
suppose that neighbor of his to be there present, standing or sitting in some
place, which his eye has designed, and that he stands there still in sight,
till he be entered into talk concerning him. Or, if again before he part from
him, it comes into his mind to buy wood of him; and that because they are yet
still in sad talk upon other matters, time serves him not to speak of it;
let him then imagine himself to see a small stacke or pile of wood, in some
certain place which he designeth with his eyes, and keep still in mind what
Idea he has there placed, that he may speak of it when he sees his time.

CHAP. XVI. Of Deposition.
HItherunto I have spoken only of the first part of the Art of Memory, called
Reposition: it remains to speak somewhat concerning the second part, called
Deposition.

Deposition is, whereby things before committed to memory, are called to mind
again, and either committed to writing, or otherwise dispatched, that so it
may be put out of our mind: and the memorial places after such deposition of
the Idea's being left empty, may be the fitter to receive new Idea's into them.

This deposition or putting things out of mind, must be undertaken as soon as
conveniently we can; that the mind may not be charged with the burden of them
longer then needs must; and that we may the sooner call them to mind, seeing
they were but a little before laid up in our remembrance. But if it falls
out, that when we go about to call to mind any thing that was before committed
to memory, the Idea thereof being more negligently laid up, appears not; then
we must assay to call it to mind, by following this course.

First, it is known for certainty, that every Idea which lies hid, has in
some part the color of the Repositorie attributed unto it; we must therefore
first enquire, in what manner the color of the Repositorie was ascribed unto
it. For by this very consideration commonly all Idea's that are obscure, are
brought forth to light.

Secondly, if the Idea will not by this means be called to mind, then next we
must try, whether we can bring it into remembrance, by the relation which it
had unto the other Idea placed in the same Repositorie, in respect of the
quantity, situation, subject, kind, or of the action of the latter Idea
transferred unto the former. For one Idea of the Repositorie being certainly
known, will not suffer the other to lie hidden, but by the mutual relation of
them one to another (whereby they are as it were chained together) it shall be
compelled to come forth, except the Reposition has been too slothful.

Thirdly, if neither by this means, we can bring the Idea to remembrance, we
must bethink us of what kind it was, (that is, whether it were a direct Idea,
a Relative, Subdititiall, or compound Idea,) or in what quantity it was laid
up, (that is, in an equal, augmented, or contracted quantity,) or what
position or situation it had, (that is, whether it was placed upon the wall,
upon a table, upon a cupboord or shelfe, upon the stage, or underneath it:) or
lastly, whether it had any motion or sound ascribed unto it. For by such
questions the Idea is often found out.

Fourthly, if we know, that the Idea which we seek, was indeed a Scriptile
Idea; but what the writing it self was, we have forgotten: then we must search
it out, by bethinking us of the bigness of the table, whether it were one
foot and an half broad, for three foot broad, or of a bigger size, that
hereby we may know, whether it were the Idea of a single word, Quotation,
Phrase, short Sentence or long. If it be found to be a long sentence, then we
are to examine the fashion and manner of writing it; that so we may come to
know, what kind of sentence it was that we seek for; as that it was a
Distribution, a Syllogism, the ^nswer of some objection, a ^imilitude, or
other kind of ^entence, distinguishable by ^he parts thereof. Now if by ^his
means we find what kind of Scriptile Idea that was which now lies hid, as
that ^t was a Quotation, short sen^ence, Syllogism, similitude, etc. but yet
we know not in particular any word thereof; ^hen we must seek out the ^hiefe
word of the Idea, by ^alling to mind, if we can, ^he first letter thereof;
which ^s to be found out by repea^ing the Alphabet in order, and well expending
and considering what letter ou^ mind will fasten upon. For it will certainly
fasten upon the right letter, if a blameable reposition has not gone before.
Now when we have found out the first letter, then we must apply the other
letters of the Alphabet that will follow that better thereunto, to find what is
the second letter; and when we have the two first letters, it is an easy
matter by the length of the word, the transcendencies therein, and the two
first letters, to find out the whole first word, and thereby to come to the
knowledge of the sentence.

To conclude, if by none of these means you can find out the Idea which you
seek for, let it pass, and trouble not your self any further about the
search of it. For if you read or hear the same word spoken by any the same
day, or the next day after, it is very likely that the whole sentence will come
then to memory. For as a book, which a man has negligently bestowed in his
study, is not peradventure found when he ^eeketh it, though he remove ^he most
of his books in his ^tudie; when notwithstanding ^fterwards, taking forth the
^ooke next it, he finds that ^lso which before was missing: ^o sometimes it
comes to ^asse, that a sentence which ^ath been carelessly commit^ed to
memory, cannot be ^ound when it is sought for; which notwithstanding when ^e
notion lying next unto it in the storehouse of the ^emorie is called forth,
it self also will come to mind therewith.

FINIS.
