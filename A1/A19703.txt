ANNO 1640.

Matt. Chap. 10. verse. 16. Be- Wijse-as-Serpents Innocent-as-Doues



Psalm 20. Verse. 1. 5.

The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the Name of Iaakobs God defend
thee, etc. that We may rejoice in thy salvation and set up the Banner in the
Name of our God etc.

Psalm 60. Verse. 4.

Thou (O God) have given a Banner to them that fear thee, that it may be
displayed because of thy Truth.

The Preface.
SInce never Man at any time could so wisely frame his Work or compose his
Wryttings but (it coming to the Public view) either Ignorance or Envy (if not
both) Mortal Ennemies to Virtue did always labor to Under-Myne the Sincerity
of the Author, seeking (with the pricking SPider) to draw their Venem out of
the best Herbs and sweetest smelling Flowers? I Considering this, darre
promese no Securite to My self (tho a continual Amator yet no daily Practiser)
being but a new graffed Impe in comparison of those innumerable flourissing
famous (and yet nevertheless controlled) Poets, Notwith standing (being moved
with a entire Affection toward al those that from their Hearts wish, Labor
for, and Aim at, the Peace of Syon) I have enterprysed and, by the Grace of
God, finished and perfyted, My first Fruit, Intitulate Thrissels Banner? And
knowing that the same shall rencounter, and come to, the Hands and Eyes, both of
Friends and Foes, which I al include in three Ranks, the First, Wise and
Understanding (only Absolute Friends) the Second, Ignorants (both Frieuds and
Foes) the Third Malicious Partial Calumniators (only Absolute Foes) Therefore I
have thought it most Necessary and Expedient (for Preventing and Eschewing, so
far as possibly I can, al false Glosses of Adversaries) to Accompany and
Convoye the foresaid Banner, with this My own Explication, where in I have (so
Briefly and plainly as I could) faithfully Declared My Meaning and Intention in
every thing, as well anent the Form of it, as concerning the Matter and words
therein contained; which I Hope shall tend, To, the Comfort and Edification of
the First. Instruction of the Second, Conviction and Disclosing of the Third,
and in All and Every one of them, to the Glory of God, whom I earnestly beseech
to Maintain His own Cause, to Strenthen Encouradge and Assist the Defenders
thereof, to Open the Eyes of such as yet are Blinded, to Arm al those that
suffer Persecution for His sake, with Wisdom and Christian Patience, granting
them, that passing Natural understanding, Peace of Conscience. Here in this
Life, and in His own good Time Everlasting.

Repos Ailleurs.
Explication of the Form and Fashion of Thrissels Banner.
The Book.
Signifies The Bible and consequently Ios. 1, 8. Psalm. 119 105, ^72 Psalm. 19.
7, etc. Isai. 20, 8. Isai 66, 25. Luk 8, 21. Ioh 5, 24. 38. Heb 4, 12. 1. Ioh
2, 5.
the Word of God, which ought to be the Foundation and Ground of our Attempts,
as being the only Infallible Rule whereby all the Imaginations, Thoughts, Words,
Resolutions and actions of Man should be Squared.

The Sword.
Signifies Romans 13, 4.
Authority, and the standing of it upon the Bible, Signifies that Rom 1^, 1.

Thrissel and Sword each one to other, Signifies the Mutual Band betwixt King
and Subjects, Item the Thrissel Decoring the Sword Signifies that Prove. 14, 28.
the Honor of a King stands in his Subjects, Item the Sword carrying up the
Thrissel and so the Thrissel Resting, and (as it were) Growing upon the Sword,
Signifies, as Romans 13, 1^.
Kings ought to Maintain and Defend their Subjects, being (under God) a Rest
and Refuge unto them, so Romans ^3, 1 ^ 1. Pet 2, 7.
Subjects are Bund and Obliged to give due Respect and Honor to their King and
to Obey their Superiors in all things Act. 4, 19.
Agreeing with the Law and Commandment of God,

Gardes thereof) in and fast to the Sheath, and so going upward throug the fyve
Rings, with wouppings about the Sheath fastening the Sword to the Banner,
Signifies that of al Estats, that is the most Happy, which (next unto the Isai

Number. 6, 26. Psalm. 29, 11. Psalm. 147, 14. Luc. 2, 14. 2. These 3, 6.
Peace Especially within it Self when King and Subjects of al Ranks, are (as it
were) wrapped together in Psalm. 133, 1.
Unity Peace and Brotherly Love, Item the two Loufe-hinging-Ends of the
Garter, Signifye that al ready some Knots of Peace are Loused, And as there is
only resting one Knot about the Gardes and another about the Thrissel, so Peace
betwixt King and Subjects is in a weak Estate, and be al ontward appearance
(except The Lord of Peace Prevent it) very near at ane End, Item as the Sword
can not be Drawn, unles, that one (get resting, fast) Knot about the Gardes be
either Loused, or Broken, and that being done, the Garter shall Hing wholely
Lousse, and not be able to bear up, or Keep fast, neither Banner nor Thrissel,
So if the King Enter again in War like manner against his Subjects, and so
(as it were) shaking them of, Rejecting their Earnest and Lawful Petitions
They (finding them selfs altogether cast Lousse and Justice Denied to them)
shall be forced, and must Resolve, to take them to another Course, and to use al
Possible, Lawful and Readiest Means for the Safety and Defense of Themselfs,
Religion and Liberties.

The Banner.

50. 6.
From and Into, the Edge or Border of the Banner, Signifye, that (according to
the Old Proverb Omne Malum ab Ecclesia)

Ordinarily in all Ages the greatest Troubles were (as yet they are) Bred and
Occasioned by such as carry the Name and Show of Gods Messengers, but whosoever
will but, with sound Judgment, call to Mind bygone Examples, with open Eyes,
behold present Experience, and with patient Hearts wait upon the Lords due
time, shall certainly Learn, clearly See, and surely find, that God ever has
Job, 5, 12, 13 Psalm. 31, 23, Psalm 119, 21, Prove. 15, 25, Isai, 2, 12, Luc. 1,

Overthrow the wicked in their own Interpryses, and finally shall make the

34, 50 31
Deeply they are Sworn, and firmly Bund and Obliged (Coniunctly and
unseparably) to Maintain, Defend, and Cleave fast, unto, the True Reformed
Religion, to their Lyfes End, Item as the Lousing of the Garter may well
Separate the Sword from the Rings but can not Separate the Rings from the
Banner, So the Breach of Peace may well make a Separation betwixt King and
Subjects but Rom, S, 35. 38, Psalm, 119, 33, etc.
shall never be able to make any Separation betwixt the Sincere Covenanters and
True Religion.

The Streamer.
Signifies Psalm. 74, 22, 22

Thrissel) Signifies Ezekiel, 20, 37.

Knitt to the Good Cause.

Explication of the Matter Expressed in Thrissels Banner.
The Title.
As al Right and True-Mynded Authors ever Study and Indevore to Intitulate
their Labors and Wryttings, So, that, the Spectator at the first View, and the
Render in one Word, may take up and Conceive the whole Matter, together with
the Author his Sh^pe and Intention, So I (according to my simple Iudcement)
have thought Thrissels Banner the fittest Title for that Work, the whole
Matter therein contained, Belonging properly to the present Estate of Scotland
and Inhabitants thereof.

Liberum Hilarem.
Standing within the Body of the Thrissel, Signifies that Levi. 25, 100 Isai.
