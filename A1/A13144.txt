An excellent Ballad Entitled, The Constancy of Susanna.
To an excellent new tune.


THere dwelt a man in Babylon,
of reputation great by fame:
He took to wife a fair woman,
Susanna she was called by name,
A woman fair and virtuous,
Lady, Lady,
Why should we not of her learn thus
to live godly?
Uertuously her life she led,
she feared God, she stood in awe,
As in the story we have read,
was well brought up in Moses Law.
Her parents they were godly folk,
Lady, Lady,
Why should we not then sing and talk
of this Lady.
That year two Indges there was made
which were the Elders of Babylon,
To Ioachims house was all their trade,
who was Susannaes husband then,
Ioachim was a great rich man,
Lady, Lady,
These Elders often to his house cam^
for this Lady.
Ioachim had an Orchard by,
fast joining to his house or place,
Whereas Susanna commonly
her self did daily there solace,
And that these Elders soon espied,
Lady, Lady,
And privily themselves did hide
for that Lady.
Her chaste and constant life was tried,
by these two Elders of Babylon,
A time convenient they espide,
to have this Lady all alone,
In his O^chard it came to pass,
Lady, Lady.
Where she alone her self did wash
her fair body.
These Elders came to her anon,
and thus they said, fair dame God speed,
Thy doors are fast, thy Maids are gone,
consent to us, and do this deed:
For we are men of no mistrust,
Lady, Lady,
And yet to thee we have a lust,
O fair Lady.
If that to us thou do say nay,
a testimonial we will bring,
We will say that one with thee lay,
how can thou then avoid the thing*
Therefore consent and to us turn,
Lady, Lady,
For we to thee in lust do burn,
O fair Lady.
Then did she sigh, and said alas,
now woe is me on every ^^de,
Was ever wretch in such a case?
shall I consent and do this deed?
Whether I do or do it not,
Lady, Lady,
It is my death right well I wot,
O true Lady.
Better if were for me to fall
into your hands this day guiltless,
Then that I should consent at all,
to this your shameful wickedness,
And even with that (whereas she stood)
Lady, Lady,
Unto the Lord she cried aloud
pitifully.
These Elders both likewise again,
against Susanna aloud they cried,
Their filthy lust could not obtain,
their wickedness, they sought to hide
Unto her friends they then her brought
Lady, Lady,
And with all speed the life they sought
of that Lady.
The second part.
To the same tune.


ON the morrow she was brought forth
before the people there to stand,
That they might hear and know the truth
how these two Elders Susanna found,
The Elders swore and thus did say,
Lady, Lady,
How that they saw a young man lay
with that Lady.
Judgment there was, for no offense,
Susanna causeless then must dye,
These Elders bore such evidence,
against her they did verify,
Who were belieu'd then indeed,
Lady, Lady,
Against Susanna to proceed,
that she should dye.
Susannaes friends that stood her by,
they did lament, and were full woe,
When as they saw no remedy,
but that to death she then must go,
Lady, Lady,
In God was all her hope and trust,
to him did cry.
The Lord her voice heard and beheld,
the Daughters cry of Israel,
His spirit he raised in a child,
whose name was called young Daniel,
Who cried aloud whereas he stood,
Lady, Lady,
I am clear of the guiltless blood
of this Lady.
Are you such fools quoth Daniel then?
in judgment you have not done well,
Nor yet the right way have you gone,
to judge a daughter of Israel,
By this witness of false disdain,
Lady, Lady,
Wherefore to judgment turn again^
for that Lady.
And when to judgment they were set,
he called for those wicked men:
And soon he did them s^parate,
butting the one from the other, then,
He asked the first where he did see
that fair Lady,
He said under a Mulberry tree,
who lied falsely.
Thou lie said Daniel, on thy head,
thy sentence is before the Lord,
He had that forth he might be led.
and bring the other that bore record*
To see how they two did agree
for this Lady,
He said under a Pomgrannat tree,
who lied falsely.
Said Daniel as he did before,
behold the messenger of the Lord
Stand waiting for you at the door,
even to cut thee with a sword.
And even with that the multitude;
aloud did cry,
Give thanks to God, so to conclude
for this Lady.
They dealt like with these wicked men
according as the Scripture says,
They did as with their neighbor then,
by Moses law were put to death,
Tha innocent preserved was,
Lady, Lady,
As God by Daniel brought to pass,
for this Lady.
