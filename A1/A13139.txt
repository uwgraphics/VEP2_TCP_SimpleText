THE SVMME OF CHRISTIANITY, SET DOWN IN FAMIliar questions and answers.
Question. THere have been always, are, and will be in the world, such as
deny the Lord that made the^: tell me therefore first of all, are you
persuaded 2. Pet. 3. 3.
there is a God?

Answer. I am undoubtedly assured hereof: first by that inward light of
understanding whereby he raises testimony unto him self in the hearts of
Romans 1. 19.
men. Secondly by his works of creation, wherein Romans 1. 20.
he has made his power and godhead visible. Thirdly by the works of his
providence, whereby he evidently sustaineth and governs all things. Fourthly
Act. 14. 17. and 17. 24.
by his word, wherein he has most clearly manifested him self unto us. And
therefore I detest from my heart, all atheism and atheists.

Q. What is God?

A. God is a spirit, eternal, infinite, almighty, Ioh. 4. 24.
only wise, most just, and most merciful.

Q. Is there any more but one only God?

godhead there are three distinct persons, the Father, the Son, and the holy
Mat. 28. 19
Ghost.

A. The third person in the Deity, proceeding from the Father and the Son.

Q. Did not God create man perfect in nature, and happy in state? Ge. 1. 26. 28


A. Most perfect and most happy. But by Satan's persuasion man fell from that
perfection, and by his Genesis 3. 2.
fall both lost his first happiness, and threw himself and his into extreme
misery.

Q. Are we then all miserable?

A. All, not one excepted: and that by sin.

Q. What is sin?

A. Sin is offense against God.

Q. Are all men sinners?

A. All have sinned, and have failed of the glory Romans 3. ^3.

Q. How may we be convicted of sin?

A. First by the testimony of our own consciences: and then by the testimony
of God himself, who is greater then our consciences. 1. Ioh. 5. 20.


Q. What is the testimony of conscience?

A. That light of nature, whereby every one discerning between good and evil,
is accused of offense against God. Romans 2. 15.


Q. How does God testify that we be sinners?

A. By his judgments, as well general as partiticular, and by his word.

Q. What are his general judgments?

A His curse upon all creatures for sin, and Genesis 3. 17. Genesis 6.
the destruction of the world by the flood.

Q. What are his particular judgments?

A. Such as the punishment of Cain, and the destruction Genesis 4. 11. Genesis 19. 24
of Sodom and Gomorrha.

Q. What does God testify against us in his word?

A. That we be sinners three manner of ways First by the sin of Adam, in whom
all have sinned. Romans 5. 12.


Qu. How secondly?

A. In that we are all borne in sin, and conceived in iniquity; and thereby
the children of wrath. Psalm. 51. 7. Ephesians. 2. 3.


Qu. How thirdly?

A. By our own personal transgressions, in leaving undone that which is good,
and committing that which is evil, in thought, word, and deed: which we may
best discern by the Law of God given to Romans 3. ^0.
that end.

Q. How may we affect and pierce our selves herewith? Act. 2. 37.


A. If we consider the greatness, lothsomnesse, and multitude of our sins,
with the punishments due unto them.

Qu. How may this be done?

A. The greatness of our sins we may esteem by the greatness of him against
whom they are committed; 1. Sam. 2. 25
and the lothsomnesse, by that most perfect holiness which is in God,
expressed in his Law.

Qu. What is the multitude of our sins?

A. David said, his sins were more then the hairs of his head; and who
knows how often he Psalm. 4. 13. Psalm. 19. 13
offends?

Qu. What are the punishments of sin?

A. The temporal punishments of sin are all the calamities and afflictions
of this life, all diseases of the body, and griefs of mind; and finally death
Romans 5. 12.
it self.

Qu. Are there also eternal punishments?

A. Yea. The loss of everlasting happiness: and everlasting destruction both
of body and soul. Romans 6. 29.


Qu. Is not then our misery exceeding great?

A. Greater then either tongue can speak, or can enter into the heart of man. 1.
Cor. 2. 9.


II.
Qu. Is there any help against this misery?

^. None in our selves, nor in any creature, but 1. Ioh. 2. 2.
only in Christ Jesus, who is made unto us from God w^sdom, righteousness,
sanctification and redemption, that who so glories might glory in him. 1.
Cor. 1. 30.


Q. How is he made our wisdom?

A. In that being from before all eternity the son of God, in the fullness
of time he became Ioh. 1. 13.
man, and both out of the bosom of the Father revealed Ioh. 1. 18.
unto us all things necessary for us to know unto salvation, and is he in whom
all the promises of God are yea and Amen. 2. Cor. 1. 20.


Q. How is he made our righteousness?

A. In that knowing no sin, he became sin for us, that we by him might be
made the righteousness 2. Cor. 5. 21.
of God.

Qu. Declare this yet more fully.

A. He bare the curse of the Law and punishment of our sins, to satisfy the
justice of God: and fulfilled Gal. 3. 13. Esa. 53. 5. To. 5. 18. 19
the righteousness of the Law, to obtain for us the blessing thereof, which
is eternal life.

Q. How is he made our sanctification?

A. In that he sanctified him self for us; and does Ioh. 17. 19. and 17.
also sanctify us in our selves by his spirit.

Q. How is he yet our redemption?

A. To deliver us finally from all our enemies, and Phil. 3. 20. 1. Cor. 15. 25
bring us into the kingdom of heaven. In the mean time he sits at the
right hand of God an advocate and intercessor for us, to make both us and our
Romans 8. 34.
services acceptable unto God.

III.
Qu. Salvation then being wholly and only in Christ, how may we attain
thereunto?

A. If we believe in him. Ioh. 3 16.


Qu. What is it to believe in Christ?

A. Not only to know that salvation is by him alone, but also our selves to put
our whole trust and Ioh. 3. 36.
confidence in him, and to assure our selves of the forgiveness of our sins
by his death and sacrifice, and of everlasting life by his obedience. Romans 5.
18.


Qu. Does this faith only justify us before God?

A. Only. Yet not for the worthiness of it self, but for the worthiness of
him in whom we believe Romans 3. 28.


Q. Is this faith in our own power?

A. No. It is the gift of God unto his children. Ephesians. 2. 8.


Q. What is the sum of our Christian belief?

A. That which is expressed in the Creed of the Apostles. I believe in God the
Father almighty, etc.

Q. How does God give this gift of faith?

A. It is the work of his spirit in our hearts, sometimes Gal. 1. 16. Romans 10.
14.
immediately by instinct, but ordinarily by the preaching of the word.

Q. What is the word of God?

A. Generally the holy Scriptures contained in the canonical books of the
old and new Testament, written by the Prophets and Apostles, but here Ephesians.
2. 20.
particularly the doctrine of the grace of God unto salvation by faith in
Christ Jesus. 1. P^t. 1. 25.


Q. What is the authority and use of the holy Scriptures in Gods Church?

A. They are (says the Apostle) inspired from God, and profitable to teach, to
confute, to reprove, 2. Tim. 3. 16
to instruct, and finally to make the man of God perfect unto every good work.

Qu. How is it then that some say, the word of God is imperfect, doubtful, and
obscure?

A. These are in deed the blasphemies of Antichrist: Psalm. 19. 7. Psalm. 119.
105. Prou. 8. 9.
but God him self witnesses of his word, that it is perf^ct, plain, and
lightsome.

Qu. But you say, the holy Ghost works faith by the preaching of the Gospel.

A. So it is: for God who commanded light to shine out of darkness is he that
shines in the hearts 2. Cor. 4. 6.
of his servants, that they might give fotth the light of the glory of God, in
the face of Jesus Christ.

Qu. What is this ministry of preaching?

A. That ordinance of Christ whereby he is propounded and offered unto
salvation, committed Ioh. 3. 14. 2. Cor. 5. 18.
unto those whom he has called.

Qu. What is the use and fruit of this ministry?

A. Being the power and wisdom of God unto salvation, first the word is
thereby made the incorruptible seed of a new birth, to beget us again unto 1.
Pet. 1. 23
God.

Qu. What else?

A. It is afterward that sincere milk whereby as newborn babes we do grow
up unto the Lord. 1. Tet. 2. 2.


Q. Proceed.

A. It is finally that strong meat whereby we are fed continually unto
everlasting life, and that preservative whereby we are kept from every blast
of 1. Cor. 3 2. Ephesians. 4. 14.
vain doctrine.

Q. What is that of the keys of the kingdom of Mat. 16. 19
heaven, and the power of binding and loosing?

A. It is that authority that Christ has given unto his ministers, exercised
publikly both in preaching Mat. 18. 18
the promises and judgments of God, and in the administration of the censures
of the Church. 1. Cor. 5. 5.


Q Is there any private use hereof?

A. Very great and necessary, in comforting of Luc. 7. 48. Act. 8. 20. and
13. 10.
afflicted consciences, and in terrifying the obstinate offenders.

Q. What other means has God given unto his Church, for confirmation and
increase of faith?

A. He has for relief of our infirmities added unto the preaching of the
word, the administration Act. 2. 38.
of his holy Sacraments.

Qu. What is a Sacrament?

A. A Sacrament is an holy sign and seal ordained of God, to continue,
confirm, and increase Romans 4. 11.
our faith in Christ. We do also thereby profess and and vow to be his
servants.

Q. How is it a sign?

A. In that it visibly represents and expresses unto us that of Christ, and
our salvation by him, Luc. 22. 19. 1. Cor. 11. 26
which we are taught by the word preached, and therefore is not unfitly called,
a visible word.

Q. How is a Sacrament a seal?

A. In that it is annexed of God as a seal unto his covenant of grace, to
assure us of the truth, and Romans 4. 11.
effect thereof.

Q. How many Sacrameets be there?

A. Two. Baptism and the Supper of the Lord. Mat. 28. Mat. 26.


Q. What is Baptism?

A. A Sacrament wherein we are baptized with water into the name of the Father,
the Son, and 1. Ioh. 1. 7. 1. Pet. 1. 2.
the holy Ghost, to teach and assure us that our sins are washed away by the
blood of Christ, and that we are justified by his obedience, that we are
ingrafted into the body of Christ, and adopted to be the children of God.

Q. Is there any other fruit of this Sacrament?

A. It is also a Sacrament of our mortification unto sin by the death of
Christ, and of our sanctification Romans 6. 3. 4. Ephesians. 2. 12. 1. Cor. 15. 29
by his rising from the dead: also of our own resurrection in the last day, and
of our communion with the Saints of God.

Qu. Why are infants baptized?

A. Because being borne in the covenant and communion of the Church, they are
holy unto the Lord as was Isaac, who was circumcised the eight day 1. Cor. 7. 14


Qu. What is the Supper of the Lord?

A. A Sacrament, in bread and wine visibly representing unto us the death and
sacrifice of Christ, Mat. 26. 28 1. Cor. 11. 24
and assuring us of the benefit thereof.

Q. What else?

A. A pledge of our spiritual communion with Christ the bread of life and food
of our souls, whereby 1. Cor. 10. 16 Ioh. 6. 51.
he dwells in us, and we in him, and are made bone of his bone and flesh of
his flesh. It is also a pledge of our love toward all men. Ephesians. 5. 30.


Q. Who are fit to be admitted unto this sacrament?

A. Such only as can and do examine themselves 1. ^or. 11. 28
that they may be worthy receivers thereof.

Q. Wherein stands this examination?

A. We must examine our knowledge and profiting in the principles of religion,
our faith in applying that we know unto our selves, our repentance and purpose
of amendment of life, finally our reconciliation with others, and love toward
all men even Mat. 5. 24.
our enemies.

V.
Qu. Our salvation then being in Christ, not in our selves; and enjoyed by
faith in him: may we not Romans 6. 1.
now live as we lust?

A. God forbid. Nay who so is in Christ is a new 2. Cor. 5. 17. Ephesians. 2. 10.
2. Tim. 2. 19
creature, and who so names the name of Christ must depart from iniquity.

Qu. Why so?

A. Because that grace of God which brings salvation unto all men, teaches
us to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, Tit. 2.
11.
righteously, and godly in this present world.

Q. Must we then be a people studious of good works? Tit. 2. 14.


A. Christ therefore died for us and rose again, that we who live by him,
should not live unto our 2. Cor. 5. 15. Ephesians. 2. 10.
selves but unto him: exercising those good works which he has appointed us
to walk in.

Q. Are not then good works necessary unto salvation?

A. They are necessary in those that are saved, Heb. 12. 14. Ephesians. 2. 9.
but not necessary unto salvation.

Qu. How so?

A Because we are first saved by faith in Christ, before we can do any good
work: for whatsoever Romans 14. 23.
is not of faith is sin.

Q. May we not satisfy Gods justice, nor merit salvation by weldoing?

A. Our satisfaction and merit is only in the death and righteousness of
Christ Jesus: besides Act. 4. 12.
which there is none other. As for our works, as they follow our salvation and
go not before it: so Romans 7. 21. Luc. 17. 10.
in this life they are always imperfect. Also they are due unto God, and
therefore cannot indebt him unto us.

Q. Why should we then do good works?

A. For many causes. That God may be glorified Mat. 5. 16.
for us, and of us; that our lives may be agreeable to our profession, that we
may win others unto the faith, that we may be profitable unto our brethren 1.
Pet. 2. 12 1. Pet. 3. 1.
both in example and duty: and that by the fruits of our faith we may assure
our selves of our 2. Pet. 1. 10
calling and election.

VI.
Q. These are great motives unto weldoing: tell me now, what is the rule of
good works?

A. Not our own will or intents: nor the examples, customs or inventions of
men; but the only Law of God, contained briefly in the two tables of Esa. 8.
20. Exodus 34.
the ten commandments.

Qu. Why were they written in two tables?

A. To distinguish the worship of God, expressed in four commandments, from
our duties toward men, declared in six other commandments.

Q. What is the first commandment?

A. I the Lord am thy God, etc. Thou shall have none other Gods before me.
Exodus 20. 2.


Q. What is the meaning of this commandment?

A. That Jehovah the Lord be only our God: Heb. 11. 6. Psalm. 50. 15
that we honor, love, fear, and obey him, believe in him and call upon him
alone.

Q. What is the second commandment?

A. Thou shall not make to thy self any graven image, nor the likeness of any
thing etc. Deuteronomy. 4. 12.


Qu. What means this commandment?

A. That in the outward worship of God, we attempt nothing of our selves, nor
admit any thing Deuteronomy. 4. 2.
devised by others: but exercise our selves in that only, which God him self
has prescribed unto Deuteronomy. 12. 32
us in his word.

Q. What is the third commandment?

A. Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, etc.

Q. What is the meaning of this commandment?

A. That we use the name of God both in oath and otherwise with all high
reverence; also his word and works: that we fly all hypocrisy and coloring
in religion: that we abuse not the name of God directly Iam 5. 12. Mat. 5. 34.
or indirectly, in vain or false swearing, cursing, coniuring, or the like.

Q. What is the fourth commandment?

A. Remember thou keep holy the Saboth day, etc.

Q. What means this Law?

A. That resting even from our lawful labors Esa. 58. 13. Act. 2. 42. Act.
20. 7. Heb. 4. 10. Apoc. 14. 13.
for this life, we exercise our selves in the labors of everlasting life: as
the word, sacraments, prayer and thanksgiving, etc. and that we meditate that
eternal rest which abides for us in the kingdom of heaven.

Q. Is not the Jews Saboth abolished unto us?

A. Yes: but in place thereof succeeds the christian 1. Cor. 16. 1. Apoc. 1.
10.
Saboth, called the Lords day.

Q. Now follow the commandments of the second table, concerning our duties
toward men: what is the fifth commandment?

A. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy Ephesians. 6. 2.
days may be long etc.

Q What is the sense of this commandment?

A. That we love, honor, obey, and relieve all those whom God has made
superiors unto us, either Romans 13. 4. Coloss. 2. 22.
in nature or in policy: as parents, magistrates, ministers, masters, and
elders. Who also are Heb. 3. 17. Iosu 24. 15. Genesis 18. 19.
bound to perform unto us the duties of their callings.

Q. What is the sixth commandment?

A. Thou shall do no murder. Leuit. 19. 18


Q. Tell me the meaning thereof.

A. That we offend not against the life or person of our neighbor, and
therefore fly all those things that tend unto blood That we guard and relieve
Gen 9. 5. Ephesians. 4. 26. Romans 12. 19
them with all the means and mercy we are able.

Q. What means the seventh commandment Thou shall not commit adultery.

A. That keeping our bodies holy and undefiled unto God, by using all good
means making thereto; 1. These. 4. 4. 1. Cor. 6. 15. 19. 20. 1. Cor. 7. 2. 39.
we neither assault nor betray the chastity of others: and that not having the
gift of continency, we marry, only in the Lord.

Q. The eight commandment, Thou shall not steal, what requires it?

A. That for outward things we remove not the bounds which God him self has
set, neither by violence nor by fraud: but contenting our selves Ph^l. 4. 11.
with our present estate, commend the same unto God in the diligence of our
callings: and that as Ephesians. 4. 28
good stewards we faithfully dispense that we have received. 1. Pet. 4. 10


Q. What means the ninth commandment, Thou shall not bear false witness
against thy neighbor? Deuteronomy. 19. 16


A. That neither publicly nor privately, we hurt the cause, credit, or name, of
our neighbor, especially Prou. 10. 12 Eccles. 7. Romans 16. 18
our superiors: but assist and defend them therein: that we lie not, flatter,
slander, or the like: and that we maintain not others in the same.

Q. The tenth commandment, Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, nor his
wise, nor etc. Romans 7. 7.
what does it mean?

A. That we keep even our hearts and desires Prou. 4. 23. 1. Ioh. 2. 15. Romans
12. 2.
from affecting that which belongs unto others: and that we stop up the very
fountain of sin in the corruption of nature; and being renewed in the spirit
of our minds, dedecate our selves wholly unto God.

VII.
Q. Are we able to do all that which is here required at our hands?

A. We are not able of our selves so much as to 2. Cor. 3. 5. Romans 7. 23. Gal.
5. 17.
think a good thought: besides even in the children of God, the flesh evermore
fights against the spirit.

Q. Whence then is our ability?

A. It is God that gives both the will and the Phil. 2. 13.
deed, in that being made members of the body of Christ, we receive from him a
measure of knowledge, Ephesians. 4. 16.
desire, and power to do the will of God which graces he daily increases in us
by hearing, reading and meditation of his word etc. and by calling upon his
name.

Q. May we then come unto the Lord for all good things, and for power against
evil?

A. We are commanded so to do, and promised Mat. 7. 7. Ioh. 16. 23. 1. Ioh. 5.
14.
that we shall obtain whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, and in
the name of Christ Jesus.

Q. How must we prepare our selves unto prayer?

A. We must consider how great a mercy it is that we have this access unto
God: who he is that Romans 8. 26.
we come unto: what sense we have of the want of that we ask at his hands: our
prayers must be earnest and with importunity, also in faith and assurance Iam.
1. 6.
of Gods goodness. And finally we must pray not only for our selves, but also
for all men, even our enemies.

Q. What form and manner is here to be observed?

A. Our present occasions, and the feeling of our necessities will best direct
us herein. But we may conclude and shut up our prayers with that form Mat. 6.
9. Luc. 11. 2.
which our Savior Christ has taught us.

Q. Rehea^se the same.

A. Our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name: Thy kingdom come: Thy
will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread: And
forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us: And
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the
kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

VIII.
Q. What means S. Paul when he says unto Timothy, Exercise thy self unto
godliness? 1. Tim. 4. 7.


A. That as the arts of this world taught by precepts, are helped by practice:
so after the graces before mentioned, there is no small help unto godliness
in such exercises as are commended unto us either by precept or example, in the
word of God. Heb. 5. 14.


Q. What are those exercises?

A. Sorrow for sin past, fear and care against temptation: labor after that
which is good: accusing Psalm. 51. 14 Prou. 14. 16 Eccles. 1. 2. Tit. 2. 12. 1.
Cor. 9. 27.
and rebuking of our selves: mourning over the vanity of this life: an holy
and sober use of Gods blessings: fasting, and other chastisements of the flesh:
couenanting with our selves to leave evil, and Psalm. 119. 106.
do good: imitation of the godly, and conference with others, both helping
them, and receiving help of them.

Q. Are there any other besides these?

A. We shall not a little stir up our selves, if we seriously consider the
works of God in creating the world: his power, providence and wisdom in
governing Psalm. 19. 1.
the same: his judgments upon the wicked, and his mercies toward those that
obey him. Psalm. 73. 1.


Q. Proceed unto the rest.

A. Satietie and weariness of this sinful life, with desire to be with
Christ. Meditation of death, burial, resurrection, and the judgment to come:
Philip. 1* 23
the misery of the damned, the felicity of the elect, and the eternity of
both.

Q. Remain there yet any more?

A. The particular consideration of Gods benefits toward our selves, renewed
upon us every morning, and of our deliverance from many evils and Lam. 3. 23
dangers we might have fallen into: a wise estimation Heb. 12. 7. 10. 1. Cor.
11. 3 1. Pet. 1. 7.
of those afflictions of body, and griefs of mind, losses, perils, etc.
wherewith the Lord does either chastise our sins, or try our faith.

Q. These for the most part are done by our selves: may we not also be helped
by the duty of others toward us?

A. Yes, and that greatly, through the blessing of God; as by his ministers,
magistrates, and all that Romans 13. 4
have power or authority over us; when they instruct, exhort, admonish, rebuke
or ce^sure us: which they are commanded to do, and we to accept at their hands
for our good.

Q. What is the sum of all that has bin said?

A. That there is one only true God in three persons. That all men are
sinners, and the reward of sin everlasting damnation. That our only remedy
is Christ Jesus, apprehended by faith alone. That faith is the gift of God
wrought in us by the Gospel preached, and confirmed by the use of the
Sacraments. That they that live by Christ, must live not unto them selves but
unto him: that the rule of good works is the only law of God, unto the
obedience whereof we are enabled by grace, and the gifts of the spirit, and
helped forwards daily by the holy and Christian exercises of our faith.

FINIS.
