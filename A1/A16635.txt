Here begins the Iustes of the month of May parfurnysshed and done by
Charles brandon. Thomas knyuet. Gyles Capell / and Wyllyam Hussy. The.xxii.
year of the reygne of our sovereign lord King Henry the seventh.

THe month of May with amerous beloved
Plasauntly past wherein there has been proved
Feats of arms and no persons reproved
That had courage
In armoure bright to show their personage
On stedes strong sturdy and corsage
But rather praised for their vassellage
As reason was
In which season thus fortuned the case
A lady fair most beautyuous of face
With servants four brought was in to a place
Staged about
Whereon stood lords and ladies a great route
And many a knight and squire also stout
That the place was as full as it be might
On every side
That to behold the Iustes did abide
Till that the pryse by the Judges was tried
And by the herodes that truth well espied
Therefore puruayde
Thus these four servants of this lady foresaid
Entered the field / there for to be assayde
Gorgyously apparayled and arayde
And for pleasaunce
And in a manner for a cognysaunce
Of Mayes month they bare a souenaunce
Of a verte cocle was the resemblaunce
Tatched right fast
About their necks as long as May did last
But about their necks it was not cast
For challenge / but they weere it till May was past
Ready to Just
Their armure clear relucent without ruste
Their horses barded trottynge on the duste
Procured gentle hertes unto lust
And to solace
Specially such as Venus did enbrace
Or as of Cupyde followed the trace
Or such as of Mars desired the grace
For to attain
And as touching this lady sovereign
Had such beauty / it would an heart constrayne
To serve her / though he knew to lose his pain
She was so shene
She and her servants clad were all in grene
Her fetures fresshe none can dyscryue I wene
For beauty she might well have been a queen
She young of aege
Was set most goodly hye upon a stage
Under a hauthorne made by the ourage
Of Flora that is of heavenly parage
In her hand was
Of half an hour with sand rennynge a glass
So contryued it kept truly the space
Of the half hour and did it never pass
But for to tell
How this lady that so far did excel
Was named if I advise me well
Lady of May she hight / after Aprell
Began her reygne.
Whose time dury^ge her servants took great pain.
Before her to show pleasure sovereign.
So that in field who that came them again
In armoure bright.
On horsbacke mounted for to prove their might
Two servants of this lady of delight
Should be mounted / armed / and ready dyght
At a tyltes end
That to parfurnysshe their challenge did entende
First one of them half hour should dyspende
With him that came first in field to defend
With coronall.
With great speres that were not shapen small
And when a spear was broken forthewithall
The trompettes blewe with sounes musycall
Half hour done
Another chalenger was ready sone
With another defendaunt to rone
And so the defendauntes one after one
Each day by twain
Chalengers answered were to their great pain
And artycled it was in words plain
That if a chalenger any hurt did sustain
Another might
Of his fellows came to field ready dyght
To maynteyne his fellows challenge and right
Their artycles also did it recyte
Thus who came there
Horsed and in armoure burnysshed clear
As a defendaunt he should chose his spear
And rynne half hour with a chalengere
Which season done
A trumpet blewe to give warning right soon
Thus the Iustes held from twain after none
Till six was strycke of clockes mo than one
Which hours past
The defendauntes the tylte a bout compast
And with trumpettes out of the field they past
The chalengers in the field abode last
Every each day
And one of them the lady did conuaye
That named was the young lady of May
From her hye stage with flowers made so gaye
And there ready
Was his felawe him to accompany
Thus the chalengers melodyously
About the tylte rode also right warrely
In their armure
Complete save of their heed pieces pure
And in this wise they made departure
Accompanied with many a creature
Young and lusty
On horses gambawdynge wonderously
That it seemed as to a man's eye
That they would have hanged still in the sky
Other there were.
That were Ioly and gorgyas in their gere
And when they list could well handle a spear
That came each day to serve other men there
On each party.
And did in each thing indeferently
It came be ye sure of right great curtesy
Of the chalengers I shall you certefy
How they were pressed.
Twyse in the weke in the field ready dressed
During the May and chosen for days best
Were sunday and thursday and metelyest
To show pleasure
With speres great them to adventure
And who in presence of this lady pure
Brake most speres a gold ring should recure
Of this lady.
And again on the party contrary
If the defendaunt on his party
Of speres allowed break not so many
As chalengere.
Or he went thens humbly he should apere
Before this lady most comely of chere
And to present unto her a ring there
This order set.
Was with artycles moo whereof to treat
Should be to long but who best had the feate
Was gladdest man / but he the price did get
That speres brake
Most in the field yet other had no lake
Of speres brekynge for to here the crake
Would cause any lusty heart pleasure to take
What with the brute
Of trumpettes and many another flute
Of taboryns and of many a douce lute
The mynstrelles were proprely clade in suit
All this deuyse
Was worthy praise after my poor advise
Sith it was to no man's preiudyse
To pass the time this merciall excercyse
Was commendable.
Specially for folks honorable
And for other gentylmen thereto able.
And for defense of realms profitable
Is the usage.
Therefore good is to have parfyght knowlage
For all men that have youth or metely age
How with the spear their enemies to outrage
At every need.
And how he should also govern his stead
And for to use instead of other wede
To were armure complete from foot to head
Is right metely.
It encourages also a body
Enforcing him to be the more hardy
And sith it is so necessary
I them commend
That to defend
Them self pretend
Valyauntly
And dyscommende
Them that dyspende
Their life to end
In vain folly
Some reprehende
Such as entende
To condescende
To chyualry
God them amend
And grace them send
Not to offend
More till they deye
The End of the Iustes of May.
Here begins the Iustes and tourney of ye month of June parfurnysshed and
done by Richard Graye earl of Kent / by Charles brandon with their two aids
against all comers. The.xxii. year of the reygne of out sovereign lord king
Henry ye seventh.

FOr as much as young folk can not deuyse.
To pass time in more noble excersyse
Than in the ancient knights practyse
Of days old.
That were in time of Arthur king most bold
That this realm than named Brytayne did hold
Of whose round table and noble household
Were knights good
And diverse of them borne of ryall blood
And other that were of right manly mode
That auentred both through forest and flode
To get honor
Remembrance whereof should in every hour
Be unto us daily a parfyte myrroure
So that we should enforce us to our power
To win such lose
As these knights that were vyctoryose
And though that it be now more sumptuose
Than / than sith Mayes servants gracyose
Has put in ure
Of aunterose the old adventure
Called sometime cheualrous pleasure
Whereby they have won of each creature
Laud in this May
During the month of June every sunday
Two chalengers in blewe did them assaye
Of horse and man first day was their array
Sarcenet blue
And their armoure painted of the same hue
At the field end was pyght for to say true
A pauyllyon on the grass fresshe and nue
Wherein these twain
Chalengers for to arm them did remain
When they were armed at ease without pain
They issued to begin with all their main
Their challenge there
Against all defendauntes that would appear
After the enter as is the manner
About the field they were brought every where
That was all plain
Without a tylte abiding time certain
By the king assygned our prince sovereign
With sporres sharp two courses to sustain
In blanke armure
Against each comer that list to adventure
The courses done with swerdes sharp and sure
Save only of their points rebature
They did tourney
Full strokes syx each other to assaye
And each man did his best I dare well say
Eueryche of them thought to bear the price away
Their strokes done
The defendaunt presented him self soon
Before a pryncesse that of this regyon
Has to fader king and Emperor alone
Whose vyctory
Hye magesty with tryumphaunt regally
And noble fame of prudent polycy
Known is in every realm vulgarely
To his honor
And to ours of whom he is gouernoure
From this royal reed rose and stately flower
And from the white of all virtue myrroure
This young lady
This confortable blossom named Mary
Spronge is to all Englondes glory
With both roses ennued most swetely
By dame nature
That every thing living has in her cure
But when she made this propre portrayture
She did that might be done to creature.
And not only
For excellent birth but surmountynge beauty
In the world of her aege most womanly
Like to be to pryncesses exemplary
For her virtue
Unto which pryncesse the defendauntes did sewe.
Besechynge her grace to have syx strokes new
To whose request this pryncesse tresshe of hew
Right soon did grant
Which had / they returned on horses puyssaunt
And gave syx strokes the chalengers to daunt
But who did best I make none auaunt
But thus it was
Pyeces of harneys flewe in to the place
Their swerdes brake they smote thycke and a pace
They spared not cors / armyt / nor yet vambrace
They list not sport
For there were none of all the lusty sort
That escaped fre and he the truth report
To all beholders it did great conforte
And first of all
To se the speres fle intronchons small
And to here the trompettes so musycall
It was an armony most special
The tournay done
Diverse defendauntes touched their challenge sone
In the kings presence though I name none
That for the same had made prouysyon
Thus this day paste
THe next sunday the chalengers in have
Enter the field and by the king they past
And obeysauntly down their heedes they cast
And their array
Was blue bawdekyn of horse and man that day
The trompettes and other did them convey
About the field and from them went away
In for to bring
The defendauntes that made short taryenge
On horses barded right rich to my semynge
Which made after their in coming
Their obeyssaunce
Unto the king both of England and of France
And tweyne to them with speres did auaunce
And who that first should prove his valyaunce
He chose his spear
The other to a chalenger one did bear
Shortly with them together they ran there
As though neither of them other did fere
And so they ran.
Till they had had two courses every man.
And than the tornay sharply they began
And as they did the first day they did than
Valyauntly.
The artycles did also specyfy
The chalengers should have in company
Aids twain that should be there ready
And so they had.
That to arms were desirous and glad
And it appeared by their strokes sad
Their arms ought not to be called bad
Who took good head.
This day a chalenger was hurt in deed
For which an aid came that day in his stead
To bid him have him doubt not it was no need
To the turnay.
It were to long to tell all done that day
Therefore I will it for this time delay
And part I will show of the last sunday
That Iustes were.
The chalengers and their aids in fere
Were all present and gorgyas in their gere
Blewe clothe of gold that were costly and dear
Both horse and man.
And to be short if they the first day wan
Each man honor in like wise they did than
They were commended of such as tell can
Thereof the guyse.
Though foles uncunning list some despise
And one of them should such a thing enterprise
I deem he would be a simple prentyse
To chyualry.
Yet such that lewd be / be most besy
To report of gentylmen vylany
And yet wise men there being sees not why
Lay that aparte.
And of their challenge I will you aduerte
In asure being a whyre ennamelde heart
Between. R. and. H. plain and ouerte
Which were applied.
To Roy Henry, and eke it sygnefyed
In steadfast asure a color constant tried
That the white heart wout spot should abide
Ever in one
This was thereof the hole entencyon
Though any after his opinion
To the chalengers reprehensyon
List other say.
Thus in blewe clad they went the first sunday
In sign as the color of their array
Betokened so would they be always
Steadfast and true.
And though each sunday they were changed new
In their apparayle yet the color blewe
Of their challenge was the lyurey and hue
In which color
Their hertes white and pure in every hour
Shall truly rest for any storm or shoure
And to serve ever truly to their power
Our king royal
That is our sovereign and prince natural
Whose noble acts and faytes mercyall
Shall he had in remembrance immortal
The world through out
And for to speak now of this lusty route
With spear and sword they were sturdy and stout
As I am enfourmed without doubt
Further also
Artycles made there were many one mo
But as it lyked the king / all was do
And reason was also it should be so
For for his sake
This thing of pleasure was there undertake
For in his presence this pastyme to make
Was to cause solace in him to awake
This their entente
Was verily after my Judgment
And first of all of Richard earl of Kent
And in like wise of all the remanent
And in party
For to say true I exsteme verily
Every man of them was the more ready
Perceiving that our young prince Henry
Should it behold
Which was to them more conforte manyfolde
Than of the world all the treasure and gold
His presence gave them courage to be bold
And to endure
Sith our prince most comely of stature
Is desirous to the most knyghtly ure
Of arms to which marcyall adventure
Is his courage
Notwithstondynge his young and tender aege
He is most comely of his parsonage
And as desirous to this ourage
As prince may be
And though a prince / and kings soue be he
It pleases him of his benygnyte
To suffer gentylmen of low degree
In his presence
To speak of arms and of other defense
Without doing unto his grace offense
But and I should do all my delygence
Yet in no wise
Can I determyne who that wanne the price
For each man did the best he could deuyse
And therefore I can none of them despise
They did so well
The Iuges that marked it best can tell
And the herodes that wrote euerydell
Who wan the gree to me it is council
But in this wise
This weerly usage and martes entrepryse
These months twain young folk did excercyse
Not only thereof to have the practyse
But the chyef thing
Was to show pleasure to our sovereign the king
Henry of that name the seventh in reckoning
After the conquest / for whose preserving
Let us still pray
That he may live prosperously always
And after this life that he also may
Joy among aungelles for ever and ay
And his issue
After him long to reygne and continue
And that their subgecies to them may be true
And that they may perceuer in virtue
And come to bliss
Perpetual
Where ever is
Has be and shall
Joy eternal
Amen say we
For charity
Some are so accustomed evil to report
That with great pain / skantly they can say well
For and one were strong / as Sampson le forte
As manly as Hector / that did excel
As wise as sage Salamon in council
Or had won conquestes as did Alexandre
Yet false tongues would be ready to sklaundre
Like wise if they / that did Just and tourney
Had done as well / as Lancelot du lake
Some of envy dysdeynously would say
The entrepryse was fondly undertake
But it was done but only for the sake
Of king Henry our natural sovereign lord
And of the prince / who list it to remorde
