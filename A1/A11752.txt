THE NOBLEMEN, BARONS, GENTLEMEN, BORROWES, MINISTERS AND COMMONS; Subscribers

Printed at Glasgow by George Anderson, in the Year of Grace, 1638.

The Protestation of the general Assembly of the Church of SCOTLAND, etc.
WE Commissioners from Presbyteries, Burghes, and Universities, now conveened
in a full and free Assembly of the Church of Scotland, indicted by his
Majesty, and gathered together in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ the only
Head, and Monarch of his own Church; And We Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen,
Ministers, Burgesses and Commons, Subscribers of the Confession of Faith, Make
it known that where We His Majesty's loyal Subjects of all degrees,
considering and taking to heart the many and great innovations and corruptions
lately by the Prelates and their adherents intruded of this Church, which had
been before in great purity to our unspeakable comfort established amongst
us, were moved to present many earnest desires and humble supplications to his
sacred Majesty, for granting a free general Assembly, as the only legal and
ready mean to try these innovations, to purge out the corruptions, and settle
the order of the church, for the good of Religion, the honor of the King, and
the comfort and peace of the Kirk and Kingdom: It pleased his gracious
Majesty, out of his Royal bounty, to direct unto this Kingdom, the Noble
and Potent Lord, James Marquis of Hammiltoun, with Commission to hear and
redress the just grievances of the good Subjects, who by many petitions, and
frequent conferences, being fully informed of the absolute necessity of a free
general Assembly, as the only Judicatorie which had power to remedy those
evils, was pleased to undergo the pains of a voyage to England for presenting
the pitiful condition of our Church to his sacred Majesty; And the said
Commissioner his Grace returned again in August last, with power to indict an
Assembly, but with the condition of such prelimitations, as did both destroy
the freedom of an Assembly, and could no ways cure the present diseases of
this Church: which was made so clearly apparent to his Grace, that for
satisfying the reasonable desire of the Subjects, groaning under the weariness
and prejudices of longsome attendance, He was again pleased to under-take
another journey to His Majesty, and promised to endeavor to obtain a free
General Assembly, without any prelimitation, either of the constitution and
members, or matters to be treated, or manner, and order of proceeding, so that
if any question should arise concerning these particulars, the same should be
cognosced, judged, and determined by the Assembly, as the only judge
competent: And accordingly by warrant from our Sacred Sovereign, returned to
this Kingdom, and in September last, caused indict a free General Assembly,
to be holden at Glasgow, the 21. of November instant, to the unspeakable joy of
all good Subjects and Christian hearts, who thereby did expect the perfect
satisfaction of their long expectations; and the final remedy of their
pressing grievances: But these hopes were soon blasted: for albeit the
Assembly did meet and begin at the appointed day, and has hitherto continued,
still assisted with his Graces personal presence, yet His Grace has never
allowed any freedom to the Assembly, competent to it by the Word of God, acts
and practice of this church, and his Majesty's Indiction, but has labored to
restrain the same, by protesting against all the acts made therein, and
against the constitution thereof by such members, as by all law reason and
custom of this church were ever admitted in our free Assemblies, and by
denying his apprebation to the things proponed and coucluded, though most
clear, customable, and uncontraverted.

And now since his Grace after the presenting and reading of his own commission
from our sacred Sovereign, and after his seeing all our commissions from
Presbyteries and Burghes produced and examined, and the assembly constitute of
all the members by unanimous consent, does now to our greater grief without
any just cause or occasion offered by us, unexpectedly depart and discharge any
further meeting, or proceeding in this Assembly, under the pain of treason;
and after seven days sitting, declare all Acts made, or hereafter to be made
in this Assembly, to be of no force nor strength; and that for such causes as
are either expressed in his Majesty's former proclamations, (and so are
answered in our former protestations) or set down in the declinatour, and
protestation presented in name of the Prelates, (which are fully cleared in our
answer made thereto) or else were long since proponed by the Commissioner his
G. in his eleven articles or demands sent unto us, before the indiction of the
Assembly (and so were satisfied by our answers, which his Grace acknowledged,
by promising after the recept thereof to procure a free general Assembly, with
power to determine upon all questions, anent the members, manner, and matters
thereof) all which for avoiding tediousness we here repeat: Or otherwise the
said causes alleged by the Commissioner, were proponed by His Grace, in the
Assembly; such as first, that the Assembly refused to read the Declinatour
and Protestation exhibited by the Prelates, which nevertheless was publicly
read and considered by the assembly, immediately after the election of a
Moderatour and constitution of the Members, before the which, there was no
assembly established, to whom the same could have been read: Next, that ruling
Elders were permitted to have voice in the election of commissioners from
Presbyteries, which was known to His Grace, before the indiction and meeting
of the assembly, and is so agreeable to the acts and practice of this church,
inviolably observed before the late times of corruption, that not one of the
assembly doubted thereof, to whom by the indiction and promise of a free
assembly, the determination of that question, anent the members constituent
property belonged.

And last, that the voices of the six Assessors, who did sit with His Grace,
were not asked and numbered, which we could not conceive to be any just cause
of offense, since after 39. National assemblies of this reformed church, where
neither the Kings Majesty, nor any in his name was present, at the humble and
earnest desire of the assembly, His Majesty graciously vouchsafed His presence
either in His own Royal Person, or by a commissioner, not for voting or
multiplying of voices, but as Princes and Emperors of old, in a Princely
manner to countenance that meeting, and to preside in it for external order;
and if We had been honored with His Majesty's Personal presence, His
Majesty (according to the practice of King James of blessed memory) would
have only given his own Judgment in voting of matters, and would not have
called others who had not been clothed with commission from the church to
carry things by plurality of voices.

Therefore in conscience of our duty to God and his truth, the King and his
honor, the Church and her liberties, this Kingdom and her peace, this
Assembly and her freedom, to our selves and our safety, to our Posterity,
Persons and Estates, We profess with sorrowful and heavy, but loyal
hearts. That We cannot dissolve this Assembly, for the reasons following.

1. For the reasons already printed anent the necessity of conveening a
General Assembly, which are now more strong in this case, seeing the
assembly was already indicted by his Majesty's authority, did conveene, and
is fully constitute in all the members thereof, according to the Word of GOD,
and discipline of this church, in the presence and audience of his Majesty's
Commissioner; who has reallie acknowledged the same, by assisting therein
seven days, and exhibition of His Majesty's Royal Declaration, to be
registrate in the books of this assembly, which accordingly is done.

2. For the reasons contained in the former Protestations made in name of the
Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons, whereunto We do now
iudicially adhere, as also unto the Confession of Faith and covenant,
subscribed and sworn by the body of this Kingdom.

3. Because as We are obliged by the application and explication subioyned
necessarily to the Confession of Faith subscribed by Us; So the Kings Majesty,
and his Commissioner, and Privy Council; have urged many of this kingdom to
subscribe the Confession of Faith made in anno 1580. and 1590: and so to
return to the doctrine and discipline of this Church, as it was then
professed: But it is clear by the doctrine and discipline of this church,
contained in the book of Policy then registrate in the books of assembly,
and subscribed by the Presbyteries of this church; That it was most unlawful
in it self, and prejudicial to these privileges which Christ in his Word has
left to his church, to dissolve or break up the assembly of this church, or
to stop and stay their proceedings in constitution of acts for the welfare of
the church, or execution of discipline against offenders; and so to make i^
appear, that Religion and Church Government should depend absolutely upon the
pleasure of the Prince.

4. Because there is no ground of pretense either by Act of Assembly, or
Parliament, or any preceding practice, whereby the Kings Majesty may lawfully
dissolve the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, far less His
Majesty's Commissioner, who by his commission has power to indict and keep it,
secundum legem and praxim: But upon the contrary, His Majesty's prerogative
Royal, is declared by Act of Parliament, to be nowayes prejudicial to the
privileges and liberties, which God has granted to the spiritual
office-bearers, and meetings of this Church; which are most frequently ratified
in Parliaments, and especially in the last Parliament holden by His Majesty
himself, which privileges and liberties of the church, his Majesty will never
diminish or infringe, being bound to maintain the same in integrity by
solemn oath given at His Royal Coronation in this Kingdom.

5. The Assemblies of this Church have still inioyed this freedom of
uninterrupted sitting, without or notwithstanding any contramand, as is evident
by all the Records thereof; and in special by the general Assembly holden in
anno 1582. which being charged with letters of Horning by the Kings Majesty
his Commissioner and Council, to stay their process against Master Robert
Montgomerie, pretended Bishop of Glasgow, or otherwise to dissolve and rise,
did notwithstanding show their liberty and freedom, by continuing and sitting
still, and without any stay, going on in that process against the said Master
Robert, to the final end thereof: And thereafter by letter to his Majesty,
did show clearly, how far his Majesty had been uninformed, and upon
misinformation, prejudged the prerogative of Jesus Christ, and the liberties of
this Church, and did inact and ordain, that none should procure any such
warrant or charge under the pain of excommunication.

6. Because now to dissolve, after so many supplications and complaints, after
so many reiterated promises, after our long attendance and expectation, after
so many references of processes from Presbyteries, after the public indiction
of the Assembly, and the solemn Fast appointed for the same, after frequent
convention, formal constitution of the Assembly in all the members thereof a
and seven days sitting, were by this act to offend God, contemn the Subjects
petitions, deceive many of their conceived hopes of redress of the calamities
of the Church and Kingdom, multiply the combustions of this Church, and make
every man despair hereafter ever to see Religion established, Innovations
removed, the Subjects complaint respected, or the offenders punished with
consent of authority, and so by casting the church loose and desolate, would
abandon both to ruin.

7. It is most necessary to continue this Assembly for preveening the
prejudices which may ensue upon the pretense of two Covenants, whereas indeed
there is but one. That first subscribed in 1500. and 1590. being a National
covena^^, and oath to God; which is lately renewed by ^s, with that necessary
explanation, which the corruptions introduced since that time contrary to the
same, enforced: which is also a knowledged by the Act of council in September
last, declaring the same to be subscribed, as it was meaned the time of the
first subscription: And therefore for removing that shame, and all preiudices
which may follow upon the show of two different covenants and confessions of
Faith in one Nation, The Assembly cannot dissolve, before it try, find and
determine, that both these covenants, are but one and the self same covenant:
The latter renewed by Us, agreeing to the true genuine sense and meaning of the
first, as it was subscribed in anno 1580.

For these and many other reasons, We the Members of this assembly, in our
own name, and in the name of the Kirk of Scotland, whom We represent; and We
Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Ministers, Burgesses, and Commons before
mentioned, do solemnly declare in the presence of the everliving God, and
before all men; And protest,

1. That our thoughts are not guilty of any thing which is not incumbent to
us, as good Christians toward God, and loyal Subjects toward our sacred
Sovereign.

2. That all the Protestations general or particular, proponed or to be
proponed by the commissioner his Grace, or the Prelates and their adherents,
may be presently discussed before this general Assembly, being the highest
Ecclesiastical iudicatorie of this kingdom: and that his Grace depart not
till the same be done,

3. That the Lord commissioner depart not, till this Assembly do fully settle
the solid peace of this church, cognoscing and examining the corruptions
introduced upon the doctrine and discipline thereof: and for attaining hereof,
and removing all just exceptions which may be taken at our proceedings, we
attest GOD the searcher of all hearts, that our intentions, and whole
proceedings in this present assembly, have been, are, and shall be according
to the word of GOD the laws and constitutions of this church, the confession
of faith; our national oath, and that measure of light, which GOD the father
of light shall grant us, and that in the sincerity of our hearts, without any
preoccupation or passion.

4. That if the Commissioner his Grace depart and leave this church and
kingdom in this present disorder, and discharge this assembly, that it is
both lawful and necessary for Us to sit still and continue in keeping this
present Assembly; indicted by His Majesty, till we have tried, judged,
censured all the bygone evils, and the introductors, and provided a solid
course for continueing Gods truth in this land with purity and liberty,
according to his Word, our oath and Confession of Faith, and the lawful
constitutions of this Church; and that with the grace of God, We and every one
of Us adhering hereunto, shall sit still and continue in this Assembly, till
after the final settling and conclusion of all matters, it be dissolved by
common consent of all the members thereof.

5. That this Assembly is and should be esteemed and obeyed, as a most
lawful, full and free general Assembly of this Kingdom: And that all acts,
sentences, constitutions, censures and proceedings of this Assembly, are in
the self, and should be reputed, obeyed and observed by all the Subjects of
this Kingdom, and members of this Church, as the actions, sentences,
constitutions, censures and proceedings of a full and free general Assembly
of this Church of Scotland, and to have all ready execution, under the
Ecclesiastical pains contained, or to be contained therein, and conform
thereto in all points.

6. That whatsoever inconvenience fall out, by impeding, molesting, or staying
the free meeting, sitting, reasoning, or concluding of this present Assembly,
in matters belonging to their judicatorie, by the word of God, laws and
practice of this Church, and the confession of faith, or in the observing and
obeying the acts, ordinances and conclusions thereof, or execution to follow
thereupon: That the same be not imputed unto Us, or any of Us, who most ard
entlie desired the concurrance of his Majesty's Commissioner to this lawful
Assembly: But upon the contrare, that the Prelates and their adherentes, who
have protested and declined this present Assembly, in conscience of their own
guiltiness, not dareing to abide any legal trial, and by their
misinformation have moved the Commissioner his Grace to dep^rt and discharge
this Assembly, be esteemed repute and holden the Disturbers of the Peace, and
Overthrowers of the Liberties of the Church, and guilty of all the evils which
shall follow hereupon, and condignely consured; according to the greatness of
their fault, and Acts of the Church and Realm: And to this end. We again and
again do by these presents cite and summond them, and every one of them, to
compeere before this present general Assembly, to answer to the premises,
and to give in their reasons, defenses, and answers against the complaints
given in, or to be given in against them, and to hear probation led, and
sentence pronounced against them, and conform to our former citations, and
according to Justice, with certification as effeirs. Like as by these presents
We summond and cite all those of His Majesty's Council, or any other, who
have procured, consented, subscribed, or ratified this present Proclamation, to
be responsable to His Majesty and three Estates of Parliament, for their
counsel given in this matter, so highly importing His Majesty, and the whole
Realm, conform to the 12. Act, King James 4. Parliament 2. And protest for
remedy of law against them, and every one of them:

7. And lastly We protest, that as We adhere to the former Protestations all
and every one of them, made in the name of the Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen,
Ministers, Burghes, and Commons; So seeing We are surprised by the
Commissioner his Graces sudden departing, far contrary to His Majesty's
indiction, and our expectation, We may extend this our Protestation, and add
more reasons thereunto in greater length and number, whereby We may fully
clear before God and man, the equity of our intentions, and lawfulness of
our proceedings: And upon the whole premises, the foresaids persons for
themselves, and in name aforesaid asked Instruments. This was done in the high
Church of Glasgow, in public audience of the Assembly, begun in presence of
the Commissioner his Grace, who removed and refused to hear the same to the
end, The twenty eight day of November: and upon the Mercate Cross of Glasgow,
The twenty ninth day of the said month, The year of GOD, 1638. respective.

FINIS.
