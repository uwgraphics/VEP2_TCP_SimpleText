To the right Honorable and most Virtuous Lady, the Lady Anne, Countess of
Warwick.
I Am accused of presumption (right excellent Lady) by this noble Commonwealth
which I here present unto you, who gloriously shining in the clear knowledge
of her own incomparable worthiness, does like a beautiful virgin, that
seeing her fair picture foulely handled of an unskillful painter, blush at the
view of her wronged beauty, and reproves me for having with such feeble forces
so far presumed in the description of her rich and royal history; a matter
which the rarest foreign spirits of our time have by their learned pens so
highly enobled with such excellent art and ornaments: she well knows the
cleernes of your judgment, and therefore fears bearing the burden and
blemishes of so great a weakness to approach the rays of a censure so
undeceivable and absolute.

I have no shield nor excuse to oppose against this just imputation, but only
the defense of your Ladishippes favors, who though by former experience
knowing my unfitness for such a work, did nevertheless impose this task
upon me.

Now therefore my humble request is, that howsoever the untuned harshnesse of
my disioynted style shall seem unpleasant in your ears, yet that you will
vouchsafe to be a gentle and propitious defendresse to this renowned
Commonwealth, that nothing more desires then to be gracious in your sight,
and here frankely offreth unto your view the naked full discovery of her fair
and be utifull lineaments, not concealing any part of her rarest perfections.
Only she humbly desires, that sithence it is her hap to be brought into
England, she may have free and quiet passage under your honorable safe
conduct and protection: for such is the general love and reverence, which the
great worthiness and integrity of your unblemished life, and your long
constant continued course in the exercise of a spotless virtue has
universally gained you, that bearing with her the fair warrant of your so many
ways enobled name, she shall not need to fear any uncivil or disgracious
usage, no not of those, whose minds are diseased with the greatest envy.

Finally, I beseech you (good Madame) not to measure my duty toward you by
this means, wherein I seek to show it: for this I know to be ordinary and
vulgar, and so far from the satisfaction of mine own mind, as that I am in a
manner therewith displeased, but the other, if ever your commandment,
opportunity of time and occasion, or the uttermost strain of my invention and
endeavor give me leave, shall discover it self in a better proportion: for I
will never forget, but still retain engraued in the marble table of a
thankful memory (besides the duty our family owes unto that noble house
wherein you matched) the many favors you have done me in particular, and he
many ways you have sought to do me good, wherein though the violence of my
own fortune has still encountered your enaeuor, yet there remains unto me no
small comfort, and withal I do somewhat the better esteem my self, in that
your Ladishippe, whose judgment, wisdom, and virtue passes with such
general allowance; has deemed me worthy of your honorable good opinion, and
thereof has made me assured by many most essential testimonies. In conclusion
Madam, I will never cease to honor you, and in the mean time humbly beseech
you to accept in good part, these the fruits of my extreme idleness, the poor
pledges of that duty, which I would discharge toward you in greater matters,
if I were able, and for my part I will never cease to pray unto the almighty to
bless you with honor and happiness, such as so great worthiness, and virtue
deserves. Selsey this thirteenth of August. 1598.

Your Ladyshippes most faithfully JEWS

THe antique Babel, Empress of the East,
Vpreard her buildinges to the threatened sky:
And Second Babell tyrant of the West,
Her ayry Towers vpraised much more high.
But with the weight of their own surquedry,
They both are fallen, that all the earth did fear,
And buried now in their own ashes ly,
Yet showing by their heaps how great they were.
But in their place does now a third appear,
Fair Venice, flower of the last worlds delight,
And next to them in beauty draws near,
But far exceedes in policy of right.
Yet not so fair her buildinges to behold
As Lewkenors style that has her beauty told.
Edw. Spencer.
FAyer maiden town that in rich Thetis arms,
Have still been fostered since thy first foundation.
Whose glorious beauty calls unnumbered swarms
Of rarest spirits from each foreign nation,
And yet (sole wonder to all Europes ears,
Most lovely Nymph, that ever Neptune got)
In all this space of thirteen hundred years,
Thy virgins state ambition nere could blot.
Now I prognosticate thy ruinous case,
When thou shall from thy Adriatique seas,
View in this Ocean Isle thy painted face,
In these pure colors coyest eyes to please,
Then gazing in thy shadows peereles eye,
Enamored like Narcissus thou shall dye.
I. Ashley
VEnice invincible, the Adriatique wonder,
Admirde of all the world for power and glory,
Whom no ambitious force could yet bring under,
Is here presented in her States rare storye,
Where all corrupt means to aspire are curbd,
And Officers for virtues worth elected.
The contrary whereof has much disturbd
All states, where the like cause is unrespected,
A document that Justice fortifies
Each government (although in some things faulty)
And makes it dreadful to the envying eyes
Of ill affecting foes, and tyrants haulty.
Lewkenor, whom arms and letters have made known,
In this work has the fruits of either shown.

It Is not affected grace, or mocked disguise
Assures a true return from foreign parts.
Travel confounds the vain, confirms the wise,
Leukenor live thou esteemde for thy deserts,
While thy last travels do thy first commend,
To strangers proved in them a grateful friend,
And for thy absence to thy native clyme,
A welcome Venturer of rich prized time.

To the Reader.
THough I have been ever readier to wonder at the effect of things
extraordinarily strange; then well provided of judgment to examine their
causes, subiecting sundry times mine ears to the report of rare and unusual
accidents, with a greater bent of attention, then perchance to a well tempered
stayednes will seem convenient, yet me thinks that this humor of mine,
howsoever faulty, is much more excusable then that contemptuous derision of
Theyras, who presently do condemn for false fryuolous and impossible
whatsoever is not within the narrow lymits of their own capacity included,
therein to excuse their own ignorance by the disgrace of a better experience,
for mine own part therefore, though no man's conceit weaker or vnapter to
apprehend then mine, yet I ever held it decent to yield a respective gesture,
and due reputation to him, that upon his own Wise and discrere speech
beautifieth the hearer and delights the speaker.
knowledge takes upon him to deliver unto the hearers matter moving them to
marvel, and such as common experience sometimes fails to approve, of which
sort unless the partiality of my affection deceive me, there is not any that
does more beautify the speaker or delight the hearer, then the description of
foreign regions, the manners and customs of far distant countries, the
diuetsitie of their complections, humor, diet and attire, and such like other
singularities; especially if they come from the mouth of a wise and well
speaking traveler, to whose tongue I could willingly endure to have mine ears
inclined, while he distilleth into them the sweet liquors that he has
industriously extracted out of the painful fruits of his foreign travel;
nothing is here farther from my meaning then those who having gotten a fond
affected phrase of speech, or some conceited toys in their habit would be
accounted great travelers, because perchance they have seen the clock at
Strasburge, or can talk of Maddona Margaritas pantables, such being seconded
with no farther virtue, might much better have spent their time at home: but I
speak of the wiser sort; who returning amended in knowledge, and not corrupted
in manners, nor disguised in behavior, have by well spending their time
abroad, enabled and made themselves fit to do their country service, when
occasion requires, such in mine opinion are to be esteemed, if for nothing
else, yet in regard that neglecting nearer ways of gain (by which we see at
home even the meanest capacities do arise unto wealth, and credit) they expose
themselves to many dangers, content themselves with all unease, run through
all difficulties, subject to reprehension, and uncertain of reward, neither
caring to please their bodies, nor to fill their purses, so they may enrich
their minds with a perpetual directed intent to their countries good, of
which sometimes they are but slenderly requited, yea and oftentimes through
envy of their sufficiency d^pressed, and maliciously censured, for the most
part being used like whetstones, who giving edge to others, are themselves
still kept bare, the cause whereof as I take it proceeds through the
miraculous fertility of this age, wherein we live, which brings soorth men
so rarely qualified, and of such ripe pregnant conceits, that they can gather
out of their soft beds, and full dishes at home, better ability to judge,
bolder audacity to speak, and a quicker insight to discern and censure other
men's sufficiences, then others can in many years travel abroad with many
careful thoughts, industrious penuries and paineful inconveniences belonging
unto that life attain unto: it was not so in Homers time, for he under the
person of Ulysses endeavored to deseribe and pattern forth the most perfect and
accomplished Gentleman of Greece, he did not praise him for the nimblenesse of
his tongue, the gainesse of his clothes, nor the Ulysses praised by Homer for
having seen many countries and the fashions of many men.
boldness of his face, no nor for his superficial smattering in many books,
but he said, Multornm mores vidit and vrbes, making that the foundation
whereupon to build the rest of his praises, in fine how succesles soever their
virtuous endenours fall out, there is no kind of people with whom I do
willinglyer converse, as being fruitful and pleasing in their discourses, so
also through their acquaintance with the civility of other nations, moderate
and offenceles in their behavior, of which sort it has been my happiness to
be beholding to many of sundry nations for their friendly conversation, who
never were so willing at any time to speak, as I ever was ready to receive
their discourses with an attentive ear, wherein I always especially observed
one thing, that whether they with whom I conferred were Englishmen, French men,
Spaniards, Germains, Polonians, yea or Italians borne in the bordering
provinces, as of each sort I have been acquainted with many, though sundry of
them had been in the farthest parts of Asia and Africa, yet coming once to
speak of the city of Venice, they would enforce their speech to the highest
of all admiration, as being a thing of the greatest worthiness, and most
infinitely remarkable, that they had seen in the whole course of their travels.

Some of the youthfuller sort, would extol to the skies their humanity
toward strangers, the delicacie of their entertainments, the beauty, pomp,
and daintines of their women, and finally the infinite superflutties of all
pleasure and delights.

Other of a grauer humor would dilate of the greatness of their Empire, the
gravity of their prince, the majesty of their Senate, the vnuiolablenes of
their laws, their zeal in religion, and lastly their moderation, and equity,
wherewith they govern such subjected provinces as are under their dominion,
binding them thereby in a faster bond of obedience then all the cytadels,
garrisons, or whatsoever other tyrannical inventions could ever have brought
them unto. These and such like reports have from time to time kindled within
me so great a desire to acquaint myself with the particularities of this
famous City, that though during the time of my travel, (destinate to more
unhappy courses) I was not so fortunate as to be a beholder of the glory
thereof, yet I have not omitted from time to time to gather such observations
as well by reading the best and choicest authors entreating there of, as also
by conference with sundry well experienced gentlemen, as might not only
satisfy the curiosity of my own desire, but also deliver unto other a clear
and exact knowledge of every particularitie worthy of note, that thereunto
appartaineth, which cannot as I imagine (the nobleness of the subject
considered) but be All other excellent governments comprehended within that of
Venice.
pleasing and agreeable to the best conceipted spirits, who may out of this one
commonwelth of Venice, gather and comprehend the fruit of all whatsoever other
governments throughout the world* that are of any same or excellency: for in
the person of the Venetian prince, who sitting at the helm of this city
shines in all exterior ornaments of royal dignity; (nevertheless both he
and his authority, being wholly subjected to the laws) they may see a strange
and unusual form of a most excellent Monarchy.

Then what more perfect and lively pattern of a well ordered Aristocraticall
government can there in the world be expressed, then that of their Council
of Pregati or Senators, which being the only chief and principal members of
all supreme power; yet have not any power, mean, or possibility at all to
tyranize, or to pervert their Country laws?

Lastly if they desire to see a most rare and matchless president of a
Democrasie or popular estate, let them behold their great Council, consisting
at the least of 3000. Gentlemen, whereupon the highest strength and mightiness
of the estate absolutely relyeth, notwithstanding which number all things are
ordered with so divine a peaceablenes, and so without all tumult and confusion,
that it rather seems to be an assembly of Angels, then of men.

In fine, whithersoeuer you turn your eyes, they shall not encounter any thing
but obiectes of admiration; their justice is pure and uncorrupted: their penal
Laws most vnpardonably executed: their encouragements to virtue infinite:
especially by their distribution of offices and dignities, which is ordered in
such so secret, strange, and intricate a sort, that it utterly ouerreacheth
the subtlety of all ambitious practices, never falling upon any but upon such
as are by the whole assembly allowed for men of greatest wisdom, virtue and
integrity of life, as by the following discourse most evidently shall appear.

But besides these before rehearsed, there are sundry other so marvelous and
miraculous considerations, and in their own exceeding singularity, beyond all
resemblance or comparison with any other Commonwealth so vnspeakeablie sirange,
that their wonderful rareness being verified, makes the straungest
impossibilities not seem altogether incredible: as for example: first touching
the situation thereof, what ever has the world brought forth more monstrously
strange, then that so great and glorious a City should be seated in the
middle of the sea, especially to see such palaces, monasteries, temples,
towers, turrets, and pinacles reaching up unto the clouds, founded upon
Quagmires, and planted upon such vnfirme moorish and spungie foundations,
there being neytherwood, nor stone, nor matter fit for building within ten
miles thereof, for so far distant from it was the nearest maine land, at such
time as the first foundation was laid?

Besides, what is there that can carry a greater disproportion with common
rules of experience, the^ that unweaponed men in gowns should with such
happiness of success give direction and law to many mighty and warlike
armies both by sea and land, and that a single City unwalled, and alone should
command and over top mighty kingdoms, and such famous far extended
provinces, remaining ever it self invincible, and long robed citizens to be
served, yea and sued unto for entertainment by the greatest princes and peers
of Italy: amidst which infinite affluence of glory, and unmeasurable
mightiness of power, of which there are in sovereignty pertakers above 3000.
gentlemen, yet is there not one among them to be found that does aspire to any
greater appellation of honor, or higher title of dignity then to be called a
Gentleman of Venice, including in the same the height of all imaginable honor,
so dear unto this generous people is the name and love of their noble country?

And lastly, though not least to be wondered at, they have (as it were
entertayning a league and intelligence with the heavenly powers) preserved this
royal City of theirs this 13. hundred years since the first foundation
thereof, in an estate so perpetually flourishing and unblemished, that though
sundry and mighty kings and Emperors being enamored with her beauty and
goodlinesse, have with marvelous endeavor and multitude of armies sought to
possess themselves of so fair and precious a pray: yet have they hitherto
kept her like a pure and untouched virgin, free from the taste or violence of
any foreign enforcement.

The strange beginning, mighty increase and long continuing greatness of this
happy commowea th has served to many present writers for the glorious subject
of their learned histories: among the rest he that has written thereof with
greatest judgment and authority in my opinion, is the Cardinal Gasper
Contareno, by birth a Gentleman, and by desert and worthiness at that time a
Senator of Venice: but being now above fourscore years since he wrote the
same; since which time there have succeeded many alterations of laws, and
changes of matters in his country, I thought it not unnecessarie to add
thereunto sundry other particularities, gathered (as I said) partly by
conference, partly by reading of other learned Authors, as Donato, Justinian,
Munster, Bodin, Ant, Stella, Sansouino, Domenico Francesco, Girolamo Bardi etc.

Contareno did first write this treatise in Latin, the same being since his
time translated into Italian by a Gentleman of Italy, which translation I have
here chiefly followed, though still comparing the same with the Latin
original, in regard of my desire to express the proper names of their
Magistrates, laws, and ceremonies according to their common appellations,
which is much altered in the Latin style: I will not speak of my pains
herein, nor enter into any insinuating challenge of thanks, for in truth I
have neither taken the one, nor deserved the other, having written it at idle
times when I had nothing else to do, being at much more leisure then willingly
I would be.

But me thinks I hear it vbrayded unto me, that it is now rather a time to
do then to write: I confess it to be so for him that is well set on work:
and yet he that writes well is never the farther off from doing well: so that
for my part I hold it no disgrace to write so long as my pen utters no d
shonestie. My education has been in the wars: this I only doc to beguile
time; wishing that whosoever shall herein censure me amiss, would be as ready
as my self, both in mind and body, when either the commandment of my prince,
or the occasion of my country shalinioine me to other courses: in the
meanetime utterly careless of mine own praise, I yet entreat them that shall
read this discourse, to intertaine this famous Common wealth with all
friendlinesse and favor, if in no other regard, yet in this, that therest of
the whole world honoreth her with the name of a Virgin, a name though in all
places most sacred and venerable, yet in no place more dearly and religiously
to be reverenced, then with us, who have thence derived our blessedness,
which I beseech God may long continue among us.

I Having oftentimes observed many strangers, men wise and learned, who

the beauty and magnificence thereof, were stricken with so great an admiration
and amazement, that they would, and that with open mouth confess, never any
thing which beforetime they had seen, to be thereunto comparable, either in
glory or goodlinesse. Yet was not every one of the^ possessed with the like

quantity of all sorts of merchandise to be brought out of all realms and
countries into this City, and hence again to be conveyed into so many
strange and far distant nations, both by land and sea. Others exceedingly
admired the wonderful concourse of strange and foreign people, yea of the
farthest and the remotest nations, as though the City of Venice only were a
common and general market to the whole world. Others were astonished at the
greatness of the empire thereunto belonging, and the mightiness of their
state both by land and sea: but the greater part of the most wise and judicial
sort were rather in themselves confounded with amazement at the new and strange
manner of the situation of this City, so fit and convenient for all things,
that it seemed unto them a thing rather framed by the hands of the immortal
Gods, then any way by the art* industry, or invention of men. And for this
only cause deemed the City of Venice to excel all those, that in this age
are to be found, or at any time ever were. Neither altogether without reason,
for surely if you look into former ages, and likewise into this wherein we
live, you shall hardly find any city comparable with this of ours, either for
greatness of Empire, frequencie of people, or abundance and magnificence of
things. But No city either now or in any other age co^parable in all points
with the city of Venice.
especially for situation, never was there since the memory of men, any city
seated in so opportune a place, so secure, and exceeding the belief of men.
Some in building of Cities, imagined they had well and sufficiently done, if
they had chosen a place hard of access, or difficult for their enemies to
besiege or assault the same: whereby it comes, that sundry Cities are seated
on the tops of high hills, with sharp and uneasy passages, or else in
moorish and fennish places: some again for other diverse respects have imagined
nothing to be preferred before an apt and commodious seat, fit to conuoy in
and out all such things as appertain to the making of a City plentiful and
magnificent, as well in matters of necessity, as delicacie. Of which both
points jointly you shall find few that have been careful, fewer that have
attempted it, but unless I be deceived, never any one that has in all points
accomplished it.

But the situation of Venice being rather to be attributed to some divine
providence, then to any humane industry, is (beyond the belief of all those
that have not seen this city) not only most safe and secure, both by land
and sea from all violence, but also in the highest degree opportune and
commodious to the abundance of all things that are behoouefull to the
citizens, as also for traffic of all sorts of merchandise, in manner with
all nations of the world.

The situation of the city of Venice.
For it is seated in a remote and secret place of the Adriatike sea, where on
that side (where the sea beholds the continent) there are mighty great
lakes; fortified with an admirable artifice of nature. For twelve miles off
from the continent, the sea begins to be shallow: and among those flats and
lakes there arises up a shore or bank like unto a hill, which serving as a
fortress against the waves and violences of the sea, makes all the inward
harbor (being very wide and spacious) so secure, that not only the vehemence
of the sea, when through the rage of any tempest it arises, is repressed and
kept back, but also the ships that arrive, are debarred of free and easy
entrance, in so much that if they be not of very light burden, they are forced
to cast anchor at the mouth of the passages or entries, and thence, when the
weather is calm and quiet, being guided by skillful pilots, or rather by
certain particular men experimented in those shallowes and channels, they may
at length come unto the city by a narrow, crooked and intricate way, where
the water is of greater depth, the same in a manner every day altering and
changing according to the tides of the sea.

The bank which arises behind these shallowes, reaches almost threescore
miles, and incloseth the lakes within. Nevertheless the same is not so entire,
but that there is a rupture in seven places thereof, which makes an entry to
the road within, and it is six miles off from the Continent.

In this manner therefore are the lakes of the City of Venice enclosed, partly
with firm ground, partly with Ryalta.
this bank and shallowes: in middle of the which, in that place, which of our
ancestors was called Rialta, and as yet retains the name, was the City of
Venice builded, at such time as the Hunnes under the conduct The cause of the
first building of the City of Venice
of Atyla did spoil with fire and sword the territory of Venetia, a noble
province of Italy, which bordered upon those lakes: in which calamitous time
the citizens of Padua, of Aquilea, of VderZo, of Concordia, and of Altina,
being all fair and goodly cities of Venetia, such of them as were chief in
riches, and nobility, did first get themselves with their families into
certain Islands, or rather little hills, which did appear out somewhat above
the sea, and there built them places of abode, in which as in a secure haven
they avoided the ragefull tempest of the Hunnes.

There were likewise in that troublesome season certain castles built upon the
bank, of which I made mention, to which the inhabitants of that coast
repaired, leaning their ancient homes spoiled and ruined by the Hunnes, seeking
there a safe abode for their wives and children, and as I may say for their
household Gods.

Afterward in the times of the kings, Charles and Pepin, all such as
scatteringly inhabited these places, by common consent retired themselves unto
the Ryalta, as into a place of greater security, and much more commocious then
any of the rest: so that in the end by the concourse of such as could avoid
the ruins of Italy, wrought by the cruelty of barbarous nations, Venice by
degrees augmented it self into that greatness, in which we now do see it.

It is manifest therefore, that the seat of this City must needs be
exceedingly secure, in regard that the first building thereof was undertaken
by men, who to avoid the calamities of Italy, in midst of so great a misery,
remained there in most sound and quiet safety with their Venice has remained
untouched from the violence of any enemy since the first building there of,
which is above 1100* years.
families. But which is more, since those times (which we have not read has
happened to any other city) from the first building thereof, even until this
time, being now a thousand and one hundred years, it has preserved it self
free and untouched from the violence of any enemy, though being most opulent
and furnished, as well of gold and silver, as of all other things that might,
yea even from the farthest parts of the world allure the Barbares to so rich a
booty and spoil. So that I do not disalow their opinion, that have deemed
the City of Venice, to excel and go beyond all other Cities. But yet there is
one thing more in this city, which not only in my judgment far exceeds
all those things, which we have spoken of, but likewise in all their
opinions, that do not account a City to be the walls and houses only, but
rather the assembly and order of the citizens, chiefly and with greatest
worthiness to challenge that name, and this is the true reason, manner, and
form of commonwealthes, through which men enjoy a happy and quiet life: This
is that rare and excellent thing, wherein Venice seems to shine, and to
surpass all antiquity, for though it is apparent that there has been many
commonwealthes, which have far exceeded Venice as well in empire and
greatness of estate, as in military discipline and glory of the wars: yet
has there not been any, that may be paragond with this of ours, for
institutions and laws prudently decreed, to establish unto the inhabitants a
happy and prosperous felicity, the proof whereof is made manifest by the
long continuance thereof in such security and happiness, which when I consider
with my self, I am wont greatly to wonder at the wisdom of our ancestors, at
their industry, the virtue of their minds, and their incredible love and
charity toward their country. There were in Athens, Lacedaemon and Rome, in
sundry seasons sundry rare and virtuous men of excellent desert, and singular
piety toward their country, but so few, that being ouerruled by the
multitude they were not able much to profit the same. But our ancestors, from
whom we have received so flourishing a commonwealth, all in one did unite
themselves in a consenting The nobility of Venice not so ambitious of their
own as of their countries honor.
desire to establish, honor, and amplify their country, without having in a
manner any the least regard of their own private glory or commodity. And
this any man may easily conjecture, that the nobility of Venice was never so
ambitious of any private matter pertaining to themselves, as they were always
infinitely zealous of the honor, commodity and advancement of their country,
in regard that there are in Venice to be found none, or very few monuments of
our ancestors, though both at home and abroad many things were by them
gloriously achieved, and they of passing and singular desert toward their
country. There are no stately ^ecchi di naui
tombs erected, no military statues remaining, no stemmes of ships, no
ensigns, no standrads taken from their enemies, after the victory of many and
mighty battles.

Andreas Contareno Duke of Venice.
I will among innumerable others touch only the example of Andraeas Contareno
an ancestor of mine: who being prince of our commonwealth in the Genowes war,
the greatest and most dangerous that ever we endured, did not only preserve
our country with his singular wisdom, and marvelous greatness of courage,
but did so utterly overthrow our enemies (they triumphing even then as it were
in an assured victory) that they in a manner were all either slain or taken
prisoners. Finally, having so mightily preserved his country, and amplified and
established the commonwealth, he passed out of this life, or dayning by
testament, that on his sepulcher (which at this day is to be seen in S.
Stephens church) there should not be placed any arms or ensigns of our
family: neither, which is more, is there so much as the name of so great a
Duke engraued, but rather by his modesty is it come to pass, that the
sepulcher of so famous and excellent a prince is in a manner utterly unknown.

I imagine this to be a most certain argument, that our ancestors delighted
not in vaineglorie or ambition, but had only their intentive care to the good
of their country and common profit. With this then exceeding virtue of mind
did our ancestors plant and settle this such a commonwealth, that since the
memory of men, whosoever shall go about to make compare between the same and the
noblest of the ancients, shall scarcely find any such: but rather I dare
affirm, that in the discourses of those great Philosophers, which fashioned
and forged co^monwealths according to the desires of the mind, there is not any
to be found so well feigned and framed, for which cause I thought I should do
a thing very grateful to strangers, if I should describe the order of so
renowned a commonwealth: especially because in this time among the number of so
many men learned, and of pregnant wits, ripe in the knowledge of all things,
and excelling in eloquence, I see not any that has undertaken this honorable
task. To which though I know the weakness of our style cannot yield any
ornament, yet the same is of it self so noble, that it is able not only to
yield dignity to it self, but also to the unworthiness of my speech.

Being therefore determined to write of this our commonwealth, to the end that
every one may know whether the same be well or ill disposed, I think it best
to take my beginning from hence.

That man is by nature made a civil creature, but alone by himself, neither
able to live well, not to live at all, which every days necessity, and the
manner of victuailing and clothing approves: and for this cause even from the
beginning did men enter into civil society, and therein continued to the
end, that so they might live happily and commodiously, which is, that with
mutual help and diligence they might obtain the chief good incident to men,
so long as the course of this their mortal life endures, whereunto the whole
reason of civil institution pertains, that by the easiest way No life happy
and blessed but that which contains in it the use of virtue.
possible the citizens may be made possessors of a happy life. But a life happy
and blessed is so termed of great Philosophers, the which contains in it
self the use of virtue, which they do approve with most assured reasons and
undeniable arguments. Now the use of virtue appears as well in the offices of
war, as in the functions of peace: which notwithstanding though the praise of
war, and the manner of discipline thereunto belonging, be necessary to a
City, for the preservation of the liberty and defense of the confines, and
contains in it self great dignity and goodlinesse: yet the common sense of
men does not allow these offices of war (by which the ruin and slaughter of
mankind is procured) to be for themselves desired, and that all other civil
offices should be thereunto referred: for it were the token of an uncivil
disposition, or rather of a man hating humanity to wish for wars,
slaughters, and burnings, for this only cause that he might be famous in
matters of war, and add thereunto (if it please you) that he might be
honored with the name of a great captain: wherefore all philosophers of
greatest mark have War is to be desired for the cause of peace.
in this one point agreed, that war is to be desired for the cause of peace,
and that the whole function of military virtue, and the commendation thereof
ought to be referred to the offices of peace: wherefore that governor of a
commonwealth that would be accounted worthy of praise, and (as the saying is) a
man perfectly accomplished, ought to use that temperature, and to maintain
that order, that the whole commonwealth may seem accommodated to virtue, and
withal, that it be rather thought to attend to the exercises of peace, then
to the offices of war, yet in the mean time not contemning such things as
pertain to the discipline of wars; because many times the militare virtue
(so that the same be used without injury) is necessary to defend and to
enlarge the confines. But things being once ordered as we have said, it is wont
then to be doubted of, whether it be better that one or few have the
government of the whole city, or rather the whole multitude, as many do
describe the estate of that, which ought properly to be called a commonwealth.
And truly to me it seems exceedingly well and wisely said of them, Howsoever
the success has allowed the government of Venice, either in regard of the
smalnesse of their territory, or the strong situation of their city: yet there
was never any example of any other great commonwealth but that did soon perish
by the plurality of comma^ders: all great philosophers chiefly extolling the
monarchy; and all course of times and examples confirming their opinion.
that deemed the government of men to be unfitly granted to one alone, but
that there should be a thing more divine to whom this office should be given,
as out of many sorts of creatures may be gathered. For a sheep governs not a
flock of sheep, nor an ox, nor an horse a heard of oxen, or horses; but a
creature more excellent defends and governs them, which is man, which is a
thing manifest to al men, of how much more worth he is then those brute
creatures: by the like reason (if so it might be brought to pass) should man
be governed by some thing more divine and excellent the^ man, but seeing in
worldly things (which are with sense perceived) there is nothing found more
excellent the^ man, and man being a certain diverse creature, and consisting
of different parts, as having the inferior forces of his mind common, as it
were with brutish creatures: but with the superior powers thereof, participating
(in a manner) with the immortal Gods: that rightly ought amongst men to obtain
the place of government and rule, which is in man highest and of greatest
participation with dignity: which is as all men do acknowledge the mind, being
by nature grafted in us as a beam of the heavenly brightness: therefore evil
shall that commonwealth be provided for, that That ought amongst men to obtain
the place of government and rule, which is in man highest, and of greatest
participation with divinity.
shall be committed to the government of a man, whom many times those inferior
and brutish powers do perturbe, and call back from the true path of reason:
but that office is rather to be committed to the mind, pure and void of
perturbations: wherefore by a certain divine counsel when by other means it
might not, mankind through the invention of laws seems to have attained
this point, that this office of governing assemblings of men should be given to
the mind and reason only: the same being free from passion, which among many
other the infinite blessings and gifts of heaven, is not to be accounted in the
lowest, but rather the highest rank, if we will truly consider the utility
of laws: for first in enacting them, many wise men meet together, who by long
use grown skillful in many things, by comparing the inventions and examples of
others with their own experience, do at length after long consultation
determine that which shall seem best unto them, their minds being then
directly bent to virtue, free from hatred, friendship, or other perturbation:
the cause of no The excellency of laws.
private man being interessed in the establishing of laws, which in courses of
man's judgment often happens. But after that laws once are enacted, if any
then transgress them, and chance to suffer the punishments that they inflict,
he cannot in reason blame any man, and in this case it is not to be feared that
any sedition or rancor grown among the citizens, being the greatest and most
dangerous contagion of co^monwealths: whereas contrariwise when any man is
punished by the judgment of men not fortified with laws, great and grievous
enmities do sundry times ensue; for it scarcely can be chosen, but that we
remain ill affected toward him, of whom we have received harm, so that I
cannot well resolve whether mankind be more beholding for any other The
invention of laws was by the ancients, consecrated unto the immortal Gods.
thing to nature the mother of all things, then it is for this invention of
laws, which was of the ancients and not unworthily consecrated to the
immortal Gods: but which serves more marvelous, Aristotle ptince of
philosophers, in that book of the world which he did dedicat to great
Alexander, found not any thing to which he might likelier resemble God, the^ to
an autentike law in a City rightly governed: so that the opinion of this great
philosopher was in manner, that God was the same in the university of things,
as an ancient law in a civil company: and in his books wherein he
entreats of a commonwealth, he terms law to be a mind without appetite,
which is to say pure, clear, and free from the infirmity of any passion,
whereby any man, of how slow conceit soever, may perceive the fitness and
necessity of that of which we spoke before: that is, that something more
divine then man should rule and govern the companies of men: for a man being
advanced to this office of government, (as men endued with wisdom, and
integrity are rare) and they for the most part may err in judging and
decerning things through the force of their affections, which do perturbe and
divert the mind from her true course and intention, it follows of necessity,
that things cannot go so current as they should, yea though it might be so,
that we might find out a man so wise and virtuous, and of such steadfast
constancic, that no perturbation were able to make his mind recoile from his
duty, yet neither on this condition were the rule of man to be wished for
before the government of laws: for he being of a mortal and frail nature
could not long enjoy that function, when laws (as I said) do in a manner
concur with eternity. By these I think it sufficiently persuaded, that the
souerainty of government should be recommended not to men but to laws, to
whose will yet some few things may be permitted, that are not well in laws to
be comprehended: nevertheless it is necessary, that there be A Guardian of
the laws.
made a certain Guardian as Liestenant and minister of the laws, who may govern
the commonwealth according to the rule of the laws. And because all those
things that come into judgment cannot be comprehended in laws, that he then
be an arbiter and ruler of those matters that are in question: now again
returns that controversy of constitution of laws, which Whether a few or
the whole multitude be to be preferred to the defense of of the laws.
to some might seem already decided, that is to say, whether one, or a few, or
the whole multitude, be to be preferred to the defense of the laws, and to
judge those things that do not fall into the comprehension of laws. And though
in the opinion of many men, the kingly domination is of highest esteem and
greatest account: nevertheless I should think that though the principality
of one alone, that should lawfully, and by right challenge to himself the
dignity of a king: if the matter be by it self considered, should seem of
all other the best, yet in regard of the brevity of life, and man's frail
disposition, which for the most part enclineth to the worser part, the
government of the multitude is far more convenient to the assembly of
citizens, which experience the mistress of all things does elegantly teach
us, because that we have not read that there was among auncientes any
souerainty of a king, neither have we in our time seen any that had not soon
declyned into tyranny: on the contrary side many commonwealthes that have
continued prosperously many ages, and flourished both in peace and war, yet
is the whole multitude of it self unapt to govern, unless the same be in
some sort combined together; for No civil society can remain perfect, unless
the same be in a unity contained.
there cannot be a multitude without the same be in some unity contained; so
that the civil society (which consists in a certain unity) will be
dissolved, if the multitude become not one by some mean of reason, so that the
best philosophers, and those that have learnedlyest written of the ordering of
a commonwealth, judged that in the government thereof there should be a
temperature between the state of nobility and popular sort, to the end that
the inconveniences of either gouernmental one might be avoided, and the
commodities of both jointly inioyed, for which cause they do highly The
commonwealth of the Lacedaemonians governed by the king, the Ephores and the
Senate. The same wholly instituted to the offices and exercises of war.
commend the commonwealth of the Lacedaemonians, in which the kings, the Ephores,
and the senates made a certain mixture, so that it is hard to decipher under
what sort of government the same can be placed: only this they reprehend, that
it was only instituted to the offices of war without any regard of the offices
of peace and quietness, whereby it came to pass, that the same being glorious,
and renowned in many excellent virtues so soon as ever it began to live at
quiet, presently declined, and at length utterly fell to ruin: which also and
for the same cause befell the Romans, neither was the event thereof
vnforeseene of sundry of the chief Senators, The cause of the ruin of the
Lacedemonian and Roman commonwealth.
among the which Nasica was of opinion, that Carthage (though envious of the
Roman greatness, and as it were in competencie withal) ought not to have
been ruined, to the end that Rome might still have an enemy with whom to
occupy it self in arms: lest their enemy and corriuall being taken away,
the commonwealth being instituted to war, and the youth nourished in arms,
they should turn their weapons upon themselves, which counsel of Nasica
though it was then refused of the Senates, and the contrary decreed:
nevertheless the eue^t proved the same to have bin most wise and prudent: for
Carthage being destroyed, presently (in a manner) they burst out into civil
wars through which at length the same being the most flourishing and mighty
commonwealth that ever was, fell down to the ground, and that City abounding
in such opulency, as being in manner Queen of the world, became a pray to the
barbarous. But to come now at length to our determined task, it appears that
our ancestors, which instituted the commonwealth of Venice, were men endued
with admirable wisdom and virtue, in that they omitted nothing which might
seem to pertain to the right institution of a commonwealth: for first they
ordained the whole life and exercise of their citizens to the use and office of
virtue, and always with greater regard and reckoning applied their minds to
the maintenance of peace then to glory of wars: The Venetians applied their
minds, more to the maintenance of peace then to the glory of wars.
bending always their chiefest care and study to the preservation of civil
concord and agreement among themselves, not in the mean time neglecting
warlike offices, such (I mean) as were fit and convenient for our City, of
which the situation is such, that it serves well, and is commodious for wars
by sea, but unfit for wars by land: for neither squadrons of horsemen, nor
troops of footmen can by any means be accomodated thereunto, as by my former
description, thereof may easily be coniectured. Besides, they used such a
moderation and temperature, and such a mixture of all estates, that this only
city retayneth a princely sovereignty, a government of the nobility, and a
popular authority, so that the forms of them all seem to be equally
balanced, as it were with a pair of weights, as more plainly hereafter shall
appear.

But now finally to come to the institution of our Venetian commonwealth, the
whole authority of the city from whose decrees and laws as well the senate as
all other The great council in which consifteth the whole authority of the
commonwealth of Venice.
magistrates derive their power and authority, is in that council, into which
all the gentlemen of the City being once past the age of 25. years, are
admitted: and sundry of them not yet come to that age, so that they be full
twenty, which privilege they obtain by the benefit of lottes: of which
hereafter we will discourse the whole manner: Now first I am to yield you a
reckoning how and with what wisdom it was ordained by our ancestors, that
the common people should not be admitted into this company of citizens, in
whose authority consists the whole power of the common wealth, then that this
definition of citizens was not with less wisdom measured, rather by the
nobility of lineage, then the greatness of wealth, as in ancient commonwealthes
it was wont, and as many old philosophers do prescribe: for though the city is
the company of citizens: yet all those men whose travail the City needs,
yea and that dwell within the walls thereof, are not generally to be reckoned
in the number, nor registered in the right of citizens: for every city stands
in need of artificers, and many mercenarie people, and hired servants, of
which none can be truly termed a citizen: for a citizen is a free man, but
those are all servile, either privately or publicly: for mercenarie men
Mercenary men and artificers to be held as public servants.
and artificers, are all to be accounted as public servants: for it is to be
believed that a living creature is not otherwise made of nature, then it is
needful that the city should be of men: for as in a living creature are
many parts that have no life, yet the creature needs them toward the
maintenance of life: so in a company of citizens, there is a necessary use of
many men, who nevertheless ought neither to be, nor to be reputed or placed
in the number of citizens: for which cause it was wisely ordained of our
ancestors, that the whole people should not have power in this commonwealth,
which they desired to fashion in the highest degree of perfection. Because many
troubles and popular tumults arise in those cities, whose government is swaied
by the common people, which we have also read, has been observed in sundry
commonwealthes, and also delivered in way of precept by many and great
philosophers, yet many were of contrary opinion, deeming that it would do
well, if this manner of governing the commonwealth should rather be defined by
ability and abundance of riches: but here again they fell into great
absurdities The absurdity of those that elect the rulers and magistrates of
their commonwealth by the abundance of their riches.
and no small inconveniences: for it happens often that those of the basest
sort, yea of the very skum of the people, do scrape together great wealth, as
those that apply themselves to filthy arts, and illiberall occupations, never
sparing the toilesome and careful wearing out of their lives, but with an
intolerable saving, defrauding themselves of the comforts of life, thereby to
increase their substance. Contrariwise the honest citizens, and those that are
liberally brought up, oftentimes fall to poverty, either (as it often
happens) by adverse fortune, or else that being wholly addicted to noble and
liberal studies, they neglect the increasing of their wealth: whereby it
comes that filthy and ill mannerd men sauouring of nothing but gain, utterly
ignorant of good arts, by little and little come to govern the commonwealth:
and those that are honest and of liberal condition by the decay of their
substance, do loose the right of citizens, whereby of necessity there must arise
great seditions and troubles to the commonwealth. Therefore our wise and
prudent ancestors, lest their commonwealth should happen into these calamities,
ordered that this definition of the public rule, Nobility of lineage to be in
election of magistrates preferred before riches.
should go rather by the nobility of lineage, then by the estimation of wealth:
yet with that temperature, that men of chief and supreme nobility should not
have this rule alone (for that would rather have been the power of a few then a
commonwealth) but also every other citizen whosoever not ignobly borne: so that
all which were noble by birth, or enobled by virtue, or well deserving of the
commonwealth, did in the beginning obtain this right of government: which has
likewise happened in these times of ours, yea and some foreign men and
strangers have been adopted into this number of Strangers sometimes adopted
into the right of citizens by the Venetians.
citizens, either in regard of their great nobility, or that they had been
dutiful toward the state, or else had done unto them some notable service.
This whole assembly therefore of the citizens (or as commonly it is termed)

as also the dignity of the senate and of all the magistrates depends)

in this commonwealth the form of a popular state. The Duke who has no time of
government limited unto him, but rules during life, bears the show of a
kingly power, representing in all things the glory, gravity and dignity of a
king: the rest of the citizens do bear him honor and reverence as unto a king:
and all decrees, laws, and public letters go forth under his name. But the
Senate, the ten, the college of elders or chief counselors, which amongst
us of the common people are commonly called the sages: those I say which do
consult of matters, and after from the commonwealth do make report unto the
Senate, carry with them a certain show of an Aristocracy or government of the
nobility: which seeing they are the chief parts of this commonwealth, before
we come to the meaner magistrates; we will speak particularly of these. We will
take our beginning from the greater council, upon which the whole commonwealth
depends.

All young men of the nobility, which have accomplished Young Gentlemen at 20.

the age of 20. years, do go unto the office which commonly is called
aduocatory, to which the defense of the laws chiefly belongs: before which
presenting themselves with their father, or with their mother: if he be dead,
or in case of both their wants, with some near kinseman, they do prove with
the witness besides of two honest men (neither of them being of the mothers
kindred) themselves to be borne of that father whom they allege, not bastards,
but in lawful matrimony, and that their mother lived in fame of an honest
woman. The witnesses swear in this manner, that they do manifestly know it by
the report and consent of An oath taken in the behalf of the young gentlemen
before they are admitted into the council.
al those that know them. Then the father or the mother or (they both wanting)
the kinsemen affirm with the oath, that the young man has passed his 20.
years: which things after they are directly registered by the clearke of the
office, they then attend the fourth day of the month of December. on which day
the names of all these young men that have not yet by lotte obtained the right
of citizens, nor are not passed 25. years old, are put into a pot, and carried
unto the prince, and there the same set before the counselors, with which
there is another pot, wherein are round balls equal with the number of the
names written in the first, every one having his marks; the fifth part of these
balls is gilded with gold, the rest with silver: the prince takes out of the
first pot the name, and then out of the next pot the ball, which if he be
of the golden sort, the young man whose name was drawn, has presently the
authority of public power, and is admitted into the great counsel, but if it
be of the siluered, he leeseth for that time his right, and expects his
fortune of the year to come, unless in the mean time he accomplish the 25.
year of his age: for every gentleman coming to that age has presently the
right of a citizen, and is made pertaker of the public authority, by this
means the fifth part of the noble young men, that put themselves to this trial,
is every year admitted and enabled to give his voice with the other citizens:
but if it so happen that the father or grandfather of any gentleman, either in
regard of absence or other cause, had never used this public right, nor his
name never been registered in the common book, that contains the names of
all the nobility (lest there should be any fraud used, or lest any bastard
should under hand enter into this company of No bastard admitted for noble.
gentlemen) they would not that this matter should be judged and determined of
only by the office of the aduocatory magistrates, but it is provided for by a
law, that they should prove their nobility by witnesses and public writings,
and that the aduocators should make The counsel of the ^.
report over to the forty men, and so the cause being understood and thoroughly
examined and debated of by the forty men, it is at length judged whether the
party pretending is to be admitted for noble or no.

But to the end that no one should scotfree adventure the trial of this
judgment, it was also provided, that whosoever should undertake this proof of
his nobility, should first bring unto the magistrate five hundred crowns of
gold, by them to be put into the treasure, in case the pretendant speed not in
his suit. Such was the diligence of our ancestors, to the end that this
congregation of nobility should no way be defiled. For which cause those very
citizens which are nobly borne, and have past their 25. years, obtain not yet
the authority of giving their voices, till being so presented before the
magistrates, they prove the accomplishment of the age by the oath of their
father, mother, or near kinseman, and also by two witnesses, that they were
born of that gentleman, who they say was their father, not bastards, nor of a
mother any way reproched.

Now that we have expressed the whole manner by which the citizens do enter
into the public authority, I think it worthy to be marked, that our
ancestors did deem it a thing of great moment for the maintenance of the
citizens in unity and love, if they did often meet and assemble together.
Therefore as well by laws as by prescription of time, it is an ancient custom
that this The great counsel assembled every eight day.
great counsel should be assembled every eight day, and sometimes oftener. The
especial office of which is to create all the magistrates: as well those that
administer justice in the city, and enjoy other offices in the commonwealth,
as the senate, the ten, the Pretors, the Captains and treasurers of castles
and Cities, which are under the fellowship of the Venetian empire, as also the
governors of sortresses, the General of their navy, their ambassadors,
captains of their galleys, and finally to conclude all in a word, all those
whosoever abroad or at home, have charge under the commonwealth. Likewise all
such laws as pertain to the constitution of the commonwealth, are enacted by
the authority of this council, which is especially used to be done when the
Duke is dead, there being no new successor as yet created. But this shall be
spoken of more hereafter.

Now we will express the whole manner of creating The order of the Session
house.
magistrates. Every holliday in manner about noone this great council is
assembled into a great and spacious Ten very long benches in the hall where the
great council is kept.
hall, which we will call the Session house. There are in the same ten exceeding
long benches, equalling in manner the length of the hall: the citizens sit
down every one when they come, where it pleases them, for there is no place
appointed to any, except to some Magistrates of chief authority, as the Duke,
the Counselors, and the three presidents of the forty, which sit on a higher
seat, and only have authority to make report over to the great Council.
After these the Aduocatory magistrates, and the three heads of the ten sit
down in their appointed places, in the midst of certain benches, that are
also somewhat higher then the rest, and are close adjoining to the wall of the
hall, and at length very far from the Duke are the seats of the old and new
auditors, of whom we will speak more hereafter. But the rest of the citizens
(as I said) sit down without any place appointed where it pleases them. Then
at an appointed hour the doors of the Session house are shut fast, and the
keys brought to the Tribunal of the prince, and there laid at his feet. Then
the chief Chauncellor (which though it be not an honor of the nobility, yet
it is of very great dignity) stands up, and from a high eminent place
declares what rooms and offices are vacant, and then to be provided for*
which being pronounced, he passes straight from that place to the Tribunal of
the Prince, and there with a loud voice cites the Magistrates being
Presidentes of the sessions (as is said before) that they should come to the
Prince, or to the Counselors if the prince be away. They being summoned do
presently come, and there with oath do promise to do their uttermost diligence,
that the laws may be observed, and that they will not in these offices
pronounce any citizen, that shall any way have violated the decrees, but that
they will cause such a one to be severely punished, according to the rigor of
the laws: which ceremony being ended, every one returns to his place except
one of the aduocators, and one of the heads of the ten, which go to the
farthest part of the hall right opposite against the princes seat, and there
sit down in appointed places. The other aduocators sit down on the right
fide of the session house: and the other heads of the ten right over against
them on the left side. In like manner do the old and new auditors place
themselves in the farthest seat of the hall (which as I said, is far distant
from the place of the prince) some on the right hand, and some on the left, to
the end, as it should seem, that by this manner seating themselves, they
should serve (as it were) for gards or watchmen to this great assembly, least
any thing should there happen to be done unespied or unpunished, against the
laws or order of the Sessions. The Magistrates then being in this manner
placed, there are brought before the tribunal The manner of choosing their
electors,
of the prince 3. pots, having in them little bals, some of gold, and some of
silver: one of the which is placed in the midst of the Tribunal seat, and
the other two at each end one, in either of which there are infinite balls of
silver, but only thirty of gold, but in the middle pot, there are not
above threescore balls in all, of which six and thirty are of gold, and the
other four and twenty of silver, and the golden balls are all marked with
certain letters, which they bring forth every sessions by lot, least otherwise
there might be deceit used. The pottes being placed, three of the youngest
counselors arise from their seats, and sit down on the lowest place of the
Tribunal, by the three pottes, every counselor by a several pot. This being
thus done and ordered, then that rank of citizens, whose lot comes forth,
rises presently on either part of the session house: for throughout the
length of the hall, are placed ten ranks of benches, in which (as I said
before) the citizens sit as pleases them: to two of which ranks one lot
only serves, that is to say, to those that on either side of the hall are
opposite one to the other. This rank then whose lotte is drawn, is called by
the crier with a high voice, which rank, and that which respondeth to it on
the other side of the hall, presently arises, and the citizens in order as
they sat, go unto those pots which the counselors have charge of, near unto
the princes seat, and each of them putting in his hand takes out a ball,
which if it be of silver, he returns by a contrary way to the seat whence
he came: if it be of gold, he shows it to the Counselor, who has the
charge of that pot, to be viewed if it be of the right mark.

This manner of mark was ordained, least some one otherwise might bring with
him a golden ball, which holding privily in his hand, he might seem to have
drawn out of the pot, and so by fraud obtain the place of an Elector. He
then to whose lotte befalls one of these golden balls, goes straight to the
middle pot, and draws out another ball, which if it be of filuer, he
returns whence he came, loosing for that time his voice of election: but if
it be of gold he ascends the Tribunal, and sits down on the princes side
in a place appointed him. The second that shall have the like lot goes also
to the same place, and likewise the third, and so the others until they be
nine in all, which makes complete the first number, who are in that rank
placed in order, without respect of any thing, save only of their age. Here it
is not to be forgotten, that those who by this benefit of lot are made
electors, are presently in a loud voice proclaimed by the Chancellor in such
sort, that the whole assembly hears him: after which no one of his near
kinsemen or alliance may by any means attempt this lot of making himself
Elector: neither may there any more then two of one family be admitted to stand
for the electorshippe: which was with great wisdom ordained of our
ancestors, to the end that this honor of election might stretch to many
families, and this public benefit be largely extended among the citizens, for
of reason it ought to suffice if the lot fauouringtwo of one family make them
pertakers of public authority. But to return from whence I have digressed,
so soon as this first number of the nine electors is complete, they The manner
of the choice of magistrates made by the Electors.
go presently out of the Session house into a divided inner room, where also is
present a Secretary of the commonwealth, who relates to the Electors those
things that are by the laws ordained, and what they are to observe in their
election of Magistrates. Likewise he reads unto them the decrees of the
senate, and other laws, by which it is defended, that the Electors shall not
by any means suffer themselves to be bribed or corrupted with money, nor use
in their election any fraud or deceit. This being done the nine Electors are
placed in seats, every one according to his age, the eldest in the highest and
worthiest place: for the Venetians will not allow among their citizens any
other difference, then only of age, because from thence never sprang any
sedition nor contention: neither is the same omitted of those great
philosophers. Aristotle (I say) in his Politiques, and Zenophon in that famous
work of his, of the institution of Cyrus King of Persia. The Electors thus
placed, there are then nine little bals thrown into a pot, each of them
marked with his number from the first to the ninth: and in a scroll somewhat
long are written the magistracies in order that are in this session to be
provided for. The eldest of the electors first puts in his hand into the
pot, and takes out a ball, according to the number with which the same is
marked, he has authority to name what citizen he will in the same
magistracy, which is in the scroll by the said number deciphered. So is it with
the second, third, and likewise the rest, so that every Elector by the benefit
of lot is made the pronouncer of a particular magistrate. After that he, to
whom the lot of the first magistrate happens, has pronounced the citizen,
that to him seems Six of the 9. voices confirms the elected citizen.
good, the 9. electors go to voices, of which if the elected have 6. of his side
of that number of the 9. electors, then he is presently entitled in the
magistracy, and his name recorded in the long scroll, in which are written all
those magistracies for which these sessions are called, but if he have fewer
then six voices (which seldom happens) then is there another named of the
same elector, and so forward still, until in the end one be named, of whom
six of the electors shall allow: the self same manner is observed in the
second, third, and all the rest, until the number of those 9. electors have
every one in particular chosen a particular magistrate: while these things are
in handling in the inner divided room, the other citizens in the session house
keep on their course in drawing of lots as they began, and going to the pottes
accordingly, as by lot it falls to their ranks, they draw out bals, until 9.
others have out of either pot drawn a golden lot. These fill up the second row
of electors, and they also (according unto the degrees of their age) are placed
in the conclaue, or divided room: where they find an other chancellor or
secretary, who without differing one jot from the former, recites unto them
the decrees of the senate, which they are to observe, and brings forth to the
self same magistrates a scroll of the self same order as the other was, which
was brought to the first order of electors in the conclaue: and so then the
lots again are drawn of the electors, and as every one draws, so according
to the number and order aforesaid does each of them pronounce a particular
citizen in that magistracy, which the number of his lot assigns him. And in
like manner the other third 9. observe the aforesaid ceremonies from point to
point: and so likewise the fourth 9. so that in all they fill up the number of
36. citizens, for so many were the golden bals that were in the pot in the
middle seat: so that of 60. citizens which drew out the first 60. golden balls
36. do become electors, and are divided into 4. ranks: but the twenty four
which drew the silver balls out of the middle pot, frustrated of their hope,
return them to their seats. I know how difficill a thing it is by writing to
set down these small particularities, being so far different from the use of
the ancient Romans: but I had rather be blamed for folly, then for want of
diligence, for I will not willingly pass over the smallest thing, without
making mention of it: so that none how curious soever, may in reason desire any
more at my hands. But to return where I left, there is then in every office,
(for which that day the sessions are appointed) by the four orders of
Electors, four citizens chosen, I mean by every particular order of electors a
particular citizen, unless it happen some one self man to be named of two
The choice of the competitors.
or three of the orders of the electors (which sometimes happens) but for the
most part there are of every office or Magistracy four competitors, though in
some of less dignity, and mark there are only two, of which inferior
offices the two first orders of electors have power to choose and name the
competitors, of which privilege and jurisdiction the two later orders are
frustrated and deprived: but so soon as the competitors of all the offices are
chosen, presently the electors are dismissed, neither may they that day give
their voice more to any one, neither be so much as present at the sessions:
And then the chief secretary (which honor as I said, may not be given to a
gentleman, and yet nevertheless is of great dignity and sway) with a high
voice pronounces from his seat the competitors of the first magistracy, and
particularly relates who is chosen, and of what order of the electors. Neither
omitteth he which of the electors was the first author of naming him. In which
place me thinks it ought not to be let slip, how that it is by law
established, that the same elector (who is the author of the pronunciation, The
Elector becomes surety for him whom be pronounces.
and choice of any competitor) is reckened to be in manner as a surety for him:
for afterward having gone beyond his competitors, and obtained the desired
office, if he then chance to convert to himself any of the public treasure,
or goods, and be thereof convicted, and withal remain unable to make
satisfaction, then that elector by whose authority he was created and
pronounced, is bound out of his own substance to pay the same to the treasure
house, The competitors of the first magistracy being then pronounced by the
chief secretary in a high voice, presently after they are named if they be
then present, every one with his parentage, and dearest friends and kinsfolk
goes out of the session house, into an appointed conclaue or inner room, and
there stay until the magistracy be determined of. Then again after all this,
the chief secretary admonishes them all that they are bound both by divine
and humane laws, without any regard of private commodity, to favor and
assist him whom they shall think fittest for the honor and commodity of the
commonwealth. Then he names the first competitor, that is, he which was chosen
of the first order of electors: for whom lottes are to be tried. Then
presently rise up so many young men, as will serve two to every rank of
benches. They carry in their hands certain pottes, made and joined together
with a maruailous kind of artifice; the uttermost part of which is green, and
the interior white, both covered: whereinto when you put your hand, it is in
your choice to let your ball fall into which of the two you please: the manner
of the pottes being so contrived, that no one of those that are present, though
he behold it never so steadfastly, can tell into whether of the two the ball was
put: they do not this with beans, but with certain linen balls, lest that
otherwise by the sound of their fall there might be some conjecture made into
whether of the pots the bal was let fall for our ancestors deemed it to be a
thing most expedient to our commonwealth, that our judgments might be free,
and therefore they took great care, that the suffrages might be secret. The
young men therefore every one with his pots thus joined together go every one to
his own bench, and offer their pottes to every one of the citizens in order as
they sit, who showing every one his ball openly, puts his hand into the
pot, and lets the same fall into whether part he lists. If he will give
his voice in favor, then into the inner white; if otherwise, then into the
uttermost which is green: and this order is used throughout all the benches,
whereby it comes to pass, that in a very small moment of time the whole
assembly of citizens have yielded their suffrages. Then the pots are brought to
the princes seat, and the balls taken out and put into two broad dishes, that
is to say, those which were in the white pot, and in favor into a white dish,
and those which were in the green pot, and in disfavor, into a green dish.
Then they are brought to the counselors (in midst of whom the prince
sits) to be numbered and told: the suffrages of the white dish favoring the
competititor are numbered of those counselors which sit on the right hand of
the prince: the other of the contrary dish and contrary effect, are told by
those counselors which sit on the left hand of the prince: the public
secretaries are present where the counselors are, and do presently write up
the number both of the one and the other balls that are reckoned. In the mean
time while these reckonings are in hand, they begin their suffrages for the
second competitor, which was chosen of the second order of the electors and in
like sort the suffrages are brought to the counselors, which presently are
numbered, and the secretaries register them in writing: the like order is
observed for the third and fourth competitor, if there be so many. All the
suffrages being reckoned up, he that has them most in his favor, so that they
exceed the half is pronounced and chosen of the chief secretary: at such
time as the sessions being ended the council is to be dismissed. But if it so
fall out, that none of the competitors for that magistracy have any more then
the just half of the lots in his favor, then is the whole proceeding held as
void, and the appointment of that office deferred to the next sessions.

After that the first magistracy is in the sessions determined of, then are
the names pronounced of those that are elected in the second, and the
competitors go into the conclaue with their kindred and alliance, and those
that were shut in before (that is to say, the kindred and alliance of the first
competitors) return into the sessions: and the very like order and manner as
in the first do they observe in their suffrages for the competitors of the
second magistracy: which being numbered by the counselors he is held for
elected, that exceeds the rest in number of voices, so that they exceed the
half. The Sessions being ended, the names of the elected are pronounced by the
chief Secretary, and then the whole Council is dismissed: which may The
council may not be prolonged after the setting of the Sun.
not at all be held or prolonged after the sun is once down: so if in that
day they make not an end of all, then do they declare the names of those that
are already chosen: and as for those that remain, there is no reckoning to be
made at all: so that they remain frustrate of the benefit which the
nomination of the Electors had put them in hope of. And this was so ordained
not without great reason, for if the matter should have been prolonged within
night, it would not have been easy for those magistrates that are Presidentes
of the sessions, to contain so great a multitude of citizens in order, but
that through favor of the darkness, they would have attempted somewhat
prejudicial to the laws. Therefore our grave ancestors, men indeed wise and
provident, preventing the inconveniences that thereby might happen with
exceeding carfulness and wisdom, ordained that the sessions should not by
any means be continued after the setting of the Sun; neither would that by
any means that light should be brought into the hall while the sessions
endured. This is the whole manner of the proceeding in the sessions: but by the
way it is to be noted, that the offices are so distributed among the citizens,
that two of one family, kindred, or near alliance, may not by any means have

place in one and the same office; neither in the sessions may two of one
family, or near alliance be by benefit of lotte electors (as I said before)
the same likewise being ordained with great reason and discretion, to the end
that the pre-eminence of public authority might pertain to many, and not be
engrossed up among a few: least thereby through too much greatness of power
might become disturbers or oppressors of the commonwealth: and on the other
side, those that do find themselves void and hopeless of honor and
government, might grow into a dislike and hatred of the same.

The dangerous estate of that government, which many of the citizens do seek
to alter and undermine.
And without doubt it is almost impossible for that commonwealth to maintain
it self afoot, and to stand firm, whose government many of the citizens do
seek to alter or undermine: so that nothing is more proper to a commonwealth,
then that the common authority and power should belong to many: for it is just
that the citizens, by whom the state of the City is maintained, being
otherwise among themselves equal, should not in this distribution of honors
be made unequal. But they that do reduce the public authority into a few
families, do easily fall upon that estate of government, which the Greeks
call Oligarchia. Therefore in the commonwealth of Venice, the offices are so
divided among the citizens, that inso much as may be, every family and kindred
may be pertaker of the public honors and offices, and yet in that measure,
that not every one do govern, but those only that do excel the rest in
honesty and wisdom, and are deemed to be such men, as will more regard the
public, then the private commonditie. That first institution has I know not
what of popular, but the other sauoureth only of the government of the
Nobility: whereby it is manifest that there is in this city of ours an
excellent contrived mixture of the best and iustest governments: for though
upon the first view this great council of ours seem to bear the show of a
popular estate, yet looking well into it, you shall find therein an apparent
entermixture of the government or the nobility. I grant that the election of
The commo^wealth of Venice is neither a popular estate, nor an Olygarchy, but a
well tempered government between both.
magistrates by lot is a matter popular, especially where right and justice is
measured, not by a determinate prudence, but simply by an arithmetical
equality: for considering (say they) that every one is a citizen and freeman,
one as well as another, and that among equalles things ought equally to be
divided, every one ought to be sweetened alike with participation of the
honors and commodities of the commonwealth, without more exclusion of one more
then another: now in regard that all cannot rule at once, but by turns, they
think fit that the matter should be committed merely to lot, and that they
should rule, to whom the same should be favorable. The contrary is alleged
by those, where full power and authority consists in the mightiness of a
few, for they suppose unequal things to belong to unequal persons, and that
therefore mean men should content themselves with a mean and honorlesse
estate, and that the great and highest dignities should belong to them that do
farthest exceed the rest in riches: in which reckoning either of both parties
strayeth far wide from the true and perfect path, though either of them relyeth
upon a reason in appearance seeming true, for whereas the one affirms equal
things to belong to equal persons, and the other that men unequal in riches
should be unequal in government: the first measuring the equality and likeness
only by number, and the other the vnlikelinesse and imparitie only by riches,
they are without doubt both of them besides the cushion: For they that are in
number equal, are in some sort equal, but not wholly, and those that are in
riches unequal, though in some sort unequal, yet are they not wholly to be
accounted unequal: but the institution of a civil life tending chiefly to
live well, it is only virtue that must make this difference. To those then that
do excel the rest in virtue, the chiefest honors are due, as being most
worthy, and above the equality of the rest, and so likewise equal rule and
dignity belongs to those that are in virtue equal, and in civil industry:
and this is the true measure and perfect rule to distinguish men. As therefore
the choice of electors by lot is popular: so does it also savor of a noble and
better government, that they should be chiefliest advanced in honor, that do
chiefliest surmount the rest in virtue, judgment, and counsel, and that the
vnworthier should receive the repulse. Whereby you may plainly perceive, that
in this manner of our government there is mingled with a popular show, the
form of a nobler rule, yet used with such temperature, that the same does not
exceed, nor go beyond the mean and manner of the popular authority. For in
choice of the electors only chance rules; of which dignity the worst and
basest may without hurt or detriment of the commonwealth, be partakers in
equal power with the best and worthiest citizens, but in the essential
distribution of honors and dignities chance has no power at all, the same
being wholly done by a deliberate election and advised judgment. And here me
thinks, I ought not to ouerslip in silence, that in those sessions, which do
concern the bestowing of offices, to which men of the greatest wisdom,
honesty and diligence are required, the senate of it self makes up a fifth
order, to the 4. The senate when any principal office is to be provided for,
has authority to create a fifth competitor.
before expressed orders of electors. For whiles the other electors separated in
conclaues or places appointed for that purpose, do pronounce such to be
competitors, as they shall in their judgments think meet, the^ if so be the
sessions do concern any such especial office, as beforesaid, the senate does
also withdraw it self into an inner chamber, and there every Senator has
power to name such one as he shall please in the office, of which the present
question is: and whosoever shall chance to have most voices in his favor, is
elected in this cabinet of the Senate, and created the fifth Competitor: whereby
it plainly appears, that in this commonwealth of ours the form of an
Aristocracie is much more excellent then the popular government. But the manner
and means of this kind of council is hitherto (unless I be deceived) of us
sufficiently expressed and made plain. Let us now come to that part of the
commonwealth, the which not unlike to a well tuned dyapason in music, where
the base is to the treble aptly proportioned, carrying with it the show of a
Monarchy, has notwithstanding a correspondency with the popular government,
and finally a middle sort of Magistrates being between them both interposed,
does grow (as it were) into a well concenting harmony of an excellent
commonwealth.

The end of the first book.
The Second Book of Venetian Commonwealth and Magistrates.
THe exterior show of the prince in the City of Venice delivers to the eyes
of the beholders the person of a king, and the very resemblance of a monarchy:
Therefore it shall not in my opinion do amiss if having described that assembly
of citizens, which represents the form of a popular estate (though for the
dignity of the matter insufficiently, yet considering the slenderness of our
forces not altogether vndiligently) if we now take upon us to express the
first reason that moved our wise and virtuous ancestors to place one man only
at the helm of their commonwealth, and also when and what was the beginning of
this royal and princely institution. No man (I suppose) is ignorant of that
which is so often of us in this work repeated, which is, that a City is a
certain civil society, sufficing within it self of such things as are
necessary to the leading of a happy and quiet life: and there is no question
to be made, but that every civil society is contained and linked together in
a certain unity, and by distraction and breach of that unity is again as
easily dissolved. For nothing has sooner overthrown the mighty and opulent
estate of many great and glorious cities that hereto fore have perished, then
homebred discord and civil dissension. Now a unity cannot well be contained,
unless one being placed in authority above, not only the vulgar multitude,
but also all the rest of the citizens and officers, have authority to combine
them together, being scattered and disioynted, and to bind them (as it were)
all into one entire body: which the great philosophers that were the searchers
out, and (as it were) diverse into the secrets of Nature, did notably mark and
observe, as well in the constitution of the whole world, as also of this
Microcosme or little world, which is Man. For they well found out, that in
this university of things the many and disagreeing motions of each particular
thing, according to the nature thereof, were all vpheld and maintained under
one heavenly and eternal mouer, and so likewise all causes under one, the
first cause of all things: and as in a living creature there are many and
diverse members, whose functions are sundry and different: yet nevertheless
are all comprised under one only life and member, which is the heart, and are
by the same (as it were) gathered and held in a unity: so likewise if the
multitude be not so ordered and digested, that it may acknowledge one head and
superior, in whose heart shall rest principally engraued, an especial care to
conserve the common good, and the perfection of civil agreement (whereunto the
actions as well of every private citizen, as public magistrate, as to the last
chief and principal end ought to be directed) surely the same cannot long time
continue, but drawing diverse ways must needs fall to decay and ruin: for if
the charge of the common good be not principally to some one committed, of
necessity the too intentive care that every one will have of the particular
office wherein he is employed, must needs turn to the common hinderance: as
for example: The officers for provision of corn will cause out of all parts
great quantities to be brought to the city, procuring only the cheapenes and
plenty thereof, which perchance would not prove so profitable to the public
tolles. The officers likewise of the navy and sea matters (which are among us
of great estimation and credit) would industriate themselves peradventure too
much thereabout, in building great numbers of galleys, in gloriously adorning
the^ with all sorts of cost and warlike instruments, spending therein whatsoever
of the common treasure they could get into their fingers, through which over
costly diligence, the rest of the public receipts would hardly suffice to
repair castles, and walls of towers, to pay garrisons, and to defray other
public charges. By which means the commonwealth not cohering well together,
might easily sustain detriment, not by the faultines, but by the too much
carefulnes of the citizens, whilst every one endeavors to set forth and
discharge his office in the notablest manner he may: whereby it seems
exceeding necessary, that the care of the public weal should be committed to
some one, who being free from any private office, might only moderat and
direct the endeavors of the rest to the common good and vtility of all, which
authority to be committed equally to many, were very inconvenient: for as
Aristotle says, that which many have charge alike of, all do in a manner alike
neglect: neither if there be any thing amiss, can the blame thereof be imputed
more to one then to another: withal there never want most dangerous emulations
among those that are alike equal in authority. Now if one in this case should
be preferred and advanced above the rest, in dignity and rule with a
limitation of time, and not for tear me of his life, he then would imagine that
he had sufficiently discharged his duty, if it went well with the commonwealth
during his time of government, careless altogether what should become thereof
afterward: so that commonly many dangerous afterclappes ensue such reckonings,
which by certain and manifest experience may easily be proved by the example
of many commonwealthes, that in these times of ours have been ruinated through
such manner of government.

This Monarchall government was therefore established in this commonwealth of
ours with singular wisdom and judgment, and withal the same so curbed and
restrained with laws, that all dangerous inconveniences, whereby the
commonwealth might sustain harm, are thereby removed, and those commodities
jointly embrased that proceed from a kingly and royal government: so that there
seems nothing to remain which we could wish for, having a commonwealth
vnenthralled, enjoying a true liberty and freedom, and yet nevertheless as
it were a king for our governor. A prince therefore is chosen, who is entitled
with the dignity of a Duke, retayning the government of the commonwealth while
the time of his life endures, and chiefly and above all other things, having
care of the common good and general utility, by which as I proved before (and
that as I think with sufficient reasons) cities are preserved and maintained.

This Duke of ours has not any certain private office allotted him, yet
nevertheless there is not in the whole The dignity and authority of the Duke.
commonwealth any thing done, but he must be made acquainted therewith, and have
knowledge of the same. He is to contain and keep under in their duty, as
well every private man as every particular magistrate, and with such moderation
to direct them, that every thing may with an excellent harmony seem to tune to
the common good and civil union: lest any otherwise through too much diligence,
or too much negligence in his office, might chance to hinder the common
profit. This therefore is the office of the prince, that being (as it were)
placed in a glass, he might behold what every one does, especially those that
are in authority, of whom if he find any faulty in his office, if the matter
be light, he calls him before the whole college, and there sharply
rebukes him with words: if his offense be of greater quality, he causes the
same to be enquired of and examined before the aduocators and the presidents of
the ten, and to be punished according to the sentence of the council. The
Duke himself also if he will, may use the authority either of an Aduocator or
President, and make report to the council of any offense, and of any
amercement or punishment that is thereupon to be inflicted: (wherein what
manner and custom is wont to be observed, shall be hereafter expressed, when
we shall come to speak of criminal judgments.) For so great is the princes
authority, that he may in whatsoever court adioine himself to the Magistrate
therein, being president as his colleague or companion, and have equal power
with the other Presidents, that he might so by this means be able to look
into all things.

Yet nevertheless so is this authority of his by laws retracted, that alone
he may not do any thing, neither being joined to the other magistrates has
he any farther power then every other president in his office. The authority
of the magistrates being so small, that no one of them how great soever he be
can determine of any thing of weight or moment without the opinion of the
Council. But of this in his place we will speak more plainly.

Besides this the prince has in every council equal authority with any of
them for one suffrage or lotte. Likewise in the great counsel, and assembly of
all the citizens, while the sessions are held concerning magistrates, he has
no power to yield more favor to a competitor of his kindred or parentage,
then to any other: observing the same equal priuledge which the other citizens
do: whereby I think any man may easily understand, that the Duke of Venice is
deprived of all means, whereby he might abuse his authority, or become a
tyrant* which ancient and long continued custom from the first beginnings of
the city, eue^ to these times, has now taken such foundation and root, that
there is nothing whereof the city of Venice need stand less in fear, the^
that their prince should at any time be able to invade their liberty, or
trouble their common quiet. But now least every one should refuse this
dignity; requiring so great pains and continual solicitude of mind, unless
there should thereunto be adjoined some sweetness or reward: this limitation of
authority is on the other side recompensed with an exterior princely honor,
dignity, and royal appearing show: for the ornaments of his body are
kingly, using always purple garments or cloth of gold. On his head he wears
in stead of a diadem, a veil of linne^, upon the same a hood or miter of
purple, garnished about with a fringe of gold, the part whereof that covers
the middle or hinder part of the head rises up in form of a horn. His seat
is somewhat higher then the rest, and in estate kingly. All the citizens, as
well those that bear rule and office, as those that are private men speak
unto him bareheaded and standing, which in these times is a sign of exceeding
honor. The prince never rises up to any person. All the letters of the
commonwealth are sealed, and go forth under his name. What prince, ambassador,
Magistrate, Captain, or whosoever else that writes to the senate, directs
his letters to the prince. The proclamations of laws, orders, and decrees, all
are done under his name. All their money, as well gold as silver is coined and
stamped with his name and picture. Finally to shorten my speech, in every thing
you may see the show of a king, but his authority in nothing, which without
doubt whosoever is wise cannot but confess to have been ordained by the
Venetian commonwealth with exceeding prudence and wisdom: because otherwise
without this reward of honor, the office of the prince would have been
reputed as burthenous and unpleasing, but that the reward, which is honor
following, sweetneth the same, according to the opinion of great philosophers:
so that Aristotle says in his Ethikes seeing those that do rightly and holily
perform their office in government, have more respect to the profit of other
men, then their own: there cannot by any other means be returned unto them a
due and equivalent recompense, but only by making them to exceed all the rest
in honor and dignity. Moreover the dignity of this prince causes all the other
citizens exceedingly to fear his reprehension, and perform the offices in
which they are placed, with the greater fidelity and care. There are to the
prince adjoined six counselors of Six counselors chosen out of six
quarters of the city.
six tribes, into which the City is divided, every tribe choosing one. Their
office continues eight months, and they are continually at the princes
elbow: nothing is said unto the prince but they do hear it: no letters are
sent forth but such as shall seem good and alowable to four of those
counselors, who also do in the letters subscribe their names; yet not in
those letters which are sent forth, but in those which are first written by the
secretaries of the commo^wealth, which are reserved, and the coppies of them
sent forth. In which also it is to be noted, that those letters which are sent,
not by the decree of the council, but by the commandment of the Prince and
Counselors, as they never contain but matters of small importance, so are they
of small authority. For as we have often said, all authority and power is
only to be attributed to the council, no one magistrate having of himself
any ample authority. But of the counselors we will speak more hereafter: now
I will return to the prince or Duke.

The Prince therefore being honored with this kingly appearance and show,
because oftentimes it fell out that private wealth suffised not to maintain so
great dignity and pomp: there is allowed unto the Duke out of the common
treasure yearly, three thousand and five hundred crowns of gold: and to the
end least some one covetous of increasing his substance, should neglect the
honor and dignity of the commonwealth, and convert that money to his private
use, there are certain charges imposed upon him, which at his own cost he
must see defrayed, with an especial care of the service and dignity of the
commonwealth: which if through avarice or sparing of money he neglect, there is
so great a fine and amercement set upon the head of his heirs, that whiles by
increasing his private wealth, and dispensing with his honor and dignity, he
shall think to enrich them, he shall in a manner utterly undo them: besides
the leaving of an eternal blot and ignominy to his posterity. He maintayneth
of his own charge many servants, or as you would say of his guard, but yet
such as wear no weapons. He always uses costly garments: he dwells in a
palace wonderfully adorned with goodly chambers and tapistry, abounding with
vessels of silver and all other such furniture, as is beseeming the degree of a
prince. Four times a year he makes a solemn and sumptuous banquet, to Four
times a year the Duke banketteth the citizens.
above threescore citizens, the same being ordered and set forth with all the
magnificency that may be. Where. in our predecessors brought into our
commonwealth the ancient order of the inhabitants of Lacedemon and Crete
(whose commonwealthes were noble and glorious) but with a much better
moderation and order: for they because they thought the often meeting of the
citizens was a mean to combine them together in friendship, instituted certain
public feasts at the charge of the common treasure, to which the citizens
assembling had means one to be acquainted with the other, and withal by so
friendly a meeting to confirm a new friend ship. But seeing that they all went
confusedly together, those assemblies could not be without troubles and
tumultes, and besides when those that were to feast and banquet the rest, did
desire to do it with daintiness, and magnificence, there could not but ensue a
great wast of the common treasure. Therefore with a certain amendment and
moderation is that ancient manner brought in use among the Venetians, and the
whole care and ordering thereof committed to the prince. Four times a year
therefore are the citizens banqueted of the prince, with fare truly honorable
and dainty, and yet for the exceedingnesse thereof not to be envied: neither
does every one come unorderly as it pleases him, but those whom the prince
shall vouchsafe to call: unless it be the Counselors, the Aduocators, the
Presidents of the xl. men, and the Presidents of the tennes, who in
pre-eminence of their offices, are usually present at the princes bankets: the
other citizens come not but invited.

These four feastings are in this sort divided, that the elder and worthiest
citizens being invited, do in the winter time upon S. Stephens day assemble
themselves in the public palace appointed for the princes habitation, and
with a solemn pomp wait upon the prince from thence to the church of S.
Mark, and there be present with him at Mass, which being ended, then they
wait upon him back to his house again, and there be pertakers of his
banquet. Likewise in the month of April on the day of Saint Mark (whose
memory is with exceeding honor solemnized of the Venetians, as entituling him
their patron and defender, ever since the relics of his body were brought
unto Venice, from forth of Alexandria a noble City of Egypt) the citizens of
less age and dignity invited of the prince, do in like manner (after the
solemnities in the church are ended) convey him home and dine with him.

Thirdly, upon Ascension day, being the day of the great fayer at Venice, they
are invited and admitted to the Princes banquet, that are fully arrived and
entered into that age which we call Virilis or man's estate. These also do early
in the morning wait upon the Duke from his house, and go aborde a ship
gorgeously trimmed and set forth, reserved only to that use, and is by the
Venetians called Bucentoro: so soon as they are passed the marshes and come
to behold the plain and open sea, by an ancient indulgence of the high Bishops
(who honored this commonwealth of ours, in regard of many notable exploites by
it achieved against the The Dake of Venice marieth the sea with a ring of gold.
enemies of the Christian faith) the prince throwing a ring of gold into the
sea, uses in a manner these speeches, that with that ring he does betroth
himself to the sea, in token of a true and perpetual Empire. To this there
are added certain ceremonies by the Patriarch of the City, which being
ended, they land at the Church dedicated to Saint Nicholaus, a thing of great
antiquity, built upon that shore or bank which divides the sea from the
lakes. There the holy mysteries are celebrated, which being ended, they go
aborde the ship again, and return to Venice, attending on the Prince home to
his house, where they dyne with him.

The fourth and last banquette pertayneth to the young citizens, who the
twelve Kalendes of July, on the day dedicated to the two Martyrs Vitus and
Modestus, do with solemn pomp wait upon the Prince to the Temple of those
Martirs, which is situate near to the great channel that divides the city
in the midst: which channel is for that time conjoined with a bridge made
upon two galleyes, least otherwise to make that journey, would cost a very long
and laboursome circuit and compass. The church being visited, and the
solemnities in the church finished, they attend upon the prince home to his
palace, where they are received with a royal and magnificent banquet. There
are to these bankets admitted dauncers, iesters, and excellent singers, to
recreate and delight the guestes, and withal certain sports and plays are
intermingled, which do move exceeding mirth and pleasure: and this ancient
custom is still observed in the commonwealth of Venice, though somewhat
moderated. For by this means the citizens in a manner of every degree, yea
equals with equalles are entertained at the princes table: which seems
exceedingly well ordered and disposed, as well for the dignity of the prince,
as also for nourishing and maintayning love and good will among the citizens.
But because every citizen that is a gentleman, cannot every year receive this
grace of being invited, it is by an old law ordained, least any one should
seem to be left out, that the prince should in the winter time send to every
citizen that has privilege of A strange ceremony observed by the Duke of
Venice, but now the same is altered, and the wild ducks changed into a piece of
silver coin.
voice in the greater Council five wild duckes, as a portion or share of the
public banquet, which likewise is a great mean to the Duke of winning the love
and goodwill of the citizens.

In these chargeable expenses does the Duke yearly consume and spend a great
part of that money which he receives out of the common treasure: so that
though the Duke would be covetous, yet cannot he in a manner stain with any
baseness the nobleness and dignity of the place he holds.

Here because the whole power and authority of the prince is in a manner
already expressed of us, it shall not be amiss to declare in what season and
time the beginning was of creating a Duke in Venice, and finally what is the
order of the sessions in his election.

The beginning of creating a Duke in Venice.
Immediately from the first beginning of the City, when the noblest citizens
of the Venetian province, (their greatest cities, as Aquileia, Altina,
Concordia, Vderzo, Padoua, and many other of great opulencie and richesse,
being ruinated by the Hunnes, under the conduct of Attyla their Captain, who
filled Italy with fire and blood) did assemble themselves in those flattes of
the Adriatique sea, where Venice since was builded, and every one of them had
chosen for his mansion those places which were nearest to the country which he
had abandoned: it came to pass that there were by them built about two and
twenty towns, partly upon that shore or bank which encloseth the inner lakes,
partly upon certain hillockes which appeared out above the lakes. But in the
beginning when those towns were neither of themselves sufficiently fortified
and fenced, neither every of them so furnished with shipping, that it was able
to resist the incursions of thieves and pirates, they thought it meet (seeing
their fortunes were all alike) to govern their matters by a common council,
as well for the provision of corn, wine, fruits, and other necessaries, as
also the security of their persons and families, thereby to avoid the danger
of pirates and rouers, to which in regard of their weak, scattered and
unfortified towns, they lay in a manner open. Therefore when firsteuery town
had chosen from out his other citizens a chief and sufficient man, calling him
by Every town did choose a Tribune.
the name or title of Tribune, they generally altogether ordained, that upon
certain appointed days these Tribunes should meet, and consult together the
common business: but finding in the end an inconvenience in the variety of so
many opinions and authorities, and suffering withal many incommodities, they
thought nothing would do better then to lay the whole charge of the general
and common affairs upon some one particular man, whom all the rest should
acknowledge as their prince and ruler. It was therefore by general consent of
the xxij. towns concluded and agreed, that The princes seat assigned him in
the town of Heraclea.
there should one Duke or Prince be chosen, and his seat assigned him at the
beginning, in the town of Heraclea, situated on the inner side of the lakes,
in a certain Island near to the mouth of the river Piaue, which in our time
(by inundation of the floods) is now joined to the firm lands, But afterward
this place seeming unfit, because it was far off, so that many times before
the prince could have advertisement, the Pirates had already entered the lakes,
oppressed at unawares the inhabitants, and spoiled their shipping. Therefore
they thought The princes seat transposed to Malamoco.
it better that the prince leaving Heraclea should plant his seat in Malamoco,
a town seated upon the midst of the bank: whence the Duke might easily and
soon have inckling of any whatsoever attempt of the Pirates, and Pipin invaded
Italy.
with small adoo be at hand wheresoever his presence The princes seat lastly
reduced to Venice.
should be requisite. But at length when Pipin (even in those very beginnings of
the Venetian city) threatened servitude and slaughter, and they abandoning (in
a manner) the rest of the towns, they came altogether to Rialta, thither also
was the seat of the prince translated, by which means Venice in time
increased, and grew into that greatness in which we now do see it: so that by
a perpetual continuing custom, even from the beginning, there always was a
prince and governor of the Venetian commonwealth. At first for a while their
authority was greater: but afterward being by use of time and experience
taught, they began with wholesome statutes and laws to abridge his power,
bringing it by degrees into this temperature, in which we now do see it.

The manner of choosing the Duke of Venice.
The manner of choosing a successor to the deceased Duke, was at the first
altogether simple, and without ceremony: for our ancestors being men of great
soundness and integrity, and free from all ambition, did every one in his
particular, draw back from accepting a matter of so great a charge: so that by
a general cry and acclamation of the people, he was proclaimed prince that
was reputed to be the honestest and wisest man: But after those times, the
City and people increasing to a greater mightiness and state, it seemed a
thing not convenient to the greatness of so noble a commonwealth, to commit to
the rash and wavering voice of the multitude, a matter of so great weight,
honor, and dignity. It was therefore decreed, that there should be chosen out
11. of the most sufficient citizens, and that this authority of creating the
prince should be wholly unto the^ committed: but afterward as with their empire
their ambition increased, there were appointed certain several parliaments or
sessions, and a kind of intricate way found out in this election of the Duke,
which (least there should be any thing wanting in my undertaken task) I will
briefly express.

The Duke being dead, and his obsequies devoutly and honorably solemnized:
the Counselors, who presently upon the princes death during the interregne or
vacancy, betaking themselves to the public palace, appointed for the princes
habitation, do call and assemble The Dukes actions examined after his death.
together the great council. In that first assembly after the Dukes decease,
there are (according to the manner of the sessions before expressed) 5. citizens
created, whose office is diligently to look into and to examine the actions of
the deceased prince, and if they found any thing done by him against the laws
and statutes, then by opinion and authority of the council to cancel and
disanull the same. If he have received a bribe of any man, or have been sparing
in that due and ordinary expense which belongs to his dignity, then upon the
report of these five commisioners, there is such a fine and amercement imposed
upon his heirs, as the laws command: the penalty is only money, which is
levied upon the Princes inheritance, and carried into the treasure house.

In the same session are likewise chosen five other citizens, who immediately
upon their election do retire themselves into an aparted room, or conclaue
adjoined to the session house, out of which they do not depart, till after
many matters well debated, they do at length determine whether there is any
thing that in their opinion ought to be taken away, or added to the princes
authority. The matter being well discussed among them, the council is called
together again, which being done, they then come forth of the conclaue (for
before they may not) and every of them declares his opinion to the Council
concerning the authority of the prince, and then it being of the whole assembly
together advised on: it is by suffrages decreed which shall be most for good of
the commonwealth. And that decree is presently registered among the laws, which
the following Prince is bound to observe. The authority and power of the prince
being once settled and determined: the next day after is spent in that intricate
kind of sessions, in which the Prince is accustomed to be chosen.

No citizen allowed in those sessions which concern the election of their
prince, under the age of 30* years.
All the citizens that are above thirty year old do assemble and meet
together: for no one under that age is by an ancient institution of the
commonwealth admitted into that Council or sessions: then the citizens are all
of them numbered, and so many as they are in number, so many little balls are
thrown into a pot, of which thirty are gold, and the rest silver: The pot
is placed just before the tribunal of the sessions, where the Counselors do
stand: and by the same stands a little boy which pulls out the lottes. The
citizens are called and do come unto the pot every one according unto the
rank and order in which he sits, but no one is suffered, (as in their other
sessions the custom is) to put his hand into the pot, only the boy which
stands by, draws out for each of them his ball. Those that chance upon a
silver ball, do presently depart forth of the sessions: but he whom fortune
shall favor with one of those that are of gold, is presently in a high voice
published and pronounced by the secretary: and immediately goes his ways
apart into the inner room, and all his kindred and near allies do presently
arise out of their places, and all go together into one part or corner of the
hall. There they are numbered, and so many as they are, so many silver balls
are 30. chosen out of the whole multitude.
drawn out of the pot and given them, upon which without delay, they depart
out of the hall: so that only thirty, to whose lot the golden balls do
befall, are chosen and elected out of the whole assembly of citizens: and that
being done, the council is dismissed. These 30. reduced to 9.
After they are all departed, those thirty come again out of the conclaue, and
try once more their chance by lottery before the Counselors, so that of their
number only nine, whom this new lottery shall favor, are made Electors: and
the rest being dismissed, they go again into a closet appointed for the
purpose, and there are locked in alone, no one, no not a servant suffered to The
9. choose 40.
speak with them: nor they may not thence depart till they have chosen forty
men, of which forty no one can of them be declared as elected and chosen,
unless he have first six balls or suffrages in his favor: so that if there
be four of the nine contrary to him, he may not be elected. So soon as they
are once agreede in the choice of these forty men, they send word thereof
unto the Counselors by the public guardian or Porter: presently the
Counselors (unless the day be very far spent) do call and assemble the
great council: which being altogether in the Court, there is a list brought
out of the closet, wherein the names are written of the Electors: and then the
chief Secretary ascending the Tribunal, does with a high voice pronounce the
names of the forty elected citizens: of which every one as he hears
himself named, does arise from his seat, and going to the Tribunal of the
Counselors, does there sit down, and then goes thence into an appointed
closet or inner room: but if any one chance to be away, he is presently
enquired for by the Counselors, and the Presidentes of the forty, and sought
for with great diligence throughout the city. So soon as he is found out,
he is immediately by those Magistrates brought into the sessions, and thence
into the Conclaue to his fellows, without suffering him to speak or talk with
any man by the way: thereby to exclude all ambition and subornation out of the
sessions, which the will of our ancestors was, should be handled with all
uprightness and sincerity. By this means the forty designed citizens do
come together unawares, and being come together, the Council is presently
dismissed. Then these forty do come forth again out of the closet into a
large and open hall before the counselors, and there by the same manner of
lotterie as is The 40. reduced to 12.
before expressed, twelve of the forty are chosen, and the other eight and
twenty which remain, are put back and forsaken. These twelve again do
choose The twelve choose 25.
five and twenty others, of which every one must have eight suffrages, for
under none may be chosen: which being ended and done, they presently send
word thereof by a messenger to the Counselors. They, if the season of the day
serve, do call and assemble the Council, and (in a manner) as before those
five and twenty also unawares are assembled and gathered together, The 25.
reduced to nine.
and then the Council being dismissed, nine of them are by the same sort of
lottery as before, elected, the rest do go their ways. These nine elect forty
five other citizens, but no one of them, unless he have 6. of The nine do
elect 45.
the nine suffrages, which in the council in like manner again assembled are
pronounced of the Secretary, The 45. reduced to 11.
and so put into the closet. These by the like manner of The 11. do elect 41.
who have authority to choose the Duke.
lottery are reduced unto eleven, who do choose one and forty of the chief and
noblest Senators, who so soon as they are pronounced, do presently withdraw
themselves into a several appointed room: and these have authority to elect
the Duke: but so that there may not be by any means two of a kindred in the
number of electors, which is among the Venetians a perpetual custom in all
their offices.

Our ancestors (being men most wise and virtuous) The cause of this intricate
proceeding in the Dukes election.
made choice of this strange and intricate proceeding, to the end the whole
multitude might seem to have a part in this creation and election of their
prince. For the electors of the first order are made by lotte, of which all the
citizens are capable: next which they mingled election, but in sort that
election should exceed the lotterie: because no man may receive any favor by
the benefit of lottes, unless the same be allowed and approved of the first
order: but in the next order they would not that chance or lot should have any
force at all: because they thought it unfit and full of inconveniences, to
commit the choice of those that were to be electors of their prince, to the
temerity and arbiterment of fortune: in sort that neither is the multitude
wholly deprived of this authority, neither yet is the same committed to the
wavering wit of the inconsiderate people, among whom commonly a vain opinion
and ungrounded favor may do more, then a settled judgment of those that are
wise and virtuous. Besides, the not knowing who they are that are to be
electors of the prince, but the determination of the whole depending upon those
that are fortunate in their lottes: all aspiring pretensions and ambitions, are
thereby clearly cut off and taken away: because it may easily come to pass,
that those with whom there is any practice entertained, shall not have any
authority at all. But to return to the matter: the manner of the sessions
being in this sort accomplished, the one and forty electors of the prince,
immediately upon their election, without saluting or speaking to any man do go
into that Court, in which the senate is accustomed to assemble, where hearing
divine service, which is celebrated with great solemnity and devotion, laying
their hands upon the altar, they do promise with oath to God, and to the
commonwealth, that they will choose him for their Duke, whom they shall esteem
to be worthiest and of best desert, as well in love toward his country, as
in piety, carfulness and prudence, and then the priests departing, they
only are enclosed and locked within the Court alone, without so much as a
servant suffered to be among them. Then three of the eldest do sit down by at a
certain table fitted for that purpose, upon the which there stands a pot, and
every elector writes in a little scrol the name of him whom he thinks fit
to be created Duke, which scrolles being first all well meddled together, are
put into the pot, of which one is taken out, such as shall by chance come
into the hand of him that takes it forth. The scroll being read, he whose
name is therein contained, if he be present (as for the most part it
happens) goes presently out of the Court. Then if any shall think him to be
a man unfit, or incapable, or unworthy of so great a dignity, or for any other
cause shall not think his creation to be for the good of the commonwealth, he
rises up, and with an honest modesty speaks his opinion, declaring the
cause why he thinks it unmeet that he should be chosen and created Duke: when
he has ended his speech, the party is called in again, and the eldest in the
company declares the objections made against him, always provided that he
never names the author thereof: for they are all first bound by solemn oath
to observe perpetual silence. He on the other side excuses and confuteth (in
the best sort he may) the matters alleged against him. After which he
auoydeth the court again, and then if the first or any other will charge him a
fresh with any other matter, it is in their liberty to do it: and he again
being called in, has liberty to answer in his justification, and so till
the matter is by turn handled, till his accusers be silent, and have nothing
any farther to urge against him.

Then at last go they to their lottes: Somewhat before our time if the first
had had 25. suffrages in his favor, then was there no farther reckoning made
Andrea Gritti Duke of Venice.
of the rest, but he was straight proclaimed for Duke: but in our time in those
sessions in which Andrea Gritti (a most honorable Senator) was proclaimed
Duke, this custom was altered. For although none be elected Prince unless he
have five and twenty suffrages: yet the matter consists not as before it
did, in him that first obtayneth that number, but proceeds still forward to
the rest, so that if any go beyond that number; he then is proclaimed Duke,
and not the former. After the lottery is ended concerning him whose name was
first drawn, then is there an other scroll taken forth of the pot, and all
things concerning the same ordered in every point as the former: and so the
third, fourth, and finally all: but if no one of the whole number have in his
favor the complete sum of those suffrages, then if the day be not too far
spent, the sessions are once again begun in the same manner as before: and to
the end that the expedition should be the greater, it is not lawful for any of
the electors to depart thence, neither have they liberty to speak with any
stranger, till five and twenty of them are agreed in the election of the Duke:
whom so soon as they have named and chosen, the Counselors are presently
called into the court, who first do with all reverence and honor salute the
new prince. The fame of which presently flies through the city: in every
part whereof you may behold the citizens making joy, and throwing up The
solemnities that follow the election of the prince.
their prayers to heaven for this prince, that his government may be fortunate
and happy to the commonwealth. All his parents and kinsefolkes come presently
unto the Court, congratulating with him, of this his great honor and dignity:
in mean while the coyners are set a work to stamp money, with the face and
name of the prince, and all things busily prepared that the future pomp
requires: in which season the Duke and the Counselors do apparel
themselves, and being apparelled and in order, do so discende out of the
Court, and go directly unto the Church of Saint Mark, being near thereunto
adjoining, a church of wonderful goodlinesse and magnificence, and
resplendishing in all sorts and variety of rich ornaments and pompous
architecture. They do first religiously, and with great veneration, adore the
mighty name of God, and then do all ascend up into a high and stately seat,
made all of Porphire stone, whence the eldest of the electors makes a speech
unto the people, wherein he declares the creation of the new Duke, uttering
withal some few words in a modest commendation of him. After whom the Duke
also makes an oration, in which after having spoken discreetly a few things
concerning himself: he there promises and voweth to observe all such things
as shall become a virtuous prince, with greater care of the good of the
commonwealth, then of any his own private commodity: chiefly that he will
bear himself in matter of justice most holily and strictly, with endeavor
that equal right may be administered to all men, that he will not spare his
private substance, his labor, no nor his life: if by any incommodity of his
the estate of the commonwealth might be assisted or remedied. Finally, he
humbly prays unto God, unto S. Mark (under whose patronage the City of
Venice is) and to all the Saints, that they will be all favorable and
helpefull unto him in the well discharging of this great and honorable office.
His words are received of the people with a great applause: And at the end
thereof they do all descend from off the high seat or scaffold, and do place the
Duke before the high altar, where laying his hand upon the Gospel, he does
bind himself by solemn oath to God and to his commonwealth, that he will not
omit the performance of any such thing as the Duke of Venice is bound unto by
the laws. This being done, the Electors (that hitherto remained with the Duke
do all depart, he mounteth up into a pulpit of wood, taking with him one of
his kinsemen, such as ofall other he holds dearest: which pulpit the
mariners, such as are best esteemed, do take upon their shoulders, and with a
great shoute and joy do carry the Duke sitting therein throughout the whole
place of S. Mark, who from out the pulpit throws money coined in his own
name round about him. There is no certain sum herein limited, but even
according as the substance of the Duke may bear, the same being wholly
referred to his disposition and pleasure: but once, the people be not negligent
in gathering it up. At length having gone about the place, when they come
before the stairs of the princes palace, they there stay the pulpit, and the
prince descends out. The apparel which the Duke wears, and likewise a
silver pot, in which the money so thrown about among the people was kept,
belongs by an ancient custom unto the mariners, that did so bear the Duke
upon their shoulders. The Duke mounting up the degrees of the palace, is there
received of the Counselors, and there by them crowned with the foresaid Miter,
which is as it were the Dyadem or ornament of the Prince. This is the order of
the whole pomp. The day following the Senate is assembled in the Court, and
the Duke makes an oration, giving thanks to God, and to the fathers for this
advancement and honor which he had received, promising withal, that his
diligence and travail shall never be spared for the commonwealths commodity.
The like oration he makes before the whole assembly of citizens in the first
sessions that is held after his creation.

Having now sufficiently spoken of the Duke or prince of our commonwealth, it
remaining that briefly we speak somewhat concerning the Counselors, to the
end that you may understand what their authority is, and how far it extends.

There are always (as I said before) six Counselors The office and authority
of the 6. Counselors.
present by the princes side, out of every quarter of the city one: for the
whole city is divided into six quarters or tribes: three of the which are on
this side of the great channel, which divides the city, and three on the
other: out of each of these quarters is chosen one counselor in the sessions,
according to the manner before expressed in the choice of other magistrates.
Their office continues only eight months, in which jointly with the Prince
they take care of all such affairs as pertain to the commonwealth. But the
whole manner and handling of the sessions, an ancient ordinance passes chiefly
through their hands. Likewise if report is to be made unto the great council
of any matter, and by authority thereof to be confirmed, they are to make report
thereof, as those to whose authority that right only belongs, yet sometimes
the Presidents of the 40. are adjoined to the^, who otherwise were insufficient
and without power to make report over to the council. No other magistrate (the
Duke only always excepted) has this authority. They may likewise (if it
please the^) make report of any thing to the Senate or the ten men: but the
charge of assembling the Senate, and reporting to the same chiefly belongs to
the Preconsultors, like as the office of the Presidentes of the ten is to
assemble the ten, and to make report unto them: the manner of which shall
hereafter be more largely handled. But the Counselors are endued with greater
privilege, as those that have in the senate equal authority with the
Preconsultors, and in the courts of the ten men, with the presidentes of
that Court: for the space of eight months they are always present with the
Duke: and do exercise these offices of which I have made mention. But four
months they are present or rather Presidentes of the forty men, who have the
handling of weighty and capital matters, which are by their judgment decided
and determined of, as shall hereafter more plainly be declared. Now seeing that
which concerns the great council, which represents in this commonwealth
popular estate, and that likewise of the prince, which bears the person of a
king, is handled of us, though vneloquently, yet faithfully, and with
diligence, the undertaken work seems to require at my hands, that I should
likewise speak of the other parts and branches of this government, which in
seeming do represent the rule and government of the nobles and best citizens,
seeing that especially the same does in the city of Venice excel the rest: as
in the following volume I will by Gods help, make manifest and plain.

The end of the second book.
The third Book of the Magistrates and Commonwealth of the Venetians.
EVery institution and government of man, the nearer it aspireth to the praise
of perfection and goodness, the nearer should it imitate nature, the best
mother of all things: for so has she disposed the order of the whole world,
that those things which are deuoide of sense and understanding, should be
ruled and governed by those that have sense and knowledge: and therefore in
this assembly of men, (which of us is called City) old men ought to be
preferred before the younger fort, as those that are less subject to the
perturbations of the mind, and withal having been of longer life, must
needs be of greater experience in the affairs of the world. Therefore
Aristotle in his Politiques most wisely says, that in every commonwealth which
would emulate and follow the wisdom and policy of nature, old men should be
placed at the helm, and the office of the young men should be to obey and to
execute those things, which the old men should command them. Neither can the
young men, seeing this institution is nearest unto Nature, by any means find
fault or repine at the government of old men, or stir up therefore any
sedition in the commonwealth: seeing that in this difference which age only
makes, envy has no place, neither may there justly be any complaint, so
long as the young men shall assuredly hope to receive the like obedience in
their age, of the following younger sort: which opinion of Aristotle is allowed
of all commonwealthes that ever were of any fame, who always preferred the
counsel of the elder sort, as The name of senate derived from Senes signifies
old men.
well in the government of their City, as in the administration of their other
public affairs, neither is the name of senate from else where derived, then
from old men, who in the Latin tongue are called Senes. I would allege here
the commonwealth of the Romans, of the Athenians, of the Carthaginians, of
the Lacedaemonians, besides the laws of sundry other cities, but that the
matter is of it self so manifest, that it stands not in need of any such
proof.

With this reason therefore was the Senate ordained and established in this
commonwealth of ours, and likewise the council of the ten, who in the city
of Venice in whose commonwealth (as I said) there is a mixture of the three
governments royal, popular, and noble, do represent the state of the
nobility, and are (as it were) the mean or middle, which reconcileth and
binds together the two extremes, that is, the popular estate represented in
the great council, and the prince bearing a show of royalty. So says Plato
are the extreme elements, the earth and the fire, joined and bound together
with the middle elements, as in a well tuned dyapason the extreme voices are
concorded together by the middle tunes of the Dyatessaron and Diapente.

The number of right and lawful senators are 120.
To go forward therefore with my purpose, the senate of Venice has a hundred
and twenty lawful senators, besides many other magistrates that do also
obtain the privilege and right of Senators, so that now in this time of ours
there are above two hundred and twenty that have the authority of using their
suffrages in the senate. The lawful Senators are every year created by that
assembly of citizens, which (as I have often repeated) is termed the great
Council: Neither has this honor any vacation, as the other magistrates have,
but they may if their lot fall out, and that the great council be therewith
pleased (which for the most part happens) continue every year in that
office. The manner and mean of their election is of us before declared, when
we expressed the form of the whole sessions. There are in the months of
August and September in every session six Senators elected: which session
being in those sessions ten times removed, make up the number of threescore
elected Senators, the other threescore are joined, or (as it were) ascribed to
the former, and they all are chosen together at certain particular sessions.
For upon the nine and twentieth day of September, the senate does assemble, and
then every senator and other that has authority of suffrages, names a citizen
in the Senate. And the next day early at three a clock in the morning, the
whole number of citizens comes into the session house, and then the names
being rehearsed by the Secretary of all those citizens, who the day before were
named of the Senators, the names of all are put into a pot, and afterward
taken out by chance. By and by they go to their lottes, of which threescore of
those that shall have most lottes in their favor (so that they exceed not the
half) are that year ascribed in the number of Senators, but yet in that sort
that there may not be in that last number above two of a kindred: so that in
the whole number of lawful Senators, there cannot in all be above three of a
kindred, which ordinance seems to have been established with exceeding
wisdom in behalf of the commonwealth: considering that there cannot happen
to a commonwealth a more dangerous or pestilent contagion, then the
ouerweighing of one part or faction above the other: for where the balance of
justice stands not even, it is impossible that there should be a friendly
society and firm agreement among the citizens: which always happens where
many offices of the commonwealth meet together in one. For as every mixture
dissolueth, if any one of the elements (of which the mixed body consists)
overcome the other: and as in music the tune is marred where one string
keeps a greater noise then he should do: so by the like reason, if you
will have your commonwealth perfect and enduring, let not one part be
mightier then the other, but let them all (in as much as may be) have equal
share in the public authority. With excellent wisdom and providence
therefore did our ancestors cause this to be established as a perpetual law
and decree in our commonwealth, that not only in the senate, but also in all
other offices there should not be any more of one kindred or alliance, then
the preservation of equality required. Neither seems the order of electing
the Senate invented with less forecast and prudence, which is that threescore
citizens should be chosen, according to the accustomed use of the sessions,
chance, election and judgment, being therein mingled altogether, but that the
choice of the other threescore should be after another sort, such as you have
heard, wherein chance has no force at all: for if in them all chance should
have borne sway, it might easily have happened, that the principal citizens
might have been left out, to the great prejudice of the commonwealth. They
ordained therefore that there should yearly be chosen threescore fathers, not
by casualty of The last 60. senators which are elected are called adiunctes.
lottes, but by soundness of judgment. So you see that the Senate first
consists of a hundred and twenty, of which threescore are by their proper
term, called Senators, the rest, Adjuncts: in the session of whose choice,
there is commonly a whole day passed over. Now besides this hundred and twenty
lawful Senators, those of the council of ten have in the Senate equal
authority with the Senators, as also beside the Duke and the other
counselors, the council of the forty have the like, the judges of capital
and weighty crimes, the masters over the salt and corn, and the procurers of
S. Mark, besides many others: so that in our time their number exceeds two
hundred and twenty, who in their offices have all the power and authority of
Senators. The whole manner of the commonwealths government belongs to the
senate. That which the senate determines is held for ratified and inviolable.
By The great authority and power of the senate.
their authority and advise is peace confirmed and war denounced. The whole
rents and receipts of the comcomwealth are at their appointment collected and
gathered in, and likewise laid out again and defrayed. If there be any new
taxations or subsidies to be laid upon the citizens, they are imposed, and
likewise levied by the Senates decree. And if at any time it shall seem
necessary for the good of the commonwealth, to create a new officer or
magistrate upon any sudden urgent occasion, he is by the senate elected.
Besides, the senate by a perpetual prerogative, has authority to choose such
Ambassadors as are to be sent to foreign princes, and likewise to create the
college of those, whose office is to assemble the senate, and to report unto
them. Those are of Aristotle termed Praeconsultores, but we Preconsultors or
Sages.
honoring them with a prouder title, do call them Sages, which name we must in
this discourse often use, least otherwise I should seem to mislike of our
common phrase of speaking. Nevertheless these sessions of the senate, in which
both the Ambassadors and the Sages are elected, stand nothing so much in the
arbiterment of chance, as those before described, that is to say, the great
councels, wherein the whole number of the citizens is assembled and gathered
together: for every one of the senators names one whom he thinks good, and
then go to their suffrages, of which whosoever shall have more then the rest,
provided always, that he have about the half of the whole number on his side,
is presently ratified and chosen, And if at any time the service and necessary
occasion of the commonwealth seem to require the employment of some one in an
office, which they think he would be unwilling to accept, then does every one
of the senators secretly in a little scrol note the name of him whom he
thinks fit for the charge, putting the same into a pot provided ready for the
purpose, after which the Secretary takes those scrolles out, and reads them
all openly: and then again they go for every one of those to their lottes, of
which on whomsoever the greatest part does fall, is presently pronounced chosen:
provided always that he have more then half of the whole number. This manner
of writing in scrolles was invented, least otherwise some might refrain from
naming him whom they thought fit for government and discharge of that office:
least in regard of his unwillingness to accept it, they might thereby incur
his displeasure and evil will, whereby through a private regard the common
good might receive prejudice.

The manner which the Senate uses in their consultations and decrees.
Now it remains that we declare the manner that the Senate uses in
determining, decreeing, and consulting upon those things which are to be
done: and in what sort the decrees of the Senate were wont to be executed.

Sixteen Sages elected.
Our elders were not ignorant, that if every Senator should confusedly make
report unto the Senate, and then deliver his opinion without limitation or
restriction of that office to some particulars: there must of necessity follow
a great trouble and intricatenesse in the Senate. Besides, it is by experience
approved, that the thing which depends generally alike upon the care of all,
is generally alike in a manner of all neglected.

Therefore it was by our laws ordained, that there should be chosen sixteen
citizens out of the senate, which in respect of their farther knowledge and
sufficiency above the rest, are of the common sort called Sages, we imitating
Aristotle (in regard that they are to consult before hand among themselves and
then to council the senate in those things that are to be handled) may well
call them Preconsultors. These have authority to assemble the senate, and to
make relation of each matter unto them. This magistrate does not continue in
The Sages divided into three sorts or orders.
office any longer then six months. But now these Sages are divided into three
sorts, of great difference and diversity the one from the other: for in the
first are six senators of the most noble and citizens, excelling the rest as
well in dignity and estimation, as in prudent gravity and profoundnesse of
knowledge. Their office principally is, that in weighty and important causes
concerning the state of the commonwealth as well in matter of wars, as in
things of peace, they are first among themselves to hold a long and deliberate
consultation, and then to give over their council and opinion to the senate.
In the second sort or order are only five, who though they have equal
authority with the other, in making report of all things to the senate, yet
are they of far less estimation and dignity. To them chiefly belongs the
care of the soldiers that are by the commonwealth entertained in pay, and are
under the government of the General of the Venetian forces. Of the third order
there are also five to whom the charge of all sea matters is committed, of
which only and of nothing else they have authority to make report unto the
senate. This office was held of our ancestors in great reputation, during the
while that our commonwealth did flourish and was famous in matters of
navigations: but when once our minds were bent to the enlarging of our limits,
and to the greatness of rule by land: then began our seafaring matters to
decline, and with them the reputation of this office, so that in this age of
ours, young men and some in a manner beardlesse are admitted thereunto. These
sixteen citizens therefore, whose assembly among the Venetians by proper term
called, the College, do early in the morning meet together with the prince
and the counselors, and first they spend the day till it be three a clock, in
giving audience to private suitors, that have any cause either with the
commonwealth or with any particular magistrate, whose suits and causes they do
there altogether determine and end, unless the matter be of such importance,
that it behooves them to make report thereof unto the senate.

After three a clock all private men are dismissed out of the court, and
presently all such letters as are sent unto the senate are read by one of the
secretaries that belongs to the state: after which the Sages or Preconsultors
do withdraw themselves apart into a Conclaue or council chamber, there to
consult of public business, unless they be detayned by the Ambassadors of some
Prince, that desires audience of the Duke and the College, or by some other
business of great and weighty moment.

After that they are withdrawn and placed every one in his seat: he which
there presideth (which prerogative each of them inioyeth seven days together,
one after the other as his turn comes about) propounds that cause or matter,
which they are in council to debate of. Then he demands of every one his
opinion, yet observing such order, that those of the first sort, as they are
noblest in degree, so they be first entreated to speak their advise, and
after them the other five, whom we placed in the second rank or order. Lastly
if the question concern any sea matters, the five of the last order, who have
charge thereof are asked their opinion. But if the matter propounded do not
pertain to sea business, they are to hold their peace. In each rank or
order he always first speaks his advise, that had the Presidencie the last
seven days, and then next unto him the eldest of the company, and after him
the rest accordingly unto their age. Lastly of all, he which did propound the
matter, and sits during those seven days as President and chief, utters
his conceit. The matter being at length well disputed of among them: whether
they be all of one opinion or divided into sundry (as the dispositions of men
are different and diverse) they go first to the prince and council, before they
assemble the senate: and there do repeat the several opinions of all, to
which if the prince or any of the counselors do seem to lean or give his
assent, or shall otherwise of himself yield any other different reason, the
matter is then once again debated of among them, and finally every man's
opinion put in writing, which belongs to those to do that are secretaries of
this three several orders. The business then being well debated of, that is
to be determined by authority of the Senate, the Senate is assembled.

When the senators are come into the Court, first all such letters as are of
moment, and were delivered to the Duke and Sages since the dismissing of the
last Senate, are there recited. Then are the opinions of the Sages repeated
concerning those matters that were in their College debated, whether they were
all of one mind or of sundry, even in a manner in the same sort, as the
requests of the people, of which Plato speaks, were wont to be among the
Athenians. But none other besides those, who (as I told you) are of the
Venetians called Sages, has power or authority to make report unto the senate,
and then to confirm and establish his opinion by authority of that order:
always I accept the Duke, the counselors and the Presidents of the forty, of
whom I will at large declare, and speak more hereafter.

The opinions of all being read and perused in the senate, he that is for that
week president of the first order of Sages, arises if he so think good: if
not the eldest or else any of the other, to whom being desirous to speak, the
rest are contented to give place, and from a seat or scaffold made of purpose
somewhat higher then the rest, he makes his oration to the senate: alleging
such reasons as he thinks meetest to confirm his opinion, and to refute
that which is maintained to the contrary, yet modestly, and with gravity, as it
beseems a senate of so honorable a degree and order. After that he has
ended, another of the Sages that differs from his opinion, arises,
fortifying his own advise with the best reasons he can yield, and refelling
the former, and likewise the rest, if there be any more that do disagree from
his. Then the third, (if there be so many diversities of censures among them)
stands up, by proofs and arguments endeavoring to maintain and confirm
that which he thinks meet and convenient: and so by course still is the
matter pleaded and argued among them, till there remain not any one more that
will speak: as for the Senators no one of them may speak, till the Sages that
will take the matter upon them, have made an end: but when they have with
reasons, arguments and proofs contended and thoroughly debated the matter of
each side as much as shall seem good unto them, then have the other Senators
also liberty to speak: of which if any will gainesay or confirm any of the
former opinions, or allege any new of his own, he may freely do it at his
pleasure: though as for the opinion of which himself shall be author and
inuentor, he may not himself make report thereof unto the Senate: but if it
shall be thought good and profitable for the commonwealth, then commonly one of
the College, or a counselor, or the President of the forty relates the same
unto the Senate. By which means the matter being at length well and thoroughly
sifted and discussed: then does the senate determine by the suffrages of those
that are of that order, whether of the opinions is to be allowed: yet do they
not with words or signs confirm or refute that opinion, as we read the
ancient Romans did, neither do they speak it publicly for every one to
hear: but their manner is to decide it with pots and suffrages, not much
unlike the order I told you was observed in the Sessions.

The secretaries of the senate bring forth as many pottes as there are opinions
concerning the matter debated of, and one besides which is green, into which
are put the lottes of all those that do dislike that advice and counsel: and
another read, which receives the balls of those Senators, that remain
doubtful to whether opinion they should incline. The other Senators every one
puts his ball into his pot whose opinion he likes and esteems above the
rest: if he like none at all then he puts it into the green pot, and if
he be doubtful, into the red. The Counselors do tell the balls, and that
opinion is held for ratification and decreed, which shall have in favor
thereof the balls of half the senators, which number if none of them attain
unto: then first, that opinion which is favored with fewest balls, is quite
rejected, and for the rest they go to their lots again: and so in that manner
still rejecting that which has fewest bals, the controversy is at length
brought only between two, of which the one must of necessity have above half
the suffrages, and then the same is by the decree of the senate authorized and
allowed. One matter being dispatched, they begin with another (unless it be
too late in the day) always observing the same manner as is aforesaid.

The manner of giving audience and dispatching Ambassadors.
If there come an Ambassador from any prince to the commonwealth of Venice, he
is received of the Duke, the counselors and the whole college, and does
before them express his embassage: which being heard, they do for that time
dismiss him, demanding space to consult upon the matter, which having done in
sort and form as you have heard, they then demand the opinion of the Senate.
To which the Duke first declares the effect of the Ambassadors demand, and
then the opinions are read of all those that have authority to make report to
the senate, and finally in manner as before. The senate determines what
answer shall be made unto the Ambassadors demand: who being called in, a
Secretary reads unto him the decree of the Senate, upon which he is
dismissed. This is in effect the whole sum, manner, and form that the Senate
uses in The council or college of the ten.
their consultations, decrees and councels: and therefore now I think it
requisite in this place to say somewhat of the council of the ten, of which
you have often heard me make mention. This council or College of the ten is
among the Venetians of great and eminent authority, and of which any man may
boldly say, that the whole safety of the commonwealth depends. I will
therefore touch the beginning and original thereof, to the end that the whole
manner and course of the same may be the easilyer conceived. Our elders did
with a marvelous and in manner divine providence foresee, that as in man's
body, through the corruption and putrefaction of one humor, many and most
dangerous diseases do commonly happen, which grow in time to be the causes
of death: so also in a commonwealth there are sometime wicked and disloiall
citizens, that are causes thereunto of great troubles and calamities, whiles
they aspire rather to the pride of a wicked and unjust commandment, then to
the praise of an honest and quiet obedience: carried away in those damnable
endeavors either with ambition, and desire of rule, or oppressed with
intolerable debt, or otherwise having committed some heinous wickedness or
crime, for which they stand in doubt of punishment: such as we read was in
Rome, Cateline, Silla, Marius, and finally Julius Caesar, who having by tyranny
gotten the commonwealth, did (in a manner) bring it to utter desolation and
ruin. The like we read of sundry commonwealthes Sundry great and famous
commonwealths overthrown by the infidelity and ambition of some their private
citizens.
of the Greeks, yea and those sometimes famous and of great glory, which by the
undermining ambition and treachery of some their wicked and unfaithful
citizens, were brought into servitude and bondage. But in these times of ours
Italy it self has yielded us sufficient examples, all the cities whereof (in
a manner) that were either governed by the people, or by the nobility, being
brought under the yoke or tirany of someone of their citizens. For which cause
our prudent elders labored to establish this commonwealth of ours in all
perfection and beauty, and to strengthen the same with such and so wholesome
laws, that it might as much as in man's wisdom lies, prevent the
inconvenience of so monstrous and miserable a fall: for they Nothing more to be
feared then intestine broiles and cauil dissentio^.
imagined that there was not any thing so much to be doubted and feared, as an
intestine enemy, or civil strife and sedition among the citizens. Calling
therefore to mind, that among the Lacedaemonians the Ephores were mighty and of
great authority, and among the Athenians the Areopagites, and so likewise among
the Romans the Decemuiri or ten men, insomuch The cause of the creation of
ten in the city of Venice.
that they made laws: they thought it not amiss by imitation of their example,
though in an unlike cause, to create in this our city some magistrate of
authority and power, whose office above all other things should be, to have
especial care to see that among the citizens should not arise any strife or
dissension, whereby there might ensue any scandal or uproar: and to prevent
factions, or the attemptes of any wicked citizen that should conspire against
the liberty of the commonwealth: of which sort of mischief if there should by
evil destiny, any creep into the commonwealth, they then to have absolute
authority to punish and chasten the same, least otherwise the commonwealth
might thereby receive harm.

But so great an authority and puissance could not have been committed to few
without danger, neither if to many, would it then have been formidable:
therefore to avoid the one and the other inconvenience, they ordained and
established this College of ten. They continue in this office a year, and
have adjoined unto them the Duke and the six Counselors, so that the whole
College comes to make up the just number of seventeen citizens, to whom
this great power and authority is given. Of these ten there are three every
month chosen and elected by lotte, who are Presidentes of the College, and The
heads of the Ten.
by common phrase of speech called the heads of the ten, and they have
authority to assemble the whole College of the ten, and to make report unto
them. They have aparte by themselves a chamber, wherein they assemble when they
sit in council. They have also under them private and particular officers,
as Porters, Vshers, and certain that are allowed for their guard. So that
there is not any other Tribunal of magistrates gone unto with greater
obseruaunce and ceremony. Thither resort allthose that have any thing to do in
their College. They likewise read all letters written to the College, and
make report of them to the same, for doing of the which with the greater
sufficiency, one of those Presidents alone by himself has not authority to
make report, but they must be either two to make report of the same matter,
or else four Counselors. For the same cause also and to avoid the rashness
and temeritie that some few of them might otherwise use in alteration of any
thing, it is ordained, that if they will cancel or undo any thing that is
already established and fully confirmed, they must at least have the Suffrages
of two parts of the College, for confirmation of that which they shall do,
which otherwise is held to be void and of no effect. They have also an order
that the offender is The offender never suffered to come into the College, not
any friend or Lawyer to plead for him.
never suffered to come into the college, when they are to give judgment of
him, nor any friend, kinseman, or Lawyer for him to plead his cause: which
privilege is granted to offenders in any other court whatsoever, where their
cause is handled. The manner used in their judgments is in this sort: The
offender is examined of the Presidents of the college, and his confession
written, and then the matter is reported to the College, the presidents of
which and the other Judges that are present do plead as well in the behalf of
the accuser as of the offender never determining of any great matter, but with
an exceeding moderation of judgment. In the beginning the charge only of
preventing and remedying all such things as any way should offend the civil
agreement of the commonwealth, was committed to the care of the ten. But
afterward certain other grievous and enormous offenses, as making of false
money, sodomie, and such like were also brought under the severity and censure
of this sharp and stricte manner of judgment. And in these times of ours this
authority of the ten has yet much more enlarged his bounds: for they have
power given them to set amercements upon sundry offenses, and to punish those
that shall blaspheme the name of God, or of the blessed Virgin: and it is
likewise or dayned, that whatsoever secret matters that should concern the
state of the commonwealth any way: that such (I say) should be brought and
disclosed unto them: who nevertheless do not determine any thing of great
moment without the opinion of the Senate. To the end therefore that a few
citizens should not alone have such successiue authority in so weighty
affairs, there are called and admitted into this college the Sages of the
first and second order: likewise the Fifteen senators ascribed to the college
of the ten, who are called Adiunctes.
Aduocators and procurers of S. Mark, whose office is held in great estimation
and reverence. There are besides fifteen Senators ascribed to this College,
who are called Adiunctes, but all these here rehearsed have not the privilege
of suffrage, but only the seuenteen first, and these fifteen Adiunctes: so
that the whole number of those that have authority of suffrage are two and
thirty. The rest are deprived of this power and privilege, though otherwise
they be present at all their business. The fifteen Adiunctes were not
accustomed to be elected neither of the Senate, neither of the sessions of the
great Council, but the ten men did of themselves make choice of fifteen
such Senators as they best liked for their assistantes and companions: though
now the same is altered, and the fifteen are chosen by the sessions of the
great Council, as the other magistrates are. That there has great utility
redounded to the commonwealth of Venice through this council and College of
ten: experience it self has made most manifest and plain. For two hundred
and ten years since Marino Phalerio that then was Duke, having turned all his
thoughts to tyranny and usurpation, was likely to have given a great and
deadly blow to the liberty Marino Phalerio Duke of Venice, publicly beheaded.
of our commonwealth, if by the grave authority and wisdom of the ten, he
had not been oppressed and put down, and received the reward of his impiety
and wickedness: for by their judgment and sentence, he had his head
publicly stricken off, and with him sundry other citizens of great nobility,
that together with him had conspired the ruin of their countries liberty, and
besides his memory was delivered to posterity with an eternal blot of
dishonor and infamy: For in those places where the pictures of our princes are
curiously set forth and painted, with Epitaphes and remembraunces of those
virtuous deeds, which they have done in the behalf and service of their
country, the seat of Marino Phalerio is left bare without any picture at all,
save only a few verses, signifying unto the reader, that this Duke was for his
offenses (because I will not vary the words as they stand written) stricken
with the axe: a conspiracy without doubt of passing wickedness, and exceeding
danger, in appearance not unlikely to have wrought the utter overthrow of the
commonwealth, if by the authority of the college of ten, the same had not
been presently extinguished. Likewise sundry other citizens, that being
tickled with this rumor of ambition, had published certain plausible laws, to
draw unto them the good wills of the people, were overtaken by the authority
of this college, and presently cut off: whereby it is come to pass, that
through the power of this College always assisted by the goodness of God, no
such pernicious infection has as yet been able to eat into our commonwealth.
Thus the principal parts of our commonwealthes are by us already expressed,
but now to the end that our undertaken work may be in every part perfect and
accomplished, we will speak somewhat of the remaining magistrates, as well
those, to whose hands is committed the administration of justice, as those
that have the handling and ordering of the public rents, and withal of the
manner of governing those cities that are under the Venetian commonwealth, as
also of their captains, nauies and armies, both by sea and by land. Lastly I
will make mention of certain statutes and ordinances, by which the danger of
the common peoples mislike, in that they also have not part in governing the
commonwealth is clearly avoided, with their great satisfaction and contentment:
I will likewise show, that the training and exercising the youths to the
exercises of war is not in the City neglected, as some suppose. But before I
proceed farther to these particular demonstrations, I think it not beside the
purpose to advertise the reader, that in this manner of the Senates
consultation, of which I have spoken, and likewise in that of the College of
Ten, there does plainly appear a certain mixture of the laws of a popular
state, with the government of a nobility. For whereas the senate cannot
deliberate of any thing if first report thereof be not made unto them of the
Sages, therein appears a state of nobility: but that the Sages have not any
power, unless they consult with the Senate, and have by authority thereof,
their opinions confirmed, tastes altogether of a popular government, so that
this just mixture and temperature, which makes the perfect measures and means
of government to be united in the true form and shape of a commonwealth, is
found not only in the whole body together, but also in every part and
particular member of this our commonwealth. But returning whence I digressed: I
will first of all handle that part which pertayneth and belongs unto Justice.

All right and justice therefore which is wont to be administered of magistrates,
is divided into two parts, for either it consists in the punishments of
lewd and wicked men, that shall in any notable sort trespass impiously
against God, and traitorously against their country, or wickedly against any
citizen, or member thereof in particular: or else it concerns the judgment
and determination of litigious controversies and civil causes. Criminal and
civil judges.
Therefore are there also in Venice two kinds of Judges, the one serving for
the decision of civil causes, the other for the judgment of capital crimes,
of whom we will first speak, and then of the other.

Some offenses are esteemed to be small and light, in regard of the proper
nature of the offense, or else of the condition of him that offended: others are
accounted to be more grievous and of greater importance, either through the
quality of the misdeede it self, or else through the nobility and degree of
him that does it: whence it comes that these capital judges are also divided
into two: the one for matters of great moment and grievous enormity: the other
for crimes less heinous and of smaller weight: which division of judgments as
it was first ordained with an exceeding reason and found foundation, so has
experience approved it for allowable and of high commendation: we will first
speak of the chiefest, and then of the rest.

Besides those offenses, which we told you were committed to the censure of the
ten: all other great and weighty crimes, being by the Aduocators reported
of, and by the College of forty well pondered and debated, are wont all to be
determined, and punnishment according to the quality of the crime to be
inflicted upon those that shall be found faulty therein. These forty that have
the examination and handling of weighty criminal causes, are commonly called
the xl. criminal Judges: we will speak of either, but we will first begin
with the Aduocators.

The office of the Aduocators.
The office of the Aduocators was in times passed in great authority and
marvelous estimation: the duty and function therereof being to defend the
laws pure and inuiolate, without suffering them in any one point The Aduocators
in Venice resemble the ancient Tribunes of the Roman people.
to be blemished, so that their authority and power is much like unto that of
the Tribunes of the Roman people, but that they were to defend the liberty of
the people, and ours only the force of the laws: so that in my judgment they
may, and not unfitly be termed the Tribunes of the laws. But we to avoid all
ambiguities, will still retain the common and accustomed word: they only
pleaded and made report unto the people, but ours to the xl. men for small
causes, for greater to the Senate, for greatest of all to the greater Council,
if so they shall think good: so that in ancient time the anthority of this
office was passing honorable. But now since the mightiness and increased
greatness of the Ten, this office is grown to be of less account, and the
estimation thereof much obscured. Nevertheless seeing there belongs to this
office so ample an authority of reporting in all causes, but especially the
guarding and defending of the laws: and seeing that those which have committed
any excess or crime, seem to have broken and transgressed the laws, it
seemed good that those offenses should in a certain peculiar sort be
corrected by the censure of the Aduocators, though of themselves they have not
any authority of determining any thing absolutely against the offenders,
unless it be in some small causes: the rest are all ordered by the sentence of
the Council.

In this place, I think it not from the purpose to explane The manner of
capital judgments.
the manner and mean of capital judgments, which are given upon the report
of the Aduocators, seeing that (unless I be deceived) the like custom is not
any where observed, withal I shall thereby the better and plainlier make you
understand what the authority is of this office of Aduocators.

When any crime or offense is brought before the Aduocators (if the same be
thought worthy of their censure) then presently is he, whose name is brought by
some one of them (the charge thereof belonging chiefly to three) declared and
argued to be guilty, and then report is thereof made over by him that argued
him, to what council himself shall best like, though usually such matters are
referred to the college of the xl which have presidence, and authority over
capital crimes and judgments. And there the matter being well debated of,
the council determines, whether the offender shall be put in prison or
tortured, or otherwise allowed to defend his cause at liberty, who is either
by the decree of the council presently sent for, or else secretly apprehended
by the Officers and Sergeantes that attend upon the Aduocators: and then he
is either at liberty, or as a prisoner examined upon the matter: he makes his
answer, and witnesses and proofs are produced on each side, and each
particular registered in writing, as well in the behalf of the offender, as
against him, and a coppie thereof given him, and a time of respite appointed
him to instruct his Aduocators, and such as he shall choose to plead for him:
and they likewise provide themselves of such proofs and arguments, as may
best serve for his defense, and for the disproofe and confutation of such
reasons and testimonies, as shall be urged against him, and then the matter
comes to the pleading.

I cannot here ouerslip an ancient custom observed of our forepassed elders
even unto this age of ours, which is, that if any do want means and ability
to entertayne an Advocate or Lawyer to plead and defend his cause: then are
there two Advocates appointed him at the charge of the commonwealth, to speak
and argue in the defense and maintenance of his right. For thereof the laws
have a special regard, Two advocates appointed by the commonwealth to defend
the cause of those that want means and ability to entertain them.
that no one do receive punishment without being first admitted to say what he
can in justification of himself. But after that due ceremonies are observed
with the offender, and all respects and liberties afforded him, that the
defense of his cause requires, the aduocators do warn the council, and a
day is appointed for the trial of his cause.

The Council being assembled, the accusation of the parties that stand upon
their trial, belongs to the Aduocators, who are in that behalf to behave
themselves with great sharpness, vehemence and severity, even in as inuectiue
a manner (if possible they could attain and reach thereunto) as that which
Cicero used against Verres or Antonius, yet so that they refrain from
unseemly railing, and do not digress or wander out of the matter with
extremity of spiteful words. For whosoever maliciously raileth, seems
rather to bewray a mind intemperate and hateful, then any way to advance the
commonwealthes cause. For in this point the matter is far otherwise among the
Venetians, then it was in times passed among the Romans. Aunciently in Rome
any citizen whatsoever might impleade another, and with all bitterness accuse
him before the Judges: but in Venice no private man may perform such office,
the same by the laws of the commonwealth belonging to the dignity and
magistracy of the Aduocators. In which point me thinks our ancestors did
rightlier imitate the nature of things, and had therein a more regardfull
foresight to maintain the citizens in agreement, then had the Romans. For
seeing that an offense committed is a breach of the laws, and a scandal to
the commenwealth, and the laws and the commommonwealth are to exact punishment
thereof: who can be fitter to require the punishment of him that offends, or
who ought thereunto to bend greater endeavor, then that Magistrate whose
authority, rule and dignity is wholly given him to defend the laws? Neither can
any private citizen play the part of an accuser, without exceeding envy and
hatred of him whom he shall prosecute, whence easily there might sedition and
trouble arise among the citizens, which inconvenience is by us notably avoided,
by laying this whole charge of accusations upon a Magistrate, who is not to
handle the same according to any private or particular dissentious conceit,
but according to the prescript rule and form of the laws: so that it has
never lightly been heard of, that ever any blame was imputed to an Aduocator
for using vehement inuectiues, or being a sharp accuser, but rather the
greater applause and praise thereby to arise unto him among all the citizens.
But let us now return to our before mentioned manner of judgments.

The Council being assembled, the Aduocator plaieth the part of a bitter
accuser, strayning the uttermost invention of his wits with all vehemence
against the offender, first obiecting unto him the offense, confirming the same
with witnesses, and then strengthening his objection with probabilities and
likelihoodes of conjecture: having ended his speech, the advocate of the
offender pleads in the Clyentes behalf: After which if any of the Aduocators
will speak afresh, before the Judges give sentence, he has liberty so to do:
likewise the Lawyers of the defendant have leave to answer and to confute, if
they can, the opposed arguments. And so of either side the cause is debated and
tossed to and fro, till either the offender or the Aduocator whose turn it is
to speak, does declare that he has no more to say, which done, the offender
and his advocates are commanded out of the Court, and the Aduocators are shut
into a room apart with the Judges and their Secretaries, not any one else
being suffered to be there. The Aduocators first do make a motion unto the
Judges of punishing the offender, demanding their opinions whether they think
him worthy of punishment or no, not naming or appointing any one certain kind
of punishment, which Two manner of judgments.
custom was (in a manner) observed by the Athenians: for in Athens the Judges
gave two sentences, in the first either condemning or absoluing the prisoner.
If in the first he were condemned, then was the manner of his punishment
determined of in the second, as out of Platoes Apology of Socrates may plainly
be perceived, the very like order of judgment is that in manner which we do
use: first (as I say) the aduocators make a motion unto the Judges of punishing
the offender. Then the Judges go unto their suffrages, for by suffrages among
the Venetians all things are determined. Three pots are brought forth, by the
one of which the offender is condemned: by the other he is absolved in manner
without any correction, and by the third are known the opinion of those, which
do seem yet to doubt whether course is to be taken: the first of condemnation
is white, the second of absolution green, the third of doubtfulnes read.
Every of the Judges, whether the cause be disputed of by the forty (as usually
it is) or else that the senate be consulted with (which seldom happens) and
that only in great and weighty causes, or whether it be by the aduocators
reported over to the great council, which is most seldom, and never but in
matters exceedingly enormous, to the end to have his suffrage undiscerned,
lets fall into whether of these The manner of the prisoners trial.
three pots he pleases a little linen ball: which being done, the presidents
of the council do number the balls, and if more then the half be in savor of
the prisoners liberty, he is presently pronounced free, and the request of the
aduocators rejected. But if more then the half of those bals, be found in the
pot of condemnation, he is presently condemned: if neither of both exceed the
half, but that the greater part of the Judges put their suffrages into the pot
of doubtfulnes: then his cause is deferred over til another day, and to the
better discussion of the Judges: if he be absolved, he has no more to do but
is presently set at liberty: if his term be prolonged, then there is a new day
appointed both to him and the Judges for the handling of his cause: the
Aduocators accusing him and his Lawyers, as well as they can, refuting the
objected crimes. After that the matter is debated and pleaded on both sides,
the Judges go to their bals again, and if then neither there be any thing
concluded in regard that the greater part of the lots be found in the pot, that
agrees the doubtfulnesse and irresolution of the Judges, then once again is
the cause put over, and a new day appointed both to the prisoner and the
Judges: which being come, and the Judges casting their lots as before, there is
no farther regard held of those that are doubtful, insomuch that if the
lottes be not in either part justly equal, of necessity the prisoner must
be either acquitted or condemned: if he be acquitted, he has (as I said
before) no more to do: but if he be condemned, then they are to determine of
the manner of his punishment: concerning the which both the Aduocators and the
presidents of the Colleges of Judges do make motions. Always The office of
the Aduocators enclyning more to severity the^ mercy. The heads of the forty
and the counselors propound lighter penalties.
the Aduocators do propounde that punishment, which to that sort of offense
does seem most sharp and grievous, their office and duty being more to
incline to severity then to mercy. The other do accustom to propounde
lighter penalties, unless the fault be so heinous, that there remain no place
for pity, or else that the Aduocators have used greater lenity then becomes
their place and office. The opinions of all being proposed, the punishment that
the prisoner must suffer, is in the very same manner and fashion concluded and
determined on (as I told you above) that the decrees of the senate are wont to
be ratified, when the Sages are of sundry and diverse opinions. The manner of
which if I should repeat again, I should trouble the reader with a needless
iteration, and perchance be accounted tedious for my labor: Let this suffice,
that that opinion of the Judges is pronounced and executed, which (the other
being rejected) has in favor thereof more then half the suffrages.

No one citize^ nor magistrate allowed for an absolute judge or arbitrator in
any thing.
Here me thinks I shall not do amiss to acquaint you with two statutes
wisely enacted by our ancestors.

The first is, that they would not by any means, that any citizen, no nor
magistrate, should be an arbitrator without appeal in any thing, but that the
supreme right and judgment of all things should belong to the councels or
colleges. And the other no less profitable then the former is, that the
Judges should not openly with their tongue pronounce their opinions: but
secretly by suffrages, the manner of which you have heard: either of which in my
opinion, grounded upon exceeding reason: First for so great an authority in
determining matters, to have been committed to one magistrate as it had been
dangerous: so if now the matter fall by chance otherwise then well out, the
City cannot find fault with any particular citizens. And with as great
wisdom was it ordained, that judgments and decrees should not be openly
with speech pronounced: for the Judges by this invention of secret suffrages
do judge much more freely then they would have done, if they had been to
deliver their judgments with their tongue, in which case sometimes either
through ambition they would have been seduced from justice, or else feared the
offense of their well deserving friends, or else doubted the indignation and
mislike of some greater person: withal this commodity there is, that every Judge
follows his own judgment, without depending upon the authority of any other
Judge: which might easily happen, that he that had before spoken, were,
reputed to be grave and wise, which point has not been omitted of excellent
Philosophers: but now seeing the whole manner of judgments is of us
expressed: we will return to the forty judges of Capital causes, of which I
had begun to speak. Their College was instituted of our City, to the end
that the Aduocators making report unto them of Capital causes; by their
deliberation, wicked men and malefactors might receive condign correction and
punishment: for unless it be in great and weighty matters, and such as the
commonwealthes may be interessed by the decision of them, the Aduocators do
never consult with the Senate, and very rarely with the great Council: but
all Capital causes are brought to this College of the forty, whose sentence
is held for ratifyed and firm without admitting any appeal. Their office
lasts eight months, after that they have before spent sixteen months in
determining of civil causes. For there are in the common wealths of Venice
three The office of the forty criminal Judges
Courts or Colleges, every one consisting of Forty judges, two of them are for
the judging and determining of civil causes, and the third of which we
speak for Capital: but they are in this sort distributed, that these forty
Capital Judges, so soon as they have finished their lymited time of office,
do return privately into order, and forthwith other forty are chosen into
their places by the session of the great Council, and yet the forty new
chosen, do not presently come to the judging of Capital causes, but in place
of these former Capital Judges, does the other College of Forty succeed,
that did in the mean space of these eight months, exercise the judgment of
civil causes within the City. And again in their place does succeed the
other College of forty, which also in this eight months space, had the
handling of ciuil-foreyne causes, and in their place do succeed these last
forty newly created, and so by turn they pass from foreyn causes to causes of
the city, and lastly to those which are capital, in which judgments, from one
as I say to another they continue two years. These three courts of judges have
their three peculiar appellations. The first of forreyne causes is called the
new College, the second of homeciuil causes, the old, and the third that
judges upon life and death, the criminal College: these last forty, beside
the high power of their judgment in capital offenses and crimes are also
admitted into the Senate, and have in that honorable Council also their
authority of sufrages. They have besides three heads or presidentes of their
company, which are every two months chosen new by Lot, and in their turns
they sit with the Duke and Councellers, and have with them equal authority of
making report over of whatsoever they shall please, either to the Senate or to
the great Council, the same nevertheless in such manner as I told you
before: neither without reason are these forty younger men mingled with the
Senators, which are for the most part old men in regard that the heat of
their nature makes a temperature with the others coldness, yet are not these
young men equal in number to the old men, but much fewer, only enough to put
some heat into the cold deliberatio^s of the Senate; which sometimes exceeding
and in matters of some nature is necessary. Besides by this grant of Senator
like authority to the forty, there may seem to be in some forte a
communication of the commonwealths government, with the lower and meaner sort
of citizens, such as for the most part they are that do exercise this office of
the forty* wherein our auncesters have seemed to use and observe a certain
kind of popular law: for to every of these three Colleges of forty men there
is a certain rated allowance of money appointed and given for every day that
they shall assemble and meet, and therefore very seldom do those that are
rich, require this office, and if they should, they would as easily be
repulsed. The honor thereof being without difficulty granted to the needier
sort, provided always, that their life bear with it the fame of an honest
conversation: by which means the poverty of mean gentlemen is not only in
some sort provided for, but alsoo the government and administration of the
common wealth, is as well in some sort communicated with the meaner and poorer
sort of Citizens, as with those that are highliest remarkable either for
riches or nobility, which custom has a reference to the popular estate. By
these things you may perceive that there appears in eueriy part of the
Venetian common wealth, that moderation, and temperature, which in the
beginning of this work, I told you our auncesters did so highly endeavor to
establish, which is, that the popular estate should have an intelligence and
mixture with that of the nobility, yet the same in that order seasoned, that
the parts of the Nobility should be both more in number and mightier in sway.

We have now in my opinion sufficiently discoursed both of the Aduocators, as
also of the forty criminal Judges* who are to that end instituted, that they
should carefully look into all such offenses as are any way notorious, either
through the quality of the offense, or the condition of the offender: Now the
time Two sorts of inferior magistrates.
requires, that we should briefly speak of some inferior magistrates, that
have authority to punish offenses of less quality, and moment, either in
regard of the means of the fault it self, or the slender regard and quality
of the person that commiteth the same. These also are of two sorts, the one
has power of life and death, the other not, their authority stretching no
farther then to the punishment of Rogues and Harlots, whom they cause to be
imprisoned or whipped with rods, every of them according to the proportion of
their committed lewdnes. The first magistrate also that has power to give
sentence of life and death, is likewise divided into two sorts. For the self
same Judges do not search out and examine and call to trial the offender, but
the first being the heads of the officers by night do thoroughly examine the
cause of Officers of night.

whatsoever else the party has confessed, either of his own accord, or else by

much from the former, and gives sentence of death, when the cause in handling
is capital. But if it be a lighter offense to be punished only with whipping
or imprisonment, the captains of the officers by night, do of themselves
dispatch the matter without asking the advice of the College, either for the
imprisoning or torturing the offender, which authority never thelesse the
office of the Aduocators has not, but must first acquaint the College and
proceed according to the decrees thereof, neither is the same so ordained
without exceeding reason and foundation, for that for every small matter, and
the offense of every baggage fellow, the Council should have been moved, both
the common wealths should have been overmuch troubled with many impertenent
brablers, and also lewd fellows should have had a greater scope of living
licentiously, through the hope of escaping punishment. For greater expedition
thereof, of these kinds of judgments, the heads or chieftaines of the officers
by night do obtain that authority, of which the Aduocators are deprived. These
officers of the night are six, and six likewise are those mean officers, that
have only power to correct base vagabonds and tryfeling offenses.

Those that do execute this office are called heads of the tribes of the city,
because out of every tribe (for the city is divided into six tribes) there is
elected an officer of the night, and a head of the tribe, which custom also we
observe in the election of our Councellers, as here before I have expressed.

The duty of either of these officers is, to keep a watch every other night by
turn, within their tribes and now the one and then the other, to make rounds
about his quarter, till the dawning of the day, being always guarded and
attended on with weaponed officers* and serieants, and to see that there be not
any disorder done in the darkness of the night, which always imboldneth men
ill disposed to naughtiness, and that there be not any houses broken up, nor
thieves, nor rogueslurking in corners with intent to do violence.

At the first beginning of the city, either of these offices was of great
estimation: but since, new Magistrates being added, according to the change of
the times, and the occasion of the common wealth: the same is much diminished
and of lesser respect, for the chief authority being transferred over to the
new officers, there remains only in their courts the decision of base and
baggage matters, as the suddes or lees of the rest.

Hitherto there is enough said of those Magistrates that do determine Capital
causes: In the next volume we will speak of civil Judgments.

shall exceed the sum of five and forty crowns, there is not any magistrate
from whose judgment, the party may not appeal to the Auditors of the civil
causes, and to the college of forty, of whom we have here above made mention.

But to the end that the whole manner of these civil judgments may be made
manifest and plain, we Two sorts of Auditors the old and the new.
will begin with the Auditors, which are of two sorts, that is to say, the old
and the new, the old do derive their name from the antiquity of their
office, The old Auditors more ancient then the new.
and being much more ancient then that of the new, which was altogether unknown
in this commonwealth, till the same began to have Dominion over the maine
Land, many ages after the building of the City. These old Auditors have in
manner the same authority in determination of civil causes, after they are
debated of and judged by the civil judges, as the aduocators have in all such
matters, as any way they shall think to be offensive to the laws, I mean in
receiving of appeals, or making of report over.

When therefore by the civil Judges, there is any sentence given against any
man: it is lawful for him who receives prejudice thereby, to appeal from
their indgement to the Auditors, the cause then being brought into their court,
and of either side pleaded and debated of those between whom the controversy
depends, if the same exceed not the sum of fifty crowns, they may of their
own authority, so they agree all in one end and determine the same, without the
College of the forty: or if they disagree in opinion, then one of them has
authority to make report over Three Judges that have authority to judge and
determine on things that are found,
to a very small College, where the company of either Auditors do note, and
likewise three other Judges, that usually do sit upon things that are found:
and there these lesser affairs are absolutely determined.

But if the whole cause did amount above the rate of the foresaid sum, before
our time the matter could not have been brought into the College of the
Forty, unless someone of the Auditors had interposed himself, and made
report of the sentence so given by the Judges, unto the forty. But in this
time of ours there is a Law made, whereby liberty is granted unto him against
whom the former Judges have pronounced sentence, that he may after three
months (though none of the Auditors intermeddle) call his adversary a fresh
into A law lately made, by which the authority of the Auditors is greatly
diminished.
question by appeal unto the College, by whose law the authority of the
Auditors is greatly diminished: yet nevertheless is their report of great
avail to the furtherance of the cause, and besides the cutting of the delay of
three months, seems to be as a prerogative to the Judges. Presently upon the
Auditors report the former judges were before our time summoned into the
College of the forty, and there either magistrate admitted to the maintenance
of his cause by plea: but now I know not by what negligence by little and
little it is brought to pass, that the former Judges, from whose sentences the
appeal is brought, do neither plead, nor be so much as present at the
handling of their cause in the College of the forty: only being cited by an
officer, their answer is, that, that which law and justice is, may go forward.

But this custom that the auditors should first make report unto the college
of such causes as were by appeal brought unto them, and plead in maintenance
of them, having continued till our time, is now wholly abrogated: and only the
Advocates of those between whom the controversy rests, do use that office,
in defending the cause of their clientes: whereby it is come to pass, that
this office which was before time so honorable, is now become to be greatly
obscured and eclipsed. The judges of civil causes observe the same order in
their judgments as the criminal judges.


These forty Judges of civil causes do in a manner observe that order and
custom in their judgments, as you heard me say before is usually wont to be
observed of the forty Judges of capital causes: only this difference there is
that in causes wherein the life and estate of any man is called in question,
there is no certain time of speech limited or imposed, whereas in A certain
time of speech limited.
civil controversies there is a certain time appointed, beyond which they may
not by any means lengthen or extend their plea: that is to say, an hour and a
half only to each of them that pleads: neither are there in the decision of
these civil judgments many opinions alleged, out of which the College may
conclusiuely choose one that shall be best to their liking, as in consultation
upon the punishment of malefactors, (I told you above is usually the custom)
but it is only here debated, whether the sentence given by the former Judges
shall be confirmed or abrogated: if any of the Auditors make intercession to
that end, then shall the question be of abrogating and cancelling the same:
but otherwise if the matter come unto the College without the intercession or
address of any Auditor, then the Presidentes of the College, after the matter
is of each side thoroughly pleaded, do rather propose the strengthening and
confirming of the former judgment then the disalowance or cancelling thereof.
Presently all the sworn Judges do prepare Three several pots brought forth,
a white, a green* and a red.
themselves and go unto their suffrages, and three pots likewise are brought
forth: in the green the former judgment is cancelled: in the white it is
approved, and in the third which is read, are the balls of those that do
yet remain doubtful, and would have the matter to be adiourned and deferred.
Nothing is held for absolute and decreede, unless more then the half do
conclude and agree together in one opinion, either for the ratifying, or
disanulling thereof: of which if the judges be not thoroughly persuaded, so
that neither of both be decided, the same is then deferred over till the next
day, and the same ceremonies again renewed: and if neither then it be
determined, the College is called again the third day, and the self same
proceedinges used as before, save only that after either side has
sufficiently pleaded, and that they go again to their suffrages, there is no
farther reckoning made of those that remain doubtful and vnperswaded, so that
unless the suffrages be altogether equal, it is determined, and fully ended
one way or other, and the former judgment Upon abrogation of the former

the former judgment the playntife is not so put off and debarred, but that he
has liberty to renew his action again: for this new cancelling serves to
no other end, but only to frustrate and make void and inualide But upon the
confirmation of the former sentence the party interessed is utterly debarred.
the force of the former judgment: whereas the approbation and allowance
confirms and ratifieth for ever the judgment that was given and pronounced,
neither is there left to the defendant, any place either of provocation or
appeal, or mean to call the matter in question, unless there fall out some
new matter or occasion.

This shall be sufficient as concerning the old Auditors: now we will
briefly say somewhat of the new. This Magistrate was unknown and not created
in our commonwealth, till such time as the Venetian Empire began to embrace
the main land that bordered upon our Lakes. To these may appeals be brought
from the judgments and sentences of The New auditors meddle only with
foreign matters.
such governors and magistrates as without the precinctes of our City do
administer justice to people that do live under our subjection: for the old
Auditors were not of themselves able and sufficient to understand and dispatch
both the causes of the city, and those also of forrayne places: for which
cause this Magistrate was called by the name of New, in regard that after the
commonwealth was once settled and established, the city began to stretch and
enlarge her dominion over the maine land of the province of Venetia, which as
though it had never been separated from the same, returned willingly with a
frank and liberal good will. For as I showed you in the beginning of this
work, the noblest sort of people that inhabited the country of Venetia,
flying the barbarous cruelty of foreign nations, and the general deuastation
of all Italy, did get themselves into these lakes of ours, and then did lay
the first foundation Why the City was first called Venetia.
of this most opulent and flourishing city, calling it by the name of Venetia,
to leave thereby a remembrance unto their posterity, that there in the same
were jointly together assembled the chief prime and flower of the nobility of
all the cities of the territories of Venetia: so that in short space, when the
rule and empire thereof began infinitely to increase, one Magistrate could not
serve for the dispatch both of foreign and domestical causes: and therefore
this New Magistrate was The New col ledge of the forty civil judges.
ordained, and likewise the New College of the forty: into whose courts are
brought the appeals from the indgementes of such forrayne magistrates as have
government abroad: where being thoroughly handled and discussed, they are
finally ended and concluded. The manner and form of proceeding in this
college, is such in all points (as before I told you) is observed of the old
Auditors, and the council of the forty civil The council of forty for causes

Judges, concerning causes within the city: only this is added to the
authority of the new Auditors, that in any matter brought unto them by
appeal, so the same exceed not the sum of forty crowns, they may ouerrule
the former judgment, or abrogate it, or allow it either in whole or in part,
as shall seem best unto them, provided, that they do all agree in one opinion:
which The causes of strangers sooner dispatched then those of the citizens.
course was thought fit to be ordained, to the end that forrayners and strangers
(of whom according to the precepts of many great Philosophers there is
especial regard to be had) should not be molested and lingered off with long
delays, but quickly come to an end of their suites. This privilege the old
Auditors have not: for they of necessity must either wholly allow the
judgment, or else utterly cancel and make void the same, and whereas the new
(as I said) may, leaving the rest, meddle only with part of the cause, they
must either embrace the whole entire cause, or else utterly leave it vnmedled
withal. So that by this means thesuites of strangers are sooner ended and
determined, then the causes of the citizens, though through the suttelty of
Advocates and Lawyers (who leave nothing unattempted, how far soever the same
be from right) processes and suites are sundry times drawn out to an infinite
length: as in all places it is usual, where judgments are not rashly
pronounced, but leasurely and considerately at appointed times.

Now (in a manner) have we expressed the whole form which is usually observed
in judgments, it remains that we briefly speak somewhat of those magistrates
who first of all do give sentence in causes of the City, and Six several
kinds of Judges.
from whom the appeals and prouocations are brought to the old Auditors, and to
the council of the forty: of these Judges there are six several courts,
divided according to the quality of the causes and of the persons. For either
the suites are about merchandise, or matters pertaining thereunto, or about
houses or grounds that are within the Lakes, or about possessions and lands
that are on the Continent, or else about other contractes, or bargains: as for
the persons that contend, they are either citizens or strangers, or one with
another strangers and citizens together: or the controversy is between
orphelins, or else moved at the suit of the widows, for the recovery of their
dower after the death of their husbands. Lest therefore there might fall out a
confusion among judgments of so different kinds, to the end that the one
should not be a disturbance or hinderance to the other, there were appointed
several Courts of judgment, in so much that as far forth as possible it
might be, every one according to the quality of his business might know the
proper and peculiar Judge of his controversy: for Judges of the properties.
whatsoever differences arise about houses, grounds, or leases, situated or
lying within the bounds of Venice (that is, being within the lakes) are all
determined by those that are called Judges of the properties, to whose Courts
also widows have recourse in demandes of their dower, after the death of
their husbands. This name and appellation of properties was first given them,
because our ancestors did take those things to be properly their own, which
were seated within the Lakes, as not being easy to be transferred to the
dominion of other masters: as for such goods as they had upon the Continent,
whether they were lands or houses, in regard that they lay open to violence,
and might in dispight of their masters suffer rapine and spoil, they called
by the name of moueables: if then the controversy arise concerning any
possession upon the maine lands, for redress thereof recourse is to be had to
the Judges of the Procurators: Judges of the procurators.
under whom the matters of Orphelins that are yet under gardians are handled,
for among the Venetians both gardians and tutors were wont to be called
Procurators. If the contention and strife do any way concern Merchantes or
matter of merchandise, then for the decision of those causes are there certain
peculiar Judges or Consuls of the merchants.
Judges, called properly Judges or Consuls of the marchantes. These do in their
Judgments use a speedier dispatch then any other of the civil magistrates:
which was so ordained, to the end that marchantes, whose affairs might
otherwise receive great detriment and hinderance, with lingering and delays
might not be deluded or entertained with long expectation of their Judges of
strangers.
right. But if the question be between strangers, or that if any citizen will
sue a stranger that comes to lodge in Venice for some few days, those
Judges must then be repaired unto that are appointed to hear the causes of
strangers, and have thereof their proper nomination and title. But all other
causes of sales, bargains, or contractes, by which any citizen pretends
either breach of covenant or duenesse Judges of requests.
of debt, are referred to the Judges of requests, who serve in stead of the
Mayor or Praetor of the City. There are besides certain small things, whose
judgment Judges of the moueables.
and determination is committed to certain officers, that are called Judges of
the moueables. Likewise there is another kind of magistrate, whose office is,
if any thing happen to be found, that had layne long hidden, or else been
lately lost, to judge and determine Judges of things that are found.
whether the same ought to belong to the common treasure, or to any private man,
or else to him whose chance it is to find it, all things of the like kind and
nature being under the compass of his authority and judgment.

Having expressed the several kinds and manners of Magistrates that have
charge of common treasure.
judgments, we will now pass over to those magistrates that have charge over
the common chamber or treasury, and the receipt and employment of the public
reuenew. These perchance may seem to some body more in number then is
convenient, and that a few might as sufficiently discharge the whole business
pertaining to the treasure: but here they must mark, that our fathers omitted
no kind of heedfulnesse to prevent all fraud and deceit in the
administration of their public treasure, supposing the same to be the very
fountain whence the other parts of the commonwealth receive their nouriture
and sustenance, and likewise grow to an exceeding weakness and empouerishment
by the drying up and decay thereof, in so much that they made a solemn decree,
that what citizen soever should be co^uicted of having abused or defrauded the
common treasure, should be to al posterity defamed with a perpetual note of
dishonor: and the same perpetualy every year should to his eternal shame be
renewed. For upon a certain appointed day the great council is solemnly
assembled, and there in a public oration made by one of the Aduocators, all
such as have been convicted of this crime as named with titles of reproach, to
the end that the shame and infamy of so foul a fact may never grow out of
date or be forgotten.

The magistrates who have charge over the treasure are of two sorts.
But returning to the purpose: The magistrates who have charge over the
Treasure are of two sorts, as likewise is the treasure it self, for either it
consists of the public rentes, revenues, and tributes, or else when great
and important occasions shall so require the same, is raised of taxes and
subsidies that are levied according to the ability of the citizens: which
oftentimes happens, when wars with which our city has been much afflicted,
do grow upon us either by sea or land, as when the Turk incrochingly
assaileth our dominions, whose mighty puissance and formidable attempts as well
against us, as against the whole commonwealth of Christendom, we alone not
without exceeding charge and detriment have resisted and kept at a baye many
years, or else when christian princes not brooking the greatness of the
Venetian empire, have conspired against the same, as in the fifteenth year
before this, in manner all the greatest princes of christendom were strongly
linked, leagued and confederated against us: but God be thanked: their
endeavors were withstoode, and our affairs though for a while declining, were
yet at length restored into their former estate and flourishing erected
grearnesse.

Seeing then that this common treasure consists of two kinds, two likewise
are the kinds of magistrates to whose charge they are committed. The one for
the subsidies levied of the people: and the other for the common rents and
tributes: These tributes are levied either of goods transported out of the
City, or else of such as are brought into the same: others the like also are
collected and gathered out of those other cities that are under the Venetian
dominion. The tributes Tolles, and customs of the city, as well through the
great abundance of merchandise, and infinite assembly of merchants, as also
the innumerable multitude of people that dwell within the same, are far
greater then a man would imagine, and as the kinds of these matters and
merchandise are diverse, so likewise are the officers over them instituted and
ordained, as it best seemed unto the^, to whose supremecharge and
superintendance they belong to acquaint you with the particularities and
peculiar offices of every one of which would rather breed a vain and werisome
tediousnes, then any necessary or pleasing delight, for which cause I thought
it not amiss to ouerslippe those magistrates, whose offices are not of
continuance, but are only instituted upon occasions. In sum the chiefest
point belonging to all these officers is to be heedefull that no part of this
common treasure be embezeled, misemployed or carelessly regarded, all
controversies likewise arising about this money, are by them judged and
determined, so so e as they have gathered in their money, they carry The
Gouernour^ of the public rents.
the same to the governors of the public Rents: for so is this magistrate
called, to whose presidence this matter is committed: which because it is a
very great and a very honorable charge, the same is not wont to be given, but
unto the noblest citizens, which to the end they should the more willingly of
themselves desire, or at least not refuse the same, being proffered, as the
burden and care there of, is great and weighty: so are there thereunto many
both profitable and honorable The creation of the under Officers belongs to
the governors the common Treasure.
authorities annexed for the creation of all such under officers, as are paid
out of the common treasure, as Serieants, Somners, Purseuants, Ordinary
gardes, and therest of that kind, lies wholly in their power, whom having
satisfied and paid, they bring the rest The Treasurers of the Chamber of the
City*
that remains to the Treasurer, at the Chamber of the City: to which
magistrate finally is brought the whole sum of the common money collected
either within or without the town, by whatsoever officer or treasurer, and
they do again employ the same upon public uses, according to the order and
direction of the Senate: keeping a Register both of their receipts and
paymentes, which office because it requires a painful travel and continual
diligence, the same is wont to be given to the younger sort of the nobility,
provided always that they be such, whose sincerenesse and integrity of life do
no way degenerate from the nobleness of their stock, to the end that the
public money be not privately misemployed, and these treasurers of the City
have in manner as great authority in the Senate as the other lawful Senators:
Peculiar Officers appointed over such money as is levied by taxation.
but as for the money which in the necessities and distresses of the
commonwealth is leauied of the citizens by way of taxation: though at length
the same come as to the treasurer of the town Chamber, yet are there peculiar
and proper officers thereunto assigned sometimes upon an occasion of collecting
a sum of money, the Senate makes a decree for the raising thereof without
any clause of restirution, interest, or utility to return back to those of,
whom it is levied, which happens nevertheless very seldom, for commonly,
or rather always, unless extreme occasion require the contrary, the Senate
(as their chiefest care is directed to the general good of the commonwealth:)
so also have they a most especial and singular regard of the particular
estate of the citizens.

The sum that is to be levied being determined, and time appointed for the
payment thereof; every one brings in as much thereof, as he was rated at,
which is exacted and gathered in, by the governors of the rentes, and by them
brought to the Treasurers of the Chamber. But oftentimes upon these taxations
of money the Senate limits and appointes a time for restitution thereof unto
the Citizens, with some allowance Interest allowed unto the citizens for such
money as is levied of them.
also of profit, and interest for the same, and to that end are there certain
rentes and determinate tributes assigned and made over, but before our time the
Senate sundry times were wont to make a decree concerning this exacted sum
of money that there should not be made any mention of restitution, nor any time
thereunto appointed, unless the same should be for the general good and
benefit of the common wealth, only the magistrate, which was called president
of the lones, and as yet retayneth that name, recorded President of the Lones.
in a book, the several sum contributed by every particularr citizen, and
in the mean time till the same were repayed, there were allowed five crowns
in the hundred, to every one of those that had been taxed, and thereunto were
sundry rentes appointed, so that in those ancient wars it was an easy
matter to levy money by this manner of taxation, and surely in my opinion it
was a thing very just and reasonable, that somewhat should be again restored
unto them out of the common reuenew, that had in the necessary times of the
common wealth, spent and empayred their substance: for as the parts ought to
have regard to the safety of the whole, so in natural reason also ought the
whole to defend and preserve the parts, in as much as may be from all
inconvenience and wrong, and to participate with them some part of the common
nouriture, thereby to restore and enharten them, but in our time this debt of
levied money was so excessive and great, that the very interest thereof, after
the rate I spoke of, amounted to three hundred thousand Crowns by the year,
which payment being of late, by reason of the extreme necessities and
dangerous wars, wherewith the commonwealth was environed, withholden, and
kept back, now finally, some four year since, there was a statute and decree
enacted by the Senate, (the motioners and perswaders thereof being Dominico
Treuisano, Andrea Gritti Duke Venice.
a grave and honorable Councelor, and Andrea Gritti, a Senator of singular
prudence and integrity, who now to the general contentment and exceeding
happiness of our commonwealth, we acknowledge for our Duke and Prince) that
there should not thence forward be any mention made of paying any yearly
interest, neither that any suits, kind of subsidy, or contribution should
thereafter be registered or enrolled in the common books, and yet least the
citizens should think themselves defrauded: it was provided that they should
be paid their principal, and likewise the interest, due until the day of the
decree, for satisfaction of which they appointed out, not only An Officer
appointed for the payment of the rownes debtes.
a great part of their tributes, but also the whole possessions belonging to the
common wealth in the teritorie of Rouigo. The meddling in which business happened
partly to my lot in regard of an office that I then bare, instituted of
purpose before our times to diminish and lessen the debts of the common wealth,
or if it were possible, utterly to extinguish them, of which I will speak
somewhat hereafter, and so a great part was discharged of those heavy and
unmeasurable debtes, with which the commonwealth was burdened, and likewise
the estate of the private citizens, not left vnconuenientlie regarded, yet
always so that the general good was first provided for, and then the private,
which order is descended even to our times from our auncesters, from hand to
hand.

Now then to turn our speech thither again wherein we digressed. The
Presidentes of the lones are those that do gather together the money wherein
the Citizens are taxed at such times as the commonwelth needs their help,
of which when in their books they have taken a particular note and reckoning,
then finally they deliver the same over to the Treasurer of the Chamber of the
City, from whom it belongs to their charge to exact such sums of money,
as were yearly accustomed to be yielded in stead of rent to the private
Citizens: and likewise to register up in their books both the receipt and
expense thereof. But this money which by the Senates decree is levied of the
Citizens, and is after a certain time to be restored unto them again, was
wont both to be collected and repayed by a certain peculiar Magistrate
thereunto appointed: Now this office Officers that do seize and sell the goods
of those that do not at the time appointed pay the money in which they are taxed.
belongs wholly to the Governors of the Rentes. There is also an other
money-Magistrate not to be omitted, to whose office it appertains to search,
seize, and to sell openly the goods of such as do not at the time appointed
pay the sum of money at which they are taxed. There are also other
money-Magistrates, that do seek out the endebted Citizens, and do as well
peruse the books of account of private men, as also those of the commonwealth,
to the end that the treasury and commonwealth may not any way be defrauded,
which for avoiding tediousness I will ouerpasse, because they are not of any
moment, to that order and government of our common wealth which I have taken
upon me to describe.

Presidents over the coin or mintmaisters.
Besides these heretofore mentioned, there are also certain other magistrates,
whose offices are of great avail, to the commodity, quietness, honor,
health, and happiness of our Country, and therefore not to be ouerslipped in
silence. First are the masters of the coin as well gold, as silver, the
current goodness of which as yet entertaineth the willing trafique of
strangers: so is it comfortable and commodious to the Citizens within
themselves: then the cornmaisters, and health masters of Venice, both being
Corn masters. Health masters. Presidentes of the Arsenall.
of great and exceeding consequence, as likewise are the worshipful Presidentes
of the Arsenall. Then are there certain officers, such as among the Romans
Aediles.
were called Aediles, to whose care belongs the mending and repayring of the
streets and Bridges, and other the like matters of that kind and office,
exceedingly requisite and necessary in this common wealth of ours, and lastly
the office of those whom Procurators.
the Venetians call procurators, being of great dignity and singularly auailable
to the City.

Of the Presidents of the money or Mintmaisters I know not what I should say
more, then that their chief charge and care is, that the gold and silver be
not coined in any baser allay, then that which by the law is appointed, neither
that the same bear any whit less weight then it should do: which has been
of us all most religiously observed, insomuch that the money of Venice is of
great account, and runs current as well among the barbarous Nations, as it
does in Christendom. For whereas all other Christian Princes in a manner,
cause their money to be stamped in a baser allay, to the end to make it stretch
the farther: ours have always herein most constantly retained that dignity
which they received of their auncesters.

The magistrate that has the charge for the provision of corn is exceedingly
necessary to this city of Venice, because there being but a small quantity of
corn to be gathered out of the territory of Venice, and the city being most
populous, and round about encompassed with lakes, of necessity there is great
care to be had of these provisions: least the people whose benefit and
commodity was so exceedingly of our ancesters respected through dearth and
scarsity of corn, might fall into the extremity of Famine. There are
therefore appointed three masters or overseers of this matter of corn, whose
Magistracy endures sixteen months: their office and charge is carefully to
provide that the City be never at any time afflicted with the scarcity of
corn, of which if at any time they stand in doubt, they presently repair unto
the Duke, and to the College of the Sages, and there the matter being well
debated, do at length determine what course is therein best to be taken.
Sometimes there is a certain reward and recompense out of the common treasure
appointed to those that shall from far countries transport any corn to
Venice. Sometimes they bargayne with merchantes for the undertaking to bring by
a certain time such quantity of corn as they shall agree upon to Venice, from
out of foreign regions, and for the same to be paid out of the public
treasure, which promise unless the marchantes faithfully perform, they are by
the senate amerced in a great sum of money. And whereas the commonwealth
buyeth this corn dearly and at a great rate: it sells the same again to
the common people very good cheap, and at a small price, suffering sometimes
therein a great and exceeding loss.

There are besides this many other excellent laws and decrees concerning this
matter of corn, which if I should perticularly rehearse, I should digress
farther from my purpose then were fit.

Now follows that Magistrate to whose providence and care all such things as
tend to the health and holesomenesse of the city do appertain. His chiefest
office is to foresee, that there come not into the city any contagious
infection, which if at any time it happen to creep in (as sometimes it
chances) then to take such diligent and careful order, that in as much as may
be the same come not to spread any further. To which end there are certain
goodly commodious houses built in the lakes three miles off from the city, and
adjoining near unto them there are gardens of great pleasure, into which houses
if any of the people fall sick, he is presently conveyed with his whole
family: and those that have had any conversation with him that is so fallen
sick, to the end they infect not others, must also (leaving their own
mansions) be removed to other public houses built to the same use, but in a
part without the city quite contrary to the other, where they are constrained
to remain the space of forty days: if during which time they continue sound
and well, then they are suffered to return to the city and to their dwelling
places. There is also a great care had of their household stuff, least by the
contagion thereof, any one should get infection. This Magistrate likewise has
a care that there be not any stinking or rotten meat, or any other unwholesome
thing sold, that might any way offend or be noisome to the health of the
City. Finally his only care is to prevent infection and sickness, and to
preserve pureness and health within the city: This office was instituted not
long before our time; whereas before the city was sundry times so mortally
afflicted with the plague, that whole families flying the infection thereof,
leaving their proper habitations, forsook the town, and went to the next
countries upon firm land. But since the creation of this new magistrate (Gods
goodness be thanked) there has not been (in a manner) any pestilence at all:
though sometimes (as in such a marvelous concourse of people out of all parts
can hardly be avoided) some houses have been infected: but by the diligence
of this magistrate, and especially Gods favor assisting him therein: the
disease has not taken root, nor been suffered to spread it self abroad.

The government and manner of the Arsenall.
Now we come to speak of the honorable government of our Arsenall: the same
being a singular ornament not only to Venice it self, but generally (such is
the stateliness and glory thereof) an honor and dignity to all Italy,
because it is a matter of infinite magnificence and majesty, and worthy of all
admiration.

The Arsenall is built on that side of the city, which of all others is
nearest to the maine sea, hollowed out into three bosoms, or to speak more
properly, into three divided entries, into every of which the sea enters by
one only gate, the same being so large, that it is capable of the greatest
Galleys* This gate is fortified on each side with two strong Towers, which are
joined together with a mighty drawbridge, and a huge percullisse, which are
never opened but upon the occasion of letting Galleys out or in. There is no
other passage to go into the inner parts of the Arsenall, but only by this
gate. The first bosom or entry within the same, though it be the least of the
three, yet notwithstanding it is very great and spacious: being roofed, covered
and tyled round about on every side in manner of certain vaults, under which
the galleys that are come from sea do repose til new ocasion fall out of
employing them safe and free from the annoyance either of wind or weather, so
that they continue many years sound and good: likewise under these vaultes do
they build their new Galleys, and mende and make up their old: a work surely
of great goodlinesse and glory, and most fit and commodious for the
maintenance of a navy. Next this bosom or gully there is an inwarder
maruellously great and large, ordered round of every side with such vaultes as
I spoke of: of which vaultes you shall not see any one empty: but in those
that are wide two Galleys, and in the narrower one at least.

The third, being not much inferior to the second in largeness, was but a
little before our time added to the two former, and is compassed about with
goodly walls, and builded with many vaults, which though they be not all as yet
finished: yet daily they are diligently in hand, about the ending and
accomplishing thereof. There is only one way by which men go from one to the
other: and on the outside they are compassed all about with one wall,
distinguished here and there with certain towers, in the which there are
nightly watches kept to prevent the danger of fire, the treachery of any ill
disposed person, or any other casualtie, whereby so goodly and excellent a
work might come to be spoiled or defaced. Within the walls are certain
rooms, replenished with all manner of Nauale instruments, and all kinds of
artificers thereunto belonging, have there their workehouses and shops. There
great quantities of brass are melted for the making of their artillery: and
likewise there are also made infinite provisions of gunpowder: so that within
the Arsenall there wants not any thing which appertains to the affairs of
the sea: There you may behold an infinite number of workmen, every one
exercising his own particular trade and office.

There are besides these certain great and ample rooms, wherein there is
always ready an unmeasurable abundance of armor, weapons, and artillery of
all sorts: likewise of sails, cables, tacklings, ankers, oars, and such like,
every kind laid up seperately by it self. In so much that when the senate
shall determine to set forth a navy, all things thereunto belonging are
ready in a moment. All these things and several works are under the
authority of this Magistrate, of which I determined to speak: he makes
choice as well of the Carpenters, as of the smithes and tryers of metal and
all other kinds of workmen belonging to the business of the sea, having care
that each of them perform his business with diligence: for the payment of all
which Nauale works and other charges thereunto belonging, there is money
delivered unto him out of the common treasure. The Colleges allowance being
therein first demanded, and they made acquainted with his reckonings. This
magistrate, in the time of our ancestors was of singular reputation and
honor: but in these times of ours the same is much diminished and of less
estimation. In so much that when any great occasion happens, requiring
extraordinary diligence and care, the senate electing certain counselors of
the grauest and best experimented sort, does appoint the managing of those
weighty sea business unto them, appointing the others to be by them wholly
directed.

Now last of all we are to speak of the Procurators The procurators of Saint
Mark.
of Saint Mark, being of all the other magistrates the greatest and most
honorable next unto the Duke. For their time of authority is not limited, but
continues during life. To this honor is also adjoined the perpetual dignity
and place of a Senator: and equal power of suffrages with the lawful Senators:
and this they have besides above all other magistrates, that whereas the elder
citizens do not give any pre-eminence of place to the other, but only in
certain courts the honor thereof is always and in every place yielded to
the Procurators: for in what Court or place soever they sit, they are ever
alike honored with the highest place, as though they did in every place
perform the office of the magistrate there presiding. Their office is to take
upon them the defense and tutorshippe of Orphelins, who being under age, and
their fathers dead without making any will, have not any tutor or ouerseer
appointed them: for which cause this charge and office is never given to any,
but to such as are thoroughly known to be of singular good conscience and
integrity of life, and have passed (in a manner) through all the other offices
of the city, without any touch of dishonor, and a general approbation of an
uncorrupted virtue: and so at length after their long service to the
commonwealth, do obtain therein this great and principal dignity, which
continues with them during their lives.

In times passed this office was of passing great and honorable estimation,
not only within Venice, but also in forrayne regions, in so much that not
only the subjects and near borderers, but also forreners and strangers, made
them by testament their executors, and put wholly into their hands the
administration of their goods, during the minority of their children. Likewise
great sums of money are committed to them, to be by their discretion
dispensed and bestowed among the poor, so that in these times of ours great
and mighty sums of money are committed to their fidelity, as well to the use
of Orphelins, and the poor, as otherwise. This office was at the first
instituted, to the end that the heritages and substances of those citizens
that should either die in service of their country, or in traficke of
merchandise among foreign nations, should not be by fraud misemployed or
diuerted from their heirs. This charge and confidence therefore is especially
given to those, whose conscience, behavior, and conversation, a long
approouedexperience has allowed for excellent, and without exception.

The addition of new procurators from time to time.
At the first beginning they were only three that did exercise this office.
Afterward upon the increase of the cities greatness, three more were added
unto them, but their authority so divided, that the old should still retain
the charge of those pupilles and Orphelins which are on the farther side of the
channel that runs through the middle of the City, and the new to have the
government and looking to of those that are on this side, half of the city
belonging to the charge of the former three, and half to that of the later
three. Besides these there are other three that are (as it were) patrons of the
royal, sumptuous, and magnificent Temple of Saint Mark, under the protection
of which blessed and holy Evangelist the commonwealth of Venice being directed
with excellent laws, has at length increased into this greatness of empire,
and of these last as of the noblest they all do take their name, and are called
Procurers of Saint Mark. I will not at this present say any thing of the
gorgeous architecture of this Temple, nor of the abundance of beautiful
marbles, nor of the multitude of goodly pillars, nor of the glorious works as
well gilded and carved, as richly wrought in Porphire and Jasper stone, of
which the whole roof and pillars are made, yea and the very pauementes:
because I think there are very few but have seen the same, or at least
heard the fame of the magnificence thereof. These three Procurators have
charge continually to look to the maintayning of this goodly Temple, and
amending the decays thereof, as also to the priests, to the end that divine
service may therein be said, according to the dignity of our city, and the
worthiness of our blessed patron and advocate S. Mark. These therefore in my
judgment, beyond al other magistrates are most necessary and expedient in this
prosperity and happiness of our city. The careful usage of the mint is a
matter not lightly to be esteemed, because nothing strengthens more the
trafick and trading of a city, then the purity and goodness of the money:
neither is the careful provision of corn a matter of light regard: likewise
the providing for the health of the citizens, and the repairing of ways,
bridges and common buildinges are offices of singular avail, fitness and
necessity. All these things are (in a manner) common to every other city.
But this other chiefly and above all the rest pertayneth unto Venice, that is
to say, the careful provision and superintendance of sea matters and the
defense of Orphlins, because many of the Citizens, aduenturing their lives
abroad, either about the public business, or else in traficke of merchandise
come to end their days, and therefore these magistrates are ordained to the
end to defend their children from wrong, whereby it may appear to those that
shall consideratelie, and with an indifferent eye look into the order, and
government of this common wealth, that our ancesters did not omit anything that
might tend to the common benefit and good of their Country.

The end of the fourth book.
The Fifth Book of the Magistrates and commonwealth of Venice.
Seeing that the whole form, and order of the government of our common wealth,
is in manner of us already expressed, and the office and order of the
magistrates within the City, I think I shall not do a thing unpleasing, or
unfit for the matter I have in hand, if I speak somewhat of The government
abroad

those I mean that have rule, and authority in such cities, as are under the
subjection of the state of Venice, then of our militare charges and The offices
of the citizens that are not nobly born.
governments, and lastly of the offices of the other citizens, that are not
within the order of nobility, which being declared and made manifest, I may
and that as I trust without reprehension conveniently, and with the conclusion
and shutting up of this work.

The manner used by the Venetians in governing such Cities as are under their
subjection.
Over the nobler Cities of the state, there are appointed four magistrates,
one only Governor does justice to all, determining and sentencing all causes
as well civil as criminal: This Governor has always sitting with him in
judgment, men skillful in the laws, whose counsel he uses, though the whole
authority rest in himself. Besides him there is a Captain general commander
over the soldiers of that territory, as well those that are in garrison in the
cities, as those that are encamped or lodged abroad in the country, over
them has the Governor no charge at all, but only the Captain general,
besides the care of the Castle, the walls and the Gates are committed to the
Captain likewise of the rentes and tributes, as well of the city, as of the
whole country belonging unto it, besides these, there is a Treasurer, or two
that administreth, pays, and recouerth the public money, and keeps the
books and register of the public accountes: but he does not any thing
without the commandment of the Captain and sometimes both of the Captain and
the Governor, which manner of administration seemed much more fit, then if
both the authority and the handling of the money, should have been committed
to one of them alone: whereby the public treasure might much more easily have
been embezeled and misspent: but the money that remains overplus, above the
charges of the Province, is carried to Venice, and delivered to the Treasurers
of the City, to whose office as I said before the public money is brought
from all parts. The fourth magistrate of authority in every principal City,
is the Liuetenant of the Castles, in some places there is but one, and in some
more, they command over those soldiers that are in garrison of the Castles,
and have the charge of such weapons, victual, artillery, and munition as are
within the Castle: yet the Lieutenant has not so absolute authority within the
Castle, but that he is always subject to the commandment of the captain
general, to whose authority and power all things of that kind are wholly
attributed: but in lesser cities or towns there is no captain general: all
things being there under commandment of the Governor. Likewise in such
towns as are within the precinctes of greater cities, the Governor only
administreth right to the townsmen, and no other magistrate, though the
Treasurers and captains have also authority throughout the whole Territory of
the chief Cities, from all these Governors appeal may be brought to the new
Auditors, sometimes also the Aduocators were wont to sit with the Governors
upon sentences of life and death: but because thereby judgments were
oftentimes delayde, and lewd persons in the mean time not punished, there was
a law made by the college of the ten, that the Aduocators should not have any
farther authority in such judgments as were given by the governor, but that
he should only use the advice of such Doctors of law as before I said were to
sit with him in judgment.

And this in my opinion already said, may suffice concerning the magistrates
by whom our common wealth is gonerned both abroad and at home

But seeing there is as well a reckoning to be made of managing wars, as of
maintaining peace, which whosoever wholly do reject, cannot as Plato says in
his Polytiques, long defend and maintain themselves in freedom and liberty:
But those that have left unto their posterity the true directions of a
commonwealth, commended the use of both, to the end that in times of war,
they should not be unfit for the exercises thereof, and that in peace they
might live in honest exercises under the laws and statutes of their Country,
so that always the virtue and exercises of war have a reference to the
studyes of peace, as being of the two the most excellent and desirable, for
such is the very force, working, and operation of nature it self in every
thing, that first it should covet and seek, that which is to it self
conueuient, and then resist and defend themselves from that which is contrary
thereunto, which in all living creatures that are created, with any perfection
of nature is easy to be discerned: for there is none of them which wants a
desire leading him to that which to his nature is most agreeable, and likewise
there is adjoined to the same a force and ability to be angry, which Plato
places in the heart, to the end that through the stirring thereof every
creature might be prone to resist and repel that which is to his nature
noisome and contrary, the first seeds then of either of these parts being by
nature placed in the minds of men as being of all other creatures the most
perfect: ought of civil men to be embraced, that they may bring forth the
fruits of either effect, that is, both of war and peace, which course was
not neglected of our ancesters, howsoever to some it seem otherwise: for
though the city being builded in the sea, and at the first for many years
careless of extending their dominion and rule over the continent, did not apply
themselves to land wars, yet did they with marvelous glory of success bend
themselves to wars by sea, atchiuing therewith many notable exploits, as well
in defense of their own liberty, as in revenge of injuries done the^ by their
enemies, and many great and glorious deeds of the Venetians do yet remain in
ancient record, and many triumphs and victories wrested by sea, from fierce
and puissant nations, whereby it is easy to conjecture of the mightiness of
the Venetians by sea in forepassed times, but in the end yielding to the
instant petition of the oppressed bordering people, who could not endure the
rapines and cruelties of several tyrants, that had brought them into
subjection, they sent forces into the mayneland, and expelling the tyrants, did
with an infinite applause and willingness of the people receive all those
Provinces of their old consideration into their protection, as though they had
never been disunited thereby setting them free from out the servitude of
insolent strangers, which being the remainder and offspring of those Barbarians,
that had wrought that general deuastation in Italy, had then nestled themselves
and held the people in a most cruel and miserable bondage.

This increase therefore of dominion being added to the former greatness of the
city, their desire and endeavor was not only to comfort and cherish this new
received people with wholesome and profitable laws, but also to find out
means, whereby to maintain and preserve their recovered freedom and
tranquillity: but the situation of their City being in the sea, on the other
side utterly diuerted their minds from wholly applying themselves to land
wars, as well through the inconueniency of the City thereunto, as also for the
avoiding of civil disturbance and tumult, for of necessity those citizens: to
whose lot the managing of these said wars should have befallen, might have
spent the greater part of the year upon firm land, as well to ride and
practice their horses, as also to inure and exercise themselves in sundry
manners of skirmish, and kinds of fight: and withal for their better skill in
military and martial affairs, it should have been necessary for them, when
occasion of employment wanted at home to frequent foreign wars, thereby
as well to confirm their courages, as to strengthen their bodies, and so to
enable themselves in that function, for the service of their country, whereas
otherwise, without this kind of exercise, they would have been until either
to command as captains, or to obey his scutchions. But now this their
continual frequentation of the continent and diuorcement* as it were from the
civil life, would without doubt have brought forth a kind of faction
different and disioyned, from the other peaceable Citizens, which parcialitie
and division would in time have bred civil wars and dissentions within the
City, I omit in the mean time to speak of those high and ambitious thoughts,
that such would have entertained, as did see themselves mighty in arms, and
followed with affecting troops of unquiet soldiers, who according to the
nature of men enclining still to the worse, might easily be stirred to
mischief, which The overthrow of Rome proceeding through the mightines of her

only cause among the Romans (as many of their ancient histories do notably
remember) wrought strange effects in sundry of their Citizens, provoking them
to disobey, and set at naught the laws of the Senate, and their country, and
finally Julius Caesar exceeding the limits of all respect, to tyrannize over
that commonwealth, to which he did owe all duty and obedience. To exclude
therefore out of our estate the danger or occasion of any such ambitious
enterprises, our auncesters held it a better course to defend their dominions
upon the continent, with forreyn mercenarie soldiers, than with their
homeborn citizens, and to assign them their pay and stipende out of the
tributes and receipts of the Province, wherein they remained: for it is just,
and reasonable, that the soldiers should be maintained at the charge of those
in whose defense they are employed, and into their warfare, have many of our
associates been ascribed, some of which have attained to the higest degree of

amplified and enlarged the bounds of the Venetian Empire, was in eternal
memory of his great and glorious actions honored of our commonwelth, with his
statue on horseback, set up and erected in the fairest and goodliest place of
our City. The Citizens therefore of Venice, for this only cause are deprived
of the honors belonging to wars by land, and are contented to transfer them
over to strangers: to which end there was a law solemnly decreede, that no
Gentleman of Vevice should have the charge and commandment of above five and
twenty soldiers, though the same law has not been in these times of ours
altogether observed but through the course of custom in a manner abrogated, by
reason of the many and sundry wars, wherewith we have been encombred, so
that now when we have any wars by land, there are some of Legates or
proueditors.
our Gentlemen sent into the Army, who therein do bear office and authority,
while the war endures, as namely, the Treasurers, and Legates, who never
stir from the side of the Captain General of our Army, who is always a
stranger, which has no authority to do or deliberate any thing without the
advice of the Legates. The war being ended, either Magistrate returns home,
giving up his authority, and putting himself into order, and this is wholly
the manner of the Venetians warfare by land. But for wars by sea and
navigations, both our city is much more thereunto opportune and commodious, as
also our people much more thereunto by nature addicted and inclined, for our
City lying seated in the sea, needs not greatly fear any harm from
forreyne land armies, and as for it self to have fostred or nourished forces
to send unto land wars, thereby to wrong or provoke the bordring people,
that had not only been unjust, but also very incommodious: only from sea
therefore was their danger, and the same great, if they should not have been
thoroughly furnished with means of defense. Therefore did the City turn all
their care to strength and puissance by sea, trayning up their youth, and
framing their whole manner of life thereunto.

The education of the Venetian gentlemen.
For the education of their gentlemen has always been such, that from their
infancy till such time as the hears of their beards begin to appear, they
should be under the tutorship of schoolemaysters, and instructed in learning
according to their capacities: and from thence forward (except some few wholly
addicted to some profession of learning) they should apply themselves to
navigations, being thereunto (as it were) even drawn by their own inclination
and nature. Many do sail into far regions, as well by trafique to increase
their substance, as also by experience to gain the knowledge of the government,
laws, conditions and customs of other countries. Many put themselves into the
galleys of war, there enuring and practicing their bodies to labor, and
their minds to the knowledge of the excellent art of Nauall discipline, in
which the Venetians have (as I say always) been worthily renowned. And there
is an ancient law, continuing even till these times of ours in force and vigor,
that there should be a yearly Encouragement for young gentlemen to to frequent
the sea.
stipend allowed out of the common treasure to two young men of the nobility in
every armed galley, only thereby to breed in them a skilfulnesse in matters
pertaining to the sea: for the better attayning to the which there are
ordinarily certain offices assigned unto them, in the exercise of which they
do both profit themselves, and become better enabled to the discharge of
greater matters. But to every of the greater galleys there are These as I
suppose are those which they call Galleasses.
commonly assigned eight young men of the nobility, with a yearly great
allowance and stipend, either out of the common or private men's treasure,
accordingly as those Galleys are destinated either to the wars or
merchandise, and this to no other end, but only to accustom them to sea
services: it is also ordained by a law having principal relation to the common
utility, that every private merchant shall in the ship wherewith he
trafiqueth, allow a yearly pensio^ to one or two young gentlemen, according to
the burden and ability of his ship. To which young men is also granted a
liberty and privilege that they may within the galleyes of burden, or ships
of private men, to which they are assigned, carry a certain quantity of
merchandise, without paying for the lading thereof any custom or toll, and if
they have not, or will not carry any themselves, they may sell and pass over
their right to do the same, to any other that they shall think good: wherein
there was not only a regard had to the exercise of the youth, but also to the
poverty of many of the meaner citizens that are in any sort distressed: so
that any man may easily perceive, that the institution of our youth to warlike
exercises was not (as some do suppose) neglected of our ancestors, but that
there were two hundred young men of the nobility at least, trained up in these
ships and Galleys at other men's charges: and besides there was not any of the
gentlemen, but that was either brought up to learning, or else to this seafaring
and maritime discipline benefiting thereby not only their country, but also
sundry times exceedingly increasing their wealths and substance.

These ancient laws and goodly institutions do still continue even till this
time of ours, though sundry young men, being since the increase of our dominion
corrupted either with ambition, or riot, have neglected their country
customs, and withal the number of citizens is so increased, that through
these late afflictions of the war, and the many charges growing upon them,
there are many more fallen into poverty, then by the benefit of this law may
be sufficiently relieved: for such is in all worldly things the course of
nature, that nothing may be among men perpetual. But all things howsoever
they seem at the first perfectly and well ordained, yet in course of time
nature still slyding to the worse, they had need to be mended and renewed,
even as a man's body satisfied with his dinners appetite, will not yet
maintain his health, unless it be seconded with a supper: so in every thing
there must be a relief and reparation added to the wearing and always down
declining course of nature, of which remedy herein also (if it please God) we
will have regard: so that there may not any necessary provision be wanting in
this commonwealth of ours. But hitherto of these things: now we will speak of
those officers and magistrates that have charge at sea over our ships and
nauies.

This Captain they call Sopracomit^.
Every Galley being furnished, and in order for the wars, has for Captain
thereof a Gentleman of the state, who has power and authority over all that
are in the Galley, save only that he cannot punish with death: even as in
land wars a captain or a Coronell has authority over those that are under
their companies or regiments: so has this Captain of the Galley over the
mariners and all things that are in the Galley, or tending to the provision
thereof.

Galleys set forth by the Venetians to clear the sea from pirates.
The Venetians do yearly arm forth certain Galleys, though there be not any
other necessity, yet to make the sea safe and secure from pirates, and to
defend from their oppression honest merchantes that cross the seas about their
business, without doing wrong to any man.

Besides these Captains of the Galleyes, there is a Legate The Legate or
lieuetenant of the navy.
over the whole navy, who has full and whole authority over the same, and
over the particular Captains of every Galley. He (as a Lieutenant general of
the army, if the Captain general be not present) has power of life and
death, and authority to direct the navy whether it shall please him.

This magistrate is commonly created in time of peace, and has in his hands
the charge of the Galleys of war: but if the occasions of the commonwealth do
so require, and that there be a great navy indeed to be set out, then there
is appointed and preposed over the whole navy a Captain general with high
and preheminent A Captain general over the navy in manner like unto the Romain
Dictator
authority not only over the same, but also over all maritime provinces in
manner as great, as that the Romain Dictator was wont to have, save only that
this in all things obeys the authority of the Senate, and the decrees of the
commonwealth. Nevertheless his power is singularly great, as well over the navy,
Legates, captains and Lieuetenants of the same, as also over all governors and
magistrates, that have government or superintendence in any of the Islandes or
maritime places: in so much that when the Captain general of the navy shall
come to any City, the clergy is presently to meet him with solemnity, and
the keys of the gates and castles are to be delivered unto him. The authority
of all the other governors for that time cease: and whosoever in whatsoever
cause may appeal from any other magistrate to the Captain general: who only
if it shall so please him, may administer justice, dispose of the public
money, and alone himself exercise the office and authority of all the rest.
There is among the Venetians no magistrate of higher power, and therefore he,
but seldom and upon most urgent occasions created: for not rashly but upon
most weighty and grounded consideration, is this mighty dignity, inuesting a
private citizen with so great and absolute an authority committed to any one.

No General or Captain may return into Venice with armed hand.
Here that law is not to be omitted, by which it was ordained, that no
General, Legate, or Captain of a navy may enter into the city of Venice
with his armed Galleys, no not upon his return homewarde: but presently upon
his arrival at Histria (which province is a hundred miles distant from Venice)
he is to deliver unto the mariners their stipend and pay, and there to
dismiss them, and thence the Galleys are wont to be brought unto Venice by
some few, and to be placed in the Arsenall under the vaultes built for that
purpose, where they are preserved from the injury either of wind or weather:
But now this law is not wholly observed in sort as it was of our ancestors
ordained. We have (in a manner) already reckoned up all the sorts of
magistrates to whom our ancestors have added as a crown or top, those
which by proper appellation derived from the Greek, were wont to be Syndi^ks
or Reuiditors: in Latin they call them Recognitores. So that we may and not
unfitly call them, I think, Overseers, or Examiners.
called Sindiks: we by a new name, but perchance more fit to express their
office, do call them Reuiditors. These are wont every four or five years to
be created, and to be sent into the countries under our dominion, as well upon
the firm land, as also the Islandes and maritime places, and there to look
into, and examine the doings of such magistrates and governors as have there
authority under us: upon whom they use in manner that authority of correction,
as is attributed to the Aduocators. For as Aristotle wisely says: They that
bear rule, unless they depend of others, do (such is the evil sway and bent
of every man's nature) hardly discharge their office well.

We have now reckoned up and made an end of all those offices belonging to
Gentlemen, by whom the commonwealth of Venice does govern either abroad or at
home, it remains that we show you the manner whereby our most prudent
ancestors have retained the common and meaner people in duty: a matter surely
strange and scarcely credible, that the people being so many years deprived of
the public government, did never yet refuse nor unwillingly support the
government of the nobility, neither yet did ever attempt any thing whereby the
form of the commonwealth might be altered, and they received into the
fellowshippe of rule, but have always hitherto faithfully loved and willingly
obeyed the Nobility. But now whosoever, besides the situation of our City
(being in deed most opportune and commodious to maintain a commonwealth) will
consider our moderation and temperance in government shall find that the people
has not been wholly rejected, but received into such offices and charges, as
might be committed unto them without detriment or hinderance of the general
good: and that there has been in this commonwealth of ours that temperature
used, that both elder and later commonwealthes have wanted, the most part of
which were continually disquieted with civil dissentions and popular seditious
tumults: and lastly by them turned up side down and overthrown: whereas in
this city of ours there was never any such sedition or uproar of the people,
For as I said in the beginning it was necessary and fit for the true and
perfect institution of a commonwealth, to exclude the common people from the
government thereof, wherein our ancestors have not only followed the
authority and opinion of many great philosophers, but also imitated Sesastris
that most ancient lawmaker of the Egyptians, who as Aristotle The opinion of
Sostrates the ancient lawmaker of the Egyptians
alleges in his Politiques, would have them that are to defend the
commonwealth with arms, or to consult upon the common good thereof, or to sit
in exercise of justice, to be in their kinds distinguished from husbandmen, and
merchants, and those that do live by mechanical occupations. Nevertheless
easily might this institution overthrow the commonwealth, unless that
temperature be thereunto adhibited which our most wise and foresightfull
ancestors have used.

First therefore among the Venetians this always has been most constantly
observed, that justice should be equally administered to all, and that it be not
lawful for any how great soever, to do wrong or injury to the least of the
lower or meanest people, in so much that it has always been held as a
heinous abomination, and detestable sacrilege, for any gentleman to misuse
Plebeyan one of the common people.
a Plebeian: which if at any time any has rashly, or unadvisedly presumed to
do, he never escaped scotfree: and so much more grievous was his punishment as
he himself was greater in degree and estimation. Besides, there is not any
thing more carefully provided for by the Senate, then that there may be
plenty of corn and of all other things that are necessary either for the
sustenance or safety and healthinesse of the people: in so much that to
preserve the people from want and famine, the common treasure is sometimes
exceedingly spent and wasted: which any man may easily perceive, that shall
attentively mark that which is before expressed, concerning the presidents of
corn, and the healthmaisters of the city. And commonly all people do require
this at the hands of their rulers, that they may live co^modiously and in
plenty, and that they be not subject to the oppressions and injuries of those
that are mightier then themselves: which when they have attained, they go on
with their business secure and careless of the rest: of which there was not any
thing omitted of our ancestors pertaining to those two points: But many things
besides added, whereby the commodities of The relief of the poorer sort.
the people are exceedingly respected, and their poverty carefully relieved,
especially of such that either presently do, or at any time have employed
themselves in honest trades of use and service to the commonwealth, and grow at
length either by age or weakness unable to persevere therein: for in Venice
there are built infinite many houses fitly and commodiously, which are frankely
given to such kinds of men, wherein during their lives they may live and their
Families without charge: besides within the Arsenall (which is so ample and
large, that it represents the show of another town) there is a determinate
stipend and yearly allowance given to a great multitude of men unable either
through age, impotencie, or weakness to do any work, only in regard, that
when in their better times they were able, they had employed their labor in
doing service to the common wealth, likewise by an ancient statute it is
ordained, that in all bargains of buying and selling of rich merchandise, the
one and the The relief of poor mariners.
other, that is both the buyer and the seller, do pay according to the quantity
of the sum, a certain price which is divided among poor mariners, that
having spent their time in that exercise, are through old age unable any
longer to continue therein.

But now besides these good institutions and means to retain the common people
in duty, there are also certain laws, which were as me seems established
with exceeding wisdom of our auncesters; such as thereby both the peoples
ambition, and desire of honor being a humor inseparably possessing the minds
of men, may be throughy satisfied, and yet the government of the Nobility no
way disturbed.

The whole people are divided into two parts, the one of the honester and best
respected sort, the other of the very base common people, as mechanical, and
handicraftes men, and such like whom Aristotle in his politiques The people
divided into two sorts or kinds
terms to be in stead of public servants, either of these in my opinion are
both fitly and commodiously provided for, because to this meaner people, who of
nature are rather intentive to gain then to The people divided into companies
fraternities.
honor, there are also granted certain mean degrees, and dignities: for they
are divided into so many companies as there are several trades and
occupations, and every company has certain peculiar laws, under which they
are in the exercise thereof directed and governed, over every of these
companies there are chosen by suffrage of the whole company, certain, that
they may well be called as it were masters of that company: for by their
commandment many things are prescribed, and many small controversies by their
arbitrament ended, whence it comes, that all such artificers as can once
attain to that honor, do exceedingly content and please themselves therewith,
and do think themselves not smally advanced when they once are come so far,
that they are by the rest of their condition and company thought worthy of that
pre-eminence, there are besides in every Company certain other Officers
elected, though inferior to the masters thereof, yet notwithstanding of good
credit, and much respected among the rest, in some sort therefore you see that
this desire of honor, which seems to be settled even in the minds of the
lowest and meanest people, is satisfied and provided for. The other better
kind of people obtains also in the City of Venice, a better and more
honorable place, enjoying certain particular offices and decrees, of especial
reckoning and account, into which no gentleman may be admitted, though some of
them be such that as well for the commodity, The office of the Secretaries
as title of honor thereunto belonging, they might beseem any Gentleman of
Venice, the office of the Secretaries is honest, and of great regard, they sit
at the tribunals with every magistrate, the same is only given to plebeians,
and not to any gentleman, which though it be not honorable, yet it is of good
respect and estimation, for to their fidelity and carefulnes are committed all
the public books and registers, wherein all both public and private matters
are contained, of which charge and office whosoever is accounted worthy, is
both reputed to be a man honest and industrious, and much regarded in every
place, where he comes, and withal their allowance from the co^monwelth is
such, that they have not only means to mantain their families, but also to
amplify their substance, those also that are secretaries Secretaries to the
Senate.
to the Senate, are all plebeians, and not any gentleman admitted among them,
and these are more respected then the other, and therefore wont to be chosen
out of those that are of the honester sort, and ciuiller kind of people, they
have great stipends out of the common treasure, and are still acquainted with
all the proceedinges and deliberations of the Senate, for they are always
present at the counsels of the college and senate, and therefore held of all
men in high estimation, some of these are selected and chosen out to attend
upon the counsel of ten, whose decrees they register up in books, and are
privy to all such things as are handled in the college, in which honor they
remain as long as they live, not by turns, as the gentlemen do in their
offices, of which there is not any perpetual, but that of the Procurators: of
these Secretaries to the Senate one The chief Secretary to the Senate is
Cha^celor of Venice
is above the rest, and is called Chancellor of Venice, a name of great dignity
and honor, for the Procurators only excepted, there is not any Gentleman but
gives him place, he is acquainted with every secret of the common wealth, and
has great rents allowed him out of the common treasure, and when he dies, his
obsequies are honored with a funeral oration, which dignity is not in Venice
yielded to any, unless it be to the Duke or to some Citizen of extraordinary
deserte, and to none else, the Chancelour representing as it were the prince of
the common people, he only is chosen in the Sessions of the great Council,
the other Secretaries are created by the College of ten, and are subject to
their censure, if they make any fault in the public office, which they
execute, likewise are the popular assemblies and companies of artificers and
masters of every occupation, and some others of whom we will speak
hereafter, depend upon the arbitrament of the ten, and are subject to their
authority, being by the same instituted at the first, and now still ordered and
maintained, and surely the creation of this officer being at the first only to
avoid the danger of these popular meetinges and assemblies, was not done
without exceeding providence and foresight, least otherwise their fraternities
and assemblies being at the first ordained for the common good, might in time
under color of assembling, to do their duty, have tempted something
prejudicial to the common welths quietness.

There are besides these five fellowshippes and societies Five other
fellowships and societies under the names of plain sancts.
in Venice protected under the name and religion of certain saints, in which
there are innumerable numbers of men both plebeians and Patricians, of which
every one has his peculiar kind of attire, ornament, and ensign, which they
nevertheless do not use at all times but only when they go in procession, or
to honor any man's funeral, or else to any solemn service, they do usually
assemble every holyday, first hearing divine service, and then going about unto
the churches o the Saints, honoring the high and immortal God, with pompous
solemnity of supplication and prayer.

Every of these fellowships has his particular house, and in the same a goodly
and spacious hall, in which upon appointed days they do all meet to perform
the duties which they do owe unto religion, sometimes they have Mass there
solemnly celebrated, sometimes they go altogether to visit the church of some
Saints oftentimes they solemnize the obsequy and funeral of one of their
deceased brothers, offering oblations and dirges for his sins: besides those
spacious halles every of them has an appointed several room, wherein both
the heads and presidentes of these fellowships do meet, their office
continues but a year, and is among the Plebeians of especial dignity and
prerogative, their meetinges are to consult and take care for such things as
are necessary and fit for the good of the fellowshippe, and likewise there is
committed to their trust a great quantity of money, which i s to be bestowed
upon the poor: for such and so exceeding in times past, was the estimation of
these fellowshippes, that many who by testament had ordained and bequeathed the
distribution of their goods to the use of the poor, would make these to be
their executors, and wholly refer the bestowing thereof to their discretion,
insomuch that some of these fellowships in greatness of matters committed to
their charge do scarsely give place unto the Procurators of that mark, which
is one of the most honorable offices belonging to the Patrician, of which none
though he be a brother No Patrician may be head of these five fellowships.
of the fellowship, may attain to any of the precedentships thereof, that
dignity belonging only to the plebeians, wherein also they imitate the
nobility, for these heads of societies do among the people in a certain
manner represent the dignity of the procurators, but to the end that neither
their societies, nor their heads, may any way be dangerous or cumbersome to
the common wealth, they are all restrained under the power and authority of
the Council of ten, so that they may not in any thing make any alteration, nor
assemble together, unless it be at appointed seasons, without their leave and
permission, such honors do the plebeians of either sort attain unto in this
commonwealth of ours, to the end that they should not altogether think
themselves deprived of public authority, and civil offices, but should also
in some sort have their ambition satisfied, without having occasion either to
hate or perturbe the estate of nobility, by which equal temperature of
government, our common wealth has attained that, which none of the former
have, though otherwise honorable and famous, for from the first beginning till
this time of ours it has remained safe and free this thousand and two hundred
years, not only from the domination of Strangers, but also from all civil
and intestine sedition of any moment or weight, which it has not accomplished
by any violent force, armed garriso^s, or fortified towers, but only by a just
and temperate manner of ruling, insomuch that the people do obey the nobility
with a gentle and willing obedience, full of love and affection, and far from
the desire of any strange change, of which this time of ours has made evident
proof, for when all the greatest princes of Christendom had combined
themselves together with intention utterly to overthrow, deface and abolish the
greatness, glory, and the very name of the Venetians, and that our army had
been vanquished by Jews king of France, near to the City of Cassano in the
territory of Cremona, with incredible slaughter: and the Almaines of one side,
and Julius Bishop of Rome, threatening and besieging us with their armies, and
all our dominions upon the maine land, being revolted from the Venetian
government. In this our extremity and general perturbation the people of
Venice, were so far from attempting any thing against the Nobility, that
weeping, they threw themselves at their feet, offering their lives and goods
to the defense of the common wealth, and in effect reforming it, for having
easily recovered Iadoua through the great love and affection of the inhabitants
toward us, when Maximilian the Emperor, raising every where forces, came
with a mighty Army to besiege the same City, many not only of the
Gentlemen, but also of the plebeians, waging sundry soldiers at their own
charge, went unto the defense thereof, indeuoring themselves there, in such
noble and valorous sort, that the Emperor was constrained to withdraw his
Army, without delivering so much as one assault to the City, neither with
greater ado were the rest of the Cities recovered, they all flocking again
to the Venetian Empire, as to a wished haven of all security and calmness:
an excellent argument of a just domination to govern those that are desirous
and willing so to be governed, which that it falls not out so without cause,
as any man may perceive that shall mark the course of our proceedinges, for we
leave to every The equity and temperance of the Venetians government.
city that comes into the fellowship of our government, their own municipate
laws and statutes, and the Citizens, every one in their own cities, obtain
many great and honorable places, and not a few towns of those abroad in the
country, are governed by magistrates of their own, chosen among themselves,
as for those cities that are of greater fame, and in which our governors do
rule, there do always sit with them in Justice, Doctors of the law, with whom
our governors are to consult before they determine any thing, which is both a
matter of great honor and reputation, as also of great gain and commodity
unto them, these manner of offices may not be executed by any of the Nobility
of Venice, but are either chosen from among the plebeians, or else, and that in
a manner always from out the cities, subjected to our fellowship. And
therefore it may easily appear, that this our commonwealth is tempered with
that moderation, which seems chiefly and nearest to imitate nature.

For in the body of a living creature the office of looking about, and seeing
is attributed only to the eyes, and the other less noble offices, left unto
the other members that are deprived of the use of seeing, obaying and not
dissenting from that which by the eyes they are informed, but going and bending
themselves thither, whether they are by them directed, and so the whole frame
of the body is preserved and maintained in an excellent unity and agreement,
which not unlike reason is the supreme rule of things in the commonwealth of
Venice committed to the Gentlemen, as to the eyes of the city, and the
vnnobler offices to the people, both together making a happy and well compacted
body: The eyes of the commonwealth, not only seeing for themselves, but for
all the other members, and the other parts of the city, not so much regarding
themselves, as willingly obeying the direction of the eyes, as being the
principallest parts of the commonwealth, whereas whatsoever commonwealth shall
suffer it self to be carried away into that folly and madness, (as to many it
has happened) that the people will challenge unto it self the office of
seeing, and usurp the exercise of the eyes, necessarily the whole commonwealth
must tumble into a downfall and ruin: And on the other side if the gentlemen
shall only provide for their own good, neglecting that of the other members,
stirring thereby the people to envy and indignation, it were impossible that
it should go well either with the one or the other. Our ancestors therefore by
the imitation of nature have provided both for the one and the other
inconvenience, and have therein used the just temperature and excellent
moderation, that none (unless he be worse then a detractor) may any way blame
or find fault with a government so virtuously established, and so temperately
maintained: which I beseech the Almighty and everliving God long to preserve in
happiness and safety. For if it be credible that any good thing comes to
men from God: then can there nothing be more assured then that this great
felicity is happened to the City of Venice through the only blessing of his
bountiful goodness.

The end of the last book of the Commonwealth, and Magistrates of Venice.
Sundry Notes and Collections which I have gathered as well by reading and
observation, as also by conference with Venetian Gentlemen, skillful in the
state of their country, for the better understanding of sundry points, either
not at all touched in the former discourse, or else so obscurely, that the
reader being a stranger cannot thereby rest fully satisfied, especially if he
have a curious desire to know every particular of their government. But this
being added unto the former, I doubt not but the state of the whole shall be so
clearly and exactly delivered unto him, as though (if it were possible) he
should see the same in a glass.

the Adriatique sea, directly over against that place where the river Brenta,
that runs along the territory of Padoua, not long since entered into those
lakes: for the better knowledge of the nature and manner of which lakes, you
must understand that the Province of Marca Treuizana, which the ancients called
Venetia (whence this happy and famous City deriueth her beginning) lies so
low along the shore of the Adriatique sea, that what through the waters of many
rivers that fall from the maine land, as also the ouerflowinges of the sea,
which enter in through the gappes and breaches of that huge and mighty bank,
which they call Lito Maggior, a great space thereof within the said bank
remains Lito Maggior
fennish and in water: which space resembles a bended bow, the hollownesse of
the land compassing and embracing the same being the bow, and the string being
this great bank I speak of, serving as a bulwark or rampire against the
violence of the sea: reaching from the point of the said sea, otherwise called
Sinus Adriaticus, and so extending it self (in a manner) still The bank

in a direct and straight line, till it come to join with the shore of the
main land under Brondolo. This bank has here and there certain gappes, at
which the sea at full tides enters in, and at low and ebbing water goes out
again, and through them likewise do those rivers that run into the lakes
pass into the sea.

Those openings are also called Ports or Havens, because they give entry and
passage to such ships, as come and go from all parts of the world. The
principallest of them are those of Brondolo, of Chioggia, of Malomocco, of
Castella, of S. Erasmo, Lito Maggior, and the Treports. All that space then,
which is between the said bank and the firm land, is the same which we call
the lakes of the Adriatique sea, which yet are not so wholly drowned in water,
but that there are therein many uncovered and dry places, which are those
Islands in which the bordering people saved themselves from the tempestuous and
barbarous fury of the Goths and Vandales: and being there assembled together,
did lay the foundation of this noble City: which where it is nearest, is five
miles off from the maine land, and two from the bank: it was in times past
ten miles off from the maine land, the lakes then stretching to that place
upon the Burnt, which (as many think) was then for that cause called Ora
Lacus.

go from Venice to Padoua, are lifted over the bank or ssuce that keeps the

breadth, as Arnus does through Florence and Pisa, Tiber through Rome, and the
Adice through Verona. They say that this channel was first made by the Burnt,
when it entered into the sea by the breach in the bank, called Porto di
Castella, before such Many other channels enter into the great channells

other cities are with streets) have recourse into the same: for the most part
of these you must go by boat, unless it be some that have a little pathe on

some on both sides, but they are few.

There are also in Venice many land streets, which they call Calli, but they
are nothing fair: for besides that they are neither long nor straight, they
are so very narrow, that two men can scarce go together in one of them side by
side.

Bridges over the lesser channels.
Over the channels there are made many little bridges of stone, that do join
one street to another, yet not so thick, but that sometimes when you would go
from one place to another, which is but hard at hand, you must fetch a great
circuit about.

Upon the great channel there is but one only bridge, and the same of wood,
standing in the most frequented part of the city: for it joins the Bialto,
which is the place where the marchantes meet, with the street that leads to
the high Church, where the Dukes Palace stands. But because every one that
would pass the channel, shall not need to come to this bridge so far
Diverse ordinary passages or ferries over the great channel.
about out of his way, there are in diverse places certain ordinary ferry boats,
upon which pooremen do attend to set over such as shall require them: they are
appointed what number of persons they shall ferry over at once, and withal
what they shall take of every passenger. Likewise all the other lesser
channelles are full of little boats, which they call Gondolas, to pass up and
down along the City, which the Venetians do use in steed of horses, Mules
and coaches. The gentlemen have many serving to their own use, and many
besides, wherewith their servants gain them money: so that the number of those
boats is exceeding great. The beauty of the city is much better perceived by
water then by land, for the channels be universally large, and all the fairest
buildinges of the city are seated upon them, The fairest show of the city
answers upon the water.
which though the answer also upon the streets (for every one has two
entries, one by water, another by land) yet the fairest show is commonly still
to the water. There are also sundry very fair houses, whose principal front
is to the street, but the narrowness of the streets hinders and eclipseth
the magnificence of their sight.

Much garbage and filthiness falls from the city into the channels, which
is carried away by the flowing and ebbing of the water, and yet that alone
would not serve the turn, but that they are also continually cleansed and
taken away.

The air of Venice very healthy.
In times passed (as Victruuius writes) the air of Venice, by reason of the
lakes was thought to be unwholesome, but now they hold that the air of Venice
and Padoua is purer and more healthy then in any other part of Italy, in so
much that there is not in any place to be found more lustly old men, well
colored and of good complexions.

Donatus distinguishes the inhabitants of Venice into Three sorts and degrees

three parts, viz. Plebeyans, citizens and Gentlemen. The Plebeians he terms
to be those that exercise base arts utterly incapable of office or degree in
the commonwealth: the citizens to be marchantes and men of a degree above the
other, capable of certain popular offices: and the gentlemen to be those of
the great council, Lords of the state, etc. as above.

But this distinction is particular unto himself, contrary to Sabellicus,
Contarene, and the rest, who only divide them into two, Plebeians, and
Patritians, viz. the common people, and the gentlemen.

Their number of fighting men.
There are reckoned to be twenty thousand houses in the City, so that
according to their computation allowing out of every family two, they are able
to arm forty thousand fighting men, and in former times have done so.

The gentlemen of the state abroad and at home are thought to be 3000. They are
absolutely Lords of the city and whole estate both by sea and land.

The children and brethren of the Duke living, and of the Dukes that are
deceased, are always held in very great honor and much respected.

The balls which they do use in the great council are either of Copper or Tin,
of which some are guilted, and some siluered. Whosoever is chosen Elector for
any office, may if he shall so think good, name himself in the same, and so
stand to the comprobation of the suffrages, as in the former treatise is
mentioned.

When any weighty matter is to be handled in the great council, as the
establishment of a new law, or the definitive determination of any great
judgment, there must of necessity be 600. gentlemen in the hall, and four
Counselors, or else the same may not pass.

Signori delle Pomp.
There are certain magistrates, of whom the former treatise makes no mention,
called Signiori delle pomp, who are diligently to look into the reformation
of apparel, and moderation of excess generally in all other expenses, and
finally to see all such laws strictly observed as are in those behalfes
provided. Censors.


There are likewise of late instituted and created with great authority two
Censors, whose office is chiefly to repress the ambition of the gentlemen, and
to look with severity into their faultiness. There was a law lately
propounded by them in the great council, and by the same with great allowance
ratified and enacted, that thence forward there should be no congratulation
used at breaking up of the Council, with those that had obtained offices and
honors: which still remains in vigor and force, for before time every man at
the opening of the Council, would press to take them by the hand, that were
elected for Magistrates, protesting with many vows, that they were glad in
their hearts, of the honor and advancement befallen them, yea even those would
say so that had given their suffiages against them, which was by the Censors
judged to be a great abuse, and unworthy of the Venetian nobility, being in
all other things so grave and honorable.

Upon the death of the Duke, the six high counselors do presently enter into
the palace: the eldest counselor supplying the place of the deceased Duke,
and dispatching sundry things that do appertain unto the royal office. All
letters that in the mean time the state sends forth, are entitled under the
name of the governors, and all such as are sent unto them, are so directed and
superscribed. They never stir out of the Palace till the creation of the new
Duke. The great gates also of the Palace are closed, and only a wicket left
open for people to go in and out, keeping there also a guarde of men, the same
rather for a solemnity and ancient custom, then any needful occasion. For
there is in the City of Venice no greater alteration at the death of their
Duke, then at the death of any other private Gentleman, only the magistrates
do not in the mean while assemble about the dispatch of affairs till the
creation of the new Duke, having no leisure by reason of their business
thereabout to attend to any thing else.

The Dukes funeral.
The body of the dead Duke being adorned with royal garments is brought into a
lower hal, which they call Sala de Pioueghi, where it is kept three days
together, and there are twenty Gentlemen all attyred in skarlet, appointed to
accompany the corpse into the said hall, and to sit round about it, which
likewise they do the following days, at the end whereof his funeral is
solemnised with all requisite pomp and magnificence.

After the burial of the Duke the great Council is presently assembled, and
in their first sitting there are chosen five Correctors, and three Inquisitors,

then only by the purse, they amerced the heirs of Loredanus one of their late
Dukes, in 1500. Crowns, only because he had not vphelde his dignity, with
such majesty and magnificence, as he should have done, and yet otherwise all
they acknowledge him to have been a very wise, and well deserving prince.

The office of the Correctors is to see whether it be necessary to make any
new law, or to correct or amend any abuse crept in under the government of the
other Prince.

When the Duke goes abroad, all the belles of S. Mark are rung, and there go
before him sounding many trnmpets of very extraordinary greatness, and there
are likewise borne before him certain streamers and banners, then a cushin, and
a chair of gold, and music next follows the person of the Duke under a
Cannopie in the midst of two of the chief Ambassadors, the rest following him
behind, then follow next after them thirty couples of Gentlemen, wearing all

the right hand of the first couple, carries a sword upright in his hand.

Every wednesday the Duke uses to come down from his Tribunal, and to go to
the courts where the other Judges and Magistrates do administer Justice, and to
look into their proceedinges, exhorting and admonishing them to do that which
equity and right requires, and if any suitor do think there that his case is
not justly dealt withal, he may with all hu^blenes recommend the same unto the
Duke, which if the Duke finds to be so indeed, he presently commands the
magistrate to do him reason: but if contrary, he then reprehendeth him that
made the complaint, and so proceeds on forward: some of the late Dukes have
changed this order, and do not keep any one certain day in this visitation of
Courts, to the end that they might chance in upon the magistrates on a
sudden, and take them at unawares.

The counsel of ten is a mighty member of the Venetian commonweealth,
having in some sort a kind of likeness, in authority to the Roman Dictator,
that was created in times of danger: for in matters of great importance deeply
touching the estate of the commo^wealth, that require either secrecy or speed
of dispatch, either of the which should be hindered, if they should communicate
the same to the great counsel, or to the Senate, they may of themselves
determine and end it, as to denounce a war, to conclude a peace, to send a
proueditor into the army, or to manage vnderhande a secret practice, of either
of which they have many presidents of happy success to the state always in
these speedy deliberations, there assemble with them, the Duke and six
Councellers, which assembly is simply and absolutely called the Council of the
ten, the Council of ten have certain Galleys in the Arsenall particularly

belonging to their commandment and charge, signed with these two letters c.
and x. for Capi de dieci. The power and authority of this College of ten is
so great, and by reason thereof so subject to envy of the rest, that sundry
times when their terms were expired, there was much a do to consent to the
creation of these successors, for remedy of which inconnenience, there was such
means wrought, that there was a law made, that the old Council of ten should
keep themselves still in authority, till such time as those new that should
succeed in their places, were created and established, and fully confirmed.

The office of Procurators, though it be not any of those, wherein the virtue
and force of the common wealths government consists, yet it is one of the
greatest, most desired, and best respected dignities of Venice, continuing,
during the life of those that are once elected even like to that of the Duke,
it is also one of the auncientest offices, still from time to time maintaining
it self in honor and reputation, even unto this present age, so that there
was never in Venice any gentleman of any principal reckoning, but that did
think himself greatly honored with this dignity, and since the first
institution thereof, few have been chosen Dukes, that had not first been
Procurators.

Anciently there was only one procurator appointed to have care of the Temple
of Saint Mark, and of the holy Ornaments, and Treasures thereunto belonging.

But afterward upon the death of the D. Sebastian Ciam, who left a great and
mighty beqeuest to S. Mark, and withal, the oversight and charge of al his
rents and reuenews to the procurator, the greatness whereof exceeding the
sufficiency of any one magistrate thoroughly to take care of, and withal not
to neglect his other charges belonging to the Temple; there was an other
Procurator created to take charge alone of this Legacy, and bequest of
Sebastian Ciam, whose honest fidelity corresponding to the trust reposed in
him, encouraged many at their deaths, to leave the administration of their
goods unto him insomuch that he growing unable to bear the burden of so many
affairs, there was a third procurator chosen in the year 1270. Rimeri zen o
Belling then Duke, and the business so divided between them, that one should
look to the Temple, and the Treasures thereof, another to those Legacies that
were made on this side of the great Channel, and the third to those that
were made on the further side thereof: in this Dukes time was also the fourth
created and appointed to assist him that had the charge of the Temple of S.
Mark, and the treasures thereof in equal authority, two more were made in the
time of D. Giouani Soueranzo, and three more in the year 1423. Francisco
Foscaro being Duke, so that they were in all nine, three for the Temple of S.
Mark, and the church Treasures, three for the oversight of Legacies, made on
this side of the great channel, and three for those on the further side, the
year 1509. when their Army was overthrown at Adda, by Jews the 12. king of
France, the commonwealth being in distress, they were contented for a sum
of money to impart this dignity to six more, and since have been so many
made, that they come in all to be four and twenty, all the rest that are added
to the first nine, have several procuration appointed them, as you may read
in the former Treatise, they have likewise authority to constrain the heirs
to perform the Will of the testators: they wear such fashioned garments as
the Duke does, and are followed with many servants, in procession the six
Councellers do go before them and the three heads of the Forty, for as they
go along the Councellers and the said heads are upon the right hand, and the
Procurators upon the left, they have every one a dwelling place, or else forty
Ducates a year allowed them.

They all are admitted into the Senate, but not into the Council of ten,
save only nine of the eldest and best respected, they cannot obtain any other
office, unless it be of the chief sages, or else the Giunta to the council
of ten, and when there is a captain general of the army, or a proueditor of
the camp to be chosen, there is a law made in the Senate, that whosoever is a
procurator, may obtain that dignity, which is so ordained, to the end that
such great and weighty charges should be executed by men of great estimation
and honor, they may not come into the great counsel, but only by the election
of the Duke, which is lately granted by a special decree, they were wont to
stand in the Court without the great Council, when the same was assembled, and
there to stay during the continuance of the Council, within the palace, to
the end that if any disorder should happen, they might be at hand to amend it,
and this in likelihoode was the occasion, that they were first forbidden to
enter into the Council: but not this custom of assembling themselves, and
staying in the court, while the council sits, is no longer observed, which
proceeds through the quiet and general securenesse of the city: insomuch
that they think it altogether needless for the Procurators to be morein one
place then in another.

These three councels of the Forty are exceedingly well discoursed of in the
former treatise, nevertheless for the full and clear understanding of their
several offices and dignities, I thought good to set here down some
particularities by him omitted, the recital of which, though perchance in his
opinion he deemed needelesse, yet I judge them not unnecessary to those that
do desire to have a perfect knowledge of the Venetian government.

The first of these three councels of forty are as you have heard, the new, for
civil matters abroad, the second for civil matters within, and the third is
called the crim inall council, which is not only above all causes criminal
both at home and abroad, that are brought unto it by virtue of appeal, but
also does of it self determine many entire causes, that are not touched of any
other magistrare, the forty are chosen in the great council, and must all
pass the age of 30. years, the other offices any gentleman may attain at the
age of 25. years: the election is not made all in one day, but in eight
several days, and sitting in every of which they choose five upon the choice
of these new forty, they are straight admitted into the new civil council,
and do enter thence into the old civil council, and they of the old civil
presently into the criminal, as you heard before, so that passing 8. months,
in either their whole time of authority is 2. years, there are over every of
these, 43. heads, and two under heads, which authority they hold only two
month s a piece, the heads of the last forty which are the criminal Judges,
are they that do ioyn with the Duke and counselors, and with the^ do represent
the person of the Venetian government. These heads and vnderheads are all
elected by lot.

There are also in the great Council, three manner of Magistrates created,
that do bring in and propound causes, every one to the forty appointed him, the
first are the three Aduocators of the common which do bring in the causes to
the Criminal forty.

The second are the three old Auditors that do bring in the home civil
causes, to the old civil Forty.

The third are the three new Auditors that do bring all foreign civil causes,
into the new civil Forty.

The Aduocators of the common, is a dignity of great account, and never
granted but to men of great years, wisdom, and experience, his chiefest
charge is to see the law strictly observed, and therefore in judgment he is
always against the offender.

There are also many that are Aduocators, whose office is to plead in causes,
either of accusing or defendiug, accordingly, as they are either by the
plaintiff or defendant, entertained: it is not of necessity requisite that they
be Doctors of law, or that they have therein much studied, only that they be
skillful in the statutes, and ordenances of the commonwealth, they must all be
gentlemen, for there is an ancient law, that none may plead before the
magistrate, unless he be a gentleman: and therefore there are in the great
Council chosen 24. Aduocators, 20. for the offices of the palace, and 4. for
the Ryalto: of which every one that goes to law, is bound to entertayn one,
and to pay him a certain fee, and he likewise is bound to defend his cause, who
entertaineth him, the place where they plead, is somewhat high, and they have
at their feet the notary of the 40 with such writings as they mean to produce,
and diverse times amid their pleading they command him to read now one
Chapter, now one writing, and then another, as the cause requires. The time
that either party is allowed for speech is an hour and a half, besides the
time that is spent in reading the writings: in so much that when the Advocate
speaks, there is an hour glass held upright, and when the writings are
read, the same is turned upon one side, to the end the sand should not fall
through, and then is turned upright again when he begins to speak. When
either part has alleged his reasons, and that sentence is to be given the
youngest of the forty causes every of the Judges to swear that he will give
that sentence, which in his conscience he shall think to be just, and then
they go to their suffrages, in manner as you may see in the former treatise.

All causes that are brought unto the Aduocators are registered up by their
secretary, one first, the other next, and so forth, in order as they come, and
look in what order they are registered, in the same are they by them brought
in, and propounded to the forty, except it be some, which though they come
last, yet they are still first dispatched, as the case of prisoners, of
burialles, of medicines, of corn, of rewards, of Orphlins, of near kindred,
as if the brother should plead with his brother, or the father with his son:
these causes are always first heard, and likewise all such as any way pertain
to the office or administration of the Procurators.

The dominion of the Venetians is divided into two parts, the one by sea, the
other by land, out of either of which they receive a great yearly in-come. Of
the two they account the firm land reuenewe to be the greater, especially
their possessions in Lombardie are marvelous rich and auayleable unto them:
where besides many other towns, castles, and villages, they possess seven
fair cities, as Treuigi, Padoua, Vicenza, Verona, Brescia, Bergamo, and Crema.
By sea they are Lords of Cypres, Candia, Corfu, and many other Islandes. Upon
the coasts also of Sclauonia, Dalmatia and Histria, they possess many goodly
Cities and castelles. Besides these the rents of their own city, their
customs and tolles by sea, and their ordinary yearly taxation or rather (as
they call it) tribute of the inhabitants, amounts to an excessive sum: in
so much that their reuenews one way or other is known to beat the least
1200000. Ducats by the year: their charges and yearly occasions of
disburstment are likewise very great, for always they do entertain in
honorable sort, with great provision a Captain general, who always is a
stranger borne: he that now enjoys that place is one John Baptista de Monte a
Florentine borne, a notable soldier, and a very honorable Gentleman, one under
whom I have served in the wars, and am in all thankfulness to acknowledge
many favors that I received both from him and his brother Camillo de Monte.
Besides they do continually entertayne in pay a thousand men at arms, and a
great number of footmen, sufficient to keep and defend those places, in the
which they keep garrisons always, as well in times of war, as of peace: they
give likewise great pensions to many gentlemen and Captains, whose service
they use when need requires. The most part of their land forces they
maintain in Lombardie, where by reason of the abundance of victuailes they
may live commodiously, and when time of war so requires, they send them
thence whither they shall think good. They also keep continually ten or
twelve armed Galleys of war, which are distributed in Cypres, Candia, and
Corfu, and other commodious places. In every Galley they have 150. rowers: for
there are 50. benches, and upon every bench three rowers, besides every one
contains between 80. and 100. soldiers to fight. The charges of every Galley
one way or other amount to 700. duckettes a month, likewise their provisions of
war and the charges of and concerning their Arsenall are of an infinite and
excessive expense.

They have always armor in the Arsenall to arm ten thousand men, and in the
armory of the Dukes palace to arm 1500. against whatsoever sudden
inconvenience might happen, besides an innumerable quantity of munition
pertaining to the sea, and artillery of all sort in marvelous proportion. In
times of war and necessity they do sometimes propose great offices and
dignities to sale for a certain sum of money: for which when sundry offer
the sum proposed, yet none is elected unless he overcome his competitors and
riuals by suffrage, so that commonly not withstanding the sale thereof, yet the
same never falls upon any but upon the wisest and most sufficient men.

Collections taken out of the history of Signior Bernardo Giustiniano, a
Gentleman of Venice.
TOuching the original of the name of the Venetians, there are sundry opinions.
Some write that they come of a certain people of Asia, called Eneti, who after
the destruction of Troy, having lost Philemene their king, came with their
navy under the conduct of Antenor, into those lakes of the Adriatique sea,
giving the name of Veneti unto that part of Italy where they settled, which
opinion is by Liuie maintained. Pliny, Cato, and Cornelius Nepos, derive the
Venetians absolutely from the of spring of the Troianes.

Seruius Grammaticus will needs have their nomination to come from Enetus king
of the Sclauonians. But once, howsoever they differ in their true original:
they all agree that they are of great antiquity, and famous even in their
first beginnings. The Cantons of Venice did before the inhabitation of the
lakes, under that name embrace a great circuit upon the main land, as all
Marca Treuigiana, and the greater part of Foro Iulio: but now only the Isles,
and inhabited places within the lakes do retain and peculiarly challenge to
themselves the name of Venice.

The situation thereof is so strange and singular in it self, that it brooketh
no comparison or resemblance with any other City, either of this present or
former ages: the manner whereof is this. There is a long bank that encompasseth
the utmost Gulf of the Adriatique sea: within the inner part whereof are
certain great marshes or fennes, occasioned partly by the descent of the
rivers from the maineland, partly by the flowing of the sea: within these were
sundry little towns, built by those that endeavored to defend themselves from
the fury of the land wars, and lastly Venice.

Nature the mistress and best working perfectresse of things, defends them
from the violence of the sea, by the opposition of this bank, increased with
huge heaps of sand: and yet not altogether without the artifice and travail
of man, by fortifying against the sea in places needful, with strong palisadoes
and mighty peers or bulwarks of stone. These lakes were in times passed upon
their brinkes to the maine land encompassed and adorned with many great and
renowned cities, as Aquileia on the east side thereof, sometimes a famous
Colonie of the Romans: next unto it Concordia, then Vderzo, then Altinos,
likewise Triuigi and Padoua, then the Moncellese, which some will needs have
to be that which was called Acello, then upon the bounding and shutting up of
the utmost point Adria and Rauenna, which was in those days also environed
about with marshes and fennes, and cleansed by certain ditches, that (as
Strabo writes) were made for the same purpose: but whereas in the beginninges
of Augustus Caesar the buildings thereof were all of wood.

Afterward Augustus and his successors Tiberius, Traiane, Valentian, and
Theodoricke, enobled it with goodly edifices, of marble and free stone, each of
them doing somewhat, as well in erection of many sumptuous private palaces, as
public magnificent Temples, for the Gods. And withal they filled and choked
up those marshes, in sort that they reduced them to firm ground, so that
whereas before it was of all sides environed about with those waters, it is now
distant three miles from them.

Besides sundry of less reckoning, there do disgorge down into these Lakes,
seven famous rivers that come descending from the Alps: as Taliagmento,
Liuenza, La Piaue, La Brenta, Bachiglione, Adice and Poe: which two last
rivers, the Adice and the Poe have filled and stuffed up those parts of the
Lakes, into which they fall with sand, and the like have sundry of the other
rivers done in many places: but where the industry and travail of men has
defended and prevented the inconvenience thereof. For those marshes and Lakes,
whose length in times passed little less extended then two hundred miles, are
now reduced to the half thereof. Their breadth where they are now at largest,
not being above twelve mile, whereas in the time of our ancestors it was twice
as much, which being a thing that the enemies of the Venetian State could never
accomplish, though with great endeavor many times they attempted to choke and
dry up those Lakes, time has by little and little, by the descent of those
land rivers effected it without any foreign violence, in dispight of all the
defenses opposed by the Venetians. The great encompassing bank has in manner
as many ruptures and passages as are the great rivers that descend into the
lakes: at which the tides of the sea go in and out, ebbing and flowing every
six hours by turn.

The flood never arises higher then four feet within the Gulf, unless
sometime when the wind Seirocco blows with an extraordinary violence, and
then sometimes it arises to the height of seven feet.

Sebastian Munsters description of the City of Venice.
VEnice was first the name of a Province, and not of a City. There be many
other Towns in Italy of greater antiquity.

About the year of our Lord 300. there came out of Scithia a barbarous
people, called Hunnes, ouerrunning sundry nations of Europe, with exceeding
terror and cruelty, their first vagabonding race was into Thracia, and thence
they passed through Mesia and Illiria into Italy. The Venetians that then
inhabited a Province upon the firm land, on the Adriatique shore, hearing of
their arriual, fled into the sea, seating themselves there in little Islands,
of which there were many at hand, living for the most part there by fishing.
The Rialto why to called.
At length they began to build upon these Islands, chiefly upon that which is
called Riuo alto, to called, because the water is more deep then there about
the other Islandes, or else because that Island is more eminent then the rest:
in short space the deuastation and cruelty wrought by Attyla upon the
neighboring land towns, as Aquileia, Concordia, Alcina, Padoua, Optergia,
Heraclia, Aquilius, Grado, Capreola, and Lauretta, did (as it were) by a
revolution give a speedy beginning to the rising greatness of Venice. The
first founders thereof were those of Padoua: in short time it increased in
opulence and riches, and grew mighty both by sea and land, conquering many
Realms, Cities and Islands, of which the Turk in our time has taken some from
them.

He means that she is co^mandresse of the Adtiatique seas.
In fine this noble, goodly and magnificent city is become Queen of the sea,
and inhabited by people of sundry nations, and traffiqued to by merchants from
out all parts of the world. There a man may hear all languages, and see all
diversity of garments: it is said that the only Tribute which the state

958. they put the fifteenth into a cloister, they banished the 28. and stoned
to death the 45. called Rinaldo, they imprisoned the 46. and beheaded the 55.

These and other things are written of the Venetians and their Dukes, but
Gasper Contareno that has written expressly of the commonwealth of Venice,
being himself a Senator of the City, touches not at all the miserable end of
these Dukes, his attire is no whit different from that which kings do use, for
his garments are all of purple or rich cloth of gold: he wears on his
head a royal diadem made of linen, which is environed with a hoode of
purple, about which there goes a little crown of gold, when he enters
into the Senate, he has his throne gorgeously adorned, and the Senators speak
unto him with their heads bare standing up as before a Prince, all letters
sent and received are directed and signed to and by the Duke. The laws are
published in his name, and their coin stamped with his name and image, in fine
the Duke in all things representes the person of a king before his subjects,
save that he has not the bridle of full authority in his own hands, to make
him appear with the greater magnificence and pomp, they allow him out of the
common treasure 1500. Crowns, which he may not turn to his particular use, but
on such things as pertain to the greatness and train of a prince, otherwise
his heirs should be sure to pay the amends of so great dishonor after his
death, he must of his own charge maintain a great troop of servants to
follow him, when he goes abroad, and to make every year four Bankets to
the Senators and Gentlemen.

Upon Ascension day, according to the custom of his Predicessors, he goes
aborde a fine ship curiously trimmed, and set sorth, and in company of the
Bishop, The ship is called the Bi^entorie.
and other Senators, launcheth out into the Sea, throwing a ring into the same,
with express words, that he marries the Sea in perpetual Dominion, and
rule. The Bishop also uses certain ceremonies, which being ended they depart,
the election of the Duke is in such sort by lot, that no man's ambition,
brybery, or subornation may stand him any way in stead, presently upon his
choice, he is borne by the mariners with great pomp to the place of S. Mark,
throwing all the while, money about in the streets, till such time as he come
to the place where the Diadem is put on his head.

Touching their rents, riches, common treasure, revenues, tributes, exactions
and customs, that they levy out of the Cities, that are under them, it is not
easy to give a just reckoning, but it is written, that they do sometimes
charge their subjects with very heavy tributes: Charlemaine granted great
privilege to the Venetians, for which notwithstanding they were unthankful,
and secretly sent aid to Nicephorus Emperor of Constantinople, that was his
enemy, whereat Charlemain being agrieued, sent his son Pepin, whom he had
made king of Italy to be revenged, so that Pepin leuying a great Army, chased
them to the Rialto, where he intended to assault them, and to that end made a
great long bridge, but by reason of tempestuous weather, his bridge brake, and
his enterprise failed.

In the year of our Lord, 810. certain marchantes brought the body of S.
Mark from Alexandria to Venice, The body of S. Mark when brought unto Venice.

now there to be seen.

also under Otto the 3. Emperor of that name they adjoined to their dominion
many other Islands and cities, principally Parence, Pole, Arbu, Coricte,
Corcyre, now called Corphu, Pharo also now called Lesima, and many other
cities where Pirates had their receipt. Some few years after; the Turk began
to make wars upon them, and taking from them the fair cities of Tirachum in
Albany, and Croy in Slcauonia, did so abase them, and bring them to such a
diffidence of their strength, that to obtain his friendship they were feign to
give him 13. fair cities, which they had conquered, and won from the
Emperor of Greece, besides Cosdre a most goodly city of Albany, in the year
1400. they got Vincensa that appertaitained to the Vicount of Mylan, in the
year 1472. they got Padoua, and Verona, from the Roman Empire, in the year
1402. they possessed themselves of the realm of Cipres, some say by a
detestable and unchristian practice, which was in order, as follows.

The heirs males of right and lawful line, failing The history of the unjust
practice used by the Vene tians in their possession of Cipies.
in Cipres, Lews D. of Sauoy, having married Charlot, the lawful daughter to
king Ihon, was called and received of all with great joy, as their king, Jacques
bastard, brother to the said Charlot, finding himself too weak to resist the
said Duke of Sauoy, fled with his friends into Alexandria, to demand aid of
the Souldan, Jacques was a young Gentleman of two and twenty years of age, of
a comely stature and very beautifullpersonage, the Souldan was moved with his
presence and prayers, and promising him succor, did presently apparel him
with royal ornaments, proclaming him his tributarie king of Cipres, and
withal commanded the Duke of Sauoy to get him home into his own country:
who sent him back a very submisse embassage, with favor and humble words,
offering him his perpetual love and service, and a yearesy tribute, and
withal a yearly pension of ten thousand crowns to Jacques during his life,
the matter was long debated of in the Council of the Souldan, who was sundry
times inclining to the acceptance ofthese offers, but in the end such were
the perfwasions and instant means used by Jacques to the contrary, especially
having by solicitation gained the Venetians and Mahomet Emperor of the Turks
to favor his party, that the Souldan granting fully to his request, took his
oath, and sent him into Cipres with a great army of men, when at his first
ariuall; he constrained Jews with such Frenchmen, as were with him to retire
himself into a Castle, which also in time he made him to abandon, and so
became Lord of the whole Island, shortly after he married the daughter of a
Gentleman of Venice, called Marcus Cornarius, which daughter was after the
death of Jacques, adopted by the Senate, and by this means they possessed
themselves of the Realm, for she being great with child at the death of her
husband, the Venetians as tutors retired her unto them, and took adminstration
of the Realm, some will say that they poisoned the child afterward, as
likewise they had done the father before, others write otherwise, that they did
not get the realm by so great wickedness, but that after the death of the
father and the son, they succeeded in the Realm, by way of adoption and
inheritance.

called Crystal glasses, which are thence transported into all countries.

Notes out of Girolamo Bardi.
THe first that ever inhabited upon that Island called the Rialto, where Venice
now stands, was one Giouani Bono a poor man, that having there a simple
cottage did live with his family by taking of fish: afterward Radagasso with
an army of Goths, entering into Italy, sundry from of the firm land fled
into this poor man's house for safety of their lives, and among the rest one
Entinopus a carpenter of Candia, who found means to build himself there a
house, maintaining himself afterward by the making of small barks and
boats: After Radagasso Alaricus coming like a tempest into Italy, there fled
so many over thither, as that at length there were built four and twenty
several houses of bordes and reeds: but in the year of our Lord, 418. the
fury of the wars being somewhat mitigated, the most part of these fugitives
had gotten themselves into Padoua, whereof a sudden hearing great and
fearful rumors of new intended entries into Italy by Aiulfo king of the
Vissigots, with a mighty multitude of Barbarians, by a general consent they
agreede to make some firm place within these lakes, and thereupon to build a
city, which they presently effected upon the foresaid Island, gathering into
the same the people that were dispersed about the other Islands, and withal
making it of the best defense they could, they called it by the name of Venice,
the beginning of this Cities foundation was laid in the year 421. upon the
25. day of March about noon, there were three Consuls chosen by those of Padoua
to have the oversight and charge, the rest whose names were Alberto Faletro,
Tomaso Candiano, and Zeno Daulo: this is a breuiat drawn out of the ancient
Records of Padoua.

Afterward the ruin and desolation of many fair cities upon the maine
land, gave a speedy mightiness and increase to this new erected city,
insomuch that many of the noblest land inhabitants, fled thither with their
treasures and richest moueables, transporting even their goodly pillars, carved
stones, and other matter to build withal, to Venice, erecting thereunto
themselves new and stately mansions, so that in the end delighted with the
security of the place, having their children borne and brought up there, they
resolved there perpetually to remain: there are in Venice 72. (as they call
them) Parochiae, that are equal in manner unto Bishoprics, over which are
elected grave and reverent pastors chosen out of that quarter and particion of
the city, wherein their churches stand: these churches have great and goodly
rents belonging unto them, and are exceedingly adorned with Organs, images,
instruments and all other magnificent ornaments.

The Arsenall is in compass without the walls 3. miles about, and resembles in
it self a little world having within it such variety ofseuerall handicrafts
and trades that it is in manner impossible for any to comprehend them in his
mind that has not seen them with his eyes, insomuch that the marquess of
Guasto who was general The Marquis of Guasto his speech touching the Arsenal
under the Emperor Charles the 5. in Italy, having gone up and down in it from
morning to night, at his coming forth swear that he had rather be Lord of the
Arsenall then of 4* of the best cities of Italy, all manner of arms, weapons,
artillery, sails, powder, anchors, tacklinges, and whatsoever else to be
imagined pertaining to the war, and the Galleis themselves are not only kept
and preserved within the Arsenall, but also wrought and framed, there do daily
work within it 1580. men, who have all wages according to their decrees, who
when they are so old that they can work no longer, are there also entertained
so long as they live.

The prince being dead, his bowels are taken out, and his body embawmed, after
which he is kept three days openly, in the hall, attended on with Senators,
as you heard before, his hearse being covered over with cloth of gold, and his
sword and his spurs of gold lying athwart upon him, then in carrying him to
his buryall, the fraternities of the town are assembled, and the several
companies of the chanons and clergy with an innumerable number of torches,
many of which are carried by the Jesuits, in middle of which follows the
beer, whereon the body of the prince reposeth in such sort as you heard, next
after follows the officers and chief servants of the princes family, all
apparrelled in black with great hoodes over their heads, and drawing a long
train after them, representing a marvelous show of mourning and sorrow, then
next after follow the Senators, all in skarlet and grain, signifying the city
to be free, and therefore ought not to mourn at the death of any prince how
virtuous soever

With this pomp they pass on to the place of S. Mark, where joining with the
beer to the great door of the church, they lift it up nine times, as in taking
perpetual leave thereof, and thence go unto the church of S. Giouani, Paulo,
(where for the most part the Dukes lie buried, and there reposing the body
upon a high place of estate, brightned with a number of flaming torches round
about, the Signeurie sits down, and there in the pulpit is made a solemn
funeral oration, in commendation and honor of the dead prince. The funenerall
being ended, the Senators return to the palace, and presently proceed to the
choice of a new Duke.

There are certain officers, of which Contareno speaks nothing at all, or
else very sparingly, and some that have been instituted since his time, of all
which I think it not necessary briefly to say somewhat, for the better
satisfaction of the reader: and first of those whom they call Cathaueri.

These are Judges of the confiscations, and exactors of the public duties,
they were created in the year 1280. They succeed in the goods of those that
die intestate, if they have no lawful heirs. They gather in those penalties
as are by the other Judges inflicted upon offenders.

They are Judges over the officers of shipping. They make public sales in name
of the commune: they are Judges of such things as are found at sea, or
treasures that are found at land. They hear such differences as do arise
between pilgrims that go to the holy land, and the matters of the ships wherein
they go, and the names of the pilgrims are registered in their office, and they
are newly put in authority about the determination of such causes as concern
the inhabitants of Cipres.

Sopra Castaldi.
There are other called Sopracastaldi, whose office is to serve executions upon
judgment, so that they are called Judges of executions. They have the selling
of such goods as are attached by executions, and have the hearing of all such
differences as do arise about such attachments, executions, contradictions,
etc. They are every morning at S. Marks: they have also place in the Rialto.
They were instituted in the year 1471.

Because there might error be committed in the execution of judgments, it was
ordained that the prince should hear the appeals from the executions of the
former officer: but because his person was to be busied about greater affairs,
there were certain Superiors ordained that might censure the doings of the
Sopracastaldi. And because they might also sometimes err in their
deliberations, it was likewise ordained, that from them also might the party
agreeued appeal to the Aduocators. They were created in the year 1485.

Signeore all aque.
There are certain officers over the water, called Signore all aque. They have
charge of such things as appertain to the Lakes, and to the cleansing of the
channels: Sig* alla Sanita Mountbanks are certain that show their drugs in the
market places, vaunting of great cures they have done, and with long tales
persuading the people to buy their ware.
and those boats that are upon the great channel are under their authority.
Besides those other things mentioned in the former treatise that belongs to
the office of the healthmaisters: they have authority to give license to
phisicions to practice, and to Mountebanks, and Chiarlatanes to go up and down
the country, and to preach in the markets: to them also is brought the
register, containing the number of all public women within the town: Finally,
so great is their authority, that in time of sickness they have power to punish
with death.

Doana de Mare, are officers of the custom, who are to look to such
merchandise as is brought in by the common galleys and ships, and not to suffer
any things to pass, till all duties and custom be discharged.

Signori della Pace.
There are also five peacemaysters, who are to judge between them that give one
another blows or wounds, or do offer any other kind of wrong, or do use any
villainy in speech, their office is to appease strife, and to make atonement
and friendship, as much as in them lies.

Iustitia vecchia, are certain magistrates that have power and authority to do
right unto those that do pretend hyre, wages or reward: they punish those that
do falsify waightes, measures or such like. They put a price upon such herbs
and fruits as are to be sold: likewise in their office are written up the names
of all such boys as do for wages tie themselves to the service of masters.
They were wont to deal in the matter of wools, butnow since the increase of
that merchandise, there is appointed a particular officer over the same. Al
manner of trades are under this office. They that keep shoppes have the
allowance of the signs from hence: They may be appealed from to the Cathaueri,
and to the old Auditors, according to the causes.

Consoli di Marcantanti: to this office is all manner of merchandise subjected,
wherein there is either buying or selling. They proceed briefly and by way of
extension.

Sopraconsoli are those that have to do with Marchantes that break bankerout,
and with matters of pawnes. They grant protection to such as are indebted,
whereby their bodies may be kept free from prison: they proclaim with a very
solemn ceremony those that are fugitive for debt, limiting the^ a certain time
of return, which if they do not, they then sell all such goods of theirs as
they can lay their hands on, and therewith pay the creditors as far as it
will stretch. The fugitives upon their return are bound fully and wholly to
present all their goods into this office, of which they then receive a
protection for a month, in which time they have liberty to agree with the
creditors if they can, if not, then the Sopraconsulles are to make their
agreement for them: always provided that before the satisfaction of any
creditors, the dower of the parties wife, the rent of his house, and the money
belonging to the Signeorie, if he have any thereof in his hands, are still
first deducted.

Iustitia Noua is an office to which belongs the oversight of Innes and
Tauernes, to reform their abuses and to see that their wines be not mingled or
corrupted: this office was instituted in the year 1261.

There are also certain officers over the Salt, called Signori al Sale.

Ragione Vecchie are certain that are appointed to entertain such strangers
and ambassadors as the state will have honored, and to defray such charges as
thereby shall arise to the state out of the common treasure.

Ternaria Vecchia is an office that exacteth the custom of Oils, and have
superintendence of all things thereto appertayning.

Signori alla Grassa are such as do ouersee the abuses in Cheese, salt meats,
Suet, and such like, and have power to punish those that commit any falsehood or
abuse thereabout.

Signori dipanni a ora have the charge and oversight of Goldweauers, and such
as do make cloth of Gold, Tissue and such like: to the end there be no
falsehood used, which if they find, they have authority to take the clothes
away, and to cut them in pieces.

Proueditori di Commune are certain magistrates instituted of purpose for the
common good. They are to see that such ships as be made be well wrought, and
great and capable, fit to the proportion, and that at their setting forth they
be not ouerburthened. They are to repair the streets, to paue them, and to
keep the bridges of the City in good order: all the lesser schools and
fraternities are under them, as the greater are under the Counsel of ten:
They look into the abuses of all handy crafts, and punish such as use deceit.
They have charge over the ordinary ferries. They look into the privileges of
the communalty, and tax the prices of books.

The City of Venice is divided into six parts, which they call Sestieri:
three of one side the great channel, and three on the other: their names are
thus.

In a general reuiew of the people made some few years since in Venice*
there were reckoned this number of all sorts, as follows.

Fifty nine thousand three hundred forty and nine men: sixty seven thousand
five hundred thirty and one women: youths between the age of six and of
twenty years, to the number of fifty eight thousand four hundred and twelve:
two thousand one hundred fourscore and three Friars: two thousand fourscore
and two Nuns: one thousand one hundred fifty and seven Jews.

The whole sum of all amounts to the number of 190714:

A brief description of some particularities in the City worthy to be known.

The length of the great channel, is a thousand and three hundred paces: and
in breadth over forty paces* it is wonderfully beautified on either side with
most su^ptuous and goodly palaces, you cannot go over it a foot, but at one
bridge only, which is at the Ryalto.

There are thirteen several ferries or passages, which they call Traghetti.

The bridges that join the little Isles together are in number 400: some of
wood and some of stone.

There belong to the channels 8000. Gondalas and above. The steeple of S: Mark
is 280. feet in height, and every square contains forty feet, in breadth it
is distant from the Church 80. feet, and has the same to be wrought with such
curiosity of workmanship, that the like is scarsely to be found in any other
pane of the world.

Francesco Sansouini.
AMong sundry others that have written of Venice; Francesco Sansouini is one
of the latest, who very particularly, but in my opinion somewhat superfluously
has touched not only the customs of the City, and the lives of the princes,
but also the antiquities, ceremonies, foundations, monumentes, and epitaphes of
every several church, out of whose great volume I have only extracted those
few notes, serving to my purpose, the rest I have omitted as tedious, and not
greatly needful to be known.

Venice encompasseth in circuit eight miles, being divided into 70 rapes or
divisions, which 70* churches commonly called parishes, every one of the which
is the head of that rape or division wherein it stands.

It contains likewise 59* monasteries, 31. of Eryers, and 28. of Nuns,
besides a great number of goodly schools, and most ample and stately
Hospitals.

The channels run through the city, as the veins of blood do through a man's
body, making in their course here and there innumerable little Hands* some
naturally* and some by art, which are conjoined together by sundry bridges, at
least 450 in number, all of free stone, adorned every where with most princely
buildinges, and beautiful palaces, to which there is most commodious passage
both by land and water, there are belonging to these channels between eight and
nine thousand little boats, called Gondalas, ready both by day and night, to
do service to such as shall set them a work.

The air of Venice is exceedingly good, because it The air of Venice pure and
good. The reasons of the pureness thereof.
is continually purged with the ebbing and flowing of the tides, carrying every
six hours away with it whatsoever is corrupt or unclean, besides the
multitude of fires dissolueth al noisome vapors, and the free scope of the
winds blowing every where vnhindered, makes the air most sound and
wholesome: besides much is attributed to the saltnes, which being by nature more
hot, and less cold, engenders a most equal and sweet temperature, so that
strangers with great amazement do not any where behold men more venerable and
of greater age, full of flesh, straight bodyed, of goodly presence, and more
vigorous constitution. But above all other things this is most strange, that
this air by a special privilege of nature does agree with the co^plections
of all such strangers, as resort thither, of what nation, or under what
climate soever they be borne, whether the same be subtle and persing, or
thick and foggy.

Round about them there is taken such innumerable Fish.
quantities of all excellent sorts of fish, that not only the inhabitants
have plenty of fish taken twice every day, but they also furnish the adjoining
cities upon the continent, as well those that are under their dominions, as
others.

Wildfoule.
The like marvelous abundance they have of wildfoul, so different in kind, and
so diverse in color, that it is strange to see their several sorts, their
variety being such, that we have seen above 200. several kinds of them
painted most exactly in their lively and natural colors by Marino Malipero
the most exquisite and ingenious man of his time in that art.

This city above all other is most worthy to be admired, as being singular by
her self, and brooking no comparison with any other: for what other city
soever that has been either pleasant by situation, or glorious in goodlines
of buildinges, yet it had some resemblance or likeness with others. But only
this being seated in the middle of waters, has not any thing upon the earth,
to which it may be resembled, the rare situation thereof being such, that it
inioyeth both the commodities of the water, and the pleasures of the land,
secure by being not seated upon land, from land assaults, and free by not being
founded in the depthes of the sea, from maritime violence, so that whereas
other cities do keep and defend their citizens, with walls, towers and
gates, this being naked and without ramparts, is not only (as I said) secure it
self, but renders also with admirable providence such cities, secure, as do
sleep under the watch of her wings.

Steeple of S. Mark.
Among many other rare edifices, sumptuous as well in the richnes of the matter,
as marvelous for the most singular curiosity of workemanshippe, he does
infinitely extol the steeple of S. Mark, the same being so huge high and
stately, that in fair weather it is seen and discerned of those that do sail
from Istria, being a hundred miles off in distance. The special care and
oversight thereof is committed always to a man of especial good quality and
reckoning, who has for his allowance a Marriages.
yearly stipend of 150. Crowns. The marriages among the nobility, are for the
most part always treated of by a third person, the bride being never suffered
so much as to behold her future husband, nor he her, till their marriage dower,
and all things thereunto appertaining, be fully agreede upon and concluded,
which being done the next morning the Bridegroom goes to the court of the
palace, and there the match being published, receives well wishing speeches
and salutations from such of the nobility as do enter into the palace, and
withal inuiteth his friends to the house of the brides father, to be there at
a certain time appointed in the afternoon, at the entry of the door they are
attended by the bridegroom and his kinseme^, and brought up into a hall, where
are none, but only men, and there the bride is brought forth apparelled by an
ancient custom all in white, and her hair hanging at her shoulders, wouen in
and out with fillets of gold, where being betrothed with many solemn
ceremonies, she is led round about the hall with the sound of flutes and
drums, and other instruments, and so still dancing in a soft measure, she
boweth down to those that salute her, having so showed her self to them all,
she goes in, and rerurneth out again, if any men friends that had not seen her
before do chance to come, which being ended, she descends down, and in
company of diverse gentlemen, that did all the while attend in several
chambers, she enters into a Gondola, and so being waited on with a great
number of other Gondals* she goes up and down to the Nunries, especially to
those wherein any of her kinswomen is professed, and all this showing of her
self abroad is to no other end, but that in regard of her children, and
fundrie other things, it may after happen, she may make her marriage apparent
and manifest to all men, at every marriage there is a gentleman or two chosen,
whom they call Compari, that are as it were masters of the Revels, because
their charge is to see unto the music, and whatsoever shows or pastimes
pertaining to the feast, the next morning the friends and kindred do use to
present the new married couple with sundry restoratiues and sweet meats.

Christninges.
Their Christninges are somewhat different from that custom of other places,
for the father inuiteth not two godfathers and a godmother, or two godmothers,
and a godfather, but as many in manner as they list, insomuch that sometimes
there have been 150 at the christning of the child together in the church, but
to the end that this goshipship should no way be a bar or impediment among the
Gentlemen, in matter of marriage, it was by a law ordained, that one gentleman
should not take another gentleman for his goship, whence it comes that when
the priest powers the water on the child's head, he first makes mention of the
law, and the^ demands if there be among the goships any one of the Venetian
nobility, there are not admitted to the ceremony of the christning any women
but only the nurse that has the charge of the child; the next day the father
se^deth to every gossip a marchpane and every of the^ returns back some
present or other to the child, according to the custom of the city: their
greatest magnifice^ce and charge is at the nativity of the child, for then
they do wonderfully exceed Birth of their childrent.
not only in sumptuousnes of their banquets, but also in rich furniture and
decking of their house, and great shows of riches, and stately plate and
silver vessel.

Likewise there is no part of the world, where the funerals even of the meanest
citizens are solemnized with greater ceremony and expense, neither is there any
country or nation to be found, where strangers find better entertainment,
and live with greater security.

Pastimes of the nobiltie.
The plaesures, recreations, and pastimes of the gentlemen are of sundry and
diverse sorts, among the rest, they take great pleasure in fouling, making
great matches, who can kill most foul in a day, turning the end thereof still
to banketting and pleasures. They have boats for the purpose, which they call
Fisolares, in regard that the foul in whose pursuit they take greatest
pleasure, is called Fisolo, in every of these boats they have six or eight
servants apparrelled in bluish and greenish garments, suited as near as they
can to the color of the water, who row the boat up and down, and turn her
suddenly to every side as they are commanded by their Master, who sits
close with his piece or bow, wholly intentive upon his sport, if he chance
to miss when he shoots, the Fisolo presently dyueth under the water, and
where he rises again, thither they turn their boat, suddenly with passing
nymblenes, many boats go to this pastime, together with exceeding charge to
the gentlemen that owe them, upon their return they hang the foul which they
have killed out of the windows, as hunters do upon their doors, the heads of
bears, hearts, or bores, taking it as a great reputation, to kill more of these
in a day then their fellows.

Likewise they have many ways, kinds, and instruments to take fish withal,
which the gentlemen for their recreation, do take sundry times great delight in.

There are also upon the maine land in the territories of Padoua and Vincentia,
but chiefly in Istria, goodly champaignes, fair couertes, and delightful
woods, full of all manner of chase, whither in few hours they sail from
Venice, and apply themselves to hunting and hauking sundry days together.

Matches of their Dukes.
The Duke of Venice has by ancient privileges confirmed from sundry
Emperors authority to create Earls and knights, and likewise poets Laureat,
with either of which dignities their Dukes have at sundry seasons honored and
rewarded the virtue of such as deserved well.

The Dukes have oftentimes matched in the greatest and royallest houses of
Christendom, as in their following lives partly shall be showed: which
alliance with foreign princes of great mightiness and power, growing
suspected and formidable to the commonwealth, there was a law made in the year
1327. that the Duke might not take the daughter of any stranger to his wife,
no though by privilege and adoption he had obtained the right and title of a
Venetian gentleman: and in the year 1383. it was ordained, that he should not
marry the daughter, sister, or kinsewoman of any foreign prince, without
license and consent from the great council: and in the year 1385. that he
should neither give nor receive any fee, of what sort soever: which laws and
ordinances were still from time to time corroborated and kept in vigor. His
wife is honored with the title of a princess, and spoken unto with all
reverence and in style fitting so great a dignity.

The Dukes in times past were wont in their writing to honor themselves with
high and princely styles, as calling themselves Dukes of Venice, Dalmatia, and
Croatia, and Lords of a half part, and a quarter of the whole Romain Empire,
which vanity of titles was in the year 1360. absolutely forbidden and taken
away, and this manner established, which as yet they do still retain: viz. I.
D. by the grace of God Duke of Venice, etc.

Their money is stamped with the inscription of their name, but it is not
lawful for them to ingraue, emborder or paint their peculiar arms in any
ensigns, Banners, Galleys, or places of honor but only in the frame of the
Palace.

A Breuiate of the History and lives of the Venetian Princes.
Pauluccio Anafecto. 1. Duke the year 697.
PAuluccio Anafecto was a citizen of Heraclia, borne of a noble family, and
singularly respected for his wisdom and integrity, which caused the people
to elect him for their prince. He was invested in that high honor without any
great pomp of ceremony, save only that they took his oath, that he should
always administer justice sincerely without all partiality or regard of
persons: who to satisfy the peoples expectations, did presently bend his whole
endeavor to his countries good, he appointed strong guardes every where upon the
passage of the Lakes which he fortified with Castelles, commanding and
imposing upon every town a certain quantity of armed ships to be ready
upon all occasions: he entered into league with Luitbrand King of Lombardy,
obtaining of him many Charters and privileges, whereby he did not only
greatly benefit himself, but also his countrymen and subjectes by maintaining
himself, and them in the good grace and favor of that cruel and barbarous
nation. Finally having ruled 20. years, 6. months and 8. days he dyed,
leaving behind him an honorable memory of his name, and was buried at Heraclia.

Marcello Tegaliano, Duke 2. chosen the year 717.
ALI the provincial Magistrates seeing the benefit received by the happy
government of their former Prince: assembled themselves in Heraclea and there
by common consent elected in place of the deceased Duke, Marcellus, who was
before Captain, or chief of the gentlemen, for though the high and sovereign
authority belonged unto the Duke, yet there were also assistant with him the
Tribunes, and the captain of the gentlemen; the names of which offices were
brought first into Italy by the Greeks: He was a man wise in counsel, and
valorous in arms. There happened in his time great and mortal contention
between the churches of Aquileia and Grado, for the Patriarchshippe and
pre-eminence. He by means of Pope Gregory the second, defended the Church and
Patriarch of Grado, but Luitbrand king of Lombardie, vpheld and favored
Serenus the Patriarch of Aquileia. Having ruled 9. years and 21. days, he
died in Heraclia.

3. Orso Hipato. Anno 726.
TO Marcellus succeeded Orso Hipato, likewise borne of a noble family in
Heraclia. He made at the Popes instigation war upon Luitbrand king of
Lombardie, who had besieged Rauenna, which he relieved, taking Hildebrand the
kings nephew prisoner, and killing in the field Paredo Duke of Vicenza, but
upon his return home in a sedition he was most cruelly murdered by his own
citizens.

4. Theodato Hypato. Anno 742.
AFter the death of Orso, the multitude growing into dislike of a princely
government, altered the form thereof, electing a magistrate to rule them, whose
authority should continue only a year, and th^n another to be chosen in his
place, granting him no farther dignity of title then to be called master of
the soldiers.

The first elected was Dominico Leone, the second Foelice Cornicola, the third
Deodatus son to Duke Orso, the fourth Giuliano Hypato, the last John
Fabriciaco, after the expiration of whose year, the people growing into
dislike with this kind of gouerument (in respect of a contentious war that
had passed between the cities of Heraclia and Sesolo, whereby both the one and
the other were almost destroyed, assembled themselves at Malamocco, about the
creation again of a new Duke, which was Theodato Hypato, ordayning the seat of
his Dukedom to be in Malomocco, which as then flourished above the rest both
in riches and number of men. He did for a while many notable things to the
great liking of his people: but in the end aspiring to revenge his father the
last Dukes death, and to that end fortifying strongly the Castle of Brondolo,
the people being incensed by one Galla a seditious person, and made believe
that he went about to make himself an absolute tyrant, took him prisoner, and
deprived him at once both of his eyes and Dukedom.

5. Galla. Anno 755.
AFter him succeeded Galla: but as he got this dignity by sinister practice,
so behauing himself wickedly therein, he was within the year taken by the
people, deprived of his eyes, and sent into perpetual banishment.

6. Domenico Monegario. Anno 756.
IN his place was elected Domenico Monegario, but withal somewhat to curb his
authority, there were two Tribunes appointed to assist him in the expedition of
all great affairs, but he having a fierce and aspiring spirit, contemned the
assistance of the Tribunes, insomuch that the people misliking his tirannicall
manner, deposed him and put out his eyes.

7. Mauritio Galbaia. Anno 764.
IN his steed was elected Mauritio Galbaia of a noble family of Heraclia, much
respected as well for his wisdom as his riches. He governed with such equity
and love, that the people to gratify him, were contented to give him for
companion with equal authority in government, Giouani his son. At length
having governed the state 23. years, he deceased, leaving Giouani his son
alone in the Dukedom, who also shortly after took unto him for partner in
government Mauritius his son, who going to Grado by his fathers commission,
took and spoiled the City, and threw the Patriarch headlong from the top of
a high tower: for revenge of which wicked cruelty, Obelerius and Fortunatus,
nephews to the Patriarch, entered into conspiracy against the Dukes, drawing
unto them sundry other discontented men, that were of great power: which Dukes
hearing presently fled away, Giouan to Mantouo, and Mauritius into France,
where they ended their lives.

9. Obelerio. Anno 804.
AFter them was created Obelerio Antenorio, otherwise called Anafesto, who
took Beato his brother for companion in government, and as some say, a third
called Valentino likewise his brother. But at such time as king Pepin made
war upon the Lakes, they being suspected to have given him secret favor and
assistance, were by a general consent of the people banished out of the state:
upon which the people did assemble themselves at Ryalto, and there with a most
happy beginning did choose for their Duke in the year 809.

10. Angelo Participatio.
WHo first builded the Dukes palace, where it now stands: he admitted
Justinian his son to partnership in rule with him: and lastly after eighteen
years reign, and reputation of a good Prince, he ended his days, and in his
place succeeded him his son.

11. Giustitiano Participato. Anno 828.
WHo recalled his brother from banishment, to which he had been for his evil
demeanor condemned, and gave unto him equal authority with himself in rule:
he sent out a navy in defense of the kingdom of Sicilia against the Moors.
In his time the body of S. Mark was brought unto Venice, for which he
builded a Chapel, and after he founded the Church of S. Zachary. Finally,
being oppressed with infirmities, he ended his days before he had full ruled
two years.

12. Giouani Participatio. Anno 129.
GIustinian being dead, the government remained in Giouani his brother, but
with harder success, for he was molested with many unquiet accidents: for
Obelerio that before was banished both from the Dukedom and his country,
returned in arms with sundry of his confederates to Malomocco, raising new
broiles, wherein he had at the beginning some success: but finally the Duke
besieged Malomocco, wherein Obelerio had fortified himself, and lastly consumed
the same with fire, taking Obelerio prisoner, whose head he caused to be
stricken off, and to be picht upon a stake in the middle of the market place.
Shortly after one of the Tribunes called Carolo, or as some say, Carosto, by a
conspiracy took the Dukedom from him, and compelled him to fly: but he
being also shortly chased away and deprived of his eyes by the people, Giouani
was recalled back, who growing into deadly contention and quarrel with the
family of the Mastalitions, being then mighty and puissant, both in riches and
authority, as also in the number of friends and allies, was by them again
taken in S. Peter's church, and confined to Grado, where shauing his crown, he
entered into religion, and finally ended his life.

13. Pietro Gradenigo. Anno 837.
PIetro Gradenigo, or as some say Tradonigo, being elected Duke, took unto him
his son Giouani to be partner of his rule, and dignity, he builded the
church of S. Paul and made war upon the Narantines, he set out threescore
sail of ships against the Moors, and finally was slain by treason in the
church of Saint Zachary.

14, Orso Participatio. Anno 864,

of the happy government of his ancestors, as also of his own virtue and
sufficiency was chosen Duke, who discomfited presently in battle the Sarazens,
who had committed great outrages and spoils upon the coast of Dalmatia, he
was by Basilius the Emperor honored with the title of chief Swordbearer, and
lastly ended his days in the year 881.

15. Giouani Participatio. Anno 881.
HIs Son Giouani succeeded him in government, who married a niece of the
Emperors of Constantinople, he made war upon the Earl of Commachio, who had
way laid and murdered his brother Baldoaro, as he iournyed toward Rome, he
spoiled his country, and took the Earl himself prisoner, he accepted with
equal authority into the Dukedom his brother Pietro, who dying soon after,
he voluntarily renounced the Dukedom.

16. Pietro Candiano. Anno. 887.
ANd in his place was chosen Pietro Candiano, who in a battle soon after
against the Narantines was slain, and his body brought to Grado, where it was
buried, upon his death, the people requested Giouani Participatio to take upon
him the rule again, which with great unwillingness he did, but having
therein continued about half a year, at his instant pursuit, he was thereof
again released.

17. Pietro Tribuno. Anno. 888.
ANd in his place was elected Pietro Tribuno: he fortified Venice by drawing
of a wall from the river of Castello to Sancta Maria Zebenico, though there
remain not now of the same any token at all, he vanquished the Hunnes,
overthrew Berengarius the Emperor, and dyed full of glory and happiness.

18. Orso Parcicipatio. Anno. 912.
ORso Participatio; or as some call him, Orso Baduaro, second of that name
succceded him, a man singularly wise, religious, a lover of justice, an
Almes-giuer, of great courage, and accomplished in every requisite virtue, he
had a son called Pietro, who was of the Emperor Corradus honored with great
dignities, and especially with privilege to coin money, but finally being
weary of the worlds vanity, and turning himself wholly to contemplation, he
voluntarily renounced the Dukedom, and entered into religion in the Monastery
of S. Foelix in Ainiano.

19. Pietro 11 Candiano. Anno 932.
TO Orso succeeded Pietro Candiano son to Duke Pietro that was slain in
Dalmatia by the Sclauonians, a man of great modesty and fitnes to govern: his
son Pietro was created chief Swordbearer of the Empire, he took and burned
Commachoo, he made war upon the Istrians, and made Iustmopolis tributary to
the state of Venice, he dyed the seventh year of his rule.

20. Pietro Participatio. Anno 939.
PIetro Participatio or Badoaro, having been prisoner with the Istryans, upon
his return was created Duke, and dyed in the second year of his rule, to the
exceeding sorrow of his Citizens.

IN his place was chosen Pietro Candiano third of that name, son to Pietro
the second, he had two sons Dominico and Pietro, the first he made Bishop of
Torcello and the other, he took to be his partner in the Dukedom, who
behauing himself insolently, and being thereof reprehended by him, took
publicly arms against him, but the people reuerencing the authority and
withal pitying the age and grief of the Father, pursued the son so
sharply, that they took him, and had slain him, had not the old man used
great instance to save him from their fury, in the end to satisfy the father
they spared his life, but sent him into banishment, solemnly swearing all with
one consent, that they would never admit him for their prince, neither during
the life of his father, neither after his death, the young man fled to the
Marquis Guiao, son to king Berengario, of whom he was with great humanity
received and presented to the king his father, who took him with him to the
war of Spoleto, thence with the kings leave getting himself to Rauenna, and
there arming certain ships, he took seven rich ships of Venice laden with
merchandise, that were sailing to Fano, the grief of whose unnatural
disposition and undutiful behavior, so grieved the old man that he dyed in
the year, 959.

22. Pietro Candiano. Anno 959.
THe people being assembled together, about the choice of a new prince, so
strangely were the minds of the Bishop and the multitude changed, that whereas
by solemn oath, they had once vowed never to live under the government of
young Pietro, now they did not desire any thing with greatervehemence, insomuch
that they went to fetch him from Rauenna to Venice in triumphs with 200.

Marquis Guido, whose dowry was great and rich, Girolomie Bardi. calls her
Vadetta and says that she was daughter to Alberto L. of Rauenna.
not only in money and Jewels,, but also in Castles, and fortresses, insomuch
that growing insolent therewith, he called in mercenarie soldiers to the
guard of his palace and person, in fine his manners were so outrageous, and
himself grew so odious to the people, that asse^bling themselves in a fury
they slew both him and his little son within his palace, which they burned
to the ground.

23. Pietro Orseolo. Anno. 976.
THis great outrage being committed, they elected Pietro Orseolo for their
prince, who being of a noble family, and from his youth wholly given to
devotion, was marvelous unwilling to accept this high dignity, fearing least
the same would be a hinderance to the contemplature life, which he chiefly
desired, he had by his wife Foelicia one son and no more, like to him both in
name and condition, he repaired the church of S. Mark, and the walls of Grado,
and succored Bari against the Sarazens, at length falling into acquaintance
with one Guarino Abbot of S. Michaels of Cusano in Gascoyne, he grew so far
in love with the reverence of his person, and the integrity of his conditions,
that determining to abandon the world, having first distributed great gifts
among the poor, he departed one night in disguised garments with the said
Giouani, which Giouani Gradinigo and Giouani Morosmo his son in law, and
Romualdo, and Marino of Rauenna, without saying a word thereof either to his
wife or son, he took with him much money which he bestowed in adorning the

a Friar, sending in the mean time for his brother Ottone to Constantinople,
he himself by the consent of the people, till then, supplying the Ducall
room, which Dominico Flabanico and his adherents that had been cause of

thereunto by the people: so that his election was orderly, and not with tumult,
as that of the former princes: he was 70. years old, when he was chosen: his
countenance and disposition was pleasant, and his riches great beyond measure.
He was the first that at his election threw money about the streets, according
to the custom of the Greekish Emperors: the same to this day being still
observed in Venice. By his means there were created also certain Magistrates
with high authority, somewhat thereby to bridle the puissance of the Dukes,
being before that time in manner absolute, as namely the six Counselors.

In his time Pope Alexander the third came unto Venice, being chased out of
Rome by Frederic Barbarossa the Emperor, in whose defense the Venetians made
wars upon the Emperor with a mighty navy, with which they discomfited his
fleet upon the coast of Istria, taking Otto his third son being General
thereof prisoner, by whose intercession and means to his father, there was an
atonement concluded, the Emperor appeased, and the Pope again restored with

garments, bowed himself down to kiss the Popes feet who keeping in the
mean time his gravity, pronounced the words of the Prophet: Super Aspidem and
basiliscum ambulabis, and conculcalbis Leonem and Draconem: to which the
Emperor answered, Non tibi sed Petro: the Pope presently replying, Et mihi
and Petro.

Signeory of Venice, did honor the same again with many benedictions,
privileges and ceremonious dignities, as a sword, a scepter, a chair of gold,
a torch of Virgin wax, all sanctified with many blessings, still thence after
to be borne before the Duke, and among the rest upon the victory obtained by
the Duke at sea against the Emperors son, he gave the ring which he ware upon
his finger unto the Duke, with express condition, that he should yearly with
such a ring spouse the sea, in token of a true and perpetual dominion over the
same, which ceremony is even till this time observed with great solemnity
every Ascension day. Besides these the Pope granted many and great indulgences
to the church of S. Martin in Venice, and to S. John's church in Istria. The
Signeorie of Venice before this time was unacquainted with those external pomps
and honorable titles, which by prerogative from the Pope they then obtained,
and from that time to this have strictly observed. In fine this prince having
by many notable deeds exceedingly enobled his country, dyed full of glory, in
the sixth year of his rule: leaving by testament a great and infinite riches to
the Signeorie of S. Mark: underneath his picture in the palace is written
this inscription.

Ducatum titulis dotaui ingentibus atque

40. Orio Mastropetro. Anno 1178.
NExt after this worthy personage, was chosen Orio Mastropetro. In his time

Saladine, and then renouncing the Dukedom, made himself a Friar and died.

41. Henrico Dandolo. Anno 1192.
THe next elected was Henrico Dandolo, a man aged in years, but fresh in
courage, and highly honored for his great deserts: he recoured Raguse to the
Signeorie, and having done many notable things, dyed in the 13. year of his
rule at Constantinople.

42. Pietro Zani. Anno 1205.
PIetro Zani son to Sebastian, succeeded with election and general approbation
of the whole City: in his time came Ambassadors from Athens to do homage and
obedience to the senate: he married the Lady Constance daughter to Tancredi
King of Sicilia. In his time were the four horses of brass that are yet to be
seeene in S. Mark, sent from Constantinople to Venice: it is certainly
written, that they were cast and engraven by Luippus the famous workman, and
given to the Romans by Tyridates King of Armenia, and from Rome brought at
last to Constantinople, by Constantine the Emperor. Finally the Duke gave up
his dignity, and putting himself to a private life, died after the 24. year
of his Dukedom.

43. Iacomo Thiepolo. Anno. 1229.
IN his room was enstalled Iacomo Theopolo. He raised the siege of
Constantinople: he made truce with the Genoweses, by mediation of Pope Gregory
for nine years: he sent 25. Galleys into Puglia, under the name and authority
of the Pope, and threescore to aid the Genoweses against the Emperor
Frederick. Being old he surrendered up the Dukedom in the 20. year of his

S. Paul.

44. Marino Morosino. Anno 1249.
MArino Morosino followed next after, in whose time began the custom of

images still representing their memory. He dyed in the 4. year of his rule.

45. Rimeri Zeno. Anno 1252.

Duke: being at that time Governor of Fano. He married a young Lady of a great
and noble house in Dalmatia: he married his two sons Iacomo and Pietro to two
great Ladies, the first to a princess of Slauonia, Lady of many Castles and
towns, and the other to a Lady of great riches and nobility in Vicensa: which
foreign alliances were no whit at all pleasing to the Senate, insomuch that
after his death they made a law, whereby they restrained both the prince and
his children from allying themselves by marriage, with strangers: in his time
Fano, Bologna, and other bordering cities revolted from the state of Venice,
but they were by him chastised and brought again to obedience: at the end of
six years he dyed, and was buried in the same tomb with his father in the
church of S. Paul and S. John.

47. Iacomo Contarino. Anno 1275.
NExt to the deceased prince was Iacomo Contarini with universal applause
enstalled in the Dukedom, being Procurator of S. Mark, and at that time 80.
years of age: in his time was the law made, that none should have any entry
into the great council, or have any part at al in the government, unless he
were able to prove himself to be borne and begotten in lawful matrimony:
growing afterward into a great indisposition of body: at the request of the
fathers, he renounced the Dukedom, who providing him of honorable means to
live, created in his place,

48. Giouani Dandolo. Anno 1280.
THe enstalment of this Prince was memorable, by mean of two great and
dangerous accidents that presently ensued, the one by the swelling and
inundation of waters, the other by a terrible earthquake, either of which did
exceedingly endamage the state: in his time were coined the first ducats of
Gold, which are now called Zechines. He died in the tenth year of his rule.

49. Petro Gradenigo. Anno 1290.
Never was there any Duke of greater expectation and hope then this Petro
Gradenigo, as being in deed a man of rare and singular courage, wisdom and
eloquence: at his first entrance inot government he suppressed a great and
dangerous conspiracy intended against him: he fought at the first prosperously
by sea with the Genoweses, but afterward was by them overthrown in Dalmatia,
and likewise in the streightes of Gallipolis, after which there was a peace
concluded: in time of this Duke it was ordained that none should be capable of
the Dukedom by election, unless he were of the great council, likewise then
was first the beginning of the council of the ten: he sent a navy into
Greece, which returned victoriously with many prisoners, and rich spoils,
after which he dyed, not without the suspicion of poison: his body was carried
to Murano, and there buried in the church of S. Ciprian.

50. Marino Giorgio. Anno 1311.

integrity of life, but being 81. years of age, he soon departed this world.

predecessors, and departed this world after he had ruled 18. years.

52. Francesco Dandolo. Anno 1328.
IN his place was elected Francesco Dandolo: in whose time there was at one
instant threescore sundry Ambassadors from several princes and commonwealths
in Venice, desiring to have such controversies as were among them ended and
decided by the Senate, such was then the same of the uncorrupted justice of the
Fathers. He made a league with sundry christian princes against the Turk: he
had wars with the Princes of Scala, with whom in the end he made peace to his
own advantage: he lived in rule 11. years.

53. Bartolomeo Gradenigo. Anno 1339.
ANd in his steed Bartholomeo Gradenigo was created Duke, upon whose entering
into government, the waters arose so high, that the city was in exceeding
danger of drowning. Candia rebelled, but was again subdued: he lived only
three years.

54. Andrea Dandolo anno 1343.
THe next that was honored with this dignity was Andrea Dandolo, procurator of
S. Mark, a man very wise and learned, and having before time proceeded Doctor
in the laws, he wrote a very large and copious Chronicle, not only of his
own Country, but also of the whole world, he lived in dear and familiar
friendship with Petrarke, he confederated himself with Pope Clement and sundry
other Princes: he sent a navy against the Turks, which took Smyrna, he
obtained traffic for Venetian marchantes into Egypt, he lived twelve years,

Alta trium probitas mihi quarto suggeret instar,

55. Marino Faliero. anno. 1354.
NExt in rank was exalted to the Dukedom with exceeding favor of the one and
forty Electors, Marino Faliero, having long before by the Senate been employed
in foreign governments, and besides ennobled with the title of Earl of Val de
Marino, he was 80. years old, very rich, of an excellent wit, well speaking,
but passionat and cholerike beyond measure, insomuch that for a scorn or
wrong, which he imagined to beedone to his reputation, he entered into a
practice to tyrannize over his countries liberty, and to make himself absolute
prince, rather as they write, moved thereunto with a humor of revenge, then
desire of dominion, being without children, and withal so aged: but the end
was, he was taken and beheaded in the very same place, where he received the
Ducal diadem, his picture was not suffered to stand in the Palace among the
others, the place remaining yet bare and void where it should have stood.

56. Giouaui Gradenigo. anno 1355.
THe former unhappy prince being buried, and his conspiracy being suppressed
in a manner before it was publicly known, Giouani Gradenigo was chosen in his
place, a man of 76. years of age, of profound memory, and skillful in the
laws, but unseemly of his person, and withal somewhat noted of covetousness,
he lived only a year, three monethe; and foutteene days.

57, Giouani Delfino. anno 1356.
GIouani Delfino being proueditor within the city of Treues, at that time
besieged by the king of Hungary was by the Senate in his absence elected D. of
Venice, and presently in Embassage sent to the Hungarian by the Venetians, to
give safe conduct and free passage to their prince, but he barbarously
triumphing in having enclosed a Duke of Venice within those walls, attributing
that casual unexpected accident to a great glory of his own, discourteously
denied the Senates request, which Delphine understanding took an occasion to
make a sally out of the town, and in despite of the enemy recovered Mergara,
where he was received of the fathers with great joy, and under him ceased the
difference of those wars, the king voluntarily surrendering unto him the title
and claim to Dalmatia, he dyed in the 4. year of his rule.

58. Lorenso Celsi. anno 1361.
LOrenso Celsi was next elected, who conquered Candia that rebelled, he dyed in

stout, eloquent, and a great lover of his Country, he lived only two years.

60. Andrea Contarini anno 1367.
ANdrea Contarini being exceedingly loath to accept this dignity, and to that
end withdrawing himself to Padoua, was nevertheless elected by the Fathers,
and constrained to take upon him the government, which he did with great
comfort to the city, but with marvelous discouragement to himself, because it
had been foretold him, that whenever he should come to be Duke, the
commonwealth should labor with extreme affliction to prevent which he bent
his whole endeavor and care to the well discharging of his dignity: but divine
deliberations are not to be resisted, for not long after he found himself
entangled with many dangerous wars, as with the Tryestines, and Leopola Duke
of Austria, and with Francisco de Carrara a most sharp and bitter enemy to
the very name of the Venetians, who had contracted against them a League, which
the King of Hungary, the Patriarch of Aquilia, and the whole commonwealth of
Genoua; insomuch that besides a general revolution and change of Fortune
through the whole state, the Genoweses encroched so near upon Venice, that
they took from it the city of Chroggia, threatening utter ruin and
subversion to the whole state: but in this greatest downfall and calamity,
such was the constant virtue and resolute courage of the Venetians and their
prince, that assembling the remainder of their force together, they assailed
with such fierceness the Genoweses in Chroggia, that they did not only
recover the city, but also discomfit their enemies in a famous overthrow, to
the marvelous glory of their Duke, who was there in person, they brought back
with them to Venice, 4142 Genowes prisoners, who in manner all ended there
their lives, and 2600. Padowans; besides the Duke brought with him among many
other ensigns, banners and standards, the shield of the Captain general of
the Genoweses, as a chief Trophei, the same being made of hardened leather,
according to the fashion of that time, but very gorgeously guilted and embosted
with the picture upon it of S. George a horseback, being the arms of the
co^monwelth of Genoway, the D. ended his days in the 15. year of his Dukedom,
he was buried in S. Stephens church, with this Epitaph written in Gotish
letters upon his Tomb.

Hic sacer Andreas stirps Contarena moratur,
Dux patriae precibus, senior qui Ianua ciues

Amissam Veneto clugiam pacemque reduxit.

picture in the palace is written.

Paucadamus patriaefestina morte repressi.

62. Antonio Veniero. anno 1381.
ANtonio Veniero next succeeded, being then captain general for the state in
Candia, a man of such severity and justice, that he sharply punished his own
son for having committed a youthful insolence, he succored the Emperor
Emanuell against the Turks, he maintained and preserved the Duke of Mantua,
in his state against the Duke of Milan: he obtained the Isle of Corfu, not
long afterfalling into infirmity, he departed this life.

presently upon his creation the king of Denmark at his instant and earnest
request was adopted into the number of the Venetian Gentlemen, the said king
and Ihon Paleologus Emperor of Constantinople, met both at one time in Venice,
the Emperor to crave succor against the Turk, the king to take passage
thence toward Jerusalem, with intent to visit the Sepulcher of Christ,

one to request money and means of defense against the Turk, the other to
entreat the Senate to take upon them the decision and arbitrament of certain

70. Pietro Mocenigo anno 1474.
PIetro Mocenigo being procurator of S. Mark, and of the age of 69. years, was

principal employments abroad for the commo^wealth, chiefly in the wars, whereof
there is a particular treatise written by Coepio Coriolan, that lived in those
times, he lived only 14. months after his enstalment.

71 Andrea Vendramino. anno 1476.
ANdrea Vendramino was 84. years of age when he was elected Duke, he had been
in his youth one of the most beautiful and comely Gentlemen of Venice, and in
all respects accordingly accomplished, he made war against the Turk, and
defended Croy in Albana, which they had besieged, constraining them to raise

of peace entertained, the Duke departed this life in the 20. month after his

73. Marco Barbarico. anno 1485.
MArco Barbarico succeeded him being 73. years of age, he was wholly inclined
to peace, and bent to the maintenance thereof his whole intentions, but death
cut him off in the very first year

74. Augustino Barbarico anno 1485.
AVgustino Barbarico was elected to succeed his brother Marco, he banded with
the other Italian princes against Charles eight of France, then newly by
solicitation of Lodowicke, Sforce entered into Italy, for the recovery of the
kingdom of Naples, to which he pretended title in his time, the Portugals
first found out the voyaging into the Indies, to the exceeding prejudice of
Venice, who before had thence al their spices, with which in a manner they
furnished all the western provinces of Christendom, he dyed in the 15. year
of his Dukedom, and in his place was elected.

75. Leonardo Loridano. anno 1501.
Never was the commonwealth of Venice nearer to shipwreck, then in this
princes time, for the greatest princes of Christendom did solemnly at Cambray
combine themselves in league against their state, as the Pope, the Emperor,
the king of France, the king of Spain, and the Dukes of Mantua and Ferrara,
every one of which powered down armies upon them, they were overthrown in a
memorable battle at Ghiaradada, and in an other at Vincensa, so that they were
feign to abandon in a manner, all that they possessed upon the firm land, to be
shared and divided by the Conquerours, yet nevertheless fortune turned about her
wheel again in such sort that they recovered themselves, wherein the
histories of that time do attribute exceeding much to the wisdom and virtue
of their prince. Finally, being nere to 90. years of age, he fell into an
infirmity by reason of a fall which he had received, and dyed in the year
1521. His body was honorably entombed in the Church of S. John and S. Paul.

ANtonio Grimani had been first a Procurator, and deprived of that dignity,
and banished to Cherso, yet afterward was recalled again, and restored to his
first dignity, and shortly after elected Duke, which honor he enjoyed only a
year, two months and two days, and then dyed.

77. Andrea Gritti. Anno 1523.
IN his place was elected Andrea Gritti, a man in deed excellent in all
prefection, and worthy of that dignity. The great matters that passed in his
time are so excellently and copiously written by Giouius, and Guicciardin, and
others of that time, that it were in vain here to make any abridgement of
them. He ruled 15. years and seven months, and then dyed at the age of 83.
years.

78. Pietro Lando. Anno 1538.
PIetro Lando being confirmed Duke maintained his commonwealth neutrall
between Charles the Emperor, and Francis the French King, who were entangled
together in a most fierce and cruel war, and thought there was scarcely any
prince in Christendom but followed the one side or other, yet never could
they notwithstanding many earnest solicitations made by them both draw the
state of Venice to favor the one more then the other. Having ruled 7. years
he dyed.

79. Francesco Donato. An. 1545.
FRancesco Donato, being Procurator of S. Mark, was a man of great eloquence,
and singular capacity of spirit and therefore his election applauded of the
multitude with great joy: he did many laudable things, and lastly died in the
seventh year of his rule, and was succeeded by Marcantonio Treuisano.

80. Marcantonio Treuisano. Anno 1553.
THis Duke was maruellously religious, just in all his words and actions, and
of so extraordinary a charity toward the poor, that he gave them (in a
manner) all that he had: nevertheless his end was strange and pitiful, for
at the end of his first year he fell down suddenly dead as he was kneeling
before the altar at Mass, the inscription under his picture in the palace is
thus.

Religionis amantissimus, Anno circn^acto moriens in gremio patrum ante aras in
celum vnde veneram, vitae integer euolaui.

81. Francesco Veniero Anno. 1554.
THe next placed in the Ducall throne was Francesco Veniero, being then 64.
years of age: he lived only two years, and in his place was elected Lorenzo
Priuli.

82. Lorenzo Priuli. Anno 1556.
LOrenzo Priuli was a man wholly given to religion and quietness: there was no
great thing done in the time of his Dukedom, which he only enjoyed three
years, and then departed this world.

83. Hieronimo Priuli. Anno 1559.
HIeronimo Priuli, as well in regard of his own virtue as the happy and quiet
government of his brother Lorenso, was with general applause established in
his room. In his time was celebrated the Council of Trente: he died in the 8.
year of his rule.

84. Pietro Loredano. Anno 1567.
PIetro Loredano was a senator of great gravity, wise, religious, and of
singular integrity and soundness in his actions: in his time the famous
Arsenall of Venice, wherein all their store of powder and munition was
contained, was casually set on fire; the noise whereof was so extremely
hideous, that it was heard 40. miles off: presently also ensued the calamitous
war of Selim Emperor of the Turks, who upon the death of his father Soliman,
aspiring to some honorable conquest, took arms against the Senate,
pretending title to the kingdom of Cypres, utterly forgetting his fathers
admonitions, his promise made to the Senate, and the long amity that had been
between them. In fine he invaded Cypres with a mighty army, and took after
long siege the two great Cities of Nicosia and Famagosta, practicing all kinds
of imaginable cruelty upon the poor Christian captives: in the mean time
while the Venetians were busied in preparation of forces to encounter him, the
Duke not able to withstand the affliction of age, sickness and so many
troubles, yielded up his breath in his fourth year of government.

85. Aluigi Mocenigo. Anno 1570.
THe next thought worthy of this high honor, was Aluigi Mocenigo, a man
accomplished in all virtues that to so great a dignity were requisite: he
appointed Sebastiano Veniero General of the Venetian forces, to unite himself
with Marc-Antonia Colona, General for the Pope, and D. John d' Austria for the
king of Spain, who together gave that mighty and memorable overthrow to the
Turks at Lepanto, in manner in the very place where Augustus Caesar vanquished
Anthony his Competitor. In his time Henry the third, King of France returning
upon the news of his brothers death out of Polonia passed through Venice,
where being arrived, he was received and entertained of the Duke and Senate with
marvelous joy, pomp and magnificence. Finally, this Duke to the great
discomfort of the commonwealth died in the seventh year of his rule.

86. Sebastiano Veniero. Anno 1577.
PResently upon the death of Mocenigo, Sebastiano Veniero, in reward of his
glorious victory against the Turks, was without contradiction of any of the
Electors enstalled in the Dukedom, with greater gratulation and applause then
ever before time had been seen at the election of any former Duke. The Pope
sent a solemn embassage to congratulate with him, and withal sent him in
token of his worthiness and virtue, the Rose of Gold, a present never sent but
to mighty princes, and such as had employed themselves in the churches defense:
but all this honor and his life also ended within a year, after that he had
received the Ducall diadem, even at such time as he was busy about the
preparation of a sumptuous and triumphall feast, which he intended to make in
honor of his wife, the princess Cecilia Contarina. The Archduke of Austria in
admiration of his virtue sent an Ambassador of purpose to the Senate to demand
his picture.

87. Nicolo da Ponte. Anno 1578.
NIcolo da Ponte was fourscore and eight years old at time of his election:
he was a Doctor of Law, a knight and Procurator of S. Mark, and had passed
with exceeding commendation through all the offices and dignities of his
commonwealth. He died in the year 1585. and in his place was elected Pasqual
Cenoca.

88. Pasqual Cenoca.
1585.
