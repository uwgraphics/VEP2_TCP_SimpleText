Jeremy the Prophet / translated into Englisshe: by George Joye: some time
fellow of Peter College in Camebridge.

The song of Moses is added in the end / to magnif ye our Lord for the fall
of our Pharao / the Bishop of Rome.

Anno.M.D. and.xxxiiii. in the monethe of May.

The Preface.
THe Prophets / as they were al taught / steredvp / and thrusted forth of one
spirit to preche and write the word of the Lord: so folowd they al one threde
and line tending unto one end / even our savior Jesus Christ the parfait
some and full conclusion of all the law and Prophets. So that whosoever in reding
the law and Prophets / direct his inward eye to behold and know our
heavenly father for ye one very Johan xvii.
God a lone with his sone Jesus Christ sent us from him / beleuinge perfitly to
be justified and saved by the grace of God ye father through ye merits only of
Cristis death very God and man / he reads a right with great fruit / he
recheth and rests graciously upon the same mark that all the Prophets did
shote at / eue^ upon him that said. Johan xiiii.
I am the way / the truth / and life. Upon this gloriouse and saving sign
to be again said (as Simcon told Mary ye virgen his mother Luke ii.) the two
testamentis also looked with contrary aspectis / the old beholding him to come
/ ye new loking upon him paste and comen: no another wise then the two Cherubyms
standing upon the arc of the covenant did figure: Exodi. ^xv.
both loking contrary wais / ye one beholding the the other / and yet did they
both two set their eyes loking into the propiciatorye / eue^ upon Christ our
seat of mercy / and mercy stole. Matthew. xvii.
And hither looked also those two sufficient witnesses Moses and Helyas / the
one representing the law and the the other the Prophetis / when Christ
transfigured himself / both concluding and consenting with Christ / in that
they talked together with him expressing his end which he should make and
finesshe at Jerusale^. ^uk. ix.
For whom else aftir that gloriouse sight and communication did his disciples
there se but only Jesus left alone? What so ever therefore Christ did / or
suffered / as touchi^g the benefit and form of our redemption / the law and
Prophetis told it al before. So that the talking together of Moses and Helias
with Christ declared the law and Prophets to consent and agree both upon
Christ ye very health life and perfeccio^ of al yt believe in him. Which thing
to confirm / the voice of the father was there herd out of the cloud sayng.
This is my dear beloved sone / for whose sake I am peased and set at one with
man: him therefore / se that ye hear. Observe diligently (good Christian reder)
the veheme^ce and pieth of this pronowne Ipsum / when the father commanded us
sainge: Ipsum audite: him se yt ye hear. And beware of them that would obtrude
and thrust in to the church of Go^ any unwritten verities strange doctrine /
even the doctrine of lying men. Hear them not which would co^mande and compel
us to believe and hear any other techer then Christ / and siche as their
doctrine be consonant with Crystis word / apere they never so holy / and well
learned. Jere. v and.xxii
Let sich false Prophets (as Jeremy whissheth and threteneth) go and be ruled
of ye wind / which preche us to worship images or to seek any other help /
salvation / intercessours and means between us and our father then Christ
Jesus alone sufficient / ever herd and praynge for us incessauntly. Johan iiii.


Christ therefore to show himself that lively fountayn of perpetual waters
plentuously springingforth into life everlasting unto all that drink / that is
to say / believe in him / sat him down once full weary to rest himself upon
the well bring which Jacob long before had dug: evermore seking an occasion
to insinuate and offer himself a sufficient refrigery and savior for sinners
/ what time he opened himself unto that sinful Samaritane woman telling her:
that who so drink of the water which I shall give him / he shall neuermore
thirste etc. That is / who so believe in Christ / shall never desyer any other
mean / savior / counforter and refressher: but shall find and feel God the
father one alone for all sufficient through the grace and merits of his sone our
savior Criste: In him only to glory and rejoice as this Prophet commands
us. Jere. ix.
Which glory who so once taste and feel / he will not only give it to no
another as in Isaie is showed: Isa. 41.
but he will tremble and quake to hear this greuouse complaint and heavy
manasshing of God almighty by the mouth of Jeremy saying: Jere. ii.
My people have cast me away which am their glory / they have changed their
glory for yt an Idol yt cannot help the^. As here now the Prophet entered
into the argument and matter of al his sermons and of this hole book / and
brekynge forth into a great fereful exclamacion / calls in Isaie. i.
heaven and earth (as did Isaye in the beginning of his sermons) to testifye /
and detest our abominable idolatrye / criyng out thus: Oh heuens / be ye a
stonned / be ye a frayd and meruelously amassed says the Lord. For two
offencis have my people committed. They have forsaken me / even the very lively
fountayn of perpetual waters: and dug themself up pittis al to trodden and
broken which may hold no waters. The heue^s to be a stonned and to deteste
this bakfalling from Christ our glory unto any other creature / is as much to
say as oh heuens with draw your help and counforte from us: give us nether
rain nor any ceasonable wether / nor yet holsom air / but acording as it was
thretened us in ye law / be ye as hard Deute. xxviii*
as yern that ye earth might be as hard as stele: Jeremi xiiii.
for rain to give us drought and heat / to bake our land in baraynes / for
pleasant wether to give us thondre and terreble lighteningis: corrupt ye ye
air / yt pestelence might take away man and beast. And yet as* though all this
were to little / sword and famyn be threatened us to* ye and at last to be
casten out from Christ our glory in heaven unto perpetual payn^ in he^ / For
forsaking Christ our glory and diggi^g us up these poisoned pittis of our own
invention / pittes alto trode^ / troubles / and broken / eui^ the traditions /
laws / and decrees with all the deuellisshe doctrine drawn forth of these
dampnable deluers ye bisshops of Rome and their faccion deluing and digging us
up their muddye and myery stinkinge dykes al for to feed their own carnal
affectis / to maintayn their glitering glory / and to increase their fylthy
lucre / and stalbeshe their falsely usurped power: whereby they have hitherto
and so long deluded and seduced many a simple soul / and trapped and holde^
captive even Emprours and kings: And how they theirselues daily trouble and
break their own dry pittes with dispensacio^s relaxacio^s permissions gloses
etce. they know and feel it yt have paid for drinking of their golden cup /
which that abominable hoar of ^poc. 13.
Babylon as Joha^ describes her sitting in purple / scarlet / and gold decked
with preciouse stones holds yet in her hand full of abominations and the
filthenes of her own-luste. But as for her pestelent pittes / they may hold
none of those lively refreshing waters which Criste offered unto ye Samaritane
woman / and daily offreth thez unto us to call us from these popish puddelle
/ unto himself the very perpetual spring of everlasting life. Isa. 30.


These dirtye deluers ye Prophet Isaye calls also web weauers agenste ye
mind of ye lord / detesting and abhorring their laws and traditions:
threatening them for their digging up of siche unsavory pittes / woe and
everlasting dampnacion: Isaye.x. sayng woe be to you yt make ungodly laws and
set statutes to hard to keep to oppress ye pore in judgment / and utterly to
beggar my sorry simple people with strife and law / yt the destituted al help and
counsel might be a proye for you and so to rob the fatherless. etce.

Wherefore now at last / it has pleased almighty God to call forth Jerermy
his Prophet / to send and to set him as a brason Jere. 1, and. 15.
wall and pillar of yerne to preche in englisshe agenst this heavy monster of
Rome and al his draffe. Jere. 1*
He has showed Zeremy ye rod of the wakinge watcher / and the seethinge
pot boyillinge forth as it were from ye north este / altogether threteninge
the heuye burdens and present vengeannce of God shortly to be powered forth
upon this Babylonik beast. So yt who so read ye.xlviii.xlix.l. and.li.
chapiters of this prophet / he shall se there clearly ye present face of ye
soden miserable fall of the Pope and his kingedome now at hand so lively set
forth / under ye names of proud (...) / his brothere Ammon / and Babylon / yt
no Ap^elles could have painted it more presently. Now therefore (good Christian
brethren) let us be warned intyme / and hear the exhortacion of Jeremye crying
upon us sayng. ^ere. 51.
Fle from out of ye mids of Babylon and let every man save himself / let
noman dissemble nor hold his tongue at her wikednes. For verily Babylon which
is Rome is as wyked and sinful as it is reported and descrybed / as al her
ungodly living and deceaitful dedis openly testifye and declare her.

But to speak of the iestis and prease of Jeremye / ye shall know that these
his sermons declare of how high a spirit and fervent faith he was: but his
chance (as be the chances of all trwe prechers before the world) was most
miserable and hard / as one of those that preched the word of the Lord God
both prudently and constantly unto his death / nothing abashed at the
threateningis of the ungodly kings and preistis that reigned in his later
days. Which constancy / most commendable in any precher could not come but
of a perfait and ferme faith in God. Which faith being present / a non the
heart of the precher is endwed and strengthened with all vertwe and goodness.
^ebr. 11.
For faith will have ye victory and overcome al perels. But yet was his lyffe
troublouse / for that the plages / burdens / and that miserable captivity /
which hte Prophetis all threatened before to come / it was his chance to se
them / and to be partaker of the perellouse payns / and heuye destruction
which he also prophesied unto them himself / and not only suffered this
greuouse temptacion / but Jere. 4^
was also violently carried captive of his enymes into Egypt / aftir that Juda
and Jerusalem were all destroyde and carried captives into Babylon / yet was his
doctrine and sermons all this troublouse time both godly / loving / faithful
and prudent / For he exhorted them swetely and lovingly / he rebuked sharply
and ernestly / and preched evermore as faithfully and constantly. So that if we
behold his faithfullnes / he is fervent. If we consider his erudicion and
doctrine / he shyneth. If we look upon his prudence / it is right sauourye and
well ceasoned. If we behold his godlynes / he excedeth. And as for his
constancye / it is invincible and bears a way al ye victory.

With how deep sighis sorowed he the bakfallinge of the people from their God?
What lamentacions made he for that he had so long with so great perel preched
to them al in vain / and also for the captivity of the people and miserable
destruction of Jerusalem? what goodly comparisons and sensible similitudes
brought he in / when he preched to persuade and call the people to repentance?
As when he preched the destruction of the cite in Tophet / where to lay ye
thing more manifest and present at their eyes / he smote the two erthen
pitsherdis to ^ere. 19.
gither breking them al to pieses before his audience / saing. Thus says ye
Lord of powers. Even thus shall I alto break and destroy this people and cite
like as a potter breketh a vessel which may never more be restored. This did
he to fere and to move them to repentance. For that orator and precher
persuades most vehemently which helps his oracion with convenient iestures /
apt similitudes and most present affectis. So that in the Prophetis sermons
there is no siche hardness and difficultye as some men complayneth of / except
ye sloughisshe and sleapye reder nothing excercysing himself in readinge
diligently and reverently the holy scriptures bring it with him / and so
himself be the very cause why he brings away so little fruit in reding them.
The Prophetis be the expowners and declarers of the law and not ye obscurers
and derkeners there of: Pet. 1.
they be as Peter says the light set up in a derke place unto which he
exhorts us diligently to attend. What argument so ever they take in hand to
declare and prove / they never leave it until they have so often / so many ways
and with so many sensible similitudes and apt co^parisons set it forth yt every
hearer be he never so simple and rude may se and understand it clerly. How
compasses Jeremy about with so many words comparing the bakslyding of us from
god / to aduoutrye calling us unshame faced her lettis and our images whom we
seek our lovers etce. and al to bring us again unto Crist our spouse from our
fornicacion committed (as he often says) with stocks and stores? Anatho^ was
a l^^tel tow^ne in the tribe of Beniam^n. iii mile n^ the we^^ from J^rusalem
wherei^ Jeremy was bo^^ne.
Nether could the unkind dealing of his own folk of Anathot / nor yet the
false behavior of the rulers agenst him once turn his mind from them. There
could no king for all their threatening / presonment and punisshing make him to
sherink or cease from his office that god called him unto. But evermore aftir
any fall (he was a man) he rose agene more fervent / more constant and ernest
then ever he was before. Whom lo / now (Christian reder) thou have in thy hands
preching unto the in Englisshe the same sermons which he preched unto the
people of Juda and Jerusalem corrupted with the same sins wheryn we now
labor and be as grievously infected: whom no less greuouse plages affliccions
and burdens abide / if we repent us not and turn not to our spouse Jesus
Crist him with the father and the holy ghost one God to whorship and serve
only. Which give us grace so to read and hear this his Prophet that he
might preach unto us with more fruit thou he preched to the Iwes: Amen.

But first ere we begin to read him. Let us hear the state and brief
succession of those.iiii. kings / in whose days / and how long / Jeremy
preched.

Jolias / the last good king of Juda / reigned.xxxi. year. He had these.iii.
wiked sons / Joachas / Joakim / and Zedechias. The story begins the.xxii.
chapter of the fowerth book of the kings and co^tinweth unto the end of the
book. Jeremy begane to preche in the.xiii year of Josias / so continewing under
him.xviii. year. Aftir Josias / reigned Joachas / and that but.iii. months /
and then was he led captive into Egypt. Then reigned his brother Joakim.xi.
year / and then was led captive unto Babylon. Aftir him reigned this Joakims
sone called Joachin or Jeconias.iii. months and.x. days / and was led also
captive unto Babylon. Then last of al was Zedechias the third sone of Josias
choson of Othe^^wyse called Na^buchod^^zar.
N^buchadrezar king of Babylon / to be king of Juda. Which Zedechias
aftir.xi. year / Jerusalem taken and destroyed / was led also captive to Babylon
/ his eyes put forth / but his own childern first slain before his eyes /
that so greuouse and painful a last sight might be printed and ever present in
his mind into then creasing of his perpetual pain and sorrow while he lived.
The time therefore while Jeremy preched / unto the captivity came / was.xli.
year.vi. months / and.x. days. Here may we se in how troublouse a time
this Prophet preached. For doutelesse these iiii. kings were not led a way
thus capti^ed out of their own land with out great calamite / bataile / and
blodesheding.

The fawtes escaped in the printinge.

Ah lord etc. In the.xiiii. lef / second side / second line / Read Ephraim.

These ar the actis and sermons of Jeremy the son of Helchie Priest / one of
those that dwelt in Anathot / the region of Benjamin. Unto whom the word of
the lord was showed. First in the days of Josias / son of Amon king of
Juda / the.xiii. iiii. book of kings. capi. xxii
year of his reign / and so duringe through the time of Joakim son of Josias
king of Juda / until.xi. years of Zedechias the son of Josias king of Juda
were ended / when Jerusalem was taken even in the fifte month.
The word of the Lord was sent unto me / speking thus.

The first Chapter.
BEfore I fasshioned the in thy mothers womb / I knew the: and before thou were
borne / I sanctified the: and ordined the to be a Prophet for the people. Ah
lord God / thou know how rude I am of speech: for full young and simple am I.
And the Lord answered me. Think not so: for thou shall go preche unto all that
I shall send the: and thou shall speak what so ever I shall command the: Fear
not their faces / for I wil^^ with the to dilyuer the / says the lord. And
even forth withal / the Lord stretched forth his hand / and touched my
mo^the: saing agene unto me. Behold I s^t my wordis fast in thy mouth / so
Jorden the this day to be an o^erseer to viset both the people and their kings
/ to pl^cup by the roots and to cast down / to destroy and to scater / and
that thou shuldst also edifye and plant. Eft sone aftir this / the Lord spoke
to me on this manner / sayng: Jeremy / what first thou? And I said / I see the
rod of a waki^g watcher. Well (said the lord to me) thou seist right well:
for even I shall watch and wait apo^ my purpose to finesshe it. Over this the
lord spoke unto me the second time sayng: What siest thou? A seething pot
quod I / do I see: and that even from the north as it were hitherwards loking.
And the lord said to me: Even from the north shall there be powerd forth an
heavy hea^ of plages upon all thinhabitours of this land. For lo / I shall calup
all the kinredis of the northest regio^s says the Lord / and they shall come:
and each of them shall sit and judge openly even in these fore gates of
Jerusalem / and in all the walls rownde about it / and thoroute all the cytes
also of Juda / by whom I shall declare my vengeance upon the great and manifold
wikednes of these men which have forsaken me / offering their giftis unto
strange goddis and worshipinge the workis of their own handis. Thou therefore
gi^d up thy raynes / arise and go preche unto them al thingis that I command
the: Fear not their faces / lest for thy f^inte faith and fere / I make them to
prevail. For lo / this day do I set the a strong defensed cite / a piler
of yerne / and a brason wall agenst all this land / agenst the kingis of Juda
and her rulers / agenst the priests and people of the land: wherefore they shall
fight against the: but it shall not lie in their power to overcome the: for I
shall be with the (says the lord) to deliver the.

The second Chapter.
THen was the word of the lord showed unto me / commanding me thus. Go and
krye into the ears of Jerusalem / sayng. Thus says the lord. I cannot forget
the / especially when I remember my merciful covenant with the / and again the
goodness of thy yougthe. I cannot forget thy true love in marriage / whereby thou
followed some through the deserte / a land unlabored and unsown. Thou waste
once an holy Israel before the lord / eue^ the first fruits of his field: so
that whosoever had denoured the they had displeased him: and mischefe should have
fallen upon the^ / said the lord. Hear ye therefore the word of the lord /
both you that be of the house of Jacob and all the familye of the house of
Israel. Thus says the lord unto you: What fault or fraud fownd your fathers
in me / to go so far back from / and to be made so vain as to follow lies?
nether yet once to think / where have we left the lord / that led us out of
the land of Egypt / that brought us through that desert / thorou a wild land
harbourles / a terrible baron land where we saw but death / through a land
which no man passed by / and in the which noman dwelled. And when I had brought
you unto that fat land of Carmelus to take your pleasure of her fruits and
commodites: you went your ways and defiled my land / and made mine heretage
abominable. And even the priestis / they do not once remember me sayng: where
is the lord? The learned in the law / they know me not. And as for the
pastors / they sin agenst me. The prophets they preach al for Baal his
profit / and ar gone aftir ydols which cannot help them. Wherefore I am utterly
constrained to co^tende in judgment both with you and your childerne says the
lord. For go your ways unto the eylandis of Cethim / and behold: send into
Cedar and consider diligently whither there be any siche thing done? ye / look
whither the gentiles have castou^e their goddis? albeit in very deed / they be
no goddis. But my people has castawaye their glory for an Idol that cannot
help the^. For this thing therefore: Oh heavens / be ye astouned / be ye a
frayd and meruellously amassed says the lord. For two great offenses has my
people committed. They have forsaken me / even the very lively fountain of
perpetual waters: and dug them up pittis al to trodden and broken which may
hold no waters. Is Israel a bo^de slave / or rather the good ma^nis son of
the house? And wherefore the^ is he gone into a proie? Wherefore rore they upon
him like lions? They have brought their land into a wilderness: Their cites ar
so thron down and brent / that no man may inhabit the^. For theffeminat
childerne of Memphes and Thanneos have polluted the / even up unto thy nek.
Hapened it not thus unto the for that thou forsokest the lord thy god even
then when he would have directed the in the way? And now: what have thou to do
in the way to Egypt? To dri^ke trowbled waters? Or what make thou in the
way to Assyrye? to drink the waters of the floude? Thy nowne malice shall
reprove the: and thy nowne bakslydinge from God shall condemn the: that thou
may know and understand how perniciouse and perelouse a thing it is that
thou have forsaken the lord thy God / dreding him nothing at al says the
lord God of powrs: when even from the beginning I broke of thy yoke and thy
bonds / for that thou complaynedst and praydst me to make an end of thy
bondage. But for all this / yet thou stodest forth offering thy body to be
abused upon every high hill and under every broad branched tree / Oh harlet: ye
and that even while I went about to plant the / that thou mightist have been
altogether of that noble vine stock and of that faithful sede. How art thou
this alienated fro me into so strange and barayn a vyneyarde out of kind? In
somiche as wasshe thou thy selue never so clean with Fullers earth.
Nitro. And powder thy selue never somiche with O ^rias.
Borith. yet art thou spotted with thy nowne wikednes in my sight says the
lord God. Nether cannest thou say: I am not so polluted / nether have I gon^
aftir goddis: For look upon thy nowne ways in wodis and valeis / oh swif^
Cam^l / and thou shall se what thou have done. Thou have run unto these
places like a sw^fte ast^ling drom^dary and with as fi^^ce a desire as the
wild asse^^ wo^te in wilderness for his pleasure to brea^h himself. Who could
refrain the? who soever seek the out shall find the evermore in thy
menstrwe. When we forbode the these ungodly peins taking / saing: Go no more
bare foot to these Idol / keep thy throat from thirst. Thou answerdst us
saing / we will not / we care not for these pains: for our love is set upon
strange goddis / and eue^ them will we follow. But as the thief is a shamed when
he is espied: eue^ so be ye confounded oh house of Israel. Both the people /
yea their kings and rulers / Prestis and prophetis al be ye ashamed and
confounded. For they say their Pater noster unto a stock / and to a stone they
say: Thou art my mother: they have turned me their back and not their face.
But in time of their trouble when they shall say: Arise and help us: I shall
answer: Where ar thy goddis whom thou made the? Let the^ rise and save the in
time of thy affliccion. For look how many cites thou have (oh Juda) so many
goddis have thou. Wherefore co^tende ye with me since ye be al sinners agenst me
says the lord? I smite your childern / but al in vain: for they receive not
my disciplyne. your sword deuowreth your prophetis like a devouring ^^o^. ye
ar the people of the lord: look therefore upon his word. Am I become a
wilderness or a derke land to Israel? Wherefore than says my people / let us fall
from him and come no more at him? Do the maid forget her chief orname^t or the
wife her goodly girdle? And does my people forgete me so long? Wherefore set
thou forth and co^me^dest thy nown ways to be so good as to find favor for
the^: when even thy selue have stained thy nowne ways with sin? For under
thy wings is there found the blood of pore innocent souls: and that not in
corners and holes only: but openly in all these places. And yet dare thou
say: I am an innocent: wherefore his indignacio^ may not light upon me. But
behold: I will co^tende with the in judgment / because thou think sayng: I
am no sinner. But how filthy a sinner shall thou apere / when it shall be
declared openly / how often thou have returned and repeted thy nowne ways? For
thou shall be ashamed as well of egypt as of ^ssyrye. For thou shall go hence
with thy handis cowpled over thy head. For the lord shall frustrate thy hope
and confidence and f^l litel prosperity and conforte shall thou find in them.

The third Chapter.
IT is thought commonly / that (if a man put away his wife / and she now go an
marye hirselfe to a another) it will be asked: shall he any more take her again?
For is not this field now defiled? But thou have played the harlet with many an
herdema^: nethelesse turn again to me says the lord. Lift up thy eyes and
look up unto al these qua^ters about the / and se whither any place be
undefiled. Thou satest down by the ways waiting for the^ in the desert like a
thief / insomiche that therthe was polluted with thy sins and horedome. Hereof
ceased the small raynes and ceasonable showers. Thou have gotten the an h^rsets
forehed and cannest not be ashamed. O^els / even now thou woldst have called
unto me / sayng: Oh my father / thou art the goyde of my yougth / and will thou
be turned fro me for ever? wylt thou hold thy self from al ways? But lo /
thou both spekest and doist euel more and more. Also the Lord said unto me in
the time of Josias the king: Seist thou not what Israel that bakslyder from
God has done? Which went her ways upon every high hill and under every thick
tree and their played the harlet? Nethelesse when she had committed all this / yet
I said / turn the agene to me: and yet she turned not. And even thyssame
ens^mole has her faithles sister Juda seen. That is to wete: When I had
perfaitly beholden al thaduoutery of Israel that bakfaller / and had forsaken
her / giving her a bil of ^iuorse: yet would not Juda her unfaithful sister
fear me / but went away to / and played the harlet: so that the fame of her
fornicacio^ is flone through all this land and has stained it: for she has
committed aduoutry with stones and stocks. Nether is this her faithles sister
Juda aftir al these warningis returned unto me with all her heart / but faynedly
and falsely / says the lord. And yet again said the Lord to me. Israel that
bakfaller fro me / is more just than is yet this unfaithful Juda. Go thy way
therefore and preach this sermon towerd the north / sayng. Be converted thou
bakslyder Israel says the lord: for I shall not turn my face from you: for I
am merciful says the lord / nether will I abhor the for ever / but receive
the age^ on this co^dicyo^ that thou will acknowledge thy sin committed agenst
the lord thy god / and that thou have divided and offered thy self here and
there running aftir strange goddis under every thik tree: but my voice thou
wolost not hear says the lord. Be converted you rebel bakslyden childerne
says the lord: and I will join in marriage with you. For I will take one of you
of the cite / and two of the kinrede and led you into Zion. And I shall give
you herdemen aftir my nowne mind which shall feed you with doctrine and
wisdom. And when you shall be increased and multiplied in the land: than
(says the lord) the arc of the lordis covenant shall no more be spoken of
nor minded / no mencio^ more shall be made thereof: for it shall no more be visited
nor honored with oblacio^. The^ shall they call Jerusalem the seat of the lord /
and all the gentiles shall be gathered unto it for the name of the lord which
shall be given to Jerusalem. Nether shall they follow anymore the counsels of their
own shrewed hertis. Than shall they that are of the house of Juda go to the
house of Israel / and come both to gither from the north region unto the
land which I gave your fathers. I showed the how I purchased the in to the
nowmbre of my childern / and gave the that desyerde land so pleasant a
possession and also that noble host of the gentiles: commanding the to calm
father and not to fall back from to any other godds. But as the woman breketh
her promise to her housbonde / so have thou broken promise with me / Oh house
of Israel says the Lord. Wherefore the noise of the childern of Israel shall be
herd al about wailing and weping because they have defiled his ways / and
forgoten the lord their god. Be converted you baksliden childern / and I shall
heal your bakslydinges. Say / lo we are thine / for thou art the lord our
god. Very liers ar the hill toppis with the pomp of the mountayns: Netheles in
the lord our god / very health comes to Israel. But shameful dedis devoured
both the labors of our fathers eue^ from their cradles and also their flocks
/ herdes / sons and daughthers. We shall sleep therefore in our own confusion
/ and our igno^^^ye shall cover us. Forboth we and our fathers be sinners agenst
our lord god eue^ from our cradles unto this day / in that we obay^ not the
voice of our lord god.

The fourth Chapter.
But Israel / if thou will turn to me / if thou will turn to me says the
lord / and remove al thy abominacions out of my sight / and be no more a
runagate aftir false geddis: but swear. The Lord reigns / ye and that in
truth / in judgment and ^ightwisnes / saing: The ge^tylis might be blessed in
him / and praise and thank him: than thus says the Lord unto al Juda and
Jerusalem: you shall break up and till your land / and sow it not for thorns.
Be circumcised in the lord and take away the vncircuncision of your hertis al
ye citesens of Juda and Jerusalem: lest my indignacio^ come forth like fire and
be kindled noman to quench it for your maliciouse counsels. Tell forth in Juda
and Jerusalem / preach it sayng: Blow forth trompettis into the land / fill it
al with your noise sayng: Get ye together and go into your strong defensed
cytes. Lifteup a sign in Zion. Haste ye and tarry not / for I shall bringeforth
a plage and great destruction from the north. For the haithen destroyer is let
slip and comes forth of his place like a lion from his den / to bring
thy land into a desert / to smite down thy cytes that noman may inhabit them.
Wherefore clothe your selves with sack / moorn and howl. For the hot
indignacion of the lord shall not be slaked from you. In this day says the
Lord / the heart of the king and hertes of the rulers shall faint and fall.
The Preistis shall be a stonned and the Prophetis al amassed. And I said: Ah lord
god / haste thou then deceived this people and Jerusalem / sayng: ye shall have
peace and now the sword pearseth their lives? In that time it shall be said unto
this people and to Jerusalem. There comes an hot wind from the sowth plage by
the way of my people / nether to win^w them nor to cleanse them. Aftir this / my
vehement strong wind shall come: and then shall I teach these men my
iugements. For lo / he shall ascend like a cloud / and his chariets shall be
like a stormye temreste / ye and his horsemen swifter than a^gels. Woe be unto
us / for we are utterly destroyed. Wash thy heart from evil o Jerusalem / that
thou maiste be saved. How long shall thy deedly and pe^^ciouse thoughtis tarry
with the? For from Dan and from the mount Ephraim there is haide a noise that
pronos^^kth and precheth death. Lo even the gentyles give warning and tell
Jerusalem that there come destroyers from a far land. They tell it also the
cytes of Juda / warning them rownd about as do the watch men of the feldis:
for they have angered me says the lord. Thy counsels and thoughts hare
brought the these thingis. This is thy nown malice and rebellion which has
posseded thy heart. Then shall thou cry / My belly my belly ^keth / my life in
my breast sorowth / my heart withyn me is tr^wbled: I cannot be still. For my
soul has herd the voice of the trompet / and even the dolorouse peal to
death and destruction is now ronge / even now all the land perishes. Suddenly
shall my tabernacles be destroyed / and my cortayns in the twinkling of an eye.

How long shall I se these cruel tokens and hear the voice of the trompet?

These therefore shall come / because my people has despised me and ar besides
their wits. My childerne ar fools and without understanding. They are wittye
to do euel but to do good they are al witless. I beheld the earth / and lo it
is vain and void. I looked upon the heavens: and lo they have not their light
/ I lifted up my eyes to the mountayns / and lo they reeled lykely to fall / and
all the hills shoke. I looked about / and lo there was noman left. Also all the
fowls of the air were flone away. I behold / and lo Carmelus was become a
deserte / al her cytes thro^downe of the lord and of the fury of his wrath.
For thus sp^^^e the lord. All this land shall be desolate. But yet shall I not
utterly make an end of it. Wherefore wail earth and moorne heaven above: for of
this thing which I have thought and decreed / it shalnot re re^ent me / nether
will I go from it. Every cite shall fle at the noise of the horsemen and bowme^.
They shall run into caves and wodes and clyme into rocks. Every cite shall be
left a lone noman to inhabit them. Wha^ thou art thus destroyed / what shall
thou do? If thou clothest thy selue with purple / and deckest the with golden
ornamentis / if thou payntest thy eye brews with starche / yet shall thou
garneshe thyselfe in vain. For they that loved the hitherto / shall looth the
and go about to quench thy life. For me thinks I hear a voice as it were of
a woman traue / ling of child / or of one labori^g in the travel of her first
child: that is to say the voice of the daughter of Zion moorning and
complaining in her self casting her arms abroad sayng: Ah less for sorrow /
for my life fails in me for the slain.

The fifte Chapter.
GO look upon Jerusalem with out: and consider it also withyn: and seek
thorowt every streate / whither ye can find any one man that either does right
or studieth for faith and troth: and I shall spare the^ says the Lord. For
albeit they say. The lord lyneth / yet is this their oath to deceyne / wha^
thy eyes (o lord) look for nothing so miche as for faith. For thou smittest
the^ and yet they repented not. Thou correctedst to amend the^: but they would
not receive thy disciplyne. They hardened their faces more then any stonne /
and refused to turn to a better mind. Whereupon I considered with my self
thus / paradue^ture they are so poor that they cannot know the way of the
lord and iugeme^ts of our god. I shall get me therefore unto the great estates
and talk with the^ / if paradue^ture yet these me^ may have the knowledge of
the way of the lord and the iugeme^ts of their god. But these men eue^ like
al other have broken the yoke and plucked in sondre their bridle raynes.
Wherefore the lyo^ shall come from the wode and deuowre them. The wolf at
theuening shall destroy the^. The leoparde shall lie awaite by their cytes to
tear in peaces as many as come out frothence. For they have heaped sin upon
syn / and their bakslydingis ar right greuouse. Tell me then what thing have
thou where fore I should be mercyful unto the? Thy childerne have forsaken me /
and swear by the^ that are no goddis / when even I myself had bownde the^ to me
by an oath: and yet ar they aduouterers haunting harlettis houses. They are be
come as fyerce in prodigiouse libidinouse lust as fat stallau^des / every
man neiathe at his neighbors wife. Shall I not be avenged upon these things /
says the lord? And should not I take vengeance of what nation so ever it be
that is like unto this? Clyme up to her walls and through them down / tarry not.
Cut of her branches and battleme^^s for they belong not to the lord. For the
house of Israel and Juda has cast me away unfaithfully / says the Lord /
sayng: It is not he that is God. Nether shall there come siche affliccio^ upon
us. Sword and honger we shall not se. Wherefore these Prophetis shall go their
ways into the wind. And he that should preach shall not come among them.
Even thus shall it be dealt with the^. Wherefore thus speaks the lord god of
powrs. Since ye speak this word: Lo I shall turn my words which thou
speak with thy mouth into fire / and this people into wode / that it may
devour them. Behold I shall bring upon you a nation from a far (o house of
Israel says the lord) a strong boystiouse nation an old nation whose tongue
thou shall not know nor understand what they say. Their quyuers shall be thy
present grave: for all they are full mighty. This nacio^ shall eatup thy corn and
food: they shall eat thy sons and daughters: they shall devour thy flocks
and droues. They shall eatup thy vyneyardis and figs. And beat down thy
defensed cytes with sword in who^ thou trustedst most chiefly: and yet thus
than will I not cease nor make an end with you says the lord. And when they
shall say: wherefore shall our lord God do all this unto us?

Thou shall answer the^. Because that like as ye have forsaken me and served
strange gods in your own land: even so shall ye serve strange gods still in a
strange land. Show this to the house of Jacob / and preche it in Juda sayng:
Hear (I pray the) this thing thou folesshe and hertlesse people. ye have eyes
but yese not / and ears but ye hear not. Will ye not dread me says the lord?
Will ye not fear my face / which have pinnedyn the sea with sands: ye and that
with this law to / that she shall never pass over them? She makes a face with
great vehemence / but yet she may not: She swells up into her high waves /
but yet she breaks not her law. But this people has a faithles and
rebellious heart. They are fallen back and gone their ways so far / that
they think not once in their hertes. Let us yet fear the lord our God which
gives us rain in time / and ceasonable showers for our profit / preserving us
our corn according to the duwe order of the year. your own wikednesses have
turned these things from you. And your sins have depryued you this great
commodite. For in my people there ar fownde the ungodly which bend snares
preuely / and wait to destroy men and to take them. And as the net is full
of birds / so ar their houses full of goodis gote^ with dissaight. And hereof
rise their stoutenes and riches: hereof ar they magnifyed / made so fat and
full of tresure. Also they have offended me with the most grievous crimes. They
ministre not the law. The cause of the fatherless they expede it not. The
pore mannis wrong / in judgment they deliver not. Shall I not be avenged of
these thingis says the lord? And should I not take veneaunce of what so ever
like unto this? Thingis to be woundred at and gretely to be fered ar now done
in this land. The Prophetis preche lies / and the Preistis obaye and rejoice
in them. And my people have great pleasure in these things. But what shall come
of this at the last? Verily / even this.

The sixte Chapter.
GEt ye forth of Jerusalem / ye strong sons of Benjamin. And blowup trompets
ye men of Thecua: and let there be a toke^ lifted up unto Bethacherem: for there
comes a plage and great destruction from the north. I shall make the daugther
Zion like a fayer tender one / that the pastors with their flocks might come
to her to pitche their te^tis rowndaboute behind her / each one to feed upon
men yildedup into their handis. But shall I be plain? Bend ye ernestly to
bataile against Jerusalem Arise / and let us go up while it is yet middaye. But
ahlasse the day declyneth and the dark evening drawth fast upon: nethelesse
arise / and let us go up eue^ in the night / and throdowne her goodly strong
defenses. For thus commands the lord of powers. Cutdowne her trees and
rearup a bulwerke agenste Jerusalem. This is the cite that must be visited:
for it is full of violence and unjust vexacion. As the cesterne keeps and
encreseth her cold waters / even so nouresheth this cite her malice. Theft
and injury ar hard in her. Sorrow and wounds ar ever in my sight. Be thou
rather nourtred and amend o Jerusalem / lest I withdraw my heart from the /
and leave the desolate / no man to inhabit thy region. For thus says the Lord
of powers. The rea^mant of Israel shall be plucked away as men were wont to pyke
of the grapes left aftyr the grape gatheri^g. Turn thou thy hand therefore
into the maunde like the grape gatherer. But unto whom shall I speak and
testify myself that he would once hear? Their ears ar so uncircumcised that
they may not receive my word. For lo / the word of the lord is put of them
in the place of obprobrye and shame / they set naught by it but reuyle it.

But Lord I am so repleynesshed and laden with thy fury that I labor in great
sufferaunce. Have done at once therefore and power it forth upon the childerne
in the stretis and also upon the company of the yongemen. For the man with his
wife / and tholdema^ with the bederede shall be taken / and their houses shall be
translated unto oother / as well their feldes as wives. For I shall strechforth
my hand unto the dwellers of this land says the lord: because that from the
leest of them unto the gretest every man is given to covetousness / and from
Prophet to priest every one does dissaightfully and lyingly. But yet in the
mea^ ceason / to put my people out of fear: they go about to heal their
breach and destruccio^ with this lie / preaching peace peace / wha^ there is no
peace at al. Wherefore / they shall be ashamed because they have committed
abominacio^: what said I? Ashamed? When they are paste al shame and with out
al fear. Wherefore they shall fall among the slain / and in tharticle of my
visitacio^ they shall come down altogether says the Lord Thus says the
Lord. Comeforth unto the ways. Consider and serchout the pathe everlasting:
that yet if this way be good and right / ye might walk theryn and find
rest for yoursouls. But they say / we will not walk theryn. yet said the
Lord. And I shall set overseers over you: Give head therefore / especially unto
the voice of the trompet. But they say / we wilnot give head. Wherefore / hear
ye gentyles / and se ye folk gathrede together what I have ordined for them.
And thou earth hear also / I shall bring a greuouse plage upon this people /
even the fruit of their own counsels. For they obayed not my wordis nor my
law / but aborred them and casted them away. For what intent bring ye
encense fro Gaba? and this good fragra^te spyce from so far contreys? your
offringis displease me / and your sacrifices delight me nothing at al. Wherefore
thus says the Lord. Behold I shall send a ruin among this people / and
thershal fall the fathers with their sons / neighbors together one with
another shall perisshe. Also thus says the lord. Behold a populose multitude
shall come from the north parts / and a great nation shall be steredup from the
coostis of therthe armed with bow and bokeler / a nacio^ both boystuouse
fyerce and mercylesse / their voice rorethe like the sea: they come ryding /
eueryone well appointed and bente to fight agenste the / oh daughter Zion. Here
as soon as we shall hear of these tydingis / our handis shall be dissolved /
anguisshe and heaviness shall hold us as a woman traueling of child. We shall
say / let noman go forth into the field / noman go by the highewaye. For
both sword and the fear of our enymes shall occupye al places.

Girde the therefore with sak / oh daughter of my people and sprinkle thyselfe
with ashes: take the to moorning as it were for thy only dear beloved son /
and lame^te as thou shuldste for them whom thou may not leese with out many
a bitter tear: for in the twi^kling of an eye / this destroyer shall be upon
you: whom I have set upon my people as a tryeroute of metal to try them and to
disclose their ways. For they are forsakers of me and traitors. They honte
aftyr filthy lucre / they are brass and yerne / for they hurt and destroy al.
The blower of the fire with the belows shall faynte / the lead shall fail: the
tryer out of the silver shall try in vain / for they are worse then worthy to
be melted. Wherefore they shall be called forboden and reproved silver / for the
Lord shall refuse them.

The.vii. Chapter.
THis is the word given unto Jeremye from the Lord sayng. Stand up in the
gates of the house of the lord / and preach this sermon with a loud voice
sayng. Hear the word of the Lord al ye that hau^te these gates entering in to
worship the Lord. Thus says the Lord of powers the God of Israel. Amend your
ways and counsels / and I shall make you to inhabit this place. Put not your
confidence in the words of liars sayng. The temple of the Lord / the temple
of the Lord / the temple of the Lord is here. For if ye amend and redress
your ways and counsels / and do right to every man / if ye do no wrong to the
stranger / to the fatherless and poredestitute / if ye shede no innocent blood
in this place / if you follow not strange gods into your own destruccio^: I
shall cause you to inhabit this place in the land which I gave your fathers
from age to age. But lo / ye trust in deceaitful counsel and lyi^g words
which shall not profit you. For when ye have walked altogether in theft /
murder / adultery and perjury: wha^ ye have offered to Baal and followed strange
gods / ye and even unknown gods / the^ at last ye come and stand before me in
this house / which bears my name / and ye say / we be absolved / ye although
we had committed al these abominacions.

Think ye that this house which bears my name is made a den of thieves? And
these things are not done preuely but openly in my presens / says the Lord.
But go your ways (I pray you) to my place in Silo / to the which I gave my
name some time / and behold what I did to it for the malice of my people
Israel. Now therefore because ye have committed al these dedis says the Lord.
Notwithstanding yet I rose fulerly continually warninge you in time / I spoke
but ye would not hear / I called but ye would not answer / I shall do (I say)
therefore unto this house to who^ my name was given in which house also ye
trust: I shall do (I say) to this place which I gave you and your fathers even
as I did to Silo. And I shall cast you out of my sight as I casted out al your
brothern / even all the sead of Erhraim. Now therefore pray thou not for this
people / nether bid prayer nor praise for their sake / nor make no intercession
to me. For in nowyse will I hear the. Seist thou not what they do in the cites
of Juda and without Jerusalem? The childern gather sticks and their fathers
set them on fire. And their wives strewe and sprinkle their flower to make fine
cakes for the queen of heaven. The ^one.
Over this yet they offered to false gods to anger me / albeit there is no siche
affecte in me / says the lord / ought they not yet rather tobe a shamed of
their own selves? Where fore thus says the lord God. Behold my wrath and
indignacion shall be powerdforth upon this place / upon man and beast / upon the
trees of the field and upon the fruits of therthe: and it shall so brenne that
noman may quench it. Thus says the lord of powrs / the God of Israel / ye
join and heap together your burnt sacrifices with your slain beastis to be
offered / but eat you the flesh your self / for as for me I spoke nothing of
these unto your fathers: how miche less tha^ was it my mind / when I brought
the out of the land of Egypt to command these ceremones of burnt
sacrifyces and oblacio^s as my chief and first precepts? But this was the
substance of my first precepte. Ex de. x
Hear and obaye my voice / and I shall be your god / and ye shall be my people /
this condition added / that ye walk in all my ways which I shall command you
for your health. But they obayed not nether gave ear / but walked aftir the
lusts and craftye counsels of their own shrewd hertis / and became froward
and nothing toward / ye and that even from the same day that your fathers
went out of Egypt unto this day. And I sent them my serua^tis / all the
Prophetis rysinge and busely warninge them in time / but they listened not to
me / nor yet once inclined their ears: but hardened their proud necks and
became far worse than their fathers. And thou thyselfe now to / shall also
speak unto the^ al these words: but they shalnot give ear unto the: thou
shall call them / but they shall not answer. Wherefore thou shall say unto the^.
This is the people that hereth not the voice of their lord god / nether
receives his discipline. Faith is gone and banesshed from their mouths.
Therefore clipof the hears of thy head and cast them a way / take the to
moorning thoroute all the land. For the Lord wilcaste away and scater the
generacio^ with whom he is anger. The Childern of Juda have done evil in my
sight says the Lord. They have setvp their own abominacions in my house
named aftir my name and so polluted it. And they have builded an auter at
Topheth which is the vale of Benhinnom to brenne their sons and daughters in
the fire / which thing I never commanded nor minded. Wherefore behold the time
shall come says the lord / wha^ it shall no more be called Tophet or vale
Benhinnom: but the vase of the slain. For they shall be buried in Tophet because
they can get no another place: and the carkases of this people shall be meat for
fowls of the air and for wild beasts of the earth / and there shall be to noma^
to chaar the^ a way. I shall make a vacacion of the voice of gladness and of the
voice of joy / of the voice of brydegrome and brydewyfe from the cites of Juda
/ and the region of Jerusalem. For the land shall be left desolate with out
inhabitours.

The.viii. Chapter.
AT this time says the lord: they shall bring forth the bones of the kings
of Juda / and the bones of her rulers / the bones of Preistis and Prophetis and
of the cytesens of Jerusalem / out of their sepulchers: and shall lay them
abroad before the sone / moan and all the company of the stars / whom they
loved / whom they served / aftir whom they went / who^ they sought and
worshipte. They shalnot be gatherdup nor buried / but lie still like a donghil
above therthe. And all that shall be left of this wiked generation shall desyer
rather to dye than to live. Whersoeuer they shall become as I shall scater the^ /
they shall be but (as ye would say) a left reamnant says the lord of powrs.
Also this shall thou say unto them. That thus says the Lord: Do men so fall
that they never arise up a gene? Are they so auerted that they will be never
converted? How is it than that this people and Jerusalem be auerted so steifly
for ever?

Their stourdines increases / they wilnot be converted. For I have beheld
them and herkened / but there is not one that once thinks on this / not one
repentith him of his sins sayng / what have I done? Or wherefore have I done
thus?

Every one aftir that he was once auerted / he ran fro me like an horse that
runs neaing into bataile. The storke knows her appointed time / the turtle
/ the fwalow / and the crane observe the time of their forthefleing: but my
people know not the time of the vengeance of the lord. How then hapeneth it
that ye say. It is we that are the wise / it is we that have the law of the
lord? se therefore they are but very lies which the false pe^ne of the scrybe
payntethe. Wherefore the wise shall be ashamed / they shall be afraid and be taken /
for lo / they have throne a way the lord. which gone / what wisdom than can
there remayn in them? Wherefore I shall give their wives to strangers / and their
feldes to their destroyers: for from the least to the gretest al gape for
filthy lucre. From prophet to priest al ar liars. But in the mean ceason
they heal the breach and affliccion of my people powdering it with this lie
sayng: There shall be peace / there shall be peace / when there is none at all.
Fygh for shame / they commit abominable and shameful deeds and ar past al
shame. Wherefore they shall fall among the deed carkases and shall come down
together in the day of their visitacion says the lord. I shall cause them to
be gathered up and taken away says the Lord. Like as there is not a grape
left in the vine / nor a fig on the figtre / and as leaves ar fallen a way
/ even so shall I cause them to be carried away captiued while they be at their
wits end saing: Come and let us go into some strong cytes / and let us
abide there with silence. For our Lord God has put us to silence and given us
to drink water mengled with gall because we sinned agenst him. We looked for
peace / but there came no good: we tarried and waited for the time of health /
but lo / al is syknes and trowble. Than shall the neaing and noise of their
horse be herd from Dan. At the noise of their harnes and armed horse men all the region shall falldowne. For they shall invade and devour this land and what
so ever is in it / both cytes and dwellers in the^. And over this yet shall I
send into among the^ kokatrices and serpents whom they may not charm / and
they shall stinge you says the lord. I am oppressed with sorrow / and heaviness
holds my heart. For lo / the loud voice of the daughter which is my people
shall be herd from a far contrye / saing: Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not her
king in her? Whereunto the Lord shall answer. Wherefore have they angered me
with their karue^ images and strange vanites? Harvest is paste. Somer is done /
and we are yet miserable and unhappy. I am sorry for thaffliccion of the
daughter my people / I am fallen into a swone. Is there no rosyne medicinable or
triakle left in Galaad? There is no physician there that may restore the
daughter my people to her health.

The.ix. Chapter.
UVho may minister water to my head / and plentuouse tears to my eyes / to
weep day and night for the murder of the daughter my people? Who will give me
some strange solytary cotage in the deserte / that I might (my people forsaken)
go from them? For they be al aduouterers and the church of bakslyders.

They bend their tongues like a bow to shoteforth lies: but for the truth /
they may do nothing in the world. For they proceed from one mischefe to a
another and they hold not upon me / says the Lord. Every man must be ware of
oother / and no brother may trust a another: for brother supplanteth brother /
and neghbour deceaueth neghbour. Every man mocketh his neghbour / and the
trowthe they speak not. They have accustomed their tongues to lie and take great
pains to do mischefe. Thou haste set thy stole in the mids of desaight / and
for to deceive men / they forsook my knowledge says the lord. Wherefore thus
says the lord of powers. Behold I shall sees them out / I shall melte and
try the^. For what else should I do to my people?

Their tongues like sharp arowes pearse with desaight. With their lips they
speak peace with their neghbour / but pr^^ely they set snares for him. Must I
not then viset them for th^se thingis / says the Lord? Or should my mynd^
judge that nation innocent (who so ever they be) that is like unto this? Upon
the mountains therefore shall I take me to weping and moorning. And upon the
fayer playnes of the desert shall I begin to lament^ that they be thus brent up
/ that noman pass through them / that their is not herd one word of any
possessour / and that the birds of the air with the beasts ar carried and gone
fro thence. And even very Jerusalem shall I bring into an heap of stones and
dragons de^nes. And the cytes of Juda shall I make desolate without any
inhabitour. What mortal man is sowyse as to understand these thingis? or to
whom has the lord told forth these by mouth? sayng: Wherefore perisshest o
land? wherefore art thou so brentvp and made like a deserte / that noma^ may
pass through the? Eue^ the lord therefore him self told it them that forsook
his law which he gave them / and yet they received it not / nor lived aftir
it: but followed the craftynes of their own shrewed hartis and went aftir
gods as their fathers taught them. Wherefore even thus (I tell you) says the
Lord of powers the God of Israel. Behold I shall feed this people with anxt /
and give them gall to drink: I shall scater them into among the nations / whom
nether they nor their fathers know. I shall send the sword among them
persecuting until I have consumed them. Also thus said the Lord of powers. Se
that ye call mourners and send for the wise women to come spedely that they
might singe our moorninge songs / that the tears might fall from our eyes /
and water our chekis. For the lamentable voice of Zion apereth yet still / even
thus to be hard. How ar we destroyed? How miserably ar we confounded? we must
forsake our own contrye / for our own tabernacles cast us forth. But yet
hear the word of the lord / o ye women / and let your ears hear the word
of his mouth / that ye might teach your daughters / and each of them their
neghbours this lamentable moorning. Death is clymen in at our windows and has
pearsed through our houses destroying our childerne before our doors and our
young ons in the streates. But tell thou them / that thus says the lord.
Mennis carkases shall fall like donge upon the face of the field / and like
grass aftyr the sithe / noma^ to gather them up. And tell the^ that he says
thus to. Let not the wise glory in his own wisdom / nor the great man in
his power / nether the rich in his riches. But he that will glory / let him
glory in this / that he has understanding and knowleg of me / me. For it is I
that am the Lord / which do mercy / equity and righteousness upon therthe.
Wherefore in these thi^gis I delight chefely says the Lord. Behold the time
shall come says the Lord / that I will viset every circuncised nation: as the
Egypcion / the Iwe / the Idumey / Ammonites / Moabites / and the shaven
Madianitis which dwell in the deserte. For all the gentyles have their
foreskynne vncircuncised / but all the horse of Israel have their hartis
vncircuncised.

The.x. Chapter.
HEre the sermon of the Lord which he sends unto you oh house of Israel /
sayng thus. Be not learned aftir the ways of the gentyles / nether fear ye at
the signs of the sky or heaven which the gentyles fear. For the rytes and
laws of the gentyles ar very vanite. They will go cut down a tree from the
wode and fasshion it with the handis and axe of the artificer / than is it
made gaye with gold or silver / and fastened with hamers and naylis that it
move not nor go not a way. It stands as stiff as the palm tree / it speaks
not / it gothe not / but is borne only. Be not a frayd of siche thingis: for
they may do nether good nor harm. But unto the (oh Lord) none is like / thou
ar great / and great is the name of thy power. (...).
Who ought not to fear the? Or what king among al nations ought not to obaye
the? For among all the wise of the gentyles / and in all their kingdoms / none
is like the. They are al a like / unlearned and unwise. All their craft and
coning is but vanite. Silver is brought hither from Tharsis / and beten forth
into thin plates. And gold is brought from Ophir and beaten into the work
of the craft man by the hand of the caster and cled with byse and purple.
Siche is the work of al their wittye men together. But the Lord is the very
God / the living God and king everlasting. He being angrye the earth
tre^bleth: his indignacion no people may bear. But as touching these Idols
thus shall ye report by them. They are gods which made nether heaven nor
earth. They shall perisshe therefore as well from therthe as from these thingis
which are under this sky. But as concerning this our God / ye shall say. He
has made the earth by his power / and finesshed the rownde world by his
wisdom / and stretched forth the heuens by his understanding / at his voice
miche water runs together in the air / clouds ar lyfted up from the
extreme parts of therthe. Psalm. cxxxv^
He turns thonder into rain / and ledeth forth the wyndes out of their
secret places. Every man is made a fool of his own wisdom. Every man may be
ashamed that casts an image. For it is but a vain thing that he so melts
and blows together / and clean without life. These vain craftismen with
their workis worthy to be skorned so fondely framed and ornowernde / shall
perisshe al to gither in the time of their visitacio^. Siche is not Jacobs lot
/ but it is he that has fasshioned al things. And Israel is the met rod of
his heretage / whose name is the lord of powers. Take away a non fro my sight
thy filthenes which yet sit in so strong holds. For thus says the Lord.
Behold I shall castoute thinhabitours of this land / al at this time / and so
vex them that they no more appear. Ah less / how greuouse is my affliccion?
how sorrowful is my plage? For I bear this heuines and reke^ it as my nowne. My
tabernacle is destroyed and al my lines broken in sondre. My childerne ar gone
fro me / and appear no more. Now is there noma^ to bend my tente / or rear up my
skins. For full folesshly have the herdemen done in that they sought not the
lord: whereupon al their flocks also have done unwisely and be scatred away.
Lo the rumor of the host is present / and a great uproar comes from the
north to turn the cytes of Juda into a wilderness and into dens for dragons.
I know verily (Lord) that it lies not in mannis power to direct and rule his
own ways / nor yet to make perfect his own steapes and his goinge. Thou
therefore (Lord) shall amend us in equity / and not in thy wrath: lest thou
bring us unto naught. Power forth rather thy wrath upon the haithen that know
the not / and upon the generacions that call not upon thy name / and that namely
for this cause / that they have eatenvp / devoured / and consumed Jacob / and
extincte his brightness.

The.xi. Chapter.
Another sermon which the Lord stered up Jeremy to preach / sayng.
HEar ye the wordis of this his covenant / and speak unto al Juda and to
thinhabitours of Jerusalem. But thou namely shall say unto them. Thus says
the Lord God of Israel: Cursed be every man that obaye not the wordis of this
covenant which I commanded your fathers what time I led them out of the land
of Egypt from that hard furnace and greuouse seruitute / sayng: Obaye my
voice / and do aftyr that I command you / and ye shall be my people and I shall
be your God / and keep mine holy oath which I swore to your fathers / to give
the^ this land flowing with milk and honey / as ye may se it fulfilled unto
this day. Here I answerde sayng: Oh Lord it is trwe. And then ye Lord said
to me again. Preach thou al these wordis in ye cites of Juda and ro^^^e about
Jerusalem / sayng: Hear the wordis of ye covenant yt ye might fulfill the^.
For I certified your fathers / openly testifyi^g unto the^ from yt time sense I
brought the^ out of the land of Egypt unto this day warni^g the^ intyme
sai^g. Lyste^ to my voice: and noman listened nor gave ear / but followed ye
crooked thoughtis of their own hertis. Wherefore I brought al ye words of this
covenant upon the^ which I gave the^ to fulfill and they fulfilled it not. Over
this the lord yet said to me. There is fou^doute a co^iuracio^ in all Juda and
in the cytesens of Jerusalem. They are returned unto the sins of their fore
fathers which forsook to hear my wordis. And eue^ so do these men follow
strange goddis to worship the^. The house of Israel and Juda has made void my
covenant which I smit with their fathers. Wherefore thus says the Lord.
Behold I shall bring forth a plage upon you / from which ye may no ways
escape. ye and wha^ ye shall cry to me / yet will I not hear you. The^ shall the
cytes of Juda with the cytesens of Jerusale^ go and cry upon their goddis who^
they worshipped / but in no manner wise may they help the^ in time of their
miserable adfliccion. For look how many cytes / so many gods had thou oh Juda
/ and acording to the nowmber of the streatis of Jerusalem / thou settedst up
shameful auters / auters upon whom thou bre^st thy offeringis eue^ unto Baal.
Thou therefore pray not for this people / nether bid praise nor prayer for the^.
For when thou shall cry to me I shall not hear them in their affliccio^. Wherefore
(oh my best beloved Israel) co^mittest thou in my house so many sins? as
though the holy their beasts sacrificed and of fred up is called holy flesh.
flesh might take away thy sins namely which haste so roioysed in thy
nowne my schefe. The lord named the / that goodly grene floureshing fruteful
and fayer olyne: but now / the contrary fame wide spread / he will burn the in
the fire and destroy thy branches. For the lord of powrs which planted ye
has ordined a plage for the (oh house of Israel and house of Juda) for the
euel that ye have done provoking him to wrath with the worship done to Baal.
These things oh lord (thou teaching me) I understood / when thou shewedst me
their counsels: but I like a meke lombe was appointed to be slain / knowing
nothing that they had taken their counsel thus agenst me: saying let us corrupt
his bread on the tree / and so banysshe him from the company of the living that
even the very mention of his name might be odiouse and loothsome.

Thou therefore / lord of powrs / rightuouse judge sercher out of raynes and
hertis: I beseech the that I might se ve^gea^ce taken on them. For unto the I
commit my cause. As concerning these things / thus spoke the lord upon the
cytesens of Anathot which sought to make an end of me / sayng: Preach to us
no more in the name of the lord / except thou will dye in our handis. Thus (I
say) spoke the lord of powrs. Behold / I shall viset you / your young men
shall be slain with sword: and your sons and daughters shall dye for honger /
so that none be left. For I shall bring a plage upon the citesens of Anathot /
and the day of their visitacio^.

The.xii. Chapter.
But thou Lord art to rightuouse for me to reason with. Not withstanding yet I
would talk with the of rightwisenes. or of thy deep iugements.
How is it that the way of the ungodly so prospers and al vnshamefaced
sinners live in siche pleasure? Thou art ready at their mouths what so ever
they ask / although thou be full far from their hertis. But thou Lord / unto
whom I am known and perfitly seen / which also have serched out my heart /
doist thou not favor them to bring them in together like fed ware apoi^ted to
the bochers stal consecrated unto the day of slaughter? How long shall this
land wayle and all the grass of the field be withred up for the malice of her
inhabitours? Beast and foul ar gone / while these men yet say. God thinks
not to make an end of us. And they obbrayded me sayng wha^ thou ra^nest but
with footme^ / thou wast tired / and will thou than strive to run with horse?
Thou waste not suer in thy nowne peaceable country: how will thou the^ look to
endure in the proud ruffeling of Jordane? For even thy nowne brethren and thy
fathers familye altogether ho^ted the forth following the with ^n out cry* For
thou woldst not believe them even when they told the for the best. Whom I
answerde thus. I left my house in deed and gave over my heretage / and put my
life (which nothing is to me more dear) into the handis of my enymes / for my
heretage was made to me as a lyo^ in the wode: It barked agenste me: wherefore I
hate it. My heretage is to me as a painted b^^de / but a gredy flock of fowls
houered over it round about. Go your ways and begathred together also ye
beastis of the field / and haste you to denoure it. The multitude of herdemen
have destroyed my vyneyarde / they have trodden down my heretage / even my
most pleasant heretage have they brought into a desolate deserte and wasted
it / which now wasted moorneth upon me / ye althe hole land is destroyde / and
noman petyeth it or set it at heart. There shall come destroyers through althe
ways of the field: for the sword of the Lord shall devour this land from
one end to the other / and nothing living shall have rest. Men shall sow whete /
and reap thorns: they shall take fermes / but al in vain: for ye shall be
ashamed of your profit for the wrath and indignacion of the Lord. Also thus
said the Lord upon al my neghbours which molested and laid hands upon
theretage which I gave to Israel my people. I shall verily swepe them forth /
even Israel shall I cast out of their land / and the house of Juda shall I
carye away to. But aftir that I have plucked them up by the rotes / I shall
favor them and be merciful unto them / and bring them agene every man to his
own heretage and to his own country. Also / it shall come thus to pass /
that if the destroyers of my people will be enstructe and taught the ways of my
people to swear be my name. The Lord fyueth. As they taught my people to swear
be Baal / they shall be grieffed into among my people. But if they will not obaye /
I shall cast out sich manner of folk and destroy them / says the Lord.

The.xiii. Chapter
ALso thus says the Lord unto me.

Go and bye the a broad synen girdle: and girde it about they raynes / but let
it not come in any water. Than I got me this girdle as the Lord bad me and
put it about my raynes. Aftyr this / the Lord spoke to me agene. Take the
girdle which thou haste bought the / and put it about thy loins / and rise /
and go thy way to Euphrates and hyde it there in an hole of the rok. Then I
went and hid it as the Lord commanded me. And it happened that long aftir
this / the lord said unto me. Arise and haste the to Euphrates / and take out
thy girdle which I commanded to be there hid. The^ I went forth to Euphrates /
and dug out my girdle / and took it away from the place where I-hid it.
And lo the girdle was rote^ / so that it would serve to no use. Then spoke the
Lord to me these wordis. Thus says the lord. Eue^ aftir this manner fhal I
destroy the pride and gloriouse fame of Juda and Jerusalem with sword. This
people is fulcursed and maliciouse. They wilnot hear my wordis / they follow the
counsels of their own hertes and the strange gods whom of they worshipped and
fildowne before them: wherefore they shall be like this girdle which is profitable
for nothing. For even as the girdle cleueth to a mannis raynes / so had I glued
to me all the house of Israel and all the house of Juda says the Lord / to be
my people to have a great name / to be honorable and clear / but they obeyed
me not. Thou shall tell them therefore this ridel. Thus says the lord God of
Israel. Every wine pot is filled with wine. Here shall they anon answer. Can
we not know this / that every wine pot may be filled with wine? Than shall
thou tell them. Thus says the lord. Behold I shall fill al thinhabitours of
this land and eue^ the kings that sit in the seat of David / Priests and
Prophets to / and all the citesens of Jerusalem with dronkenes / and thruste
them down to gyther / one neghbour upon a another / and the fathers upon their
childerne al upon an heap says the Lord. I will not forgive nor spare / nor
have mercy / to thentente I would destroy them. Obaye / give ear / and be not
proud / for it is the Lord that speaks. Give ye therefore glory to your
lord God before he withdraw his light / and ere your fete stomble in derkenes
at the hill. For than if ye look for light he shall turn it into deadly
derkenes. And if ye wilnot here this secret monition / Or this prophecy
my heart shall weep with in me for your stobourne pride / I shall lament
grievously / tears shall drope down fro my eyes / for the flock of the Lord
shall be led away captyue. Tell the king the queen and the chief rulers sayng:
Homble your selves and sit down: for the crown of your beutye shall fall from
your headis. The southe cites shall be shutvp and taken / and noma^ shall open
the^. Al Juda shall be led away captive so that none be left. Lyftevp your eyes
and behold who comes from the north. They shall come upon the like a wealy
drove of beasts. Unto who^ then (I pray the) shall thou make they moan wha^
they shall thus fall upon the? For they are of thy nowne teaching into they nowne
utter destruction. Shall not panges come than upon ye as on a woman traueling of
child? And if thou think with thy self / wherefore come these upon me? For
thy many fold sins (I tell the) thy narse shall be showed and thy bare thighs
shall be seen. For even as the Morin may change his skin and the Leoparde his
spots / so may you once accustomed and stained with sin do good. I shall
therefore disperse you like stubble tossed with the southe wind. This shall be
thy lotte and thus shall I mesure the / says ye Lord. In asmoche as ye have
forgote^ me and trusted in deceauable thingis / I shall turn thy clothes over
thy head: and show thy bare thighs / and thy preuye parts: thy adultery /
thy wa^tone neainge / and crime of fornicacio^ shall be showed. For I have seen
thy abominacions in feldes and hills. Wobe to ye Jerusalem: for there is no
hope aftyr this that ever thou will be made clean.

The.xiiii. Chapter.
The word of the Lord showed unto Jeremye upon the famyn / drought / and
dearth.

IVda shall moorn and her gates shall be no more haunted. The land shall be neglect
/ and the kryi^gout of Jerusalem shall fleforthe. The Masters shall send their
servants to fetch water / which wha^ they shall come to ye pittes / shall find
no water. But carry agene their vessels emptye. They shamed and confounded /
shall kouer their headis: for ye earth shall be roughe and hard / for that no
rain falls upon it. Also it shall yrke ye ploughmen which also shall kouer
their headis. The hynde fawni^g in ye field / shall leave her fawn behind her
for lak of grass. The wild asses shall stand in open out places drawing in
ye wind or gapi^g for wynd^
like drago^s / their eyes shro^ke^ into their headis for lak of grass. Verily
our wykednes is welworthy this plage. But thou Lord yet deal with us according
to thy name / al though our bakslyd ingis and sins be full great and many
fold: for it is thou which art so looked and waited for: it is thou yt art ye
health and savior of Israel i^ time of tribulacio^. Wherefore shuldst thou become
a stranger in this land and lyk a way fayrer to turnyn and tarry but a night?
Wherefore shall thou be as amassed man so benoumed for all his strength / that he
cannot save us? Lord thou art ours / and we are called aftyr thy name / forsake
us not then. Here spoke the Lord as concerning this people whose fete never
ceased / but delighted ever more to wander hither and thither with the lordis
so high displesure / that he would now call to mind their wikednes and viset
their sins: thus (I say) said the Lord to me. Desyer nothing yt good is for
this people: For albeit they their selves fast / yet shall I not hear their
prayers. If they offer bre^t sacrifices and slaye any other oblacion for me /
yet will I not accept the^. For I will waste them up with sword honger and
pestelence. The^ answerde I unto these words. Ah Lord God / behold / the
Prophetis tell them / ye shall not se the sword / ye shall not suffer honger /
but very peace and prosperity doutelesse shall the Lord give you in this place.
Then said the Lord to me. These Prophetis prophecye them lies in my name. I
never commanded the^ I spoke not to them / I never sent the^: and yet they
prophecye false visions / blind prophecyes and vain desaightis inverted of
their own hertis. Wherefore thus says the Lord upon these Prophetis that thus
prophecye in my name / and yet ar they not sent of me / affirming nether
sword nor ho^ger to come upon this land. Siche Prophets shall be consumed with
sword and honger. And this people unto whom they preach / shall be cast out of
Jerusalem / slain with sword and honger / no man to bury the^: nether shall
they only suffer this / but their wives / sons / and daughters to. For I
shall powerforth their own mischefe agene upon them. And even thus shall thou
say to them: I shall weep day and night never ceasing because the daughter of
my people shall be destroyed with greuouse adfliccion and made anende of with so
great a plage. For go I forth into the field: lo / al shall be kouerd with the
slain with sword: enter I into the cite / I shall se al storuen for honger.
But both Prophetis and Priestis shall be led a way into unknown regions. Have
thou then (said I) utterly cast a way Juda / and aborrest thou Zion? Or have
thou smiten us with out a cause / so that there be left in us no hope of health
/ loking for peace while no good comes / and for the time of cure / and lo
there comes trouble more and more? no verily. For we (Lord) knolege our
ungodliness / and the wykednes of our fathers with which we have offended the.
Be thou not angrye for thy names sake: Fall not from thy mercy / forget not thy
goodness / remember the seat of thy glory / and break not covenant made with
us. Arther any among the goddis of the gentyles yt can rain? Or do the
clouds give us showers? But is it not thou rather Lord our God / in whom we
trust? It is thou verily which doist al these things.

The.xv. Chapter.
ANd here the Lord interrupted my prayer sayng. If Moses and Samuel should
stand before me entreating / yet would I not bepeased or at one with this
people. Cast the^ out of my sight that they were once gone. And if they ask
ye whother shall we go? tell the^: thus says ye Lord: Some to ye sword / some
to ho^ger / some into captivity. For I shall send among the^ four kind of
plages says ye Lord: the sword to slaye the^ / dogs to tear the^ in peses
/ fowls of thaier / and beastis of therthe to devour and destroy the^ / and
I shall make the^ to be vexed and evil entreated of al ye kingdoms of therthe /
and yt namely for Manasses ye son of Ezechias king of Juda / eue^ for these
thingis which he committed in Jerusalem. Who the^ shall pytye the oh
Jerusalem? who shall lame^te ye? or who shall make intercession to purchase thy
peace when thou shall be fallen fro me and slyden back says the Lord? I
shall therefore streche forth my hand agenste the and destroyethe. It shall
grieve me to spare the. I shall wenowe ye into the vttermoste parts of therthe.
I shall waste and destroy my people because they would not return from their
own ways. I shall increase me their wedowes above the sandis of ye sea. I shall
suerly bring destroyers upon the mothers of their young childerne eue^ at none
days. I shall smite them down suddenly with enymye and fear. She shall be
chyldelesse that was fruteful / she shall be sorrowful and counfortles. The son
shall fail her eue^ at ye midde day / she being ashamed and sonken away for
thought and heaviness. The rest of the^ I shall through agenste their enymes sword
/ says ye Lord. Ah less that ever thou my mother conceyuedst me / a man
borne to be agaynsayd contraryed and chyde^ with of al men. Which although I
another lend nor borowe / yet am I spoken evil by of al men. And ye Lord
answerde me. Is it not I yt direct the for ye best? do not I help ye in time
of tribulacio^? Wha^ thou art in trouble even among thy utter enimes? Does
yern hurt yerne: or stele brought from the north? But your substance and
tresure / shall I give into their proye: not for any price: but for all your
sins which ye have committed in all your costs. And I shall translate you with
your enimye into a land which ye know not: For ye fire which is kindled with
my wrath shall burn you up. Than begane I agene to entreat / sayng: Thou Lord
know clearly al thingis / remember me and defend me: deliver me fro my
persuers: let thy mercy preuente thy wrath. For thou know that for thy sake
I suffer this opprobrye. I fill upon they words and de^owred the^: they were
joy and gladness unto my heart. For it is thy name Lord God of powrs that I
call upon. I am not co^uersant with scorners to deryde and to make a gaudye: but
I dwell alone under the fere of thy hand / for thou haste filled me with
bitterness. Shall my heaviness last ever? and my incurable wound shall it never be
healed? Will thou toss me here and there like unstable and violent waters?
Unto this my co^playnt the Lord answerde. If thou turnest ageyn I shall restore
the to my service. And when thou shall deuyde the preciouse from the vile /
thou shall be as my nowne mouth. They shall be turned to the / but beware thou
turnest not away fro me unto them. For I shall set the agenste this people like
a strong brason wall. They shall fight therefore agenst the / but they shall not
win the.

For I will be with the to save and deliver the says the Lord. For I shall
deliver the from the hand of the most myscheuouse and take the out of cruel
handis.

The.xvi. Chapter.
THe word of the Lord was given me on this manner saing. Take no wife nor
bringeforth no chyldern in this place. For thus says the Lord upon the
childerne borne in this place and upon the motherne that bring them forth and
fathers that begete the^ in this land. They shall dye a full bitter and paynful
death. They shall not be moorned for / nor buried / but lie still upon
donghillis on therte. They shall be consumed with sword and ho^ger / and their
carions shall be meat for the fowls of the air and beastis of the earth. Also
thus spoke the Lord. Come not at their comen festis or at their comen
moorningis and lamentacions. For I have taken away my peace from this people
says the Lord / ye both my favor and mercy. And both old and young shall
dye in this land and not be buryd: there shall noman clippe or shave his head
for them. They shall not viseteche other in time of moorning to cou^fort the^
for ye dead / another drink with each other of ye cup of consolacio^ to take
away the heuines for their father and mother. Come not in their feste houses
to sitdown with them at meat and drink. For thus says ye Lord of powrs / ye
God of Israel. Lo I shall take from this place (your selves loking on and
living) ye voice of joy and mirth / the voice of brydegrome and spouse.
Wherefore when thou shall show this people al these wordis / and they shall ask
the agene: wherefore has the Lord decreed all these great mischeues to fall
upon us? or what is our wykednes and sin that we committed agenst our Lord
God? Thou shall answer: Because your fathers have forsaken me (says the Lord)
and followed strange gods whom they worshipped and fill down before / forsaking
me and keeping not my law. And you have excedid thungodlynes of your fathers in
your own sins: For every one of you follow the deuellishe thoughtis of his
own shrewd heart and obayeth me nothing at all. Wherefore I shall cast you out
of this land into a land unknown both to you and your fathers: and there
shall ye serve strange gods day and night: where I shall have no compassion upon
you. Wherefore / behold / the days ar come says the Lord / that it shall no
more be said. The Lord lives that brought the chyldern of Israel out of the
land of Egypt: but it shall be said / the Lord lyuethe which has brought the
chyldern of Israel out of the north east land / and from every region
whother I casted them forth. For I shall bring them agene unto their own land
which I gave their fathers. Behold I shall send them many fysshers / says the
Lord / which shall ketche them up: and aftir that I shall send many honters to
honte them out of every mountain and hill / and also forth of every hole in
the rocks. For my eyes ar bente upon all their ways / and they cannot be
hid fro my face / nor their sins kouerd fro my sight. ye and that aftir I
have fully rewarded the^ for their iniquytes and sins wherewith they have
defiled my land / that is to say / for their abominable stinki^g Idols
wherewith they replenesshed my heretage. Oh Lord my strength / my might / and
my refuge in time of tribulacion / yet shall ye ge^tylis come to ye from ye
costs of ye earth sayng. Suerly our fathers cleued to lies / full vain ar
Idols / and no profit is there in them. For should a man make him goddis of the^
who^ it is impossible to be goddis? Wherefore / se I shall teach them now again
says the Lord: and make my power and strength known unto the^ / so that they
shall know that my name is the Lord.
Jehouah.

The.xvii. Chapter.
YOur syn (o trybe of Juda) must be written with a pe^ne of yerne / and graven
in with an Adamantyne klaye into ye table of your heart / and into the corners
of your alters / that your chylderne should remembyr your alters / wodis / and
thick trees / hill tops / mountayns and feldis. Wherefore I shall layeforthe
al your substance and tresure to be a proye for your open crimes committed in
hillis at images who^ ye worshipped thorowt all your regio^. And ye shall also be
blotted out of your heretage which I gave you. And I shall cast you under the
bondage of your enymes in an unknown land: for ye have put fire unto my furye
which shall burn evermore. These thing is says the Lord: Cursed be the man
that trusts in man / and makes man his arm / whose heart gothe from the
Lord. For he shall be like the fearne that grows in the deserte / never to se
the goodness to come / but shall abide upon the dry deserte / even the salt
barayn grownde inhabitable. But blessed is the man that trusts in the Lord /
whose hope is the Lord. Psalm. i
For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters putti^g down her roots to
draw up moystenes: which tree may abide the heat when it comes / and shall
flowresshe with grene leaves: and when the drowght shall dryvp and waste al
other fruits / yet this tree shall not fade nor cease from bringing forth her
fruit.

Of al thingis lyuinge / man has the most disceaightful heart unable to be
serehed: who then shall know it? even I the lord both ensercher of heart and
espyerout of raynes to reward every man aftir his own ways and according to
the fruit of his counsellis. He makes him a neste / but hatcheth no eggis that
gatherth goodis wrongefully. In the middis of his life he must leave them /
and last of all be fownde a fool. But thou Lord / whole seat is most
noblest / highest and aunciaunt: which dwell in the place of our holy rest
/ thou art the hope of Israel. All that forsake the / ar confounded. All
bakflyders from the / ar written in the earth and not in heaven. For they sorsake
the Lord / even ye well of everlasting waters. Heal me Lord / and I shall be
holl. Save me Lord / and I shall be salfe: for thou art my praise. For lo /
these men say unto me. Where is the word of ye Lord? let it comeforth (I
pray ye) Whiles I me self was now leading the flok in thy paths / I
constrained noman violently / nor yet coueted I any mannis death as thou well
know. But my words were right in thy sight oh lord. Be not fearful unto me
/ for thou art he in who^ I hope wha^ any perelis present. Let my persuers be
confounded / and let not me be confounded. Let the^ be afraid and not me be
afraid. Thou shall bring a troublouse time upon the^ / and destroy the^ with
a great destruccio^. Forthermore / thus said the Lord unto me. Go and stand
in ye. gate of ye people / for whose cause ye kings of Juda come in and out /
and in all ye gatis of Jerusalem / sayng unto the^. Hear ye word of the Lord
ye kings of Juda / with all Juda and all the cytesens of Jerusalem which pass
through these gatis. Thus commands the Lord. Take heed to your selves lest
ye take up your burdens in ye Sabbat day / to bring them in through these
gatis. Nether karye ye out of your houses any burde^s in ye Sabbat day. Nor
do you any work / but sauntifye ye Sabbat day as I commanded your fathers
albeit they obayed me not nor gave ear: but rather hardened their stiff
necks to thentent they would not be reclaymed and receive my disciplyne. But
you / if ye will hearme (says ye Lord) and not carye in your burdens through
ye gatis of this cite in ye Sabbat day doing in it no work / than shall ye
kingis and princes of this cite / which shall sit upon ye seat of David / go
through these gatis karyed in charietis and upon horse / both they and their
princes / and al Juda with their cytesens shall pass through them / and this
cite shall abide for ever. And men shall come from the cytes of Juda / and from
the field of Jerusalem / and the land of Benjamin from the playnes and
mountayns: and from the wilderness bringing burnt sacrifices and beastis slain
to be offered up / and encense / offeringe up praise and thankis in the house of
the Lord. But if ye obaye me not / I shall sanctifye the sabbat day / so that
ye shall take up no burden to bring it in through these gatis of Jerusalem in
the Sabbat day. I shall set the gatis on fire / which shall deuower the houses
of Jerusalem / so that it may not be (...).

The.xviii. Chapter.
THe sermon of the Lord showed unto Jeremye / saying: Arise and go down into
the potters house: that I might there certyfye the more of my mind. And wha^ I
came unto the potters house: I fownde him making his work upon a whele. And
that vessel which he ofayned out of claye broke under ye ha^dis of this potter:
which then (his mind changed) made a another vessel thereof as it seemed him
best for his purpose. And here tha^ the Lord spoke unto me. May not Jeuen as
this potter / do unto you (o house of Israel) says the Lord? Lo / ye be in my
hand oh house of Israel / even as the claye is in the hand of the potter.
Anon as I have determined to pluck up by the rotes / to destroy and to cut
away any nation or kingdom / and if yt same nation will return from their
malice / upon which I begane now to take my counsel: by and by it repents me
of ye plage which I determined to cast upon the^. And again / and as I am
purposed to build and to plant any nation or kingdom: and the same folk will
do evil in my sight / and not hear my voice / by and by it repe^teth me of that
goodness whereby I purposed to edyfye and to encrese the^. Wherefore (I pray the)
tell all Juda and every cytesen of Jerusalem. Thus says the Lord. Behold I
am deuysing a plage and will conspire agenste you: Turn ye therefore every man
from his own evil ways / and both do and think well. But here shall they
say* Let these wordis pass / for as for us / we will walk aftir our own
mind / and we will every man do aftir the lust of our own heart. Wherefore
thus said the Lord. Inquire (I pray ye) among the gentyles if any man has
committed any siche like abominacions as has Israel ye virgen done / and that
so grievously. May the snow that lies melting upon ye rockis of Libanus fail
the feldis? Or the veins of springes eue^ from the botome be so taken away
that they flow no more forth to water and to make plentuouse? And yet my people
has forgoten me: In somich that they brenne and offer unto vain Idols: and in
following their own ways ar: fwarued and wandered from the lawful comen way:
and ar gone a way by an untrodden private pathe. For the which thing / they
have given up their land into a perpetual desolacio^ and outehissinge. So that
every man passinge through / may be woundresly astonned / and shake his head. I
shall therefore scater them in the sight of their enymes with a contrary
skorching este wind. And when their destruction is at hand / I shall turn my
back to them / and not my face. And than they said: Come and let us go and
conspire agenste Jeremye. We be the Priestis to whom the law is committed that
it perisshe not.

And ye be the elders endewed with wisdom. We be the Prophets that never ar
without the word of the Lord. Let us (I say) than go and kutoute his tongue
/ that we be no more constrained to hear his sermons. Attend unto me (Oh Lord)
and hear the noise of my aduersares. Is not evil for good reqcquyted me while
they dig this pit for me? Remember how. I stood before the to speak the
best for them / and to turn thy wrath from the^. Now therefore betake their
chyldern into honger / and cast them agenste the violence of sword. Let their
wives be chyldelesse and housbandlesse / their housbandis put to death / and
the yongemen slain with sword in battle. Let out cries arise from their
houses / thieves breaking in upon them unawares: For they have dug a pit to
take me / and laid a preuey snare for my fete. But thou know all their
counsel bente to slaye me. Be not therefore merciful to their myschief / nether
suffer thou their sins to be puttoute of thy sight: but let them fall gyltye
conuicte before the. These thingis shall thou do to them in time of thy
furiouse indignacion.

The.xix. Chapter.
ALso thus said the Lord to Jeremye. Go and bye the an erthen pitsherde: and
bring forth the elders of the people and of the Priestis into the vale of
Tophet Gehena al one.
Ben hinnon which is without the gate where all the potsherdis be scatered And
preach me there these sermons which I shall tell the. Thus (I say) thou shall
preach. Hear the word of the Lord ye rulers of Juda and cytesens of
Jerusalem. These thingis commands the Lord of powers ye God of Israel.
Behold I shall bring a scourge and affliccion upon this place: which who
soever hears / a non his ears shall glowe: and that eue^ because they have
forsaken me / and defiled this place offering their burnt sacrifices unto
strange goddis: who^ another they theirselues / nor their fathers know / nor
yet the kings of Juda. And have filled this place with the blood of
innocentis. For they bylte Baal an auter to burn their childerne into
asacrifice for Baal. Which thing as for me / I never commanded nor spoke of /
nor never thought it. Wherefore / behold / the time shall come (says the Lord)
that this place be no more called Thopheth or vale of Be^hinnon / but the vale
of slaughter. For I shall slaye the senators of Juda and Jerusalem in this
place and smite the^ down with sword in the sight of their emnes which seek
their life. And I shall give their cario^s meat to the fowls of the aier and
bestis of the earth. Also I shall make this cite desolate and hilled at: so that
every man that passes by it / may be a stonned and hysse upon her great plage.
And I shall cause them to eat their own chylders flesh: ye / and one shall
eat a another in the besege and distress wheryn their emnes with sich as seek
their lives shall hold the^ hard / and thou shall al to break this pitsherd
before these men which shall be there present with the / sayng unto them. Thus
says the Lord of powers. Eue^ thus shall I alto break and destroy this people
and cite / like as a potter breketh a vessel which can never more be repayrede.
And in Thopheth shall they be buried / because they have no another place to
burye them in. Also thus shall I do to this place and to the inhabitours thereof
says the Lord / for I shall make the cite like Thophet. For the houses of
Jerusalem / and the houses of the kings of Juda ar polluted eue^ as is this
place Thophet / because that all the houses in whose parlers they burned
incense unto all the companey of the stars and planetis were pollated / and
they with out any stop offered unto strange goddis. Aftir this / Jeremye came
from Thophet whither the Lord had sent him to prophecye and preche: and stood
in the fore court of the temple sayng unto all the people. Thus says the Lord
of powers ye God of Israel. Behold I shall bring upon this cite / and upon al
her tow^es about / every plage which I have decreed to fall upon it: be cause
they have so hardened their proud necks / yt they would not obaye my monicio^s

The.xx. Chapter.
THan Pashur the Priest / sone of Immery / ouermost in the house of ye Lord:
when he herd Jeremy so constantly preching these thingis: he smitte Jeremy the
Prophet / and cast him bownde into ye stocks yt stood in the over gate of
Benjamin which was in ye house of the Lord. And ye day following Pashur
brought forth Jeremye out of the stockis. And Jeremy said unto him. The Lord
shall no no more callthy name Pas^ur / is craf^ glori^use up ^ym^^er. Pa^^ur / is
^^ne shri^^ige in (...) a kor^^er for ^^are
Pashur / but Magur every where. For thus says the Lord: Behold I shall make
the fearful / both to thy nowne self / and also to al thy fre^dis which shall
fall under ye sword of their enmes before thy face. And I shall give up al Juda
into the power of the king of Babylon / which shall kary a way captyue to
Babylon part of the^: and part shall he slaye with sword. Also likewise shall
I give up all the riches of this cite: all the noble acts and victoriouse
labors / all the preciouse iwells and tresure of the kingis of Juda into the
handis of their enymes / which shall both rob the^ and kary the^ captive to
Babylon. And eue^ thou Pashur with all thy household shall be ledawaye captive
to Babylon: and there shall thou dye and be buried / both thou and all that set
any thing by the / unto whom thou prechedst lies. Lord thou brekest me / but
thou cou^fortest me agene and make me strong. I am iested upon and skorned
every day of every man / because that now I have preached a long time /
inueinge agenst their wyked violence and tyranye / crying into their ears this
desolacion. Whereupon they obrayded me of the word of the Lord / and turned it
into my perpetual derision. Wherefore I thought many times / never more to mind
it / nor to preach in thy name. But yet the word wrought in my heart and in
my bones like a kindled fire closed in / which when I labored to repress / it
passed my power / ye although yet I herd the heinous rebukis of many and
suffered unjust vexacions even of my nowne singler acquaintance / evermore
ready to fear me saying: Let him be taken / broughtforth / accused and trapped:
so that if thus parauenture (he cooled and broken) and we seming to prevail
agenst him / might be avenged on him. But the Lord stood by me like a valeau^t
knygh / which fighting for me / my persuers fill away having no power over me.
They were shamefully confounded for that they dealt folishly: whereupon they
fill into perpetual obprobrye. Thou therefore Lord of powers / the just tryer
and sercheroute of the truth / unto whom heart and raynes are not hid: let me
se vengeance taken on them: for unto the I commit my cause. Singe ye to the
Lord and praise him: for he has delivered the life of the poor from the
cruel hand of the violent. Cursed be the day yt I was borne in: the day that
my mother brought me forth be never more spokenof. Cursed be the man that
first brought glad tydingis to my father / sayng: Thou have a man child. The
same thing might chaunse to that man / which chanced once upon the cytes
(which ye Lord with out any stop subverted hearing their pestilent fame
with out cease) because I was not killed as soon as I was borne: Sodo^e and
Gomer.
or yt my mother was not made my grave / my concepcio^ holden back in her for
ever. Wherefore was I brought forth of my mothers womb? Verily / because I
should feel both labor and sorrow and so leadforth my life i^ obprobrye

The.xxi. Chapter.
THe sermon of the Lord showed unto Jeremye / when Zedechias sent unto him
pashur the sone of Melchie and Zephony the Priest / sone of Maasy with this
manner of commandment sayng: Ask counsel of the Lord (we pray the) as
touching us (for Nabuchadrezar king of Babylon laith sege unto us) whither god
paraduenture will do with us aftir his meruelouse power / and so turn this
king from us. Then Jeremy said unto them. Thus shall ye answer Zedechye. Thus
says the Lord God of Israel. Behold I shall wringe the weapens out of your
ha^dis / which ye hold to fight agenste the king of Babylon and the Chaldeis
fighting agenst you without at the wallis: and I shall bring your weape^s
altogether into the middis of this cite / and I my self shall fight agenste you
with a stretchedforth hand and strong arm / with indignacion furye and great
wrath / and shall smite the inhabitours of this cite / so that both man and
beast shall dye of a great pestilence. And aftir this / says the Lord / I shall
give up Zedechye king of Juda / both his seruauntis and the people / with the
resydew of this cite / who^ pestilence / sword / and honger have left / into
the power of Nabuchadrezar king of Babylon / into ye handis of their enmyes /
eue^ into ye ha^dis of the^ yt thirst for their life / which shall smite the^
with the edge of sword / without alco^passion / nether sparing / nor having
any mercy on them. And unto this people thou shall say. Thus says the Lord:
Behold I shall setforth before you the way of life and death. Whosoever ever
abides in this cite shall dye with sword or honger or pestelence: but he that
will goforthe to go to the Chaldes that besege you / shall save himself / and
his life shall be unto him like a lukkely gotten proye. For I have bente my face
age^ste this cite to scourge it / and not to do it good / says the Lord: that
it might be given up into the power of the king of Babylon to be brent. Also
thou shall say to the kings house of Juda. Hear the word of ye Lord ye
house of David for thus says the Lord: Ministre rightwisnes without any
delay and deliver the oppressed and spoiled from the power of the violent
vexer before my furye comeforthe like fire to burn / so that noma^ may
que^che it / for your mischeuous studyes. Behold me here at hand eue^ among
you which dwell here and there in wales in rocks / and playns says ye Lord /
which say who shall make us afraid? Or who can come to our holdis? But I shall
viset you acording to ye merits of your study says the Lord / and kindel a
fire thorowt your wodis to devour al thingis rownde about you.

The.xxii. Chapter.
FOrthermore thus spoke the Lord. Go thy ways down into ye kingis house of
Juda: and there speak this sermon saying: Hear the word of the Lord o king
of Juda which sit in ye seat of David. Hear (I say) both thou / thy
servants and people which iette so prowdely through these gatis. Thus commands
the Lord. Observe equite and righteousness / and avenge the spoiled from the
power of the wrong doer. The stranger / the fatherless / and wedewe / see
thou moleste not / hurt / nor rob: another shede ye innocent blood in this
place. And if ye observe these thingis constantly: the kingis which shall sit
in the seat of David / shall go through the gates of this house / and be carried
in charyets and upon horse / both they / their servants / and their people. But
if thou obseruest not these precepts: I swear by my nownselfe (says the Lord)
that this house shall be desolate. For even thus has the Lord spoken upon the
house of Juda. Thou art the head even as is Galaad in Libano: but if I bring
not the and thy cytes into a deserte / yt they be not inhabited. never trust
me. the form of his oath in ye scripture.
For I shall apoynte forth / and send into ye a destroyer with is weapens to
cutdowne thy chosen Cedres and cast the^ into ye fire. And wha^ any other
nacio^ shall pass forby this cite: one shall say to another: wherefore has ye
Lord done thus unto this great cite^ Tha^ it shall be answerde: eue^ because
they forsook and despised the covenant of their lord God / and fildowne and
worshipped strange goddis. Weep not for the dead / nor moorne yet not for him:
but weep sore for him now going a way: For this man shall never come ageyn /
nor yet se his own native land. For thus says the Lord upon Sellum
otherwise called Joachas now led captyuein to Egypt
the sone of Josias king of Juda reigning aftir Josias his father. He that is
goneforth of this regio^ / shall neuermore return. For he shall dye in the same
place / into which he is led captive and neuermore se this land. Woe be to
him yt buyldeth his house by iniurye and wrong and sets up his parlers and
chaumbers by fraud and violence / which makes his own neighbor to serve him
for naught / not geuinge him his reward for his labor. Thus thinks he with
himself. I will buyld me a large house and costely chau^bres. He cutteth him
forth windows / beams and grounsels of Cedre and paynteth them with read.
Think thou now to reign / when with thy cedre buyldingis thou prouokest me
to envy and to be aue^ged? Did not thy father in his trwe and just labor eat
and drink and prospered well? Whiles he avenged the cause of the poor
oppressed / he prospered well: which thing / whereof else sh^ld it hape^ / but
for ye knowledge of me / says the Lord? But thy eyes and thy heart ar al
together set upon covetousness / to spillinnoce^t blood / to do injury and
extorsion. Wherefore thus says the Lord upon Joakim sone of Josias king of
Juda. They shall not lament and mourn him with these wont lementable words.
Ah my brother / oh my sister / another with these / Ah Lord / oh noble king.
But he shall be buried like anasse / eue^ stinking cast with out the gatis of
Jerusalem. Clyme up into Libanus oh virgen and daughter Zion / and cry. In
Basan also let thy voice be herd / and cry out from all the high ways: for all thy strange gods and images.
lovers ar perished. These things I gave the warninge of / when thou waste yet
in welthy prosperity. But thou answerdst me sayng. I will not hear: this
verily was thy manner eue^ from thy yougth / that thou would not obaye my
voice. All thy pastors shall be ruled and blown away of the wind / and thy
lovers shall be carried away into captivity: and than verily thou shall be shamed
and confounded for thy great wykednes and malice / which yet dwell in Libano
and nestelest in the Cedres. How great shall thy sorrowful sighs be when this
ruin shall fall upon the like panges upon the traueler of child? Jechonias is
called Joachin.
As verily as I live (says the Lord) though Jechonias the sone of Joakim
king of Juda be the signet which I wear on mi right hand: yet shall I pluk
him of from hence: and betake the into the handis of them that seek thy life /
into the power of them whose face thou fear / euem into the hand of
Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon / and into the handis of the Caldes. And shall
translate the and thy mother that bore the into a strange land / where ye were
not borne / but ye shall dye in it. And into this land / whither ye shall so
sore desyer to return / shall ye never come agene. This man Jechonias / shall be
plucked and torn in peses like a co^temptible graven image / which for all his
costely aparel / yet pleases he noma^ wherefore he shall be baneshed / both he
and his sead / and casteforth into an unknown land. But oh earth / earth /
earth: hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord. Bill me this man
barain to be emo^ge the dishereted outelawes / for he shall never more prosper
in all his life: there shall none of his sead prosper / to sit Freely.
in the seat roial of David and to reign Freely
in Juda.

The.xxiii. Chapter.
UVo be the herdemen that destroy and scater my flock / says the Lord.
Wherefore this commandment sends the Lord God of Israel unto the herdemen
that should govern my people. ye destroy and thrust out my flock / and ye
look not upon them. Wherefore I shall look upon your wyked counsels and studyes
(says the Lord) and gather the the ge^tils.
resydew of my flock from all the parts into which I had cast themforth / and
restore them unto my pasture / that they may grow and be increased. I shall
set herdemen over them which shall feed them. They shall no more be afraid nor
dread / for they shall not perish / says the Lord. Behold the time shall
come says the Lord / that I will stere up that rightuouse. Budde or branch
of David to reign and to execute his office prudently in restoring equite and
rightwysnes in the earth.

In his days Juda shall be saved and Israel shall dwell suer. And this is the name
that men shall call him by / even the Lord / our rightwysnes. Wherefore / lo the
time shall come says the Lord / that men shall no more swear. As verily as the
Lord lyuith which led the childern of Israel out of the land of Egypt /
but as verily as the Lord lives which has ledforth and brought agene the
sead of the house of Israel from the north este land: and from all the regions
into which I had dispersed the^ / to dwell in their own land. Woe be to the
Prophetis also. My heart is alto broken / al my bones ar shyured in sondre. I
am like a dronken man troubled with wine: for fear of the Lord and his holy
word. For therthe is full of aduouterers / wherefore it is now come / yt she
being a cursed and aborred / shall wail: and her plesante feldis of the deserte
shall be withred up: For the lyuinge of these men is euel / and their power
contrary to the holy word. Both Prophet and Priest ar polluted and be filthy
ipocrytes / and their maliciouse wykednes is espied eue^ in my house says ye
lord. Wherefore their way shall be slybery / and full of stomblinge stones in
derkenes at which they shall stomble and fall: for I shall bring a plage upon
them / even the day of their visitacio^ / says the Lord. The same foleshnes
which I saw among the Prophetis of Samarye whereby they preched for Baalis
profit and decyued my people of Israel: I have now seen also among the
prophetis of Jerusalem / even filthy stinkinge aduoutery and licenciouse
liberte to lie. They flater and join handis with the most mischeuouse men /
to thentent that every one of them should never return from their wykednes
They al with their cytesens ar unto me like Sodom and the cytesens of Gomorre.
Wherefore thus says the Lord of powers upon the Prophetis. Behold I shall feed
them with wormewode and give thez to drink water mengled with gall. For out
of the Prophetis of Jerusalem ar brokenforth the contagious spottis of al
ipocrysye into all the world. Wherefore thus warns the Lord of powers. Se
that ye lysten not unto the wordis of these prechers that preach unto you: for
they deceive you / speking the vision of their own hertis / and nothing of the
mouth of the Lord. They tell them boldly which depyse me. The Lord says we
shall have prosperous peace: and they tell al them that walk aftir the lusts of
their own hertis. There shall no plage come upon you: for who stood in the
counsel of the Lord to hear and know his mind? Behold / the whirlewynde of
the Lord / that is to say his wrath shall comeforthe and turn hirselfe with
great violence into the headis of the ungodly: Nether shall the lordis wrath be
returned until he has aco^pleshed and finesshed the set purpose of his heart.
But in time to come ye shall understand his counsel. I sent not these Prophetis
(says the Lord) and yet they run. I said nothing to them* and yet they
preach and Prophecye. But had they stood in Hy cou^^els and ^y wor^^s: and ^ot
me^^s.
my counsel and herd my wordis: they had converted my people from their euel
ways and euel thoughtis. Am I god which may se but thingis only at hand
says the Lord / and not thingis al afar? May any man hyde himself so
preuely that I se him not says the Lord? Do not I fulfill both heaven and earth
says the Lord? I have herd verily what manner things the Pre^hers.
Prophetis say: which preche lies under the cloak of my name saing. I dremed I
dremed. How long shall this steke in ye Prophetis hertis to preche lies? and to
preche ye desaight of their own myndis? whose counsel is bente upon this even
to deceive my people with their dremes which they tell every man to draw my
name out of memory / as their fathers forgote my name by process of time
bringingin The ^ope with (...) his ^dols
Baal. That Prophet which has seen a dreme / will preche but a dream. But he
unto whom my word is showed / will speak my word even of faith. What shall
chafe do with wheat says the Lord? Is not my word like fire says the
Lord / and like a twybit cleauinge the rock of stone? wherefore behold me now
agenste the Prophetis says ye Lord: which steal my word from whom they
list. Behold me now agenste ye Prophetis says ye Lord: which take upon
their tongues to say / Thus says ye Lord. Behold me now agenste ye
prophetis / even agenste their lyinge dreams says the Lord: and which
dreams yet dare they mind and speak / to deceive my people with their lies and
feigned miracles: whom I never sent / nor commanded them any thing: which
prophetis shall be full great hurt unto this people / says ye Lord. When this
people / or prophet / or priest / shall ask ye sayng / what manner thing is ye
burden of ye Lord? Thou shall say unto thez. What? Askeyeme of ye burden?
Even yourselues be ye burden. Wherefore I shall cast you of / says ye lord.
And I shall viset both prophet priest and the people which use this word /
the burden of the Lord. I shall viset both him and his house. Also thus shall ye
say to each other. What thing answerth the Lord / or what commandethe the
Lord? but as for the burden of the Lord / shall ye name no more. For every
mannis own word must be his burden / because he has perverted the wordis of
the lyuinge god / even of the Lord of powers which is our god. Thus shall
every man say unto their Prophetis. What has the Lord answerde the? or what
says the Lord? But as for the burden of the Lord / ye shall not once name it.
Wherefore thus spoke the Lord. Because ye have taken into an use this word.
The burden of the Lord / albeit I sent unto you / forbidding to once say the
burden of the Lord: behold I shall suerly reken you to be even my burden. But
I shall cast you of / with this cite also / which I gave you and your fathers.
I shall cast you out of my sight / and lade you with perpetual obprobrie and
shame which shall never be forgoten.

The.xxiiii. Chapter.
THe Lord showed me this vision. Lo / there stood two panyers full of figs
before ye temple of ye Lord aftir that Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon had led
away captive Jechonias the sone of Joachim king of Juda / the princes of Juda
/ smythes and craftsmen from Jerusalem: and had brought them to Babylon. The
one panyer contained very good figs / even siche as ar wont to be first
ripe / and the the other panyer contained as evil figs which might not be eaten
forbitternes. Than the Lord spoke unto me.

What seiste thou I eremy? And I answerde: Figs do I se / of which some be
very good: and some be as badde / so that noman may eat thez. Agene / The
word of ye Lord came to me on this manner. Thus says ye Lord god of Israel.
As thou know the good figs / eue^ so shall I know the men translated from
Juda / whom I sent forth from this place into the land of Chalde / for their
profit: and set my eyes upon them for ye best. For I shall bring them agene
unto this land: and edifye them and not destroy them I shall root them / and
not pluck them up. And I shall give them an heart to know me / that I am the
Lord. They shall be my people / and I their god: for they shall turn to me with all their hertes. And as thou know the evil figs / which for their sowernes
may not be eaten: even so says the Lord shall I set Zedechias the king of
Juda / her rulers / and the rest that remain in this land / and them also
that dwell in Egypt: I shall set them (I say) to be vexed and scourged in every
region of ye earth / to be had in obprobrye / into a proverb / into a fable
and shame in every place whither I shall scater them. And I shall send among
them sword / honger / pestelence / til I have consumed them from the land /
which I gave them and their fathers.

The argument of this Chap.
A^ermone given unto Jeremie upon all the people of Juda: the fourth year of
Joachim the sone of Josias king of Juda: which was the first yete of
Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon. Which sermon Jeremie the Prophet preched unto
all the people of Juda / and before all the cytesens of Jerusalem sayng on this
manner.

The.xxv. Chapitre.
FRom the thirtente year of Josias the sone of Amon king of Juda unto this
day / which is now.xxiii. year / the word of the Lord was committed unto
me: which I spoke unto you rising in time / and constantly warning you / but ye
obayed it not. Albeit the Lord has sent unto you al his seruantis / even his
Prophets erly rising and swyftely sending: yet ye obayed not / nor once
inclined your ears to lysten. Thus verily he said. Turn ye agene every man
from his own evil way / and fro your evil thoughtis / and ye shall inhabit the
land which the Lord gave you and your fathers from age to age. And go not
your ways aftir strange goddis to serve them and to fall down before them:
Anger me not with the workis of your own handis: and I shall not scourge you.
But ye herd me not says the Lord: for ye angered me with the workis of your
handis / but not vnpunesshed. Wherefore thus said the Lord of powers. Because ye
herd not my wordis / therefore behold / I shall send and call upon you all the
nations of the north says the Lord: and even that same Nebuchadrezer also
king of Babylon my seruante / and shall bring them upon this land / and upon
the inhabitours thereof / and upon al these nations rownde a boute / and shall
utterly destroy them. I shall bring them into a deserte / into an hissing and
perpetual desolacion. And I shall take from them the voice of gladness and solace
/ the voice of the brydegrome and spouse / the voice of men oynted and hanged
full of sweet and fresshe flowers to bear the lightis. And all this land shall be
turned into a deserte and wilderness. And they shall serve the foresaid nations
and the king of Babylon.lxx. yearis. And when these lxx. yearis be fulfilled:
I shall also viset ye wikednes of that king of Babylon and of his people says
the Lord / and that same land also of the Caldeis / and bring the^ together
into a perpetual wilderness. And I shall bring upon that land al my wordis
which I have decreed agenst it / eue^ all that be written in this book which
Jeremy prophesied agenst all the gentiles. For even they to shall be bond servants
to many nations and great kings. For I shall reward them aftir their sins
and workis of their own handis. Thus therefore spoke the Lord God of Israel
unto me. Take this cup of the wine of wrath of my hand: that thou may
give to drink thereof al nations unto who^ I shall send the / which once
dronken / might be plucked into furye and madness / the sword coming upon /
which I shall send among them. Than took I the cup of the Lordis hand to
give drink to all the nations unto who^ the Lord sent me. But first of al I
gave even Jerusalem hirselfe and the cites of Juda / her kings and princes to
drink thereof / to bring them into a deserte and wyldernes / into an hissinge
and execrable curse / even as we see unto this day ye I gave al nations
indifferently to drink thereof / as Pharao king of Egypt / his seruantis and
his rulers with all his people / all the kingis of Ausitidis / al ye kings of the
land of the Palestines. Ascalon / Gazam / Accarone^ with all the left cites of
Aschote / the Idumes / Moabites and the sons of Ammon / all the kings of Tyri
and Sidon / the kings of the eylandis beyende the sea / Dedan / Thema / Buz /
and the clipped headid Ismasitis. All the kings of Araby / all the kingis one with
a another that dwell in the deserte / all the kingis of Zimri / all the kingis of
Elam / all the kingis of Mede / all the kings of the north este both nighe and
far every one with his borderer / and all the kingdoms of the earth which are
upon the face of the rownde world. And let king Sesach drink with the^ to.
And thou shall say unto the^. This is the Lord of powers even ye God of
Israel his pleasure and commandment: Drink and be dronken / run to gither
that ye might fall never to rise agene / ye and that by the sword which I shall
send among you. And if they refuse to take the cup of thy hand to drink:
than shall thou say unto them. Thus threateneth you the Lord of powers. ye
shall drink it suerly. For so I begin to scourge the cite named aftir my nowne
name: and shall I let you than escape vnpuneshed? Verily ye shall not go quyte.
For I now call for a sword to come upon all the inhabitours of therthe says ye
Lord of powrs. Wherefore se that thou preach them al these sermons: and tell
the^. The Lord shall thondre from above / and shall cry a loud from his holy
habitacio^. He shall thonder with great noise from his kingis haule. The loud
noise like the grape gatherers shall come before upon al thin habitours of
therthe: and the sown shall be brought unto the uttermost costs of therthe. For
the Lord will sit in judgment upon the nations and declare him self the judge
of al manner men living to betake the ungodly unto the sword / says the Lord.
For thus says the Lord of powers. Behold / a miserable calamite shall go
through the gentyles one aftir another: and a great whirlewinde shall be stered
up from diverse costs of therthe / and ye sword shall krepe through with
slaughter in that day from one cost of therthe to the the other. Noman shall be
moorned for non gatherde up / noman buried: but like donge shall they lie upon
ye face of therthe. Howl out oh ye pastors and cry / bespriene your selue
with ashes oh ye ra^mes and leaders of the flock / for ye time of your
slaughter and down tredinge is fulfilled: and ye shall faldowne together like
costely byral vessels made to co^tayne daintes. There shall be no way to fle for
the pastors / for the rams of the flock shall not escape. Than shall the
pastors cry out / and the ra^mes of the flock shall howl. For the Lord
shall waste and consume their pastures. And their best feldis shall lie dead with
out noise / for the furye of the Lordis wrath. They shall forsake their foldes
weping and roringe like lions. For their land shall be desolate for his
indignacion and furiouse wrath.

The.xxvi. Chapter.
IN the begininge of the reign of Joachim / son of Josias king of Juda /
this word was showed of the Lord. Thus says the Lord: Stand in the fore
court of the temple / and speak unto all the cites of Juda which come to ye
house of the Lord to do their worshipe. Speak all the sermons which I command
the. And be ware thou take not away one word / y t if thus paraduenture yet
they may obaye and return every man from his own wiked way yt it might for
think me of ye plages which I had ordened for them for their own maliciouse
minds and counsels. And thou shall say (I tell the) unto them. Thus says the
Lord: If ye obaye me not to walk in my laws which I have given you / hearing
the sermons of my servants the Prophetis whom I send unto you / erly rysinge
and yet still sending. If you (I say) obaye not: I shall make this same house
like unto Sylo: and even thissame cite shall I cast into a contumeliouse curse
to be aborred of all the nations of the earth. And the Priestis and Leuits with all the people herd Jeremy preching these sermons in the house of the Lord.
Wherefore when Jeremy had made an end of all that the Lord commanded him to
preche unto the people: the Priestis / Prophetis and all the people did set hold
upon him and took him saing. Thou must dye. Wherefore prechedst thou as though
the Lord had commanded the / that it should hapen unto this house as it did
once to Sylo / and that this cite should be destroyed that noman should inhabit
it? And when all the people were gathered to gither in the temple about Jeremye
/ the rumor of this matter came unto the chief rulers of Juda / which a non
camvp from the kings palace unto the house of the Lord: and sat down to
gither before the new door of the temple. Than came the Priestis and Prophetis
unto the rulers and to all the people saying these wordis This man is giltye
death / for he preched agenst this cite / as he ye have herd with your ears.
Than said Jeremye unto all the rulers and to all the people / these words. The
Lord sent me to preche agenste this house and this cite all that ye have
herd. Now therefore amend your lyuinge and your thoughtis / and obaye the
voice of your Lord God: and than it shall forthinke the Lord God of
thaffliccio^ / which he has decreed agenste you. And as for me / lo I am in
your handis / do with me what seems to you right and good. But yet this one
thing I assuer you / that if ye kill me / ye shall make your selves / this cite
/ and the citesens thereof gilty my innocent blood. For this I ensuer you: the
Lord has sent me to you to preach into your ears al these sermons. Than
said the Princes and all the people unto the Priestis and Prophetis: ye can
find no cause of death in this man / since he preched unto us in the name / of
our Lord. Also the elders of the land rose up to gither sayng unto the hole
company of the people on this manner. Micheas Morastith / was a Prophet in the
days of Ezechias king of Juda: and this Micheas said to all the folk of Juda.
Thus says the Lord of powers. Zion shall be ploughed up like a field: and
Jerusalem shall be turned into an heap of stones: And the hill where the house
of ye Lord stands into an high wode. And yet notwithstanding this sermon
/ did nether Ezechias king of Juda nor yet the comen people go once about to
slaye him? This president ye priests brouht forthage^st Jeremy nothing
consydering that Vrias was unjustly slain.
But did they not rather reverently fear the Lord / and prayed him to turn a
way his wrath? Where upon it forthinked him of the plage which he had decreed
upon them. And shall we now commit so great a crime agenste our selves? But
yet was there a another that preached constantly in the name of the Lord /
called Vrias the sone of Semee of Cariathiearim which preched agenst this cite
and land in all poyntis even aftir the sermons of Jeremye: And king Joachim
with all the great men and rulers herd his sermons: where upon the king sought
to kill him. But when Vrias herd of it / he feared and fled into Egypt. Then
sent king Joachim officers into Egypt as Elnathan the sone of Achbor with
certain sergeants with him which led Vrias out of Egypt / and brought him to
king Joachim / which slew him with his sword / and cast his carkas into
the comen place of other malefactors. But as for Jeremye is helped of Ahikam
the sone of Saphan / that he be not given into the handis of the people to be
slain. These thingis were done of the Lord / to Jeremye / in the beginning
of the reign of Joachim sone of Josias king of Juda.

The Argument of this Chapter following.
The Lord decreid firmly to subdwe all the kingdoms of the este / to
thonelyand head kingdom of Babylon. And declares also that the Prophetis
which prophesied al thingis to be restored / and every man to come home agene
withyn two year: were but liars.

The.xxvii. Chapter.
Thus spoke the Lord unto me. Make the kolers and chains fet for thy neck /
and send them to the king of Edom / to the king of Moab / to the king of
the childerne of Ammon / to the king of Tire / to the king of Zidon / and
that by thambassiadours that be now come to Jerusalem to Zedechias king of
Juda / commanding them to bear these messages unto their masters. Thus
commands you ye Lord of powers and God of Israel / that ye tell your
masters thus. I am he that made the earth / man and beast which are upon ye
face of ye earth through my great pour and forthstretched arm: and given it unto
him whom it has pleased me. And now shall I give up al these regions into the
power of my servant Nebuchadnezar king of Babylon. I shall give him also the
beastis of the field to do him service: And al nations shall serve him / and his
sone and his neuye. Many nations and great kingis shall serve him (I say) until
the time of destruction
time also of the same land be come to. And that nation or kingdom which
wilnot serve Nebuchadnezer king of Babylon / nor wilnot put their neckis under
the yoke of the king of Babylon / I shall viset even the same nation with
sword honger and pestelence until I have consumed them in his handis says the
Lord. Wherefore se that ye hear not your prophets / dyuines / dream sayers /
sorcerers / charmers / which tell you: ye shall not serve the king of Babylon.
For they preach you lies / to send you a way far from your land: and that
I should expel you that ye might perisshe. But the nation that will put his
neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him: them shall I leave
still upon their own land / says the Lord: and they shall replenisshe it and
inhabit it / ye and even unto Zedechias king of Juda have I told ye same
thing in every point sayng. Put your necks under the yoke of the king of
Babylon / and serve him and his people / that al youers might be salfe. Wherefore
shuldeye be slain / both thou and thy people with sword / honger / and
pestelence? as ye Lord has decreed it upon what so ever nation it be / that
refuses to serve the king of Babylon. And yet I tell you agene. Hear not the
sermons of the Prophetis prechinge and sayng unto you. Serve not the king of
Babylon: for they preche you but a lie. Nether did I send them / says the
Lord / although they be so bold to preche lies in my name / that I should the
sooner cast you forth to perisshe with these men that thus preche unto you.
Also I spoke unto the preistis and to all this people thus. This commands the
Lord. Hear not the wordis of ye prophetis preching you these thingis. Behold
/ the Iwel^s of the house of the Lord shall be brought agene shortly from
Babylon: For thy preach you but a lie / hear them not / but serve ye king of
Babylon that ye may abide salfe. Wherefore should this cite be brought into a
wyldernes? And if they will nedis be proved trwe Prophetis and the word of the
Lord to be committed unto thim: let them make intercession (I beseech you)
before the Lord of powers that the reamnaunte of ye iues and vessels of ye
lordis house / of ye kingis house of Juda / and of Jerusalem come not to
Babylon to. For thus spoke ye lord of powers as towchinge ye pylers / ye lauer
and the socketis with other vessels and Iwels yet left in this cite: which
Nebuchadnezar king of Babylon took not a way / when he carried away Jechonias
ye sone of Joachim king of Juda / from Jerusalem to Babylon with all the rulers
of Juda and Jerusalem. Thus (I say) spoke the Lord of powers even the God of
Israel as concerning the rest of these vessels and iuels both of the house of
the Lord and of the kingis house of Juda and of Jerusalem. They shall be
translated to Babylon there to continwe til I shall viset them agene (sathe the
Cord) and then shall I restore and bring them agene into this same place.

The.xxviii. Chapter.
IT came so to pass / That in the four the year of Zedechias king of Juda /
the fiste month: Ananias the sone of Azur / Prophet of Gabaon / spoke unto me
in the house of the Lord in the presence of the preistis and of all the people
saying. Thus said the Lord of powers the God of Israel. I have broken in
peises the yoke of the king of Babylon. So that aftir.ii. year / I shall
restore into thissame place all the vessels and iuels of the house of the Lord:
Which Nebuchadnezar king of Babylon took out of this place and translated
into Babylon. ye / and even Jechonias sone of Joachim king of Juda with all the
captives of Juda which are led to Babylon / I shall bring agene unto this place
/ says the Lord. For I shall break the king of Babylonis yoke. Then Jeremy ye
Prophet answerde the prophet Anamas before the priestis and all the people
standing by them in the house of the Lord. And the Prophet Jeremie said Amen
/ the Lord might it so do / and make thy prophecy to stand / in restoringe
the iuels of the lordis house and all the captives from Babylon into this place.
Nethelesse yet hear what I shall say to the in the presens of all this people.
The Prophetis which were before us in all times paste / both over many regions
and great kingdoms / propheciyng other batail / calamite / pestilence / or
peace / were proved trwe in this one thing / that ye Lord doutles had sent
thez: if the thing came so to pass / which the prophet had told them
before. And Anamas the Prophet took a chain from the Prophet Jeremies neck
and alto broke it in pieses / sayng on this manner / all the people hearing it.
Thus says the Lord.

Even thus shall I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezar king of Babylon with in
these.ii. years from the nek of every nation. And here Jeremy went his ways
home. But the word of the Lord was showed him aftir Ananias the Prophet had
broken the chain from ye Prophet Jeremyes neck on this manner. Go and tell
Ananias these words. Thus says the Lord. Ananias / thou have broken cheynes
of wode / but for the^ / Jeremye thou / shall make agene chains of yerne. For
thus says ye Lord of powers the God of Israel. I shall lay a yoke of yerne
upon al these nations that they shall serve Nebuchadnezar king of Babylon /
that shall they. And even the beastis of ye field shall I betake unto him / so
shall I. Than said the Prophet Jeremy unto ye Prophet Ananias. Hear (I beseech
the) Ananias. The Lord sent the not: but thou goist a boute to bring this
people into a vain and false hope. Wherefore thus says the Lord. Behold / I
shall send ye therefore: but whither? verily even from the face of the earth.
For withyn this same year shall thou be dead. For full emnyously and
despightfully have thou spoken agenste ye Lord. And so Ananias dyed the same
year in the seventh monethe.

The argument of this.xxix. Chapter. There arose certain false Prophetis among
the captynes in Babylon / which promised themselves liberty to return aftir
Ananias his saing with in two year: but these false Prophetis Jeremye
confutethe.
THese ar the words of ye pistle which the prophet Jeremy sent from Jerusalem
unto ye men in captivity: both to the elders / priests / prophets / and to ye
people also whom Nebuchadnezar had led a way to Babylon: aftir that king
Jechonias and his queen / and the g^lded men / ye rulers of Juda and Jerusalem
/ sinythes also with ye artificers were gone. Aelassa sone of Saphan and
Gamaria sone of helkie bering it.

Whom Zedechias king of Juda sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezar king of
Babylon: the pistel (I say) co^tayning these wordis. Thus says ye Lord of
powers ye God of Israel unto all the captives that are led from Jerusalem to
Babylon. Buyld ye houses to dwell in / plant gardens and hortyardis to eat
their fruits / marye wives to bringforth sons and daughters: ye / and give
your sons and your daughters housbandes that they may bringforthe sons and
daughters / and increase there gretely. Study in nowyse to be few in nowmber
But study for ye prosperouse peace of ye same cite wheryn ye be holde^ captive
and pray to the Lord for it: For their peace shall be yours. For thus says ye
Lord of powers ye god of Israel. Let not ye prophets with your diuynes that are
with you deceive you. Nether believe your own dreams which ye dream. For these
me^ prophecye unto you lies in my name. I sent the^ not says ye lord. But
thus says ye Lord. When ye have fulfilled.lxx. years in Babylon / I shall
viset and deal with you aftir my goodness to bring you agene into this place. For
I forgete not my set purposes decreed upon you / says ye Lord. They are
counsels of holsom peace and not of troublouse affliccio^ / to give you another
manner chance / yt ye might have a fresshe a better hope. ye shall cry unto me
/ and I shall hear you. ye shall seek me / and find me: If ye sek me with all
your heart / I will be fownde (I say) of you / says ye Lord: and I shall redeem
you from captivity: and gather you from out of al ye ge^tyles and from al
places where in to I had dispersed you / says ye Lord / and restore you into
thissame place fro whence I led you captive. But as touching this / where ye
say the lord to have stered up Prophets in Babylon. Thus says ye Lord /
both as concerning thissame king yt yet sits in ye set of David / and al
ye people yt inhabit this cite / with your brothern yt are not yet gone with you
into captivity: thus (I say) says ye Lord of powers upon the^. Lo / I shall
send among the^ ye sword / ho^ger / and pestilence / and make the^ like
unripe figs which for their bitterness may not be eaten. And I shall persecute
the^ with sword / ho^ger and pestilence. I shall give the^ to be vexid of al ye
ki^gdo^s of therthinto an execracion to be aborred / into an outhissinge and
obprobry among al nations where so ever I shall scater them / because they obayed
not my commandments (says the Lord) which I sent them by my seruantis the
Prophetis erly rysinge and evermore sendinge: but yet obayed they not / says
the Lord. And al you in captivity / whom I sent from Jerusalem to Babylon /
hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord of powrs the God of Israel /
as concerning Ahab the sone of Colie / and Zedekia sone of Maasie which
prophecy lies unto you in my name. Behold / I shall give them into the handis
of Nebuchadnezar ki^ge of Babylon to slaye them before your faces. And all the
captives of Juda which ar in Babylon shall take up this word of excecracion
upon them saying. The lord rid the^ out of the way as he did Zedekias and
Ahab: who^ the king of Babylon fried in the fire because they committed wyked
folishnes agenste Israel: For when they had defiled their neghbours wives / yet
went they and preched lies in my name which I never commanded them. These
things do I certifye and testifye unto you says the Lord. But as touching
Semeia ye Neemalite / thus shall thou tell him. Thus says the Lord of powers
the God of Israel. Since thou haste sent letters under thy nown name sealed /
unto the people in Jerusalem and also unto Zephanias zephanias is magister
inquisitor heretice prauitatis: yt is master heretic taker.
sone of Maasie Priest / and to all the Priestis also: in which thou spekest to
him thus.

For as much as the Lord has set ye being Priest / in the stead of the
Priest Joiada to bear rule in the house of the Lord / and to search for all
furiouse sprited Prophets that preach or prophecy / to cast them into
presone or stocks: how hapeneth it / that thou take not and correckest not
Jeremy of Anathot that precheth with you so continually? Which over all this
yet he sent unto us that are here holden in Babylon / sayng plainly our
captivity to be very long / bidding us to build houses to dwelyn / and plant
orteyardes whose fruit we might eat. Which letters Zephanias the Priest red
over / Jeremy the Prophet hearing the^. Then was the word of the Lord showed
unto Jeremy sayng thus: Tell the hole company in captivity thus. Thus says
the Lord upon Semeia that Neelamite. Since Semeias has thus preached unto you
with out my commandment stuffinge you full of vain hopes: therefore this is
the Lords pleasure. Behold / I shall viset Semeias the Neelamyte and his sede /
so that non of his shall neuermore dwell among this people: nether shall they se
that goodness which I shall do unto this people says the Lord: for he has
preached emayously and spite fully upon the Lord.

The.xxx. Chapter.
THe sermon showed of the Lord unto Jeremy: Thus spoke the Lord of Israel.
Write me up to gither in a book all the sermons which I have spoken unto the.
For lo / the time shall come says the Lord / that I shall make a joyful and
salfe return of my captiued people of Israel and Juda says the Lord. For I
shall restore them agene into the land which I gave their fathers / and they
shall possede it. But ye Lord added these thingis to / speking upon Israel and
Juda on this manerwyse. We hear a a terrible and dredeful noise as though al
thingis were in fereful confusion. For what else signifies this sight / every
man be he never so manly / thus to smite his handis upon his loins like a
woman trauelinge of child? Who saw ever a man trauelinge of child? Enquire
and search out this vision if ye will. ye and every ma^nis face is deformed
with pale wanne color. Out ahlasse for this day / so horrible so dreadful /
that never was there any like. Oh time of tribulacion unto Jacob: fro the
which yet he shall be delyuerde. For the day shall come / says the Lord of
powers / that I will break of N^buchadnezars yoke from thy neck / and break of
thy bondis to / that thou set^est no more strange gods under him. But eue^ they
shall serve their Lord God to / that is to say their king David: whom I shall
sterevp for them. And thou Jacob my servant / fear not / says the Lord: nor
be not dismayde Israel. For lo / I shall save the / although thou beist yet
far of / and bring thy seade from the land of their captivity. And Jacob
shall be brought agene: he shall have rest flowing in all prosperity / to fear
noman. For I am with the / says the Lord / to save the: Albe it yet must I
make an end of all the nations among whom I have scaterd the: but yet the /
shall I not make an end of: but chastise ye in the mean time / but yet with
i^ugement and discrecion: For I know the not in any wise for innocent. For thus
says the Lord. I pytye thy decease and sorrow for the smarte of thy wound but
there is noman that may aue^ge thy cause delyuering the by judgment bring the
agene into the way / or bind up thy wound / and so to further thy cure. All
thy lovers have forgote^ the / they seek the no more. For I have smyten the with
a cruel plage / and correcked the sharply / and that even for the multitude of
they nowne wikednes for thy sins have prevailed. Wherefore lamentest thou thy
destruction? It is I myself yt pityeth thy sorrowful grief. But for the
manifold wikednes and outrage of thy sins / delte I thus with the. Wherefore
al men yt devour the / shall be devoured again / and al thy enymes shall be led
into captivity.

They that rob ye shall be robbed: and of al the^ that spoil the / I shall make
a spoil of them agene. For I will restore ye thy health and heal thy woundis
says ye Lord / because they called the a neglecte abiecte oh Zion / and eue^
her / whom noma^ would set bye. For thus says the Lord: Behold I shall
restore the tabernacles of Jacob and favor his habitacions. Thy cite shall be
edifyed again in her old place: and the temple shall have her just foundation:
and praise and the voice of gladmen shall goforth of the^. I shall increase the^
/ and they shalnot be minisshed. I shall enlarge the^ / and they shalnot be
drawn in. And their chylderne shall be as before. And their church shall
co^tinwe and increase before me / and all that moleste or oppress them / I
meselfe shall viset and look upon the^. And I shall give them a noble goyde and
head ruler to go for the eue^ of the mids of the^ / and even this man will I
sociat and join unto miself: and he shall be full nighe me. But who shall this man
be / whose heart shall so swetely be married unto me / says the Lord? Through
this your goyde / shall ye be my people and I shall be your God. But lo / first
shall the fury of ye Lord come forth like a whirlewynde / ye like an hastye
raueshing violent whirlewinde shall it come / eue^ into the heads of the
ungodly. This furiouse wrath of ye Lord shall not cease until he has done and
acomplesshed the thoughtis of his heart. Which ye shall know at last in these
later days. In that time (says the Lord) I shall be the God of all the famylye
of Israel / and they shall be my people.

The.xxxi. Chapter.
THus says the Lord. The people of Israel / which escaped sometime the sword
in the deserte: fownde favor to come unto their rest. And eue^ so now shall
the Lord show himself unto me being in far parts sayng. I love with a
perpetual love: wherefore I spread my mercy over the. I shall bylde the to be
fast and suer / oh virgen Israel. Thou shall take up and tuwne thy tympanys
again / and goforth merrily leding the daunse. yet agein shall thou plant
vynyardis in the hills of Samary: and ye vine kepers shall plant singinge. And
when the time shall come the kepers shall cry thoroute the mountain of Ephraim
Arise and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God: for thus says the
Lord: Be glad and rejoice for Jacobs sake ^^ye^t forth even at ye head of the
gentyles. Babylon was then ye head cite of ye ge^tils.
Preche / singe / and tell the^. The Lord will desyuer and save his people /
even the reamnaunt of Israel. Lo / I shall bring them again from the north
regions / and gather them together from the costis of the earth / with the blind
and lame which are among them / with weme^ great with child / and with them
also that now be delivered. And there shall be a great church or company of the
returners hither agein. They went away wepinge: but I shall bring them agein
with solace. By the sweet ryuers / a plain and plesaunte straight way where
they shalnot stomble shall I lead them for to return. For I will be Isreal's
father. And Ephraim shall be my first begote^ son. Hear ye Gentyles the word
of the Lord: and tell it forth through the eylandis which stand so far in
sondre / sainge: He that had scatred Israel gathers them to gither agein /
and shall keep them as the herdemen his own flock. For the Lord will deliver
Jacob / and avenge him from a full mighty hand. And they shall come and rejoice
in the mount Zion / and be increased with the benefits which the Lord shall
give them / as wheat / sweet wynes / oil / flocks and he^des. And their
hertes shall be like a fruteful fresshe garden: nether shall they any more be
hongrye. Than shall the maid / and as well yt old m^n as ye young daunseful
meresy. For I shall turn their weepy moorning into fressbe gladness / and
costforte and there the^ from their heaviness. Also I shall enbrewe ye Priestis
minds with fat of fri^ges
fatnes / and my people shall be sated and filled with my benefits says ye Lord.
And yet thus also said ye Lord. The lamentable noise of moornes and their
bitter weping ascended unto heaven: even ye voice of Rachel wepi^g for her
childern / nether would she receive any consolacio^ for the^ / because they
were clean gone captiued But now says the Lord: peace and weep no more / wype
thy eyes: for thy paynful labors shall be looked upon says ye Lord. And they
shall return from that cruel region: but yet shall it be thy posterite that shall
hope for this / says the Lord. For they be your chylderne that shall return
into their own region. Even Ephraim goinge into captivity did I hear verily
thus complayninge. Thou haste chastised me oh Lord / being then like a wild
bullok / but now shall I receive thy nourtering and disciplyne. Our conversion
begins of God. a token of repentance
But thou therefore now convert me / and I shall be converted: for thou Lord art
my God. Wherefore as soon as thou shall convert me / I shall repent me / and
anon as thou shall make me to know my sin / I shall smite my handis upon my
thighe. Very shame confounds me for my sins committed in my yougthe / which
now grievously obrayde me to my great peine. At this penitent complaynte of
Ephraim / I thought thus with myself / says ye Lord. Is not Ephraim my
goodly plesaunt child? Is he not my tender fayer whight son? I reme^bir him
even from the time of our first communicacio^: wherefore my very heart yammerth
and all my bowels ar moved upon him. I will gladly have compassion upon him
says the Lord. Get the well watchinge overseers standing on high: and take
unto the sharp teachers and warners: and let thy heart attend unto the pathe
of yt same way whereby thou must walk. And return oh virgin Israel: return
unto these same / even thy nowne cytes. How long will thou err oh strayng
bakslyden daughter? For the Lord verily shall make ^a new thing in this
land: the woman shall take her husbonde in her arms. For thus says the Lord
of powrs the God of Israel. The time shall come yt they shall say in the land
of Juda / and in her cytes aftir that I have brought them agene / even these
words. Ose. ii
The Lord which is ye fayer spouse of righteousness might favor and bless
the oh holy hill. For there shall herdemen and tylme^ inhabit both Juda and al
her cytes. For I shall satisfye the hongry soul and replenesshe every meke
soul. When I herd this / I came to my self agene consydering as though I had
waked from a very sweet sleep. Behold / the time is come says the Lord / yt
I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Juda with man and beast. And the
time shall come / yt likewise as I was occupied in plucking up by ye rotes / in
scatering abrede / castinge dewne / desiroynge and scourginge the^: eue^ so
shall I study diligently to edifye / and to plant the^ / says ye Lord. In
these days shall they no more say. that is ^chyl^^ein be (...) for their
fathers fawtis
They were our fathers yt eite the so^wer grape / and yet t^eir childers tethe
be (...). ^ For every man shall dye for his own^ wykednes. So that every man
that eat the so^ were grape / his own tethe m^ste oe ^n edge. Behold the days
shall come says the Lord / yt I will smite up a (...) both with the house of
Israel and with the house of Juda: not aftyr the bargen that I smote with their
fathers what time I took them by their handis and led them out of the land of
Egypt: which my bargen and testament they broke / and I punisshed the^
sharply / says the Lord. But this is ye covenant that I will smite with the
house of Israel aftir these days new spoken of so often says the Lord I shall
grif^ my law into their minds / and write it in their hertis / and I will be
their God / and they shall be my people: so that it shall not be (...) man that
shall teach his neghbo^r or his brother by monesshing him sayng / knowledge ye
Lord: but every man shall know me from the least to the gretest / says the
Lord / because I will be merciful to their wikednes and never more remember
their sins.

Thus spoke the Lord which gave the sone into the dayelight / and ordrely ye
moan and stars to shine in the night: which troubles the sea that it
swells up in to waves / whose name is the Lord of powers. Like as this law
shall never be taken away fro my sight / says the Lord: eue^ so (I tell you)
shall the sead of Israel never cease / at any time never more to be a nacio^
before me. Also this said the Lord. As the heaven above cannot be mesured:
nether the foundacions of therthe that be under us / serched: even so / nether
shall I cast away all the sead of Israel for all the things that they have
committed / says the Lord. Lo the days shall come says ye Lord / that the
cite of ye Lord shall be enlarged even from the tower of Hananeel unto the
corner gate in the walls / and from thenceforthe shall mesure be taken forth
right before it unto ye hill top of Gareb / and shall so come about closing
in Goatha and all the vale where they cast their cario^s and ashes or duste /
and so forth al Semeroth unto ye brook called Cedron / and so from thence unto
ye corner of the horse fayer gate age^ste the este: where the holy temple of
the Lord shall be set. And this cite restored aftir this manner / shall no more
be beten down nor destroyed for ever.

The.xxxii. Chapter
THe sermon of the Lord / showed to Jeremye the.x. year of Zedechias king of
Juda: which was the.xviii. year of Nebuchadrezar. Than the host of the king
of Babylon laid sege to Jerusalem. And Jeremy the Prophet was in hold in the
utter ward which was at the kings house of Juda: wheryn Zedechias king of
Juda had cast him / because he prophesied thus. Thus says ye Lord: Lo / I
shall give up this cite into the handis of the king of Babylon / and he shall
take it. And king Zedechias shall not escape the handis of the Chaldes: but
douteles shall be delyuerde into the handis of the king of Babylon / which shall
speak with him mouth to mouth / and shall behold each other face to face. And
Zedechias shall be led to Babylon / there to co^tinew til I viset him / says the
Lord. But if thou will nedis fight age^ste the Caldes: thou shall fight
infortunatly: Unto the which accusacion / Jeremy thus answerde. It was the
Lord that spoke unto me on this manner: Lo Hananeel the sone of Sellum thy
eames sone shall come to the / desyering ye to redeem for thy self the field
which lies in Anathot / because it pertayneth to the to bye it agene by ye
reason thou art next of kin. Than came Hananeel my eames sone acording to
the sayng of ye Lord unto me into the vtterwarde of the presone / sayng: I
pray ye bye my field which is in Anathot in the Land of Benjamin: for it is
thy right by the reason of next of our kin. Redeem it therefore I pray the. I
know all this to be done by the Lordis commandment / wherefore I bought this
field of Hananeel my eames sone which dwelled at Anathot. And I wayed him forth
his money even.vii. sicles and.x. peses of silver. And the writing made and
sealed and witness called to / I wayd forth the money in the skoles: and
received the copye whereby I challenged and posseded it. Aftir this was it sealed
acording to the form of the law and dew order / and rehearsed with the copye
thereof. And I delyuerd this copye whereby I held it unto Baruch ye son of
Nerie / son of Mahasie (Hananeel my eames son being present before ye
witnesses whose names were written in ye instrument whereby I held it) al ye
Iwes at last being by which sat about us in the said ward: commanding this
Baruch before them on this manner. This is ye Lord of powers pleasure ye God of
Israel / yt thou receyuest this instrument sealed with this copye / and put it
into an erthe^ pot yt it may continue long. For thus has ye Lord of
powers / ye God of Israel decreed: That ye houses / feldes / and vynyardis in
this land / shall be possessed agein. Wherefore I made my prayer to ye Lord aftyr
ye delyuerau^ce of this instrument unto Baruch the sone of Neerie on this manner
sayng: Ah lord God: lo thou art he yt made heaven and earth by thy mighty power
and high strength and nothing is hard or of difficulty unto ye. Thou doist
mercy upon thousandis / thou rewardest ye wikednes of the fathers into the
bosoms of their childern which are borne aftir the^. Thou art yt great and
mighty God / whose name is ye Lord of powers / great in counsel and infinite
in thought. Thy eyes behold all the ways of man to reward every man for his
own ways and for ye fruits of his inuencio^s. Which have done signs and
wondres in the land of Egypt / as we well know even unto this day / as well
upon this same Israel as upon these me^ to magnifye thy name as it is right
great unto this day. And thou leddest forth Israel thy people out of ye land
of Egypt with signs and wou^ders / with a mighty hand / a forthstretched arm and
great power. And gave the^ thissame land / as thou had sworn to their
fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey. But wha^ they were
come and had posseded it: they obayed not thy voice / nor walked not in thy
law: but what so ever thou co^mandest them to do / yt they did not. wherefore
al these affliccions and plages ar come upon the^ Lo they come with bulwarkis
eue^ unto this cite to take it / which overcome with sword / ho^ger / and
pestelence / shall be delyuerd up into ye hands of the Chaldeis which even now
fight so sore against it. And what so ever thou have said / it shall come to
pass / for lo / al things ar present unto ye. And yet / thou Lord God
notwithstanding / co^ma^dest me sayng: challenge ye thy field / ye money paid
before witness / wha^ ye cite in ye mea^ ceason must come into ye ha^dis of ye
Cal^es? Tha^ came ye word of ye lord to me. Lo / I am ye lord God of al
things lyui^ge: is there any thing hard unto me? Wherefore thus co^manderh ye
lord. Lo / I shall betake this cite into ye power of ye Caldes and into ye
nower of Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon which shall take it. For the Chaldes
shall come and fight agenst this cite and set fire on it / and it shall be burned
with the houses in whose parlers they burned sacrifices to Baal / and offered to
strange Gods / that they might the more provoke me to anger. For when ye
childerne of Israel and Juda had done al manner of sin in my sight even fro
their yeugth. What else was it that they did than provoked me only by the
workis of their own handis / says ye lord? Or what else was this cite / than
a provoking stock of my wrath fro the day that it was bylded unto this
present hour? In which hour / I shall well worthily take it a way from out
of my sight for the sins of the chylderne of Israel and Juda / which they
committed to anger me / both they their selves / their kings / their rulers /
their priests / their Prophets / al Juda / and the cytesens of Jerusalem.
They turned their backs and not their face to me / when I taught them and
warned them in time: nether gave they ear to receive my disciplyne. They did
set their idols in ye house consecrated unto my name to pollute it. They
bylded high places for Baal in ye vale of Benhinnon their to consecrate and to
give their sons and daughters even to Moloch: which thing I never commanded
them / nether did it ever touch my mind / that I would thus draw Juda into
syn to commit these abominacions. Over this yet agein spoke the Lord God of
Israel / as concerning this cite which (even yourselues being present) shall be
given up into the hand of the king of Babylon / the cite (I say) first
ouercomen with sword / honger and pestelence. Lo I shall gather them from all the regio^s into which I had dispersed them in my wrath / furye / and great
indignacion / and shall bring them into this same place / where they shall dwell
suer. They shall be my people / and I their God. And I shall give them one heart /
and one way that they might fear me at al times. Which thing shall profit
them and their childerne aftir them.

Also I shall smite an everlasting covenant with them / that I will never cease
to do them good / that I will give my fear into their hertis / that they fall
not fro me / that I shall delyght in doing them good / ye and that I shall plant
them in this land in very truth with all my heart and with all my soul. For
thus said ye Lord / like as I have brought upon this people all this great
affliccion: even so shall I bring upon them ageine al manner of goodness which I
have laid up for them. And their feldis shall be possessed in this land / which
ye grant now worthily to bedesolated and for saken of man and beast / and to
be brought into the handis of ye Caldes. The feldis (I tell you) shall be bought
with money / instrumentis written there upon and sealed before witness in the
land of Benjamin and rowndaboute Jerusalem / thorowout the cytes in the
deserte. For I shall bring ageyn their captivity / says the Lord.

The.xxxiii. Chapter.
Again / the word of God came unto Jeremye / while he was yet in hold in the
utter ward / on this manner. Thus says ye Lord which brings his word to
pass / the Lord which accomplessheth his thoughtis and purposes / even he
whose name is the Lord. Thou cryedst unto me / and I answerde the / and I
expowned the great and high things which were unknown unto you. Thus (I
say) says the Lord God of Israel as concerning the houses of this cite and
the kingis houses of Juda to be thronedowne with ordinance and weapen / the
caldes now coming upon to won it / fillinge these houses with mennis caryons
/ whom I shall smite in my wrath and furye / my face turned away fro this cite
for the multitude of their malice. Lo / I shall close up their wounds and heal
them. I shall open them the tresure of peace and faithfulness: And I shall suerly
bring again Juda and Israel and restore them as they were before. And I shall
pourge them from al heir wykednes committed agenst me / and parden al their
sins done so spyght fully agenst me: whereby I shall get me a blessed and glad
name into my praise and glory among all the nations of therthe which shall
hear of al my goodness showed upon them. For they shall fear and be astoned to
se how great goodness and peace I shall bestow on them so lovingly. Also thus
says ye Lord. And again / there shall be herd in this place which ye say
also shall be turned into a wilderness / so that nether man nor beast shall be in it
/ and in the cite of Juda / and without Jerusalem / which also shall be
desolate / so that another man nor beast inhabit them / there shall be herd (I
say) ye voice of men making myrthe joy and solace / even the voice of the
brydegrome with his spouse / and the voice of men singinge. Magnifye ye the Lord
of powers: for right good is the Lord whose mercy endures for ever. There
shall be herd the voice of men knowleging God with giftis in the Lordis house.
For I shall restore ye captivity of this land into their old state says the
Lord. Thus says the Lord of powers. There shall be ageyn in this region now
desolate man and best and in all her cytes / in the cytes of the mountayns / of
the playnes / and in the deserte / herdeme^nis lodges kepinge their flocks: In
the land of Benjamin / in the field of Jerusalem / and in the cytes of Juda /
the flocks shall be noumbred agene under the handis of ye teller / says the
Lord. Behold the days shall come says the Lord / that I shall perform this
goodness which I have promised to the house of Israel and Juda. In these days
and in that time / I shall bringforthe yt rightuouse budde of David which shall
do equity and righteousness upon the earth. Christ is that rightwyse budde.
In these days Juda shall be made salfe / and Jerusalem shaldwel suerly. And he
shall be called in her / even thus. The Lord our rightwisnes. For even thus
promyseth God. The sead of David shalnot be without a man to sit in the
kings seat of the house of Israel. The preistis also and the Levites shall not
lak a man to offer before me sacrifices to burn the sacrifice / ministringe
and offeringe the slain offeraunces every day. Also the word of the Lord
was showed to Jeremye on this manner. If it be possible my covenant to be broken
which I have smyten with the day and night: so that another ye day nor ye
night follow not in their time: so is it impossible my covenant to be void
which I have made with David my servant: and so not to have a son raigninge in
his seat. And even likewise shalnot my service lake Leuite and Preiste. Christ
was of ye sead of David both priest and m^nister aftir ye order of
Me^chisedech.


For as the stars of heaven cannot be nowbred / nor the sea sands mesured /
even so shall I increase the sead of my servant David / my Levites and
ministres. Over this yet came the word of ye Lord ageyn to Jeremy thus.
Understand thou not what this people says? There be two kynredis (say they)
whom ye Lord has chosen / and even these same both has he cast away (for
to this is my people brought that they believe themselves never to come in
together with the gentyles) wherefore thus says ye Lord. If I have not
smitten a barge^ with ye day and night. If I have not given laws to ye heaven
and earth: the sead of Jacob and David my servant now shall I cast away / so
that I receive not of his ysswe to be princes over the sead of Abraham / Isaac
and Jacob. For I shall repayer their fall and be merciful unto them.

The.xxxiiii. Chapter.
THe sermon which was showed of ye Lord unto Jeremy (when Nebuchadrezar king
of Babylon / with all his host gatherd from al ye regions of his land / that
were under his impery / and al his people made bataile agenste Jerusalem and her
cytes borderinge about her) one this manner. Thus commands the Cord God of
Israel. Go and speak to Zedechias king of Juda / and tell him: Thus says the
Lord. Lo / I shall betake this cite into the hand of the king of Babylon /
which shall set fire upon it: and thou thy self shall not escape his hand /
but be led captive and delyuerde into his power. Thy eyes shall behold the
present face of ye king of Babylon / and he shall speak unto the / mouth to
mouth: and than shall thou come to Babylon. But yet hear the word of the
Lord (Zedechias king of Juda) Thus ye Lord tells the. That thou shall not
be slain with sword / but thou shall dye in peace. For they shall burn ye in
the fire / as they burnt thy fathers ye kings thy predicessours. And shall
give the thy moorning tuwne / sayng. Ah Master. For this counsel have I taken
says the Lord. And the Prophet Jeremy spoke unto Zedechie king of Juda al
these sermons at Jerusalem / when the king of Babylons host laid sege to
Jerusalem and to all the other cytes of Juda that were left / as to lachis and
Azecham which yet remained of ye sironge defensed cytes of Juda. The sermon
which ye Lord sh^^wed to ye Prophet Jeremye / aftir yt Zedechias had made a
law with all the people of Jerusalem: that lybertye and fredome should be
proclaimed / so that every man should let fre go his bond servant yt were
hebrews / both man and w^man / and no jew to suffer his brother to be his
bondeman. And al ye rulers with the hole people yt moved this bargen / consented
that every man should let go free both bond man and woman / and no more to be
lordis over them. And agreyng to this law / they obayed and consented /
sending them for the fre. But aftir ward they repented them / and plucked
their bond men and maid seruantis home ageyn whom they had let go free / and
called them ageyn into bondage. For the which cause ye word of the lord was
showed from him unto Jeremy thus. Thus says ye lord god of Israel. I made a
covenant with your fathers wha^ I led the^ forth of ye land of Egypt / that
they should no more live in bondage / with these wordis. At the seven years end
/ let every man let go free his bond servant that is an Hebrew and bought /
aftir has served vi. year / let him go free. But your fathers obayed me not
(...) yet herkened to me. And ye were (...) turned / doing that just and
right (...) in my sight / every man proclayming fredome to his neghbour /
smyting ye bargen in my presence / even in the temple which bears my name.
But your myndis sone changed / ye have defiled my name / every man calling
home agein / his bond man and maid whom ye had once let go free at their own
lybertye. Wherefore this is the lordis pleasure / saying. ye obayed me not / when
eueryman proclaimed lyberty to his brother and neghbour / wherefore I my self
shall call you unto a lybertye says the lord: eue^ into ye lybertye of the
sword / pestelence and honger. Theryte of co^uena^ts to be confirmed then
both with Iwes and ge^tyls
And I shall deliver you for the to be vexed of al nations of ye earth: even
these men which have broken my bargen not observing the wordis of the covenant
smiten in my presence (the bullok cleft in twayn: and the goinge through between
the parts thereof solempnly done) even the rulers (I say) of Juda / ye rulers
of Jerusalem with their geldid men / the priestis and all the people of ye land
which passed through between the two sides of this bullok / I shall betake into
the power of their enimes which long to draw out their hertis. And their
karions shall be meat for the fowls of the air and beastis of the earth. And as
for Zedechias king of Juda and her rulers / I shall deliver them into their
enimes handis which thirste for their life / even into the handis of the king
of Babylons host: which now goithe away from you / but at my beck / (says
ye Lord) he shall return unto this cite / which wone and taken / they shall
set on fire. And the cytes of Juda / I shall leave desolate noman to inhabit them.

The.xxxv. Chapitre.
THe sermon showed of the Lord unto Jeremy / in the reign of Joachim the sone
of Josias king of Juda / on this manner. Go to the house of the Rechabites /
and call them forth / and bring them to the house of the Lord into some of
ye reuestrys / and give them wine to drink.

Then took I Jazaniam the sone of Jeremy the sone of Habaznie / and his
brethren with all his chylderne and all the famylye of ye Rechabites / and
brought them to ye house of the Lord into the reuestrye of ye chylderne of
Hanan son of Igdalie the man of God / which reuestry was by the reuestry of
the rulers: this was over the vestry of Maasie son of Sallum chief of the
tresure house. And I set before ye sons of the famylye of the Rechabites /
tankerdis full of wine and cups / and bad them drink wine. ^f the ^echa^tesfa
^er re^e ye.iiii ^^ke of ^e kin^s ca^.x.
And they answerde / we drink no wine. For Jonadab our father the sone of
Rechab commanded us sayng. Drink never no wine / another you nor your sons.
Bilde no houses / sow no corn: Also ye shall nether plant nor possede any
vyneyardes: but dwell ye in tentis al your life ye ye may live long upon ye
land wheryn ye be strangers. Wherefore we obayed the commandment of Jonadab
the son of our father Rechab in all that he bode us / so yt nether we / our
wives / our sons nor daughters drink wine al our lives / nor bylde us houses
to dwelyn another have we vynyardes nor corn feldis among us: but dwell in
tabernacles obayng and doing to our power al yt our father Jonadab bode us. But
now it chaunsed so / yt when Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon came up into this
province / we comoned together saying. Let us go to Jerusalem yt we might
escape ye host of ye Chaldes and Assyrio^s. Wherefore we dwell now in houses here
in Jerusalez. Tha^ came ye word of ye lord to Jeremy sayng Thus says the
lord of powers ye god of Israel. Go and say unto al Juda and to ye cytes of
Jerusalez. Will ye receive no disciplyne yt ye might obaye my wordis says ye
Lord? The wordis of Jonadab / sone of Rechab commanding his chylderne to drynk
no wine stand fast / for they drynk non unto this day / but obayed ye
precept of their father. But I meselfe have spoken to you both erly rising and
diligently warning and yet obayed ye not me: over all this / I sent you al my
serua^tis / ye prophetis / both erly rysinge / over sendinge and saying. Lome
ageyn (I pray you) every man from his own ill way and turn your minds into a
better state / and go not thus away aftir strange goddis to worship the^ yt ye
might abide still in this land which I gave you and your fathers: but ye gave
no ear nor obayed me. The childerne of Jonadab / sone of Rechab kept fast
their fathers precepte which he gave thez: but this people obayed not me.
Wherefore ye Lord God of powers the God of Israel commands me thus to say.
Lo / I shall bring al thaffli^^io^s upon Juda and upon all the cytesens of
Jerusalem / which I have decreed agenste them. For I spoke to them / but they
obayed me not. I called them / but they answerde not. Than said Jeremy unto the
familye of the Rechabites. Thus says ye Lord of powers the God of Israel. For
yt ye obayed the commandment of Jonadab your father and kept al his preceptis
doing aftir al yt he body you: therefore thus says the Lord of powers the God
of Israel. The stok of Jonadab son of Rechab shall not be with out a man to
continewe and stand in my presence for ever.

The.xxxvi. Chapter.
THe fowerth year of Joachim the son of Josias king of Juda: thus did the
Lord his word unto Jeremy sayng. Take the a great book and write therein all the sermons which I have spoken unto the to be preched unto Israel / Juda /
and to al nations: sense I begane to fpeke with the in the raygne of Josias /
unto this present day: If paraduenture yet the house of Juda hearing / al
these affliccions wiche I purpose to do to them / turn every man from his evil
way / and I forgive them their wykednes and sin. Then Jeremy called to him
Baruch the sone of Nerie: And Baruch did write in the book / at the mouth of
Jeremy all the sermons of the Lord spoken unto Jeremy. And Jeremy commanded
Baruch sayng. It is not suer for me to come into the house of the Lord. Go
thou therefore / and read this book written of my mouth / the very wordis of the
Lord / all the people hearing it in the day of the fast / and al Juda hearing
it to / ye and even unto them to that are comen hither from their cytes shall
thou read the^. If paraduenture they will submit their prayers unto the
presence of ye Lord / and so return every man from his euelwaye. For great is
the wrath and indignacion ordened of God for this people. Then did Baruch the
sone of Nerie to his power all that Jeremy the Prophet commanded him reding of
the book the sermons of the Lord / in the house of the Lord. And this was
done the fyfte year of Joachim sone of Josias king of Juda in the nyenthe
month when they commanded all the people to fast to pease the Lord: It wa^
noue^^ byr.
as wet the people of Jerusalem as them that came thither from the other cytes.
Then did Baruch read on the book / Jeremyes sermons at the house of the Lord /
standing in the vestry of Gamarie sone of Saphan the scrybe: which vestry is
by the over vestry before the new door of the temple / all the people hering
them. And when Micheas / sone of Gamarie the sone of Saphan had herd all the
sermons of the Lord out of the book: He went down to the kings house unto
the scrybes counting house. For there sat the rulers / Elisama scrybe / Dalias
sone of Semei / Elnathan the sone of Achbori / Gamarias sone of Saphan /
Zedechias sone of Hanany with all the rulers. And Micheas told them all the
sermons which he had herd of Baruch red out of the book / all the people
hearing. And all the rulers sent Jehudi the sone of Nathany sone of Salamy sone
of Chusi unto Baruch on message saying. Take the book in thy hand where upon
thou reddist / the people hering the / and come thy wais with me.

Then took Baruch the sone of Nery the book in his hand and came to them. And
they said unto him. Sit down (I pray the) and read / and let us here them.

And Baruch red them / they herkening thereunto: And when they had herd al
these sermons / they were astonned one gasyng upon a another / sayng unto Baruch
/ verily we shall show ye king al these wordis. And they asked Baruch thus.
Tell us I pray ye how thou wrotest al these sermons of his mouth? Whom Baruch
answerde: he spoke the^ to me with his own mouth / which I alone being with
him received with my pen into this book. Then said ye rulers unto Baruch. Go
and hyde ye with Jeremy so that noman know where you be. And these rulers went
in to ye court to the king leuing ye book in Elisams ye scrybis study / and
told all the sermons unto the kingis presence. Then sent ye king one Jehudi
to fetch ye book: which brought from Elisams the scrybis study: and Jehudi
had red it / both the king himself and all the rulers present hering it. The
king then abode in his winter house: for it was then nouembyr / and there was a
great fire before him: And when Jehudi had red three or four leaves / the book
was cut in pesis with a pen knyfe and cast into the fire upon the harthe till
all the book was burnt up: notwithstanding yet in the mean ceason / they
nether fered nor cut their clothes / another the king himself nor his
seruantis when they had herd al these sermons. But Elnathan / Dalias / and
Gamarias made intercession to the king that the book should not have had been
burnt / but he herd them not: but commanded Jerachmiel the sone of Hameleche
/ Sarie the sone of Ezriel and Salamie sone of Achdiel to take Baruch / yt
wrote it / and Jeremy the Prophet to. But the Lord had hid them. Than came
the word of the Lord to Jeremy / aftir the king had bre^te the book with the
sermons which Baruch had written at the mouth of Jeremy. The word of the Lord
came to Jeremy on this manner. yet agene take the a another book / and write in
it all the forsayde sermons which were in the book before: which Joachim king
of Juda bre^te: And tell Joachim king of Juda. Thus says the Lord: Thou have
burnt this book / thus reuoluinge in thy mind. For what intent haste thou
written in it this matter: that the king of Babylon shall come and subuerte this
land? and that he should leave it desolate both man and beast? Wherefore the
Lord says as concerning Joachim king of Juda. There shall non of his stock
sit in the sete of David. His carkase shall be cast agenste the heat of the
day and cold of the night. And I shall look upon the wikednes both of him / of
his sede / and of his seruantis: and bring upon them and the inhabitours of
Jerusalem and upon al Juda / all that great affliccion which I told the^
before / al beit they herd me not. Then Jeremy took a another book / and gave
it to Baruch the scrybe sone of Nery / which wrote in it at Jeremyes mouth al
ye sermons of the same book that Joachim king of Juda had burnt: moreover
there were added unto them moo then before.

The.xxxvii. Chapter.
ZEdechias the sone of Josias / made king of Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon /
reigned over the land of Juda / in the stead of Jechonias sone of Joachim sone
of Joachim. But nether he / nor his serua^tis / nor the people of the land
obayd the sermons of the Lord which he spoke by Jeremy ye Prophet. Nethelesse
yet was king Zedechias feign to send Jehuchal sone of Selemy and Zephaniam
sone of Maasy Priest unto the Prophet Jeremy / that they should say to him.
Pray for us unto our Lord God we beseech the. For Jeremy went freely among
the people / not yet put in preson. But now was Pharaous host come out of
Egypt: who^ when ye Caldeis now layng sege to Jerusalem perceived / they went
bake from the cite. And then was the word of God showed unto Jeremy the
Prophet on this manner: Thus says the Lord God of Israel: These thing is shall
ye answer the king of Juda which sent you to inquire it of me. Behold
Pharaous host which came forth to help you / shall turn home again into
Egypt: and the Caldes shall come hither again / and wyn and take this cite and
set fire on it: For so says the Lord: Let it not synke in to your hertis to
think thus. Now ar the Caldes douteles gone away from us. For I ensuer you
they shall come agene. For albe it / ye had slain al ye Caldes host yt
fightith yet agenste you / so that very few of them / and that wounded to /
had been yet left each man in his tente / yet should these rise and burn up
this cite. And when the Caldes host was removed from Jerusalem for fere of
the Egypcians host: Jeremy went out of Jerusalem to go unto the land of
Benjamin to set an order among his kynsfolke. And when he came to the gate
called Beniamins gate / there was a certain man / chief of the ward or watch
called Jerias sone of Selemy the sone of Hanany / which took him imputing unto
him that he would have slipte from them to the Caldes. Which thing Jeremy said
was false / sayng I intended no thing less then to fle to the Caldes. Whom
Jerias would not believe: but took Jeremy and led him unto the rulers. And the
rulers being angry with Jeremy / beit him and thrusted him into presone at
Jonathan the scrybs house: for this man was the leiftenant of the presone. And
so was Jeremy let down into a deep donge^ and there laid in stockis a long
ceason. Then sent king Zedechias and called him forth to him asking him
secretly at home in his house sayng: Think thou yt this besegynge of this
cite now in doing is done of the Lord? And Jeremy answerde: ye. adding also /
yt thou shall be delyuerde into the handis of the king of Babylon. And over
this / Jeremy said unto king Zedechias: What have I offended either the / or
thy seruantis / or this people that ye have thus cast me into presone? Where be
your Prophetis that told you: the king of Babylon should not come agenst you /
nor yet once in to this land? Now therefore harken my lord the king / hear my
peticion I beseech your favor / that ye command me no more to be led again to
the house of Jonathan the scrybe / lest I there dye. Then king Zedechias
commanded Jeremy the Prophet to be shut but in ye fore entry of the presone
/ and to be given him every day a little cake of bread with out any other
soden or roasted mete till all the bread in the cite were consumed. Then there
lay Jeremy in the enter of the presone.

The.xxxviii. Chapter.
THen Saphathias sone of Mathan / Godolias sone of Phashur / Juchal sone of
Salamie / and Passhur sone of Malechy the rulers / understanding Jeremyes
sermons spoken unto the people in this sense: Thus says the Lord / who so ever
shall abide still in this cite / shall dye either with sword / or honger / or
pestelence. But whosoever go forth unto ye Caldes shall live and save themself
fynding their life as a proye. For thus said the Lord. This cite shall be given
up in to the handis of the king of Babylon which shall take it. Wherefore these
rulers said unto the king: let this man be put to death we pray you. For by
this means he both slacketh the handis of the soudyers and discourageth the
men now ready to fight left in this cite / and discorageth all the people while
he precheth siche manner sermons. For he nether seeks peace for the people but
rather death. Than answerde king Zedechias. Lo he is in your handis / for your
king may not deny you any siche thing. Then took they Jeremy and cast him
into the donge^ of Malchy the sone of Hamalech which before was in the fore
entrye of ye preson. And they let down Jeremy with ropes into a dongen where was
no water but myer. And Jeremy was rolled and set fast in the myer. And when
Abdemeleche ye Ethyope / a gelded man and offycer in ye kingis house herd that
they had cast Jeremy into this doungen / he went from the kingis place and
spoke to the king which then chanced to sit in judgment in Beniamyns gate /
these wordis: Lord my king / it is not rightwysely done yt these men have
done to Jeremy ye Prophet in that they have cast him in to this dongen / for
he shall storue in this same place for honger / since there is no bread left in
ye cite. Then the king bode this Addemelech thethiope sayng: Take we the from
hence at thy pleasure xxx. men / and pluck up the Prophet Jeremy from out of
the dongen ere he dye. Then took Abdemelech these men with him / and went to
Hamalechis house / where under an aumbry he got old clowtis and raggis / and
let them down to Jeremy with cordis into the dongen. And Abdemelech ye
Ethiope called to Jeremy bidding him put these rote^ clowtis under his arm
holis between the rope and his body. And Jeremy so did / and then they lifted
hem up and drew him out of the dongen / and then he abode still in the fore
entrye of the presone. Tha^ sent king Zedechias and called the Prophet Jeremy
before him unto the third ward which was by the house of ye Lord. And ye
king said to Jeremy. I will ask the a thing / so yt thou hydest nothing fro
me. And Jeremy answerde Zedechias. If I tell it the / thou wylt suerly slay me.
And if I give ye counsel / thou shall not here me. Then king Zedechias made an
oath secretly to Jeremy in these wordis. As verily as the Lord lives / even
he which has made us these souls: I swear that I will not slaye the: nether
will I deliver the into the handis of these men that thirste for thy life. Than
said Jeremy unto Zedechas. Eue^ thus says the lord God of powers ye God of
Israel: If thou go forth at once with out any stop yelding thy self unto
the princes of the king of Babylon: thou shall save thy life: and this cite
shall not be burnt up with fire / and thou shall be salfe with al thy house. But if
thou will not fle to ye king of Babylons princes: this cite shall be given up
into ye handis of ye Caldes which shall set fire on it. And thou thy self shall
not escape their handis. Tha^ said Zedechias to Jeremy. I fere these iwes which are fled al ready to ye Caldes lest I be betrayed into their ha^dis and they
laughed me to scorn. Jeremy answerde / they shalnot betraye ye. Believe (I pray
ye) the voice of the Lord which I tell the / and thou shall be well enough and
have thy life. But if thou refusest utterly to go for the: eue^ this thing
has ye Lord showed me. Lo / al ye women left in ye kingis house of Juda /
shall go forth to ye princes of the king of Babylon: For they are persuaded ye
thou ar deceived in yt thou trustest so miche ye men which have ruled the.
They / in whom thou didist put al thy trust / have set thy fete fast in ye
myer to leave ye be hynde. Wherefore / al thy wives with their chyldern will fle
to the Caldes: and thou shall not escape their handis. For thou shall be taken
captyue in ye ki^ge of Babylons ha^dis / and thy cite bre^t up. The^ said
Zedechias unto Jeremy. Let noma^ know these thingis / and thou shall not dye.
But if ye rulers perceive yt I have comoned with ye / and so come to ye / sayng:
Tell us (we pray the) what wordis thou haddist with the king / hid nothing from
us / and we wilnot slaye ye asking what the king said to the: thou shall
answer thez: I made my supplicacion unto him / sith I am thus cast away /
prayng the king that I might no more be led again to Jonathas his house lest
I there dye: Then came the rulers to Jeremy asking him / and he told them al
as the king had commanded him. Whom as soon as he had thus answerde / they
held their peace. For they knew nothing of the matter. Then abode Jeremy still
in then try of the presone until ye same day that Jerusalem was taken. And all this was done while Jerusalem was in beseging and taking.

The.xxxix. Chapter.
FOr in the nynthe year of king Zedechias of Juda the.x. month came
Nebuchadnezar Decembyr.
king of Babylon with all his host unto Jerusalem and beseged it. And in
the.xi. year of Zedechias the.iiii. month the nynth day of the monithe be
broke in to the cite / and all the rulers and cheiftens of the king of Babylon
came in and sat down together in judgment in the open gate / as Nergal /
Garezer / Samgarnebo / Sarsechim / Rabsaris / Nergal / Sarezaer / Babinag /
with all the other kingis of Babylonis rulers and capitayns. Whom when Zedechias
king of Juda saw: he with all his host fled and co^uayed themselves out of
the cite be night through ye kingis back ortcharde and so through at a preuy
gate between two wallis / and went for the towerde the deserte. But the Caldes
host persued upon them / and took Zedechias in the plain of Jericho / and
brought him to Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon in Riblatham in the land of
Hamathe. Where the king laid sore to Zedechias his charge in judgment. And
Zedechias sons slain in the sight of their father in Riblatham / the king
of Babylon (after he had slain also all the nobles of Juda) he put out
Zedechias eyes: and his fete bownde together / sent him to Babylon. And the
kings palace with ye wother come^s houses / the caldes brent up / and threw
down the wallis of Jerusalem. And the people left in the cite / with them to
that fled to him for socour the rest of the comens / Nebuzar Adan chieften of
ye host translated unto Babylon. But the raskal and pore forlorn wretches
this Nebuzar Adan chieften left still in the land of Juda / and diuyded among
them the vynyardis and feldis the same time. But Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon
/ as co^cerninge Jeremy / commanded Nebuzar Adan their cheiften on this manner.
Take him to the and be favorable to him / and se thou doiste him no harm /
but what so ever he asks of the / let him have it. The^ Nebuzar Adan the
archeiften of the host / Nebusasban chieften of the geldedmen and Nergal
Sarezer chief auditour with al the other officers and rulers under the king of
Babylon / sent and called Jeremy from thentrye of the presone and committed
him unto Gedolias seen of Ahicam sone of Saphan that he should take him home to
his house / and so he dwelled and continued still abroad among the people. But
while Jeremy was shut in the^try of the presone / the word of ye Lord was
showed him on this manner. Go and tell Abdemelech thethiope: Thus says the Lord
of powrs ye god of Israel. Behold I shall bring to pass my purpose right
sharp suerly and nothing plesaunt which I have decreed upon this cite even
thissame day / thou seeing it: In which day / yet will I deliver ye / says
the Lord: so that thou shall not come into the handis of these men whom thou
ferest somyche. Undoubted I shall preserve the from the sword so that thy life
shall be a proye unto thyselfe because thou doist trust in me says the Lord.

The argument of the.xl. Chapter.
This Chapi. with certain other following declare the miserable end of the cite
now taken and the people overcome. For the ungracious reamnant were so tossed
about and discorded among them selves one betrayng a another: that the
prophecy of Moses as the lord thretened them was now verifyed on the^ / even
this: That they should be overcome and led captyue into their enymes land: he
would persecute them still with sword.

The.xl. Chapter.
HOw the Lord dealt with Jeremy aftir that Nabuzar Adan archeifte^ of the
host had delyuerd him from Ra^a / whither he had led him bownde among all the
other captynes of Jer^salem and Juda. This Nabuzaradan called Jeremy unto him
sayng. Thy Lord God testified fermely this same calamite to fall upon this
place: wherefore the Lord has brought it upon them and fynesshed it accordi^ge
to his word / because ye sinned against the Lord and obayed not his voice:
Wherefore this mysery is chanced unto you.

Now therefore / lo: I loose thy bondis which ar now upon thy handis: and if it
please the to go with me to Babylon / come: for I will chourisshe the and se
thou want nothing. And if it like the not to go with me: me: abide here still.
Behold all this land is at thy pleasure / dwell in it where it like the best /
and it like the not to dwela broad alone: go dwell with Gedolias sone of Ahicam
sone of Saphan whom the king of Babylon has made gouerner over the cite of
Juda / and abide with him among the people / or else where so ever it please the.
And the archeiften of the host gave him mete and drink and rewardis and let
him go. Then went Jeremy unto Gedoliam sone of Ahika^ unto Masphat / and dwelt
with him among the other people left in the land. And when it came to the ears
of all the pety capitayns in Juda dispe^sed with their fellows through the felds
that the king of Babylon had made Gedolia^ son of Ahikam ruler of the land /
and that men women and chyldern with the pore men of the land which were not
led captyue to Babylon / al should be under his dominion: they came to Gedoliam
in Masphat. There came Ismael the sone of Nathanie / Johanna and Jonathan sons
of Care / Saraias son of Thanhumeth / and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite
/ Zemeias sone of Maachathi with their felaws. And Gedolias sone of Ahikam sone
of Saphan swore both to them and to their felows in this manner. Fere not to
serve the Caldes / dwell ye still in this land / and serve the king of Babylon
/ and ye shall prosper. For I meselfe lo / dwell in Masphat to govern and be head
in the Caldeis name to answer and to content who so comes unto us. Go ye
therefore and gather your grapis to make wine / gather in your whete / corn /
and oil / and lay it up in your garners / and dwell still in your towns which
ye hold. Then all the Iwes being among the Moabites and Ammonitis in Idumea and
in all these regions understanding that the king of Babylon had given Gedolia^
sone of Ahikam sone of Saphan to be ruler of the reamnant left in Juda
returned from every place whither they had fled before / and came into the
land of Juda unto Gedoliam in Masphat and gatherd grapis and great plently of
corn. Then came Johanna the sone of Caree and all the pety capitayns dispersed
through the region unto Gedolias in Masphat sayng unto him: know thou not how
Baalis king of Ammon has sent Ismael sone of Nathany to slaye the? And yet
Gedolias believed them not. And Johanna sone of Lare said unto Gedolias preuyly
in Masphat these wordis: Will thou that I go and slaye Ismael sone of Nathanie
so yt none be aware of it? wherefore should he slaye the and the Iwes also
which be gatherd unto the / to scater the^ away and so the rest of Juda
utterly to perysshe? And Gedolias sone of Ahikam said unto Johanna sone of
Cart. Se thou doist it not / for they be but lies that are told of Ismael.

The.xli. Chapter.
IN the seventh month came Ismael ye sone of Nathanie sone of Elisame / which
was of the kingis blood with the gretest about the king and with x. mo of their
conspyred accomplices unto Gedolias sone of Ahikam in Masphat where they sat
down to meat altogether. And Ismael the sone of Nathany start up with his.x.
conspyred accomplices that were with him / and smote Gedolias sone of Ahikam sone
of Saphan with his sword. And so slew they him whom ye king of Babylon had
made ruler of the land. And Ismael also slew al ye Iwes that were with
Gedolias in Masphat and the Chaldes there left to assiste him. And it came to
pass yt the next day following the death of Gedolias which yet was kept
secret: there came certain men from Sichem / from Silo and Samary.lxxx. in
nowmber their heads clipped / their clothes cut al sad and kareful bringing
gifts and sense in their handis to offer them up in the house of ye Lord. And
Ismael the sone of Nathany going forth of Masphat met them coming a great
pase wepinge. And when he met them / he said: Go your ways to Gedoliam sone of
Ahika^. And when they were comen into the mids of the cite: Ismael sone of
Nathany with his coniured slew them by the middis of the dyke or lake. And
among these.lxxx. me^: there werten that said to Ismael: slay us not / for we
have tresur in the fel^e / both whete / barley / oil and honey. Then he
spared them / and slew them not with their brothern. And the lake into which
Ismael threw the bodies of the slain whom he slew for Gedolias sake / was ye
same which king Asa made for fere of Baase king of Israel / ye same lake
Ismael filled with the carkasis. And he led away captive al ye rest of ye
people / as the kings daughters with all the people left in Masphat: over whom
Nebuzaradan tharehieften had set Gedolias ruler. And Ismael took the^ al and
went his way to go to the Ammonitis. Then Johanna the sone of Caree and all the
pety capitayns over the company hering all this mischief that Ismael had done /
took al their company and went forth to fight with Ismael sone of Nathany /
and fownde him at ye waters of Rabim which arin Gabaon. And when all the people
led captyue with Ismael saw Johan the sone of Caree with all these pety
capitayns and their company / they were glad. There brought they again all the
people that Ismael had carried from Masphat / which returned / came to Johan ye
sone of Caree. But Ismael escaped with.viii. of his co^iured from the face of
Johan / and went to tha^monitis. Then Johan sone of Caree and al his capitayns
/ took all this rest of the people who^ they reskewed and took from Ismael
carried fro Masphat aftir the death of Godolias / which were men valeau^t in
batail / their wives / chyldern and geldedmen whom they brought again from
Gabaon / and went and sat down in Geruth Chimham which place is by Bethlehe^
/ entending so to goforthe into Egypt for fere of the Caldes / whom they fered
for this cause / that Ismael had slain Gedolias sone of Ahika^ / who^ the
king of Babylon had made ruler and ouerseer of the land.

The.xlii. Chapter.
THen came al these gonerners / as Johan sone of Caree / Jezanias sone of Hosie
and all the people from the least to the most sayng unto Jeremy the Prophet.
Here our peticion (we beseech ye) that is / pray for us unto thy Lord God for all this remnaunt here left of so many / which are now very few (as thou seist
us) that thy Lord God would show us what way we might go / and what we
might do. Whom Jeremy the Prophet answerde. I have he^de you effectuouly. Lo
/ I shall pray unto your Lord God according to your desyer. And what so ever
the Lord answer you / I shall show it you / hyding nothing from you. Then said
these men unto Jeremy. The Lord of truth and faith be our witness / if we do
not aftir every word which thy Lord God shall answer concerning us / be it
good or ill. The voice of our Lord God unto whom we send the / we shall here:
that we might prosper if we obaye the voice of our Lord God. Aftir x. days
the word of the Lord came to Jeremy. And then he called Johan the sone of
Caree and all the headis of the company that were with him / with all the people
from ye lest unto the most and told them. Thus spoke ye Lord God of Israel
unto who^ ye sent me to lay forth your prayers before him. If ye will dwell
still in this land / I shall encrese you and not destroy you / plant you / and
not pluck / you up by the rotis. For I am well apayed and peased as towching the
affliccion which I decreed upon you. Fere no more the king of Babylon / whom
ye yet fere / and need not says the Lord. For I shall be with you to save and
deliver you from his hand. I will forgive and be merciful unto you and bring
you again in to your own land. But if ye wilnot set your myndis at rest to
dwell still in this land / not abaying the voice of your Lord God / sayng let
us not abide here / but go into ye land of Egypt / where we shall se no war
nor here of any pealis to batayl / nor suffer any honger / there let us dwell.
Wherefore here the word of the Lord ye reamnant of Juda. Thus spoke the Lord
of powers the God of Israel. If ye be full bente to go into Egypt / there to be
in exyle: it shall come to pass that the sword which ye now fere shall over
take you in Egypt: and the honger that ye here fere / shall cleue upon you even
into Egypt / there to dye. For as many as shall set their faces fermely bente
thitherwarde there to case their exyle or banishment / shall dye with sword
honger and pes^elence. There shall not one of them escape the plage which I shall
bring upon them. For thus says the lord of powers the God of Israel. Like as
my wrath and furye did flowforthe upon the inhabitours of Jerusalem: even so
shall it flowforthe over you if ye go into Egypt. For ye shall be an execracion /
a wondering stock / detested / reuyled and in obprobry to men / never more to
se this land agene. It is the Lord that bids you (Oh reamnaunt of Juda)
that ye go not into Egypt / and that ye forget not what he has testified unto
you this day. For ye should trappe your own selves. For ye sent me to your
Lord God sayng. Pray our Lord God for us: And what so over our Lord God
answer / tell us: and we will do it. Now therefore have I showed you the voice
of your Lord God: for the which thing he has sent me unto you: and yet
will ye not obaye. Be ye suer therefore to dye with sword / honger and
pestilence in that same place which delight you so gretely to fle unto.

The.xliiii. Chapter.
ANd aftir that Jeremy had left preching to all the people / al these wordis of
the Lord God: for whose cause he sent him to them: Azarias sone of Holy / and
Johan sone of Caree with all that heady presumptuouse people said unto Jeremy.
Thou lie unto us: nether has our Lord God sent the to command us that we
go not into Egypt to dwell there. But Baruch the sone of Nery has let the slip
among us to betraye and deliver us into the power of ye Babylonytis to lead us
captive to Babylon there to slaye us. And this Johan ye sone of Caree with all
the captins of the host and all the people / obayd not ye lordis wordis that
they should dwell still in the land of Juda. Then took Johan sone of Caree and
all the cheiftens of the multitude and led a way all the remnant of Juda which
were now come to gither again from all the nations among whom they had
benscatred / to dwell agene in the land of Juda as strangers: they took and led
away (I say) men women and chylderne / the kingis daughters / and al them
that Nebuzaradan tharchieften had left with Gedoliam sone of Ahikam sone of
Saphan: They took also Jeremy ye Prophet and Baruch the sone of Nery and came
into Egypt. For they obayd not ye lordis voice. And they came into Thaphnis:
and in Thaphnis ye word of ye lord was showed unto Jeremy sayng. Take in thy
hand great stones and hyde them in an hole in ye grownde by the brik wall
under the door of Pharos house in Thaphnis in ye sight of the men of Juda sayng
unto them. Thus says the Lord of powers the God of Israel. Behold I shall
send and call hither Nebuchadrezar my servant king of Babylon / and set his
trone upon these stones which I have hid / which shall bend his tente over
them. For he shall come and plage the land of Egypt: some with slaughter /
some with captivity / and some with sword: he shall set fire on the temples of
the Goddis of Egypt and burn them up / and hold their godis captive. And ye
land of Egypt aftir this shall clothe hirselfe as the herdeman puts on his
clothes to get him hence in peace. Also he shall alto break the pilers of the
temple of the son in Egypt and the temples of the Gods of Egypt / he shall
consume with fire.

The.xliiii. Chapter.
THe sermon showed unto Jeremye / upon all the Jews yt dwelt in Egypt in Migdalo
/ in Thaphna / in Memphi and in the land of patheres on this manner. Thus says
the Lord of powers the God of Israel ye have seen al ye miserable calamite
which I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cytes of Juda how they be
desolate unto this day no man dwelling in them / and that even for their
sins which they committed provoking my wrath while they went and kindled
their fyers worshipping strange gods / which nether they their selves knew /
nor yet you / nor your fathers. Albeit yet I sent them al my serua^tis the
Prophetis erly rising continually sendinge and mou^sshing in time sayng. Se (I
pray you) that ye commit not this abominacion which I aborre so gretely /
and yet they obayd not / nor once moved their ears to them / to go from their
myscheife no more to kindle their fyers before these strange gods. Wherefore my
hot indignacion and wrath was kindled and burned up their cytes and feldis
with the stretis of Jerusalem: and so were they made desolate and forsaken as ye
may se even this day. Now therefore says ye Lord of powers the God of Israel.
Wherefore do ye so great wykednes agenst your own selves to spill your men and
women soukelingis and infantis of Juda / so that ye shall at last leave none a
live while ye provoke me to anger with ye workis of your own handis kindlinge
lyghtis unto strange Gods in ye land of Egypt into which ye ar gone to dwell
in to be clean cut away / execrable / accursed and ignominiouse among al ye
nations of ye earth. Remember ye not ye sins of your fathers? ye sins of ye
kingis of Juda / and of their wives? your own sins and your wives? which ye
committed in ye land of Juda both in the field and stretis of Jerusalem? And
yet be ye not sorye or humbled unto this day / ye fere not / ye walk not in
my law and preceptis which I gave both to you / and your fathers. Werfore
thus says ye Lord of powers ye God of Israel Behold I am fermely decreod to
scourge you and to pluckup al Juda by ye rotes: and take ye reamnaunt of Juda
ye bente their faces so stifeneckedly to enter into Egypt / there to dwell and
take their plesures. And they shall be al wasted away / they shall be al smyten
down in ye land of Egypt / and consumed with sword and honger. From the least to ye gretest shall they dye with sword and honger. They shall be an
execracion / aborred / wondered at / curssed and into obprobrye. For I shall so
vyset thinhabitours of ye land of egypt / as I have visited Jerusalem with swerd
honger and pestelence / that of all the remnaunt of Juda which went into Egypt
there to dwell / shall be none left salfe to return into ye land of Juda /
although their minds was to come agene: yet shall there none return but siche
as shall fle and escape. Then al these men which were preuye to their wives
sacryfiyng unto strange gods and all the women there present in the hole
multitude / and all the people to / that there dwelled in Egypt in the cite of
patheres / answered Jeremy on this manner. The sermon which thou madist unto us
in the name of the Lord / in nomaner wise will we receive / but we will do what
so ever goith forth of owr own mouth / whether it be sacrifising unto the
queen of heaven / or offering any other oblacion / like as both we and our
fathers have done before us / as well our kingis and rulers both in the cytes
of Juda / as well with out as with in Jerusalem. For then had we plenty of
food / then were we happy and saw no plagis. But as soon as we ceased from
sacrificing to the queen of heaven and from giving her gyftis: we were nedy of
al thingis and consumed with sword and honger. And last of al: when we women
did sacrifice to ye queen of heaven giving her giftis: did we then make her kake
bread housbandlesse / and offered to her lyquet sacryfices to provoke her to
anger? Then said Jeremy unto all the people / to men and women and all the comens
that answered him on this manner. Remembered not the Lord / the facrifices which
ye offered in the cytes of Juda and Jerusalem both with in and with out / both
you and your fathers / both your kingis and rulers and the people of ye land?
Did he not reuolue them in his mind? And the Lord could suffer no longer your
maliciouse thoughtis and abominacio^s which ye committed. Was not your land
therefore made desolate / forsaken and so detestable that no man may dwell in it
unto this day? And even for this cause / that ye sacrificed and sinned agenst
the Lord / not obaing his voice yt ye might have had walked in his law / his
ordina^cis / and testimonis / for these causes / I say / these affliccio^s and
plages came upon you / as this day well witnesses. Morouer Jeremy added unto
all the people and all the women these wordis. Here ye the word of the Lord al
Juda which ar in ye land of Egypt. For thus says the Lord of powrs the God
of Israel / you and your wives have spoken ye thing with your mouths which
ye have accomplesshed with your dedis: sayng we will with out any stop do our
own decreed plesures which we have vowed / that is to wite to do sacrifice
unto ye queen of heaven and power her forth lyquet sacrifices before her: thus
stoutely have ye set up your own set plesures and with out any refrain have
ye fin^sshed your own vows. Wherefore here ye the word of the Lord al Juda
which dwell in ye land of Egypt. Behold / I have sworn by my nowne name yt
is so great / says ye Lord. My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any
man of Juda / yt he may say in all ye land of Juda. The Lord God lives. For
I shall be their watch man to scourge and not to defend the^ yt they might
rest. And al Juda shall be consumed which is in ye land of Egypt with sword
and honger till they be clean gone. And they yt shall escape ye sword shall
return from Egypt unto ye land of Juda: but these shall be very few. And ye
remnau^t of Juda come^ into ye land of Egypt there to be strangers shall know
whose wordis abide most certain and trwe of theirs or mine. And take this for
a toke^ among you. That I will vyset you in this same land / yt ye may know
certainly yt I will stablisshe my purpose as towchi^g your affliccio^. Lo / I
shall deliver up Pharao Haphraz ki^ge of Egypt into ye power of his enymes which
thirste for his life: eue^ as I delivered up zedechias king of Juda into ye
ha^dis of Nebuchadrezar ki^ge of Babylon / his enmy thirsti^g for his life.

The.xlv. Chapter.
THe wordis which Jeremy the Prophet spoke unto Baruch ye sone of Nery / when
he wrote these sermons in a book received at ye mouth of Jeremy / ye fowerth
year of Joachim sone of Josias king of Juda / on this manner. Thus says ye
lord God of Israel unto ye o Baruch. Thou saydst as thou wast in wrytinge. Ah
less for sorrow wretch yt I am: for ye Lord has sawced my labors with
sorrow and care / I labored with great desyer / and shall I find no rest? Thou
therefore Jeremy tell him thus. Thus says ye lord. Behold me / these thi^gis
which I have bylded / I shall cast down: and yt I have planted / I shall pluck
up by ye roots / eue^ all this same land: and gapest thou for any great
promocio^ or tobe magnified? Be not couetouse nor ambiciouse / for lo / I shall
bring a miserable calamite upon every man says the Lord: Nethelesse yet
shall thou enjoy thy life / and take it for a vau^tage. where so ever thou
becomest. Here follow the sermons of the Lord showed unto the Prophet Jeremy:
which he preched unto the gentylis.

The.xlvi. Chapter.
THis sermon following Jeremy preched unto the Egypcio^s / as concerning To the
Egyptians.
the host of Pharao Necho king of Egypt / when he was in Charchamis by ye
flowde Euphrates / where he was slain of Nebuchadrezer king of Babylon / the
fowerth year of Joachim sone of Jos^as king of Juda. ye make redye buckler and
shylde / and ye goforthe to fight: ye harnes your horse and lightvp on their
backis / oh horse men. ye set on fast your salettis / ye bring forth your
speres / ye skower your swerdis and clothe your selves with cotis of mayse. But
harken hoiwe seirs: wherefore seem ye to be afraid? shrink ye now back? ar
your valeaunt waryers thus slain? fle you so that none dare look back?
Tremblyng fere must cloose them in says ye Lord. The lightest of foot shall
not fle away / nor ye stro^gest shalnot escape. Northwarde by ye floude
Euphrates shall they be smyten down and fall al together. But who is this that
swelieth rising up like a flowde / roringe like a great rising water? They are
thegypcio^s that swell like a flowde casting out their stremes with so great
noise: for they say. Let us arise and kouer the land / let us destroy the
cytes with their inhabitours: Get ye to horse back / romble forth charietis:
Set forth ye strong waryers: ye Morians and Lybeons that bear shylde / and
ye Lydeons with your bows ready bente. But this same day shall be the day of
vengeance of the Lord God of powrs to take vengeance upon his enemes. The
sword shall devour themvp and be satisfied / it shall be bathed in their blood:
For the Lord God of powrs will make a sacrifyce north ward by ye flowde
Euphrates. Go up oh Galaad and bring medecynable rosen or triacle for the
virgen and daughter Egypt / but thou shall multiplye and make thy plasters in
vain. For the wounds cannot be closed up. The nations shall here of thy
ignomynye: and thy infamy shall fill all the land. For where one strong man
falls upon a another / shall they not come both down to gither? The sermon
spoken of the Lord unto the Prophet Jeremy / of the setting forth of
Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon to slaye and conquer the land of Egypt.
Shewsorth through Egypt and preche in Migdalo / Memphi and Taphna sayng.
Stand still and make thy self redye. For ye sword shall devour the in every
party. Wherefore ar thy valeaunte men fallne down? Wherefore stood they not
fast? For ye lord thrusted them down. Great was the slaughter: For one fill
upon a another while they stood taking their aduysment saying. Harken how
syers / let us return unto our own folk and natyue land from the edge of
the deuoweringe sword. Call hence king Pharao and tell him / oh Pharao king
of Egypt / this day will be thy confusion. As verily as I live / faith the
king whose name is ye Lord of powers: That Thabor stand not so fast among
the hills / another yet Carmelus recheth not so verily unto ye sea / as
thissame plage shall come. Make ye therefore (oh daughter inhabirres of Egypt)
vessels and packes to flit thy way. For Memphis shall be desolate and throne
down that noman inhabit her. Egypt is a fayer fat welthy bulloke: but there
shall come unto her a prodder with a prick from the north. Her hyerde soldyers
which are in her as fat as bullockis shall take the^ to their fete: nether shall
they stand and abide / for their slaughter day / and time of visitacio^
shall be present. The noise of their enymes shall sown in upon them as hard as
yerne. For they shall come with an host and down slayers with polaxes like tree
fellers: and hew down her wodes says ye Lord with out any stop or choice.
They shall excede ye swarmi^ge locuste flies and be innumerable. The daughter of
Egypt delyuerd up into ye power of ye people of ye north shall be ashamed. And
yetagayn says ye Lord of powrs the God of Israel. Behold I shall vyset the
pride of Alexa^drye / Pharao and Egypt / her gods and kings / eue^ Pharao and
the^ yt trust in him: And betake the^ into the power of the^ that seek their
lives / eue^ into ye handis of Nebuchadreser king of Babylon and of his
serua^tis. And aftir this it shall be inhabited as before says ye Lord. But
thou my servant Jacob fere not / nether dread thou Israel. For lo / I shall save
ye from a far and thy sede to / from ye land of their captivity. And Jacob
shall return and have rest / he shall be rich / noma^ to trowble him. Be not a
frayde my servant Jacob yet age^ I warn ye says ye Lord: For I am with ye /
and will make an end of al ye nations into among who^ I scatred ye: but of the
/ will I not make an end: but correcke the / and yt with discrecion / for in no
manner wise art thou innocent and fautelesse.

THe sermon of the Lord showed unto Jeremy the Prophet agenst the Palestyns
before Pharao won Gazam. Agenst ye Palestyns.
Thus said the Lord: Behold / waters shall come down from the north and
rise up into a flowde runninge over the land and all that is in it / and both
cytes and their inhabitours shall howl at the noise of the coming of the army
and stampinge of their barbed horses / at the shakinge of their charietis and
romblynge of their whelis. The fathers shall have no respect unto their
chylderne / their handis shall tremble for fere. And even the same time that he
shall be present to destroy al Palestyne with other eylandis divided from ye
land: there shall come a shauyng and chipping upon Gazam. Ascalon with her
other valis shall keep silence. Ah how long will thou slaye oh sword of the
Lord? How long shall it be ere thou cease? Return into thy sheath / rest
and cease. But how should it cease since the Lord has commanded it and
stered it up agenst Ascalon and other cytes upon the sea coostis?

Chapitre. xlviii.
AGenst Moab / thus spoke the Lord of powrs the God of Israel. Sitfast proud
Moab.
Woe be to Nebon / for it shall be subverted / she shall be ashamed and taken.
Beware / Rome.
Also that strong kiriatham shall be ashamed and afraid / she shall no more be the
gloriouse shyninge beutye of Moab. Upon Esebon shall there be taken shrewed
counsel / Come and let us cut her away from the nowmbir of the gentyls / so
that she be never more spoken of / the sword shall so persecute her. There shall
a voice cry from horonaim: Destroy and kill. And Moab is alto destroyed / an
out cryinge shall be herd through her villages. For weping and waylinge shall sty
up over all the hanging of the hill of luhit: and this cruel noise of
destruction shall come down and be herd unto Horonaim / fle / save your lives:
And even unto ye very haith of the deserte be ye like. Because thou didist
trust in thy strong defensed holdis and tresure / thou shall be taken away
to. A deuowering v^ciouse god.
Chamos shall be carried into captivity / both preistis and rulers al together:
And the destroyer shall come unto every cite / none shall escape. Dales shall
perisshe / and feldis shall be destroyed / as ye Lord has decreed. Lift up a
sign unto Moab that she may fle away swiftly: her cytes shall be so desolate
that noman may dwell in them. Cursed be he that shall do this work of the Lord
deceytfully or negligently.
And cursed be he that holds back his sword from blood. Full rich and suer
has Moab ben even from her yougthe / and has sit at rest careless in the
middis of her fylthy fast laid up riches. She was not yet never set a broche /
drawn out of one vessel into a another / yt is to wit / she came never yet
into captivity / wherefore her verdcur and taste yet abides and endwreth / and
her vigor and savor is not chanched. But lo ye day shall come says ye lord
/ that I shall send her trussers / which shall trusse and pak her up / prepare
and ceason her vessels but her pottis and baggis they shall so shake to gither
yt Moab shall be as miche ashamed of her Chamos as ever was Israel of Bethel even
their own hope. Wherefore think ye thus / we are strong and valeaunt to fight?
Moab shall be destroyed and her cytes shall fleup into ashes. And her chosen
lusty lance kneightis shall be slain says ye king whose name is the Lord of
powrs. Moabs death and fall is at hand / and his miserable calamite comes
fast upon: whom al of his faccion rownde about him shall lamente and bewail /
And as many as know his name / shall say. How happens this so strong a
staff and so gaye a rod to be thus alto broken? And even thou to / daughter
which dwell in Dibon shall come down from thy glory and sit in a dry
thyrste. For the destroyer of Moab shall come unto the / and overthrow thy
strong holds. And thou / oh inhabitres of Aroer shall stand by the way and
behold askinge thez that flee escaped / saing what is chanced? For Moab
shall be confounded and overcome. They shall howl and cry out / and tell it
forth unto Arnon that Moab is destroyed. And like calamite shall come even unto
ye playns / unto Holon Jahazam and Mephat / Dibon / Nebo / and unto the house
of Diblathaim / unto Kiriathaim / Bethganrob and Betheneon / Kirioth / Bassra
and unto all the cytes of the land of Moab both far and nighe. Of the horn
r^de. apo^ where i^ now ye^ur* brachium culare?
Moabs horn shall be alto broken / and his arm shall be shaken in pesis says the
Lord. ye shall make him dronken because 2. tes. Moabe theft deceyte
he magnifyed himself above the Lord: And Moab in his vomyte shall be clapped
out with handis / and be a laughing stock to Shall he not be a laughing stock
unto the (oh Israel) which is fownde among thieves? Thou shalt be cast
forth (oh Moab) for thy deceyte done agenst Israel / ye shall leave your cytes
and dwell in rocks (oh Moabits) and be like doves nestelinge in their hole
mouths. We herd of Moabs pride / he was al to proud / his pride / his
stoughtnes / his arroga^cy / his high lokis were known well enough unto me
says the Lord.
But for all his pride / yet might not his power bring a boute his
enforcementis according unto his arrogaunte furye. Wherefore I shall yeloute
upon Moab / and cry / Moab as loud as I can / so that the dwellers at the
bryk wallis shall here and bewail him: And even with like lamentacion as I
bewail the (Oh Jazer) shall I lament the (oh vyneyarde Sibema / Thy branches
went over the sea: but the branches of Jezer reched but to the sea. But into
thy harvest and grape gatheringe shall this destroyer break in violently. Joye
and gladness shall be taken away from Charmelus and fro the land of Moab as it
is now gone from Charmelus. There shall no more sweet wynes come under the press
/ nor the caller to the grape gatheringe shall no more trede in the wine press:
another shall there be any more callers at al / which before time called and were
herd from Hesebon to Eleale and Jahaz / whose voice was herd also from Zoar
unto Horonaim that wealy bullok of.iii. year old. ye and the waters of Nimrim
shall be desolate to. We sewe no more to Rome, Moab get no more peter petence
etce. Beware your herd Moab.
I shall make a vacacion in Moab (says the Lord) from any more offeringe in
high placis and from sensing their goddis. Wherefore / for Moabs sake my heart
morneth like an heavy crowde: for they shall be brought into very few / and yet
shall these few perisshe to. Every head shall be shaven of / and every / berde
clipped / every hand bownde / and al their loins gyrte with sacken. Upon al
ye house roofis of Moab / and in all her stretis there shall be way singe and
moorninge. For I shall alto break Moab as it were a vile vessel says ye Lord /
Se / how he fereth and howifeth / se how his proud neck is smyten down? how
is he now ashamed? Moab shall be a laughing stock and an ensample to all that ar
about him. For thus says the Lord.
Behold his enymye shall fle to him like an egle and stretche forth his wyngis
over Moab. Then shall his wallis be taken / and his towers of defense occupied.
Than shall the hertis of Moabs valeaunt waryers he like a woman's heart
trauelinge of child. And Moab shall be so scatered / that they be no more any
people / because they extolled themself agenste the ii. Th^ssa. ii.
Lord. Fere shall be unto the (oh Moab) and both pit and snare to / says ye
Lord. For he that shall escape feere or perel / shall fall into the pit: and
he that shall happen to crepe out of the pit / shall be taken in snare. For I
shall bring upon Moab even the hour of their visitacion says the lord. And
they that shall have strength to flee shall run into the fire of Hesebon:
For out of Hesebon shall come a great fire / and flame shall fle out of Sihon
and deuower both nose noddle and crown of the stout proud people of Moab. Woe
be to ye Moab / for thou shall be undone oh people of Chamos. And thy sons and
daughters shall be led away into captivity. Mention is here made of the calling
of the ge^tyls.
But I shall se that Moab shall come a gene here aftir at their time says the
Lord. Hitherto is it prophesied of the plage and vengeance to be taken of
Moab.

The.xlix. Chapter.
UNto the chyldern of Ammon thus says ye lord. Ammon Moabs brother howthe^
were begoten of their dro^ken father by his own daughters red^ Genesis 19
Is Israel chyldlesse / or want he an hayer? But wherefore then does your
Melchon occupye and sit in Gad / and the people of Melchon inhabit ye cite of
Gad? For this cause / lo / the time shall come says ye Lord / that I will
blowup to batail in Babbath the chief cite of the chylderne of Ammon.Lahel
shall be desolate / and her villages burnt up. And ye chyldern of Isarel shall
possess them / which before kept Israel under says the Lord. Let Hesebon
howise / for it shall be utterly subue^ted. Let the towns of ^abbath cry out and
gyrde themselves with sak / let them wayle wanderinge al out their hedges: For
Then abeminable fill thy god.
Moloch shall be carried away captive / both his preistis and princes with him.
Wherefore trustest in thy streams which flow in vain oh fyerce daughter?
thinkinge thy self so suer for thy tresure that noman may come to the? Behold
/ I shall cast a fere upon the / and upon al yt ar about the / says ye lord
god of powrs / And ye shall be scatred every man from other ye non may bring ye
men fleing / together again. The calling of the gentyls is here prophesied
But aftir this I shall restore the captivity of the chyldern of Ammon. Thus
spoke the Lord of powrs unto Idumea. Is there no wisdom left in Theman? ar
these men destitute al counsel? Is their wisdom turned in to naught? Fle /
turn your backis. The bu^den of Idumea
Crepe down into valis there to dwell oh citzens of Dedan. For I shall bring
upon them the destruction of Esau even the day / of their visitacion. If grape
gathers had come to the / they should not have left ye one grape. If thieves
had come upon the in the night / they should have robbed ye at their pleasure.
But I shall make bare Esau and so show his secretis / that they cannot be hid.
His sede shall be destroyed both his brotherne and borderers to / and himself
shalnot be left a live. Thou shall leave thy fatherles chyldern behind the:
but I shall keep them / and thy wydews shall trust in me: i. Petri iiii.
For thus said the Lord. Lo / they that were thought unworthy to drink of the
cup / drank it first of al: and shuldst thou then go quyte as innocent? Thou
shall not go quyte as innocent / but drink as well as other. For I swear by my
now self says the Lord / that Bosra shall be turned into desolacion /
obprobry / contempt and excecracion / and al her cytes shall be a perpetual
wilderness. For I herd verily of the Lord a messengre sent unto the gentylis
sayng. Be ye gatherid together and come forth agenst her / Rise up to bataile:
For lo I shall make the right small among the gentilis / and contemned among
men.
Thy now arrogance and audacite of thy high mind has undone ye: because
thou contendidst to inhabit the holes of the rokis of stone / and to reche up
unto the hill toppis. But albeit thy neste were as high as the egles / yet
shall I pluck ye down out of it says the Lord. Idum^
And Idumea shall be desolate to. All that pass forby her shall wounder and hysse
upon al her miserable calamites. Even as Sodom / Gomor and their cytes about
them were subverted says ye lord: so shall noman inhabit Idumea: nor yet any
mortal man dwell in her. Behold / as the lion comes up from the grene wodes
of Jordane unto the fresshe plentuouse pastures of Ethan: even so shall I
thrustforth her enimye and stere him up to run agenst her. But who is this
young man whom I shall chose to do this deed? And who may match me? Who will
wrestle with me? or which one among all the herdemen may stand in my handis?
Wherefore here the counsel of the Lord / which he has taken and begun upon
Idumea. Here his thoughtis which he has devised upon the citezens of Theman
/ that ye feste of the flock shall tere them in peses / and their fayerest
habitacions shall be left desolate / and they to The earth shall crak at the
noise of their fall: the cry of their voice shall be herd in the red sea. Se /
their enymye mownteth up like an egle / he shall come fleing / his wings spread
a broad over Bosra. And then shall the hertis of the most strong and bold men
of Idumea be like the heart of a woman traueling of child. The burden of Damask
Upon Damask thus prophesied Jeremy. Hemath and Arphat shall be shamefully
co^fownded: for they shall here right cuil tydingis. They shall run here and
there for fere like the sea that cannot rest. Damask shall be fainte herted and
flee. Fere shall over whelme her: Anguysshe and sorrow shall betake and hold her
as a woman trauelinge of child. But shall that merry cite so populose be left
desolate? ye verily. For even their young men shall be smyten down in her
stretis: and al her noble men of arms shall be laid a sleep the same day says
the lord of powrs. And I shall kyndle a fire upon the wallis of Damask which
shall devour ye houses of Benhadad. The bur^en of Cedar.
Unto Cedar and the kingdoms of Hazor which Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon
smote down / thus said the Lord. Arise and go yp unto Cedar and destroy / ye
chyldern of the este. Then shall they take away their tabernacles / their
flockis / their skinnis with all their armor / stuff / and substance. They
shall also take a way their Camelis / and close them in with fere rownde a
boute. Fle / get ye hence at once and crepe into caves there to dwell oh
inhabitours of Hazor says the Lord. For Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon has
decreed and bente his pleasure agenste you. Arise and go up to those rich folk
which dwell so suerly says the Lord: which have nether gatis nor door bars /
but dwell one from a another. Their Camelis shall be stolen / and their herdis of
beastis drouen away. And I shall disperse these polled or shaven crowns into
every wind / and bring them into destruction / ye and that of eueryone of
their own familiaris says the Lord. And Hazor shall be a den for dragons and
a perpetual wyldernes / noman shall there inhabit / nether dwell there any of the
sons of Adam. The burden of Elam.
The sermon of the Lord showed unto Jeremy the Prophet upon Elam in the
beginning of the reign of Zedechie king of Juda.

Thus says the Lord of pwrs. Lo I shall al to break Elam his bow / the chief
weapen of their power: and bring upon Elam four wyndis from the fourte plagis
of heaven: and I shall we now them into al these four wyndis / so that there
shall be no nation unto whom Elam be not come fleing for socour. For I shall so
bring it to pass that Elam shall be a frayd of their emmes / eue^ of those that
seek the lives of them. And I shall bring upon them ye greuouse plage of my
furiouse wrath says ye Lord. And perswe them with sword till I have consumed
thez. I shall set my sete in Elam / and there destroy both king and rulers
says ye lord. The calling of the gentyls. Babylon is Rome. Agenst the king
^^om of ^^ntichri f^te. ^^eel their ^^od / the ^^ope.
But at fast / in process of time / I shall restore the captivity of Elam /
says ye Lord. The sermon which the Lord spoke upon Babylon / and of the
land of the Chaldeis unto Jeremy the Prophet. Tell it forth unto the gentyls
and preche it. Give them a token. Show it them / and hyd it not. But tell them.
Babylon shall be taken. Beel shall be confounded with shame. Merodach shall be taken
/ her graven images shall be shamefully confounded / and their Idolis shall be
taken. For there shall come forth agenst them / a people from the north / which
shall bring their region into a wilderness / that none may dwell in it / another
man nor beast. For they shall fle and go their ways. In those days and time
says the Lord / the chyldern of Israel / both they and the chyldern of Juda
shall come to gither weping and hasting to seek their Lord God. They shall ask
redely the way unto Zion: and their faces turned thither ward / they shall be
joined to the Lord in a covenant never to be broken. My people were of a long
space lost sheep. My herd men led them out of the right way / and made them
to wander in mountayns / Fro mountayns they went to little hyllis / forgettinge
their own bed: Who so fowonde them / devoured them: And even their enymes
said we sinned not / because they are offenders of the Lord / even that lord
which is the beutiful glory and flower of rightwysnes / and the trw hope of
their fathers that preserved them. But ye shall fle from out of the mids of
Babylon: and get ye out from the land of the Caldes: and shall be as rams
that go before ye flock. For behold / I shall stere up and bringeforth from
the north region an host or congregation of a great nation agenste Babylon:
which shall fight agenst her / and aftirwarde take her. Their arowes shall not
rebowne void but steke fast like arows of an expert and strong archer. The
Caldes shall be a proye / and al her spoilers shall be satisfied says the Lord:
Because ye reioysed and gloryed in the tredingdowne of my heretage / taking
your pleasure over them / like ye wealy bullok over her grass / neainge over
them as stallandis: your mother shall be gretely confounded and she that brought
you forth shall be ashamed of you. She shall be rascal of al gentyls / desolate /
laid lay and dry.
The wrath of God shall make her al forlaten unable to be inhabited. Whosoever ever
shall go for bye Babylon / shall suddenly stop and wondre hyssing at her plagis.
Set your array / and ordir your host agenst Babylon closyng her in rownd
about. Al ye can handle a bow / shote at her: spare no arows: For she have
sinned agenst the Lord. Blow up trompets upon her rownd about. She has
yilded hirselfe / her foundacions ar fallen / and her wallis be down. For this
is the vengeance of the Lord. For they shall take vengeance upon her. And as
she have served other / eue^ so shall she be served again. They shall cast out
ye sedis man out of Babylon / and the syithe man in time of mowinge. For fear
of the dente of ye blody sword / every man shall co^uaye himself home again to
his own nation and fle to his cou^trye. Israel is a pore scatered flock.
Lions have scatred them abroad. The first lion ye devoured them / was the
king of ye Assyrio^s. And ye last ye shall al to break their bones is this
Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon. Wherefore thus says ye lord of powrs the God
of Israel. Behold / I shall viset the king of Babylon and his kingdom / even
as I visited the king of Assyrie. And shall bring Israel agene unto her
plesaunte pasturs / and they shall feed upon Carmelus and Basan: And in ye
mount Ephraim and Galaad shall they be well filled. In these days and this time
says ye Lord. If ye wikednes of Israel be sought for / there shall none be
fownde. If the syn of Juda be sought: it shall not be fownde. For I shall be
mercyful unto this litel rea^nant escaped by me. Ascend (oh auenger) unto this
cruel and lordely land and viset her inhabitours: take vengeance and lay
upon their backis (says ye lord) and finisshe al yt I have commanded the. The
rumor of batail and great destruction shall fle through the land / men talking /
How is this great hammer of all the world / ihus now broken alto peses? Rome
has k^^ked us full long time.
How hapeneth it that Babylon among al ye nations is thus brought into
desolatio^? It was I that laid wait for the / and thou wast taken oh Babylon /
thou wast espied unawares / and thus trapped / because thou prouokedst the Lord
to anger. The Lord laid opon his house of ordinance and brought forth the
darts of his indignacion. For this is ye wurk of the Lord God of powers done
of him in the land of Calde. These thingis shall come upon her at last: They
shall break ynto her preuey tresure houses / and leave her as bare as stones
taken and cast upon an heap. And they shall so cut her away / that nothing
be left of her. They shall destroy al her valeaunt soldeyers and put them to
death. Woe be to them: for ye day and howr of their visitacion shall be at hand.
Me thinks / I here even now the noise / both of men fleyng and escapen from
the land of Babylon: which voice or noise shall declare in Zion ye vengeance
of our Lord God eue^ the taking vengeance for his temple: and also the noise
of men cryinge: Call up agenst Babylon the multitude of all the bowemen. Pitche
your tents against her rowndaboute ye none escape. Serve her aftir her own
dealinge / and as she have done to other / so do to her again.
For she presumed to boldly agenst the Lord / even him that sanctifyeth
Israel. Wherefore her mighty soldiers shall be smyten down in the stretis / and
al her noble men of war shall be laid a sleep together in that day says ye
Lord. It it I lo / yt tell it the ( Rome ^s as^nich to ^aye as ^nowde.
oh thou proud) says the Lord God of powers. For ye day shall come / even
the hour of thy visitacion / and the proud shall fall suddenly and be al to
broken / noma^ to lift him up agene. I shall set fire on his cites / which
shall ete up al rownd about hi^. These thingis says the Lord of powers: The
chyldern of Israel and Juda shall suffer both a like great violence and wrong.
Whosoever have taken them / shall hold the^ fast loathe to let them go. But their
strong auenger and mighty redemer / whose name is ye lord of powrs shall so
defend their cause: yt he will ster up a dissension among themselves / and
set the church of Babylon together by the ears. the gretwyse writer o^
their vnwrite^ v^^^rites / where i^ he now become^
The sword upon ye Caldes says the Lord / and upon the inhabitours of
Babylon / upon her rulers / and upon her wise men / the sword upon her soithe
sayers / and they shall be made foles.

The sword upon her bold valeaunt / and they shall be a frayde. The sword upon
her horsemen / chariets / and upon all the come^ people in her / so that they be
al like women. The sword upon her tresurs that they be stolen away. The
sword upon their waters / that they be dried up: For this land is an image
seruer / and delyteth in strange and wounderouse inuencio^s. Wherefore these
cruel insatiable satyris / with marmesaits / apes and mermaydes shall inhabit
her: nether shall she be inhabited for ever / nor dwelled in from age to age.
Like as God subverted Sodom and Gomor with their cytes annexed says the Lord /
even so shall there here noman dwell / nether the sone of Adam shall inhabit her.
Behold / people shall come from the north with great power / and many kings
stered up from the coosts of ye crt^e. They bear bow and buckler / they be
cruel and mercyles / their noise is like a fyerce swelling sea. They come
houeri^g on horsebak / they come forth well armed to fight agenst the / oh
daughter Babylon. The fame of these men once herd / the king of Babylons
handis shall tremble for fere / Anguisshe and sorrow full peine shall hold him as
a woman traueling of child. As the lyo^ lo / comes vpfrome ye grene fennes of
Jordane unto ye fat fayer pasturs of Ethan: eue^ so shall I prick the^
forthwarde and stere the^ up agenst her. But who^ shall I chose chief captain
to do this deed? Who is like unto me? or may strive with me? or which one of
the herdeme^ may resist my face? Wherefore hear the counsel of the Lord
conceived agenst Babylon / hear his ente^te entered agenst the land of
Caldey. That is to wit / eue^ the most weak and lowest of ye flock shall tear
them in pieses. And their most plesaunt placis with their own selves also /
shall be desolate. All the world shall tremble and quake at the fame of the taking
of Babylon / and the rumor of her shall be herd into among the gentyles.

The.li. Chapter.
THus said the Lord. Behold / I shall stere up a pestelent wind agenst Babylon
and her cytesens which ar be^te cruelly agenst me. And than shall I send
wenowers into Babylon / which shall we now her and destroy her field. For they
shall close her in rownd about in the day of her affliccion. Also unto the
archers and harnest men enteringe the walls thus said the Lord: Spare not her
men of arms. Of with the hedis of al her host / that they may lie dead
through the field of the Caldes and smyten through in her streets. For Israel and
Juda although they have filled ye earth with their sins: yet shall they not be
forsaken of their God ye Lord of powrs and maker holy of Israel / and so left
unto the world. Fle from out of ye middis of Babylon: and let every man save
himself. Let noma^ dissemble ye wykednes of Babylon. For the time of the
vengeance of the Lord is now present. For he will acquyte her again. Babylon
was ye golden cup in the land of ye Lord. Which cup has made dronken al
ye world. Of her wine ye people has dronke^: wherefore they are out of their
wittis. But suddenly Babylon is fallen / and alto broken. Bewail her therefore /
and lay ye plaster of resyne unto ^esyne ^aster / (...) the ^^riptu.
heir wou^dis / yt if thus paradue^ture she may be yet healed again. But we
have done our cure (say they) right diligently: and yet is she not healed. We
shall therefore forsake her / and go our ways every man to his own regio^. For
her judgment is turned up unto heaven and removed up unto ye clowdis. The Lord
has laid forth our ryghtwysnes. Come hither therefore and let us put Zio^ in
mind of ye work of our Lord God. Sharpe^ your arows / and fill your quyuers:
For ye Lord shall ster up ye spryte of ye king of Mede against Babylon / eue^
now ready be^te to destroy her. For this shall be ye vengeance of ye Lord / eue^
ye aue^ginge of his own temple. Lift up your signs and shyldes upon ye wallis
of Babylon / warn watches ynowe / set kepers / lay good a wait about. And
yet nethelesse shall the Lord do his purpose decreed upon ye inhabitours of
Babylon. Oh thou Babylon which haste thy situacio^ by so goodly great waters /
having siche riches and so great tresure / thy end is come / thou may
sitdowne and tell up thy wynninge. The Lord of powers has sworn by his own
self to ouerwhelme ye with men as with locustis / which shall aninate and
encourage one a another age^ste ye. Which Lord made ye earth by his might and
did set fast ye world by his wisdom and stretched abroad ye heue^s by his
prudence At his word / ye waters in heaven arise and swell. He calls forth
ye clouds from ye coosts of the earth / and changes thondre into rain / and
leads forth ye wind out of his secret place. Every man is but a fool /
if thou estemest him of his coninge. Every man shall be co^fownded ye casts or
engraueth images. For it is but deceitfully blowme and framed to gither of lies
/ nether is there any brethe in it. Dayne thingis ar they / and works worthy
to be scorned / in ye time of their visitacio^ shall they perisshe. The portion
of Jacob is far unlike these thingis. But he yt made al things whose name is
ye Lord of powrs / he is ye met rod of his heretage. Thou haste scatered our
weapens of war. And I have for thy sake scatered the gentyles / and dispersed
kyngdoms. For thy sake have I scatered horse and man / chariet and him that
rode in it. For thy pleasure I dispersed men and women / old and young /
bacheler and maid. For thy pleasure I dispersed the herdeman and his flock:
the tylman with his catell / Princes and rulers. And now shall I reward
Babylon / al his cytesens / and the Caldes all that calamite which they did to
Zion. ye and that your selves lokyng upon says the Lord. Behold me here upon
the / thou perniciouse pestelent hill says the Lord which vndoist all the
hole world. It is I (I tell the) yt shall stretche forth my hand upon the and

noman may take either corner sto^ne / or top stonne / or foundacio^ sto^ne at

but thou shall be a perpetual deserte says the Lord. Sprede your baners over
the land / blow up tro^pets upon the gentylis. Move ye the nations to take
vengeance on them. Call up these kingdoms agenste the^ / Ararat / Minni and
Aseenez / and tell out Tiphsar to be against her. Bringeforh horses like
swarms of locustis. Appoynte forth agenst her the people of Mede with their
king / princes and al their rulers / ye even al ye hole land under his
empery. The^ shall the land quake and be full heavy when the counsels of the
Lord shall come agenst Babylon to make the land of Babylon desolate that noma^
inhabit it. The valcant men of Babylon shall no more defend her / they shall
krepe into their holds / their strength shall fayl them / they shall be like
women / her habitacions shall be bre^te / her bars shall be broken / one post
shall come runninge agenst a another / and messenger agenst messenger to bring
tydingis to the king of Babylon / that his cite is taken on every side / and
his foordis laid and occupied / her ^ennes set on fire / and the soudyers out
of their wit for fear. For thus says the Lord of powrs ye God of Israel.
Daughter Babylon has been in her time like a ry^e ple^tuouse field of corn:
but shortly oftir was come her repyng time. Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon
has deuourerd and undone me / he has made an empty vessel / and swelowed me
up like a dragon he has filled his belly with my tenderness. He expelled me and
took a way my substance / and at ye I had left and did cast me forth unto
Babylon says ye inhabitres Zion / and expelled my blood unto ye cytesens of
Calde says Jerusalem. Wherefore thus says the Lord. Behold I shall defend
thy cause and aue^ge thy hurt. I shall sowp up her sea and dry up her veins /
And Babylon shall lie like moll hyllis or graves. It shall be an habitacion for
dragons / fear and wondre for that there dwells no body. Then shall they rore
together like lions and lions whelps when they are angrye shaking their locks.
In their hete I shall set drink before them / and they shall be dronken for joy
/ and then shall they sleep a long sleep / from which they shall not be waked
says the Lord. I shall led them forth to veslayne like sheep like wethers
and gotes. How was Sesach taken? How was this noble daughter / flower of al
ye earth thus ^^atched? How came Babylon into this wondering stok among the
gentyls? The sea swelled and arose over Babylon which is over whelmed with her
great waves: her cytes ar desolate / her land over grown ye noman may come
to it / a land wheryn noman dwells / nor yet any son of Adam may pass
through it. And even ye same The Bisshopes and gods of Rome.
Beel in Babylon shall I vyset / and pluck out of his mouth that thing which
he has so swelowedyn / And those folk shall no more swarm so fast to him.
Also the wall of Babylon shall falldowne. Get ye out from the myddis of it
my people / and let every man save him self from the furiouse wrath of the
Lord. Let not your hertis faynte nor fear at every rumor that shall be herd
in the land. For year by year shall ye hear news and diverse tydinges / now
this and then yt strange tyranny and wykednes / soden and often change of rule
and empery. More over / behold / the day shall come that I shall visete the
graven images of Babylon into the utter shame and confusion of all the region:
and her most dear beloved shall lyedede in her. Heaven and earth and what so
ever is in them shall rejoice upon Babylon / when these destroyers shall come
upon her from the north / says the Lord. As Babylon threwdowne the
derebeloued of Israel: even so shall the best beloved of Babylon be thronedowne
thorouout all the realm. ye that fle from the sword / speed you: stand not
still. Remember the Lord in the mean time / even from a far. And let
Jerusalem come into your mind. For we shamed to here of ye obbraydes: very
shame made us to hyde our faces / to se ye aleants come unto the holy house of
ye Lord. Wherefore lo / the time shall come (says the Lord) that I shall viset
the graven images of Babylon that they shall rore like beastis falling down
thorowout al ye region.
If Babylon be extolled unto heaven / ye and defend her power whithe never so
high autorite: yet shall I send her destroyers / says ye Lord. A noise full
of co^psaynte of Babylon / and great destruction / shall be herd from the land
of Calde when the Lord shall destroy her: and shall cast out of her / her
proud rufflyng whereby they have swelled and be blown up like ye waves of the
maigne sea / and made so great crackis with their wordis. For there shall come
unto her (eue^ Babylon I mea^) destroyers: which shall take her baseau^t men
and break their bows. For the Lord is ready to recquyte them / and the Lord
shall reward them abundantly. Also I shall make dro^ken (says the Lord) her
Princes / wysemen / rulers / her mighty men / that they shall sleep continually
/ never to a wake says the king / whose name is the Lord of powers. Thus
says the Lord of powwers. That marvelous thick wall of Babylon shall be
undermined and ouerthrone: and her proud high gates shall be bre^te. And what
so ever those gentyles and people have wroght with so great and weary labor: it
shall perysshe and be brent up. The commandment that Jeremy ye Prophet
commanded Sarie / sone of Nerie / sone of Mahasie: when he should go with
Zedechias king of Juda unto Babylon / the fowerth year of his reign. This
Sarias was chief tresurere.Jeremy wrote al ye calamite that should happen unto
Babylon / in a book: that is to wit al these sermons which ar wryte^ agenste
Babylon And then he bode Sarie. When thou come to Babylon: se thou redest al
these sermons sayng: Lord thou haste decreed upon this place utterly thus to
destroy it / that noman inhabit it: nether man nor beast: but to be desolate
for ever. And when thou have all read ye hole book: thou shall taye a stonne
to it / and cast it into the middis of Euphrates / sainge. Even thus shall
Babylon synke away / and be weryed synking dowe under the burden of
thaffliccions which I shall lay upon her / that she shall neuermore rise again.
Hitherto ar continewed the sermons of Jeremye.

The.lii. Chapter.
ZEdechias was xxi year old / when he began to raygne: ^iii. Regum xxiiii.
and. xxv.
and reigned in Jerusalem xi years: his mothers name was Hamital / daughter of
Jeremy of Lobna. And he did evil even in the eyes of the Lord / and that in all
poyntis as did Joachim / because the Lord was angrye with Jerusalein and Juda
/ until he had cast them out of his sight. Zedechias fill from the king of
Babylon: Decembyr
wherefore in the ix year of his reign / the x day of the x month /
Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon came with all his host unto Jerusalem / and
beseged it / bulwerkis droue^ rownaboute it. And the besege of the cite
enduered unto the xi year of king Zedechias. June.
And ye ix day of the iiii month / the cite was so famesshed / that there was
no food for ye people of that land. Then did all the men of arms brekeforthe
and fled from ye cite be night / comingforth by the way to the gate of the two
wallis / through ye kings orteyarde / the Caldes compassinge the cite rownde
about: and yet went they their ways towerde the playnes. Then persued the
host of the Caldes / and took the king Zedechias in ye field of Jericho /
when al his host was now scatred away from him. And when he was taken: they
led him to Redlatham unto the king of Babylon in ye land of Hemath. Where he
gave judgment upon him. And the king of Babylon slew Zedechias sons before
his eye^: and slew also the rulers of Juda in Reblath^. And the^ he put out
Zedechias eyes / and dow^de his fete together / and brought him to Babylon / and
put him in custodye or presone till he dyed. The x day of the v month / the
xix year of the reign of Nebuchadrezar king of Babylon / came there
Nebuzaradan chief over his host and deputye for the king unto Jerusalem /
and did set fire on the house of the Lord / on the kings palace / on al ye
houses in Jerusalem / and so burnt up all the goodly and great houses. Morouer
all the host of ye Caldes / there being vndyr this chief captain threwdowne
the wall is rownd about Jerusalem. And the raskel of the people there left in
the cite / and siche as fled to the king of Babylon with the multitude of the
artificers left behind / Nebuzaradan tharcheiften over ye host carried a way
with him. But the pore people of the land / Nabuzaradan chief capitayn left
behind still to plant and keep ye bynes and to till the feldis. The brazen
pilers that were in the house of the Lord with their fete / and the great
brason lauer in the house of the Lord / the Caldes broke in pieses / and
carried away all the metal of the^ unto Babylon. The kalderns / tongues /
knyues / sprynkles / spones / and all the brason vessels wherewith they ministered
/ they took all away: water pottes / ships wheryn they put sense / ta^kerdis
/ basins / candelstickis / morters / cups / of which some were al of gold
and some silver / the chief capitayn took away with him. The weight of both the
pilers and of but one of the lauers / and of the xii brason oxen that bore up
the sokets or fete / which king Solomon made for the house of the Lord / the
weight (I say) of the metal of al these Iwels and vessels was above mesure.
For one piler was xviii cubits high / and the rope that went about it was xii
cubitis / and it was four fyngers rownd about / and upon ye top of this
rope / was there sta^derds of brass / of which each was v cubitis high / and
over these toppestonderds was there a kel or net closinge rownd about the
pome granets: and al was of brass. Aftir this manner were both the pillars
facioned and garnesshed with pome granets / of which there were ^^cvi. and al
hanging / as it were in the air / closen under this kell. This Nebuzaradan the
chief capitayn / took Sarias the chief Priest and Zephoniam the preiste next
under him and the iii kepers of the bestrye. And out of ye cite he took a
gelded man / which was master of the kings guard / and vii men that where the
kings servants which were fownde in ye cite. And at last / he took away the
chief scrybe / whose office was to byll the people into the host / with lx
other men / which were of the people of the land and fownde in the cite. These
(I say) this Nebuzaradan the archeiften took away. And carried them to
Reblatha unto the king of Babylon. And the king of Babylon slew them in
Reblatha in the land of Hemath. And thus was Juda translated and led captive
out of their own land.

This is the some of the people led away into captivity of Nebuchadrezar.
IN the vii year of his reign he led away.iii. M. and.xxiii. In ye xviii year
of his reign. Nebuchadrezar ledawaye captyue from Jerusalem.viii. C. men

captivity of Joachin king of Juda the.xxv day of ye xii month: yt Aeuil
Merodach king of Babylon / ye same year yt he reigned / would restore Joachin
king of Juda unto his dignite: and so brought him out of the preson: And
there talked with him very ientely: And ordened him a kingis seat above the
place of other kingis that were with him in Babylon. He changed ye clothes of his
captivity. And he did ete at the kings cost al his life. Also he had his
lyuinge continually given him of the king of Babylon / for every day a
certain allowed him until he dyed.

The lamentacions of Jeremye. vhich he did sit and weepermoorninge upon
Jerulalem: and upon the miserable fall of the Iwes: aftir that Juda was led
away into captivity: and Jerusalem left desolate / lamenting on this manner.

REmember Lord what we suffer: se and behold our ob^robrye. Our heretage it
turned unto aliauntis / and our houses unto strangers. ^e ar karefull
fatherless chyldern / and our mothers sit housbondles. We bye our own water
which we drink: and we bye our wode with money. Persecucio^ hangs over our
neckis. We labor and yet ar like to have no rest. We once yilded our selfs
bownde unto thegypcio^s: but now ar we in like bondage under Assure to: that
yet at ye lest wise we might thus ete our bread. Our fathers were sinners /
which now be gone / and we bear their iniquytes. Exodi xx. deutero. v. Jerem.
xxxi. and Ezech. xviii
The bo^de / and servants ar become our lords and rulers / noma^ to deliver us
out of their ha^dis. We get our lyuinge with great perel of our life for the
drought of the deserte: our hyidis be tanned and parched as it were in an ^oue^
/ so ougely is our stormey famyn. They defiled women in Zion / and virgens in
the cytes of Juda. The rulers ar hanged up with the handis of their enemes.
They did disreuerente the face and person of the elders and fered them nothing
at al. They drew the yongemen about by the members tering out their bowels /
and hanged up laddis upon the treis. The elderly men sat no more in judgment
at the gates / and their young men played no more upon their musyke instrume^tis.
Our hertis joy failed. Our merry quere is turned into moorni^ge. The crown of
our headis fallen of. Ah less for sorrow yt ever we so sinned. For our sins
our hertis moorne / and our eyes be wasted with bitter teris for ye mount Zion.
Which is now so desolate / that foxes ru^ne in it. But thou (oh Lord) which
abidest for ever / and thy seat roial thorout al ages: wherefore forgettest thou
us for ever? Why forsakest thou us so long? Convert us unto the (oh Lord)
and so shall we be converted. Renew and restore us our days as they have been
in time paste. For thou have now repelled us long enough / and ben angrye
with us above mesure.

The end of the Prophet Jeremy: translated by George Joye. An M.D.xxxiiii.
Mense Maii.

To supplee the lefe / take here (Cryste^ reder) that goodly and godly song of
Moses. Where with thou ought now gloriously to magnify and praise God for the
destruction and throing down of our cruel Pharao the Bishop of Rome: no
another wise then did Moses and his church loaue him for drownyng of Pharao:
which Pharao fygured our blodye Bisshops of Rome.

The song of Moses and his Church / songen aftir Pharasus death drowned with
his host in the red sea.
I Shall sing with praise unto the Lord: Exode xv.
For it is he verily / that is gloriously to be magnifyed. Horse and man /
has he casten down into the sea.

The Lord it is / unto whom I ^leue: It is the Lord / whom I praise / he is
become my health and salvation.

It is he that is my God. Him will I glorifye. He is the God of my fathers /
and even him will I exalte.

The Lord is a mighty man of war: Jehouah is his name: Pharaous chariettis
and host has he casten down into the sea.

His ioylye chosen capytayns ar drowned in the red sea / the deep waters have
overwhelmed them / they sanke down unto the botome like stones.

Thy rightha^de oh Lord is great and gloriouse in strength: Thy righthande
Lord has thrusted down the enemy.

To thy great glory haste thou destroyed thine adversaries: thou sentst forth
thy wrath / and it consumed them like stobble.

With the brethe of thine anger ye waters ra^ne together on heapis: so that ye
bare botome was seen / the flowing flowd stodevp as fast as a rock. And the
boto^les water was congeled in the myddis of the sea.

The enemy had thought thus / I shall follow and take them / I shall deuyde out
the spoil / and satisfye my pleasure upon them / I shall draw out my sword and
my hand shall slaye them.

But thou didist but blow with thy brethe / and the sea ran over them: They
sanke down lyk led under ye vehement waters.

Who emonge the goddis is like unto ye oh Lord? Who may be compared unto the
in power and might? who is like unto the in magnificence and holiness? who is
like the in reverent fere / to be praised doing so wondreful miracles?

Thou stretchedst forth thy righthande / and the sea swelowed them in.

But in thy mercy have thou led forth thy people whom thou delyueredst: and
with thy mighty power have thou brought them unto thy holy habitacion.

Which thing when the gentyles herd of / they were sore trowbled / soden
sorrowful panges fill upon the Philistens.

Then the Princes of Edom were confownded with fear / trembling came upon the
mighty Moabitis / and all the hertes of thin habitours of Canaan melted for fear
and sanke a way like water.

Let anxt and fear fall upon them through the great might of thine arm / that
them be as still as stones while thy people pass through / oh Lord: while this
people pass through / whom thou haste gotten into thy possession.

Bring them in / plant and fill them upon the mount of thine heretage / ye
very habitacio^ (Lord) which thou have made the to dwell in / even thy nowne
secret sanctuary oh Lord which thy ha^dis have prepared.

The Lord be king evermore to reign world with out end. Amen.

Finis.
