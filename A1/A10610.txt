The remors of conscience.

Here begins certain demonstracyons by our lord to all sinful persons
with the Remors of man's conscience to the regard of the bounte of our lord.





Deus. Our gracyous god most in magnyfyce^ce
His mercyful eyes casts from heaven on hi
Seeing his creatures in deedly vyolence
Him self complayneth by pity full rutfully
Saying o man deuoyde of intellygence
Open thine eeres unto my call and cry
And tell me if I have done to the offense
That thou forsakest my wyllyngly
Man such a love to the I did take
This world in seven days wha^ I it wrought
Thou was the last thing that I did make
Because I would thou wanted naught
What thing the might help did not lake
That at thy need if it were sought
Foul fysshe all thing for thy sake
For thy comfort all was forth brought
Moreover I gave the that dygnyte
All beestes to bow the until
I made the also like unto me
And gave the conning and freewyll
Me to serve that thou should se
To chose the good and leave the ill
I ask nothing again of the
But love thy sovereign as it is skyll
But unto this take thou none entente
Thou tournest fro me full unkindly
On loves unlawful thy love is lent
Thy heart beholds not heaven so hye
For all the goods I have the sent
The lysteth not ones to say gramercye
In time to come or thou repent
Man make amends or that thou dye

Homo. A christian soul conceived in sin
Received in conscience thus complanynge
He fell down flat with delefull dynne
And said lord mercy sovereign king
A most unkind Wretch of man kynne
I know I am thy traitor untrue in my living
This wicked life that I live in
I may it naught hyde from thy knowing
I want words and also wit
Of thy kyndnesse to speak a cause
That I have thou gave me it
Of thy goodness withouten cause
Though I have grieved the and do yet
Thy benefaytes thou naught withdrawse
I have deserved to have hell pytte
So have I lived against thy lawse
But lord thou know man's feblenesse
How frail it is and has been aye
For though the soul have thy likeness
Man is but fulsome earth and claye
In sin conceived and wretchedness
And to the soul rebel always
First a man grows as does gresse
And he wastes after as flowers or hay
Sith man is than so frail a thing
And thy power so great in kind
This world is but a twynkelynge
Thou may destroy the might of the find
With thy right lord mercy mynge
And to my sore salve thou fend
Sore me repents of my myslyuynge
Mercy lord I will amend

Deus. Man I gave the bodyly hele
That thou should it spend in my service
Fayrenes also and fetures feel
Man what do thou with all these
Thou with delytes of the devil do dele
Which is to me a great despise
Thou lyuest a lecherous life vnlele
Fro year to year thou list not rise
Thou studyest after nyce array
And make great cost on thy clothing
To make the semely as who should say
Thou coudest amend my making
Thou purposed the day by day
To set my people in synnynge
Thy wretched will thou folowest always
What end sin has you thynkest nothing
In Noes time because of sin
And for lecherye in especyall
What vengeance came than to man's kynne
Save.viij. persons drowned were all
On Sodom / and Gomor / and the men wtin
How I made fire and brymstone fall
Fro heaven on them that bode therein
for sin were destroyed both great and small
Man wenest thou my might be less
Than it was than or that else I
Thou have no as much wyckdnesse
As when I smote the most pyteously
But if thou will thy fautes redress
Thought I now spare for my mercy
Man think on my ryghtwysnesse
And make amends or that thou dye

Homo. I wot well lord right full thou art
And that sin must be punysshed need
But one thing holds in hope my heart
Thy mercy passes my mysdede
I know well that I may not sterte
I have so done me ought to dread
With beauty and with bodily quarte
To serve the I have taken no head
I have my spend my young age
In sin and wantonness also
To serve god slow / and loved to rage
A gloton a lechour I was both two
I am worth none other wage
But for to dwell in endless woo
Alas why have I ben outrage
And served the fend that is my foo
But lord in holy write read we
That thou forsakest no wretched wight
That leueth his sin and tourneth to the
And to turn to the have I hight
Full proud and rebel have I been
But now I take me to thy might
From hens forward to be clean
Against mine own flesh to fight
My flesh to feeble I will fast
My bones to travail and to tene
And through thy grace I am not aghast
What sore and sickness on me seen
To suffer while my life may last
For utterly I will attend
To punysshe that I have trespast
Mercy Jesus I will amend

Deus. Man I have sent the silver and gold
And all thy wealth within thy wone
To sustain the and thy household
And also other many one
Thou might have helped young and old
That been deseased and woo begone
My servants suffered both hungre and cold
Relefe of the yet have they none
If thou give for my love a farthynge
Thou do it with an heavy heart
In alms thou gyuest no thing
For dread thou fall in pouerte
In flesshely lust and worldly liking
What ever thou wastest merry thou art
Of such I will have a reckoning
At domes day thou shalt not astarte
Than shalt thou give a countes full streyte
How thou come by thy good each dele
Whether with troth or with deceyte
And how thou spend it ill or well
None other grace thou after wait
As thou have wrought so shalt thou feel
What shall than profit thy good in plate
Or pounds that thou of the people pele
A clean conscience shall that day
More profit the and more set by
Than all the goods or the monaye
Than ever was under heaven or sky
It will never help to plete nor pray
For as ryghtwyse than deem will I
And therefore man whiles thou may
Make amends or that thou dye

Homo. I wot well lord fro year to year
Full greatly grieved I the have
That I would nor they mercy were
My mothers womb had be my grave
For what profyteth my living here
But afterward I should be save
But Ihesu as thou bought me dear
Leave not my soul in hell cave
My waste expense I will withdraw
For waste well called may it be
For it was spended my boost to law
My name to bear on land and se
Well I wot me there not trow
Though many a man of my country
If they me met they did me not know
Nor never yet herd speak of me
Falsely I have wrought as wretch unwise
I might have gotten me much mede
Had I it spente in gods service
But brought they grace lord I am in dread
As men that lies and may not rise
For have I am mine all our need
With the remenaunt lord at thy deuyse
The poor and naked with cloth and fere
Seek men that lain in gods bands
That have no silver for to spend
And prisoners bound both fete and hands
Often to vysyte and them attend
When I se them that in need stands
Such as I have I shall them send
Lord let these works less my band
And mercy Ihesu I will amend

Deus. Man if thou amends will make
Give thine alms of thyn own goods
And se thou work no man to wrake
To venge any other men's modes
If thou untruly from any take
And therewith find forty their fodes
Such sacryfyce I forsake
They be to me as souer as wormewode
The pore people thou do oppress
With sleyghtes and wyles many one
Thou make chyrches and do lynge mess
Thou mendest ways where men over gone
And some men curse and some men bless
Which shall I hereof these two
If thou will have grace as I guess
Let all falsenes be fled the fro
The mothes that thy clothes ete
And thou let pore men go bare
Thy drink soureth and mouleth thy mere
Wherewith the poor man might well fare
The rust that thy silver does frete
Thy goods that evil gotten are
They cry on the vengeance great
The for to spyll but yet I spare
With hold here against the right
From thy servants upon the cry
Man oftentimes thou have me hight
Thou would amend and leave folly
Thou spekest full fair both day and night
Thou brekest my commandments co^tynually
Yet is me loathe with the to fight
But make amends or that thou dye

Homo. Sweet lord I may not against say
I have not holden that I the hight
I grieve the gretely every day
I do not as I had the plyght
I woide do well but welawaye
with enemies I am ever beset
when my soul feign would the pay
My flesh is first that will me let
And ever the farther that I it feed
Ever the fressher it is my foo
Yet bear it about I must need
Full feeble it is it will me sloo
The world / the fend / the flesh / they bid
Some with well and some with woo
what may I do with a wicked wede
To fight against three enemies so
when I enforce me other whiles
And think I will live a true live
And forsake all batayles and gyles
The world byddeth me battle belyue
And but I will use wrethes and wyles
The comen voice is I shall not thryue
Some me scorneth and at me smyles
And count me but a kind caytyue
But now I think withstondynge this
To forfake falnesse withouten end
And restore that I took amys
And pay my dettes fair and hende
And to reward each man his
As reason is than will I spend
And give mine alms there need is
Mercy Jesus I will amend

Deus. Man I have sent the kyndly sight
And understanding skyll and wit
To rule thy self by reason right
As reherseth holy write
That clearly shows the godly light
How thou should deedly sin forsake
And on that manner thou please me might
What ayleth the thus fro me to shake
World richesse royal repair
In wealth and things of Iolyte
Fysshes / beestes / and birds of the air
These thinks me semely for to se
That thing y^ peressheth and does appayre
Unto the sight thus pleasynge be
Well may thou wit I am full fair
Of whom each thing has this beauty
But man as thou wytlesse were
Thou lokest aye downwarde as a be
It behooves the of me to here
Foul speaking is to the a feast
I comfort the I make the chere
And thou inwardly love me leest
I call the unto me year by year
Thou will not come at my request
As fro thy foo thou fro me feles
I follow the fast and on the cry
Thou wrappest the with all vanytes
And think my speech to the but folly
And a thing that naught is thou wyltelese
My Joy that lasts endless
Man yet vice leave and virtue chese
And make amends or that thou dye

Homo. Sweet Jesus none answer I can
But often cry mercy with heart stable
Alas for woo why is a man
Worse than a be unreasonable
All beestes sythen the world began
In kyndly werkynge ben durable
Save only I of will wan
That do full many deeds dampnable
I was made to know my maker
And to love him over all thing
And I a sleper and never waker
To take kind knowing of my king
To tryfles have I ben a great head taker
A song of sorrow may I sing
For had I ben of sin a forsaker
Of christ should I have been some knowing
My ghoostly eyes ben full of duste
Cursed couetyse has blinded me
They ben blodeshotten with fleshly lust
That heavenly king may I not se
But lord though I have been unjust
Through help of thy benygnyte
I hope to rube away the ruste
With repentance and grace of the
And where that I have before this
My will in worldly thing have spend
From heus forward my purpose is
Thy law to learn to my lives end
Thy.x. commandments truly Iwys
Them to keep I will me mende bend
And there as I have done amys
Mercy Ihesu I will amend

Deus. Man my mercy if it be in thy mind
I have the it showed in many wise
Sythen the time thou first synde
Against my commandment in paradyse
In hell prison when thou were pynde
For doing of the deuylles deuyse
Out of thy tene to betwynde
Mercy and love thyn help were these
Mercy was thyn aduocat chief
That I for the took flesh and blood
Love made the to be so lefe
That I for the was rent on rode
I suffered death to change thy grefe
And unto hell than down I yode
And brought the to bliss fro reprefe
Man I have been thy friend full good
I become poor the rich to make
To make the white I was made reed
My sorrow my sekenes made thyn to slake
My hungre did bake thy blysfull breed
I bond my self my bonds I brake
To get the life I suffered death
What should I do more for thy sake
To hele thy foot was hurt my head
Now if thou think I might more do
For thy sake I am ready
To dye again if need were thereto
Such love to the man had I
I hight the myrthes and Joys moo
But thou art most thyn own enmye
For ought I bydde thou will do so
Man make amends or thou dye

Homo. Lord when I on thy pouerte aduerte
And how wylfull thou were and feign
To suffer for my wounds smerte
To slay my sins thou were slain
Harder than iron is my heart
That has no pity of thy pain
Ever the kynder to me thou art
The more vnkynder I am again
Why would thou lord be slain for me
That am thyn enemy most vnhende
Sith no man has more charity
Than death to suffer for his friend
By what skyll should thou so slain be
Sith I made me thrall to the fend
I trespasser lord why ne smote thou
Now blessed be thou withouten end
I se well lord that thou love us
For our profit and not for thine
For what were thou the worse Jesus
Though all we were in endless pyne
Alas why be we so bycyous
And so unkindly from him declyne
That is our god so gracyous
And so loathe man soul to pyne
But sweet lord as thou have begone
So let thy mercy forth extend
Put thy cross and thy passion
Between my works worthy to be brende
And thy dome that I may not shonne
That hounds of hell come me not hende
Who but the father should help the sone
Mercy Jesus I will amend

Deus. Man if thou will my mercy get
Through my passion of most virtue
Why ceasest thou not me for to beat
Each day on the cross do me new
With deedly sin on morrow at mete
As tourmentours to me untrue
And namely with thy oaths great
To swear thou will nothing eschew
No lymme of me / nor thou derest
Why say thou evil against good
By my soul often time thou swerest
By my body and by my blood
With thy tongue thou me all to terest
When thou art wroth and almoost wode
Man with thyn unkindness thou me derest
More than they rent me on the rode
Thou have more pity of thy too
If it be hurt and a little blede
And all that ever I did do
I suffered it for thy mysdede
When thou art taught that thou should do
Of swerynge but when it were need
Thou scornest them that says so
Thou take to my bidding no head
Loud lesynges on me thou make
Sometime to win an half penny
When to witness thou me take
And yet thou forswerest the wylfully
Byenge and selling thou not forsakest
But vain and false to swear me by
When thou do thus thy bale thou take
Man make amends or that thou dye

Homo. Sweet Jesus how should I again say
But that I am a caytyfe and more curste
That does on the curse every day
with great oaths and works worste
And much more the greueth than they
On caluary that flewe first
For had they known the for god very
To do the to death they had not durst
But I knew the after my believe
That thou art god omnypotent
And I seace not the to grieve
well worthy am I to be shente
How may thou lord suffer to meue
Of the traitors that the tourment
Marvel it is I do not myscheue
Or am not killed / drownet / or brent
The earth swalowed quycke
Satan and abyron for their sin
And as I wene they were never so wycke
As most certyfefull mankynne
In deedly sin men dye now thycke
Disease full great now does begin
yet in my sin I stand and stycke
Evil custom is full hard to blynne
I would be wanton and do evil
But I would none me reprehende
But let me live after my will
This was lefull sometime I wend
But now I se that it is skyll
Such light lord thou haste me send
But I leave sin it will me spyll
Mercy lord I will amend

Deus. Man of thy self it shall be long
If so be that thy soul be spylte
Forgive them that done the wrong
And I shall forgive the thy gylte
And if thou be of heart so strong
That in nowyse forgive thou will
But venge thy self with heart and tongue
As a traitor thou shalt be spylte
Thou getest no man the to save
That no mercy on other hace
How may thou of mercy crave
And thou will grant no man thy grace
Merciful man shall mercy have
Fell folk I slay fro my face
What example that I the gave
When death I suffered no tent I race
I prayed for them that me dyseased
Though I might a dampened them for aye
And if thou be a little dyspleased
Thou cursed and varyest both night and day
For no techynge will thou be pleased
To venge the is thy will always
Full foul should thou foos be failed
If thou myghtest as I on the may
Without cause often thou art wroth
Unto thy friends vnkyndfully
When they theteche and counseyle both
To leave thy wrath and thyn envy
With words great and spytefull oath
Thou defendest thy soul foulye
But the to lose I am full loathe
Man make amends or that thou vye

Homo. Sweet Jesus think thou made us all
And how kind and propre it is to the
On sinful men that to the call
To have mercy and pity
Though I have been bitter as gall
For thy great pity have mercy on me
For thy love that I never fall
But kyndly in me charity
For I could the people ken
And speak with aungelles tongues clear
And thought I delte among poor men
My worldly goods all in fere
And though I did my body brenne
For love of the that bought me dear
yet all this profyteth me not then
In charity but if I were
And I wot lord it is more pleasynge
To the Jesus my sovereign dear
To love the lord over all thing
And be in charity and accord here
With all my neybours by ryghtwyse delynge
Than for to fast through out the year
And all the masses the priests sing
But if I love I am no comfort nere
Alas why have I wrothfull ben
That love of my heart was not hende
I hated that never did me tene
I loved not him that me good lend
I cast me no more to be kene
To love mine enemies I will attend
Shall I him never curse I wene
Mercy Jesus I will amend

Deus. Man if thou will of bates blynne
And charity keep in every chance
My mercy sone thou may win
So that thou do thy true penance
Look thyn heart be contryre within
And be sorry for thy mysgouernaunce
What profyteth to shryue the of thy sin
But thou in heart have repentance
Thou show and penance do none
For thy sin but thyn heart be sore
For worldly loss thou make moan
Thou synnest and sorowest not therefore
And if thou were woo begone
What bitter medycyne given the wore
With Joy thou would take it anon
To bodily health the to restore
Thy soul with deedly sin is slain
And without sorrow thy sin thou tells
To do such penance thou art not feign
As thy thryfte father the counselles
Ne thou will never restore again
Falls gotten goods that thou with melles
Man thou must always suffer pain
Here for thy sins or somwhere else
It is impossyble and may not be
To pass fro Joy to Joy on hye
Take the cross and follow me
If thou will to bliss up stye
Sickness and all aduersyte
what and it come suffer it pacyently
Hate always sin and fro it fle
And make amends or thou dye

Homo. Lord give me grace amends to make
For of myself me fails powere
All deedly sin now I forsake
And would do deeds that in defull were
In this world send me woe and wrake
For all my sins done in fere
Who has no sorrow here may quake
Them that thou love thou chastyse here
For my sake.xxx. year and moo
Great travail here in earth thou had
Thy mother and thy apostles also
In great disease their life they ladde
In aduersyte and much woo
Every good man should be glad
Sith that derlynge that with the did dwell
Had such aduersyte in her life
That heart may think or tongue can tell
The pain the anguysshe and the strife
That dampened have in hell
Than endless woo and sorrow be ryfe
I will forsake my sins fell
And to a descrete priest the shryue
In true penance is mine intent
From hens forward my time to spend
And keep well thy commandment
For else in hell fire I shall be brende
Royal repair rich robes and rent
What may they help me at my end
But I the serve I shall be ^^ent
Mercy Jesus I will amend

Deus. Man do penance while thou may
Leest suddenly I take vengeance
Bydde I the not day by day
For cause I would thou did penance
Man I am more ready always
To forgive thy misgouernaunce
When you of all thy friends haste made assaye
Thou shalt find none like to me
Thou will amend often times thou said
Again amends no man may be
Do true penance and I am paid
From endless pain to make the fre
For thy love my life I laid
What friend should have done so for the
With sorrowful heart thy sin thou shryue
And make amends to thyn enemy
If thou thus leave thy wicked live
I will be thereof glad truly
Think oftentimes of lothes wine
And turn not to thy sin again
Let no dyspayre down the drive
Think on Peter and Magdalayne
Man wype away thy wickedness
And keep my bidding by and by
And thou shalt have in my palesse
Worship withouten vylany
No pouerte but all rychenesse
Health / strenth / and wisdom truly
Thou shalt be full of all swetnesse
And than to live dnd neuermore dye

Homo. Grant mercy Jesus croppe and rote
Of al frenshyp for in none fayles
Against the I will not mote
But as often as me evil ails
I will fall down flat to thy foot
To help me in ghoostly batayles
Now wot I where I shall me hyde
When I am stered to any sin
In the great wound of thy right side
And be hertely hid therein
As in a toure there may I abide
For ought ye find can me ymagyn
For all this world that is so wide
Therein is sovereign medecyn
There may no wanhope make me care
That have of they aungelles so good
To keep me that I not mysfare
And thy mother mywest of mode
Lord shende us thy wounds then
And than of mercy we may not mysse
And than to help christian men
Now Jesus lord thou us wyshe
That we with the may bide to bliss
In Joy and bliss withouten end
That to thy people ordained is
That leave sin and them amend

AMEN.
