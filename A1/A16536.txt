Quod Lex operum minando imperat, Lex Fidei credendo impetrat.

TO THE READER,
I Have studied to make all the answers short in these three Catechismes, for
the help of thy memory: First to know, and then to do, is perfect
Christianity.

TO The most Religious, and Noble Lady, the Countess of Argyle, etc.
MADAME,
THis world is full of people, whose religion is compounded like the TURKISH,
in part CHRISTIAN, in part JEW, in part WORLDLING, in part ATHEIST, in part as
A grippa, almost Christians: Only these are happy, who according to the
Apostle his wish, Act. 26 29.
are altogether Christians.

A time of trial will come, which shall discern almost from altogether:
Happy shall these professors be, to whom the Lord shall say, Luke 22 28.
Ye are these which have continued with me in my temptations; and I appoint
unto you a kingdom, verse. 29.
as my Father has appointed unto me, verse. 30.
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; of all honors this
shall be found the greatest.

GOD, Madame, has highly honored your La. both with grace and place: As for
grace, ye may without flattery, with S. John's Lady, be called the ELECT LADY:
2 John 1
As for place, Ye both by birth and marriage are high, but highest in this,
that your La. art humble.

I will not here enter into a large discourse, concerning the Noble and Potent
Earl your La. Husband, whose virtues have most Oriently shined in our general
Assembly, which his Lordship did much honor with his presence, and help with
his counsel.

That which the Apostle did require for the house of Onesiphorus, that I most
heartily wish to his Lordship, to your La. and to all your noble Line and
Family, 2 Timothy 1.18.
that the Lord grant that ye may find mercy of the Lord in that day.

Let it please your La. graciously to accept of this little labor, and to
honor it with your favor, it shall be but an EARNEST of more, if I live, and
if God permit.

From Glasgow the 14. of Ianuar, 1639. Your Ladyships in all humble duty and
observance M. ZACHARY BOYD

Q. What say thou of his Essence?

A. It is spiritual, simple, incomprensible, unchangeable.

A. Only one God.

Q. How many persons are they in the Godhead?

A. Three, the Father, Son, and holy Ghost.

THE SECOND SUNDAY.
Q.
ARE not these three persons divided one from another, so that it may be said,
here is the Father, and there is the Son?

A. No, not.

Q. How then?

A. The persons of the Trinity are diverse one from another, but not separate.

Q. How can that be?

A. The Father in an unspeakable manner is in the Son, and the Son in the
Father, and the holy Spirit in them both.

Q. How are the persons distinguished one from another?

A. By their inward properties, and order of their outward working.

Q. How are they distinguished by their inward properties?

holy Ghost?

A. Because our creation proceeds from the father first in order.

Q. Wherefore is the Son called our Redeemer?

The seventh Sunday.
Q. WHat is sin?

A. The transgression of Gods Law.

Q. How many sorts of sin be there?

A. Two: original sin, and actual sin.

Q. What call thou original sin?

A. That corruption wherein all mankind is conceived; and born, since the fall
of Adam.

Q. What has this sin done to man?

A. It has defiled all the faculties of his soul.

Q. What has it done to his mind and understanding?

A. It has so blindfolded it, that the wisdom of God seems folly to man.

Q. What has it done to his will?

A. It has made it perverse and froward against the will of God.

Q. What has it done to his affections?

the whole man?

A. It is even so.

The eight Sunday.

A. Every omission of our duty, and commission of that which is against the
law of God.

adultery in the heart.

Q. How differs original sin from actual sin?

A. As the tree from the fruit, or as the root from the branches.

Q. Thy meaning, is that original sin, is the root from whence spring all
our actual sins?

A. I understand so.

The ninth Sunday.
Q. ARE all men sinners?

A. Yea, verily.

Q. Is it not said, that these that are borne of God sin not?

A. Sin reigns not in their mortal bodies.

Q. When is sin said to reign in a man?

A. When he so takes delight in his sins, that he cares not in any wife for
the offending of God.

Q. Do the godly sin with such a delight?

A. No, not; they do the evil they would not.

Q. How is that done?

A. The flesh coveteth against the Spirit.

Q. What understandest thou by the coveting flesh?

A. That remainder of natural corruption, which as yet is unmortified in the
godly.

Q. Wherefore call thou these rests of corruption in the faithful, after
the name of flesh?

A. Because through the flesh, or through carnal generation, the filthiness
of sin is conveyed unto the whole man.

Q. What other reason may be given.?

A. Because the flesh or body is the instrument to execute the lusts of our
natural concupiscence.

Q. What understandest thou by the Spirit against whom our corruptions covet?

A. By the Spirit I understand the holy Spirit, and his working, whereby our
natural corruptions are subdued.

A. He was both GOD and man, in one person.

Q What needed the Savior of man, to be man?

A. That he might die for our sins.

Q. What other reason be there?

A. Seeing it was man that had sinned, the justice of GOD required that a man
should suffer for the sin of man.

Q. Wherefore needed our Savior to be GOD*

A. That he might bear that infinite wrath of GOD, and at last overcome death.

Q. What other reason have thou?

A. That his death might be of ane infinite merit.

Q. Thou think then that none but he who was also GOD, could overcome
death, and by his death make a full satisfaction to GODS justice?

A. It is an assured knowledge of Gods mercy in Christ, particularly
apprehended by these whom God has elected to salvation.

Q. Is not Satan said to believe?

A. He has knowledge, but not that assurance which is the life of faith.

Q. Thou understandest that Satan knows that God is infinite in mercy, but
that he has no assurance of any mercy for himself?

the Sacraments, and by a good life.

appear just in Gods presence.

Q. Is not man justified by his good works?

A. Before men he may be, but not before God.

Q. Wherefore not before God?

A. Because God has denounced a curse against him that fulfilleth not
perfectly the whole law.

Q. Can not a man perfectly fulfill the law of God?

A. No, not.

Q. How provest thou that?

A. Because there is no man but he sins, and sin is the transgression of the
law.

Q. Thou beleevest that it is Christ only, who by his works and sufferings
has made full satisfaction for all the faithful?

A. I believe so.

The fourteenth Sunday.
Q. MAY not a man be saved without Faith?

A. There is no salvation without faith.

the belly, but as consecrate, for to be a seal of the spiritual food of the
soul.

negligence?

A. It is most certain.

Q. How know thou that?

A. The Apostle says, when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord, that
we should not be condemned with the World, 1 Cor. 11.32.

Q. I see that there is great difference, between the unworthie communicating
of the godly, and of the wicked?

A. Yea verily; for God chasteneth the godly for their negligence, but he
condemns the wicked for their contempt.

Q. But will not this make many of the godly the more careless in their
preparation, seeing that though they communicate unworthily they shall not be
condemned?

A. The chastisement of their negligence is to great that it should make the
best of us to tremble, diverse calamities as sickness, death, loss of goods,
terrors of conscience are appointed for such.

Qu* How then eat we his body?

A. In a spiritual manner.

Q. How is that done?

A. While we believe; that his body was broken for us, we are said to eat his
body.

Q. Wherefore is our believing called a eating, and a drinking.

A. Because as our bodies live by eating and drinking, so our souls live by
believing that Christ's body was broken, and his blood powered out for our sins.

TO THE NOBLE LADY, D. Anne Campbell; Daughter to the Noble and Potent Earl,
the Earl of Argyle, etc.
MADAME,
I Here humbly dedicate unto your Ladyship, now of tender years these two
compends of the Catechism.

Saint John, the Cusin, and beloved Disciple of Jesus Christ, who for his high
doctrine was compared to an Eagle that mounteth very high, disdained not to
write unto Children. In one chapter of a short Epistle he has* I write unto
you little children; 1 John 2 12* verse. 13
and again in the same words, I write unto you little children; of that his
writing he gives two reasons; the one is in these words, because your sins
are forgiven you for his Names sake; the other reason is in these words,
because ye have known the Father: For this end, Madame, have I written unto
you these two compends, that ye may know the Father; whom I most humbly
entreat to increase his graces begun in your Ladyship in a good measure*

From Glasgow the 19. of Ianuar, 1639. Your Ladyships most humble Servant, M.

A prayer at the hour of Death.
Because death is very uncertain; and Pastors can not be ever pre sent at the
last hour of dying men, I have set down this Prayer for the com fort of such,

MOST gracious GOD, most dear and loving Father, let the words of our mouth,
and the meditations of our heart, Psalm. 19.14
be acceptable in thy sight, for thou art our Lord, our strength and our
Redeemer: We most unworthie to speak for our selves, are hold here to call
upon thee, and most humbly to entreat thee, to be gracious and merciful to
this thy faithful servant, now going from the earth to his long home in the
heavens. Eccles. 12.5


Thou Lord Jesus, who can not lie, have said unto us: John 14.13.
That whatsoever we shall ask the Father in thy name, thou will give it unto
us; O Father of mercies, we seek from thee, in the name of thy Son Jesus, that
all the sins of this thy now dying servant may be forgotten, and fully and
freely forgiven him: though his sins have indeed been red like Scarlet and
Crimson, Isa. 1.8
let it please thee so to wash him with the virtue of the blood of Jesus, that
his soul once polluted and defiled with sin, may be made white like the
woole* yea, whiter then the snow.

Thou Lord understandest the groans of thine own Spirit; thou have begun a
good work in him; now as thou do with the year, Psalm. 65.11.
crown it with thy goodness: seal up in his heart that peace which thou have
purchased with the blood of Christ Jesus, the Prince of peace; Assure him now
of the rest of these joys, whereof he in his life has had by thy grace a
merciful foretaste, in the very throes of death, and greatest throngs of
temptations; uphold him with the hope of glory: Let his faith get a full
victory over all the enemies of his salvation: Let the virtue of Christ's Cross
crucify the world unto him, and him unto the world; let the death of Jesus be
the death of his sins, and the life of his soul. Say unto his soul, Be of
good comfort, all thy sins are forgiven thee.

Seeing while he is here at home in the body, he is absent from the Lord, make
thou him confident and willing rather to be absent from the body, that he may
be present with thee his Lord in the heavens, among the Angels and and spirits
of just men, who are always in thy presence, beholding thy face, wherein is
fullness of joy.

Now Lord, while his flesh and his heart fail him, be thou the strength of his
heart, and his portion for ever; for whom has he in heaven but thee, and there
is none on earth whom he desires besides thee: make haste Lord, come Lord,
Jesus come. Open now the doors of thy mercy, and suffer this wearied traveller
to enter into thine everlasting rest.

O Spirit of comforts, the Comforter of troubled souls, seal up in his heart
the pardon of all sins, with the blood of Jesus, and now crown all thy gifts
and graces in him with thy glory, Lord Jesus receive his spirit, Father into
thine hands we commend his soul; To the Father, Son and holy Ghost, be
everlasting glory, praise, power and dominion, for ever, and ever, Amen.

FINIS.
