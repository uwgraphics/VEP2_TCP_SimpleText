The Joyful Peace, concluded between the King of Denmark and the King of
Sweden, by the means of our most worthy Sovereign, James, by the grace of
God, King of great Britain France and Ireland, etc.
To the tune of who list to lead a Soldiers life.

THe Lord of Hosts has blessed no Land
As he has blessed ours:
Whom neither famine, sword nor fire
Nor mys^rie deuoures.
But in his mercy always still
He gives us blessings store^
And does the hungry ever ^ll,
And feed both rich and poor.
For we that know not woes of war
Forget the ^oves of peace:
But if we once should feel wars stroke
Then would our Joys decreace,
Let men o` Judgment, ponder well
The dangerous State of Arms
And the^ will w^ae a happy peace
More good then (...) allarmes.
How many kingdoms has bin spoyld,
How many Cittyes sacked?
How many valliant men been foyld
How many ships been wrackt?
What bloody m^ssakers and Rapes
What dismal horride deeds?
The ware has both undone and ^e^^
Whilst thousand thousands bleeds.
And true report to Britains brings
What warlike cruel strife
Twixt Denmark and the Sweauian kings
Where thousands lost their life
Till mighty James our Royal Leidge
Did cause the wars to end,
And both these foes gave over their seidge
And each is others friend.
For what the one demanded still
The other still denied:
And Kings contention was the cause
That many subjects dyed.
What Princes speak in heat of blood
In feirce consuming wrath
And seldom can it be withstood
Without their subjects s^ath.
The Royal King of Denmark^ laid
Just claim to certain Land
The which the Sweauian King denayd
And did his force with stand
But after many myseries
And deadly dints of wars
Our gracious Sovereign Lord King James
Did end these bloody Iars.
The second part of the Joyful Peace, concluded between the King of Denmark^
and the King of Sweden, by the means of our most worthy Sovereign, James, by
the grace of God, King of great Britain France and Ireland. etc. To tha tune
of who list to lead a Soldiers life.

Six Articles of consequence,
between them is agreed:
With oaths confirmed between each Prince,
to be performed indeed.
The which conditions of the peace,
in order follow here:
Whereby the cause of all those broils,
to all men may appear.
First that the King of Sweden should,
The City Calman yeald:
Into the King of Denmarkes hands,
(e're further blood be spil'd.)
UUith all the profits of the same*
If he the same would hold
Or else to his commodity,
The City must be sold.
That Elsbach, Otland, two great towns,
and Mensborch, with the land:
And Forces must be all delivered,
to mighty Denmarks hand.
For twelve years space he must enjoy,
Those Castles Towns and Forts,
And now in rest these Princes great,
do flourish in their Courts.
Besides the King of Sweden must,
to end (...) mighty quarrels:
Unto the King o^ Denmark pay,
of gold full fifteen barrells.
For charges of the foresaid wars,
and that their ships at seas,
May p^sse through one another bounds,
and ne man them displease.
That Layland ever shall be free,
without all contribution:
That Greeneland is the Danish Kings,
and give no restitution.
That Denmarks King without all let,
four golden Crowns may bear,
Which was the great and greatest cause,
he first these wars did rear.
Besides some things of smaller note,
betwixt them is decreed:
And so those mighty Christian Kings,
like brothers are agreed.
Thus after many bloody fights,
and many people slain:
The deadly stroke of dangerous arms,
brings blessed peace again.
