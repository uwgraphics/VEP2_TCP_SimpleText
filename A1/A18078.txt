A REPLYE TO AN answer made of M. Doctor VVhitegifre. AGAINST THE ADMONITION
to the Parliament.

By T. C.

ISAIE. 61. ver. 1. For Syons sake / I will not hold my tongue / and for
Ierusalems sake / I will not rest / until the righteousness thereof / break
forth as the light / and the salvation thereof / be as a burning lamp^.

Ver. 6. and. 7. Ye that are the Lords remembrancers / keep not silence / and
give him no rest / until he repair / and set up Jerusalem the praise of the
world.

The Printer to the Reader.
SOme perhaps will marvel at the new impression of this book / and so much
the more will they wonder / because they shall see / that with great confidence
and boldness (notwythstanding our most gracious Princes late published
proclamation / procured rather by the Bishops / then willingly sought for by
her majesty / whose mildnes is such / that she were easyer led to yield to the
proclamation of the highest / then drawn to proclaim any thing against him /
were it not for the subtle persuasions and wicked dealings of this horned
generation / as by their false doctrine and cruel practices is to be seen)
and by the special motion of Gods spirit / and his protection / it has been
both attempted and ended. But cease to muse good christian reader / whosoever
thou art: and learn to know / that no laws were they never so hard and severe
/ can put out the force of Gods spirit in his children / nor any cruelty /
though it stretched it self so far / as to sheding of blood (from which kind
of dealing the Bishops are not clear (as the Prysons in London / the Gatehouse
at Westminster. etc. can witness) the Lord for give them and us our sins)
can discharge the saints and servants of the Lord / from going forward in
that which is good. For the profit therefore of the godly and their
instruction / have we hazarded our selves / and / as it were cast our selves
into such dangers and troubles as shall be laid upon us if we come into ye
hands of the persecuting Bishops. From the which pray the Lord if it be his
will to deliver us / if not / yet that it would please him to give us both
patience / to bear what so ever he shall give them power and lyberty to lay
upon us / and constancy also to continue in his truth and the profession
thereof / unto our lives end. Farewell in the Lord and praise God for this
work.

To the Church of England, and ALL THOSE THAT LOVE THE TRVETH IN IT, T. C.
wishes mercy and peace / from God our father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.
AS our men do more willingly go to warfare / and fight with greater courage
against strangers / then against their countrymen: so it is with me in this
spiritual warfare. For I would have wyshed that this controversy had been with
the Papystes / or with other (if any can be) more pestylent and professed
enemies of the church: for that should have been les grief to write / and
more conuement to persuade that which I desire. For as the very name of an
ennemy does kyndle the desire of fyghting / and stirs up the care of
preparing the furniture for the war: So I can not tell how it comes to
pass / that the name of a brother staketh that courage / and abateth that
carefulnes which should be bestowed in desence of the truth. But seeing the
truth ought not to be forsaken for any man's cause / I enforced my self /
considering that if the Lord might lay it to my charge / that I was not for
certain considerations so ready as I ought to have been to publyshe the truth
/ he might more justly condemn me / if being oppugned and slaundered by others
/ I should not according to that measure which he has dealte unto me / and for
my small habylitie defend it / and deliver it from the evil report that some
endeavor to bring upon it. And as unto other parts of the gospel / so sone as
the Lord opens a door for them to enter in / there is for the most part great
resistance: so in this part concerning the government and dyscipline of the
church / which is the order which God has left / as well to make the doctrine
most effectual / and to give as it were a sharper edge unto the preaching of
the word / as also to be a wall to keep it / and make it continue among us / I
see there be sundry lettes / which do as it were with weapons stand up to
stop the passage / and to hinder that it should not be settled amongst us.
With the which albeit I wrestle hand to hand in this book / yet for as much
as we have all drunk so deep of the cup of untruth / that we do not only
stumble at blocks / which other men lay in our way / but oftentimes we gather
lettes unto our selves in framyng a prejudice against the truth: I thought good
to note shortly what those stumbling blocks are / and although I can not
remove them / yet to give warning of them / and to lend my hand to the weaker
and simpler sort to help to ouerstride them.

The offenses which are taken herein / be either in respect of the cause / or
in respect of those / which seek to defend / and promote the cause. The cause
is charged first with newnes / and strangenes / then as author of confusion /
and of disorder / and last of all as enemy to princes / magistrates / and
common wealths. For the first / besides that it is no sufficient challenge / to
say it is new and strange / there is no cause why it should be counted new /
which is confessed of those which mislyke it / to have been for the most part /
used in the Apostles times / nor why it should be esteemed strange / which is
used now far / and near / of this and that side the sea / and of no
strangers / but of those which are of the household of faith. And it shall more
largely appear in this Book / that this is no innovation / but a renouation /
and the doctrine not new / but renewed / no stranger / but borne in Sion /
whereunto (it being before unjustly banyshed) ought now of right to be
restored.

And of confusion and dysorder it is yet more untruly accused. For justice may
be as well accused for doing wrong / as this doctrine / for bringing in
disorder / whose whole work is to provide / that nothing be done out of place
/ out of time / or otherwise / then the condytion of every man's calling will
bear: which puts the people in subjection under their gouernoures / the
gouernoures in degree / and order one under an other / as the Elder /
underneath the Pastor / and the Deacon / underneath the Elder / which teaches
/ that a Particular church / shall give place unto a Provincial synod / where
many churches are / and the Prouincial / to a National / and likewise that /
unto the General / if any be / and all unto Christ / and his word. When on
the contrary part / those which stand against this doctrine / are thereby
compelled to bring into the church great confusion / and marvelous disorder /
whilst the pastors office is confounded with the deacons / whilst women do
minister the sacraments / which is lawful only for men: whilst private men do
that / which belongs unto public persons: whilst public actions / are
done in private places: whilst the church / is shuffled with the common
wealth: whilst civil matters / are handled by Ecclesiastical persons / and
Ecclesiastical / by those which be civil: and to be short / whilst no
officer of the church keeps his standing / and one member does take upon it /
the office of an other. Which things as they hazard the arm / and destroy the
body: so they do presently hinder / and will shortly (if remeady be not
provided) utterly overthrow the church. And therefore onles good order be in
that which was brought into the church by poperye / and confusion in that which
was left unto the church by the Apostles / and that it be order / that public
actions / should be done in private places / by private persons / and by women
/ that is appointed to be done by men / and confusion / when the contrary is
observed / and finally / onles order / have an other definition or nature /
then hitherto has been read / or heard of / there is no cause / why this
doctrine which contains the discipline / and government of the church /
should be thus shamefully slaundered with confusion / and disorder.

For the third point / which is / that it is an enemy to magistrates / and the
common wealth: if it be enough to accuse without proof / to say and show no
reason / innocence it self shall not be giltles. This doctrine was in times
past / even by their confession / which write against it / a friend unto
princes and magistrates / when princes / and magistrates were enemies unto it:
and can it now be an enemy unto princes / and magistrates / which are friends
unto it? It helped / and vpholded the common wealths / which were governed by
tyrants / and can it hinder those / which are governed by godly princes? And
in what is it an ennemy to princes / and magistrates? Note the variance / set
down the enemitie. If the question be / whether princes / and magistrates be
necessary in the church / it holds / that the use of them / is more then of
the sun / without the which the world ca^ not stand. I fit be of their honor
/ it holds / that with humble subnussion of mind / the outward also of the
body / yea the body it self / and all that it has / if need so require / are
to be yielded / for the defense of the prince / and for that service / for the
which the prince will use them unto / for the glory of God / and maintenance of
the common wealth. If it be asked of the obedience due unto the prince / and
unto the magistrate / it answeareth that all obedience in the Lord / is to be
rendered: and if it come to pass / that any other be asked / it so refuses /
that it disobayeth not / in preferring obedience to the great God / before that
which is to be given to mortal man. It so resists / that it submits the
body / and goods of those that profess it / to abide that which God will have
them suffer in that case. And if it be showed / that this is necessary for the
church / it can not be / but profitable for the common wealth: nay the profit
of it / may easly appear / for that by the censures / and discipline of the
church / as they are in this book described / men are kept back from
committing of great disorders of stealing / adultry / murder. etc. whilst the
smallest faults of lying / and uncomely jesting / of hard and choleric
speeches / which the magistrate does not commonly punish / be corrected. And
undoubtedly / seeing that the church / and common wealth / do embrace / and
kiss one an other / and seeing / they be like unto Hypocrates twins / which
were sick together / and well together / laughed together / and weeped
together / and always like affected: it can not be / but that the breaches of
the common wealth / have proceeded from the hurtes of the church / and the
wants of the one / from the lackes of the other. Neither is it to be hoped for
/ yt the common wealth shall flourishe / until the church be reformed. And it
is also certain / that as the church shall every day more / and more decay /
until it be made eauen with the ground / onles the walls be builded / and the
ruins repaired: so the weight of it (if it fall) will either quite pull down
the common wealth / or leave it such / as none which fear God / will take any
pleasure in it. For seeing Solomon says / ye Prouer. 8. 15.
by wisdom (which is the word of God) kings do govern / and princes do bear
rule / it can not be / but as ye wisdom is either contemned / neglected / or
otherwise abridged of her free and full course / so princes / and magistrates /
and consequently their common wealths / either go to wrack / or decay / or
at the least / want so much of their flourishing estate / as there wants of
that word of God / which he has appointed to be their stay. And howsoever
(before the coming of our savior Christ) amongst the Athenians /
Lacedaemonians / and Romans / and since his coming in diverse places / where
this wisdom has not been heard of / there may seem to have been some shows
of either flourishing / or tolerable common wealths / yet neither have those
endured / but according to the prophesye of * Daniel / have been broken all to
pieces: so that there is not so much of them left / 2. Chap. 34.
as a sheerde to fetch fire in / neither yet can those kingdoms / which have
the knowledge of the gospel revealed unto them / look for that long suffering /
and patience of God toward them / wherewith these ignorant kingdoms have
been borne with. For as the benefit is greater toward these / then toward
the other / so is the judgment swifter against them / then against the other
/ if that grace which was not offered unto them (being offered unto these) be
refused / and made light of. And in these especially is / and shall be
fulfilled / that which the Prophet * Esaias says / that it shall be in the later
days / that every nation and kingdom 60. chap. 12.
which shall not serve the church shall be destroyed / as of the other side / the
full / and whole placing of our savior Christ in his throne / is the perpetual
stay / and stayed perpetuity of all princes in their seats. And therefore / if
this book shall come / into the hands of any / that have access unto her
majesty / the head of this common wealth / or unto her most honorable counsel
/ the shoulders thereof / my humble suit / and hearty request / in the presence
of God is / that according as their callings will suffer them / they will put
them in remembrance of these things / which otherwise they know better then I /
and that they would set before them / the example of Moses / who was not
contented to have brought the people out of Egypt / 3. Deuteronomy. 25.
but would very feign also / have conducted them into the land of Canaan: that
is / would gladly have been the instrument / of the full / and whole deliverance
of the people. And seeing that the Lord does offer unto them this honor / which
he denied unto his servant Moses / that they would not make themselves gilty
of so great unthankfulness / as will follow of the forsaking of so incomparable a
benefit. That her majesty especially / and her most honorable counsel /
would set before them the example of * David / who although he made a great
reformation / 2. Samu. 7. 2. Psalm. 132.
of those things which were defaced by Saul / yet he was not content / that
the Ark of the Lord / should dwell under a tabernacle / and therefore desired
maruellously / that he might build the temple unto the Lord. And seeing that ye
Lord has granted that unto them which he denied unto his servant / that they
would not be narow / and straight in them selves / seeing the Lord opens the
treasures of his goodness so largely unto them. That they would set before them
/ the zeal of * Zerubbabel / who although he had (after the return out of
captivity) abolished Esra. 3. 3. 10.
idolatry / laid the foundations of the temple / and set up an altar unto god
/ whereupon the morning and evening sacrifice was daily made: yet being
admonished by the Prophet Aggey / that God would not be pleased / unless the
temple Agg. 1. 14.
also were fully builded / did (all fear of the nations round about / and
other busynesses laid aside) cause it forthwith / and with all possible speed
/ to be made an end of. Finally / that it would please them / to consider the
examples of * Josias / 2. kin. 22. 23. 2. kin. 18. 2. Chr. 17.
* Ezechias / and * Iehoshaphat / who are therefore / to their everlasting
commendation praised / of the holy ghost / for that / they made whole / and
through reformations / whereas the honor of other some (albeit they were
otherwise good) is stained / and caryeth the mark of their imperfection / by
this and like exception / that although they did such good things / and such /
yet they left also such / and such undone. Which I do not speak / as though we
had not already / by her majesty especially / and afterward by their honors
hands / received a singular benefit / but that we having the whole / might
have our hearts / and mouths filled with the praise of God / and continue the
possession of that which we have / which otherwise for our unthankful refusal
/ shall be taken away. Wherein as we have especial regard / that the name of
God should be magnified / not by us alone / but by our posterity to the
worlds end: so is it not the smallest part of our care / that her majesty /
and your honors / to whom we are so depely bound / and of whom we have
received so singular benefits of peace / and preaching of the gospel / might
with your successions continue / and flourish amongst us for ever. But the
desire of reformation / and fear of Gods heavy wrath to come upon us / has
carried me further herein / then I purposed. I will therefore make an end of
these points / considering that the untruth of these accusations of newnes and
straungenes / of disorder and confusion / of being ennemy to princes and common
wealths / shall better appear in the discourse of this book.

Emongst ye offenses taken by occasion of those / which prefer this doctrine /
this is the chefest / that comparison being made between those excellent men /
both in virtue / and learning / which suffered for the testimony of the truth
/ and between us / of the one side: Also between the Archbishops / Bishops /
Deanes / and Archdeacons which now are / and us on the other side: it seems
unto many / that it is not like to be good / which was not found out by those
excellent personages / and which being now propounded / by men of no great show
/ is either misliked / or at the least / by no open approbation allowed / of
those which carry greater countenaunces / and be in greater dignities.

Unto the first / although answer is made more at large / in this book / yet I
will add thus much / that as for my part / I confess my self / to be a great
deal inferior unto the least of them: so the omitting of these necessary
things / ought to be no more prejudice against them / or against those that
prefer them / then ye omitting of the celebration of the feast of tabernacles /
so many hundredth years / by so many good high priests / in the reigns of so
many good kings / was prejudicial unto y^ ministers / which caused it to be
celebrated / when the people returned out of their captivity / for it
appears in the book of Nehemias / that ye feast of tabernacles / 8 Chap. 17.
18
which was commanded of the Lord to be celebrated every year / was not
celebrated in such sort / as it was commanded in the law / from the days of
Joshua / the son of Nun / until the return of the people from their
captivity. And yet were there / in this space / diverse both judges / and
kings / both priests / and prophets singularly zealous / and learned. If
therefore the omitting of so necessary a thing / so many hundredth years / by
such godly zealous learned persons / could not bring any prescription /
against the truth: the lack of this necessary discipline / by the space of.
30. years / through the oversight of a few (if they be compared with that
multitude) ought not to be alleged / to keep it out of the church.

The dignity also / and high estate of those / which are not so earnest in
this cause / can not hinder it / if we consider / the wisdom of God / almost
from time to time / to consist / and to show it self most in setting forth his
truth / by the simpler / and weaker sort / by contemptible / and weak
instruments / by things of no value / to the end / that when all men see the
baseness / and rudenes of the instrument / 1. Cor. 1. 27. 28
they might the more wonder at the wisdom / and power of the artificer /
which with so weak / and foolish instruments / brings to pass so wise /
and mighty things. And if men will with such an eye of flesh / look upon
matters / they shall condemn that excellent reformation / under the godly king
Ezechias / which the holy ghost does so highly commend: in which it is
witnessed / that the Levites / 2. Chro. 29. 34 2. Chr. 30. 17.
which were a degree under the priests / were more forward / and more zealous /
then the priests them selves. Yea wherein it is witnessed / that the people were
yet more earnest / and more willing / then either the Levites / or the
priests. Which thing / if ever / is verified in our time. For when I consider
the zeal for religion / which shows it self / in many / as well of the
nobility / and gentry of this realm / as of the people / their care to
continue it / and advance it / their voluntary charges to maintain it / their
liberality toward them / which bend them selves that way / as I do thereby
conceive some hope / of the favorable countenance / and continuance of Gods
goodness toward us: so I can not be but ashamed of mine own slackenes / and
afraid of the displeasure of the Lord / for that those / whose proper work
this is especially / and which should bear the standarde / and carry the torche
unto the rest / are so cold / and so careless in these matters of the Lord.

And I humbly crave / and most earnestly desire of those / which bear the
chief titles in the Ecclesiastical functions / that as we do in part
correct our negligence / by the example of the forwardnes / and readiness of
the people: so they would suffer themselves / to be put in remembrance of their
duties / by us / which are underneath them / and that they would not neglect
this golden gift of Gods grace / in admonishing them / because the Lord does
offer it in a treene / or earthen vessel / but that they would first consider
/ that as * Naaman the Syrian prince / 2. Kin. 5. 4. 14
received great commodity / by following / the advice of his maid / and after
/ of his man: And * Abigael being a wise woman / singular profit / by obeying
the counsel 1. Sam. 25. 18
of her servant: so they may receive oftentimes profitable advertisement / by
those / which are in lower places then they them selves be. Then let them
think that as Naaman was never the les noble / for obeying the voice of his
seruau^ts / nor Abigaell never the les wise / because she listened unto the
words of her man / so it can not deminishe their true honor / nor empaire the
credit of their godly and vncounterfait wisdom / if they give care unto that
/ which is spoken by their inferioures.

And last of all / that as / if they had not listened unto those simple persons
/ the one had pearished in his leprosy / the other had been slain with her
familye: even so / if they shall for any worldly respect of honor / riches / or
fear of being accounted either unadvised in taking this course / or light / or
inconsta^t in forsaking it / stop their cares against this loving Admonition of
the Lord / they provoke his anger / not against their health / or against
their life / but against their own souls / by exercising of unlawful
authority / and by taking unto them partly such things / as belong by no means
unto the church / and partly which are common unto them / with the whole church
/ or else with other the ministers / and governors of the same / whereof I
beseech them humbly to take the better head / for that the judgment of the
Lord will be upon a great part of them / by so much the heavier / by how much /
they have not only believed the gospel / but also have received this grace of
God / that they should suffer for it. So that if they will neither take example
of diverse their superiors the nobles of this realm / nor be admonished by us
of the lower sort (wherein we hope better of them) yet they would remember their
former times / and correct them selves / by them selves. And seeing they have been content for the gospels sake / to quit ye necessary things of this life /
they would not think much / for the discipline / which is no small part of the
gospel (having both things necessary and commodious) to part from that / which
is not only in them superfluous / and has nothing but a vain ostentation
(which will vanish as the shadow) but also is hurtful unto them / and
pernicious unto the church / which thing I do morelargely / and plainly lay
forth in this book.

Another exception against the favorers of this cause / is taken / for that
they propou^d it out of time / which is that the Jews said / that the time was
not yet come to build the Lords house: but it is known / what the * Prophet
answered. 1. Agg. 234.
And if no time were unseasonable / in ye kind of material building / wherein
there be some times (as of summer) more opportune and fit then others: how can
there be any untimely building / in this spiritual house / where as long / as
it is called to day / men are commanded to further this work. And as for
those which say we come to late / and that this should have been done in the
beginning / and cannot now be done / without the overthrow of all / for mending
of a piece: they do little consider / that * S. Paul compares that which is
good in the building 1. Cor. 3. 12. 13
unto gold / and silver / and precious stones / and that which is evil laid
upon the foundation / unto stubble / and hey / and wode. Likewise therefore / as
the stubble and the hey / and the wode be easily by the fire consumed / without
any loss unto the gold / or silver / or precious stones: so the corrupt things
in this building / may be easily taken away / without any hurt / or hinderance
unto that which is pure / and found. And if they put such confidence in this
similitude / as that they will thereby / without any testimony of the word of God
/ stay ye further building / or correcting the faults of the house of the
Lord (which by his manifest commandment ought to be done with all speed)
then besides that they be very uncunning builders / which can not mende the
faults / without overthrow of all / (especially when as the fault / is not in
the foundation) they must remember / that as the mean / which is used to
gather the children of God / is called a building / so is it called a planting.
And therefore as dead twigs / riotous / and superfluous branches / or
whatsoever hinders the grows of the vine tree / may be cut of / without
roting up the vine: so the unprofitable things of the church / may be taken
away / without any overthrow of those things / which are well established. And
seeing that Christ / and Beliall can not agree / it is strange / that the pure
2. Cor. 6. 15.
doctrine of the one / and the corruptions of the other / should cleave so fast
together / that pure doctrine / can not be with her safety / severed from the
corruptions / when as they are rather like unto that part of Daniels image /
which was compounded Cap. 2. 42. 43.
of clay and iron / and therefore could not cleave / or stick one with an other.

It is further said / that the setters forward of this cause / are
contentious / and in moving questions / give occasion to the papists of
slaundring the religion / and to the weak of offense. But if it be found to be
both true which is propounded / and a thing necessary about which we contend /
then has this accusation no ground to stand on. For peace is commended to us
/ with these conditions / * if Romans 12. 18.
it be possible / if it lie in us. Now it is not possible / it lies not in us
/ to conceal the truth / * we can do nothing against it / but for it. It is a
profane saying / of 2. Cor. 10. 8. 2. Cor. 13. 8.
a profane man / that an unjust peace / is better then a just war. It is a
dyuine saying / of an Heathen man / Agathe^d eris head brotoisi: It is good to
contend for good things. The papists have no matter of rejoicing / seeing
they have greater / and sharper controversies at home / and seeing this tends
/ both to to the further opening of their shame / and thrusting out of their
remnantes / which yet remain among us. The weak may not be offended /
considering (ye even in the church of God / and among those of the church)
there has been as great varieties of judgments / as these are. For what
waightier controuersyes can there be / then whether we shall rise again or no
/ whether circumcision were necessary to be observed of those which believed?
And yet the first / was amongst ye church of the * Corinthes / the other was
first in * Jerusalem and Antioche / and after in 1. Cor. 15. Act. 15. 1. 2 Gal.
3. 3.
the churches of * Galatia / and yet they the churches / and that the true
relygion / which was there professed. And it is to be remembered / that these
controuersyes for the most part / are not between many. For sundry of those
things / which are comprehended in the answer to the Admonition / have (as I
am persuaded) few favorers / of those especially / which are of any stayed /
or sounder judgment in the scriptures / and have seen / or red of the
government / and order of other churches: so that in deed (the father of that
answer excepted) we have this controversy oftentimes / rather with the
papists / then with those which profess the gospel / as we do. And whereas
last of all / it is said / that this proceeds of envy / of singularity / and
of popularitie / although these be no sufficient reasons against the truth of
the cause / which is neither enuyous / singular / nor popular / and although
they be such / as might be severally / by great lykelyhodes / and probalyties
refuted / yet because the knowledge of these things / pertayneth only to God
which is the searcher of the heart and raynes / and for avoiding of too Act. 1.
24.
much tediousness / we will rest in his judgment / tarry for the day wherein
the secrets of hearts shall be made manifest. And yet all men do see / how
unjustly we be accused of singularity / which propound nothing / that the
scriptures do not teach / the writers both old / and new for the most part
affirm / the examples of the primitive churches / and of those which are at
these days confirm.

All these accusations / as well against the cause / as the favorers thereof /
albeit they be many and diverse / yet are they no other / then which have been
long since in the Prophets / Apostles / and our savior Christ's / and now of
late in our times objected against the truth / and the professors thereof. And
therefore / as the sun of the truth then appeared / and brake through all
those clouds / which rose against it / to stop the light of it: so no doubt
this cause / being of the same nature / will have the same effect. And as all
those slanders could not bring the truth in disgrace / with those that loved
it: so the children of the truth / through these untrue reports / will neither
leave the love of this cause / which they have already conceived: nor yet cease
to enquire dyligently / and to judge indifferently / of those surmises / which
are put up against it.

Moreover / seeing that we have once ouercomed all these lets / and clymed over
them / when they were cast in our way / to hinder us from coming from the
gross darkness of popery / unto the glorious light of ye gospel: there is no
cause / why now they should stay our course to further perfection /
considering / that neither the style is higher now / then it was before (being
the very self same objections) and in all this time / we ought so to have
grown in the knowledge of the truth / that in stead of being then able to
leap over a hedge / we should now have our feet so prepared by the gospel /
that they should be as the fecte of a hynde / hable to surmount even a wall if
need were.

The sum of all is: that the cause may be looked upon with a single eye /
without all miste of partiality / may be heard with an indifferent care /
without the wax of prejudice: the arguments of both sides / may be waighed /
not with the chaungeable waightes of custom / of time / of men / which
notwithstanding (Popish excepted) shall be showed to be more for the cause
then against it: but with the just balances of the incorruptible / and
unchangeable word of God.

And I humbly beseech the Lord / to increase in us the spirit of knowledge /
and judgment: that we may discern things which differ one from an other /
and that we may be sincere / and without offense / until the day of Christ.

The author to the reader.
I Am humbly to crave at thy hand (gentill reader) that thou would vouchsafe
dyligently and carefully to compare M. Doctors answer / and my reply / both
that thou may the better understand the truth of the cause / and that the
untempered speches (of him especially that whyppeth other so sharply for them)
which I have in a manner altogether passed by / and his lose conclusions / which
I have (to avoid tedyousnes) not so fully pursued may the better appear.
Which thing as I crave to be done through the whole book / so chefely / I
desire it may be done in the beginning / where the reader shall not be able so
well to understand what is said of me / unless he have M. D. book before
him. The cause of which diversity / rose of that / that I first purposed to
set down his answer before my reply / as he did the admonition before his
answer. But afterward considering that (his book being already in the hands
of men) it would be double charges to bye it again: and especially weighing
with my self / that through the slownes of the prynt / for want of help / the
reply by that means should come forth later / then was convenient (for
although he might commodyously bring in the admonition / being short / yet the
same could not be done in his book / swellyng in that sort which it does.) I
say / these things considered / I changed my mind / and have therefore set
down the causes / which moved me so to do / because I know / that those (if
any be) which have determined to continue their foreiudged opynions against the
cause / whatsoever be alleged / will hereupon take occasion to surmyse / that
I have left out his answer / to the end / that it might the less appear /
wherein I have passed over any weight of his reasons: where as / had it not
been for these causes which I have before aledged / my earnest desire was / to
have set his answer before my reply: whereof I call the Lord to witness /
whom I know to be a sharp judge against those / which shall abuse his holy
name to any untruth.

An answer to the whole Epistle to the Church.
WHat causes either pulled you forward / or thrust you backward / to write / or
not to write / and how in this dispute / with your self / in the end you were
resolved to write in this sort / I leave it unto the judgment of the Lord /
who only knows the secrets of the heart / and will in his good time unseal
them. But if there be any place of conjecture / the hatred of contention /
which you set down / as the first and principal cause / that beat you back
from writing / might well have been put / as the last and least / or rather none
at all. For if peace had been so precious unto you (as you pretend) you would
not have brought so many hard words / bitter reproaches / enemylike speeches
(as it were sticks and coals) to double / and treble / the heat of
contention. If the sharpnes of the Admonition misliked you / and you think
they outreached in some vehemence of words / how could you more effectually
have confuted that / then to have in a quiet and mild spirit set them in the
way / which (in your opinion) had left it? now in words condenming it / and
approving it in your deeds / I will not say / that you do not so much mislike
this sharpness / as you are sorry / that you are prevented / and are not the
first in it: But this I may well say unto you / which he said: Quid verba
audiam, cum facta videam? what should I hear words / when I see the deeds? In
the fourth reason / whereby you were discouraged to write / if by backbiters /
and unlearned tongs / viperous kind of men / not able to judge of
controversies / carried away with affections / and blind zeal into diverse
sinister judgments / and erroneous opinions / you mean all those / that
think not as you do in these matters: I answer for my self / and for as many
as I know of them / that they are they / which first desire (so it be truly)
to hear / and speak^ all good of you. But if that be not / through your
perseverance / in the maintenance of the corruptions of this church (which you
should help to purge) then the same are they / that desire / that both the
evil which you have done / and that which you have yet in your heart to do /
may be known / to the less discredit of the truth and sincerity / which you
/ with such might and main do strive against. Touching our unlearned tongues
/ we had rather a great deal / they were unlearned / then they should be as
theirs / * which have taught their tunges Iere. 9. 5.
to speak falsely. And how unlearned so ever you would make the world believe /
that we / and our tunges be / I hope (through the goodness of God /) they
shall be learned enough / to defend the truth / against all the learning that
you shall be able to assault it with. If those be the * generation of Christ /
which you call Is. 53. 8.
viperous kind of men: know you that you have not opened your mouth against
earth / but you have set it against heaven / and for all indifferent judgment
/ it will easily perceive / that you are as far from the spirit of * John
Baptist / as you Mat. 3. 7.
are nere to his manner of speech. Which you use / whether it be affection / or
blind zeal / that we follow / and are driven by / it will then appear / when
the reasons of both sides / being laid out / shall be wayed indifferently.
Whereas you say / that your duty toward God / and the Queen her majesty /
moved you to take this labor in hand / it will fall out / upon the
discourse / that / as you have not served the Lord God in this enterprise and
work of youres / so have you done nothing less / then any godly duty /
which you owe unto her Majesty: so / that the best that can be thought of you
herein / is / that wherein an evil matter / you could yield no duty / yet
now you have done that / which you thought a duty / which iudgeinent / we
will so long keep of you / until you shall by oppugning of a known truth /
declare the contrary / which we hope will not be. What truth it is / that we
impugn / and you defend / let it in the name of God appear / by our several
proufes and answeares of both sides. And / as for the slanderous surmises /
whereby in your third and last consideration / you set the Papists of the one
side of us / and the Anabaptists of the other / and us in the midst /
reaching out our hands (as it were) to them both: first it ought not to be
strange unto us miserable sinners / seeing that the Lord him self / without
all sin / was placed in the midst of two grievous malefactors / as though he
had been worse / then they both. Then for answer of those slanderous speeches
/ I will refer the Reader to those places / where these general charges /
are given out / in more particular manner.

An answer to that which is called a brief examination of the reasons used in
the Admonition to the Parliament.
IF the scriptures had been applied to the mayntenaunce of the abomination of
the mass / and some other of the grossest of antichristianitie / you could
have said no more / nor used vehementer speech then this / that they are most
vntollerably abused / and unlearnedly applied. And then where is charity /
which Pro. 10. 12.
covers the multitude of faults / especially in brethren / when you do not
only not cover them / but also take away their garments / whereby they are
covered. I will not deny / but that there be some few places quoted / which
might have been spared / but there are a great number / which (M. Doctor)
tosseth and throws away so lightly / which he shall perceive to sit nearer
him / then he is / or at the least someth to be aware of. And to bring to pass
that y^ quotations in the margent might appear to the reader more absurd / M.
Doctor has besides the advantage which he takes of the faults of the Printer
/ used two unlawful practisies especially. Whereof the one is / that where as
the admonition does quote the scripture / not only to prove the matters which
it handles / but sometimes also to note the place from whence the phrase of
speech is taken. M. Doctor does go about to make his reader believe / that
those places which be alleged for proof of the phrase / are quoted for proof
of the matter. The other practice is / that where the Admonition (for the
shortness which it promises / and was necessary in that case) could not apply
the places / M. Doctor presuming too much of the ignorance of his reader /
thought he might make him believe / that any thing else was meant by those
places / then that which they meant in deed / and for which they were
alleged. And where you say the quotations are only to delude such. etc. I see
you hold it no fault in your self / which you condemn so precisely in others
/ that is / to judge before the time / to sit in the conscience / to affirm
definitely of their thoughts / contrary to their own protestation. But seeing
you lift up our imperfections so high / and set them as it were upon a stage
for all men to be looked of / to the discredit of the truth which we do
maintain: You shall not think much / if your poverty be poynted unto / in
those things wherein you would carry so great countenance of store. For the
arguments them selves / they shall be seen what they be in their places / so
shall also that be answered / which M. Doctor brings here for ye Confutation
/ being straightway after / and in sundry other places repeated in this book.
I will touch that which is not repeated / and that is / that M. Doctor makes
it an indifferent thing / for men / and women to receive ye supper of the Lord
clothed / or naked. This sauoureth strongly of the sect of ye Adamites.

S. Paul which commends the preservation of godlynes and peace / unto 1. Tim.
2. 2.
the cyuill magistrate / does also commend unto him the prouyding / that
honesty be kept / and M. Doctor makes it an indifferent thing / to come either
naked / or clothed unto the Lords table: verily there is small honesty in
this. And if the heathen which knew not god / did account it a filthy thing for
a stage player to come upon the stage without a sloppe / how much more filthy
is it / for a Christian / to come naked unto the Lords table? and the contrary
thereof / is necessarily collected of the scripture / notwithstanding that M.
Doctor says otherwise. They which have heard M. Doctor read in the schools
can tell / that he being there amongst learned men / never used to reduce the
contrary arguments of the adversaries / to the places of the fallacions / and
yet that was the fittest place for him to have showed his knowledge in /
because there they should have been best understood: now that he professes him
self to be a doctor of the people / which because they have not learned these
things / can not understand them / he dasheth out his Logic. What may be
probably gathered hereof / I leave to every man's consideration: this is certain
/ that circumstances of place and persons / which he so often urges / are not
well observed of him / when Logike speaks in the church / and is mute in the
schools: when things are handled more learnedly amongst the people / and more
popularly amongst the learned. It is truly said / cakon esti to calon, en ti
me kairoutiche. A good thing is evil / when it comes out of season. But to
observe what Art here is showed / I would gladly know what place of the fall
actions / either an argument ab authoritate negative is / or of negatiues by
comparison. Aristotle setting forth places / whereunto all fallacions may be
called / makes no mention of these / and if these were fallacions / and were
such as he imagines them / they should be referred unto the former place / ab
eo quod est secundum quid, ad id quod est simpliciter, for these reasons / the
scripture has it not / therefore it ought not to be / or the minister was
known by doctrine / therefore by doctrine only / and not by apparel: If I say
they be fallacions / they be referred unto that place / and whether they be or
no / and also how corruptly / and otherwise then is meant they be gathered / it
shall afterward appear. In the mean season in a small matter / here is a
great fault / not only to invent new places / but of one place to make three /
and may as well make a thousand.

And to the end the pithe and weight of M. Doctors arguments may be the
better seen / I will likewise give the reader a say of them / noting the
places of the fallacions / whereunto they be referred. Which I do against my
will / and compelled / for that master Doctor to discredit the truth / would
make his reader believe / that those which think not as he does in these
matters / are not only unlearned / but contenurers of all good learning. In
deed there is no great learning in these final things / and they are of that
sort / which although it be a great shame not to know / yet it is no great
commendation to have knowledge of them.

In the 40. page he reasons thus. The ministers must learn / therefore they
must learn Catechismes: which is a fallaction of the consequent. For although
he that must learn a Cathechisme / must learn: yet it follows not / that
whosoever must learn / must by and by learn a Cathechisme.

In the. 55. page he reasons / that for so much as the cyuill magistrate may
appoint some kind of apparel / therefore he may appoint any / and so the
popish apparel. Which is / ab eo quod est secundum quid, ad id quod est
simpliciter: of which sort he has diverse others. As women may baptize / and
preach / because such a one / and such a one did. And the ministers execute
cyuill government / because Elias / and Samuel did.

In the. 69. page he says. Cyprian (speaking of the office of an archbishop)
which is a manifest petition of the principle. For it being that which should
have been proved / M. Doctor takes it for granted. And in diverse places
speaking of the archbishop / he goes about to deceive his reader with the
fallation of the aequiuocation, or diverse signification of the word. For
whatsoever he finds said of archbishop and bishop in times past / he brings
to establishe our archbyshops and bishops: when notwithstanding those in times
past / were much different from ours / and are not of that kind / as shall
appear afterward.

In the. 239. page he reasons / that for so much as those which wear the
apparel / do edify / therefore they edify by reason of the apparel / which
is to make that the cause / which is not / but only comes with the cause.

In the. 240. page he reasons thus / that the surplice. etc. be notes / and
notes of good ministers / therefore they be good notes of ministers / which is
a fallacion of compositio^ / when a man thinks that whatsoever is said of a
thing by it self / may be said of it when it is joined with an other.

In the. 149. page he reasons thus / those which authorized the book of
Common prayer / were studious of peace / and building the church / therefore
those which find fault with it / are pullers down of the church / and
disturbers of the peace / which is a fallacion of the Accident, when a man
thinks that every thing which is verified of the Subject, may be likewise
verefied of that which is annexed unto it. The further confutation of which
arguments I refer unto their places.

There be diverse other which he has / which are so far from just conclusions
/ as they have not so much as any color of likelyhode of argument / which I
can not tell where to lodge / unless I put them in the common Inn / which is
that / which is called the ignorance of the Elench. as in the. 69. page / when
he concludes thus / that Cyprian speaks not of the bishop of Rome / ergo he
speaks of an archbishop.

And in the. 71. page. There must be superioures / ergo, one minister must be
superior unto an other. There must be degrees / therefore there must be one
archbishop over a province.

And in the. 73. there was one over every congregation / therefore there was
one over all the ministers in the province. These / and a number like unto
these / M. Doctor has scattered throughout his book / which as Nero said of
his master Senecas works / cleave together like sand / and thus let it be seen
/ whose arguments are most justly concluded / those of ye admonition / or these
of M. Doctors.

An answer to the exhortation to the eyuill Magistrates.
IT is more the^ I thought could have happened unto you / once to admit into your
mind / this opinion of Anabaptisme of your brethren / which have always had
it in as great detestatio^ as your self / preached against it / as much as
your self / hated of the folowers and favorers of it / as much as your self.
And it is yet more strange / that you have not doubted / to give out such
slanderous reports of them / but dare to present such accusations / to the
holy and sacred seat of justice / and thereby (so much as in you lies) to
corrupt it / and to call for the sword upon the innocent / (which is given for
their mayntenance and safety) that / as it is a boldness intolerable / so
could I hardly have thought / that it could have fallen into any / that had
carried but the countenance and name of a professor of the gospel / much les
of a doctor of dyuinitie. Before you will join with us in this cause / you will
place us / whether we will or no / in the camp of the Anabaptists / to the
end you might thereby / both withdraw all from ayding us / which are godly
minded / as for ye you fearing (as it seems) the insufficiency of your pen /
might have the sword / to supply your want other ways. And if we be found in
their camp / or be such disturbers of the quiet estate of the church /
defacers of such as be in authority / maintayners of licenciousnes and lewd
liberty (as you do seem to charge us with) we refuse not to go under those
punishments / that some of that wicked sect received / for just recompense of
their demerites. You say you will not accuse any / I know it is for want of no
good will / that you do not accuse them / of whose condemnation and extreme
punishment / we might be sure / if your hand were as strong as your heart. But
you suspect the authors of the admonition / and their fautors. * Charity is
not suspicious. Let us therefore see / 1. Cor. 13. 5.
whether there be just matter to bear out / and to uphold this suspicion. You
will bear men in hand / that if we be not already full Anabaptists / yet we
are in the way thither / the footesteps whereby you trace us / must be
considered.

To the first article.
It is all true you here allege of the Anabaptists: God be praised / there is
nothing of it / true in us. If through these questions moved / the church be
disquieted / the disquietnes rises in that the truth and sincerity which is
offered / is not received. We seek it in no tumultuous manner / but by humble
suit unto them / to whom the redress of things pertayne / and by teaching as
our callinges will suffer. If all those are to be counted in the way to
Anabaptisme / which move controversies when the gospel is preached: Then those
that taught that ye Gentilles were to be preached unto / when as the most of
the believing Jews (which Act. 11. 19.
likewise preached the gospel) thought otherwise / are to be counted in the
way to Anabaptisme. Likewise / those that preached that circumcision was not
necessary unto salvation / when as a great number of Christians at the first /
thought it necessary. Then master Zuinglius and Oecolampadius smelled of
Anabaptisme / which went about to overthrow diverse things / which master
Luther held. I could go further with this / but I content my self with these
examples. If any be brought in doubt / or hatred of the truth hereby / or any
man take occasion to be contentious / it is not in the nature of the doctrine
which is taught / but in the corruption of their minds / nor it is not offense
given / but taken: nor this doctrine can be no more charged / then the rest of
the gospel / which is a * sword / Math. 10. 34. Luke 12. 49.
that cutteth a city / or kingdom in sunder / and sets a * fire where
there was none / and puts contention between the father and the son. But
what is to give an incurable offense unto the simple / and matter to the enemy
to rejoice in / to all good Christyans of tears and weeping / if this be not:
to make the world think / that numbers of those which profess the gospel /
are infected with the poison of Anabaptisme / which can not be touched with the
smallest point of it? As for the magistrate / and authority / we acknowledge ye
lawfulnes / necessity / and singular commodity of it / we comme^d it in our
sermons to others / we pray for them / as for those / of whose good or evil
estate / hangs the flourishing or decay of the common wealth / and church
both. We love them as our fathers and mothers / we fear them / as our Lords
and masters / and we obey the^ in the Lord / and for the Lord. If there be any
thing / wherein we do not according to that which is commanded / it is /
because we can not be persuaded in our consciences / that we may so do (whereof
we are ready to render a reason out of the word of God) and if that will not
serve / forthwith to submit our selves / to that punishment / that shall be
awarded against us. And herein / we first call the Lord God to witness of our
meaning / and then we refer our selves to the consciences of all men in the
sight of God.

To the second Article.
There was never heretic so abominable / but that he had some truth to cloak
his falshode / should his untruths and blasphemies / drive us from the
possession of that / which he holds truly? no not the Devil him self
(saying / that * God had given his angels charge over his) can thereby wring
this sentence Psalm. 91. 11. Math. 4. 6.
from us / why we should not both believe it / and speak it / being a necessary
truth to believe / and speak. You may as well say / we are Anabaptists / because
we say / there is but one God / as they did / one Christ / as they did. etc.
And here I will give the reader a taste of your Logike / that you make so much
of in your book.

The Anabaptists say that the churches ought to choose their minister / and not
the magistrate.

And you say so.

Therefore you are Anabaptists / or in the way to Anabaptisme.

The Anabaptists complained that the Christians used not their authority in
excommunication.

And so do you complain.

Therefore you are Anabaptists / or in the way to them.

I will not lay to your charge / that you have not learned Aristotle's Priorums
/ which says / it is asystaton, as often / as the mean in any syllogism / is
co^sequent to both the extremes. But have you not learned that / which Seton /
or any other halfepenny Logik tells you / that you can not conclude
affirmatively in the second figure? and of this sort / are every one of your
surmises contained in this Treatise / which you entitle an exhortation. etc.
And if I liked / to make a long book of little matter (as you do) I would thus
gather your arguments out of every brasich which you ascribe / as common unto
us with the Anabaptists / as you make ado / upon every place / which is quoted
by the admonition to the Parliament. But answer I pray you / in good faith /
are you of that judgment / that the civil magistrate should ordain
ministers? Or / that there should be no excommunication / which we know was in
the primitive / and is used in certain the Heluetian churches? If you be /
your controversy is not so much with us / as with the bishops / which both call
ministers / and excommunicate. If you be not / why is that Anabaptisticall in
us / which is christian and catholic in you? and why do you go about / to
bring us in hatred for those things / which you do no more allow / then these /
whom you thus endeavor to discredit? We do not say that there is no lawful /
or no ordinary calling in England / for we do not deny / but that he may be
lawfully called / which is not ordinarily / as M. Luther / Melancthon /
Zuinglius / Oecolampadius. etc. and there be places in England / where the
ministers are called by their parishes in such sort / as the examples of the
scripture do show to have been done / before the eldershyp and government of
the church be established. I know not any / that says / that the gospel is not
truly preached in England / and by those also that are not of the same
judgment / that the Admonition to the Parliament is of. But if it be said /
that it is not generally of every one of them / and in all points / or not so
often / or not there / where their duty binds them / and they are called
unto / or not so sincerely / or without mixture / as it ought to be / then
there is nothing said / but that / which we fear / may be too easily proved.
If it be said of some / that in certain there are found some of those things
/ that were reprehe^ded in the Phariseis / what is that to prove / that they be
Anabaptists y^ speak it. Your self in one place of your book / call the
authors of the Admonition and their favorers / Phariseis / who do all things
to be seen of men / and therefore they sighe / and hold down their heads.
etc. and this you speak / against them that preach the gospel. Therefore by
your reason you give sentence of Anabaptisme against your self. You promised
you would not write one word / whereof you had not your author for it. First
you have perverted the meaning of the Anabaptists / in that wherein they
accused the godly ministers / that they were not according to that which is
written in the third of the first Epistle to Timothe / and all because you
would multiply the no^bre of your likelyhodes. For they charged the ministers /
by that place / of dissolutenes and losenes of life / and corruption of manners
/ and we allege it to prove that they should be able to teach and instruct /
against ye dumb ministry that is abroad. But that which follows / utters
not only great untruth and falsification of the author / but shows a mind
desirous to slander / and sorry (as it seems) that those which you so
grievously discredit / are no liker the Anabaptists / then they be. I will
set down the words / as they are written in the. 102. leaf / that it may
appear how faithfully you have dealt. Libere enim dicunt concionatores qui
stipendium accipiunt, non esse veros Dei ministros, neque posse docere
veritatem, sed esse ventris ministros, qui otiose accipiant ingentia stipendia,
ex illis rebus, que simulachris immolate fuerunt, and ex diuitiis splendide and
luxuriose viuant, cum tamen Christus dixit, gratis accepistis, gratis date, and
prohibuit duas tunicas, peram and pecuniam habere. Preterea Paulum aiunt
manibus suis laborasse, and mandasse reliquis, vt idem faciant, itaque
concludunt nulla debere stipendia habere sui officii, sed laborare and gratis
ministrare, and quiahoc non faciunt, non posse ipsos veritatem docere. They say
freely (speaking of the Anabaptists) that the preachers which take stipends /
can not be the true ministers of God / nor teach the truth / but are
ministers of the belly / which to live idly take great stipendes / of those
things which were offered to images / and do of their riches live gorgeously
and riotously / when notwithstanding Christ said / ye have received freely /
give freely / and for bad them to have two coats / or a scrip / or money.
Besides that / they say that Paul labored with his own hands / and gave
commandment / to the rest of the ministers / that they should do so / and
therefore they conclude / that they should have no stipende for their office /
but labor and minister for naught / and because they do not so / they can
not teach the truth. Now / let all men judge / whether it be one thing / to
say / that they ought not to have stipends / that labor not / or to say / as
the Anabaptists said / that it was not lawful to have any stipende / or to say
/ they could not teach truly / because they had great livings / or because
they had any livings at all. Although I never red / nor heard any of those /
that you mean / say / that those which had great stipends and livings / could
not preach truly. It may be / that diverse have said / that it were meet / the
ministers should be content / with competent stipends / and that the overplus
of that / might go to the supply of the wants of other ministers livings / and
to the maintenance of the poor / or of the university / and that that exces /
is the cause of diverse disorders in those persons / that have it / but that
they could not preach truly (when they preached) which had great livings / I
for my part / never heard it. I think you would not be exempted from
reprehension of that / wherein you fault / and therefore I know not what you
mean by these words (ye they did not those things them selves / which they
taught others) we profes no such perfection in our lives / but that we are
oftentimes behind a great deal / in doing of that which is taught to be our
duties to do / and therefore think it necessary / that we should be
reprehended / and showed our faults. Whereas you say / that the Anabaptists
accused the ministers / for giving too much to the Magistrates / I have showed
what we give / and if it be too little / show us / and we will amend our fault.
I assure you / it greueth me / and I am even in the beginning weary / of
turning up this dunge / and refuting so vain and frivolous slanders / without
all show and face of truth / and therefore I will be brief in the rest.

To the third.
We praise God for this reformation / so far forth / as it is agreeable unto
the word of God / we are glad the word of God is preached / that the sacraments
are ministered / that which is wanting / we desire it may be added / that which
is ouermuche / cut of / and we are not ashamed to profes / that we desire /
it may be done / according to the institution of the churches in the Apostles
time. You your self confess / that excommunication is abused: that no amendment
of life appears since the preaching of the gospel / is an old and general
complaint of all godly ministers in all churches / and in all tunes. * Esaias
preached this / in ye church / Esaias. 5. 1. etc. Psalm. 12. 1. Psalm. 14. 3.
and of the whole church / and further that they brought for the rotten fruit.
David / that the faithful people were deminished out of the la^d / that there
was none that did good / no not one. And diverse other of the Prophets / have
made greuouser complaints / and great charges against the people of God / and
yet were no Anabaptists / nor in the way to Anabaptisme. If there be none /
that either have written or spoken that the church of England / is no more the
true Church of Christ / then the papisticall church / then besides that there
is no truth in your tongue / there seems to be no shame in your forheade /
if there be any / it stands your good name in hand / that you bring them out.

To the fourth.
If some of those which favor this cause / have been ouercaryed in part / to do
things which might have been more conveniently ordered / it is against reason
that you should therefore charge those / which favor this cause that you
oppugn. You would think you had wrong / if because some of those that favor
that which you favor in this matter / be either free will men / or hold
consubstantiation in the Sacrament / you should be challenged as free will men /
or maintainers of consubstantiation. If those metings / which they had / were
permitted unto them / by them / that have authority / I see nothing / why they
may not seek to serve God in purity / and les mixture of hurtful ceremonies:
If they were not permitted / yet your name of conuenticles / which agreed to
the Anabaptists / is too light and contemptuous / to set forth those
assemblies / wherein I think you will not deny / but that the word of God and
his sacraments were ministered / and take you heed / that these so reproachful
speeches / which you throw out against men / reach not unto God: A softer word
would have better becommed you.

To the fifth.
I answer as unto the last clause of the third article.

To the sixth.
We pretend it not / but we propound it / and herein we call God to witness
against our own souls.

To the seventh.
If you do not these things (which we say not) we will rather do the^ with the
Anabaptists / then leave them undone with you. Of our simple heart and meaning
in the^ / we have before proteste^. In ye mean season / we will patiently abide
until the Lord bring our * righteousness in this behalf unto light / and our
lust Psalm. 37. 6.
dealing as the none day. Touching our sighing / and seldom or never laughing
/ you give occasion after to speak of it / unto the which place I reserve ye
answer.

To the eight.
We are no Stoikes / that we should not be touched with the feeling of our
grefes / if our complaints be excessive / show them / and we will abridge
them. What errors we defend / and how you maintain your part by the word of
God / it will appear in the discourse of your book.

To the ninthe.
Their finding fault without cause in the ceremonies of baptism / can not
bar us / from finding fault / where there is cause. We allow of the baptism
of children / and hope through the goodness of God / that it shall be far
from us / ever to condemn it. But to let your slanderous tongue go (all the
strings whereof ye seem to have losed / that it may the more freely be thrown
out / and walk against the innocent.) Where / where is the modesty you require
in other / of not entering to judge of things unknown / which dare insinuate to
the magistrate / that it is like they will condemn childrens baptism / which
do baptize them / preach they should he baptized / and which did never by
syllable / letter / or countenance / mislike of their baptism?

To the. 10. 11. and. 12.
I answer as unto the fifth / and for further answer / I will refer the reader
to those places / where occasion shall be given to speak of these things
again.

To the. 13.
This is a branch of the. 8. and added for nothing else but to make up the
tale.

To the. 14.
We fear no shedding of blood in her majesty's days / for maintaining that
which we hope we shall be able to prove out of the word of God / and wherein we
agree with the best reformed churches / but certain of the things which we
stand upon are such / as that if every hear of our head were a life / we ought
to aforde them for the defense of them. We brag not of any the least
ability of suffering / but in the fear of God / we hope of the assistance of
God his holy spirit to abide / whatsoever he shall think good to try us with
/ either for profession of this / or any other his truth whatsoever.

To the. 15.
We make no separation from the church / we go about to separate all those
things / that offend in the church / to the end that we being all knit to the
sincere truth of the gospel / might afterward in the same bond of truth / be
more nearely and closely joined together. We endeavor that every church having
a lawful pastor / which is able to instruct / all might be ranged to their
proper churches / whereas diverse / onles they go to other then their own
parishes / are like to hear few sermons in the year / so far are we from
withdrawing men from their ordinary churches and pastors. Let him that
inueigheth against any pastor without good cause / bear the punishment: as for
inueighing against heaping of living upon living / and joining steeple to
steeple / and non residence / and such ambition and tyranny / as bears the
sway in diverse Ecclesiastical persons / if the price of the pacification / be
the offending of the Lord / it is better you be displeased / then God be
offended.

To the. 16.
We stay our selves within the bonds of the word of God: we profes our selves
to be of the nombre of those / which should * grow in knowledge / as we do
Ephe. 4. 13.
in age / and which labor that the image of God may be daily renewed in us /
not only in holiness of life / but also in * knowledge of the truth of God /
and yet I Coll. 3. 10.
know no question moved / which has not ben many years before in other
churches reformed / holden as truth / and therefore practiced / and in our
church also have been some years debated.

To the. 17.
If we defend no falshoode or inconvenient thing / we can not be counted
stubborn or wilful / whereof we offer to be tried by the indifferent reader.
For waiwardnes and inhumanitie / we think it a fault / as we esteem godly
society and affability to be commendable: and what is our behauior herein /
we likewise refer to their judgments / with whom we are conversant / and
have to do with / being misseiudged and untruly condemned of you / we judge
nor condemn no man / their vices we condemn / so far forth as the listes of
our vocation do permit us.

To the. 18.
We allow of commonweals / as without which / the church can not long
continue / we speak not against civil government / nor yet against
ecclesiastical / further then the same is an enemy to the government / that God
has instituted.

To the. 19.
If we give honor and reverence to none / let us not only have none again / but
let us be had as those that are unworthy to live amongst men. I fear there be
of those / which are your favorers / Ecclesiastical persons / that if they
should meet with my Lord Mayor of London / would strain curtesye / whether he
or they should put of the cap first. We give the titles of Majesty / to the
Queen our sovereign / of grace / to Duke and Duches / of honor / to those
which are in honor / and so to every one / according to their estate. If we
miss / it is not because we are not willing / but because we know not always
what pertains unto them / and then our fault is pardonable. For answearing
churlishly / it is answered before in the seventh Article.

To the. 20.
With acknowledging of our manifold wants and ignorances / we dout not also to
take upon us / with thanks giving / that knowledge / which God has given to
every of us according to the measure of faith: we seek not to please our
selves / but the Lord and our brethren / yea all men / in that which is good.
We reverence other men's gifts / so as we think the contempt of them
redoundeth to the giver. Therefore although the common infection be in us / yet
we hope pride does not * reign in our mortal bodies. Psalm. 19. 13. Romans 6. 12.


To the. 21.
We hold that it is no ministers part / to choose his own place where he will
preach / but to tarry until he be chosen of others. Likewise / that he
insinuate not him self / but abide a lawful calling / and therefore this can
not agree to us / but to those rather / which content themselves with a rouing
and wandering mynistery / and defend the ministers own presenting and offering
him self or ever he be called.

To the. 22. and. 23.
I answer as to the fifthe / and touching the. 23. refer the reader to a
further answer in that place / where occasion is offered to speak of it again.

To the. 24.
So far forth as we may (for the infirmities wherwyth we are enclosed) we
endeavor to adorn the doctrine of the gospel / which we profes / we seek not
the admiration of men / if God do give / that we have honest report / we
thyncke we ought to maintain that / to the glory of God and advancement of the
gospel. what is our straightnes of life any other / then is required in all
christians? we bring in (I am sure) no Monachisme or Anchorisme / we eat and
drink as other men / we live as other men / we are apparelled as other men /
we lie as other men / we use those honest recreations that other men do / and
we think there is no good thing / or commodity of life in the world / but
that in sobriety we may be partakers of / so far as our degree and calling
will suffer us / and as God makes us able to have it. For the hipocrisy that
you so often charge us with / the day shall try it. If any man join wych us /
with mind to contend / it is against our will / notwithstanding we know none
/ and what great stirrers and contenders they be which favor this cause / let
all men judge.

To the two next sections.
Do you think to mock the world so / that when you have so unjustly / and
so hainously accused / you may wipe your mouth / and say (as you did before)
that you will not accuse any? and as now / that you will leave the application?
Is not this to accuse / to say / that the authors of the Admonition do almost
plainly profess Anabaptisme? is not this to apply / to say that they agree
with the Anabaptists in all the fornamed practices and qualities? You would
feign strike us / but you would do it in the night / when no man should see you
/ and yet if you have to do against Anabaptists / you need not fear to
proclaim your war against them. You have a glorious cause / you shall have a
certain victory. I dare promise you / that you shall have all the estates
and orders of this realm / to clappe their hands / and sing your epinicia,
and triumphant songs. But that you would convey your sting so privily and
hissingly / as the Adder does / it carries with it a suspicion of an evil
conscience / and of a worse cause / then you make the world believe you have.

From moreover. etc. unto To conclude.
Now you carry us from the Anabaptists in Europe / unto the Donatists in Affrike
/ and you will paint us with their colors / but you want the oil of truth /
or likelyhode of truth / to cause your colors to cleave / and to endure. The
Lord be praised / that your breath / although it be very rank / yet it is not
so strong / that it is able / either to turn us / or change us / into what
forms it pleases you. I shall desire the reader / to look Theod. lib. 4. De
fabulis haereticorum, and Augustine / ad quod vult Deum, and in his first and
second books / against Petilians letters / where he shall find of these
heretics / yt by comparing the^ with these / to whom M. Doctor likeneth the^ /
the smoke of this accusation might the better appear: for these slanders are
not worth the answering. To this division from the churches / and to your
supposed conuenticles / I have answered. They taught that there were no true
churches but in Africa / we teach nothing les / the^ that there is no true
church but in England. If the churches be considered in the parts / whether
minister / or people / there is none pure and unspotted / and this is the faith
of the true Church / and not of the Donatistes: If it be considered in the
whole and general government / and outward policy of it / it may be pure and
unspotted / for any thing I know / if men would labor to purge it. The
Donatists vau^ted them selves to be exempted from sin / and what likelyhode
is there between any assertion of the authors of the Admonition / and this
fansy of the Donatists. To the last point of no compulsion to be used in
matters of religion denying it to be true / I reserve the further answer to
another place.

To the next section.
Solomon says ye the beginning of the words of an unwise man is folishnes /
Eccl. 10. 13.
but the later end of the^ is mere madness: even so it falls out by you: for
whilst you suffer your self to be carried hedlong of your affections / you
hurl / you know not what / nor at whom / what so ever comes first to hand
/ and speak things that the eyes and ears of all men / hear / and see / to
be otherwise. Whilst you compare them to Anabaptists and Donatists / some
friend of yours might think / you said truly / because such always seking
dark and solitary places / might happily have some favorers / which are not
known: But when you join them with y^ papists / which are commonly known to
all men / whose doctrine they impugn / as well as you / whose marks and badges
they can les away with / then you / whose company they fly more then you /
whose punishment they have called for more then you for your part have done /
and therefore are condemned of them as cruel / when you / oftentimes carry away
the name of mildnes and moderation / which forsothe know (as you have
professed) no commandment in the scripture / to put heretics to death: when
I say / you join them thus with papists / you do not only leese your credit
in these untrue surmises / (wherein I trust / with the indifferent reader you
never had any) but you make all other things suspected / which you affirm / so
that you give men occasion to take up the common prouer be against you / I will
trust you no further then I see you.

After you have thus yoked them with the papists / you go about to show wherein
they draw with them. Wherein first I ask of you / if all they that affirm or do
any thing / that the enemies of the church do / are forthwith joined and
conspired with them against the church? what say you to s. Paul that joined
with the * Pharisees in the resurrection / with the false apostles in taking no
* wages Act. 23. 6. 2. Cor. 11. 12. 1. Cor. 9. 6.
of the Corinthians / to our savior Christ / which spoke against the Jews
/ which were then the only people of God / as the Gentiles did which were their
ennemies: will you say therefore / that either S. Paul joined with the Pharisees
or false Apostles / against the church / or that our savior Christ / joined
against the Jews with the Gentiles? but let us see your slanders particularly.

To the first.
They do not deny / but there is a visible church of God in England / and
therefore your saying of them / y^ they do almost in plain and flat terms say
/ that we have not so much as any outward face and show of the true church /
argues yt you have almost no love in you / which upon one word once uttered /
contrary to ye tenure of their book / and course of their whole life / surmise
this of the^: and how truly you conclude of that word (skarce) it shall appear
when we come to that place.

To the second.
I have answered this in ye. 2. article of Anabaptisme ye you charge us with.

To the third.
This also is answered in the third.

To the fourth.
I answer / that they do not condemn it wholely / but find fault with it / as
in some points disagreeing with the word of God.

To the fifth.
All men shall perceive / when I come to that place / how you have racked
their words to an other sense then they spoke them. In the mean season / it is
enough that they confess that reading in the church is godly.

To the sixth.
I have answered in the tenth Article of Anabaptisme.

To the seventh.
I answer that * Doeg / when he said that David came to Abimelech / said Psalm.
52. 1.
nothing but truth / and when they that witnessed against Christ / that he
said / * destroy the temple / and in three days I will build it up again /
said nothing Math. 26. 61.
but that our savior Christ said: But yet Doeg was a slaunderer / and the other
false witnesses: because the one spoke it of mind to hurt / and the other
understood it of an other temple then our savior Christ meant it. So although
you do in part rehearse their words / yet taking them contrary to their
meaning (which might easily appear by the circumstances) I see not how you
can be free from these faults / unless it be done ignorantly / which I wish
were true for your own sake. And here I will desire thee (gentle reader) to
mark with what conscience this man says / that they are joined and
confederate with papists against the church. The papists mislyke of the book
of common prayer / for nothing else / but because it swarueth from their mass
book / and is not in all points like unto it. And these men mislike it / for
nothing else / but because it has too much likelyhode unto it. And judge
whether they be more joined with the papists / which would have no communion
nor fellowship with them / neither in ceremonies / nor doctrine / nor government
/ or they / which forsaking their doctrine / retain part of their ceremonies
/ and almost their whole government: that is / they that separate them selves
by three walls / or by one: they that would be parted by ye broad sea from
them / or which would be divided by narowe water / where they may make a bridge
/ to come in again / and displace the truth of the gospel / as they have
done in times past: They that would not only unhorse the Pope / but also take
away the stirrops / whereby he should never get into the saddle again / or
they which being content with that that he is unhorsed / leave his ceremonies
and his government especially / as stirrops / whereby he may leap up again /
when as occasion serves: They that are content / only to have cut the arms
and body of the tree of antichristianitie / or they which would have stumpe and
root all up.

The last section.
After you have all to be blacked and grimed with ye ink of Anabaptisme /
Donatisme / and Papisme those whom you found clear from the least spot / or
specke of any of them: you whet the sword / and blow the fire / and you will
have the godly magistrate minister of your choler / and therefore in stead of
fear of leesing the multitude of your livings / forgoing your pomp and pride
of men / and delicacy of fare / unlawful jurisdiction / which you have and
hereafter look for / conscience / religion / and establishment of the common
wealth / must be pretended. What / have you forgotten that which you said in
the beginning / that you accused none / but suspected certain? would you have
the sword to be drawn upon your suspicions? But now you see that they who^ you
have accused / are nothing like either Anabaptists / Donatists / or Papists /
and your self most unlike unto him / that you profes to be / and now you see /
that all your slanders are quenched by ye innocencye (as it were by water) of
those men / whom you so hainously accuse: you are to be put in mind / of the
law of God / which decrees / that he ^eu. 19. 18. 19
which accuses an other / if he prove it not / shall suffer the punishment
which he should have done / against whom the accusation had been justly proved.
The Romans did nourish in Capitolio, certain dogs and geese / which by their
barking and gagling / should give warning in the night / of thieves that entered
in: but if they cried in the day time / when there was no suspicion / and when
men came in to worship / then their legs were broken / because they cried /
when there was no cause. If therefore / he have accused justly / then he is
worthy to have his diet allowed him of the common charges. But if otherwise /
we desire not that his legs may be broken (as theirs were.) But this we humbly
crave / that if this our answer do not sufficiently purge us / that we may be
sifted and searched nearer / that if we nourishe any such monstrnous opinions
/ (as are surmised) we may have the reward of them: if we do not / then at the
least / we may have the good abearing / against such slanderous tongues /
seeing that God has not only committed unto the magistrate / the safetye of
our goods and life / but also the preservation of our honest report.

The Reply unto the Answer of the Preface.
IT may be said unto you / that which Aristotle said of a certain
Philosopher / that he knew not his own voice. For if that you had remembered /
that which you do so often promis / that you will not answer words / but matter
/ ye Printer should not have gained so much / men should not have bestowed so
much money of a thing not of so great value / nor that (which is more) the
world should not be burdened with unprofitable writings. For how often tunninges
out have you / to draw the authors of the Admonition into hatred / by
inucighing bitterly against their vnlearnednes / maliciousness? etc. (as it
pleases you to term it) so that if there were any excess of speech in them
/ you have paid it again with measure pressed down / and running over. How
often charge you them with pride / and arrogancy / men that confess once or
twyse of them selves / their want of skill / and which profess nothing of them
selves / but only a bare and naked knowledge of the truth / which may be done
with modesty / even of them which have no learning. And yet those that know
them / know that they are neither void of the knowledge of the tongues / nor
of the liberal Arts / albeit they do not make so many words of it as you. *
Solomon says / that he that is despised / and has Pro. 12. 9.
but one servant / is better / then he which magnifyeth and sets out him
self / and yet wants bread. Whereby he means that the man / that has but
a little / and caryeth his countenance accordingly / is much more to be
esteemed / then he which bears a great port / and has not to support it.
These brethren have not undertaken the knowledge of Logike / Philosophy / and
other school learning / whereof notwithstanding they are not destitute: you /
in so often reproching them / with the ignorance of them / would make us
believe / that you are so notable a Logician and Philosopher / as if Logike and
Philosophy had been borne with you / and should dye with you: when as it may
appear / partly by that which has been spoken / and partly by those things
that will fall out hereafter / that you are better acquainted with the names of
Logike and Philosophy / then with any sound or substantial knowledge of
them. But let that be the universities judgment / where you have been brought
up / and are best known. To return to your unprofitable excursions / how
oftentimes in your book / do you pull at the magistrates sword / and what
sword you would have I leave to the consideration of all men / seeing you are
not satisfied with their imprisonment / whereupon also does ensue the expense
of that which they have. What matter is in all these / that brings any help
/ to the decision of these causes / that are in question between us? how many
leaves have you wasted / in confuting of the quotations / which (you say) are
vain / foolish / unlearned / and to no purpose of that / for which they are
alleged? And if they be so / where learned you / to spend so much time / about
them? Did you never learn / that spoude, ta me spoudes axia, elegchein, ton
atopon esti? to confute trifeling things seriously / is a point of those /
which have no judgment / to know what is meet for the time and place / and
other such circumstances? If I should of the other side now go about to
maintain every place / to be not unfitly quoted / unto that end wherefore it
is alleged / and show how unjust your reprehensions are / and how small cause
you have / to lead them oftentimes / so gloriously in triumph (as you do)
which I assure you / I could do in the most places. (As / what could be more
fitly alleged / to induce to read the book / then that they should * try all
things? what more fitly / to hold men from 1. These. 5. 21. Ia. 1. 19. 20.
rash condemning of things / then that they should be * slow to speak? what
more fitly / to move that they should not misselike of the goodness of the cause
for the simplicity or base degree of them that defend it / then / that we *
should not have Ia. 2. 1.
the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ / in respect of persons? and what more
unjustly done / then that you should whippe them / for the printers fault / in
putting one place for an other). If I say / I should thus go about / to make
good every place / how evil should I deserve / either of learning / or of the
truth it self / in blotting of much paper / whereby no profit would come to
the reader? And if the days of a man / were as many / as the days of an Oak /
I would neither willingly trouble / nor be troubled / with such strife of
words. Seeing therefore / God has shut us in so narow terms / me think /
men should have conscience of pestoring the world / with such unprofitable
treatises.

Therefore all these / and whatsoever else wandering words / I shall meet /
with in this book / I mean (by God his grace) as dead things / and nothing
worth / to bury with silence / and will answer to those things / which touch
the matters that lie in controversy between us. And as for the vnlearnednes /
blind zeal / malice / intolerable pride / contempt of al good orders / and
twenty such more things / wherewith M. Doctor charge us / if our life and
conversation does not confute the^ sufficiently / our words and profession of
our selves / will not do it. And therefore / we will first stay our selves with y^
testimony of our own consciences / and the^ in the equity of ye judgment of
al those / which shall indifferently consider these things / y^ we are charged
with. And as for ye sword / that is so hotly and hastily called for / we hope
it be in their hands / which will use it better / then they are by you directed.

To come therefore unto the matter / out of the places of the. 20. of Matthew /
and the 22. of Luke where our savior Christ / upon occasion of the inordinate
request of the sons of Zebede / puts a difference / between the civil and
ecclesiastical function / he places the distinction of them in two points /
whereof the one is / in their office / the other is in their names and titles.

The distinction of the office he notes / in these words / the kings of the
Gentiles have dominion over them / and the princes exercise authority over
them / but it shall not be so with you. Whereupon the argument may be thus
gathered. That / wherein the civil magistrate is severed from the
ecclesiastical officer / does not agree to one minister over an other. But the
civil magistrate is severed from the ecclesiastical officer / by bearing
dominion. Therefore bearing dominion does not agree to one minister over an
other.

Touching their names and titles / he puts a difference in these words. And
they are called gracious Lords / but it shall not be so with you. And so the
argument may be framed as before / that for as much as they are severed in
titles / and that to the civil minister does agree the title of gracious
Lords / therefore to the Ecclesiastical minister the same does not agree. For
as it is fit / that they whose offices carry an outward majesty and pomp
should have names agreeable to their magnificence: so is it meet / that those
that God has removed from that pomp and outward show / should likewise be
removed from such swelling and lofty titles / as do not agree with the
simplicity of the ministry which they exercise. And whereas it might seem
somewhat unjust: that he that has the greater gifts / should not be
preferred to those which have less / our savior Christ shows that the
matter is far otherwise. For by how much every man does excel his fellow in
the gifts of the holy ghost / by so much more / he ought to employ him self
to the benefit of others: so that in a manner he should become (as it were)
their servant to do them good. Which although it be in part common to the
civil magistrate with the minister of the word / yet he does never let down
him self so low / nor gives his service either to the church or common wealth
/ but that he does and ought in that service to retain that dignity and
countenance / with the marks and notes thereof / which his princely estate
does require.

In the end / he propounds him self for example / in whom he sets before
their eyes / a perfect pattern of ye ministry. For seeing he being Lord /
took upon him to be a servant / and being Emperor and king of heaven and
earth / was content to want all the glory and show of the world (his ministry
so requiring) it should be great shame for them which were his disciples /
chosen out for the ministry / not to content them selves / but to aspire unto
such offices and dignities / as they dreamed of.

Against this is said / that the places do nothing else but condemn ambitious
desire and tyrannical usage of authority / and does not bar the ministers
of these things.

Then be like all those godly and learned men / which have used these places *
The bishop of Salsbury so alleges this place in his defense of the Apology
against master Harding. page 653.
to prove that the Pope which professes him self to be an ecclesiastical
person / ought not to have the civil sword / nor to usurp unto him self
such glorious pomp / have abused them. For you teach him how he should
answer / that there is nothing forbidden but ambition and tyranny / and in
deed this is the answer of all the Papists to that objection.

But Musculus a learned man is of ye judgment. And M. Calvin (as learned as he
with diverse other) are of that judgment that I have alleged. This is no great
proof of your side / nor reproof of ours / let us therefore see the reasons
wherewith this exposition is warranted. Musculus reason is this / that if he
should have meant that the Apostles had been equal and none greater then an
other / then there should be equality of all / and none should have authority
over other. And so there should be no degrees of the Prince and subject in the
common wealth / of master and servant in a family / of people and minister in
ye church. But it is no good reason to say / there is / nor ought to be / any
inequality amongst the apostles / therefore there is none / nor ought to be
none at al: Or to say there is no mequalitie amongst the pastors / therefore
there is no inequality between the pastors and the people. For as common
wealths / families / and churches / are preserved by inequality / and in that
some are higher / and some are lower / some rule / and some obey: so are the
same likewise preserved by equality of certain amongst them selves. As for
example / albeit the Consuls in Rome / were above other offices / and the people
/ yet were they equal between them selves. And although it be the preservation
of the family / that the master should be above the sernaunt / and the father
above the son: yet it tends also to the quiet of the house that the
servant amongst them selves / and the brethren amongst them selves / should
be equal. And so we grant / that for the preservation of the church / it is
necessary that there be some should bear rule / and other should be under
their rule: but I deny / that thereof follows / that one minister should
bear rule over an other. Whereas M. Musculus says that Peter was found in
many places chief amongst the rest / if he mean as Eusebius, lib. 2. cap. 14.
does / which says / that he was tes aretes eneka ton Ioipon apostolon
proegoron for his virtues and gifts he had / one that spoke before the rest /
and in the name of the rest / (which he seems to do in that he does not
absolutely give any chefetie unto him but only in certain places) I agree with
him / and do not deny / but such chiefetie may be amongst the ministers / as
shall appear more at large hereafter.

This interpretation of M. Musculus (master D. says) must needs be true / or
else Christ should reject Princes and Magistrates / emongst both Christians and
other. I have showed how it does not follow that / because he forbids y^
rule unto the ministers / therefore he forbids it simply and altogether: no
more then the law which forbids that any stranger should be king of the
realm / for bids therefore that there should be no king of the realm.
Whereas you say master Musculus teaches how he ought to rule which rules /
and what he ought to be / I have told you before / other think otherwise: and
therefore you having set down his judgment before / needed not to have
repeated it here again. But the Greek words (you say) catakyrieuousin kai
catexousiazousin do signify to rule with oppression / and why may not I say
that this preposition cata, does not signify here a perverseness of rule /
but an absoluteness and a full power and jurisdiction as catamathein,
catalambanein is not to learn / or to perceive euilly and peruersly / but to
learn exactly / and to perceive thoroughly and perfectly? but what need we to
follow conjectures in so plain a matter? when as Saint Luke uses the simple
words without any composition of exousiazein Kai Kyrieuein? do you not
perceive that the preposition wherein you put so great confidence / deceives
you / besides the manifest untruth you commit in saying / that all three
Evangelists have katexousiazousin and katakyrieuousin. Furthermore you say /
that our savior Christ says not / that no man shall be great amongst them /
but he that desires to be great amongst them. He had said so before when he
had said it shall not be so amongst you / and therefore needed not to repeat
it: and yet an other Evangelist says not / he that desires to be great / but
let the Luke 22. 26.
greatest among you / be as the least. VVherby he does not reprehend only the
desire of being great / but will not have them to be one above an other.

To the last reason.
Last of all you conclude that our savior Christ in the 20. of Matthew /
reproves the ambition of the sons of zebede / and in the 22. of S. Luke all
the rest of the Apostles. I grant you / he does so / and that could not be
done better / then in tellyng them / that they desired things not meet for
them / and which would not stand with their calling. And if as you say the
ambition only was reprehended / and the desire of rule to oppress others with
/ the answer you attribute to our savior is not so fit. For they might
have replied and said that he forbad tyrannical rule and oppression of their
inferioures / but they desired that which was a moderate and well ruled
government. And seems it unto you a probable thing / that S. Luke means
tyrants and oppressors / when as he says / they are called beneficial or
gracious Lords? men do not use to call oppressors / liberal or bountiful
Lords. Neither is it to be thought of all the Apostles / that they desired
rule one over an other / to the end that they would use cruelty / or tyranny
/ or oppression / one over an other: for that were to do them great injury.
Besides that it is said / that the rest of the disciples disdayned at the two
brethren / which they would not have done / if they had had any purpose or
mind to have oppressed them. For then they would have contemned them / rather
then have disdayned them / if they had broken out into such gross faults. For
Aristotle teaches that nemesis (which is the same that aganactesis is / the In
his rethor. ad Theod.
verb whereof the Evangelist uses) is against those / that are supposed of
them that bear the disdain / to be lifted up higher and into better estate
then they are worthy of: which agrees with that interpretation which I have
alleged / and can not agree with the other / which you set down. For who
(speaking properly) would speak after this sort. The residue of the Apostles
disdayned at the two brethren / or thought them unworthy that they should bear
tyrannical rule over them.

To the section that begins touching the place in. 23. of Matthew / and so
until how aptly.
Concerning the exposition and sense of that place / I agree with you / and
suppose that it is quoted of the authors of the admonition / rather to note the
ambition of certain / which gape greedely at these byshopprickes which we have
/ to the end they might be saluted by the name of Lords / and honors /
then to prove that one minister should not have dominion over an other. And
therefore although these places be against no lawful authority of any estate
or condition of men / yet as they are aptly alleged against the bishop of Rome
/ the one against his estate and authority simply / the other against his
tyranny and evil usage of him self in that authority: so it may be aptly
alleged against any other / which shall fall into the like fault of the bishop
of Rome. The pureness that we boast of / is the innocence of our savior
Christ / who shall cover all our vnpurenesse / and not impute it unto us. And
for so much as faith * purifyeth the heart / Act. 15. 9.
we doubt not / but God of his goodness has begone our sanctification / and hope
that he will make an end of it / even until the day of our Lord Jesus.

Albeit we hold diverse points more purely then they do / which impugn them:
yet I know none that by comparison / has either said / or written / that all
those that think as we do in those points are more holy / and more
unblameable in life / then any of those that think otherwise. If we say / that
(in those points which we hold from them) we think soundlier then they do:
we are ready to prove it. If we say also / that we live not so offensiuely to
the world commonly / by getting so many lyuinges into our hands / as would
find four or five good learned able ministers / all the world will bear us
witness. Other pureness we take not upon us. And therefore / as the name was
first by the Papists maliciously invented: so is it of you very unbrotherly
confirmed. Whereas you say / that they are Puritanes / which suppose the church
which they have devised / to be without all impuritie: if you mean without
sin / you do notably slander them / and it is already answered: If you
mean / that those are Puritanes or Catharans / which do set forth a true and
perfect pattern or platform of reforming the church / then the mark of this
heresy reaches unto those / which made the book of common prayer / which you
say is a perfect and absolute rule to govern this church / wherein nothing is
wanting or too little / nor nothing running over / nor too much. As for the
Catharans (which were the same that are otherwise called Nouatians) I know no
such opynion they had / and they whom you charge / are as far from their
corruption as you be.

An answer to that which is contained in the. 20. 21. and 22. page / until.
Now if either godly Councels.
YOu give occasion of suspicion / that your end will be skarce good / which
have made so evil a beginning. For whereas you had gathered out of the
Admonition / that nothing should be placed in the Church / but that God has in
Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Deuteronomy. 12. 32.
his word commanded / as though the words were not plain enough / you will
give them some light / by your exposition. And what is yt? you answer that it
is as much as though they would say / nothing is to be tolerated in the church
of Christ / touching either doctrine / order / ceremonies / disciplyne / or
government / except it be expressed in the word of God. Is this to interpret?
is it all one to say: nothing must be placed in the church: and nothing must be
tolerated in the church? he has but small judgment / that can not tell / that
certain things may be tolerated and borne with for a time / which if they
were to be set in and placed / could not be done without the great fault of
them that should place them. Again / are these of like weight / except it be
commanded in the word of God: and except it be expressed in the word of God?
Many things are both commanded and forbidden / of which there is no express
mention in the word / which are as necessarily to be followed / or avoided / as
those / whereof express mention is made. Therefore unless your waightes be
truer / if I could let it / you should waighe none of my words. Hereupon you
conclude / that their arguments taken ab authoritate negative, prove nothing.
When the question is of the authority of a man / in deed it neither holds
affirmatively nor negatiuely. For as it is no good argument to say / it is not
true because Aristotle or Plato said it not: so is it not to say / it is true
/ because they said so. The reason whereof is / because the infirmity of man
can neither attain to the perfection of any thing / whereby he might speak all
things that are to be spoken of it / neither yet be free from error in
those things / which he speaks or gives out / and therefore this argument /
neither affirmatively / nor negatiuely / compels the hearer: But only
induces him to some liking or misliking of that / for which it is brought /
and is rather for an orator to persuade the simpler sort: the^ for a disputer
to enforce him that is learned. But for so much as the Lord God / determyning
to set before our eyes a perfect form of his church / is both able to do it
/ and has done it / a man may reason both ways necessarily. The Lord has
commanded / it should be in hy^ church: therefore it must. And of the other
side / he has not commanded: therefore it must not be. And it is not hard to
show / that the Prophets have so reasoned negatiuely. As when in the person
of the Lord the Prophet says / * whereof I have not spoken / and which never
entered into my heart: and as where he ^7. Iere. 31. 32 30. Esa. 2.
condemns them / * because they have not asked counsel at the mouth of the
Lord. But you say / that in matters of faith and necessary to salvation it
holds / which things you oppose afterward and set against matters of
ceremonies / orders / discyplyne and government: as though matters of
dysciplyne and kind of government were not matters necessary to salvation /
and of faith. The case which you put / whether the bishop of Rome be head of
the church / is a matter / that concerns the government / and the kind of
government of the church / and the same is a matter that touches faith / and
that stands upon our salvation. Excommunication / and other censures of the
church / which are forerunners unto excommunication / are matters of dysciplyne
/ and the same are also of faith and of salvation. The sacraments of the
Lord his supper / and of baptism are ceremonies / and are matters of faith
and necessary to salvation. And therefore you which distinguishe between these
/ and say / that the former / that is matters of faith and necessary to
salvation may not be tolerated in the church / unless they be expressly
contained in the word of God or manyfestly gathered: But that these later
which are / ceremonies / order / disciplyne / government in the church / may
not be received against the word of God / and consequently received if there be
no word against them (although there be none for them) you I say distinguishing
or dyuiding after this sort / do prove your self to be as evil a deuyder /
as you showed your self before an expounder / for this is to break in pieces
/ and not to divide.

And it is no small injury which you do unto the word of God / to pin it in
so narow room / as that it should be able to direct us / but in the principal
points of our relygion: or as though the substance of religion / or some rude
and unfashioned matter of building of the church were uttered in them, and
those things were left out / that should pertayne to the form and fashion of
it: or as if there were in the scriptures only to cover the churches nakedness
/ and not also chains and bracelettes and rings / and other jewels / to adorn
her and set her out / or that to conclude / there were sufficient to quench her
thirst / and kill her honger / but not to minister unto her a more liberal /
and (as it were) a more delicious and dainty diet. These things you seem to
say / when you say / that matters necessary to salvation and of faith are
contained in the scripture / especially when you appose these things / to
ceremonies / order dysciplyne / and government.

And if you mean by matters of faith and necessary to salvation / those
without which a man cannot be saved: then the doctrine that teaches there is
no free will / or prayer for the dead / is not within your compass. For I
doubt not / but diverse of the fathers of the Greek church / which were great
patrons of free will (at lest as their words pretend) are saved holding the
foundation of the faith / which is Christ. The like might be said of a number
of other / as necessary doctrines / wherein men being nusled / have
notwithstanding been saved. Therefore seeing that the point of the question
lies chiefly in this distinction / it had been good that you had spoken more
certainly and properly of these things.

But to the end it may appear / that this speech of youres / does something
take up and shrink the arms of the scripture / which otherwise are so long
and large: I say that the word of God contains the direction of all things
pertaining to the church / yea of what soever things can fall into any part of
man's life. For so Solomon says / in the second chapter of the Proverbs. My
son / if thou ^. Cha. 9.
receive my words / and hyde my precepts. etc. Then thou shall understand
justice and judgment / and equity / and every good way. S. Paul says that 1.
Cor. 10. 31.
whether we eat or drink / or whatsoever we do / we must do it to the glory
of God. But no man can gloryfy God in any thing but by obedience / and there is
no obedience but in respect of the commandment and word of God: therefore it
follows that the word of God directs a man in all his actions. And that
which S. Paul said of meats and drinks that they are sanctified unto us by 1.
Tim. 4. 5.
the word of God / the same is to be understood of all things else
whatsoever we have the use of. But the place of S. Paul is of all other most
clear / where speaking of those things which are called indifferent / in the
end he concludes / that whatsoever is not of faith / is sin: but faith is
not but in respect of the 14. Romans 23.
word of God / therefore whatsoever is not done by the word of God / is sin.
And if any will say that S. Paul means there a full plerophorian and
persuasion that that which he does is well done / I grant it. But from whence
can that spring but from faith / and how can we persuade and assure our selves
/ that we do well / but whereas we have the word of God for our warrant? so
that the Apostle by a metonimie Subiecti pro adiuncto, does give to understand
from whence the assured persuasion does spring. Whereupon it falls out / ye
forasmuch as in all our actions both publyke and private we ought to follow ye
direction of ye word of God: in matters of the church and which concern all /
there may be nothing done but by the word of God. Not that we say / as you
charge us in these words (that no ceremony. etc. may be in the church except
the same be expressed in the word of God) but that in making orders and
ceremonies of the church / it is not lawful to do what men list / but they
are bound to follow the general rules of the scripture / that are given to be
the squire / whereby those should be squared out. Which rules I will here set
down / as those which I would have as well al orders and ceremonies of the
church framed by / as by the which I will be content / that all those orders and
ceremonies which are now in question / whether they be good and convenient or
no / should be tried and examined by. And they are those rules / which Paul
gave in such cases as are not particularly mentioned of in scripture.

The first / that they offend not any / especially the Church of God. 1. Cor.
10. 32. 1. Cor. 14. 40.
The second / is (that which you cite also out of Paul) that all be done in
order and comclynes. The third / that all be done to edifying. 1. Cor. 14. 26.
14. Romans 6. 7.
The last / that they be done to the glory of God.
So that you see that those things which you reckon up / of the hour / and
time / and day of prayer. etc. albeit they be not specified in the scripture /
yet they are not left to any / to order at their pleasure / or so that they be
not against the word of God: but even by and according to the word of God they
must be established: and those alone to be taken / which do agree best and
nearest with these rules before recited. And so it is brought to pass (which
you think a great absurdity) that al things in the church should be appointed
according to the word of God. Whereby it likewise appears / that we deny not
but certain things are left to the order of the church / because they are of
the nature of those which are varyed by times / places / persons / and other
circumstances / and so could not at once be set down and established for ever:
and yet so left to the order of the church / as yt it do nothing against the
rules aforsayde. But how does this follow / yt certain things are left to ye
order of the church / therefore to make a new ministry by making an Archbishop
/ to alter ye ministry ye is appointed / by making a bishop or pastor without
a church or flock / to make a deacon without appointing him his church whereof
he is a deacon / and where he might exercise his charge of providing for ye pore
/ to abrogate clean both name and office of ye elder with other more: how I
say does it follow ye because the church has power to order certain things /
therefore it has power to do so of these / which God has ordained and
established: of the which there is no time / nor place / nor person / nor any
other circumstance / which can cause any alteration or change? Which thing
shall better appear both in the discourse of the whole book / and especially
there / where you go about to show certain reasons / why there should be other
government now / then was in ye time of the apostles. But while you go about
to seem to say much / and rake up a great number of things / you have made
very evil mestin (and you have put / in one / things which are not paires nor
matches. Because I will not draw the reader willingly into more questions then
are already put up / I will not stand to dispute / whether the Lords day
which we call Sunday (being the day of the resurrection of our savior Christ /
and so the day wherein the world was renewed as the Jews sabbath was the day
wherein the world was finished / and being in all the churches in the Apostles
times as it seems used for the day of the rest and serving of God) ought or
may be changed or no. This one thing I may say / that there was no great
judgment to make it as arbytrarie and chaungeable / as the hour and the place
of prayer. But where was your judgment / when you wrote / that the scripture
has appointed no discipline nor correction for such / as shall contemn the
common prayers and hearing the word of God? What church discipline would you
have other then admonions / reprehensions / and if these will not profitte
excommunication? and are they not appointed of our savior Christ. 18. Math.
15. 16. 17. 22. Chap. 20.
There are also civil punishments / and punishments of the body likewise /
appointed by the word of God in diverse places / in Exodus. He that sacrifices
to other gods / and not to the Lord alone / shall dye the death. And in
Deutcronomie. Thou shall burn out the evil out of the midst of thee / that
the rest may 19. Chap. 19.
hear and learn and not dare do the like. The execution of this law appears
in ye Chro. by king Aza / who made a law / that all those that did not seek ye
Lord should 2. Chr. 15. 13.
be kilde. And thus you see ye civil punishment of conte^ners of ye word and
prayers.

There are other for such as neglect the word / which are according to the
quantity of the fault: so that whether you mean civil or ecclesiastical
correction / the scripture has defined of them both. I omit that there be
examples of pulpits in Nehemias which the common translation calls Ezra / of
chaires in S. 8. Chap. 4. 23. Chap. 2.
Matthew / where / by the chair of Moses our savior Christ meaning the
doctrine of Moses / does also declare the manner which they used in teaching:
Of sitting at the communion (which the Evangelist notes to have been done of
our Math. 26. 20.
Savior Christ with his disciples) which examples are not to be lightly
changed / and upon many occasions.

But this I can not omit / that you make it an indifferent thing to preach
the word of God in churches or in houses / that is to say / privately or
publicly. For what better interpretation can I have / then of your own words
/ which say by and by after / of Baptism / that it is at the order of the
church / to make it private or public. For if it be in the power of ye church
/ to order that Baptism may be ministered at ye house of every private person /
it is also in her power to ordain that the word / be preached also privately.
And then where is that which Solomon says that wysdom cries openly and in the
streates / and at the corners 8. Prou. 2. 3.
of the streets where many meet: and where be the examples of the old church
/ which had besides the temple at Jerusalem / erected up synagogues in every
town to hear the word of God / and mynister the cyrcumcysion? what is become
of the commandment of our savior Christ / which * wylled his discyples 10.
Math. 27.
that they should preach openly / and upon the house tops / that which they
heard in the ear of him / and secreately? and how do we observe the example
of our savior Christ / who to deliver his doctrine from all suspytion of
tumultes 18. Ioh. 20.
and other dysorders / said that he preached openly in the temple and in the
synagogues / albeit the same were very dangerous unto him? and the example of
the 3. Act. 1. 4. Act. 1.
* Apostles / that did the same. For as for ye time of persecution / when the
church dare not / nor is not meet / that it should show it self to the
ennemy / no not then is the word of God nor the sacraments privately preached
or ministered / neither yet ought to be.

For although they be done in the house of private man / yet because they are
and ought to be ministered in the presence of the congregation / there is
neither private preaching / nor private baptism. For like as where so ever the
Queens majesty lies / there is the Court / although it be in a Gentleman
his house / so wheresoever the church meets / that place is not to be holden
private / as touching the prayers / preachings / and sacraments / that shall be
there ministered. So that I deny unto you that the church has power to
ordain at her pleasure / whether preaching or ministering of sacraments /
should be private or public / when they ought not to be / but where the
church is / and the church ought not to assemble (if it be not let by
persecution) but in open places. And when it is driven from them / those places
where it gathers it self together / although they be otherwise private / yet
are they for the time that the churches do there assemble / and for respect of
the word and sacraments / that are there ministered in the presence of the
church / public places. And so you see those (whom you charge slanderously
with conuenticles) are feign to glase up the windows that you open to secreate
and private conuenticles.

The Answer from. Now if either godly councels / unto I trust M. Caluins
judgment will weigh.
Here are brought in Justin Martyr / Ireneus / Tertullian / Cyprian / and
councels / as dumme persons in the stage only to make a show / and so they go
out of the stage without saying any thing. And if they had had any thing to say
in this cause for these matters in controuersye / there is no doubt / but M.
Doctor would have made them speak. For when he places ye greatest strength of
his cause in antiquity / he would not have passed by Justin / Ireneus /
Tertullian / Cyprian / being so ancient / and taken Augustine / which was a
great time after them. And if the godly councels could have helped here / it
is small wisdom to take Augustine / and leave them. For I think he might
have learned that amongst the authorities of me^ / the credit of many is
better then of one: and that this is a general rule / that as the judgment of
some notable personage is looked unto in a matter of debate / more then theirs
of the common sort / so the judgment of a council / where many learned men
be gathered together / caryeth more likelyhode of truth with it / then the
judgment of one man / although it be but a provincial council / much more
then / if it be a general / and therefore you do your cause great injury / if
you could allege them / and do not. This is once to be observed of the reader
throughout your whole book / that you have well provided that you would not be
taken in the trip for misalledging the scriptures / for that onles it be in one
or two points / we hear continually (instead of Esaias and Jeremy / S. Paul /
and S. Peter / and the rest of the Prophets and Apostles) S. Augustine and S.
Ambrose / kai to en te phake myron, Dionysius Areopagita / And as we say in our
tongue / Nettles among Roses.
Clement. etc. And therefore I can not tell with what face we can call the
papists from their antiquity / councels / and fathers / to the trial of the
scriptures / who in the controversies which rise amongst our selves / fly so
far from them / that it wants not much / that they are not banished of your
part / from the deciding of all these controversies.

And if this be a sufficient proof of things to say / such a Doctor said so
/ such a council decreed so / there is almost nothing so true but I can
impugn / nothing so false / but I can make true. And well assured I am / that
by their means / the principal grounds of our faith may be shaken.

And therefore / because you have no proof in the word of God / we comfort our
selves / assured / that for so much as the foundations of the Archbishop and
Lordship of Bishops and of other things / which are in question / be not in
heaven / that they will fall and come to the ground / from whence they were
taken.

Now it is known they are from beneath and of the earth / and that they are
of men and not of God: The answearer goes about to prove / that they came yet
out of good earth / and from good men / which if he had obtained / yet he may
well know / that it is no good argument to prove that they are good. For as the
best earth brings forth weeds / so do the best men / bring forth lies and
errors. But let us hear what is brought / that if this visarde and show of
truth be taken away / all men may perceive / how good occasion we have to
complain / and how just cause there is of reformation. In the first place of
S. Augustine there is nothing against any thing which we hold / for this / that
the church may have things not expressed in the scripture / is not against /
that it ought to have nothing / but that may be warranted by the scripture.
For they may be according to the scripture / and by the scripture / which are
not by plain terms expressed in the scripture. But against you it makes
much / and ouerturneth all your building in this book. For if in those things
which are not expressed in ye scripture / that is to be observed of the Church
/ which is the custom of the people of God / and decree of our forefathers:
then how can these things be varyed according to time / place / and persons /
(which you say should be) when as yt is to be retained / which ye people of God
has used / and the decrees of the forefathers have ordained. And the^ also how
can we do safelier / then to follow the apostles customs and the churches in
their time / which we are sure are our for fathers / and the people of god.

Besides that / how can we retain the customs and constitutions of the
papists in such things / which were neither the people of God / nor our
forefathers.

I will not enter now / to discus / whether it were well done to fast in all
places according to the custom of the place. You oppose Amb. and Aug. I could
oppose Tertull. de coron. milit. Ignatius ad Ph. epist. 5.
Ignatius and Tertullian / whereof the one says it is (nefas) a detestable
thing to fast upon the Lords day / the other / ye it is to kill the Lord / and
this is the inconvenience that comes of such unlearned kind of reasoning / S.
Ambrose says so / and therefore it is true. And although Amb. and Aug. being
strangers and private men at Rome would have so done / yet it follows not / yt
if they had been citizens and ministers there y^ they would have don it / and if
they had don so to / yet it follows not but they would have spoken against ye
appointment of days / and nomothesian, of 17. chap. of the 5. book. Aug. de
temp. 62. sermon. Amb. 10. lib. ep.
fasting / whereof Eusebius says / that Montanus was the first author. I speak
of that which they ought to have done / for otherwise I know they both thought
corruptly of fasting: when as the one says / it was remedy or reward to fast
other days / but in Lent / not to fast / was sin: and the other asks /
what salvation we can obtain / if we blot not our sins by fasting / seeing yt
the scripture says / ye fasting and alms does deliver from sin / and therefore
calls them new teachers / that shut out the merit of fasting. Which I
therefore recite / because you would seem by Aug. and Ambrose judgments / to
allow of the weekly and commanded fasts. What you mean to cite this place ad
Ianuarium. 118. I can not tell / you charge the authors of the admonition to be
conspired with the papists / I will not charge you so / but will think better of
you / until the contrary do more appear. But I appeal to the judgment of all
men / if this be not to bring in popery again / to allow of s. Aug. saying /
wherein he says that the celebrating of the day of the passion. etc. is either
of some general council / or of the Apostles commanded and decreed / whereby a
gate is open unto the papists to bring in / under the color of traditions /
all their beggary whatsoever. For you plainly confirm / that there is some
thing necessary to be observed / which is not contained any ways in ye
scripture. For to keep those holy days / is not contained in the scripture /
neither can be concluded of any part thereof / and yet they are necessary to be
kept / if they be commanded of the Apostles. Therefore in your opinion / some
thing is necessary to be kept / which is not contained in the scriptures / nor
can not be concluded of them. And if you say / that S. Aug. leaves it in dout
/ whether it were the Apostles tradition and statute / or a general councels /
then you bring us yet to a worse point / that we can not be assured of ye which
is necessary for us to know / that is whether the Apostles did ordain that
these days should be kept as holy days / or the councils. And that it is S.
Augustins meaning / to father such like things Tom. 7. de baptis. contra Donat.
lib. 5. cap. 23.
of the Apostles / it may appear by that which he writes / saying. There are
many things which the whole church holds / and therefore are well believed to
be commanded of the Apostles / although they be not found written. If this
judgment of s. Augustine be a good judgment and a sound / then there be some
things commanded of God / which are not in the scriptures / and therefore there
is no sufficient doctrine contained in the scriptures / whereby we may be saved.
For all the commandments of God and of the apostles / are nedeful for our
salvation.

And mark I pray you whether your affections carry you: before you said / that
the Lords day which was used for the day of rest in the Apostles time / may be
changed / as the place / and hour of prayer: but the day of the passion and
resurrection. etc. you either thrust upon us as the decree of the apostles / or
at least put upon us a necessity of keeping of them / least happily in breaking of
them / we might break the Apostles decree / for you make it to lie between
the councels and the apostles / which of them decreed this. And do you not
perceive / how you still reason against your self? for if the church have had so
great regard to yt which the apostles did in their times / that they kept those
things which are not written / and therefore are doutfull whether ever they used
them or no / how much more should we hold our selves to these things / which
are written / that they did / and of the which we are assured? As touching the
observation of these holy days / I will refer the reader unto an other place /
where occasion is given again to speak of them. As for that rule y^ he gives
when he says whatsoever is not. etc. and for the last of the three rules / I
receive them with his own interpretation / which he has afterward in. 119.
epist. ad Ianuarium, which is / that it be also profitable.

And as for those three rules / which you say / are worthy to be noted / I
can see nothing that they help your cause one whit / for I know no man that
ever denied / but that the church may in such things as are not specified /
and precisely determined / make orders so they be grounded of those general
rules which I have before alleged out of S. Paul.

And as for the second of the three rules / I can not at any hand allow it. For
when all christianity was over run with Popery / things were universally
observed / which to keep / were mere wickedness / and this strengthens the
papists universality.

Concerning your gloss (if it be not repugnant to the scripture) besides that
it is not enough / because it must be grounded by the scripture / and that it
is wicked to give such authority to any decree of men / that a man should not
enquire of it / or reason of it / I have showed that he meant nothing les. For
affirming that such things are the Apostles commandments / his meaning was /
that they should be without all exception received / and absolutely. How much
better is it / that we take heed to the words of the Apostle / then either to
S. Augustins or yours / which says / that if he / or an angel from heaven /
should preach any other Gal. 1. 8.
gospel / then that which he had preached / that they should hold him
accursed: he says not any contrary or repugnant doctrine / but any other
gospel.

But tell me / why passed you by yt in Augustine which he * writes to Iunuarie
Epist. 119.
that those things which are not contained in the scripture / nor decreed of
cou^celles / nor confirmed by general customs / but are varied by the manners
of regions and of men / upon occasion offered / ought to be cut of / although
they seem not to be against faith / because they pres with servile burdens the
religion / which Christ would have free. This sentence belike was to hot for
you / you could not carry it. The rest whose names you recite (which you say
you leave of for brevity sake) I leave to the judgment of the Reader to
consider / wherefore they be left out / seeing that Augustine in whom you put so
great trust / answers so little to your expectation. This is certain / that
brevity (which you pretend) was in small commendation with you / which make so
often repetitions / stuff in diverse sentences of Doctors and writers / to
prove things that no man denies / translate whole leaves to so small purpose /
upon so light occasions / make so often digressions / sometimes against the
vnlernednes / sometimes against the malice / sometimes against the
intemperancie of speech of the authors of the admonition / and every hand while
pulling out the sword upon them / and throughout the whole book / sporting
your self with the quotations in the margent / so that if all these where
taken out of your book / as wind out of a bladder / we should have had it in a
narow room / which is thus swelled into such a volume / and in stead of a book
of.ij. s. we should have had a pamfiet of two pence.

And whereas you say / that you have not alleged these learned fathers for the
authors of the libell / but for the wise / discrete / humble / and learned / to
them also I leave it to consider / upon that / which is alleged by me. First /
how like a divine it is / to seek for rules in the Doctors / to measure the
making of ceremonies by / which you might have had in the scriptures: there /
at the rivers / here / at the fountain / uncertain there / which here are
certain / there / in part false / which are here altogether true / then to
how little purpose they serve you / and last of all how they make against you.

An answer to the end of the. 29. page / beginning at the. 25. at. But I trust
M. Caluins judgment.
Why should you trust that M. Caluins judgment will weigh with them / if they
be Anabaptists (as you accuse them) if they be Donatists / if Catharists / if
conspired with the Papists / how can you think that they will so easily rest
in M. Caluins judgment / which hated and confuted all Anabaptisme / Donatisme
/ Catharisme and Papisme? But it is true which the proverb says / memorem.
etc. he that will speak an untruth had need have a good memory: and this is
the force of the truth / in the conscience of man / that although he suppres
it / and pretend the contrary / yet at unawares it steals out. For what
greater testimonye could you have given of them / that they hate all those
heresies which you lay to their charge / then to say / that you trust M.
Caluins judgment / will weigh with them? Now in deed (that you be not deceived)
we receive M. Calvin / and weigh of him / as of the notablest instrument that
the Lord has stirred up / for the purging of his churches / and of the
restoring of the plain and sincere interpretation of the scriptures / which
has been since the Apostles times. And yet we do not so read his works / that
we believe any thing to be true / because he says it / but so far as we can
esteem / that that which he says / does agree with the canonical scriptures.
But what gather you out of M. Calvin?

First / that all necessary things to salvation / are contained in the
scripture: who denies it?

In the second collection / where you would give to understand / that
ceremonies and external discipline / are not prescribed particularly by the
word of God / and therefore left to the order of the church: you must
understand / that all external discipline / is not left to the order of the
church / being particularly prescribed in the scriptures: no more then all
ceremonies are left to the order of the church / as the sacraments of baptism
/ and the supper of the Lord: whereas / upon the indefinite speaking of M.
Calvin / saying ceremonies and external discipline, without adding / all or
some / you go about subtelly to make men believe / that M. Calvin had placed
the whole external discipline / in the power and arbitrament of the church.
For if all external discipline were arbitrarie / and in the choice of the
church / Excommunication also (which is a part of it) might be cast away /
which I think you will not say. But if that M. Calvin were alive to hear his
sentences racked and wrythen / to establishe those things / which he strove so
mightily to overthrow / and to overthrow those things that he labored so sore
to establishe / what might he say? and the injury which is done to him / is
nothing les because he is dead.

Concerning all the rest of your collections / I have not lightly known a man
/ which takes so much pain with so small gain / and which sows his sede in
the sea / whereof there will never rise increase. For I know none that ever
denied those things / unless peradventure you would make the reader believe /
that al those be contentions / which move any controversy of things which they
judge to be amiss / and the^ it is answered before. And now I answer further /
that they that move to reformation of things / are no more to be blamed as
authors of contention / then the Physician / which gives a purgation / is to
be blamed / for the rumbling and stir in the belly / and other disquietnes of
the body: which should not have been / if the evil humors and naughty
disposition of it / had not caused or procured this purgation.

Whereas you conclude / that these contentions would be sone ended / if M.
Caluins words were noted / here we will join with you / and will not refuse
the judgment of M. Calvin / in any matter that we have in controversy with you.
Which I speak not therefore because I would call the decision of controversies
to men / and their words (which pertain only to God and to his word) but
because I know his judgment in these things to be clean against you / and
especially for that you would bear men in hand / that M. Calvin is on your
side / and against us. And as for Peter Martyr / and Bucer / and Musculus / and
Bullinger / Gualter / and Hemingius / and the rest of the late writers / by
citing of whom you would give to understand / that they are against us in these
matters / there is set down in the latter end of this book / their several
judgments / of the most of these things which are in controversy: whereby it
may appear / that if they have spoken one word against us / they have spoken
two for us. And whereas they have written (as it is said and alleged in their
private letters to their friends) against some of these causes / it may
appear / that they have in their works published to the whole world / that
they confirm the same causes. So y^ if they wrote any such things / they shall
be found not so much to have dissented from us / as from them selves: and
therefore we appeal from them selves / unto them selves: and from their
private notes and letters / to their public wrytings / as more autenticall.
You labor still in the fire / that is unprofitably / to bring M. Bucer his
Epistle / to prove / that the church may order things / whereof there is no
particular and expressed commandment / for there is none denies it / neither
is this saying / that all things are to be done in the church / according to
the rule of the word of God / any thing repugnant unto this / that the church
may ordain certain things / according to the word of God.

But if this epistle and others of M. Bucers with his notes upon ye book of
Common prayer / which are so often cited / and certain Epistles of M. Peter
Martyr were never printed (as I can not understand they were) then besides that
you do us injury / which go about to prejudice our cause by the testimonies of
them / which we can neither hear / nor see / being kept close in your study:
you also do your cause much more injury / whilst you betray the poverty and
nakedness of it / being feign to ransake and rifie up every dark corner / to
find some thing to cover it with. Therefore it were good / before you took any
benefit of them / to let the^ come forth / and speak their own testimonies
in their own language and full out. For now you give men occasion to think /
that there are some other things in their Epistles / which you would be loathe
the world should know / for fear of fall of that / which you would gladly
keep.

There is no man that faith / that it ought to be permitted to every person in
the church where he is minister / to have such order or discipline / or to use
such service / as he lists / no man seeks for it. But to have the order
which God has left in those things which the word precisely appoynteth / and
in other things to use that / which shall be according to the rules of S. Paul
before recited / agreed by the church / and constrined by the Prince.

And whereas you have ever hitherto given the ordering of these things to the
church / how come you now to ascribe it to the Bishops? you mean I am sure
the Bishops / as we call Bishops here in England / whereby you fall into the
opinion of the papists unawares / which when they have spoken many things of the
church magnifically / at the last they bring it now to the Doctors of the
church / now to bishops.

As form / although I doubt not but there be many good men of the Bishops /
and very learned also / and therefore very meet to be admitted into that
consultation / wherein it shall be considered / what things are good in the
church: yet in respect of that office and calling of a bishop / which they now
exercise / I think that every godly learned minister and pastor of the church
/ has more interest and right in respect of his office / to be at that
consultation / then any bishop or archbishop in the realm / for as much as he
has an ordinary calling of God and function appointed in the scriptures which
he exercises / and the other has not.

But how this authority pertaining to the whole church of making of such
orders / may and ought to be called to a certain number / that confusion may
be avoided / and with the consent also of the churches to avoid tyranny / it
shall appear in a more proper place / where we shall have occasion to speak
of the eldership or government in every church / and of the communion and
society or participation and entercommuning of the churches together / by
councels and assemblies provincial or national.

Answer till the Admonition / from the beginning of the 30. page.
Unto the places of Deuteronomic / which prove that nothing ought to be done
in the church / but that which God commands / and that nothing should be
added nor diminished. First you answer / that that was a precept given to the
Jews for that time / which had all things even the least prescribed unto them.
I see it is true which is said / that one absurdity granted / a hundred
follow. For to make good / that things ought to be done besides the scripture
and word of God / you are driven to run into part of the error of the
Manichees / which say / that the old Testament pertains not unto us / nor
binds not us. For what is it else / then to say that these two places served
for the Jews time / and under the law? For surely / if these two places agree
not unto us in time of the gospel / I know none in all the old Testament /
which do agree / and I pray you what is here said / which S. John in the *
Apocalipse says not / where he shuts up the new Testament in this sort.
I protest unto every Apoca. 22. 18.
man which hears the prophecy of this book / that whosoever adds any thing
to it / the Lord shall add unto him the plagues which are written in it: and
whosoever takes away any thing from it / the Lord shall take away his portion
out of the book of life / and out of the things that are written in it? which
admonition if you say pertains to that book of the Apocalipse only / yet you
must remember / that the same may be as truly said of any other book of the
scripture.

Then you are driven to say / that the Jews under the law / had a more
certain direction / and consequently a readyer way / then we have in the time
of the gospel / of the which time the Prophet says / that then a man should
not Ier. 31. 34.
teach his neighbor / they shall be so taught of God: as if he should say / that
they that live under the gospel / should be all in comparison of that which
were under the law Doctors. And Esaias says / that in the days of the gospel
/ the people shall not stand in the outward courts but he will bring them
into the sanctuary Esaias. 56. 5.
that is to say / that they should be all / for their knowledge as learned as
the Levites and Priests / which only had entrance into it.

Now if the Jews had precepts of every the least action / which told them
precisely how they should walk: how is not their case in that point better
then ours / which because we have in many things but general rules / are to
seek oftentimes / what is the will of God which we should follow? But let us
examine their laws / and compare them with ours in the matters pertaining to
the church: for whereas ye question is of the government of the church it is
very impertinent / that you speak of the iudicialies / as though you had not
yet learned / to distinguishe between the Church and common wealth.

To the ordering and governing of the church / they had only the moral and
ceremonial law: we have the same moral that they had: what special direction
therefore they enjoy by the benefit of that / we have. We have no ceremonies
but two / the ceremonies or sacraments of Baptism and of the Lords supper /
and we have as certain a direction to celebrate them / as they had / to
celebrate their ceremonies / and fewer and les difficulties can rise of ours /
then of theirs: and we have more plain and expres doctrine to decide our
controversies then they had for theirs. What hour had they for their ordinary
and daily sacrifices: was it not left to the order of the church? what places
were appointed in their several dwellings to hear the word of God preached
continually / when they came not to Jerusalem? the word was commanded to be
preached / but no mention made / what manner of place they should have: where
was pulpittes commanded / or chaires? and yet they had both. Where any form
of burial in the law? and yet it is a thing pertaining to the church / that
the dead be after a comely sort buried. Where / any order or form of
marriage? and yet it is known they had. It was (which is more) in the
discretion of that church / upon occasion of dearthe / or war / plagues /
or any other common calamity / to proclaim a fast.

I will not be long / where as you say / that they had nothing but was
determined by the law: and we have many things undetermined and left to the
order of the church / I will offer for one that you shall bring / that we have
left to the order of the church / to show you that they had twenty which were
undecided of by the expres word of God. For as their ceremonies and sacraments
are multiplied above ours / so grew the number of those cases which were not
determined by any expres word / and therefore* I will conclude / that for so
much as we have the same laws to direct us in the service of God / which
they had / beside that / a noble addition of the new Testament to make things
more manifest / and to bring greater light unto the old Testament / we have
also precise direction of our religion as they had / and therefore those places
of Deuter. stand in as great force now touching the government of the church
/ as they did then.

And as for the judicial law / for as much as there are some of them made in
regard of the region where they were given / and of the people to whom they
were given / the Prince and Magistrate keeping the substance and equity of them
(as it were the marrow) may change the circumstances of them / as the times /
and places / and manners of the people shall require. But to say that any
magistrate can save the life of blasphemers / contemptuous and stubborn
Idolaters / murderers / adulterers / incestuous persons / and such like /
which God by his judicial law has commanded to be put to death / I do
utterly deny / and am ready to prove / if that pertained to this question. And
therefore although the judicial laws are permitted to the discretion of the
prince and magistrate / yet not so generally as you seem to affirm / and as I
have oftentimes said / that not only it must not be done against the word /
but according to the word and by it.

After you define what is it to take from / and put to the word of God / wherein
not to speak of your wonderful dexterity in defining / which can define two
things / and those contrary (putting to and taking fro) with one difference
(which zeno him self could never do) you leave out that which Moses especially
meant to comprehend / which is / not to do more / nor to do les / the^ he has
commanded. And as for your division / it has as evil succes here / as in
other places / for when it is a great fault in dividing / to have either too
much or too little / you fault in both / for whereas you say / they add /
which teach or decree. etc. besides that you leave out which Moses meant / you
forget also that which your self had said / which had placed adding to / not
only in teaching and decreeing / but in thinking or believing. And whereas you
make four parts of your division / ye three last are found to be all under
the first member / which is to make things of faith and ceremonies / contrary
to the word / and so your division is not only faultye / but no division at
all. The which thing I could have easily forgeuen you / and passed by as a
thing not very commendable to travail to show the pouertye of those things /
which do sufficiently of them selves (as it were) proclaim their own shame:
but that it grieved me to see a book lengthened with first / second / third /
last / as though every one of them contained some notable new matter / which
needed an Oyes before it / to stir up the attention of the reader / when
there is nothing but a many of words without matter / as it were a sort of
fair empty Apothecaries boxes / without any stuff in them. And for that you
are so hard with other men for their Logike / I will desire the reader to
pardone me / if I pursue these things more narowlyer then some peradventure
will like of / or I my self delight in. And so for any definition or division
that I ca^ perceive / it stands fast / that nothing is to be done in the
church of God / but by his commandment and word directing the same. It is
true in deed / if they be not against the word of God / and be profitable for
the church / they are to be received / as those things / which God by the
church does command / and as grounded of the word of God: but there is the
question / and therefore you taking this as a thing granted always / do
always fall into that which you charge other with of the fallation of petitio
principii.

To that in the. 34. and. 35. page.
Where in effect do they say / that the church of England is boide of
preaching and ministering of the sacraments? is it all one to say / that the
word in the church of England is not purely preached / and the sacraments
sincerely / and discipline severely administered / with this / that the church
of England is void of all these? Again / where do they reason thus / that the
word of God is not truly preached / because the ministers are not rightly
proved and elected when as they have not one word of true preaching? is it all
one to say it is not purely preached / and to say it is not truly preached? S.
Paul is glad that the gospel Phil. 1. 16. 18.
be preached / although it be not purely / but he would never have been glad /
y^ it should have been preached falsely or not truly. Again / he inueyeth not
against ye false Apostles in the church of Corinth / because they preached the
word untruly / but because they using painted words and affected eloquence /
and making a great show of learning and tounges / did not preach the Gospel
sincerely. So that you see that it is one thing not to preach truly / and an
other not to preach purely: and you see their reason is not so evil: for the
want of a good calling / may give occasion to say / that the word of God is not
sincerely taught / because there is not a lawful and ordynary calling. For
although for the substance of doctrine / and the manner of handling of it /
they that S. Paul speaks of to the Phillip. did no fault / yet S. Paul says
that they did not preach purely / because they did it of contention or of eniue
/ which was no fault in the doctrine / but in him that taught. Therefore let
men judge how just your waights are / that expound not purely / not truly:
and whether this be to confute other men's arguments / rather then to skirmishe
with your own shadows.

I know no papists reason thus / that because we have no ministers / therefore
no word / no sacraments / no disciplyne / no church. For they deny we have the
word or sacraments / because we hold not their word and sacrifice / but if
there be that so reason / yet these men that you charge / have neither any such
antecedent or such a consequent: for they never said that there is no
ministry in England / nor yet do ever conclude / that there is no word / no
sacraments / no dysciplyne / nor church. For in saying that the face of the
church does not so much appear (for so the whole process of their book does
declare that they mean / when they say that we have not scarce the face of the
church) they grant / that we have the church of God: but that for want of
those ornaments / which it should have / and through certain the deformed
rags of popery which it should not have / the church does not appear in
her native colors / and so beautiful / as it is meet she should be prepared
to so glorious a husband as is the son of God. Say you certainly? and do you
believe / that the authors of this book are conspired with the papystes to
overthrow this church and realm? Now certainly I will never do that injury
unto them / as once to go about to purge them of so manifest slanders / nor
never be brought by the outrage of your speeches / to prove that noone day is
not mydnight. And therefore as for you / I will set your conscience and you
together: The reader I will desire not to think it a strange thing: For it is
no other / then has happened to the servant of God even from those which
have professed the same relygion / which they did / as it appears in Jeremy /
which 37. Cha. 12. 13
was accused of certain of the Israelites / that he had conspyred with the
Babylonyans their mortal enemies / and laid to his charge / that he was
going to them when he was going to Benjamin.

To the. 36. 37. 38. page.
IT makes for the purpose which is alleged out of the first of the acts /
to prove / that there ought to be trial of those which are chosen to the
ministry: for when S. Peter says / that such a one must be chosen as has
been contynually conversant with our savior Christ / and from the beginning
of his preaching until the day wherein he ascended into heaven / he meant
nothing else / but that such a one should be chosen which was sufficiently
instructed and had been contynually a scholar of our savior Christ / and
therefore fit to teach and to witness that / which they had seen / and whose
godly conversation was notoriously known.

Besides that / albeit those two Mathyas and Barsabas were therefore set up in
the myddest / that the church in the prayer that was made for their election /
might / by seeing them / pray the earnestlyer for them: yet it was also as
much to say / that if any could object any thing against them / that he should
prefer his objection.

And whether they were examined or no / the matter is not great / neither when
it is said that a trial should be had / it is meant / that when the parties
are famously known to those which have the right of trying / as / that there
should be always necessaryly an apposing and examyning / so that the
sufficiency of doctrine and holiness of life (for the which cause the trial
and examynation is commanded) be known and agreed upon by them / that choose
/ it is enough.

And so these two being notoriously known and consented of by the church to
be fit men / might happily not be examyned / but yet the words of S. Peter
declare plainly / that in the choice of them / there was regard had to both /
their ability to teach / and honesty of conversation.

And although there be certain things extraordinary in this election / as /
that such a one must be chosen which had been conversant with our fauioure
Christ / and that there were two put up for one place / and that it was
permitted to lottes / to cast the Apostleship upon one of them two / as if the
Lord should by the lottes from heaven / tell / who should have it: yet it
follows not to say / that the rest of the things that are there used / should
not be practiced in ordinary callinges / for as much as they will well agree
with them.

And M. Calvin in the place you allege / says / that the ordinary callinges
somewhat differ from the calling of the Apostles / and after shows wherein:
that is / in that they were appointed immediately of God / and by his mouth:
whereby it appears / that for the residue of those things which are there
mentioned / he holds that they may well stand with the ordinarye elections.

And where you say that the sixth of the Acts / because it speaks of Deacons
/ is nothing to the matter / me think you should have easily understood
that if a trial be necessary in Deacons (which is an under office in the
church / and has regard but to one part of the church / which is the pore /
and is occupied in the distribution of money) much more it ought to be in an
office of greater charge / which has / respect to the whole church / and is
occupied in the dispensing of the holy word of God.

But in the end you agree that they / should be tried / so that now the
quection stands only / how and by what means: wherein you for your part
say / that the book of ordering mynisters / is a suffycient and good rule. I
have red it / and yet I can not commend it greatly. But you will say / not
with judgment or indifferency. I will promise you with this indifferency /
that I wyshed / that all that is there / were good and conuenyent / and such as
I might say unto / so be it. With what judgment I do disalow it / I leave it
to all men to esteem upon these reasons.

First / that the examynation of his doctrine / wholely / and partly of his
life / is permitted to one man. For consydering of the one part the greatness
of the charge that is committed unto the mynisters / and the horrible pearill
that comes unto the church by the want of those things that are required in
them and of the other part wrighing the weakness of the nature of man /
which although he sees many things yet he is blind also in many / and that
even in those things which he sees / he suffers him self to be carried away
by his affection of love or of envy. etc. I say / considering these things it
is very dangerous / to commit that to the view and search of one man / which
may with loss danger and more safety be referred unto diverse. For herein the
proverb is true / plus vident oculi quam oculus. Many eyes see more / then one.


And almost there is no office of charge in this realm which lies in election
/ committed so slightly to any / as that upon one man's report of his
ability / all the rest which have interest in the election / will give their
voices / so that if we were destitute of authority of the scripture / the very
light of reason would show us a more safe and weryer way.

But there is greater authority / for S. Luke in the first of the Acces /
shows that S. Peter would not take upon him / to present two as sit for the
place which was void / but says / they did present or set up: whereby
appears / that the examynation of their ability was committed to many. The
same appears also in the sixte of the Acts / when as the Apostles will the
church wherein there were so excellent personages / to look out seven full of
the holy ghost and wisdom. etc. they do not there permit the dyscerning of
their wisdom and other gifts to one / but to many.

Secondarely / I cannot commend it / for that / that one man is the Archdeacon
/ which must examyne the pastors / and judge of their sufficiency. For what is
the Archdeacon? is he not a Deacon? for he being the chief Deacon / must
needs be also a Deacon him self. And therefore although the chief deacon /
yet inferioure to any of the pastoures: and the * gifts which are required in
him / inferioure 1. Tim. 3.
to those which are required in the pastoure. And to make him judge of the
aptness and ableness of the pastoure / is to make the inferioure in gifts /
judge of the superioure: he that has by his calling less gifts / judge of
his which has by his calling greater gifts / which is nothing else / then to
appoint him that has but one eye / to ouersee his sight / that has two.

Thirdly / I mistyke the book / because it permits that the Bishop may
admit the minister / upon the credit and report of the Archdeacon / and upon
his examination / if there be no oppositio^ of the people: which appears by
these words in the book / whereas to the Archdeacon saying thus. Reverend
father in God. I present unto you these persons to be made priests. etc. The
Bishop answers. Take heed that the persons whom you present unto us / be
apt and meet for their godly conversation / to exercise their ministry duly
/ to the honor of God and edifying of his church. And thereupon I think it
comes / that the Archdeacon is called the eye of the Bishop. But why does not
he himself take heed unto it? with what conscience can he admit a Minister /
of whose fitness he knows not / but upon the credit of an other / although
he were otherwise very fit? where can he have that full persuasion that he
does well / upon the report of others / when the report of his life / and
learning / is made but of one. And therefore * S. Paul ordained / that the same
should be the ordeyners and the examyners / 1. Tim. 3.
and not to hang upon the faith or report of an other man / in things that are
so weighty / and whereof he may him self take notice.

Fourthly / for that albeit the church is demanded whether it have any thing
to object / yet that church whereof he is to be pastor / and which it skilleth
especially that he be fit / is not demanded / and which would (because it
stands them upon) inquire dyligently of him.

Again / they are demanded / which can object nothing of his insufficiency /
when for the most part they never see nor heard of before / as one that came of
one day unto the town / and goes away the next.

Further / they have no reasonable space given them / wherein they may inquire
or hearken out of his honest conversation: and have some experyence of his
soundness in teaching and discretion and judgment to rule his flock. But if
as soon as ever it be said / to those that are strangers that they should
object against them / no man stand forth to object any thing / forthwith he is
made a mynister. And these are those things wherein I think the book of
ordering Mynisters faulty / touching the trial and examynation of the
mynisters / which self same things are likewise of the trial of the Deacon.
And so you see / that besides the faults of those that execute the law / that
there be faults in the laws themselves / and therefore the cause is truly
assygned / although you see it not.

And what mean you / still to use this fyghting with your own shadow? for
where are the words / or what be they that condemn all the Ministers / for
some? that say all the Ministers are unlawfully admitted / for some? or that
there is none good / because some are badde? If there be no such words / as
carry with them any such sense / then you do wrong to your brethren. If there
be words that declare the clean contrary / then all men see what you be /
which although you often fault in / yet I am loathe so often to name and
charge you with it. When it is said / that learned and unlearned are received /
it is euydent that they condemn not all.

The Lord bless and increase an hundredth fold the godly / wise / learned /
grave ministers of this church. And because these words seem to rock us a
sleep / and to bring us into forgetfulness of the great ruins and
desolations of the Church / I must tell you that two thousand able and
suffycient mynisters / which preach and feed dyligently / and carefully the
flock of Christ / were hard to be found in this Church / which have been
notwithstanding found in the Church of France / by the estimation of those
which know the estate / even under the time of the cross / where there were no
such helps of Magistrates / and appointed stypendes / as God be praised we
have.

And again / you are to be put in mind / that a great number of those were
bredde in king Edwardes days / so that I fear me a man need no great
Arithmatike to count the numbers of such able ministers / as the late years
have brought forth. And yet I am well assured / that if the ministry were
reformed / and worthy men were sought for / there are great nombers of zealous
and learned men / that would lay their hands to serve this kind of building
by the ministry. For besides numbers that the Universities would yield /
which sigh for the repayring of the decays of the church / to help forward
so great a work / the Innes of Court / and other the gentry of the realm /
Galene / and Justinian / would bring their tenthes / and (as it were) pay their
shot in this reckening. It is not denied / but the testimony that a noble man
which professes the truth does give / ought to be weighed according to his
degree and place which he has in the common wealth / but where you think /
that the testimony of one wise man / learned / and godly / is sufficient
warrant to proceed to an election of a Minister / you considered not well the
circumspection which S. Paul used / who when he admytted Tymothe into his
company / to be a companyon in his journey / to cut of all occasion of evil
speech / received him not * but upon commendation of the brethren / both in
Lystra and I conyum. You know they meant by the basest of 16. Act. 2. 3.
the people / such as gave but one leap out of the shop into the Church / as
suddenly are changed out of a serving man's coat / into a mynisters cloak /
making for the most part / the ministry their last refuge. etc. And seeing
that besides / the words be plain / ye daily experience teaches it / you
need not make it so strange / as though you knew not what they meant.

To the next section beginning in the. 38. page.
WHat ought to be general / if this ought not / to put the minister that has
been an idolater / from his mynisterie? is it not a commandment of God / and
given / not of one Leuite or two / but of all those that went back / not at
one time / but at others also / when the like occasion was given / as appears
in the book of Kings / where all the priests of the Lord that had sacrificed
in the 2. Chap. 23. 9.
high places / were not suffered to come to the altar in Jerusalem? Does not
S. Paul make smaller causes of deposing from the mynistery then idolatry? for
after 1. Timo. 3.
he has described what manner of men the ministers should be / and deacons /
he adds: And being tried / let them execute their functions / as long as they
remain blameless. I think if so be a man had been known to be an adulterer
/ although he repented him / yet none that is well advised / would take him
into the ministry. For if S. Paul reject him that had ij. wives at once
(which was a thing that the Jews and Gentiles thought lawful / and that was
common amongst them / and had prevailed throughout all the world) how much les
would he suffer any to be admitted to the ministry / which should be an
adulterer / and have an other man's wife / which is condemned of all that
profess the name of Christ / and which is not so general a mischief as that
was: Or would he suffer him to abide in the ministry / which should commit
such wickedness during his function / likewise of a murderer. Now the sin of
Idolatry is greater and more detestable / then any of them / in as much as
pertaining to the first table / it immediately stayneth Gods honor / and
breaks duty to him / unto whom we more owe it (without all comparison) then
to any mortal man. And if S. Paul in the choice of the widow / to attend upon
the sick of the church / which was the lowest office in the church / requires
not only such a one as is at the time of the choice / honest and holy / but
such a one as has led her whole life in all good works / and with
commendation / how much more is that to be observed in the minister or bishop
of the church / that he be not only at the time of his choice / but all other
times before such a one / as has lived without any notable / and open offense
of those / amongst whom he had his conversation.

If I should stand with you / whether Peter his forswearing that he knew not
Christ / were a greater fault then to go from the gospel to idolatry / and
there in / for some long space to continue / as the Levites did / I should
trouble you. For if a man / suddenly and at a push / for fear / and to save his
life / say and swear he is no christian / and the same day repent him of his
fault / although it be a great and heinous crime / yet it seems not to be so
great / as his is / which not only denies Christ in words / but does it also
in deeds / and worshippeth Antichrist / and continues in that worship / not a
day / but months / and years.

But I will answer you / that even as our savior Christ called S. Paul in the
heat of his persecution / and when he was a blasphemer unto the Apostleship /
so he having the law in his own hands / and making no laws for him self /
but for us / might call S. Peter also to that function / which had thrice
denied him.

But as it is not lawful for us / to follow the example of Christ in calling
of Paul / by admitting those which are new converted / having a contrary
precept given / that no * new plant / or green christian / should be taken to
the mynisterie: 1. Tim. 3. 6.
So is it not lawful / to follow that example of our savior Christ / the
contrary being commanded / as I have before alleged. For albeit the examples
of our savior Christ be to be followed of us / yet if there be commandments
general to the contrary / then we must know / that it is our parts to walk
in the broad and beaten way / as it were the common caussie of the
commandment / rather then an outpathe of the example.

I know Ambrose was taken newly from Paganism / to be bishop of Millaine / for
the great estimation and credit he had amongst the people / but besides that I
have showed / that such things are unlawful being forbidden. The errors and
corrupt expounding of scriptures / which are found in his works / declare
that it had been more safe for the church / if by study of the scriptures /
he had first been a scholar of dyuinitie / or ever he had been made
doctor. There may be more examples showed out of that / which you call the
prymitiue church / to the contrary of that which you say. For when they used
often times against those that had so fallen such severity (in deed
extreme and excessive) that they were never after / until their deaths
admitted to the Lords table: I leave to you to think / whether they would
then suffer any such to execute the function 1. Lib. Epist. epist. 7.
of the ministry. Besides that S. Cyprian has also a special treatise of
this / that those that have sacrificed to idolles / should not be permitted any
more to minister in the church. But you ask what they say to M. Luther / Bucer
/ Crannier / Latimer / Ridley? I pray you when did these excellent personages /
ever slide from the gospel unto idolatry? which of them did ever say Mass /
after God had opened them the truth? what has so blinded you that you can not
distinguishe and put a difference / between one that having been nousled from
his youth up in idolatry / comes afterward out of it / and between him /
which having knowledge of the gospel / afterward departs from it / and of
such is the place of Ezechiel / of such I say / as have gone back and fallen
away.

I know none / that have been preachers of the gospel / and after in the time
of Queen Mary malsemongers / which now are zealous / godly / and learned
preachers / and if there be any such / I think for offense sake / the Church
might better be without them then have them. You say God in that place shows
how grievous a sin idolatry is / in the priests especially. And is it not
now more grievous in the mynister of the gospel / whose function is more
precious and knowledge greater? And if the sin be greater / should it have
now a less punishment / then it had then? how shall the fault be esteemed
great or little / but by ye greatness or smalnesse of the punishment? you said
before the places of Deuteronomie / touching adding and diminishing nothing
from that which the Lord commands / were for the Jews / and are not for our
times. And this commandment of God in Ezechiel / you say / served for that
time / and not for ours.

You work a sure way / which to maintain your corruptions / deny the
scripture / which speaks against them / to be understood of those which be
in our time / and that to be understood of our ministers / which was of
theirs / or of our faults / which was of theirs. This is not the way to
Anabaptisme / but to all heresies / and schisms / that ever have been or shall
be. For if you go forward in clipping the scripture / as you begin / you will
leave us nothing in the end / wherewith we may either defend our selves
against heretics / or be able to strike at them.

Whereas you say / there is a great difference / between the severity of the
law / and lenity of the gospel / me thinks I smell a spice of the error of
the Maniches / which were also scholars in that behalf of the old heretic
Cerdon / that there is a good and an evil / a gentle and a severe God / one
under the law / and an other under the gospel. For to say that God was then a
severe punysher of sin / and that now he is not at so great hatred with it /
but that he will have it gentlyer and softlyer dealt with: is even all one in
effect with that / which supposes two Gods. I will join with you in it /
that the transgressyons of the law in the time of the gospel ought rather to
be seuerelyer punyshed / then they were under the law / for as much as the
knowledge is greater / and the abundance of the spirit of God / whereby the
laws are kept is more plentiful / then under the law.

At this time I will content me with the place of Zach. which prophesying 13.
Chap. 3.
of the kingdom of Christ / and of the time of the gospel says / that then
the father and mother of the false Prophet shall cause their own son to be
put to death. It is as absurd which is brought / to prove that the papists
which worship God falsely / do not fault so haynously as the Israelites did
/ which worshipped the Idolles. As who should say / the Jews or any other
the grossest idolaters that ever were / did ever take those things which they
worshipped / Serpents / Oxen / Fire / Water. etc. to be God / or knew not the
Images before which they fell down / were Wood or Stone / Silver and Gold.
And who knows not / that they thought that they worshipped by them and in
them / the God which made heaven and earth. The Jews when they molted a golden
Exodus 32.
calfe / and fell down before it / did never think that to be God / * but
said that they would keep holy day to the Lord Jehovah. Wherein I will put you
over to ye learned treatises of the godly new writers / which do refute this
distinction being brought of the papists / as a shift to prove that the
Idolatry which is forbidden in the old Testament / touches not them /
because they worship God by these things / and the idolatrous Jews and
infidels / worshipped nothing else / nor looked at nothing else / the^ the bare
things before which they fell down. Which self same distinction you bring to
prove / that papistrie is not so detestable / as the idolatry of the Jews. It
may be / that certain of the Gentiles worshipped by their images / Jupiter and
Juno. etc. but you can not show / that the Israelites ever worshipped any other
God / then the true God / so that their fault was only / in that they
worshipped him otherwise / then he had appointed. And the Gentiles that
worshipped many Gods / worshipped one as the head and chief / and the rest as
small companions / and as they termed them / minorum gentium deos, as the
papists do God as the chief / and the saints as other petie gods.

And here all men may see / what a good proctor you be for the papists / both
in lestning their faults / and abating their punishments / and yet will not I
say / that you are conspired with them / or have received your see of them.
But if you can show where / or in what one point / those that you charge with
confederacy / have laid so soft pillowes under their heads as these are:
they refuse not to be called confederate and conspired with the papists.

To the next section in the. 40. page.
WHat should become of the people in the mean season / whilst they learn
their Catechism / and when they have learned it / they are no more fit to be
Ministers and to teach other / then he that has learned his Accidence / is
meet to set up a schole. And it can not be defended / but it was a gross over
sight / to enjoin ministers to learn a Catechism. It were much to compel
them to read it. And if a man would have declamed against the ignorance of the
most part of the ministers / three whole days together / he could not have
said more against them / then that Canon which sends them to their A. B. C.
and principles of their religion. How know you / that they quote the Catechism
in the margent in derision? is there any syllable or letter that sounds that
ways? if you conjecture it because they have set it in the margent / you may
as well say that they likewise quote the scriptures in derision / being also
placed there.

But how follows this? it is meet that ministers should learn every day /
therefore it is meet they be enjoined to learn Cathechismes? it is meet they
should read Cathechismes / therefore meet to learn them / and be enjoined
to learn them? is there nothing worthyer the learning and profession of the
minister / then to learn Cathechismes? or does a man learn those things
always / which he reads? does he not read things some time to record the
things that he has learned. For because they say it is not meet that
ministers should be enjoined to learn a Cathechisme / you conclude of their
words / that they would not have a minister to learn / or to read any thing
/ which is as far from their meaning or words either / as you are from the
reasonable and upright expounding of them.

To the two next sections in the. 41. and. 42. page.
IT has been likewise showed / what was in that election extraordinary / and
what pertayneth to the ordinary callings. And in the.vj. of the Acts it was
showed / that if the Deacons should not be thrust upon the congregation
against the will of it / much less ought the minister. And if that
congregation had by the commandment of the Apostles an interest in the choice
of their gouernoures / I see not why the same commandment remains not to be
followed of other churches. Your reasons wherewith you would make difference /
shall be after considered.

The Answer to the next section / being the 43. page. and until (I add)
which is in the 44. page.
Unto these places of the first and sixthe of the Acts is added / first the
place of the fourtenth of the Acts / where the authors of the admonition do
prove / that the election ought not to be in one man his hand / but ought to be
made by the church / against which M. Doctor takes three exceptions. The
first is / for that it is said that Paul and Barnabas ordained Elders /
whereby he would conclude / that the congregations had nothing to do. But how
siender a reason that is / it may be considered of infinite places in the
scripture / whereof I will recite two or three.

In the fifthe Chapter of Joshua it is said / that Joshua made him sharp Chap.
5. 3.
knives for the circumcising of the children of Israel / and a little after
that Joshua circumcised them. Shall we now upon these words conclude / that
Joshua did make the knives himself / or was a cutler / or being made to his
hand / did whet them and sharpen them / or shall we say that he did circumcise
the children of Israel / in his own person and him self alone / when as that
was done by many / and by the Levites to whom that office appertayned? no /
but the scripture declares / that Joshua procured sharp knives to be made /
and exhorted and commanded the people to be circumcised.

In Exodus / it is said / that Moses did appoint unto the people / Princes /
Chap. 18. 25.
Captains over thousands and hundrethes. etc. And if any conclude thereuppon
/ that he did it him self alone / he is by and by confuted by that which is
written in Deuteronomie / where it appears / that the people did choose 1.
Chap. 13.
them / and presented them to Moises. What is it then that is said in Exodus
that Moises appointed them / but that Moses assembled the people / and
exhorted them to appoint rulers / and told them what manner of men they should
be / and in a word / sat as it were moderatour in that election?

To come to the new Testament: In the Acts it is said that Paul and 16.
Chap. 4.
Timothe delivered unto the churches the orders and decrees of the Apostles and
elders / and yet it appears in another place / that the Church had also to
do / and gave their consent unto the making of those decrees / so that the
former place means / that the Apostles and Elders did go before / and were
the chief / 15. Act. 23.
and directors of that action.

The same manner of speech is used of the Roman stories / wherein it is said
that the Consul did make Magistrates / for because that he gathered the
assembly and voices whereby they were made: and so S. Luke says here / that
Paul and Barnabas ordained / because they being the moderators of the Election
/ caused it to be made / assembled the churches / told them of the necessity
of having good pastors and governors / gathered the voices / took heed that
nothing should be done lightly / nothing tumultuously / or out of order. And so
to conclude / it is an evil reason to say as M. Doctor does / that because S.
Luke has / that Paul and Barnabas ordained / therefore the people were
excluded.

And I marvel with what conscience he could answer so in this place /
especially where it is forthwith added / that they ordained them by the
suffrages and voices of the church. But you say that the Greek word
cheirotonein, is by the common opinion of almost all Ecclesiastical writers /
used in the scripture for the solemn manner of ordaining of ministers by the
imposition of hands / which is the second exception you take to this reason.
Wherein / but that I have promised to hold my self to the matter / and that
these bold asseuerances in matters most untrue / are so common / that if I
should every foot pursue them / I should weary my self and all others / I
could not keep my self from running out to marvel at such high speeches /
void of truth. First / where you say that some translation has / that they
ordained ministers without making mention of election / what have you gained
thereby / when I can show mo that translate it otherwise / and say it is that
they ordained by election / or voices / or suffrages? I had not the commoditye
of books / whereby I could see the judgment of all Ecclesiastical writers.
But of those which I had / I find that there was but one only M. Gualter of
that mind / and yet he does not shut out the peoples consent in the election.
Master Calvin / M. Beza / M. Bullinger / M. Musculus / M. Brentius / he that
translated Chrysostom upon that place / Erasmus in his Paraphrases upon that
place / are of the contrary judgment / of whose judgment I would not have
spoken / if you would not have gone about thus to abuse your reader / with
such manifest untruths / to overthrow the order which God has established.

But let all authorities of men go / and let us examine the thing in it self.
If so be that the holy ghust had meant the solemn putting on of the hands upon
the heads of him that was created elder and minister / had he not words enough
to utter this his meaning? would he have / for laying on of hands / used a word
that signifies lifting up of hands? would he have used a word signifying
holding up for laying down? for when the hands are laid of the head of an
other / they are laid down / and not holden up. There are words in the old
Testament / and in the new / before S. Luke wrote / and after he wrote / to
expres this ceremony of laying on of hands / and yet none have ever expressed
this.

S. Paul speaks thrice of it in his Epistles to Timothe / and always he 1.
Tim. 4. 14. 1. Tim. 5. 22. 2. Tim. 1. 6.
uses epithesis ton cheiron. In the old Testament where this ceremony is used
and spoken of / the Septuaginta did never translate cheirotonein. But as the
writers of the new Testament epithesis cheiron. And what should I stand in
this / when as S. Luke him self / both before and after / speaking of that
ceremony 8. Acts. 17. 9. Acts. 17. 19. Acts. 6.
of laying on of hands / does never use this word cheirotonein, but the same
word which s. Paul uses / and the Septuaginta? and although the holy ghost
speak properly and well by whomsoever he speaks / yet it could have been worst
of all said by S. Luke of all the Canonical writers / that he should speak
thus improperly / who of them all writes most purely and elegantly /
according to the phrase of the most eloquent Grecians / and therefore he
borrowed this speech of the ancient Greek writers / which did use to expres
their elections by this word / because they were made / and voices given / by
this Ceremony of lifting up of hands.

But what if S. Luke have used this word before / and in this book / in the
signification of choosing by voice / dare you then say that he uses it here
for putting on of hands? In the Acts / S. Peter says that Christ after his
resurrection / 10. Chap. 41.
appeared not unto the whole people / but unto those whom he had before chosen
by his voice to be his witnesses / he uses this word procecheirotonemenous.
Now if you will say here / that it is to be turned / those of whom he laid
his hands / I will ask you where you read that ever he laid his hands of
their heads / I will show you where he did by his heavenly voice appoint the^.
Math. 28. 19.
And I think you are not able to show in any Greek author ancient / and
which men do take to be autenticall / to teach the property or eloquence of
the Greek tongue / I mean which were before S. Luke his time / where the
word cheirotonein, is taken for the laying on of hands of the head of any.

This I confess that the Greek Ecclesiastical writers / have sometimes used
it so / but you must remember that S. Luke could not learn to speak of them
that came two or three hundredth years after him / but he borrowed this phrase
of speech of those that were before him / and therefore speaks of elections
as they did. So that you see this shift will not serve.

Let us therefore see your third: which is / that although the Churches consent
was then required / yet is it not now / and that it is no general rule / no
more then (say you) that all things should be therefore common now / because
they were in the Apostles time.

The authors of the Admonition / with their favorers / must be counted
Anabaptists / no one word being showed which tends thereunto / you must accuse
them which confirm that foundation whereof they build their community of all
things / which is one of their chief heresies. If I should say now that you
are like to those that row in a boat / which although they look backwards /
yet they thrust a another way / I should speak with more likelihode the^ you
have done. For although you make a countenance / and speak hotely against
Anabaptists / yet in deed you strengthen their hands with reasons. But I
will not say so / neither do I think that you favor that sect / but only
the whirlewinde and tempest of your affection bent to maintain this estate /
whereby you have so great honor and wealth / drives you upon these rocks to
wrack your self on / and others.

For I pray you what community is spoken of either in the second / third / or
fourth of the Acts / which ought not to be in the church / as long as ye world
stands? was there any community but as touching the use / and so far for
the as the pore brethren had need of / and not to take every man a like? was
it not in any man his power to sell his houses or lands / or not to sell them?
When he 1. Acts. 45. 5. Acres. 4.
had sold them / was it not in every man his liberty / to keep the money to
himself at his pleasure? and all they that were of the Church / did not sell
their possessions / but those whose hearts the Lord touched singularly with
the compassion of the need of others / and whom God had blessed with
abundance / that they had to serve them selves / and help others / and
therefore it is reckened as a 4. Acts. 36.
rare example / that * Barnabas the Cyprian and Leuite did sell his possessions
/ and brought the price to the feet of the Apostles.

And as for Ananias and Saphira / they were not punished for because they
brought not the price of their possessions to the Apostles / but because they
lied / saying that they had brought the whole / when they had brought but
part. And to be short / is there any more done there / then S. Paul
prescribes to the Corinthians / and in them to all churches to the worlds
end? After he had exhorted to liberality toward the pore church in
Jerusalem / not (says he) that other 2. Cor. 8. 13. 14
should be relieved and you oppressed / but upon like condition at this time /
your abundance supplieth their lack / that also their abundance may be for
your lack / that there might be equality / as it is written / he that
gathered much / had nothing over / and he that gathered little / had not the
les.

Surely / it were better you were no Doctor in the Church / then that the
Anabaptists should have such hold to bring in their community as you give
them. In sum / the Apostolic community / or the Churches in their time was
not Anabaptisticall.

Unto the place of the second Epistle to the Corinthians / and. 8. chapter /
you ask what makes that to the election of the ministers / but why do not
you say here / as you did in the other place that the apostle means nothing
else but the putting on of the hands of them which ordained / for the same
word cheirotonetheis is here used / that was there / and this place does
manifestly and without all contradiction convince your vain signification that
you make of it in the other place / and the untruth / saying that the
scripture uses this word for a solemn manner of ordering ministers by
putting on of hands. For here it is said that he that was joined with Paul
/ was cheirotonetheis by the church / and it is manifest that the imposition of
hands was not by the church and people / but by the elders and ministers / as
it appears in s. Paul to Timothe. 1. Tim. 4. 14. 2. Tim. 1. 6.


Now / to come to that which you make so light of / for say you how follows
this / the church chose Luke or Barnabas to be companion of Paul his journey:
Ergo, the churches must choose their ministers? It follows very well / for if
it were thought^ meet / that Saint Paul should not choose him self of his
own authority a companion to help him being an Apostle / is there any
archbyshoppe that shall dare take upon him to make a minister of the gospel /
being so many degrees (both in authority / and in all gifts needful to
discern and try out / or take knowledge of a sufficient minister of the
gospel) inferioure to S. Paul?

And if S. Paul would have the authority of the church to ordain the
Minister that should aid him in other places for the gathering of relief of
the poor Churches / how much more did he think it meet / that the
Churches should choose their own Minister / which should govern them. Which
things may be also said of the election in the first of the Acts: for there
the Church first chose two / whereof one should be an Apostle / which
should not be Minister of that Church / but should be sent into all the world.
So that always the Apostles have shunned to do any thing of their own wills
/ without the knowledge either of those churches where they instituted any
governors: or if it were for the behofe of those places where there were no
churches gathered / yet would they ordain none / but by the consent of some
other church / which was already established. You will not deny / but that in
the Apostles time / and S. Cyprians time in many places the consent of the
people was required / show any one place where it was not?

Does not S. Luke say / that it was done church by church / that is in every
church? And where you say it endured but to S. Cyprians time / it shall
appear to all men / that it endured in the church a thousand year and more
after his time. And it appears in yt he used it not as a thing indifferent /
but necessary / Cipr. 1. Lib. Epi. 4. ep.
and argues the necessitye of it / of the place of the first of the Acts /
which is alleged by the authors of the Admonition / and so they are not their
arguments that you throw up so scornefully: saying / how follows this / and
this / what proves it / but Cyprians / whom by their sides you thrust
through / and so irreverently handle. But you say these examples are no
general rules. Examples of all the Apostles / in all churches / and in all
purer times / vncontrolied and vnretracted / either by any the primitive and
purer churches / or by any rule of the scripture / I think ought to stand. If
it were a private example of one / or in one place alone / or if it were
countermaunded by any other rule of the scripture / then the example were not
always safe to follow. But what if there be commandment also?

In the book of Numbers / the Lord commands that the Levites 8. Chap. 10.
which preached the word of God to the people in their several congregations
should be brought before the Lord and before the people / and the people
should lay their hands upon the Levites heads: which / what other thing is
it / then to declare their lyking of them / and by that ceremony to consecrate
them / and set them aparte for that use of their ministry? And if you say
that it were a disorder that all should lay on their hands / I grant you:
but so he speaks / because the approbatio^ was by all / and some in the name
of the rest declared that / by their laying on of hands.

But me thinks I hear your old answer / that this pertains not unto us /
being a thing done under the law: but take heed what you say / for if you will
admit neither the general examples of the new Testament / nor the
commandments and examples of the Old / take heed that you do not or ever
you be aware / spoil us of the chief and principal pillars and buttresses of
our religion / and bring us to plain Catabaptistrie / which you say you are so
afraid of.

For to prove the Baptism of children and young infantes / what stronger hold
have we / then that God commanded in the old Testament / ye they should be
circumcised / and examples thereof in the new Testament / for that the
Apostles baptized whole families / whereby all likelyhode there were children.
Now / we say that there is this commandment in the old Testament / of the
ministers / and there are examples in the new Testament general and through
out / why should it not then be necessary in this / as well as in the other?
Besides that / in the. 6. of the Acts / the Apostles command that the church
should seek them out Deacons / whom they might appoint over the poor.

Touching certain Ceremonies / I have showed that they are necessary: as
namely the Sacraments.

And as for Discipline and government / I have showed partly / and more
hereafter will be showed / that they are of the substance of the gospel / if
to have Excommunication / be to have Discipline / or if to have pastors or
Bishops / and Doctors / and Deacons / be government of the Church. You say /
that howsoever in the Apostles time this use was of having the consent of the
church in the choice of their pastor or bishop / now in this estate it were
most pernicious and hurtful. Wherein / see how unadvisedly you condemn the
churches of Geneua / of all France / of certain of the German churches /
which keep this order. But you allege your reasons / therefore those those
are to be considered / because they come so rare. For your manner is / that if
you can have but one writer / new / or old of your side / or which seems to
be of your side? you run away with the matter / as though you had scripture /
reason / doctors / and all.

I will therefore then take a view of your reasons / when as I shall have
breefely set down those reasons / whereby the perpetual equity /
reasonablenes / and conueniencie of this order / that the church should have a
stroke in her ministers election may appear.

It is said amongst the Lawyers / and in deed reason / which is the law of all
nations / confirms it. Quod omnium interest, ab omnibus approbari debet. That
which stands all men upon / should be approved of all men. Which law has
this sense / that if it may be / it were good that those things which shall
bind all men / and which require the obedience of all / should be concluded
as far as may be / by the consent of all / or at least by the consent of as
many as may be gotten. And therefore it draws much the obedience of the
subjects of this realm / that the statutes whereby the realm is governed /
pass by the consent of the most part of it / whilst they be made by them /
whom the rest put in trust / and choose for that purpose / being as it were all
their acts.

So is it also when the question is to choose the magistrate / Mayor / or
bailiffe / or Constable of every town / which things if they have good
grounds in civil affairs / they have much better in Ecclesiastical. For it
is much more unreasonable that there should be thrust upon me / a gouernoure of
whom the everlasting salvation or damnation both of my body and soul does
depend / then him of whom my wealth and commoditye of this life does hang.
Onles those upon whom he were thrust / were fools / or mad men / or
children / without all discretion of ordering them selves / which as I will
show / can not agree with those / that are the church of god / and are to have
a pastor. For they of the church of God / although they be called sheep in
respect of their simplicitye and harmelesnes / yet are they also for their
circumspection wise as serpents / in the wisdom especially which is to
salvation: and how vile account so ever you will make of of them / they are the
people of God / and therefore spiritual / and forthwith those of whom S. Paul
says / the spiritual man discerns all things. 1. Cor. 2. 15.


Moreover / reason and experience teaches / that it makes much to the
profiting of the church under the hand of the pastor or bishop / that the
church love him and reverence him: For the contempt and hatred of the minister
for the most part / stands not in his own person / but reaches even unto
the doctrine which he teaches. But the minister that the church desires / it
commonly best loves and most reuerenceth / and of the other side hates and
contemns him / that is thrust upon them / therefore it makes much to the
profiting of the people in the doctrine of the gospel / that the minister come
in / by their consent. Likewise / the people must by S. Paul his rule / follow
the good example of the minister: 1. Tim. 4. 12.
but men will not likely follow their examples / whom they love not / nor love
them / which are thrust upon them against their wills / therefore it stands
with the good conversation and godly following of the steps of the minister /
that he be with the consent of the Church.

And if it should happen (which may come to pass) that any church should
desire or choose / or consent upon by the most part / some that is unmeet /
either for doctrine or manners / then the ministers and elders of the other
churches round about / should advertise first / and afterward as occasion
should serve / sharply and severely charge / that they forbear such election
/ or if it be made / that they confirm it not / by suffering him to exercise
any ministry. And if either the churches round about do fail of this duty /
or the church which is admonished / rest not in their Admonition / then to
bring it to the next Synod / and if it rest not therein / then the Prince or
Magistrate / which must see that nothing in the churches be disorderly and
wickedly done / ought to drive that church from that election to an other which
is convenient. Now I will examine the reasons which you add to prove / that
although in times past the church chused their ministers / yet now it must be
otherwise.

To the first difference in the. 44. page.
YOu say it was in the Apostles times under the cross / and therefore few / and
so might easily know one an other / who were fit for the ministry: But you
forget your self maruellously. For in the Apostles times / the church I mean
visible and sensible (for else how could it be persecuted) was sown not only
through out all Asia (which is the greatest part of the world) but through a
great part of Africa / and no small portion of Europe: and now it is shut in
a small corner of Europe / being altogether banished out of Asia and Africa.
And therefore there are not the tithe now / of those that professed the gospel
then / and what a conclusion is this / the churches were few in number /
because they were under the cross. For to let pass both other scriptures and
stories ecclesiastical / have you forgotten that which is said in Exodus / that
the more the children of Chap. 1. 12.
Israel were pressed and persecuted / the more they multiplied? The^ you say
they kept together / and met often / and so knowing one another / were best
able to judge one of an other. But herein you speak as one that has small
experience of persecuted churches / for in the time of persecution / the
christians that were in one great city / were feign to gather them selves out
of all the corners / and from all the ends of the City / to one place / being
not able to divide them selves into many parishes / both for other
considerations / and because they were not able to maintain many ministers /
and elders / and Deacons / whereby it may be understand / that by all
likelyhode in one great city / they had but one congregation / and therefore
that must needs be scattered here and there / and so could not have the
commoditye either of often meeting / or of knowing one an other so well / as
where such a city is divided into many churches. Those that know the estate
of France in the time of persecution / do well understand that every church
almost was gathered of towns / whereof some were six miles / some seven /
some more / from the place of meeting / and keeping their congregations. And
therefore could not meet so often / nor know one an other so well / as we /
by the grace of God may do / which meet oftener / and in les number then they
do.

To the second difference.
To your second difference I answer / that in deed there be hipocrites in
our churches now / and so were there then / but more now / than then: I grant
you that also / but there is no great danger in them / as touching the
election of the minister or bishop / for that in such open and public actions
that come into the eyes of all men / there is no good man will do so holily /
as they will do / although it be fainedly. The hurt that they do / is in
closer and secreater matters. But where you say our churches are full of
drunkardes and whoremongers: besides that / you utter or ever you be aware /
how evil succes the preaching of the gospel has had here (for want of
discipline and good ecclesiastical government) you bewray a great ignorance.
For although there be hipocrites / which bear the face of godly men in the
church / whose wickedness is only known to God / and therefore can not be
discovered by men / yet in the churches of Christ there be no drunkardes nor
whoremongers / at least which are known. For either upon admonition of the
church they repent / and so are neither drunkardes nor whoremongers / or else
they are cut of by excommunication (if they continue stubborn in their
sins) and so are none of the church / and therefore have nothing to do in
the election of the minister of the church. And me thincketh you should not have been ignorant of this / that although there be * tares in the flower of Math.
13. 25.
the church / which are like the wheat / and therefore being ground / easily
mete together in ye lofe / yet there are no acornes which are bread for swine.
And although there be * goats amongst the flock of the church / because they
have some likelyhode Math. 25. 32.
with the sheep / feeding as they do / giving milk as they do / yet in the
church of Christ / there are no swine / nor hogs. It pertains to God only
/ to severe the tares from the wheat / and the goats from the sheep / but
the churches can discern between wheat and acornes / between swine and
sheep.

To the third in the. 44. page.
If they had knowledge then / it was because they were taught / and that they
are ignorant now / it is because they have no good ministers to teach them /
and if the churches should choose their ministers / I am sure they could not
choose worse / then for the most part / they have now / being thrust upon
them.

To the fourth in. 45. page.
I see that when a man is out of his way / the further he goes / the worse.
Before you placed in the church whoremongers and drunkards / as filthy swine in
the Lords courts / now you bring in Papists / and Idolaters / and Atheistes
/ which are not only filthy / but also poisoned and venoumed beasts. I am not
ignorant of that distinction / which says that there be in the church / which
are not of the church / and those are hypocrites as is before said: but I
would gladly learn of you / what scripture there is to prove / that Idolaters
and Papists / and Atheistes are in the church / when S. Paul calls all
such without 1. Cor. 5. 12.
the church / and with whom the church had nothing to do / nor they with
the church. You might as well have placed in the church / Wolves / Tigres /
Lions / and Bears / that is Tirantes and persecutors. For those ye speak of /
are (in the judgment of men and of the church) as well shut out of it / as
they in the eye of the Lord: they may in time be of the church / and so may and
are sometimes the persecutors themselves: so it appears that the election of
the church / is not / nor ought not / to be hindered by those / that have
nothing to do with it. But now I hear you ask me / what then shall become of
the Papists and Atheists / if you will not have them be of the church? I answer
that they may be of / and in the common wealth / which neither may / nor can be
of / nor in the church. And therefore the church having nothing to do with
such / the magistrate ought to see / that they join to hear the sermons in
the place where they are made / whether it be in those parishes where there is
a church / and so preaching / or where else he shall think best / and cause
them to be examined / how they profit / and if they profit not / to punish
them / and as their contempt grows / so to increase the punishment / until
such times as they declare manifest tokens of vnrepentantnes and then as
rotten members / that do not only no good / nor service in the body / but
also corrupt and infect others / cut them off: And if they do profit in hearing
/ then to be adjoined unto that church / which is next the place of their
dwelling.

To the fifte in the. 45. page.
If there be no churches established / because there are no christian
Magistrates / then the churches of the Apostles were not established. And it is
absurd to say / that the ministers now with the help of the magistrate / can
lay surer foundations of the church / or build more cunningly or substancially
/ then the Apostles could / which were the master builders of the church of
God. And as for the consummation of the body of the church / and the beauty of
it / seeing it consists in Jesus Christ / which is the head / that is
always joined unseperably in all times of the cross / and not the cross with
his body / which is the church: I can not see why the churches under
persecution / should not be established / having both the foundation and the
nether most parts / as also the top and highest part of the church / as well
as those which have a christian magistrate. If in deed the magistrate / whom
God has sanctified to be a nurse unto his church / were also the head of the
same / then the church could not be established without the magistrate / but we
learn that although the godly magistrate be the head of the common wealth /
and a great ornament unto the church / yet he is but a member of the same. The
church may be established without the magistrate / and so / that all the
world / and all the Deuilles of hell can not shake it / but it can not be in
quiet / in peace / and in outward surety / without a godly magistrate: And
therefore the church in that respect and such like / praises God and
prays for the magistrate / by the which it enjoys so singular benefits.
Therevppon you conclude / that the church was then populare / which is as
untrue / as the former part. For the church is governed with that kind of
government / which the Philosophers / that write of the best common wealths /
affirm to be the best. For in respect of Christ the head / it is a
Monarchy / and in respect of the auncientes and pastoures / that govern in
common / and with like authority amongste them selves / it is an Aristocratie
/ or the rule of the best men / and in respect that the people are not
secluded / but have their interest in church matters / it is a Democratie / or
a populare estate. An image whereof appears also in the pollicye of this
Realm / for as in respect of the Queen her majesty / it is a Monarchy / so
in respect of the most honorable Counsel / it is an Aristocratie / and
having regard to the Parliament / which is assembled of al estates / it is a
Democratie. But you should have showed / how this difference of having a
christian magistrate / and having none / ought to bring in a diversity in the
choice of the pastoure by their church. It were not hard / if one would
spend his time so unprofitably / to find out a hundred differences between
a persecuted church / and that which is in peace / but seeing you can show me
no reason / why the church may not choose her minister / as well under a godly
magistrate / as under a tyrante / I will show you / how that if it were
lawful to break the order of God / it were meeter in the time of persecution
/ that the election should be in some other discreate and learned persons
hands / to be made without the consent of the church: then in that time when
there is a godly magistrate / and that it is then most convenient that he
should be chosen by the church.

In the time of persecution a church chooses an unlearned minister / or one
that is wicked in life / howsoever it be / he is unfit / the churches round
about by their ministers or elders admonish this church of her fault / and
move to correct it / the church will by no means be admonished: what can now
the other churches do in the time of persecution? if they excommunicate the
whole church / it is a hard matter / and yet if they may do that / there is
all they can do: the evil is not remedied / which may be easily taken away /
where there is a godly magistrate / and the church (as is before said)
compelled to a better choice / so you see that there are inconveniences in the
choosing of the pastor / and other the governors of the church / by the church
/ in the time of persecution / which are not in the time of peace under a
christian magistrate.

Now I will show you (which think that the consent of the church in their
minister / can not stand with the time of a christian magistrate) that it has
not only stood / but has been confirmed in their times / and by them. In
codice Iustiani: it is thus written / following the doctrine of the holy
Apostles. etc. we ordain / that as often as it shall fall out / that the
ministers place shall be void in any city / that voices be given of the
inhabiters of that city / that he of three (which for their right faith /
holiness of life / and other good things are most approved) should be chosen to
the Byshoprike / which is the most meet of them. Also Carolus Magnus / which
was the first German Emperor in. 63. distinct. sacrorum canonum says /
being not ignorante of the holy Canons / that the holy church in the name of
God should use her honor the freelyer / we assent unto the Ecclesiastical
order / that the bishops be chosen by election of the cleargye and people /
according to the statutes of the canons of that diocese.

In the. 63. distinction it appears / that Ludouicus Carolus his son
decreed / that he should be bishop of Rome / whom all the people of Rome should
consent to choose. Platina also in the life of pope Adrian. 2. writes that
Ludouike the second by his letters commanded the Romans / that they should
choose their own bishop / not loking for other men's voices / which being
strangers / could not so well tell what was done in the common weal where
they were strangers / and that it appertained to the Citizens.

The same Platina witnesses in the life of Pope Leo the. 8. that when the
people of Rome were earnest with the Emperor Otho the first / that he would
take away one Pope John that lived very licentiously and riotously / and place
an other / the same Emperor answered / that it pertained to the cleargye and
people to choose one / and willed them that they should choose / and he would
approve it: and when they had chosen Leo / and after put him out without cause
/ and chose one Pope Benet / he compelled them to take Leo again. Whereby
appears that in those estates where Magistrates were Christian / and where
the estate was most of all Monarchical / that is subject to ones government
/ that this use of the Church remained and was confirmed by the Emperors /
and also when the church put out any without good cause / that then the
Magistrates should compel the churches to do their duetye. In deed the
bishop of Rome gave the election then into the Emperor his hands / because
of the lyghtnesse of the people / as Platina makes mention / but that is not
the matter / for I do nothing else here but show / that the elections of the
ministers by the Church / were used in the times of the Emperoures / and by
their consentes: and seeing that Otho confessed it pertayned not unto him / it
is to be doubted / whether he took it at the Bishop his hands.

And if the Emperoures permitted the election of the bishop to that City /
where it made most for their suertie to have one of their own appointment / as
was Rome / which with their bishops did often times put the good Emperoures
to trouble: it is to be thought / that in other places both Cities and towns /
they did not deny the elections of the ministers / to the people. Besides that
/ certain of those constitutions are not of Rome / but of any city
whatsoever. And these Emperoures were / and lived between 500. and odd years
/ until the very point of a thousand years after Christ / so that hither to
this lyberty was not gone out of the Church / albeit the Pope which brought in
all tyranny / and went about to take all liberty from the churches / was now
on horse back / and had placed him self in that Antichristian seat.

To the next section in the 45.
THose that write the Centuries / suspect this Canon / and doubt whether it be
a bastard or no / considering the practice of the church: But here or ever
you were aware / you have stricken at your self. For before you said / that
this order of choosing the minister by voices of the church / was but in the
Apostles time / and during the time of persecution. And the first time you can
allege this liberty to be taken away / was in the 334. year of our Lord /
which was at the least 31. years after that Constantine the great began to
reign. I say at the least / because there be good authors that say / that this
Council of Laodicea was holden Anno. 338. after the death of Iouinian the
Emperor / and so there is 35. years between the beginning of Constantines
reign / and this council. Now I think you will not say that the Church was
under persecution in Co^stantines time. And therefore you see you are greatly
deceived in your accoumpt.

And if it be as lawful for us to use master Caluins authority / which both
by example and wrytings has always defended our cause / as it is for you to
wring him and his words / to things which he never meant / and the contrary
whereof he continually practiced / then this authority of youres is dashed. For
Upon the Acts. 16.
master Calvin says / where as it is said in that council / that the election
should not be permitted to the people / it means nothing else but that they
should make no election / without having some ministers or men of judgment /
to direct them in their election / and to gather their voices / and provide
that nothing be done tumultuously / even as Paul and Barnabas were chief in
the election of the churches. And even the same order would we have kept in
elections continually for avoiding of confusion / for as we would have the
liberty of the Church preserved / which Christ has bought so dearly from all
tyranny / so do we again condemn and utterly abhor all barbarous confusion
and disorder.

But if councelles be of so great authority to decide this controversy / then
the most famous council of Nice will strike a great stroke with you / which in
an Epistle that it writes unto the Church of Egypt (as Theodoret makes
mention) speaks thus. It is meet that you should have power both to choose
any man / and to give their names which are worthy to be amongst the clergy /
and to do all things absolutely according to the law and decrees of the
church. And if it happen any to dye in the church / then those which were
last taken / are to be promoted to the honor of him that is dead / with this
condition / if they be worthy / and the people choose them / and the bishop of
the city of Alexandria together giving his consent / and appoynting them.

An other of the famousest councelles / called the council of Constantinople /
which was gathered under Theodosius ye great (as it is witnessed by the *
Tripartite 9. Lib. 14. cap.
story) in an Epistle which it wrote to Damasus the pope / and Ambrose and
others / says thus. We have ordained Nectarius the bishop of Constantinople
/ with the whole consent of the counsel / in the sight of the Emperor
Theodosius beloved of God / the whole City together decreeing the same.
Likewise he says that Flauian was appointed by that synod / bishop of
Antioche / the whole people appoynting him.

Likewise in the council of Carthage where Augustine was / holden about anno
domini 400. in the first canon of the council it is said / when he has been
examyned in all these / and found fully instructed / then let him be ordained
Bishop by the common consent of the clerks and the lay people / and the
Bishops of the province / and especially either by the authority or presence
of the metropolitan.

And in the Toletane council / as it appears in the 51. distinction / it was
thus ordained. Let not him be counted a priest of the Church (for so they
speak) whom neither the clergy nor people of that city where he is a priest
does choose / nor the consent of the metropolitan and other priests in that
province has sought after.

Moreover / concilium Cabilonense which was holden anno domini. 650. in the
tenth Canon / has this. If any Bishop after the death of his predecessor be
chosen of any but of the bishops in the same province / and of the clergy and
citizens / let an other be chosen / and if it be otherwise / let that
ordination be accounted of none effect. All which councelles prove manifestly /
that as ye people in their elections had the ministers round about / or
synodes and counceiles directing them / so there was none came to be over the
people / but by their voices or consentes.

To the next section in the 45. page: This alteration. etc.
IN deed if you put such dark coleures upon the Apostles church as this is /
it is no marvel if it ought not to be a patron to us of framing and
fashioning our church after it. But O Lord who can patiently hear this
horrible disorder / ascribed to the Apostles church / which here you attribute
unto it: that every one hand over head preached / baptized / and expounded the
Scriptures. What a window / nay / what a gate is opened here to Anabaptists
/ to confirm their fantastical opynion / wherein they hold / that every man
whom the spirit moves / may come even from the ploughe tail to the pulpit
to preach the word of God. If you say it is Ambrose saying and not youres / I
answer / unless you allow it / why bring you it / and that to prove the
difference between the Apostles times and these. For if it be false (as it is
most false) then there is no difference here between the Apostles times and
ours. Does not the whole course of the scriptures declare / and has it not
been proved / that there was none that took upon him the ministry in the
church / but by lawful calling? what is this but to cast dust and dirte of
the fairest and beautifullest image that ever was / to make a smokie /
disfigured / evil proportioned image to seem beautiful / to overthrow the
Apostles buildings of gold and silver and precious stones / to make a cottage
of wode / straw / and stubble / to have some estymation / which could have none
/ the other standing. For in effect so you do / when (to uphold a corrupt
use that came in by the tyranny of the pope) you go about to discredit the
orders and institutions which were used in the Apostles times? and that with
such manifest untruths.

To the next section in the. 45. page: Musculus also. etc.
THe place is too common which you assign / you had I am sure the book before
you / you might have told where the place was / and in what title. But that
place of Musculus in the title of the magistrate / is answered by him self in
the same book / where he entreats of the election of the ministers. For
going about (as it seems) to satisfy some of their ministers / which were
brought in doubt of their calling / because they were not chosen by their
churches / speaking of the use of the church in choosing their minister / he
says thus.

First / it must be plainly confessed / that the ministers were in times past
chosen by consent of the people / and ordained and confirmed of the semores.

Secondarily / that that form of election was Apostolical and lawful.

Thirdly / that it was conformable to the liberty of the church / and that
thrusting the pastor upon the church / not being chosen of it / does agree to a
church that is not free but subject to bondage.

Fourthly / that this form of choice by the church makes much both to that
/ that the minister may govern his flock with a good conscience / as also
that the people may yield them selves to be eastyer ruled / then when one
comes against their wills unto them.

And to conclude all these / he says that they are altogether certain / and
such as can not be denied. After he says that the corrupt estate of the
church and religion drives to alter this order / and to call the election to
certain learned men / which should after be confirmed of the Prince. And that
it may yet more clearly appear that his judgment is nothing less then to
confirm this election / he sets down their election in Bernland / which he
approves and labors to make good / as one which although it does not fully
agree with the election of the prymitine church / yet comes very near unto
it: As that not one man but all the ministers in the city of Berne / do choose
a pastor when there is any place void.

Afterward he is sent to the Senate / from the which / if he be doubted of / he
is sent again to the ministers / to be examined / and then if they find him
meet / he is confirmed of the Senate / (which stands of some number of the
people) and by the most part of their voices. By these things it appears /
that this election of the minister by the people / is lawful and Apostolic /
and confessed also by him / that those that are otherwise / bring with them
subjection unto the church / and servitude / and carry a note and mark of
corruption of religion.

Last of all / that he goes about to defend the election used in the churches
where he was minister / by this / that it approached unto the election in the
primitive Church. Now what cause there may be / that we should bring the
church into bondage / or take away that order whereby both the mynister may be
better assured of his calling / and the people may the willinglyer submit them
selves unto their pastoures and gouernoures / or what cause to depart from the
Apostolic form of the choice of the pastor being lawful / I confess I know
not / and would be glad to learn.

To assign the cause hereof unto the christian magistrate / and to say / that
these things can not be had under him (as you / under master Muscuius name /
do affirm) is to do great injury unto the office of the magistrate / which
abridgeth not the liberty of the church / but defends it / dimmisheth not
the pastor his assurance of his calling / but rather increases it / by
establishing the ordinary callings only / which in the time of persecution
sometimes are not so ordinary / withdraws not the obedience of the people
from ye pastor / but urges it / where it is not / and constrayneth it / where
it is not volu^tary. And seeing that also Musculus says / that these forced
elections are remedies for corruption of relygion / and disordered states /
what greater dishonor can there be done unto the holy institution of God in
the civil gouernoure / then to say that these forced elections without the
consent of the people must be / where there is a christian Magistrate: as
though there could be no pure religion under him / when as in deed it may be
easily under him pure / which can hardly / and with great danger / be pure
without him. And when as it is said / that the churches consent should be had
in the election of the minister / we do not deny the confirmation of the
elections unto the godly civil magistrate / and the disanulling of them / if
the church in choosing / and the ministers in directing / shall take any unfit
man / so that yet / he do not take away the liberty from the church / of
choosing a more convenient man.

So that you see / that by Musculus your witness reasons / this enforced
election without the consent of the people / is but corrupt / and so ought not
to be in the church. And that although it has been borne withal / yet it
must be spoken against / and the lawful form of election labored for / of
all those that love the truth / and the sincerity thereof.

To the next section in the. 46. page.
NOw you would prove that this election of ministers by one man was in the
Apostles time. But you have forgotten your self / which said a little before
/ that this election by the church / was not only in the Apostles times / but
also in the time of Cyprian: now you say otherwise. And if the election of the
ministry by the church agree so well with the time of persecution / and when
there is no christian Magistrate / how comes it to pass / that in those
days when persecution was so hot / and there were no such Magistrates / that
S. Paul would have the election by one man / and not by the church. Besides
that / if this be S. Paul his commandment / that the bishop should only
choose the minister / why do you make it an indifferent thing / and a thing in
the power of the church to be varyed by times / for this is a flarte
commandment. Thus you see you throw down with one hand / as fast as you
build with the other. But to answer directly to the place of the fifthe of
the first to Timothe.

I say first / that S. Paul writes to Timothe / and therefore instructs
him what he should do for his part in the appoynting of the minister. If he
had written to the whole Church of Ephesus / he would likewise have instructed
them how they should have behaved the^ selves in that business. If one do
write unto his friend / that has interest in any election / to take heed that
he choose none but such as are meet / shall any man conclude thereupon / that
none has to do in that election / but he to whom that letter is written? Then
I say further / that S. Paul attributes that unto Timothe / that was common
to more with him / because he being the director and moderator of the election /
is said to do that which many do: which thing I have proved by diverse
examples both out of the scripture / and otherwise before. And even in this
imposition of hands / it is manifestly to be showed. For that where as S.
Paul says in the 2. Epistle / 2. Tim. 1. 6.
that Timothe was ordained by the putting on of his hands upon him / in the
first Epistle he says / that he was ordained by the putting on of the hands
of 1. Tim. 4/12.
the eldership. So that that which he in one place takes to him self alone /
in the other he communicates with more. And that he did it not him self alone
/ it may appear by those words which follow (and communicate not with other
men's sins) as if he should say / if other will ordeyne insuffycient
ministers / yet be not thou carried away with their example. And further that
his authority was equal with other elders of that church / and that he had no
superiority above his fellows / it may appear / for that he says lay thy
hands rashly of none / where if he had had authority over the rest / he would
rather have said / suffer none to lay his hands rashly. Again / it is a fault
in you / that you can not distinguishe or put difference between the election
and imposition of hands.

Last of all / I answer that although this might agree to Timothe alone / as
in deed it can not / yet it follows not that every Bishop may do so. For
Timothe was an Evangelist / which was above a Bishop / as hereafter shall
better appear. And it is an evil argument to say the greater may do it /
therefore the less may do it. The superior / therefore the inferioure. If you
were at any cost with producing your witnesses / you should not be so unwise to
be so lauishe of them / as to cite Ambrose / and Chrysostom / to prove a thing
that none has ever denied. For who denies that S. Paul does not give warning
to Timothe to be circumspect? If you mean to use their testimony to prove
that he only made the elections / they say never a word for you / if there be
any thing / cite it. To the place of Titus / I answer as to that of Timothe /
for there is nothing there / but agrees also to this place. And as for Jerome
he has nothing in that place / as he has in no other / to prove that to the
Bishop only / does belong the right of election of the minister.

I have showed you reasons before / why it ca^ not be so taken of the sole
election of the Bishop / the church being shut out. If authority would do
any good in this behalf / as it seems it ought / seeing that all your proof
through out the whole book / is in the authorities of men / (which Aristotle
calls atechnas peiseis, uncunning proofs) I could send you to master
Calum / which teaches / that it is not to be thought that S. Paul would
permit to Titus to ordain bishops and ministers by his own authority /
when he him self would not take so much upon him / but joined his with the
voices of the church. But he peradventure sauoureth not your taste / and yet you
would make men believe sometimes / that you make much of him if you can get
but one word unjointed / and racked in pieces from the rest / to make good
your part. If he weyghe not with you / you have master Musculus / whom you
take to be a Musculus in his common places in his title of the election of
ministers.
great patron of youres in this cause / which does with greater vehemency
affirm the same thing that master Calvin says / asking whether any man can
believe that Paisle permitted in this place to Titus / or in the place before
alleged to Timothe / that they should ordain of their own authority / and
by them selves / when as Paul would not do it but by the voices and election
of the church.

In the end you say it is the general consent of all the learned fathers /
that it belongs to the bishop to choose the minister. Because you acquaint my
ears with such bold and untrue affirmations / I can now the more patiently
hear you thus vaunting your self / as though you had all the fathers by heart
/ and carried them about with you / wheresoever you went / whereas / if a man
would measure you by the skill in them which you have showed here / he would
hardly believe that you had read the tenthe part of them.

Are all the learned fathers of that mind? I think then you would have been
better advised then to have set down but one / when as you know a matter in
controversy / will not be tried but by two or three witnesses / unless the
Lord speak him self / and therefore you give me occasion to suspect that
because you cite but one / you know of no more: now let us see what your one
witness will depose in this matter.

And first of all you have done more wisely then simply / in that you have
altered Ieromes words. For where he says / wherein does a bishop differ
from an elder / but only in ordayning: you say a bishop does excel all other
mynisters. etc. I report me here unto your conscience / whether you did not of
purpose change Ieromes his sentence / because you would not let ye reader
understand what odds is between S. Ieromes bishops in his days / and between
our Lord Bishops. For then the bishop had nothing above an elder or other
minister / but only the ordayning of the minister. Now he has a thousand
parishes / where the minister has but one. For the matters also of the
substance of the ministry / the bishop now excommunicateth / which the
minister can not / absolueth or receives into the church / which the minister
can not. Besides diverse other things which are mere civil which the bishop
does / and which neither bishop nor other minister ought to do. I say I
report me to your conscience / whether you altered Ieromes words to this end
/ that you would keep this from the knowledge of your reader or no. For
answer to the place / it is an evil argument to say the bishop had the
ordayning of the minister. Ergo he had the election of him / the contrary
rather is a good argument / the bishop had the ordayning of the minister /
therefore he had not the election of him. For ordination and election are
diverse members of one whole / which is the placing of the pastor in his church
/ and one member can not be verified of an other / as you can not say your
foot is your hand. I will not deny / but that sometimes these words may be
found confounded in Ecclesiastical writers / but I will show you also / that
they are distinguished / and that the election pertayneth to the people / and
ordayning unto the Bishop.

Upon the sixte of the Acts the gloss has / that that which was done there of
the xij. Apostles / in willing the brethren to look out fit men / was done to
give us example / and must be observed in those that are ordained. For says
the gloss / the people must choose / and the Bishop must ordain. And that S.
Jerome must be so understood / it appears not only that it has been so
expounded: but also it may be casely proved / for that S. Ieromes sentence and
judgment appears in other places / that he would have nothing here done
with out the people / as in his Epistle / ad Rusticum monachum: he wills that
the people should have power and authority to choose their clerks and their
ministers / and in his Epistle to Neopotian / of the life of the clerks / he
has this distinction manifestly: They run / says he / unto the Bishops
suffragans certain times of the year / and bringing some sum of money / they
are anointed / and ordained / being chosen of none / and afterward / the
Bishop without any lawful election / is chosen in hugger mugger / of the
Canons or Prebendaries only / without the knowledge of the people. And so you
see / that although y^ S. Jerome says / that the Bishop had the ordayning of
the ministers / yet he had not the election / for the ordayning was nothing
else but an approving of the election / by putting on of hands / and
consequently / having made your vaunt that all the learned fathers were of this
judgment / that the Bishop should elect the minister / you show not so much as
one.

Now will I show you the clean contrary of that you say / not that I gladlye
travail this ways / for if you had not constrained me / you should not have
heard one voice this way. And would to God that you would be content /
especially when you meet with those that will be tried by the scriptures / to
seek no farther strength then they give you. But I am loathe you should
oppress the truth / and make all men afraid of it / by making them believe /
that it is so desolate and forsaken of her friends / as you pretend. You
confess S. Cyprian is against you herein / and he was a learned father / and
a Martyr also / which did not only use this form of election / but also taught
it to be necessary / and commanded / and therefore me thincketh you should
not have said all the learned fathers without exception. You see also S.
Jerome is of an other judgment. S. Augustine also / when he speaks how he
appointed Eradius to succeed him / shows / how it was the approved right
and custom / that the whole church should either choose / or consent of their
Bishop. And * Ambrose says / that that is truly and certaynely a divine
election to the office Epist. 81.
of a bishop / which is made of the whole church. Eregorius Nazianzene in the
Oration which he had at the death of his father / has diverse things which
prove that the election of the minister pertayned to the Church / and
confuteth those things which should seem to hinder it. These were learned
fathers / and yet thought not that the election of the pastor or bishop /
pertayned to one man alone but that the church had also her interest /
therefore you see all the learned fathers are not of that mind / you say they
are.

And that this election continued in the church / until within a three
hundred years / at what time there was more then Egyptiacall / and palpable
darcknesse over the face of the whole earth / it may appear in a Treatise of
Flaccus Illir^cus / which he calls an addition unto his book that he
entituleth the Catalogue of the witnesses of truth / of whom I confess my
self to have been much helped in this matter of the choice of the church
touching the ministers: especially in the Emperoures Edictes which are before
cited. For lacking opportunities diverse ways / I was contented somewhat to use
the collection to my commodity / for the more speedy furtheraunce / and
better proceeding in other matters / which I will leave of / because they may
be there red of those that be learned / whom I will also refer to the six
and seven books of Eusebius / where both the forms of the electio^s in those
times are described / and where / besides that the customs of the peoples
choice is set forth / there are examples of the election of the people and
clergy / which were confirmed by the christian Magistrate / namely in the
Bishop of Constantinople. And these may suffice for the other that have not
that commodity of books / nor ability / nor skill to read them / being in
a strange tongue / to know / that besides the institution of God in his word
/ this manner of election did continue so long / as there was any light of the
knowledge of God / in the church of God. I will add only one place / which if
it be more bitter then the rest / and cut the quick more near / you shall
not be angry with me / but first with those that were the authors of it / and
then with him that wrote it.

Eusebius speaking of Origin / which was admitted not of one Bishop / 6. Lib.
cap. 20.
but of many Bishops to teach / shows how the Bishops were reprehended
by the Bishop of Alexandria called Demetrius / because they had admitted him
without the election of the presbytery of the church / which were the chief
in the election in every church / and unto the which the churches did commit
the government of them selves in every several town and City / and says /
that it has not been heard that laikous should homilein paronton ton
episcopon: which is / that the lay men should teach when the Bishops were
present / whereby it is evident / that he counted him a lay man / which was
only admitted by the Bishops / although they were many / not being first
elected by the presbytery of that church whereof he was the teacher.

Seeing then that the scripture does teach this order / that there should be
no minister thrust upon the church / but by the consent thereof / and reason
persuades that ways / and the use of the church has been so from time to
time / both in peace and in time of persecution / both under tyrants and
godly Princes / it can not be without the high displeasure of almighty God /
the great hurt and sore oppression of the church / that one man should take
this unto him / which pertayneth to so many / or one minister / which
pertayneth to more then one / especially / where the advice of learned
ministers may concur with the peoples election or consent.

Now if any man will rise up and say / that this doctrine brings in disorder
/ and by this means children / and boys / and women should have their voices
/ which is unseemly / all men understand that where the election is most
freest and most general / yet only they have to do / which are heads of
families / and that this is but a mere cavil to bring the truth in hatred /
which is unworthy to be answered / and requires rather a Censor / then a
Disputer to suppress it.

To the. 47. and. 48. pages.
THe reason is of greater force then you would seem to make it / for as the
twelueth place was to Mathias / so is a certain church unto a pastor or
mynister / and as the Apostles ordained none unto that place / before it was
void / so ought not the Bishop ordain any / until there be a church
void and destitute of a pastor. And as the Apostles ordained not any Apostle /
further then they had testimony of the word of God / as it appears that S.
Peter Act. 1. 20.
proceeds by that rule to the election / so ought no bishop ordain any to
any function / which is not in the scripture appointed: but there are by the
word of God at this time / no ordinary ministeries ecclesiastical / which be
not local / and tied to one congregation / therefore this sending abroad of
ministers / which have no places / is unlawful.

And that it may the better appear / that those functions do only remain /
which are appointed to one certain place / and that the reader may have the
clearer and playner understanding of all this matter / all the whole
ecclesiastical function may be well divided: first into extraordinary / or
those that endured for a time / and into ordinary / which are perpetual. Of
the first sort are the Apostles and Evangelists / which the Lord used for a
time as it were for chief masons / and principal builders of his church / as
well to lay the foundations of churches where none were / as also to advance
them to such forwardness and heighte / until there might be gotten / for the
finishing of the building and house of the Church fit pastors / elders / and
deacons. And that being done / they went from those places into others / which
thing may be perceived by the continual story of the Acts of the Apostles /
and by diverse sentences which are found in the Epistles of S. Paul. And
therefore also / when the churches have been by antichrist even rased from the
foundations / God has stirred up Evangelists even immediately by this spirit
/ without any calling of men / to restore his churches again: of which sort
was Master Wickliffe in our Country / Master Hus and Jerome of Prage in
Bohemia / Luther and winglius in Germany. etc. And after this sort / God may
at his good pleasure work / when he purposes to set in his gospel in any
nation / where the whole face of the earth is covered with the darckenesse of
ignorance / and want of the knowledge of God.

Of this sort of extraordinary functions are the Prophets also / which besides
a singular dexterity and readiness of expounding the scriptures / had also the
gift of telling things to come / which because it is not now ordinarily / I
think there is none wildeny / but it is an extraordinary calling: For the
other two of the Apostles and Evangelists / it shall appear more at large
hereafter (by occasion given by master Doctor) that they are but for a tune.

The ordinary and continual functions of the church / are also divided into two
parts / for either they are they that govern or take charge of the whole
church / as are those which are called elders / or they which take charge of
one part of the Church (which is the poor of every church) as are those which
are called deacons. Those again that are presbyteri / which we term elders of
the church / and have to do with the whole church / are either those which
teach and preach the word of God / and govern so / or else which govern only
/ and do not teach nor preach. Of the first kind are pastors and doctore. Of
the second are those / which are called by the common name of elders or
ancients. Of all this ordinary function I shall have occasion to speak / and
of every one shall appear that (which I have said before) that they are no
uncertain and vndefunte ministeries / but such as are limited unto a certain
church and congregation. And first of all for the pastor or bishop which is
here mentioned: which name so ever we consider of them / they do forthwith as soon as they are once either spoken or thought of / imply and infer a certain
and definite charge / being as the Logicians term them / actual relatiues.
For what shepherd can there be / unless he have a flock? and how can he be a
watchman / unless he have some city to look unto? Or how can a man be a master
/ onles he have a servant? Or a father unless he have a child? Now if you
will say that they have a charge / and they have flocks and cities to attend
and watch upon / for a wholo shire / or province / or realm / are their
flocks / and their cities / and their charges.

First of all in your reading ministers that is untrue / for they go not to
read in all churches / but tarry until they be hired in one. And therefore when
the Bishop has laid his hand of them / they are no more ministers then before
his hund came upon them / because they have no charges / and therefore the
patron or person that hireth them to read / and sets them a work are their
bishops / and make them ministers / and not the Bishop of the diocese.

Secondarily for those that preach to have a whole diocese / or province / or
realm to be their flock / or city to attend upon / is contrary to the
policy or good husbandrye of all those / that would either have their city
safe / or their flocks sound. For who are they which would appoint one for the
watch of a thousand towns or cities / when as all they which love their
safetye / would rather have for every city many watchmen / then for many
cities one? or what is he that is so watchful and circumspect / whose
diligence and watchfulnes one city assaulted with ennemies / will not wholely
occupy and take up? or what is he whose sight is so sharp / that he can see
from one end of ye diocese / or province / or realm to the other end
thereof? or what is he that will commit the keeping of.xx. M. sheep to one man
/ that looks for any good / or increase of them? how shall all these hear
his whistle / how shall all know his voice / when they can not hear it? how
shall they acknowledge him / when they can not know him? how shall they
follow him / when they can not see him go before? how shall he heal their
diseases / when he can not possibly know them. But some man will say / that
these are human reasons / and likelyhodes which may be overthrown with
other similitudes. These notwithstanding are Analogies drawn from the nature
of those things which the ministers are likened unto / and are of the most
part used of the holy Ghost him self expressly. But that there be no
controversy left in this point / what is a flock? S. Paul defines it plainly
/ when he says: appoynte Titus. 1. 5.
pastors / or elders / or bishops (for these words are indifferently used)
through / not every shire / or province / or realm / but through every city /
or town. And least that any man should here take occasion to conclude / that
then it is lawful for one manne to be bishop or pastor of a whole City /
such as London or York. etc. S. Luke in the Acts does declare the meaning
of this place / where 14. Chap. 23.
he says / that they appointed elders throughoute every congregation / so that
if the city or town be great / and the professors of the gospel in it / be
more then will make conveniently a congregation / then there must be by the
rule of God more pastors and bishops. Whereupon it appears / that both no
pastor or bishop ought to be made without there be a flock / as it were a
void place for him / and that a flock is not a realm / or province / or
dioces (as we now call a dioces) but so many as may conveniently meet in one
assembly or congregation. And that this is the meaning of S. Paul / it
appears by the practice of the Churches from time to time / which have both
decreed against / and found fault with these wandering / and rouing ministeries.

The great council of * Calcedon decreed that no elder / or deacon / or any
Cap. 6. actio. 15
other in the ecclesiastical order should be ordained apolelymenos: that is
losely / and as it were let go at randone whether he him self lists / which
he also interpreateth by and by more plainly when he adds / that he should
not be ordained Eime idicos en ecclesia poleos e comes: that is / vnies it be
specially in a congregation of some city or town. And in the council of
Urban (as Gratian reports / distinction. 70.) it was decreed / that the
ordination that was made without any title / should be void / and what that
means / is showed by and by / when it is said / and in what church any is
entitled / there let him always remain. And this is also S. Jerome his
complainte / in that men were ordained unto the ministry / Ad Nepotianum.
when they were chosen by no church / and so went round about having no
certain place. And therefore this / that none ought to preach / onles he have
some pastoral charge / ought not to have been so strange a thing unto you as you
make it / if either the scriptures / or the councels / or the ancient fathers
had been so well known unto you / as either your name requires / or you take
upon you / which dare so boldly pronounce / that there can be showed no text of
scripture for the matter.

But you ask what place Paul and Barnabas had appointed them. What / mean you
thereby to conclude / that because Paul and Barnabas the apostles had no place
appointed them / therefore a pastor or bishop should not? when this is one
difference between the apostle and bishop / that the one has no certain place
appointed / and the other has. But I think I smell out your meaning / which is
/ that we may make apostles also at these days / and that that function is not
yet ceased / for otherwise your reason is nothing worth. Likewise also you
ask of Phillip which was an evangelist. And so you think y^ these running
ministers are lawful / because they are Apostles and Evangelists / against
which I shall have occasion to speak shortly after in the. 50. page. But if a
man be able to live of himself / and mind not to be burdensome to the church
/ it seems unreasonable unto you / that he may not go about and preach
throughout all churches.

Did you never read any learned disputations / and that of learned writers in
our days about this question: whether (although it be lawful) it be expedient
P. Martyr upon the first to the Corinth. 9. chap. thincketh it more expedient
for one to take wages of the church / although he be able to live of him self.
that a man being able and willing to live of himself / ought to take wages of
the church / for inconveniences which might ensue of taking nothing? I do but
ask you the question / because you make so great a wonder at this / for I will
not take upon me here the defense of it / because I will not multiply
questions.

And why I may you may not that man that is so able / and will be content to
live of him self / why I say may not he teach / and be the pastor of some
church? Do you think that for his forbearing the wages of the Church / he
may break the laws and orders that God has established? for the rest
contained in those pages touching the ordaining of ministers or bishops / I
have before spoken at large.

To the. 49. page.
OEcumenius and Chrysostom say that by Elders he means Bishops / not
thereby to sever those that had the government of the church together with
the pastor and minister of the word / which were called ancients / as you seem
to mean: but to put distinction between those which are elders by age / and
elders by office / besides y^ / it is before alleged y^ it may be y^ the
pastor or bishop did in the name of all the elders / lay on his hands upon him
that was ordained. And lastly / you know and can not deny that s. Paul in one
or two places confounds the Bishop and the Elder. To say that the bishop may
as well say (receive the holy ghost) as to say the words used in the supper / or
to say y^ the sins of those which to believe are forgiven / is dis dia pason,
as far as York and London. For there / are commandments to the ministers
to do that which they do / and here is none: and there the minister does not
command that the breaue be the body of Christ / but he says that it is.
Neither does he command y^ sins should be forgiven / but pronounces in the
behalf of God / that they are forgiven. It is not unlawful also / that he
with the congregation should make a prayer for the assistance / or increase of
God his gifts upon him that is ordained, but to command that he should receive
it / is merely unlawful. For these words (receive the holy ghost) are the
imperative mood / and do expressly signify a commandment. And so the bishop
may as well say to the sea / when it rages and swells / peace / be quiet /
as to say receive the holy ghost. And if you think it so good reason / to use
this in the making of ministers / because you use the words of our savior
Christ / why may not you as well blow upon them as he did? for seeing that our
savior Christ confirmed his word there / with a sacrament / or outward sign /
and you think you must therefore do it / because he did it / you are much to
blame to leave out the outward sign / or sacrament of breath / whereby the
faith of him which is ordained / might be the more assured of such gifts / and
graces as are requisite in his function. I heap not up here the judgment of
the writers / you know / I think / it might casely be done / if I liked to
follow that way.

Answer to the. 50. and. 51. pages.
This passes all the divinity that ever I red / that there are now Apostles /
and Evangelists / and Prophets. You shall assuredly do maruelles if you
prove that / as you say you will / if any deny it / I deny it / prove you it.
And that you may have some thing to do more / then peradventure you thought
of / when you wrote these words / I will show you my reasons why I think there
ought to be none / nor can be none / unless they have wonderful and
extraordinary callings. It must first be understood / that the signification
of this word Apostle / when it is properly taken / extends it self not only
to all the ministers of God being sent of God / but to the ambassadoure of any
Prince or Noble man / or that is sent of any public authority / and is used
of the scripture by the trope of Synechdoche for the twelve / that our savior
Christ appointed to go throughout all the world / to preach the gospel / unto
the which number was added S. Paul and as some think Barnabas / which are
severed from all other ministers of the gospel by these notes.

First that they were immediately called of God / as s. Paul to the Galathians
/ Galath. 1. 1.
proves him self to be an apostle / because he was not appointed by men.

Then / that they saw Christ / which argument S. Paul uses. Am I 1. Cor. 9.
1.
not an Apostle? have I not seen Christ?

Thirdly / that these had the field of the whole world to Till / where as
other are restrained more perticularly / as to a certain ploughe land / wherein
they should occupye them selves. Whereupon it follows / that as we conclude
against the Pope truly / that he can be no successor of the Apostles / not
only because he neither reaches / nor does as they did / but because the
Apostles have no successors / neither any can succeed into the office of an
Apostle: so may we likewise conclude against those / that would have the
Apostles now adays / that there can be none / because there is none / unto
whom all these three notes do agree: as that he is both sent of God
immediately / or that he has seen Christ / or that he is sent into all the
world.

And although some Ecclesiastical writers do call sometimes good ministers
successors of the Apostles yet that is to be understood because they propound
the same doctrine y^ they did / not because they succeeded into the same kind
of function / which they could not do. S. Paul does use this word (Apostle)
sometimes in his proper and native signification for him that is publicly sent
from any to other / as when he speaks of the brethren that were joined with
Titus / which were sent by the churches with relief to the pore church in
Jerusalem and Iewrie / and where he calls Epaphroditus an Apostle. But that
1. Cor. 8. 23. Phillip. 2. 25.
is with addition / and not simply / as in the first place he calls the
brethren the apostles of the Churches / that is not the apostles of all
Churches / or sent to all churches / but the apostles which certain churches
sent with the relief to other certain churches / and Epaphroditus he calls
not an apostle simply / but the apostle of the Philippians / that is which the
Philippians sent with relief to Paul being in prison at Rome / as it
appears in the same Epistle.

And as for Andronicus and Iunius which are by you recited / belyke to prove
that we may have more apostles / because it is said of S. Paul that they were
famous and notable amongst the apostles / it cannot be proved by any thing 16.
Romans 7.
I see there / whether they had any function Ecclesiastical or no. For S.
Paul calls them his kinneffolke / and fellow prisonners / and does not say
that they were his fellow laborers: and a man may be well notable and famous
amongst the apostles / and well known unto them / which is no apostle. And if
the apostles would have had this order of the apostles to continue in the
church / there is no doubt but that they would have chosen one into James his
room when he 12. Acts. 2.
was slain / as they did when they supplied the place of Judas / by choosing
Mathias / and so ever as they had died / the other would have put other in
their places. So it appears that this function of the apostles is ceased.

You ask farther / that if a man should not preach before he have a pastoral
charge / what they will answer unto Phillip and Epaphroditus / whereby your
meaning is belike / that although they be no pastors / yet they may be
evangelists which go about the country here and there* But this office is
ceased in the church / as the apostles is / saving that sometime the Lord does
raise up some extraordinarily / for the building up of the churches which are
fallen down / and pulled up by the foundations / as I have showed somewhat
before. And that it is ceased / it may appear by these reasons.

First / for because all those that the scripture calls precisely Evangelists
/ (which are only Phillip and Timothe) had their callings confirmed by miracle
/ Act. 8. 39. 1. Tim. 1. 18.
and so it is like that Titus / and Syluanus / and Apollos / and if there were
any other / had their vocations after the same manner confirmed / but there is
no such miraculous confirmation now / therefore there is no such vocation. For
allbeit those that God has raised up in those dark times / and overthrows
of the church / whereof mention is made before / as M. Luther. etc. had not
their ^allings always confirmed by direct and manifest miracles of hearing or
raising up from the dead: yet the marvelous succes and blessing that the Lord
gave unto their labors / were sufficient seals unto all men / that although
they had no ordinary calling / nor by men / yet they were sent of God? That I
speak nothing of the miraculous deliverances that some of them had out of
dangers / by warning given of pearils by those which were never seen before
nor after / and by such like wonderful means / as are to be seen in stories.

Now again / if there should be any Evangelist / who should ordain him? you
will say the Bishop. But I say that cannot be / that the greater should be
ordained of the les. For the Euangeliste is a higher degree in the church /
then Heb. 7. 7.
is the bishop or pastor. And if he be so / why has he not his estimation
here in the Church above the Bishop or Archbishop either? for the Archbishop
is but a Bishop / or why does not he ordain Bishops as Timothe and Titus
did / which were Evangelists / being one point of their office as * Eusebius
Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 37.
declares.

Again / if there be in every church a pastor / as S. Paul commands /
what should the Evangelists do? for either that pastor does his duty / and
then the Evangelist is superfluous / or if he do it not / then he is no lawful
pastor / and so ought he to be put out / and an other to be put in his stead.
And where the pastor doing his duty can not suffice / there the scripture has
given him an aid of the doctor / which for because his office consists in
teaching doctrine / to this end y^ the pastor might not be driven to spend
so much time in propounding the doctrine / but might have the more time to
employ in exhorting and dehorting / and applying of the doctrine to the times
and places / and persons / it is manifest that he also is tied to a certain
church. For how could he be an aid unto the pastor to whose help he is given
/ onles he were in the same church where the pastor is? And that the
Evangelists office has been so taken as a function that endured but for a
time / it may appear first by that which Eusebius writes / speaking Lib. 5.
cap. 9. 10
of Pantenus / for says he / there were until that time Evangelists. etc.
which was about the year of our Lord. 162. whereby he gives to understand /
that about that time they ceased / and that in his time there was none / when
notwithstanding there were Bishops or pastors / elders and Deacons. And Ambrose
1. cap. 1. li. offic.
says that there be no Apostles / but those which Christ himself did appoynte
/ whereby it appears that of all the Ecclesiastical functions that preach
the word / there are but the pastor and Doctor only left unto us / and the
same also restrained to particulare charges.

Now that I have proved that there are no Evangelists / Prophets / or Apostles
/ and that the ministeries of the word which remain / are limited unto
certain places / I will take that which you grant / that is / that the
pastor or bishop / ought to have a special flock. And demand of you wherefore
he should have it? is it not to attend upon it? and can he attend upon it /
onles he be resident and abiding upon it? but he can not be abiding upon it /
if he go from place to place to preach where he thincketh necessary: therefore
being pastor or bishop of a congregation allotted unto him / he may not go
from place to place to preach where he thinks good / much les to have a
mastership of a college in one corner of the land / a deanrie in an other /
and a prebend in the third / and so be absent from his pastoral charge in such
places / where either he preaches not / or needs not to preach / those places
being otherwise furnished without him. For the^ how is this difference kept
between the pastor and other ministers / that the one is tied to a place / and
the other is not. For if you say that it is in that he shall preach more at his
flock / then at other places / I answer that the Evangelists and Apostles did
tarry longer in one place then in another / and taught some congregations years
/ when they did not other some months. And therefore they say nothing / which
allege for the non residence of pastors / that S. Paul called Timothe and
Titus from Ephesus and Crete. For first they were Evangelists and no pastors /
the^ 2. Tim. 4. 12. Tit. 3. 12.
they went not of their own heads / but called of the apostle which was a
chief governor of the church. And thirdly they went not / but having other
sufficient put in their place / as it appears in their several Epistles / so
that if that place make any thing / it makes not to prove the non residencie /
but rather whether a minister may be translated from one church to an other.

But I will never wearye my pen to confute those / whom their own
consciences are to strong for / and confuteth every night when they go to bed:
for that were nothing else / but to reason with the belly / that has no ears
to hear / or with the back / that has no eyes to see. Those that think
that they having charges of their own / yet may go from place to place where
they think it necessary / and that it skilleth not where they preach / so
they preach: must consider that if they think that God is the author of their
placing in their flocks / then that either their abode there / is nedeful and
expedient / or else that God did not see well and clearly / what was meet to
be done in placing them over that congregation / and appoynting that that
congregation should hang and depend upon them / for their nourishment and
good government.

And you see that if I would follow those noble metaphores of watchman and
shephard / which the scripture uses to expres the office of a minister with /
what a large field is opened unto me. For then I could show you how that cities
beseged / and flocks in danger of the wolves / are * watched continually night
and day. Luke. 2. 8.
And that there is no city so sore / and so continually besieged / nor no
flocks subject to so manifold diseases at home / or hurtful and devouring
beasts abroad / and that without any truce or intermission / as are the
churches / the shepherds and watchmen whereof / are pastors or bishops. But I
will leave that to their considerations / and will show that the parts and
duties of the minister be such and so many in his own flock / ye if he were
as wise as Solomon was / as great in counsel as Joseph / as well learned as s.
Paul / as active as Iosue / which fought so many battles in small space / yet
all were little enough / or too little / to perform to the full / that which
his charge requires of him. Of the pastors therefore is required / not only
the preaching of the word / and ministering of the sacraments / whereof / the
preaching of the word / and ministering of the sacrament of baptism / ought to
be continually / and as often as the church may conveniently assemble / the other
sacrament of the Lord his supper / although not so continually (for that the
church shall hardly have so much leifure from their necessary affairs of this
life / as that they may celebrate it as often as the other) yet so often / as
that we remember that too rare and seldom celebrating it / argues a mind too
too much forgetful of the unspeakable benefit of our redemption / and
argues also that we are far behind the primitive church in zeal which did
celebrate it every Saboth: I say beside the preaching of the word / and
ministering of the sacraments / there is required of him that he should
admonish privately / and house by house 20. Acts. 20.
those that are under his charge. Now tell me how this can be done profitably
without a diligent marking / and loking into their manners? How can either
public preachings / or private admonitions have their effect and working /
onles the word of God be applied according to the disposition or state of that
people / unto which it is preached? and undoubtedly hereof it comes that the
word of God is no more effectual in this realm then it is / for because it is
preached hand over head without knowledge and understanding the estate of the
people. For so / often times the promises and glad tidings of the gospel of
our savior are preached unto those / that being before secure in their
sins / are after the hearing of the promises / rocked into a dead sleep of
them / and they that are overthrown with the conscience of their sin / and
confounded in them selves / are by the sharpness of the law / and hearing of
the judgment of God broken into pieces / and driven to desperation. And so
likewise / the people are taught sometimes how to lead their lives in honest
conversation / when all that doctrine falls to the ground because they have
no knowledge of Christ / nor of faith in him: and to be short / it is as much
as if either the surgeon should apply his plaster / or the Physician his
medicine / when they neither know of the wound or disease of their pacients.
But this knowledge of their estate / can not be without a continual abode
amongst them / therefore a continual residence is necessary.

Moreover / as in the law the priests were ready in the temple to answer 1.
Sam. 1. 9.
all the doubts and questions that any of the people should come to ask: so
the ministers in their several parishes should be ready to dissolve the
difficulties that either one has with an other / or with him self / touching
the conscience / for want whereof / the consciences of many / after doubtful
and dangerous wrestling with the devil / and with despair are strangled. And
thereupon some hang or drown themselves / some other putting away all care or
conscience of sinning / and laboring to have no sense nor seeling of their
sin / close up the wound unhealed / which after / either breaks out more
daungerously / or else every day more and more waxing senseles / and without
feeling / treasure up unto them selves the wrath of God against the day of
judgment. For although the judgment of God does not for the time follow
them so hard / as them which through terror of conscience vntaughte and
vncomforted / kill them selves: yet their estate is never the les dangerous
therefore / but rather more / for as much as by a longer line of sin drawn
out / they also pull upon them selves a heavier condemnation. Which things when
they see oftentimes before their eyes that will consider it / it is easy to
judge that it comes to pass a great deal oftener then we can see. When as
therefore the only preaching of the word of God being continual / is a bond
strong enoughe to hold the pastor to his flock. Then the inquiry of the
manners and behauioure of his flock / the private admonitions and consolations
/ the dissoluing of doubts when any rises / as a three or four fold cord
ought much more to hold him: so that he which shall break all these things
willingly and wittingly / can not easily be thought to break them as Sampson
did his by the strength of God / but rather by some other power not of God.
Besides that / S. Paul commands that the pastor should be a pattern 1.
Tim. 4. 12.
or example in all goodness / and holiness of life unto his flock / and our
savior Christ * says that when the shepherd has led forth his sheep / he
goes John. 10. 4.
before them / but if the pastoure be not amongst his flock / and have not his
conversation there / they can not follow him: If they have not the example
before their eyes / they can not make the like unto it: Therefore this
commandment also binds them to residence amongste their flocks. S. Peter
wills the pastors 1. Pet. 5. 2.
of the churches / that they should feed the flocks. What flocks? not every
one / but those which are committed to their faith or trust / or which
depends upon them. And S. Paul speaking to the ministers or bishops of
Ephesus / 20. Acts. 28.
wills them that they should take heed unto the flocks / over the which the
holy Ghost had made them overseers / where he restrains as S. Peter did
their oversight and watch unto their perticulare flock. S. Paul says that
he took 1. These. 2. 17.
it heauely / that he was separated from them but a small time / if therefore
the Apostle was away with grief from them whom he had taught / whom his
calling compelled to be away from / and would not suffer to be always there:
what shall be thought of the pastors / whose calling is to be with their
flocks / and which are consecrated unto them / even as the Apostles were unto
the whole world / what I say shall be thought of them that are away months
and years. And in deed those that feed their flocks faithfully according to
the commandment of God / do see what a great wisdom and mercy of God it is
to appoint every flock his pastor / and every pastor his flock. They can tell
of a wonderful love that God works in them toward their flocks / and in
their flocks toward them. A great encouragement unto them / and as it were a
prick to stir up their dulnes it is / when they see the blessing of God
upon their labors / and thereof a marvelous care and thought to turn all
such things away / as should hinder the increase of that blessing / which they
can not have any feeling or experience of / which are not conuersante with
their flocks. Besides this / a familiarity between the pastor and the flock
is profitable / that they may be emboldened to come and demand to be
satisfied of those things they doubt of / which they will never do unto those
/ whom they are not by continual conversation acquainted with. And it is not
nothing / that Aristotle disputes against Plato his community / which would
have all things common / and that all men indifferently should have care of
all things / and should have nothing which he should say to be his own. For
therein Aristotle said very well / that that which was cared for of all men /
was neglected of all / and cared for of none / so that the preservation of wife
or children / or of any other possession / was then the best and surest / when
as every man had a certain possession committed unto him / which he should
care for / and take charge of. And so the Lord his wisdom was for the better
surety and salvation of his church / not to make many ministers which should
in common and indifferently take care of all / but ordained that the church
should be divided into diverse parts / and that every one should have a piece
to care for / and to give account for.

Now if any man will say / that in such great scarcity of pastors / it is
good that when a man has traveled in one place / and removed them from
superstition / and brought them to believe in God through Christ / to go to an
other place / and assay also to draw them from idolatry: First I urge that
which I did before / which is the calling wherein every man must abide / and
without y^ which no man ought to attempt any thing. Then I say that it is as
hard a province / and as painful a thing unto the pastor / as acceptable and
precious a work unto the Lord / to keep those which are gotten / as to get
those which are not gotten / and that that saying is fulfilled here (if in any
thing else.)

Non minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tueri.

It is as great a virtue to keep that which is already gotten / as to have got
it.

For we know that after that the devil perceives / that men are pulled out of
the power of darkness / into the glorious light of the gospel / he sweateth and
labors by a thousand means to destroy them / and bestirreth him self more
then / then in the time of their ignorance / and in stead of that one chain
of ignorance / and want of the knowledge of god / he lays a thousand traps
for them / to snare them with. So that the continual danger that the church is
in / does as it were speak unto the pastor in the common proverb. Sparten
hen claches kosma: that is / look diligently to that charge which thou haste
received. For / if the watchman should forsake the City / whereunto he is
appointed / and go and watch in an other / where he is not called / although
he save that / if he lose the other / he shall not therefore escape the
punishment of betraying the other city / where he was placed watchman.

Touching the behalf of God and his glory / if any man will say that they can
not pearish / which once have believed / and therefore those may be left / and
others attempted / I can say of those that are in ignorance and blindness / that
they cannot pearish that be elected / although they never have the gospel
preached. And therefore we must walk in those ways that God has appointed /
to bring them to salvation / which is to feed them continually / and watch
over them so long as they are in danger of hunger / in danger of wolves / in
danger of the enemies / within and without / which is so long as the church is
here upon the earth.

Upon all which things I conclude / that the residence of the pastor is
necessary / and to dout whether the pastor ought to be resident amongst his
flock / is to doubt whether the watchman should be in his tower / the eye
should be in the head / or the soul in the body / or the shepherd amongst
his flock / especially where the sheep are continually in danger of wolves /
as in the land of Iewrie from whence this similitude or manner of speech was
taken / where they watched their flocks night and day / as I observed before
out of S. Luke.

If any man will hereupon conclude / that they have no space given them to
sleep / to eat / to drink. etc. they are cauils / which I will not vouchsafe to
answer.

Again / if he will say / that then they may not go for the of the town to
do their necessary business for their families / I desire them in the name of
God / that they abuse not his graces / in devising cloakes to cover their
disorders / but yt they would set before them the love of Christ / which shall
be found to be so much as 21. Ihon. 15. 16. 17.
they shall show themselves diligent in continual feeding their flocks / and
to fear the judgment of God / before whom / no fained or colored excuse
will stand: and so I trust they will make no longer absences / then must
needs. And if upon any occasion at any time they be somewhat longer / that the
same be not without the leave of their churches whose they are / and which they
for the Lord his sake serve / and then also that in such rare and necessary
absence / they provide them of some able man to teach in the mean season /
which the church by her gouernoures / will allow of.

And hereupon also / is ended an other question that the answerer makes /
whether one may have many flocks / which is / whether one shepherd may be
many shepherds / one watcheman / many watchmen. For if his residence be
necessary in one place / then he ought to content him self with one.

And whereas you would have men charitably judge of those which take many
lyuinges: surely / if so be that he takes many flocks / not to the intent to
have more living to mayntaine an ambitious pomp / or to satisfy a greedy
desire / of having more then enough / but to this end y^ he may bring in a more
plentiful harnest unto the Lord: it were good that he would be content to
take but that living of all his flocks / which he now has of one / especially
where one is able to keep and maintain him and his family honestly. Else let
him hear what councels / and others / have thought of those / which have more
benefices then one.

In the. 15. Canon of the council of Nice it is commanded / that no clearke
should be placed in two Churches / and he adds the reasons / whereof the
first is / that it is a point of marchaundise / and of filthy gain. The
second / that Math. 6. 24. 1. Cor. 7. 24.
no man can serve two masters. The third / that every one ought to * tarry in
that calling / wherein he is called.

And in the second Tome of the Councelles / Damasus in his fourth Epistle /
lykeneth those that set over their charges unto other / unto harlots / which
as soon as they have brought forth their children / by and by give them to be
nourished of others / to the intent that they might the sooner fulfill their
inordynare lusts.

Whether it were better y^ one dyligent pastoure should have many flocks /
then a neglygent and unskillful pastor one / is not the question: for we say
neither is lawful / nor ought to be done.

Do you believe that which you set down of Denis the monk and Pope / that
he devised and divided parishes? If you do not / why would you have us
beeleeue it? If the law does condemn him / that turns a blind man out of
Deuteronomy. 27. 18.
the way / or lays a block before him / what does it him / which would put
out the eyes of them that see their way already? I have showed / and the matter
is plain / that the Lord divided national churches / into parishes and
congregations: so that if S. Paul have not the word of parish / yet he has
the thing. And those that have read stories / know that dioiceris (which we
call a Diocese / and which contains with us numbers of parishes) was at the
first taken to be the same that parish is / and used a great while before
Denis was borne / or monkery begotten.

And as for Coemeteria or Churchyardes / if you mean those places that lie
next round about the churches / as they came in with the monk / they might
well have gone out with him / for any profit either to the church / or common
wealth comes by them. But if you mean as the Greek word (which is there
used) signifies / a fit place where the bodies of men sleep / and are
buried / attending the time of their rising up again in the last and general
day of judgment / then these churchyardes were in the time of the law / and in
the primitive church and at all times / when there was any outward policy of
the church / and especially when the church had quietness and peace / that it
might without danger * bury their dead in some certain convenient place
thereunto appointed / Luke 7. 12. Eus. 7. lib. 13.
which was for fear of the infection commonly (as it may be gathered) in the
field and out of the town / unto the which use and custom (if it might be
done conveniently) it were well that we were restored / both because it is more
safe for the preservation of the towns and cities in their health / as also
for that through the superstition which has been of being buried rather in
the church / then in the church yard / in the chauncell rather then in the
church / nearer the high altar then further of / the remnantes whereof are in
a great number of men's hearts yet / which might much be helped by the bringing
in of that custom again / of burying the dead in some honest place out of
the town thereto appointed.

To the next sections in the. 52. and. 53. pages.
IF you should begette / and be a father of many books / and all your
children like their eldest brother / you would (without better advise) shake
many grounds of our religion. For here again you wyshe that all pastors
were able to teach / but that being impossible (as the estate is now) you are
content with pastors or ministers that can do nothing but read. You through
out your whole book make this a marvelous good estate / and always turn the
best side outward / and when men go about to urge the deformities thereof /
to the end they might be remedyed / then you lay open the shame and
nakedness of it / and make it greater then it is in deed. For as I have
showed before / the church stands not so much in need of your reading
ministers / as you would make the world believe. And although it be a great
deformity and sore plage of the church which you here speak of and confess
at unawares / yet you will let no man come near to heal it. There be some make
a gain by sores / and sore legs / and therefore they have a medicine to
keep their wounds always green / that they should not heal.

I hope you do not of purpose keep the church in this estate / but this I
dare say / that the chief of your gain and of your honor consists and is
grounded in the ruins of the church / and therefore I desire you to look unto
it.

But what if the estate of the church be such as you speak of / that it will
skarce yield three preaching pastors and bishops in some diocese / may you
therefore make reading ministers? In deed if the Apostle had made this a
counsel only / and no commandment / that pastors of churches should be able
to teach / then your saying might have been borne.

But seeing that S. Paul has commanded expressedly / that he should 1. Tim.
3. 2. Tit. 1. 9.
be able to teach / and to convince the gaynesayers / I would learn of you
gladly / what necessity there is which can cause a man to break the moral
law of God / to bring in a tradytion of man. You may as well break any other
commandment of God for necessyties sake / as break this / being comprehended
in the first table.

And to say that these that can only read / must be tolerated in the church as
ministers / is to say / because you can have no pastors in the churches / you
will have idolles. For so will I not doubt to call them / although through
ignorance of that which they do / some may be good men. But yet in respect of
the place that they occupy / they are idolles / for they stand for that / and
make show of that / which they are not / and admit you them as often as you
will / the Lord pronounces that they shall be no ministers to him / which have
Ozee. 4. 6.
no knowledge.

But let us hear your reason / there must be reading in the church /
therefore there must be ministers which can do nothing else. Then we may
reason thus to. There must be breaking of bread / and distributing of the cup
in the church / and pouring on water / therefore whosoever is able to break a
loaf of bread / or to lift a cup of wine / or to pour on water on the body of
the child / may be made a minister.

And did you never read that there were readers in the church / when there
were no reading ministers? but of reading of the scriptures and prayers in the
church / there will be a fitter place to speak afterward where it shall be
showed / how unjustly you surmise these things of them.

Touching Homilies shall be spoken more hereafter / where further occasion is
given. I do not use to maintain the places which are quoted / although they
be truly alleged for the causes which I have before mentioned / but yet I can
not but speak of this place of S. Luke / for fear of the danger that may
ensue. 9. Luke 2.
For if this be a good reason / that the place of S. Luke may not be used to
prove that preaching is perpetually annexed to the ministry / because in the
same place is made mention of curing of diseases / which is but a temporal
thing / and followed the ministry but for a time / then the commandment of
S. James Iam. 5. 14.
that the Elders of the Church should pray for those that are sick / is now
no commandment / because putting on of hands / and annoynting of them / that
they might recover their health / has no place / and by this means you
will pull from us many places of the new Testament / as you did before of the
old.

What dealing is this / to bring men into suspicion of that / which they never
thought of / as though there were any word that sounded to this / that a man
should put him self into the office of preaching / without the approbation of
those men to whom it does pertayne.

Their complaynt is / that those which are ordained pastors / and therefore to
preach / can not do it without further license. As if a man should be charged
to do a thing forthwith / and then he that charge him / binds him hand
and foot / that he can not do it / unless he will lose him.

The Bishops inhable him to teach / and point him a place to teach in /
and yet they will not let him teach / unless he have a further license. If
he be an heretic or schismatike / or suspected of any such thing / why is
he admitted / or being admitted / why is he suffered to be so much as a reader
in the church? And because you could not answer this / therefore you set up a
fancy of youres to confute. And thus you fight without an adversary / and you
make triumphs / where there is no victory.

They will say unto you / that not only under a godly Magistrate / but not in
the time of persecution any man ought to take upon him any function in the
church / unless he be thereunto called by men / except he have a wonderful
calling / which is rare / and must be diligently examyned by them which have it
/ least under pretense of the spirit of God whom they make author of their
calling / it fall out that it be but their own headlong affection that has
thrust them in: so far they are from the frensic of Anabaptists / which you
by a confutation of that / which they never affirmed / would seem to stain
them with.

To the section beginning in the latter end of the. 53. page / until the
midst of the 62. page.
THe Cappe / the Surplice / and Tippet / are not the greatest matters we
strive for / which notwithstanding has been informed to the churches beyond
sea / to the end that the judgments of some might be the eastyer had against
us. Howbeit we think it an attire unmeet for a minister of the gospel to
wear / and the Surplice especially / more then the other two / because such
hurtful ceremonies are so much more dangerous / as they do approach nearer
the scruice / or worship of God.

The causes why we are loathe to meddle with them / are not as many are borne in
hand / because that we think any pollution so to stick to the thinge^ them
selves / as that the wearing of them had any such power to pollute and make
unclean the users of them: neither yet only because the papists have
superstitionsly used them / but because they having been abhominably abused by
them / have no use nor profit in those things or ends / wherein and
whereunto they are now used. And further that they are also hurfull / being
monuments of idolatry / whereas to bring them in and establishe them / it
behooves that there should some manifest profit of them appear. For it is
not enoughe to say it is indifferent in the own nature / Ergo meet to be
done: but as the circumstances of the times and persons and profit or hurt of
our brethren do require / or not require / so must it be done / or not be done.
For in these things which are called indifferent / God will have the use of
them to be measured / that it be referred first to his glory / then to the
profit of others. Now / that they are not profitable and hurtful / it also
may appear if we consider them by all the kinds of men in ye realm.

The papists are either stubborn or weak / and in respect of both these /
they can not be but hurtful. The weak I call those that have made some step
from popery to the gospel / and of whom there is good hope that they may be
fully gotten to the gospel / but these are harmed by the use of these
vestimentes / for they take occasion of falling at them / because they thinck
that the sacraments get reverence by them / and the ministry is commended
by such apparel wearing / and think that the sacraments want some thing of
that they should have / if they be not used: whereupon are heard oftentimes
these voices. I will not communicate unless he wear a surplice. But this
offense and occasion of falling / is confirmed by the use of these garments:
therefore in respect of such men / they are hurtful.

Again / although I have knowledge / and know that the wearing of a surplice
is lawful for me / yet an other which has not knowledge / is by my example
edifyed / or strengthened to wear a surplice / whereof he can tell no ground
why he should wear it / and so synneth against his conscience: and for this
cause S. Paul concludes / that that which a man may do in respect of him
self / may not ^. Cor. 8. 10. 13
be done / and is not lawful to be done / in respect of other.

Again for the stubberne papists / they take hereupon occasion to speak
evil of / and to blaspheme the truth of the gospel / saying / that our
religion can not stand by it self / unless it lean upon the staff of their
ceremonies / and persuade them selves that those were very well devised by
their Popes / that they that are their enemies to their religion / can not be
without. And heereuppon they take occasyon to hope that their other trumpery
and baggage / will in the end come in again / which causes them to be more
frosen in their wickedness / and shut their ears against the truth / which
possibly they would hear / if all hope of bringing in of their Popery were
cut off. And let it be observed that through out the realm there are none
that make such clamoures and ouctryes / and complayntes for these ceremonies /
as they / and those that they suborne. They pretend I confess / the Queens
majesty's Injunctions / and obedience unto them / but who is so blind as sees
not / that they have an other meaning. For I appeal unto the consciences of
all that know them / whether they do it for any obedience toward her
Majesty / whose death should be a thousand times better news unto them /
then her graces marriage.

There are also numbers of those which have all antichristianitie in such
detestation / that they cannot abide the least scrappe of it / and when they
see the ministers wear them / they are grieved in their hearts / and they
begin somewhat to fear / least this communicating with the papists in
apparel / should make some way to those which use them / the easyer to admit
other things / when they should be likewise commanded. And these brethrens
minds are not to be lightly grieved / and the ministers if they think to
profit them / must cut away all occasion / whereby they may have an evil
opinion of them.

Seeing that therefore this kind of ceremonies in apparel / harden the hearts of
the papists / and cause them to be the stiffer in their popery / hinder the
weak from profiting in the knowledge of the gospel / grieve the minds of the
godly / are occasion of an evil opinion unto them of their ministers / we
think that these ceremonies are to be removed / as not only not profitable
(which they ought to be) but hurtful / if not to the ministers them selves
that use them / yet to their people to whom they are commanded by God to have
regard unto / in these things that are indifferent in their own natures. Now
I will come to that which you set down.

The places alleged by the admonition / with others / which may be cited /
howsoever you deride them / are notwithstanding probable conjectures / that
neither Samuel / nor the apostles / nor our savior Christ / did wear any
distinct apparel from others / which lived in their times. For if Samuel
being then the 1. Sam. 9. ^8.
seer / had had a several apparel / which was proper to the seers / it is not
like that Saul would have asked of him self where his house was. And if the
apostles Mat. 26. 73.
had worn a several apparel from the rest / they should not have been
esteemed by so general and uncertain a note / as of speaking somewhat brodely /
or as I may term it / Northenly / for it had been a surer note to have said
thou art one of his apostles / because none wears this apparel but his
apostles / where there was a great number that spoke Galilcan like / which were
not of his apostles / nor disciples neither. But let these go. You say our
savior Christ had a several John. 19. 23.
apparel / because he had a coat without seame. Assuredly you might use les
scornefulnes in rehearsing of other men's arguments / if for no other cause /
yet for this / that they might take more pity of youres.

For what an argument is this? Our savior Christ did wear an under garment /
which could not be well parted / but with the spoil or marring of it /
therefore he ware a several apparel from the rest. It is true / Ihon Baptist
had Math. 3. 4. 2. Reg. 1. 8.
a several apparel / and to help you / so had Elias / but to this end /
that both by his unwonted apparel / and strange diet which he used of
locustes and wild honey / the extraordinaries of his ministry might be set
forth / and the people the rather moved to enquire of his office / whom they
saw to vary so much from the common custom of other men. But ministers now
have no such extraordinary functions / therefore by that reason of youres /
they should not be severed from other men / by any note of apparel. You say you
know that the chief notes of a minister / are doctrine and learning / if you
mean that the distinction of apparel must supply the rest / and that that
also has some force to commend their ministry / the prophets and apostles of
our savior Christ / left us no perfect pattern of a minister / nor no
sufficient glass to dres him by / whereof the most part never used any such
several apparel / and none of them have left any commandment of it.

For want of store / and to make a long book / here is S. John's miter
rehearsed thrice in one leaf to the same purpose / and in the same words. And
because it was not enough that M. Bullinger / and M. Martyr should speak of
them / you have prevented them both / least you should have seemed to have
brought nothing. If this be not Coleworts twice sodden / I can not tell what is.

You ask whether the christian magistrate may enjoin a several kind of
apparel to the ministers. Either the cause is too weak which you defend / or
else it has gotten an evil patron / which would so gladly shift it / and
change it with an other. For this is an other question which you speak of.
For although that be granted unto you / which you demand / yet you can not
conclude your cause. For all be it the magistrate may command a several
apparel / yet it follows not that he may command this kind of popish
apparel / and therefore what manner of argument is this of youres / the
magistrate may command a several apparel / therefore he may command this.
The college walls will tell you / that a man can not conclude from the whole
to the part affirmatively. So you see I might let you fish / and catch nothing
/ but I am neither afraid / nor ashamed / to tell you the truth of that you
ask / so farreforth at least as I am persuaded. I think therefore it may be
such a kind of apparel / as the magistrate commanding it / the minister may
refuse it / and such it may be / as he may not refuse it. But whatsoever
apparel it be / this commandment can not be without some injury done to the
minister. For seeing that the magistrate does allow of him / as of a wise /
learned / and discrete man / and trusts him with the government of his
people in matters between God and them / it were somewhat hard not to trust
him with the appoynting of his own apparel / and he is probably to be
supposed that he has discretion to wear his own gear comely / and in order
/ that is able to teach others / how they should wear theirs? and that he
should be able to do that by his wisdom / and learning / that others do
without learning and great store of wisdom / and that he should keep order
and decency in apparel / which has learned in the schole of Christ / which
they do that had never other scholemaster / then common sense and reason? And
if any minister be found to fault / in going either dissolutely / or to
exquisitely and delicately / then the Magistrate may punish him according to
the disorder wherein he faulteth.

And whereas you would prove that it may be done with the ministers / as it is
done with Judges / sergeants / Aldermen and Sheriffs / the case is not like.
For as for these which be in office / their robes and gowns may as their maces
and swords / somewhat help to set forth the majesty and moderate pomp which
is meet for the offices of justice which they execute / and consequently to
help to strike a profitable fear into their hearts which are underneath them
/ which has / nor can have no place in the minister / whose authority and
power / as it is not outward / so can it not / nor ought not to borow any
credit of these external shows. And the Magistrate / or the City / may
seek some honor of the citizens / mustering as it were by numbers in one
liuerie / which ought not to be looked for at the ministers hand / because he
honors and serves the magistrate an other way / nor can not also /
considering that they are scattered through all the land in every town one /
or not so many / as being put in one livery / would make any great show to the
honor and commendation of the town or city where they remain.

And so you see your question answered / whereby appears they are subjects
as other are / and to obey also sometimes / where the commandment is not
given upon good grounds. The place of Theodoret cited of M. Bullinger / makes
mention of a golden cope / and that used by bishops of Jerusalem / and sold by
Cyrill a good bishop / whereby he declared sufficiently his misliking of such
garments in the ministry of the sacraments. In the place the which he
cites out of Socrates / there is one Sycinius an Nouatian bishop which is said
to have worn white apparel / and therefore is reprehended as for to much
exquisiteness and finenesse of apparel / and the B. of Duresine / in a letter
he wrote / alleges the same place against the surplice. A man would hardly
believe that master Bullinger should use these places to prove a distinction
of apparel amongst the ministers. We are not ignorant but that a cloak has
been used of the ministers in their service / but that was no several apparel
of the ministers / but common to all the Christians / which with change of
their religion / changed also their apparel / as appears manifestly in
Tertullian de pallio.

As for the Petalum that S. John ware / I see not how it can be proved / to be
like a bishops miter. For the cap / that S. Cyprian gave the executioner /
argues rather that it was ye common apparel which was customably worn / for
else it would not have done him so much good. As for his upper garment which
he gave to his deacon / it was a token of his good will / which he would leave
with him / as the practice has been seen with us / and proves nothing that
it was any several apparel. As for the white linen garment which he suffered
in / it can not seem strange unto us which have seen the holy martyrs of the
Lord executed in Smithfield and other places. And it is not to be thought that
S. Cyprian had so small judgment / that living in the time of persecution / he
would by wearing of some notable apparel from the rest / as it wear betray
him self into the hands of his enemies / unless all the christians had done so
too for clearer and more open profession of their faith / and greater
detestation of the contrary religion: as Tertullian and the christians in his
time did / by the wearing of a cloak / which reason may be also alleged of the
Petalum of S. John. It is true 60. homil. ad popul. Antiod^.
Chrysostom makes mention of a white garment / but not in commendation of it
/ but rather to the contrary. For he shows that the dignity of their
ministry / their safety and crown was in taking heed / that none unmeet
were admitted to the Lords supper / not in going about the church with a white
garment. And it is easily to be seen by * Solomon in his Ecclesiastes / that
to wear a white Eccle. 9. 8.
garment / was greatly esteemed in the East parts / and was ordinary to those
that were in any estimation / as the wearing of black with us: and therefore
was no several apparel for the ministers / or for to execute their ministry
in.

The reasons that M. Peter Martyr uses / are the same before / and how he has
also condemned them / it shall appear / with M. Bucers judgment of these
things in the end of the book.

As for Eustathius his deprivation / because he did not wear apparel meet for
a minister / it makes not to this purpose one whit. For I have showed that if
any minister go like a ruffian or swashe buckler / or in the bravery of a
courtier / that it is meet he should be punished according to the quaintitie
of the fault. And that it is so to be understood / it appears manifestly by
the council of Gangris / which did therefore confirm the same deposing /
because he ware a stranger apparel / and the habit of a Philosopher / and
caused all his fellows to do so. Therefore I marvel what you mean to allege
this place. It is also alleged of * Nicephorus Lib. 9, c. 45.
/ in neither of ye places there is any Eustathius / ye son of Eustathius /
but of Eulabius / or as Nicephorus reads Eulalius. And therefore your
conclusion is both untrue and uncertain / that since the Apostles times there
has been a distinct and several apparel of the ministers from the rest. The
matter lies not in that whether these things were first muented by papists /
or being devised of others / were after taken by the papists / but ye matter
stands in this / that they have been used of the papists as notes and marks
and sacraments of their abominations.

As for Augustine his place / it is to be understood of such things as have a
necessary use / and therefore may not be taken away from us by the superstition
of men. For so we might also be deprived of the sun / which is as it were the
life of the world / because the sinme has been worshipped. But that S.
Augustine August. Tom. 10. de verbis domini in Matheum sermon. 6.
did not like of this kind of retayning ceremonies / it may * appear. Do you
ask says he / how the Paganes may be won / how they may be brought to
salvation / forsake their solemnities / let go their toys / and then if they
gree not unto our truth / let them be ashamed of their fewness / whereby he
shows / that the nearest way to gain the papists / is to forsake their
Ceremonies. And yet I would be loath to say either with you / or with Augustine /
that it is not lawful for a man / to make of a popish surplice / a shirt for
him self / or to take the gold of a cope which he has bought / and convert it
to his private use. And herein we do nothing disagree with S. Augustine / which
grant that surplices / and copes / and rippets / and cappes / may be applied
to a good use / either common or private / as they will best serve / but we
deny that that use is in distinguishing either the ministers from other men /
or the ministers executing their ecclesiastical function from themselves /
when they do not exercise that office.

To all these things that M. Martyr reckeneth up of revenues / and wages /
verses / wine / bread / oil / water / which being consecrated unto Idols / are
well used / Tertullian answeareth in the same book / whereout a number of these
are taken: when he says / that we ought to admit a participation of those
things / which bring either a necessity or profit in the use of them / but we
deny that these things thus used / are either necessary or profitable. And
therefore in stead of temples / tithes / wine. etc. if you would have matched
the surplice well / you should have said sensors / tapers / holy bread / holy
water / and such like. It is true / that M. Bucer says / that it is not in
the nature of any creature to be a note of Antichrist / but yet follows not
thereof / that the creature that has been accidentally / and through abuse
applied to idolatry / may be forthwith used as we shall think good. For
neither the idolles of the Gentiles / nor the corruptions of those which
offered / had power to make the beef or mutton that was offered / no good and
wholesome meat for the sustenaunce of man / neither cause that a Christian man
could not eat them as beef and mutton / but yet either to eat it at the
table of idolles before them / or else privately in his own house / when there
was any weak by / that thought it an abominable thing / was not lawful:
and yet the meat nevertheless the good creature of God / and which might be
received with thanks giving / so the abuse of the surplice and coape. etc. can
not cause / but that they may be used as clothe and silk.

And whereas he says that they are changed / and made of notes of
Antichristianitie / marks of Christianity / I say that they can not be
changed so by any decree or commandment / for as much as notwithstanding
that profession of change / the hearts of men unto which every man must have
regard unto / are not changed. For not so soon as the magistrate will say
that these things shall be from henceforthe used as things indifferent /
forthwyth men do use them so / but those only use them so / which have
knowledge / both the ignorant and the weak take them still otherwise. The rest
of those things which M. Bucer / and those which M. Bullinger and Gualter bring
/ are all of that sort / whereunto answer is made.

Only this they add / that if the people do abuse and pervert these ceremonies
/ they ought to be better instructed / which is a counsel not so convenient /
that the ministers and pastors which have so many necessary points to bestow
their time on / and to inform the people of / should be driven to cut of
their time appointed thereto / to teach them not to abuse these things / which
if they use never so well / they can gain nothing / and to take heed that
they hurt not them selves at those things / which in their best estate do no
good / especially when one sermon of the taking of them away joined with
authority to execute it / may do more good then a thousand sermons without
authority.

Besides that / it is absurd / that ceremonies which ought to be helpers to
promote the doctrine / should become lets and hindrances / whilst the
minister is occupied in teaching / to beware of the abuse of them / and of
superstition. And it is as much as if one should be set to watch a child all
day long / least he hurt him self with the knife / when as by taking away the
knife quite from him / the danger is avoided / and the service of the man
better employed. And so it follows / that although the church may appoint
ceremonies and rites / yet it can not appoynte these that have great
incommoditye / and no commodity / great offense and no edifying.

And although they have all these properties which you recite / yet if they be
not to edifying / if not to God his glory / if not comely and agreeable to the
simplicity of the gospel of Christ crucified / they may not be established.
Concerning your distinction / whereby you lesten the idolatry of the papists /
I have showed the vanity thereof.

But of this matter you say you will speak again. In deed so you do / and
again / wherein you confound the memory and understanding of the reader / and
declare your self not only ignorante of Aristotle's rule of katholou proton
(which is to speak of one thing generally and once for all) but even to be
void of that order which men have commonly by the natural logic of reason.
Neither can you excuse your self in saying that the Admonition gives you so
often times occasion to speak of them / and so to lay the fault upon it / for
that it being written by diverse persons of the same matters / whereof one knew
not of an others doing / can not be blamed for the repetition of one thing
twice / when as you can not escape blame which might have gathered easily into
one place / y^ which is said of them in diverse. Which thing / although it be
not so easy for me to do in your book / as it was for you to do in theirs /
yet I will assay to do it both in this and in all other points that follow /
not thincking thereby to bring this treatise of youres to any good order (for
that were to cast it new again / and then you would complain of your mind
perverted) but that I might remedy this so great disorder as far as may be
done without changing any thing of that which you have set down.

And if there be any other arguments touching any of these points in other
places / which I have not gathered together into one / the fault is in this /
that I could not bestow so much time in making a Harmony of the things which
are at so great discord / and then that which is left out / shall be answered
in place where I shall find it. Now let us see M. Doctors deuteron ploun, and
second navigations touching apparel / whether it be any happier / or have any
better succes then the first.

In the. 105. page / M. Doctor to prove the use of the surplice / to draw out
his book into some competent volume / boroweth certain places of the examiner /
for answer whereunto / I will refer the reader to that which is answered
unto the examination / as to a full and sufficient answer wherein I will rest
/ and when M. Doctor has proved that which he says / that it is but a
childishe cavil / he shall then hear further.

In the mean season it is but a slender Reply / to so learned an answer
(that proves both out of other authors / and out of those same which the
examiner cites / that by a white garment is meant a comely apparel / and not
sloue^ly) to say it is but a childishe cavil / which a D. of Divinity / and
of. xl. years of age can not answer. The place of Jerome upon the. 44. of
Ezechiel / the more it be considered / the more shall appear the truth of the
answer.

Now I will desire the reader to turn unto the. 237. 238. 239. 240. 242. pages
/ to see whether at this third voyage M. doctor brings any better
marchaundise. Where first he surmiseth an untruth / as though the admonition
misliked of the taking away of the gray Amiss / where it says only that there
was les cause to take that away / then the surplice. etc. Wherein there is
nothing but the truth said / for because that was used but in few churches /
and but of few also in those few churches: therefore if there were cause to take
away that / there was greater to take away the surplice. And to take away the
Amiss out of the church / and leave the surplice. etc. is to heal a scratch /
and leave a wound unhealed.

Now whereas you say / that we are always (Ad oppositum) and that if the law
commanded straightly / that we should wear none of this apparel / that then
we would wear: if it should be answered again that you do Seruire scenae:
that is / that you are a time seruer / you see we might speak with more
likelyhoode then you. But we will not take (as you do) the judgment of God
out of his hands / but will attend patiently the revelation and discovering
of that / which is now hid both in you and in us.

And although you will grant us neither learning nor conscience / yet you
might aforde us so much wit / as that we would not willingly / and of
purpose want those commodities of life / which we might otherwise enjoy as well
as you if we had that gift of conformity which you have.

Whereas you say that the accursed things of Jericho / and the ox that was fed
to be sanctified unto Baall / and the wood consecrated unto the Idol / were
converted to the service of the living God / when you shall prove that the
surplice is so necessary to the service of God / as gold / and silver / and
other metal / and as oxen and wood / whereof the first sort were such / as
without the which / the temple could not be builte / the other / such as were
expressly commanded of God / to be used in his service / then I will confess
that this place makes some thing for you. And yet if your copes / and
surplices. etc. should have such a purgation by fire / as those metalles had
/ or ever the Lord would admit them into his treasure house / and should be
driven to pass from popery unto the gospel / by the chimney / the fire would
make such wrack with them / that they should need have better legs / then
your arguments / to bring them into the church.

Moreover / do you not see here / that you have not losed the knot / but cut
it. For the authors of the Admonition object the place of Esaias / and you
obiecte 30. Chap. 22.
again / the places of Deuteronomie / and of the Judges / this is to oppose
sword against sword: in stead that you should have first holden out your
buckler / and latched the blow of your adversary. As for churches / it has been
answered that they have a profitable use / and therefore very evil compared
with the surplice / which beside that it brings no profit / hurts also as
is before said.

To be short (says M. Doctor) when he recites me almost a whole side word for
word / as he has cited before / where he has had his answer. After this he
sets him self to prove that they edifye / and that first by M. Bucers / and
M. Martyrs authority / and yet in their words before alleged / there is not
a word of edifying. If he gather it of their words / the answer is already
made. Then he brings reasons to prove it / whereof in the first he seems to
reason / that because it is commanded by a lawful magistrate / and lawful
authority / therefore it edifieth. As though a lawful magistrate does nothing
at any time unlawfully / or as though a lawful and a godly magistrate / does
not sometimes command things / which are inconuement and unlawful. Saul was
a lawful magistrate / and did command unlawful things. David was a lawful
and godly magistrate / and yet there slipped from him commandments / which
were neither lawful / nor godly. But he adds that it is done for order / and
for decency / without superstition / or suspicion of it. This is that which is
in controversy / and ought to be proved / and M. Doctor still takes it as
granted / and still faulteth in the petition of the principle / wherewith he
charge others.

The second reason is / that they that wear this apparel / have edified / and
do edify: which is / as if a man would say / the midwiues which lied unto
Pharao / did much good amongst the Israelites / Ergo, their lying did much
good. If Exodus 1. 19.
he will say / the comparison is not like / because the one is not sin in his
own nature / whereas the other is sin / then take this: One that stammereth
and stutteth in his to^g / edifieth the people / therefore stammering and
stutting / is good to edify. For what if the Lord give his blessing unto his
word / and to other good gifts which he has that preaches and wears a
surplice. etc. Is it to be thought therefore / that he likes well of the
wearing of that apparel? This is to assign the cause of a thing to that /
which is not only not the cause thereof / but some hinderance also / and
s^aking of that / whereof it is supposed to be a cause. For a man may rather
reason / that for as much as they which preach with surplice. etc. edify /
(notwithstanding that they thereby drive away some / and to other some give
^^spition of evil. etc.) if they preached without wearing any such thing /
they should edify much more. And yet if a man were assured to gain a thousand
/ by doing of that which may offend / or cause to fall one brother / he ought
not to do it.

The third reason is / yt they which consent in wearing the surplices / consent
also in all other points of doctrine / and they that do not wear it / do not
consent / not so much as amongst them selves. If this consent in the points of
religion be in the surplice / cope. etc. tell us I beseech you / whether in the
matter / or in y^ form / or in what hid and unknown quality stands it? if it
be in that the ministers use all one apparel / then it is marvel that this
being so strong a bond to hold them together in godly unity / that it was
never commanded of Christ / nor practiced of prophets or apostles / never of
no other reformed churches. I had thought wholly / that those things which the
lord appoynteth to maintain and keep unity with / and especially the holy
sacraments of baptism / and of the lords supper / had been strong enough to
have first of all knit us unto the lord / and therefore also to his doctrine /
and then one of us to an other / and that the dissenting in such a ceremony as
a surplice. etc. neither should nor could in those that pertain unto God /
break the unity of the spirit / which is bound with the bond of truth. And
although there be which like not this apparel / that think otherwise then
either their brethren / or then in deed they ought to do / yet a man may find
greater dissent amongst those / which are united in surplice and cope. etc.
then there is / amongst those which wear them not / either with them selves / or
with them that wear them. For how many there are that wear surplices / which
would be gladder to say a mass / than to hear a sermon / let all ye world
judge. And of those y^ do wear this apparel / and be otherwise well minded to
ye gospel / are there not which will wear ye surplis / and not ye cap: other ye
will wear both cap and surplice / but not the tippet / and yet a third sort /
ye will wear surplice / cap / and tippet / but not the cope. It has been the
manner always of wise and learned men / to esteem of things by the causes / and
not by the event / and that especially in matters of religion / for if they
should be esteemed of the event / who is there which will not condemn the
Israelites battle against Aye / and afterward against Joshua. 8. Judges. 20.
the Beniamites? which notwithstanding / the cause which was Gods wist / and
Gods commandment justifies. And therefore in a word I answer / ye if there
be such consent amongst those which like well of this apparel / and such iarres
amongst those that like it not (as M. doctor would make the world believe)
neither is the wearing of the surplice. etc. cause of ye consent in them / nor
the not wearing cause of the disagrement in the other. But as our knowledge and
love is imperfect here in this world / so is our agreement and consent of
judgment imperfect. And yet all these hard speeches of yours / or
uncharitable suspicions of papisme / anabaptisme / catharisine / donatisme.
etc. whereby you do as much (as lies in you) to cut us clean of from you /
shall not be able so to estrange us or separate us from you / but that we will by
gods grace hold / what so ever you hold well / and keep that unity of spirit /
which is the bond of truth / eue^ with you M. doctor / whom we suppose as
appears by this your book / to have set your self further from us / then
numbers of those / which although they be content to receive the apparel / and
bear with things / yet would have been loath to have set down ye against the
sincerity of the gospel / and hinderance of reformation / which you have done.
The white apparel / which is a note and true representation of the glory and
pureness in the angels / should Act. 1. 10.
be a lying sign / and pretense of yt which is not in ye ministers / which are
miserable / and sinful men. And our savior Christ / which was the minister of
God / and pure from sin / and therefore metest to wear ye mark of pureness /
used no such kind of weed / saving only for ye small time / wherein he would
give to his disciples in the mount / a taste of that glory which he should enjoy
for ever / and they with him: where / for the time his apparel appeared as
white as snow. And if it be mete that the ministers Mark. 9. 3.
should represent the angels in their apparel / it is much more mete / that they
should have a pair of wings as the angels are described to have / to put them
in remembrance Isay. 6. 2.
of their readiness and quicknes to execute their office / which may and ought
to be in them / then to wear white apparel / which is a token of pureness from
sin and infection / and of a glory which neither they have / nor can have /
nor ought so much as to desire to have / as long as they be in this world.

And whereas the maintainers of this apparel / have for their greatest defense
/ that it is a thing mere civil: to let pass / that they confound
Ecclesiastical orders with civil (which they can no more justly do / then to
confound the church with the common wealth) I say to let that pas / they do by
this means not only make it an Ecclesiastical ceremony / but also a matter of
conscience. For if so be that the white apparel of the minister have any force
/ either to move the people / or the minister unto greater pureness / or to any
other godlynes whatsoever / then it is that which ought to be commanded / and
to be obeyed of necessity / and to be retained / although the contrary were
forbidden. And then also if there be a virtue in a white garment / and the
signification thereof be so strong to work godlynes / it were meet that order
were taken / that the whitest clothe should be bought / that it should be often
(at the least every week once) washed by a very good launder / and with soap:
for if the white help / more white helps more / and that which is most
white / helps most of all to godlynes. Although the church have authority
to make ceremonies (so they be according to the rules before recited of Gods
glory / and profiting the congregation) I could for all that never yet learn
/ that it had power to give new significations / as it were to institute new
sacraments. And by this means is taken clean away from us / the hold which
we have against the papists / whereby (against all the goodly shows which
they make by the color of these significations) we say / that the word of God
/ and the sacraments / of baptism / and of the supper of the Lord / are
sufficient to teach / to admonish / and to put us in remembrance of all
duetye whatsoever. So we are now come to the superstition of the Grecians /
for as they will have neither graven / nor carved image in their Churches / but
painted / so we will nether have graven / nor carved / nor painted / but woue^.
And truly I see no cause / why we may not have as well holy water and holy
bread / if this reason which is here / be good: for I am sure ye significations
of them are as glorious as this of the surplice / and call to remembrance as
necessary things. And if it be said / that it may not be / least the number
of ceremonies should be to too great / it may be easily answered / that these
which we have may be taken away / and those set in place of them. And therefore
although the surplice have a black spot / when it is whitest / yet is it not
so black as you make it with your white significations / nor the cause so
evil as you defend it. If you pres me with M. Martyrs / and M. Bucers
authority / I first say they were men / and therefore (although otherwise very
watchful) yet such as slept some times. And then I appeal from their
Apocryphas / unto their known wrytings / and from their private letters / unto
their public records. M. Doctor proceeds to prove that they are signs and
shows of good / and not of evil / as the authors of the admonition allege.
To the proof whereof / although (according to his manner) he repeateth diverse
things before alleged / yet the sum of all he has comprehended in an
argument / which is / that for so much as the ministers are good which wear
them / therefore they are also good: and because the ministers whereof the
apparel are notes / and marks be good: therefore those be good notes and good
marks: so the reason is they are notes / and notes of good ministers /
therefore they be good notes of the ministers. So I will prove the names of
idolles / to be fit and convenient names for good men to be called by.
Beltshaser / Shaddrake / Daniel. 1. 7.
Misacke / and Abed-nego were names of Daniell and his three companions / and
they were the names of good men / therefore they are good names of men. And so
the names of the Babylonian Idols / are by this reason of M. Doctor / justified
to be good names. Again / ye golden calfe was a sign. Also it was a sign of
the true God: therefore it was a true sign of God. Concerning the notes of
Exodus 32. 4.
civil professions / and what difference is between those and this cause / I
have spoken before.

You say the cause of discord is not in the apparel / but in the minds of
men. You mean I am sure / those that refuse the apparel / but if you make
them authors of discord / because they consent not with you in wearing / do you
not see it is as soon said / that you are the causers of discord / because
you do not consent with those which were not? for as there should be unity in
that point / if all did wear that apparel / so should there be / if all did
wear none of it. It is a very unequal comparison that you compare the use of
this apparel / with the use of wine / and of a sword / which are profitable
and necessary / but it is more intolerable / that you match it with the word
of God. I could throw it as far down / as you lift it up / but I will not
do so. This only I will say / if there were no harm in it / and that it were
also profitable / yet for as much as it is not commanded of God expressly / but
a thing (as you say) indifferent / and notwithstanding is cause of so many
incommodities / and so abused (as I have before declared) it ought to be
sufficient reason to abolish them: seeing that the brazen serpent Nom. 21. 8. 9.
2. Reg. 18. 4.
which was instituted of the Lord him self / and contained a profitable
remembrance of the wonderful benefit of God toward his people was beaten to
powder / when as it began to be an occasion of falling unto the children of
Israel: and seeing that S. Paul after the love feasts (which were kept at
the administration of the Lords supper / and were means to nourishe love
amongst 1. Cor. 11. 22.
the churches) were abused and drawn to an other use the^ they were first
ordained, did utterly take them away / and command that they should not be used
any more.

The rest of that which follows in this matter / is nothing else / but either
that which has been often times repeated / or else reprochefull words / or
unjust accusations of contempt of magistrates / without any proof at all / and
therefore are such / as either are answered / or which I will not voutchsafe to
answer / especially seeing that I mean not to give reproach for reproach /
and reuiling for reuiling: and seeing that I have before protested of our
humble submission / and loving fear or reverence / which we bear to the
Prince / and those which are appointed magistrates underneath her.

And therefore I will conclude / that for so much as the ceremonies of
Antichristianitie / are not / nor can not be / the fittest to set forth the
gospel / and for that they are occasions of fall to some / of hinderance to
other some / of grief and alienation of minds unto others (the contrary of
all which / ought to be considered in establishing of things indifferent in the
church) therefore neither is this apparel fittest for the minister of the
gospel / and if it were / yet considering the incommodities that come of the
use of it / it should be removed.

YOu know they allow studying for sermones / and amplifying and expou^ding of
the scriptures / and why then do you ask? But by this question you would have
your reader think / or at the least have the authors of the Admonition in
suspicion / that they liked not of study for sermones. God make us more
careful of the good name of our brethren / then by such light and ungrounded
suspicions / nay without any suspicion / nay contrary to that which is daily
seen and hard / to raise up such slanderous reports of them. But Homilies
are smally beholding unto you / which to prove that they may be red in the
church / allege that Augustine and Chrysostom made sermones in their
churches: for that which we call a sermon / they called of the Greek word an
Homily / so that the argument is / that Augustine and Chrysostom preached
sermons / or Homilies in their churches / therefore we may read homilies in
ours. But peradventure you have some better thing to say for them afterward.

77. pages.
OF these offices some thing has been spoken before / where it has been
proved out of the words of Christ / that neither the names / nor offices of
Archbishop / or Archdeacons do agree to the ministry of the gospel. Now as
M. Doctor bestows great cost here / and travail in digging about them / and
laying (as it were) new earth to their roots / that they being half dead /
if it were possible / might be recovered and quickened again / so I (because
these trees mount up so high / and spread their boughs and arms so broad /
that for the cold shade of them nothing can grow / and thrive by them) will
before I come to answer these things that are here alleged / set down
certain reasons (as it were instruments) to take away the superfluous loppe
and spread of these immoderate offices.

And for the names first / I desire the reader that we be not thought studious
of contention / because we strive about the name of Archbishop. etc. for this
is not to strive about words / unless it be counted a strife of words / which
is taken for the maintenance of the word of God / as it has before appeared
out of the Evangelists. Then it must be remembered which Aristotle says very
well in his Elenches / that ta onomata ton pragmaton mimemata esti: which is /
that names are imitations / or as it were expres images of the things whereof
they are names / and do for the most part bring to him that hears them /
knowledge of the things that are signified by them. Howsoever the thing be it
self / yet oftentimes it is supposed to be as the name pretends / and
thereupon follows / that a man may be easily deceived / when the names do
not answer to the things whereof they are names. There may be / I grant / a
freer and more licentious use of names / but that license is more tolerable in
any thing / rather then in matters of the church and salvation. And if there be
some cases / wherein names that are not so proper / may be borne with / yet are
there also which are intolerable. As who can abide that a minister of the
gospel / should be called by the name of a Leuite / or sacrificer / onles it
be he which would not care much / if the remembrance of the death / and
resurrection of our savior Christ were plucked out of his mind? Again / it
is unlawful for any man to take upon him those titles which are proper to our
savior Christ: but the title of Archbishop is only proper to our savior
Christ / therefore no man may take that unto him. That it 1. Epist. 5. 4. Heb.
13. 20. Acts. 3. 15. Acts. 5. 31. Heb. 12. 2.
is proper to our savior Christ / appears by that which S. Peter says /
where he calls him archipoimena: which is archshepheard or archbishop / for
bishop and shepherd are all one. And in the Hebrews where he is called the
great shepherd of the sheep / and in the Acts / and * Hebrews / archleader
of life and of salvation / which titles are never found to be given unto any /
but unto our savior Christ / and are proper titles of his mediation / and
therefore can not be without bold presumption applied unto any mortal man.

And it any man will reply and say / that it is not said that our savior Christ
is only archbishop. I answer that he is not only said the head / and yet
notwithstanding there is no more heads of the church but he. And if it be
further said that these archbyshops are but under / and as it were subordinate
archbyshops / I say that a man may as well say that men may be also under heads
of ye church / which is the same which is alleged for the pope. Which thing is
not only true in those words which do signify / and set unlawful things
before our eyes / but even in those names also which having no corruption in
their own nature / yet through the corrupt use of men / have as it were
gotten such a tacke of that corruption / that the use of them can not be
without offense.

In the primitive church / the name of a Pope was honest / and was all one
Tertull lib. de pudicitia. Cypr. lib. 2. Epist. 7. Jerome in his Epistles to
Augustine.
with the name of a good pastor / but now by the ambition of the man of Rome /
it is so defiled / that every good man shakes at the very mention of it.

The name of a Tyranne / was first honorable / and the same with a king / and
yet through cruelty / and unjust rule of certain / it is become now so
hateful / that no upright and just dealing Prince / none that governs with
equitye / and to the commodity of his subjects / would bear to be called
Tyranne: whereby it may appear / that it is not for naught that we do stand of
these names. Now if the names ought to be odious / being both horribly abused
/ and also forbidden by our savior Christ / the things them selves must be
in greater hatred / the unlawfulness whereof may thus appear.

First of all / the ministry is by the word of God / and heavenly / and not
left to the will of men to devise at their pleasure / as appears by that
which is noted of s. John / where the Phariseis coming to s. John Baptist /
after that he had denied to be either Christ / or Elias / or another Prophet /
conclude / if you be neither John. 1. 25.
Christ / nor Elias / nor of the Prophets / why baptisest thou? which had been
no good argument / if s. John might have been of some other function / then of
those which were ordinary in the church / and instituted of God. And
therefore S. John to establish his singular and extraordinary function /
alleges the word of God / whereby appears / that as it was not lawful to
bring in any strange doctrine / so was it not lawful to teach the true
doctrine / under the name of any other function then was instituted by God.

Let the whole practice of the church under the law / be looked upon / and it
shall not be found that any other Ecclesiastical ministry was appointed /
then those orders of high priest / and priests / and Levites. etc. which were
appointed by the law of God / and if there were any raised extraordinarily /
the same had their calling confirmed from heaven / either by signs or miracles
/ or by plain and clear testimonies of the mouth of God / or by
extraordinarye exciting and mouings of the spirit of God. So that it appears
that the ministry of the gospel / and the functions thereof / ought to be
from heaven / and of God / and not invented by the brain of men: from heaven /
I say / and heavenly / because although it be executed by earthly men / and
the ministers also are chosen by men like unto themselves / yet because it is
done by the word and institution of God / that has not only ordained that the
word should be preached / but has ordained also in what order / and by whom
it should be preached / it may well be accounted to come from heaven / and from
God.

Seeing therefore / that these functions of the Archbishop and Archdeacon are
not in the word of God / it follows that they are of the earth / and so can do
no good / but much harm in the church. And if any man will say ye we do the
church great iniurye / because we do tie her to a certain number of orders of
ministers / as it were to a stake / so that she may not devise new functions /
I say that both the church and Christ does accuse him again. Christ estemeth
him self to have injury / because that by this means he is imagined not to
have been careful / and provident enough for his church / in that he has left
the ministry / wherein does consist the life of the church (being that whereby
it is begotten) so raw and imperfect / yt by permitting of it to the ordering
of men / there is a great danger of error / which he might have set without all
danger / by a word or two speaking.

The church of the other side rises against him / for that he makes Christ
les careful for her / then he was for that under the law. For tell me in the
whole volume of the Testament is there any kind or degree of ministry /
whereof God is not the certain and expres author? was there ever any man (I
except Jeroboam and such profane men) either so holy / or so wise / or of
such great knowledge / that ever did so much as dream of instituting of a
new ministry? After the long wandering of the Arc in the wilderness / when
it came to be placed in Jerusalem / tell me if any besides the Levites and
Priests / the ordinary ministers / and the Prophets which were immediately
stirred up of God / were found to have ordained any office or title / which was
not commanded / or whether there was at any time any thing added / or enjoined
to those offices of priesthode and Leuiteship / which was not by the law
prescribed.

All men know that the Arc of Noah / was a figure of the church. Noah Genesis 6.
14. 22.
was both a wise and a godly man / yet what does the Lord leave to his wisdom /
when as he appoynteth the matter / the form / the length / the breadth / the
height / the wood / the kind and sort of wood.

In the tabernacle the church is yet more expressedly showed forth / Moses that
was the ouerseer of the work / was a wise and a godly man / the artificers
Exodus 26. Exodus 31. 3. 6.
that wroughte it / Bezalael / and Aholiab / most cunning workmen / and yet
observe / how the Lord leaves nothing to their will / but tells not only
of the boordes / of the curtains / of the apparel / but also of the bars /
of the rings / of the strings / of the hooks / of the besomes / of the
snuffers / and of the things / Exo. 39. 42.
the matter / and the form.

Let us come to the temple / which as it was more near the time of Christ / so
it does more lively expres the church of God / which now is. Solomon the
wisest man that ever was or shall be / does nothing in it / neither for the
temple 1. Reg. 3. 12. 1. Chro. 28. 11. etc. 19. 1. Reg. 6. 2. Chro. 3. 4. 5.
Ezech. 40.
nor for the vessels of the temple / nor for the beauty of it / but
according to the form that was enjoined him / as appears in the Kings / and
Chronicles. And in the restoring of that temple / Ezechiel is witness / how the
Angel by the commandment of God does part by part / appoint all to be done
both in the temple and in the furniture thereof.

Now if the holy ghost in Figures and Tropes does so carefully / and as a
man may speak / curiously comprehend all things: in the truth it self /
how much more is it to be thought that he has performed this? If in the
shadows / how much more in the body / if he have done this in earthly things
/ and which are pearished / how is it to be thought that he has not performed
it in heavenly / and those which abide for ever? And then tell me what are
those times / of which it was said / the Messiah when he comes / will tell us
all? Is it a like thing John. 4. 25.
that he which did not only appoint the temple and the tabernacle / but the
ornaments of them / would not only neglecte the ornaments of the church /
but also that / without the which (as we are borne in hand) it can not long
stand? shall we think that he which remembered the bars there / has
forgotten the pillars here? or he that there remembered the pinnes / did here
forget the master builders? should he there remember the besomes / and here
forget Archbyshops / if any had been needful? there make mention of the
snuffers to purge the lights / and here pass by the lights them selves? And
to conclude / that he should make mention there of the moates / and here say
nothing of the beams? there reckon up the gnattes / here keep silence of the
Camels? what is this else / but that which Aristotle says / ta mikra horan kai
ta megala paroran: that is / to look to small things / and not to look to
great / which if it can not fall into the Lord / let it be a shame to say that
the chief pillar and vpholder of the church / is not expressed in the
scripture / nor can not be concluded of it.

Moreover those ministeries without the which the church is fully builded /
and brought to perfection and complete unity / are not to be retained in the
church: but with out the ministeries of Archbishop. etc. the church may be
fully builded and brought to perfection / therefore these ministeries are not
to be retained.

And that without these ministeries the Church may be complete / it appears
by that which is in the Ephesians / where it is said / that Christ gave 4.
Ephesians. 11. 12.
some Apostles / some Prophets / some Evangelists / some pastors and Doctors
/ to the restoring of the saints unto the work of the ministry / until we
all come to the unity of faith / and of the knowledge of the son of God /
and unto a perfect man.

The learned writers have thus reasoned against the Pope: that for so much as
Apostles / Prophets. etc. are sufficient for the building of the church /
therefore there ought to be no Pope. The argument and necessity of the
conclusion is as strong against the Archbishop / and all one. For by the same
reason that the Pope is cast away as a superfluous thing / for that these
offices are able to make perfect the Church / is the Archbishop likewise
thrown out of the Church / as a knobbe or some lump of flesh / which being
no member of the body / does both burden it and disfigure it. And as they say
that God gave no Pope to his church / therefore the Pope can do no good / so
we may well say / God gave no Archbishop to his church / therefore the
Archbishop can do no good.

Neither did God give any archdeacon to his church / therefore he can not
profit the church. But it will be said that this argument follows not /
because no mention is made here of the deacon or of the elder / which
notwithstanding are both necessary in the church / and therefore that there
are functions profitable in the church / whereof no mention is made here. But
how easily do all men know / that the Apostle speaks of those functions
here only / which are conversant in the word / and have to do with the
preaching thereof: and therefore made here no mention of the deacon or elder.
It is said again / that in the Epistle to the Corinth. S. Paul speaks only
of Apostles / Prophets / and 1. Cor. 12. 28.
Doctors / leaving out Evangelists and pastors / and yet Evangelists and
pastors necessary / and so although archbishops are not spoken of in the place
to the Ephesians / yet they may not be therefore shut out as unnecessary. But
they that say so / should have considered that the diversity of the matter
which the Apostle handles in these two places / bred a diverse kind of speech.
For in the Epistle to the Corinthians / going about to condemn the ambition
of men / which will thrust them selves into other men's callings / and take upon
them to do all them selves / and to be as it were / eye / and ear / and hand
and all. S. Paul proves that the church is a body / wherein there are many
members / and the same diverse one from an other / and that it is not one member
only. And to prove that / it was sufficient to say that he placed some Apostles
/ some Prophets / some Doctors / without rehearsing all the kinds of
functions. But in the Epistle to the Ephesians / meaning to show the
liberality of our savior Christ in giving those / which should be able by
doctrine and teaching to make perfect and absolute his church / it was
necessary that he should reckon up all those functions / whereby that work is
done.

But how comes it to pass that S. Paul neither in the one place / neither
in the other / nor else where / makes mention of the archbishop / which is
said to be the cheifest pillar and under setter of the church? Now I hear what
is said to this: that under the pastor is contained bishop / he is not
contained / but is the same that pastor. How then? forsooth say they an
archbishop is bishop / well then / of bishops some are archbyshops / and some
are what? Here I see that they are hanged in ye bush / but I will help them.
Of bishops some are archbyshops / some are by the common name bishops: For if
they answer not thus / what have they to say? But what an absurd thing were
that / to say that S. Paul comprehended an archbishop under a pastor or bishop
/ which neither was at that time / nor certain hundredth years after? this
were not to divide / but to prophecy. And how is it that they never marked
that S. Paul speaks of those functions which were in the church / and not of
those which should be afterward? and of those that God had given / and not of
those which he would give? for the words are / (and he has given.)

Moreover if so be under the pastor / the apostle comprehended an archbishop /
then the archbishop is necessary / and such as the church can not be without /
and commanded of God / and therefore not taken up by the policy of the
church for the time and country / and other circumstances / and such also as
can not be put down at the will of the church / which is contrary to the
judgment of those / which are the archbyshops patrones. The last refuge is /
that the Apostle made mention of those functions / which have to do with the
ministering of the word and sacraments / and not of those which have to do with
order and discipline.

Speak in good earnest / had the Apostles nothing to do with discipline and
order? with what face can you take away the raines of government out of the
Apostles hands / and put them in the Archbyshops and Archdeacons hands? what a
perverseness is this / that the ministeries invented by men / should be
preferred to all the ministeries appointed and commanded of God.

The Apostles forsooth have in common with the Archbyshops and Archdeacons the
power of ministering of the word and of the sacraments / of binding and losyng
/ and thus far as good as the Archbyshops and Archdeacons: But for disciplyne
and order / the Apostles have nothing to do / but herein Archbyshops and
Archdeacons are above them / and better then they.

Now sir / if I would follow your vain of making so many exclamations / as Oh
the impudency / Oh the insolency / with twenty other such great Ohs / you
see I have occasion both here and else where / but I would not gladly declame
/ especially when I should dispute / nor make outcries in stead of reasons.

But to come to this distinction: I had thought before this time / that the
apostles had been ye * chief builders in setting up ye church: now I perceive
you 1. Cor. 3. 10.
make the archbyshops and archdeacons the chief builders / and the apostles
under carpenters / or common masons / to serve and to take the commandment of
the archbishop and archdeacon. And whereas it is said / that the ministers which
S. Paul speaks of / are in the word and sacraments / binding and loosing
only / and that there be other which are besides these / occupied in the order
and disciplyne of the church (of which number are archbyshops and archdeacons)
let us mark a little what deep divinity here is.

And first of all / I would gladly ask them / with what advise they have laid
on a greater burden and weight of the archbishops and archdeacons shoulders /
then the apostles were able to sustain?

Secondarily / I ask with what boldness / and upon the confidence of what
gifts / any man dare take upon him both that which the apostles did / and
more too? Then I say that it is too too unskillfully done / to separate order /
and discipline from them that have the ministry of the word in hand / as
though ye church without archbyshops and archdeacons / were a confused heap /
and a disordered lump / when as S. Paul teaches it to be without them / a
body consisting of Romans 12. 4. 5.
all his parts and members / comely knitte and joined together / wherein
nothing wants / nor nothing is too much. Does it not pertayne to order / that
the apostle says / that God has set first apostles / secondly prophets /
thirdly teachers? 1. Cor. 12. 28. Collos. 2. 19.
are not these words (first / second / third / differences of order? if this
be not order / surely I know not what order is. And yet neither archbishop nor
archdeacon author of this / and it was kept also before they were hatched.

Let us see of disciplyne and government / which we may see to be committed to
those / which have the preaching of the word / and to others also which did not
preach the word / when S. Paul says that the elders which govern well / 1.
Tim. 5. 17.
are worthy double honor / especially those which travail in the word. Where
he appoynteth the government to the ministers of the word / and to those also
that were not ministers of the word. And thereupon it follows / that the
ministers of the church are not severed one from an other / as you sever them /
because some have the ministration of the word and sacraments only / and some
with the administration of the sacraments and word / have also the government
and disciplyne in their hands / but clean contrariwise S. Paul
distinguishes them / and shows that all ye ministers in the church have the
gouermnent / but all have not the word to handle / so that he distinguishes
the ministry into that / which is occupied in the word and government / and
into that which is occupied in the government only. But in this distinction you
do not only forget S. Paul / but you forget your self. For if S. Paul speak
in that place of those that meddle with the ministering of the word and
sacraments only: why does the bishop which is one of the ministers that S.
Paul speaks of (being the same that pastor is) why I say does he meddle with
the discipline and order of the church / seeing that belongs not to him by
your distinction? why does also the archbishop (whom you say is a bishop)
meddle with it? and thus you see you need no other adversary then your self /
to confute you.

And least any man should say I confute mine own shadow / I must let him
understand that there is a pamphlet in Latin / which is called the book of
the doctors / which goes from hand to hand / and especially (so far as
they could bring to pass) to those only that they thought to favor that
opynion / in the which book / all these answers unto the place of the
Ephesians are contained / and almost all that which is comprehended in this
defense of archbishops and archdeacons / with other things also which are
found in this book of M. Doctors: and therefore it is very likely / that he
having no other way to vente his rapsodies and rakings together / thought he
would bring them to light after this sort / but how much better had it been /
that this myshapen thing had had the mothers womb for the grave / or being
brought out / had been hidden as the former is / in some bench hole or dark
place / where it should never have seen any light / nor no man's eye should
ever have looked of it? And thus all these clouds being scattered by the sun
of truth / you see that the place to the Ephesians / stands strong against
the archbishop and archdeacon.

Now will I reason also after this sort out of the place of the Ephesians and
Corinthyans joined together. There is no function but has gifts fit and
apt to discharge it / annexed and given unto it: whereupon the Apostle by a
Metonomy / does call the Apostles / Prophets. etc. gifts / because they have
always gifts joined with them. This being granted (as no man can deny it) I
reason thus.

Those functions only are suffycient for the church / which have all the gifts
needful / either for the mynistring of the word and sacraments / or for the
government of the church: but all these functions reckened of S. Paul to the
Ephesians / with those which S. Paul calls antilepseis, and kyberneseis
Ephe. 4. 11. 1. Cor. 12. 28.
(which are ye deacons and elders) have the gifts needeful / either for the
government of the church / either else for the ministering of the word and
sacraments: therefore these functions only are sufficient for the church / for
it is a superfluous thing to make more offices / then there be gifts to
furnish them / for so they that should have them / should rather be idols
then officers. And therefore for as much as there is no gift which falls not
into some of these functions / it is altogether a vain and unprofitable thing
/ to bring more offices and functions into the church besides these.

And so it may be thus reasoned. If men may make and erect new ministeries /
they must either give gifts for to discharge them / or assure men that they
shall have gifts of God / whereby they may be able to answer them. But they
can neither give gifts / nor assure men of any gifts necessary to discharge
those functions / therefore they may make or erect no new ministeries.

Last of all / I conclude against these made and devised ministeries of
archbishops and archdeacons after this sort. If men may add ministeries / they
may also take away / for those both belong to one authority: but they can not
take away those ministeries that God has placed in his church / therefore they
can not add to those that are placed in the church. And this foundation I
thought first to lay / or ever I entered into M. Doctors not reasons / but
authorities / not of God / but of men / in confuting of which / there will fall
forth also other arguments against both these offices of archbishop / and
archdeacon.

Now I will come to the examining of your witnesses / whereof some of them are
so bored in the ears / and branded in their foreheades / that no man need to
fear any credit they shall get before any judge wheresoever / or before
whomsoever they come / but in the Romish court / and the papists only
excepted. For to let go Polidore Virgil / because whatsoever he says / he
says of the credit of another / let us come to Clement which is the author
of this you speak. And what is he? is there any so blind that knows not
that this was nothing less then Clement / of whom S. Paul speaks / and
which * some think was the 4. Phil. 3. Tert. de prescrip. aduersus heret.
first bishop of Rome ordained by Peter / and not rather a wicked helhounde /
into whom the Lord had sent satan to be a lying spirit in his mouth / to
deceive them for their unthankful receiving of the gospel? And he must
witness for the archbishop: a worthy witness. For as all that popish
hierarchy came out of the bottomless pit of hell / so to uphold the
archbishop the neck of it / whereupon that Romish monster stands / are
raised up from hell bastardes / Clemens and Anacletus / and in deed as it may
appear / the very natural sons of Satan / and the sworn soldiers of
Antichrist.

A man would have thought / that the bishop of Salisburie master Iuell / had so
pulled of the painting of the face of this Clement / that all good men would
have had him in detestation / so far of would they have been to have alleged
out of him to prove any thing that is in controversy.

The bishop alleges both Eusebius and S. Jerome to prove / that none In the
reply to M. Harding fol. 7.
of those works which go in his name / are his. And although the proufes be
strong which the bishop uses / being the witness of unsuspected witnesses: yet
because ye law / although it allow two witnesses / notwithstanding does like
better of three / I will set down here also Ireneus which was a great while
before them both / and followed hard after the times of the true and
vncounterfaite Clement / and therefore could best tell of him / and of his
writings / and yet * he makes Lib. 3. c. 3.
mention but of one Epistle / which upon occasion amongst the Corinthians / he
wrote to them. In deed in another place of that book / he shows that it is
very probable / that Clement also either wrote or turned the Epistle to the
Hebrews. Now if that Epistle to the Corinthes / were extante / we should
easily set by comparing those that are now in his name with that / what a my
shapen thing this is.

And if so be that Ireneus conjecture be good / that Clement was the author or
interpreter of the Epistle to the Hebrews / then what horrible injury is done
to the holy ghost / while the same is supposed the writer of this book to the
Hebrews / which is the author of such beggary / as this Clement brought into
the world? And I pray you / do you hold that it is the true christyan
relygion / which that book contains? Could none of these consyderations
drive you from the testimony of this Clement? it goes very hard with the
archbishop / when these Clementes and Anacletusses / must be brought to
underprop him.

But what if there be no such book as this is / which you name (when you say
in his book entitled / compendiariu^ religionis christianae) it is like you
know not him / nor what he says / when you can not tell so much as his name.
Only because Polidore writes that Clement says this / in a certain short and
summary book of christian relygion / you have set down that he writes thus
in a book entitled compendiarium christianae religionis / where there is no
such title / neither in the councels where his Epistles are / neither yet in
all other his works.

Thought you to disguise him with this new name of the book / that he should
not be known? ^or meant you to occupy your answerer in seeking of a book /
which because he should never find / he should never answer. The place which
Polidore means / is in the first epistle which he writes unto James / the
brother of the Lord / which is as the rest are both rediculous in the manner of
writing / and in the matter oftener times wicked and blasphemous / which I
speak to this end / that the reader through the commendation that M. Doctor
has given to this Clement / in taking him as one of his witnesses in so great
a matter / be not abused.

For answer unto him / although he be not worth the answering / I say that
first it may be well said here of the office of the Archbishop / that the
father of it was an Amorite / and mother a Hittite / that is / that it comes
of very infamous parentage / the beginning thereof being of the idolatrous
nations.

And whereas Clement makes S. Peter the Apostle to make it as it were his
adopted son / thereby to wipe away the shame of his birth / it does S. Peter
shameful injury. For besides that it was far from S. Peter / to take this
authority to him self / not only of making archbyshops through out every
province / but also instituting a new order or office / without the council of
the rest of the apostles / which none else of the apostles did / and which is
contrary to the practice of S. Peter / both in the first and sixth of the Acts
/ contrary also to the practices of the apostles / which after shall appear: I
say besides this / is it like that S Peter would grass the noblest plant (as
it is said) of the mynisterie of the gospel / in such a rotten stock of that
which was most abominable in all idolarrie? for the greater they were in the
service of the idolles / the more detestable were they before God.

The Lord / when he would geuelawes of worshipping / unto his people / Leuit.
19. 27. Deu. 22. 11. 12 Leuit. 11.
in the things that were indifferent / of shauing and cutting / and apparel
wearing / says to his people / that they should not do so / and so / because
the Gentiles did so / yea even in those things / the use whereof was otherwise
very profitable / and incommodious to forbear / he would have the^
notwithstanding to abstain from / as from swines flesh / conneys. etc. to the
end that he might have them severed / Deuteronomy. 14. Ephe. 2. 14.
as appears in S. Paul / by a great and high wall from other nations.

And therefore it is very unlike that S. Peter would frame the ministry of
the gospel (which is no ceremony / but of the substance of the gospel) by
the example of the heathenish / and idolatrous functions.

If one had said / that the Lord had shapen his common wealth / by the pattern
of other common wealths / although it had been most untrue (all other
flourishing common wealths of Athens / Lacedemon / and Rome / borowing their
good laws of the Lords common wealth) yet had it been more tolerable: but to
say he framed the ministry of the gospel / by the priesthode of idolatry /
is to fetch chastity out of Sodom / and to seek for heaven in hell.

And if so be that the Lord had delighted in this hierarchy / he would rather
have taken of his own / then borrowed of others / of his own church / then of
the sinagogue of Satan. For under ye law besides the Levites / there were
priests / and above them a high priest.

And to say that Peter appointed archbyshoppes and bishops / by the example
of the idolaters / is after a sort to make the law to come out of Egypt or
Babylon / and not out of Sion or Jerusalem / as the Prophet says. You say
Esaias. 2. 3.
after that / James was an archbishop: if he were / he was the first / and
placed over the Jews.

And although S. Peter might to gain the Gentiles / he content to use their
idolatrous functions / with a little change of their names / yet there is none
so mad / to think that he would translate any such function from the Gentiles
unto the Jews / which were never before accustomed with any such Flamines / or
Archiflamines. And this I dare generally and at once say against you and your
Clement / that the Lord translated diverse things out of the Law / into the
Gospel 5. Math. 22. 9. John. 22.
/ as the Presbytery or eldershyp / excommunication / and the office of Deacons
(as it is thought) for that the Saduces / of whom so often mention is made in
the gospel / are thought to have had that office to provide for the poor /
for those that know the Hebrew tongue / do understand that tsaddikim and
tsedacah, do not only signify justice and just men / but also alms and alms
men: I say these and others more translated from the law unto the gospel / but
neither you nor your Clement / shall ever be able to show / that the Lord ever
translated any thing from Gentelisme into the gospel.

We read in the Acts / that all the Gentiles were commanded to conform Act.
15. 29.
them selves unto the Jews in the abstayning from blood and strangled meat
for a time / but we can never find that the Jews were commanded to conform
them to the Gentiles in their ceremonies / the reason whereof is / because the
one was sometimes the law of God / and therefore he that had conscience in it /
was to be borne with / and the other came from men / and out of their forge /
which the Lord would never give so much honor unto / as to make other men by
any means subject unto them.

But what if there were no such offices amongst the Gentiles and Paganes / as
Archiflamines / or Protoflamines? whereof before I show the conjectures which I
have / I must give the (gentle reader) to understand / that I am not ignorant
that there are diverse which say there were such offices amongst the Gentiles /
and namely here in England / that there were. 25. Flamines / and three
Archiflamines / whereof were made three archbyshops / of London / Canterbury /
and York / and. 25. Bishops / as Platine has in the chapter Eleutherius: And
Galfridus Monemutensis in his second book and first chapter. And Lumbarde in
his fourth book speaks of it / as of a general thing that was in all
places where Paganism was. But if so be that the relygion of other Paganes did
follow / and was like unto that of the Romans (which is very probable) they
being then the rulers of the whole world in a manner / unto whose example all
men do lightly conform them selves / even without commandment / then there
is great likelyhoode / there were no such archiflamines / or protoflamines out
of Tullie / which shows that there was amongst the Romans diverse kinds of
priests / whereof some were called flamines / of a several attire which they
ware always of their heads / other pontifices, and a thir^^^ sort were called
Salij, and that the chief of these Flamines / was called fl^me^ ^^al^s, who
was also distinguished from the rest / up a white hatte / but of any
archiflamines / or protoflamines / he makes no mention at all / and therefore
it is like that there was never any such office amongst the Paganes.

And if there were / I have showed how wicked it is to say that Peter framed
the mynisterie of the gospel by it. Now let it be seen of all men / how
strongly you have concluded / that the names of archbyshoppes are not
antichristian / when as it is most certain / that he was a pillar of antichrist
/ upon whom your reason is grounded.

The times wherein Volusianus lived / declare suffyciently how little credit
is to be given to his testimony / which were when the mass had place / if not
so wicked as it was after / yet notwithstanding far differing from the
simplicity of the supper which was left by our savior Christ. And Eusebius is
of more Eus. 3. Lib. 4. Eus. 4. Lib. 23.
credit in this then Volusianus / which says of the report of Dionisius
bishop of Corinthe / that S. Paul made Dionisius Areopagita bishop of Athens:
he says not archbishop / but bishop / although he speak twice of it. And in
the preface before his works / it is fayde / that after his conversion / he
went to Rome to Clement / and was sent with others of Clement / into the West
parts / and that he came to Paris / and was there executed / whether so ever
of these opinions is true / that falls which Volusianus affirms. And if
either Volusianus or you / will have us beeleue that Dyonisius Areopagita was
archbyshoppe of Athens / you must show some better authority then Eusebius or
Dyonisius bishop of Corinthe / and then your cause shall have at the least some
more color of truth.

Erasmus follows / which says Titus was archbishop of Crete / whom I could
answer with his own words / for I am sure he will grant me / that Titus and
Timothe had one office / the one in Ephesus / the other in Crete: but it
appears by Erasmus his own words / that Timothe was but bishop of Ephesus /
therefore Titus was but bishop of Crete. For Erasmus in his argument upon the
first Epistle of Timothe / says that S. Paul did enfornie Timothe of the
office of a bishop / and of the discipline of the church: If either he had been
an archbishop / or an archbishop had been so necessary as it is made / he
would have instructed him in that also.

And I pray you tell me / whether Erasmus or the Greek Scholiast / be more to
be beeleeued in this point / out of whom is taken that which is in the
latter end of the Epystles to Tymothe and Tytus / where they both are called
the first elected Bishops that ever were / either of Ephesus or Creta. For my
part I thyncke they were neither Bishops nor Archbyshoppes / but
Evangelists / as shall appear afterward: But it may be suffycient to have
set against Erasmus authority / the authority of the Scholiaste. And if
here you will cavil and say that the Scholiaste which says he was Bishop
/ denies not but that he also was an Archbyshoppe / because an archbishop is a
bishop / it may be answered casely / that the Scholiaste did not speak nor
write so improperly / as to call them by the general name of bishop / whom he
might as easily have called (if the truth would have let him) by a more proper
and particular name of archbishop. And further in this dyuision of the
mynisters / the archbishop and the bishop are members of one dyuision / and
therefore one of them can not be affirmed and said of an other / for that were
contrary to the nature of a true dyuision.

And yet I have a further answer / both to Erasmus and Volusianus / and
whatsoever other have written after this sort / that they speak and gave
titles to those men they wrote of / not according to that which they were / but
according to the custom and manner of that age wherein they wrote. And so we
may read vincen. 10. lib. c. 124. Nice. 4. li. ca. 38.
that Vincentius and Nicephorus writing of Victor / speak far otherwise of
him / then Eusebius does / which notwithstanding wrote of the same man which
they did. The one calls Victor the Pope of Rome. And the other says / that
in glory he passed all the bishops before him / which Eusebius never makes any
word of. Even so Volusianus and Erasmus / living in the times when as they
which were the most esteemed in the ministry / were called archbyshops / call
Titus and Dyonisius archbyshops / upon whom depended the chief care of those
churches which they governed.

There follows Anacletus / an other of these witnesses / which must depose
that the name of an archbishop is not antychristian / of whom / as of Clement
that went before / and Anicetus which follows after / the common proverb may
be verifyed / Ask my fellow if I be a thief. And although the answerer be
ashamed of him / and says therefore he will omit him / yet even very need
dryueth him / to bring him in / and to make him speak the uttermost he can.
And this honest man says / that James was the first archbishop of Jerusalem.
But Eusebius says / James was bishop / not archbishop of Jerusalem / and
appointed by the apostles. And in an other place / he says / that the apostles
did appoint after his death / Simeon the son of Cleophas / bishop of
Jerusalem. And Ireneus says / that the apostles in all places appointed
bishops 2. Lib. 23. cap. 3. Lib. 22,
unto the churches / whereby it may appear what an idle dream it is of
Clement / Volusianus / and Anacletus / either that Peter did this by his own
authority / or that the primitive church was ever staynes with these
ambytious 4. Lib. 63.
tytles of patriarche / prymate / metropolytane / or archbyshoppe / when as the
stories make mention / that thoroughe out every church / not chery province /
not by Peter or Paul / but by apostles / a bishop / not an archbishop / was
appointed.

And here you put me in remembrance of an other argument against the
archbishop / which I will frame after this sort. If there should be any
archbishop many place / the same should be either in respect of the person or
minister and his excellency / or in respect of the magnificence of the place:
but the most excellent mynisters that ever were / in the most famous places /
were no archbyshops / but bishops only / therefore there is no cause why there
should be any archbishop. For if there were ever mynister of a congregation
worthy / that was James / if there were ever any citte that ought to have this
honor / as that the mynister of it should have a more honorable title / then
the mynisters of other cities and towns / that was Jerusalem / where the son
of God preached / and from whence the gospel issued out unto all places. And
afterward that Jerusalem decayed / and the church there / Antioche was a place
where the notablest men were that ever have been since / which also deserved
great honor / for that there the * disciples were first called christians /
but neither was that called the Act. 11. 26.
first and cheifest church / neither the mynisters of it called the Arche or
principal bishops. And Eusebius to declare that this order was firm and
durable / Eus. 3. 23.
shows that S. John the Apostle / which over lived the residue of the
Apostles / ordained bishops in every church.

These two / Anacletus and Anicetus / you say / are suspected / why do you say
suspected / when as they have been convinced and condemned / and stand upon
the pillery / with the cause of forgerie written in great letters / that he
which runs may read? Some of the papists them selves / have suspected them
/ but those which maintain the truth have condemned them as full of popery /
full of blasphemy / and as those in whom was the very spirit of contradiction
to the Apostles and their doctrine.

And do you mark what you say / when you say that these are but suspected?
Thus much you say / that it is suspected / or in doubt / whether the whole body
of popery and antichristianitie were in the Apostles time / or sone after or
no / for Clement was in the Apostles time / and their scholar / and so you
leave it in dout, whether the apostles appointed and were the authors of popery
or no. I think if ever you had red the Epistles / you would never have cited
their authorities / nor have spoken so favorably of them as you do.

You come after to the council of Nice / wherein I will not stick with you /
that you say it was holden the.CCC. xxx. year of the Lord / when as it may
appear by Eusebius his Computation / that it was holden. Anno Domini CCC xx.
and here you take so great a leap / that it is enoughe to break the
archbishoppes neck / to skippe at once.CCC. years / (that is / from the time
of the apostles / until the time of the council of Nice) without any
testimony of any / either father / or story of faith and credit / which
makes once mention of an archbishop. What no mention of him in Theophilus /
bishop of Antioche? none in Ignatius? none in Clemens Alexandrinus / none in
Justin Martyr / in Ireneus / in Tertullian / in Origin / in Cyprian / none in
all those old Historiographers / out of the which Eusebius gathers his
story? Was it for his baseness and smalnes / that he could not be seen amongst
the bishops / elders / and deacons / being the chief and principal of them
all? can the Ceder of Lebanon be hid amongst the box trees? Aristotle in his
Rhethorike ad Theodecten, says / that it is a token of contempt / to forget
the name of an other / belike therefore if there were any archbishop / he had
no chair in the church / but was as it seems / digging at the metalles. For
otherwise they that have filled their books with the often mentioning of
bishops / would have no doubt remembered him. But let us hear what the council
of Nice has for these titles.

In the. 6. canon mention is made of a metropolitan bishop: what is that to
the metropolitan which is now / either to the name / or to the office? of the
office it shall appear afterward. In the name I think there is a great
difference / between a metropolitan bishop / and metropolitan of England / or
of al England. A Metropolitan bishop was nothing else / but a bishop of that
place / which it pleased the Emperor or magistrate to make the chief city of
the diocese or shire / and as for this name / it makes no more difference
between bishop and bishop / then when I say a minister of London / and a
minister of Nuington. There is no man that is well advised / which will gather
of this saying / that there is as great difference in pre-eminence between
those two ministers / as is between London / and Nuington: for his office and
pre-eminence / we shall see hereafter.

There are alleged to prove the names of archbyshops / patriarchs /
archdeacons / the. 13. 25. 26. and. 27. Canons of the council of Nece. For the.
25. 26. 27. there are no such canons of that council: and although there be a
thirtenthe canon / there is no word of patriarch / or archdeacon / there
contained. And I marvel with what shame you can thruste upon us these
counterfaite canons which come out of the popes minte / yea / and which are not
to be found. Theodoret says / that there are but twenty Canons of the
council of Niece / and 1. Lib. 8. cap.
those twenty are in the tome of the councels / and in those there is no
mention of any patriarch / archdeacon / archbishop. Ruffine also remembers.
22. Canons / 1. lib. 6. ca.
very little differing from those other twenty / but in length / and in none
of those are found any of these names of archbishop / archdeacon / patriarch.
And it is as lawful for M. Harding to allege the. 44. canon of the counsel
of Nece / to prove the supremacy of the Pope of Rome / as it is for M. doctor
Whitgift / to allege the. 25. 26. 27. to prove the name of archbishop /
archdeacon / patriarch: for they are all of one stamp / and have like
authority.

I fear greatly / some craftye dissembling papist had his hand in this book /
who having a great deal of rotten stuff / which he could not utter under his
own name (being already lost) brought it unto the author hereof / which has
upon his credit without further examination / set it to sale. Peradventure you
will think scorn to be censured and reprehended of a poor minister of the
country / and therefore I will turn you over for your lesson in this behalf /
unto the bishop of Salisburie in his Reply against M. Harding / touching the
article of the supremacy. If all should be allowed of / that S. Ambrose
allows of / then besides other things which he holds corruptly / the
marriage of the ministers 1. lib. offic. cap. 50.
should go very hard: But it is worthy to be observed / with what words Amb.
does allow of the archbishop / that all men may understand / how low it
goes with M. Doctor / for his defense of the archbishop / and how the
archbishop is so out of credit / that there can not be gotten any to be surety
for his honesty.

Ambrose complaining of the ministers or bishops in those days / says / it a
man ask them / who preferred them to be priests / answer is made by and by /
that the archbishop for an hundredth shillings / ordained me bishop / to whom I
gave a hundredth shillings / that I might get the favor to be bishop / which if
I had not given / I had not been bishop. And afterward he says / that this
grieved him / that the archbishop ordained bishops carnally / or for some
carnal respect. And this is all the allowance that Ambrose shows of an
archbyshoppe. Your archbishop takes all things in good part / so that his
very dispraise he expounds to his commendation. And there is great likelyhode
/ that the archbishop which Ambrose makes mention of / was no other / then he
which for the time ruled the action / wherein bishops were ordained / and after
the action ended / had no more authority then the rest.

And I am moved so to think. First / because it is not like / that one only
ordained bishops / being contrary to the old Canons of the best councelles /
but that there were other / and that this whom Ambrose calls archbishop /
did gather the voices. etc.

Secondly / because it was very unlike / that there was any absolutely / above
S. Ambrose / in those parts where he complains of evil bishops / or
ministers made.

Thirdly / for that Ambrose in an other place (which you after cite) dividing
all the church into the cleargye and laitye / does subdeuide the clergy into
bishops / elders / and deacons / and therefore it is not like that there was any
which had any continual function of archbishop. But as he was called choregos
or leader of the dau^ce / which comes first / and after coming in again in
the second or third place / is no more so called: so that bishop was called
archbishop / which for the time present did gather the voices of the rest of
the bishops / which he by and by laid down with the dissoluing of the
meeting. And that this is not my conjecture only / that there was no ordinarye
or absolute archbishop / let the Centuries be seen / which allege that place
of Ambrose / to prove that the office of an archbishop / was not then come into
the church / which was. 400 years after Christ / and more also.

Basile you say the great Metropolitan of Cappadocia. I have showed what the
word metropolitan signifies / and how there was not then such a
metropolitan as we have now / and as ye admonition speaks against. You play
as he which is noted as none of the wisest amongst ye merchants / which thought
that every ship that approached the haven / was his ship: for so you think
that wheresoever you read metropolitan or archbishop / forthwith you think
there is your metropolitan or your archbishop / whereas it shall appear /
that besides the name / they are no more like then a bishop with us / is like a
minister.

I can not tell whether you would abuse your reader here / with the fallacion
of the accent / because this word (Great) is so placed between Basile and
metropolitan / that it may be as well referred to the metropolitan / as to
Bastle / and so you having put no comma, it seems you had as l^eue have your
reader read great metropolitan / as great Basil. But yt the simpler sort be
not deceived thereby / it is not out of the way to let the reader understand /
what a great metropolitan this was / which * appears / for that when he was
threatened by the Sozo. 6. l. c. 16.
magistrate / confiscation of his goods / answered / that he was not afraid
of the threatenings / and that all his goods were a very few books / and an
old gown / such were then those Metropolitanes / under whose shadows M.
Doctor goes about to shroude all this pomp / and princely magnificence of
our archbyshoppes.

As for Simeon archbishop of Seleucia / I will not deny / but at that time was
the name of archbyshops / for then Satan had made through the titles of
archbishop / primate / patriarch / as it were three stayers / whereby antichrist
might clime up into his curssed seat. Notwithstanding there wanted not good
decrees of godly councelles / which did strike at these proud names / and went
about to keep them down / but the swelling waters of the ambition of diverse
/ could not by any banks be kept in / which having once broken out in
certain places / afterward covered almost the face of the whole earth.

This endeavor of godly men / may appear in the council of Carthage / Conc.
Cartha. cap. 39.
which decreed that the bishop of the first seat / should not be called
exarchon ton hieron, e akron ierea, e toiouton tipore: that is / either the
chief of the priests / or the high priest / or any such thing / by which
words (any such thing) he shuts out the name of archbishop / and all such
hautie titles.

The same decree also was made in the Affricane council / and if you say
Council. Tom. 2. 1. c. 6.
that it was made against the Pope of Rome / or to forbid that any man should
be called archbishop / show me where there was either bishop of Rome / or any
other that ever made any such title or challenge / to be the general bishop of
all / at that time / when this council of Carthage was holden: when as the
first of those which did make any such challenge / was the bishop of
Constantinople / which notwithstanding challenged not the pre-eminence first
over all / but that he might ordain bishops of Asia / Pontus / Thracia /
which were before appointed by their Sinodes / and this was in the council of
Chalcedon / which was long after that council of Carthage before remembered.

For to prove the lawfulness of the name of an archdeacon / the antiquitye /
the necessitye of it / the testimonies of four are brought / which neither
speak of their lawfulnes / nor of their necessity / and they say not in deed
so much as God save them: and two of these witnesses are Popes / whereof the
first / and best / ordained that if the Metropolitan did not fetch his pall
at the apostolic sea of Rome / within three months after he were consecrated
/ that then he should lose his dignity / as Gratian witnesses in the decrees
y^ he ascribes unto Damasus.

I doubt not therefore that this is but a forger / upon whom you would father
the archdeacon / for that Damasus / in whose place you put this forger / lived
An. 387. at what time the sea of Rome had no such tirannye as this / and other
things which are fathered of him / do pretend. And if this be enough to prove
archdeacons / I can with better witness prove subdeacons / acoluthes,
exorcistes, lectores, ostiarios, these does Eusebius make mention of / an
auncienter writer / then any you bring / and out of Ruffine / Theodoret /
Sozomen / Socrates. etc. monks almost in every page. And here upon it is more
lawful for me to conclude / that monks / subdeacons / exorcistes, acoluthes,
ostiarij, lectores, are necessary ecclesiastical orders in the church / as you
conclude the necessity of the archdeacon.

I perceive you care not whether the archdeacon fall or no / that you bestow so
little cost of him / and leave him so nakedly. And if I would be but half so
hold in conjectures / and diuinations / as you are / I could say that this
sleighte handling of the archdeacon / and sweating so much about the
archbyshoppe / is thereupon y^ you woid be loath to come from being deane / to be
an archdeacon / and you live in some hope of being archbishop / but I will not
enter so far. And surely for any thing that I see / you might have trussed up
the archbishop as short / as you do the archdeacon. For they stand upon one
pin / and those reasons which establishe the one / establishe the other /
whereupon also comes to pass / that all those reasons which were before
alleged against the archbishop / may be drawn against the archdeacon / having
therefore before proved the unlawfulness of them / I will here set down the
difference between those archdeacons that were in times past / and those which
are now / whereby it may appear they are nothing like / but in name.

Sozo. 7. 19.
They were no ministers / as appears in Sozomen / ours are.

Council. Urban. Sozom. 7. lib. c. 19.
They were tied to a certain church / and were called archdeacon of such a
congregation or church / ours are tied to none / but are called archdeacons
of such a shire.

Ierom to Euagr.
They were chosen by all the Deacons of the church where they be archdeacons /
ours are appointed by one man / and which is no deacon.

Conc. Nic. can. 14. and after Ruff. can. 20.
They were subject to the minister of the word / ours are above them / and
rule over them.

Ieron. ad Euag. August. quest. noui and veteris testa. q. 101.
It was counted to them great arrogancy / if they preferred themselves to any
minister or elder of the church / ours will not take the best ministers of
the church as their equalles. If therefore archdeacons will have any benefit
by the archdeacons of old time / it is meet they should content them selves
with that place which they were in.

As for the office of a deane / as it is used with us / it is therefore
unlawful / for that he being minister / has no several charge or
congregation appointed wherein he may exercise his ministry / and for that
he is ruler / and as it were master of diverse other ministers in his college
/ which likewise have no several charges of congregations: and for that which
is most intolerable both he him self oftentimes having a several church or
benefice / as they call it / is under the color of his deaneship / absent
from his church / and suffers also those that are underneath him / to be
likewise absent from their churches. And whereas M. Doctor alleges S.
Augustine / to prove this office to be ancient / in deed the name is there
found / but besides the name / not one propertye of that Deane which we have.
For Augustine speaking of the monks of those days / says / that the money
which they gate with the labor of their hands / they gave to their deane /
which did provide them meat and drink / and cloth / and all things necessary
for them / so that the monks should not be drawn away from their studies and
meditations / through the care of worldly things / so that this deane which he
speaks of / was servant and steward / and cater to the monks / and therefore
only called deane / because he was steward and cater to ten monks. Now let it
be seen what Augustines deane / makes for the deane which is now / and what
faith and trust M. Doctor uses / in reciting of the old fathers.

And unto the end that these testimonies might be more autenticall / and have
some weight in them / M. Doctor adds / that hitherto antichrist had not
invaded the seat of Rome. You shall have much a do / to prove that antichrist
had not invaded the sea of Rome / when your Clement / Anaclete / Anicete / and
Damasus wrote. Nay / it is most certain / that then he had possessed it. But
what is that to the purpose / although there was no one singular head
appeared / or lifted up / yet corruption of doctrine / and of the sacraments /
hurtful ceremonies / dominion and pomp of the cleargye / new orders and
functions of the ministry / which were the hands that pulled him / the fete
which brought him / the shoulders that lifted and heaued him up into that seat
/ were in the church. Neither / while you do thus speak / do you seem to
remember that this monster needed nine months / but almost nine hundredth
years / to be framed and fashioned / or ever he could with all his parts be
brought to light. And although the Loouer of this antichristian building were
not set up / yet ye foundations thereof being secretly / and under the ground
laid in the apostles times / you might easily know / that in those times that
you speak of / the building was wonderfully aduau^ced and grown very high.
And being a very dangerous thing to ground any order or policy of the church
upon men at all / which in deed ought to have their standing upon the doctrine
and orders of the apostles / I will show what great injury M. Doctor does / to
send us for our examples and paternes of government to these times / which he
does direct us unto.

Eusebius out of Egesippus / writes / that as long as the apostles lived /
Eus. 3. lib. 32.
the church remained a pure virgin / for that / if there were any that went
about to corrupt the holy rule that was preached / they did it in the dark /
and as it were digging underneath the earth. But after ye death of the apostles
/ and ye generation was past / which God vouchsaued to hear the divine
wisdom with their own ears / then the placing of wicked error / began to
come into the church.

Clement also in a certain place to confirm that there was corruption of Lib.
Stromat. somewhat after the beginning. 7. lib. 11. ca.
doctrine immediately after the apostles times / alleges the proverb / that
there are few sons like their fathers.

And Socrates says of the church of Rome and Alexandria (which were the most
famous churches in the apostles times) that about the year. 430. the Roman
and Alexandrian bishops / leaving the sacred function / were degenerate to a
seculare rule or dominion. Whereupon we see how that it is safe for us to go
to the scriptures / and to the apostles times / for to fetch our government and
order. And that it is very dangerous to draw from those rivers / the
fountains whereof are troubled and corrupted / especially when as the ways
whereby they run / are muddier and more fennie / then is the head it self.

And although M. Doctor has brought neither scripture / nor reason / nor
council / wherein there is either name of archbishop or archdeacon / or proved
that there may be / and although he show not so much as the name of them. 400.
years after our savior Christ. And although where he shows them / they be
either by counterfeit authors / or without any word of approbation of good
authors / yet as though he had showed all / and proved all / having showed
nothing / nor proved nothing / he clappeth the hands to himself / and puts
the crown upon his own head / saying / that those that be learned / may
easily understand / that the names / archbishop / archdeacon / primate /
patriarche / be most ancient and approved of the eldest / best / worthiest
councels / fathers / writers. And a little afterward / that they are unlearned
/ and ignorant / which say otherwise.

Here is a victory blown with a great and sounding trumpet / that might have
been piped with an oten straw. And if it should be replied again / that M.
Doctor has declared in this / little learning / little reading / and les
judgment / there might grow controversies without all fruit. And by and by /
in saying that ye archbyshops beginning is unknown / in stead of a bastard /
which some brought into the church / that hid them selves because they were
ashamed of the child / he will make us believe that we have a new Melchisedech
/ without father / without mother / and whose generation is not known / and so
concludes with the place of S. Augustine / as far as he remembers in the.
118. epistle to January: that the original of them is from the apostles them
selves.

Here M. Doctor seems to seek after some glory of a good memory / as
though he had not Augustine by him / when he wrote this sentence. And yet he
maruellously forgets him self / for he used this place before in his. 23.
page / and cites it there precisely and absolutely / where also I have showed
how unadvisedly that sentence of Augustine is approved / and how that thereby
a window is open to bring in all popery / and whatsoever other corrupt
opinions. That the names of Lords / and honor / as they are used in this
realm / are not meet to be given to the ministers of the gospel / there has
been spoken before.

As for Prelate of the Garter / if it be a needful office / there are inow to
execute it besides the ministers / which / for as much as they be appointed to
watch over the souls of men purchased with the blood of Christ / all men
understand / that it is not meet that they should attend upon the body / much
les upon the leg / and least of all upon the Garter. It is not unlawful for
Princes to have ministers of their honor / but also it is not lawful to take
those that God has appointed for an other end / to use to such purposes.

Thou see here (good Reader) that M. Doctor keeps his old wont of
manifest perverting of the words and meaning of the authors of the admonition
/ for where as they say / that the name of Earl / County Palatine / Justice
of peace / and Quorum / Commissioner / are antichristian / when they are given
to ministers of the church / whose calling will not agree with such titles / he
concludes simply / that they say that they be altogether unlawful / and
simply antichristian. As / if I should reason that it is not meet that the
Queen's majesty should preach or minister the Sacraments / therefore it is not
meet that there should be any preaching or ministering of the sacraments.

Now letting pas all your hard words / and unbrotherly speeches / with your
uncharitable Prognostications / and cold prophesies / I will come to examine /
whether you have any better hap in proving the office / then you had in proving
the name.

And whereas in the former treatise of the name of the archbishop / he blew ye
trompet before the victory / here in this of the office he blows it / before
he comes into the field / or strikes one stroke / saying / that they little
consider what they write / that they are contemners of ancient writers / and
that they never red them / and that they are unlearned / which deny these
things which he affirms. Well / what we read / and how unlearned we are / is
not the matter which we strive for. The judgment thereof is first with God /
and then with the churches / and in their judgments we are content to rest.
But if you be so greatly learned / and we so unlearned / and smally red / then
the truth of our cause shall more appear / that is maintained with so small
learning and reading / against men of such profound knowledge and great
reading. And yet I know not why (if we be not to idle) we should not be able to
read as much as you / which may have leisure to read a good long writer / or
ever you can ride / only to see / and salute your houses and livings / being so
many / and so far dista^t one from an other. And if we be so unlearned / and
hold such dangerous opinions of Papistrie and Anabaptistry / as you bear men
in hand we do / why do you not by the example of the ministers in Germany /
procure a public disputation / where you may both win your spurs / and such
detestable opinions / with the ignorance of the authors / may be displayed unto
the whole world? But let us hear what is said.

Cyprian (says he) speaking of the office of an archbishop. etc. Onles (good
reader) thou will first believe that Cyprian speaks of an archbishop / and
haste before conceived a strong imagination of it / M. Doctor can prove
nothing. Aristotle says that uncunning Painters / write the names of the
beasts which they painte in their tables / for because otherwise it could not
be known what they painte: so M. Doctor mistrusting that the archbishop will
not be known by his description / writes first the name of that he will paint
out.

This is it which we strive about / whereof the co^trouersy is / and this M.
doctor takes for granted. He accuses the authors of the admonition / for
faulting in the petition of the principle / or desiring to have that granted
which is denied / and yet I am sure / that in the whole admonition / there is
not such a gross petition as this is. Where / or in what words does S.
Cyprian speak of the office of an archbishop? And here by the way it is to be
observed of the reader / how near a kin the Pope and the archbishop be. For
this office is confirmed by the same places / that the popes is / the places
and arguments which are brought against him / are soluted with the same
solutions that they use / which maintain the papacy. For these places of
Cyprian be alleged for the popes supremacye / and in deed they make as much
for the Pope / as for the archbyshoppe. For / although they be two heads / yet
they stand upon one neck / and therefore the reformed churches which cut
right / did strike them both of at one blow. In neither of the sentences
here alleged out of Cyprian / nor in all his works / as has been before
noted / is there one word of an archbishop / and yet M. doctor says that he
speaks of an archbishop.

Before he showed the name without the office / and now he goes about to show
the office without the name / so that he can never make both the name and
office meet together. To shape out an archbishop here / you must needs
interpreate the words (bishop and priest) archbishop and high priest / for
Cyprian makes mention of no other name of ministry in those places. And if
you may have this scope of interpreating / it will not be hard for you / to
prove that stones be bread / and that chaulke is cheese. Let us see what is a
bishop or priest (I use the name of priest against my will / but because it is
sacerdos, and you so translate it / that it may be better understood what I
answer to you / I am content to follow you so far) I say let us consider
what is a bishop or priest by S. Cyprian / and thereby we shall know / what an
archbishop he sets forth unto us. Which thing may appear manifestly / by
that which he says in the same Epistle / that the bishop that is appointed
into the place of him that is dead / is chosen peaceably by the voice of all
the people.

I think you will not say that all the people through out the whole province
/ or through out a whole diocese (as we count a diocese) met together / for
that had been both a great disorder and confusion / a great charge to the
church / and in the time of persecution as that was / to have offered the whole
church in all the province / into the mouth of the wolf.

And least peradventure you should have this hole to hide your self in /
saying that it might be procured / that in every church or parish through out
either the province or diocese / the consent of the people might be asked / and
they tarry in their places where they dwell / Cyprian in the next epistle / does
put the matter out of all question / saying that the priest (whom he after
calls bishop) is chosen in the presence of the people / and in the eyes of
all / so that Cyprians bishop / whom you will needs have an archbishop / had
neither province nor diocese / as we call a diocese / but only a church or
congregation / such as the ministers and pastors with us / which are appointed
unto several towns. Which may further appear / in that Cyprian says / that
out of one province there were. 90. bishops / which condemned Priuatus. Now /
if there were. 90. bishops in one province which met / and yet not all that
were in that province (as may appear out of the same Epistle) all men do
understand that the scope that Cyprians bishop or archbishop (as you will have
him) had / was no such thing as a diocese or a province. I could bring
infinite testimonies out of Cyprian / to prove that the bishop in his time /
was nothing else but S. Paul's bishop / that is / one that had cure and charge
of one flock / which was so placed as it might be taught of him / and
ouerseene by him / and governed by him / and of whom in matters pertaining to
God / it might depend.

Furthermore / to shape the archbishop by these places of Cyp. you must be
driven to expound this word (church) province. The papists (which cite this
place for the pope / as you do for the archbishop) expound the word
(church) here / to be the whole church universal and catholic / and in deed
/ although it be falsely expounded so in this place / yet may they do it with
more probability and likelyhode / then to expound it a province / for so much as
these words (the church) is oftener red / both in the scripture / and old
writers / to signify the whole church / then any province of one realm. But
let Cyprian expound him self what he means by a church here / although
that may easily appear by that / which is spoken of S. Cyprian his bishop.
Whereas Cyprian declares / that Cornelius the bishop of the church which was in
Rome / would not let Felicissimum a Nouation heretic / being cast out by
the bishops of Affricke / to enter into the church / he declares
sufficiently / that he means that company of the faithful / which were
gathered together at Rome / to hear the word / and to communicate at the
sacraments. For it was not Cornelius part to shut him out of the province /
neither indeed could he / him self being not able without hazard (by reason
of the persecution that then was) to tarry in any part of the province. Again /
speaking against the Nouatian heretic / he shows that through his wicked
opinion of denying of repentance to those that were fallen / the confession of
faults in the church was hindered. Now it is manifest that confession was not
made through out the province / but in that particulare church where the party
dwelt that committed the fault. Therefore Cyprian understands by the name of
the church / neither diocese (as we call diocese) and much les a whole
province. And in the same Epistle / speaking of those which had fallen / he
says / that they durst not come so much / as to the thresholde / or entry of
the church / where he also opposes the church to the province / saying that
they roue about the province / and run about to deceive the brethren. Seeing
therefore / the bishop which Cyprian speaks of / is nothing else but such as
we call pastor / or as the common name with us is parson / and his church whereof
he is bishop / is neither diocese nor province / but a congregation which mete
together in one place / and to be taught of one man / what should M. doctor
mean to put on this great name of archbishop / upon so small a byshoppricke?
as it were Saules great harnes / upon David his little body / or as if a man
should set a wide huge porche / before a little house.

And least that M. doctor should say / that notwithstanding the bishops had but
several churches / yet one of them might have either a title more excellent
then the rest / or authority and government over the rest / that shall be
likewise considered out of Cyprian. And first for the title and honor of
archbishop / it appears how Cyprian held that as a proud name / for that he
obiecteth to Florentius as a 4. lib. 9. epist.
presumptuous thing / for that in believing certain evil reports of him / and
misiudging of him / he did appoint him self bishop of a bishop / and judge
over him / which was for the time / appointed of God to be judge. And herein
also / I may use the same reasons which the godly writers of our times use
against ye pope / to prove yt he had no superiority in those days over other
bishops / for that the other bishops called him brother / and he them / called
him fellow bishop / and he them. For so does Cyprian call ye bishops of that
province in his epistle / his fellow bishops / and in diverse places his
brethren. And in the sentence which he spoke in the counsel of Carthage / he
says / none of us does take him self to be bishop of bishops.

Now / that there was no authority of one bishop over an other / and that
there was none such / as when controversies roase / took upon him the
compounding of them / or any one to whom it appertained / to see the unity of
the church kept / and to see that all other bishops / and the clergy / did
their duty (as M. Doctor bears us in hand) it may clearly be seen in
diverse places of Cyprian / and first of all in that sentence / which he spoke
in the council of Carthage, where he proceeds further after this sort / that
none of them did by any tirannicall fear / bind his fellows in office / or
any fellow bishops / to any necessity of obedience / seeing that every bishop
has for his free liberty and power / his own judgment or discretion / as
one which can not be judged of an other / as he also him self / can not judge
an other. But (says he) we ought to tarry and wait for the judgment of our
Lord Jesus Christ / which only / and alone / has power to set us over his
church / and to judge of our doing. And in the same Epistle whereout the first
place is taken by M. Doctor / he says that unto every one a portion of the
flock is appointed / which every one must rule and govern / as he that shall
render an account of his deed unto the Lord. And in an other place he 2. Lib.
ep. 1.
says / we do not use any compulsion or vyolence over any / nor appoint no
law to any / seeing that every one that is set over the church / has in the
government / the free disposition of his own will / whereof he shall give an
account unto the Lord. And yet Cyprian was the bishop of the metropolitan or
chief seat / and one whom for his learning and godliness / the rest no
doubt had in great reverence / and gave great honor unto.

And whereas it is said for the preservation of unity / one must be over all
/ S. Cyprian shows / that the unity of the church is conserved / not by
having 4. Lib. ep. 9.
one bishop over all. But by the agreement of the bishops / one with an other.
For so he writes that the church is knit and coupled together (as it were with
the glue) of the bishops consenting one with an other / and as for the
compounding of controversies / it is manifest / that it was not done by one
bishop in a province / but those bishops which were near the place where the
schism or heresy sprang.

For / speaking of the appeasing of controversies / and schisms / and showing
Lib. 1. 4. ep.
how diverse bishops were drawn into the heresy of Nouatus / he says / that
the virtue and strength of the Christians was not so decayed or languished /
but that there was a portion of priests / which did not give place unto those
ruins / and shipwrackes of faith.

And in an other place he says: therefore most dear brother / the plentiful
3. Lib. ep. 13.
body or company of ye priests / are as it were with the glue of mutual
concord and band of unity joined together / that if any of our company be
author of an heresy / and go about to destroy and rent the flock of Christ /
the rest should help / and as profitable and merciful shepherds / gather
together the sheep of the Lord: whereby it is manifest / that the appeasing and
composing of controversies / and heresies was not then thought to be most fit
to be in one bishops hand / but in as many as could conveniently assemble
together / according to the danger of the heresy which sprang / or deep root
which it had taken / or was like to take. And that there was in his time no
such authority given / as that any one might remove the causes or
controversies which rose / as now we see there is / when the bishop of the
diocese / takes the matters in controversy / which rise in any church within
his diocese / from the minister and elders / to whom the decision pertayneth /
and as when the archbishop takes it away from the bishop / it may appear in
ye same third Epistle of the first book / where he says after this sort. It
is ordained / and it is equal and right / that every man's cause should be
there heard / where the fault was committed. And a little after he says: It
is meet to handle the matter there / where they may have both accusers / and
witnesses of the fault / which although it be spoken of them / which fied out
of Affrike unto Rome / yet the reason is general / and does as well serve
against these Ecclesiastical persons / which will take unto them the decyding
of those controversies that were done a hundredth mile of them.

And whereas M. Doctor in both places of Cyprian / seems to stand much upon
the words (One Bishop and priest) the reason thereof does appear in an other
place of Cyprian / most manifestly / and that it makes no more to prove that
Lib. 3. 13. ep.
there ought to be one archbishop over a hole province / then to say / that
there ought to be but one husband proves / that therefore there should be but
one husband in every country or province / which should see that all the
rest of the husbands / do their duties to their wives. For this was the
case. A Nouatian heretic being condemned / and cast out of the churches of
Africa / by the consent of the bishops / and not able by embassage sent to
them to obtain to be received to their communion and fellowship again / goes
afterward to Rome / and being likewise there repelled / in time gets him
self by certain which favored his heresy / to be chosen bishop there at
Rome (Cornelius being the bishop or pastor of those which were there godly
minded) whereupon it comes / that Cyprian urges (one bishop / one priest in
the church) because at Rome there was two / whereof one was a wolf / which
ought not to have been there / considering there was but one church / which was
gathered under the government of Cornelius. And therefore by that place of
Cyprian it can not be gathered / that there ought to be but one bishop in one
city / if the multitude of professors require more / and that all can not well
gather them selves together in one congregation / to be taught of one man /
much less can it serve to prove / that there should be but one in a whole
diocese or province. I grant that in later times / and which went more from
the simplicity of the primitive church / they took occasion of these words
to decree / that there should be but one bishop in a city / but that can never
be concluded of Cyprians words / if it be understood why he urges one
bishop and one priest. If therefore neither word (bishop nor priest) do make
any thing to prove an archbishop / nor this word (church) does imply any
province / nor in these words (one bishop one priest) there is nothing less
meant / then that there should be one archbishop over all the bishops and
clergy in a province / and if Cyprian will neither allow of the title of
archbishop / nor of the authority and office / but in plain words speaks
against both / we may conclude / that M. Doctor has done very unadvisedly / to
lay so great weight of the archbishop upon S. Cyprians shoulders / that
w^ilnot only not bear any thing of him / but which has done all that could
be / to make him go a foot / and hand in hand with his fellows. There are
other reasons which M. Doctor uses / as this / a notable one. S. Cyprian
speaks not of the usurped power of the bishop of Rome / therefore he speaks
of the office of an archbishop and metropolitan. It is hard to call this
argument to any head of fallation / for it has not so much as a color of a
reason / and I think it can deceive no body but your self. An other reason is
/ that all the godlyest and best learned me^ do expound the place of Cyprian in
the 3. Epist. of the first book of an archbishop. The vanity of this saying /
that the godly and learned writers so expound it / I have showed before / and
here it comes to be considered again. I will not say that no godly nor
learned writer / expounds the place of Cyprian of the authority of an
archbishop.

But first I desire M. Doctor to set down but one / and then I will leave it
to thy consyderation (gentle reader) to think / whether M. Doctor has red
any learned or godly man's exposition to be such / when he has not red those
which are nearest him / I mean our own country men. I say he has not red
them / because I would think charitably so of him / rather then that he
should have red them / and yet speak untruly of them / and father those
things of them / which they never speak.

M. Jewel the bishop of Sarisburie expounded this place / and yet did never In
his first book. 4. article / and in dyansion. 5.
expound it / of the office and authority of an archbishop of all the bishops
/ and clergy of the province / but clean contrariwise applies it to the
authority that every bishop had in his diocese / his words are these: Now
therefore to draw that thing by violence to one only bishop / that is generally
spoken of all bishops / is a guilefull fetch to misseleade the reader / and no
simple nor plain dealing. Here you see that M. Iuel does not understand this
of any archbishop / but of every bishop.

M. Nowel Deane of Poules / having occasion to speak of this place / says
First book against Dorman / and. 25. leaf.
on this sort. So that when he speaks (meaning Cyprian) of one bishop / one
judge in the church / for the time / or of the bishop which is one / and
rules the church absolutely / he means every bishop in his own diocese
without exception. If he speak specially / he means the bishop of the city
or diocese whereof he entreats / whether it be the bishop of Rome / Carthage /
or any other place.

M. Fore also expounds this of every bishop within his own church 1. Tom.
fol. ^*
or diocese. You hear the judgment of these three writers / that can not
pick out neither the name / nor the office of an archbishop out of Cyprians
place / and yet I think you will not deny / but these were learned and godly
writers. Now I have showed you three / I ask once again of you one godly and
learned writer / that expounds it as you do. And by this time I suppose all
men understand / what a small friend S. Cyprian is / either to the name or
office of an archbishop. Let us hear whether Jerome make any more for the
archbishop / then did Cyprian.

The Hebrews do derive the name of time of a verb / which signifies to
corrupt / because in deed it does corrupt all / and as the times are / so are
me^ which live in them / that even very good men carye the note of the
infection of the times / wherein they live / and the stream of the corruption
thereof / being so vehement and forcible / does not only drive before it / light
things / but it cateth also and wears the very hard and stony rocks / and
therefore there is not to be looked for / such sincerity at Jerome his hand /
which we found in S. Cyprian / considering that he lived some ages after
Cyprian / what time satan had a great deal more darkened the clear light of
the son of the gospel / then it was in S. Cyprians time. For as those that
came nearest unto the apostles times / because they were nearest the light *
did see best / so those that were further of from these lights / had / until
the time of the manifestation of the son of perdition their heavens more
dark and cloudy / and consequently did see more dimly / which is diligently to
be observed of the reader / both the better to understand the state of this
question / and all other controversies which lie between us and the papists.

And although Jerome besides his other faults / might have also in this matter
spoken more soundly / yet we shall easily perceive / that he is a great deal
further / from either the title or office of an archbishop / or else from the
authority that a bishop has with us / then he is from the simplicity of the
ministry which ought to be / and is commended unto us by the word of God.

And here I must put M. Doctor in remembrance / how unfitly he has dedicated
his book unto the church / which has so patched it / and peeced it of a
number of shreds of the doctors / that a sentence of the scripture / either
truly or falsely alleged / is as it were a Phoenix in this book. If he would
have had the church believe him / he ought to have settled their judgment / and
grounded their faith upon the scriptures / which are the only foundations
whereupon the church may build. Now he does not only not give them ground to
stand of / but he leads them into ways which they can not follow / nor come
after him. For / except it be those which are learned / and besides / have the
means and abilitye / to have the books which are here cited (which are the
least and smallest portion of the church) how can they know that these things
be true which are alleged / and as I have said / if they could know / yet have
they nothing to stay them selves upon / and quiet their conscience / in
allowing that which M. Doctor would so feign have them like of. Therefore he
might have much more fitly dedicated his book unto the learned and rich /
which have furnished libraries.

Jerome says / that at the first / a bishop and an Elder (which you call
priest) were all one / but afterward through factions / and schisms / it was
decreed / that one should rule over the rest. Now I say against this order
(that the bishop should bear rule over all) that which our savior Christ
says unto the Pharisees / from the beginning it was not so / and therefore I
require that the first order may stand / which was / that a bishop and elder
were all one. And if you place so great authority against the institution of
God in a mortal man: hear what Tertullian says unto you. Contra prax.


That is true / whatsoever is first: and that is false / whatsoever is later.

Jerome and you / confess that this was first / that the bishop was all one
with the elder / and first also by the word of God / then I conclude that that
is true. You both do likewise confess that it came after that one bare rule
over the rest / then I conclude that that is false / for all that is false that
is later. Furthermore Jerome in the same place of Titus says after this sort.
As the elders know them selves to be subject by a custom of the church unto
him that is set over them: so the bishops must know that they are greater then
the elders / rather by custom then by any truth of the institution of the Lord
/ and so they ought to govern the church in common.

Now / seeing that Jerome confesses that a bishop and an elder / by God his
institution are all one / and that custom of the church has altered this
institution / for the taking away of this custom and restoring of the Lords
institution / I say as our savior Christ said / why do you break the
commandments of Math. 15. 3.
God / to establishe your own traditions? for the one is the institution of
God / and the other the tradition of the church / and if a man's testimony be so
much with M. Doctor / let him hear what the same Tertullian faith: whatsoever
sauoureth De veland virg.
against the truth / shall be accounted heresy / even although it be an old
custom. Now I will turn M. Doctors own argument upon his head / after this
sort. In the apostles times there were schisms and heresies / but in their
times there were no archbyshops ordained to appease them / therefore the best
means of composing of controversies / and keeping concord / is not by having
an archbishop to be over a whole province. That there was none in the apostles
times / thus it may appear. If there were any / they were either ordained by
the apostles and their authority / or else without / and besides their
authority. If there were any without / and besides their authority / then
they are therefore to be condemned the more / because in their times they
starte up without their warrant. And if the apostles did ordain them / there
was some use of them to that whereunto they were ordained / but there was no use
of them / to that whereunto they were ordained / therefore the apostles did not
ordain them. The use whereunto M. Doctor says they were ordained / was to
compose controversies / and end schisms / but to this they were not used /
whereupon it follows / that if there were any / they were unprofitable. That
they were not used to any such end / it shall be perceived by that which
follows.

At Antioche there rose a great and dangerous heresy / that had in a manner
Act. 15. 2.
infected all the churches / which shaked the very foundation of the salvation
of Gods children / that was / whether faith were sufficient to justify without
circumcision. The matter was disputed of both sides / it could not be agreed
of. What do they now? Do they ordain some Archbishop / Archprophet /
Archapostle / or any one chief to whom they will refer the controversy /
or upon whom they will depend? nothing less. And if they would have had the
controtrouersies ended by one / what divine was there ever / or shall there be
more fitter for that purpose then S. Paul / which was amongst them? Why do
they send abroad for remedy / when they had it at home? why with great charges
and long iourneys / which they might have had without charges / or one foot
set out of the door? what do they then? They send Paul and Barnabas to
Jerusalem / as if the lesser towns / should send to the churches of the
universities / and of London / to desire their help in the determining of the
controversy. And what is Paul and Barnabas embassage / is it to desire the
judgment or mind of some one? it must needs be answered with S. Luke / that
they came to know Acts. 15. 23.
the resolution of the church / and yet there were the apostles / whereof every
one was better able both sharply to see / and to judge incorruptly without
affection / then any archbishop that ever was. If therefore in so great
abundance and ouerflowing of the gifts of God / and in that time when as
controversies might have been referred without danger of error unto one only /
this ministry of one above all / was not thought good: now / when the gifts
are les / and the danger of error more / to make an archbishop for the deciding
of controversies / and avoiding of schisms / is a thing so strange / that I
am not able to see the reason of it. For to which so ever of the apostles the
controversy had been referred / it is certain that he would have given a true
sentence of it.

And if any can show me one man in these times / of whom we may be assured /
that he will pronounce the truth of every question which shall arise / he shall
make me somewhat more favorable to the archbishop / then presently I am. For
although there were found one such as could not err / yet I could not consent
that the matter should lie only upon his hand / seeing that the apostles which
could not err in these matters / would not take that upon them / and seeing
that by that means the judgment of the church should be contemned / and
further / for that the judgment of one man in a controversy / is not so strong
to pull up errors that are rooted in men's minds / as the judgment and
consent of many. For / that the judgment of many is very apt either to
confirm a truth / or to confute falshode / it is evident that S. Paul does
hold forth / as it were a buckler 1. Cor. 11. 16. 1. Cor. 14. 33.
against the frowardnes of certain / the authority of the church.

Furthermore / if this distinction came up in the apostles time / and by them /
how comes it to pas / that they never mention it / nay / how comes it to
pas that even S. Paul in that very Epistle where these voices are found (I
hold of Paul / I of Apollo / I of Cephas which are said to be the cause of the
archbishop / 1. Cor. 14. 29.
) ordains a clean contrary to this that M. Doctor commends? For when two
or three prophets have expounded the scriptures / he appoynteth that all the
rest that are there / should judge whether they have done well or no.

And how comes it to pas that S. Paul being at Rome in prison / and loking
every day when he should give up his last breath / commended unto the church a
perfect and an absolute ministry / standing of.v. parts / wherein he makes
Ephesians. 4. 11.
mention / not one word of an archbishop: and says further / that that
ministry is able to entertain the perfect unity / and knitting together of the
church? Do not all these things speak / or rather cry / that there was not so
much as a step of an archbishop / in the apostles times? And if you will say /
that the apostles did ordain archbyshops (as you have in deed said / and do
now again) when as there is not one word in the wrytings of them / I pray you
tell us / how we shall hold out of the church / the unwritten verities of the
papists? for my part / if it be true that you say / I can not tell what to
answer unto them. For our answer is to the^ / the apostles have left a perfect
rule of ordering the church written / and therefore we reject their traditions /
if / for no other cause / yet because they are superfluous / and more then
need. Now this degree of archbishop / being not only not mentioned in the
scriptures / but also manifestly oppugned / it is too bold and hardy a speech
(that I say no more) to fetch the petegree of the archbishop / from the
apostles times / and from the apostles them selves. But all this time M. Doctor
has forgotten his question / which was to prove an archbishop / whereas all
these testimonies which he alleges / make mention only of a bishop / and
therefore this may rather confirm the state of the bishop in this realm / the^
the archbishop. But in the answer unto them it shall appear / that as there
is not in these places so much as the name of an archbishop mentioned / so
except only the name of a bishop / there shall be found very little agreement
between the bishops in those days / and those which are called bishops in our
time / and with us.

And consequently / although M. doctor thought with one whiting box / to have
whited two walls (by establishing our archbishop and bishop by the same
testimonies of the fathers) yet it shall be plain / that in going about to
defend both / he left both undefended. Let us therefore come first / to examine
Ieroms reasons / why one must be over the rest / for in the testimony of men /
that is only to be regarded / which is spoken either with some authority of the
scripture / or with some reason grounded of the scripture: otherwise / if he
speak without either scripture or reason / he is as easily rejected as
alleged. One (says he) being chosen to be over the rest / brings remedy
unto schisms: how so? least every man (says he) drawing to him self / to
break the church in pieces.

But I would ask if the church be not in as great danger / when all is done at
the pleasure and lust of one man / and when one caryeth all into error / as
when one pulls one piece with him / another an other piece / and the third
his partalso with him. And it is harder to draw many into an error / then one /
or that many should be carried away by their affections / then one / which is
evident in water / which if it be but a little / it is quickly troubled and
corrupted / but being much / it is not so easily. But by this ecclesiastical
Monarchy / all things are kept in peace: Nay / rather it has been the cause
of discord / and well spring of most horrible schism / as it is to be seen in
the very decretals them selves. And admit it Decret. part. 2. c. 9. q. 3. and
can. Apost. 33. and alibi passim.
were so / yet the peace which is without truth / is more execrable the^ a
thousand contentions. For / as by striking of two flintes together / there
comes out fire / so it may be / that sometimes by contention / the truth
which is hidden in a dark peace / may come to light / which by a peace in
naughtines and wickedness / being as it were buried under the ground / does not
appear.

If therefore superiority and domination of one above the rest / have such force
to keep men from schisms / when they be in the truth / it has as great force
to keep them together in error / and so besides that one is easier to be
corrupted then many / this power of one brings as great incommodity in keeping
them in error if they fall into it / as in the truth if they are in it.
Moreover / if it be necessary for the keeping of unity in the church of England
/ that one archbishop should be primate over all / why is it not as meet /
that for the keeping of the whole universal church / there should be one
archbishop / or bishop over all / and the like necessity of the bishop over all
christendom / as of the bishop of all England / unless peradventure it be more
necessary / that there should be one bishop over the universal church / then
over the church of England / for as much as it is more necessary that peace
should be kept / and schisms be avoided in the universally church / then in the
particulare church of England.

If you say that the archbishop of England / has his authority granted of the
Prince / the Pope of Rome will say that Constantine or Phocas / which was
Emperor of all christendom / did grant him his authority over all churches.
But you will say that it is a lie / but the Pope will set as good a face / and
make as great a show therein / as you do in diverse points here. But admit it to
be a lie (as in deed it is touching Constantine) yet I say further / that it
may come to pass / and it has been / that there may be one Christian Caesar
over all the realms which have churches. What if he then will give that
authority to one over all / that one king grants in his land / may any man
accept and take at his hand such authority? and if it be not lawful for him to
take that authority / tell me what fault you can find in him / which may not be
found in them?

It will be said that no one is able to do the office of a bishop / unto all
the whole church / neither is there any one able to do the office of a bishop
to ye whole church of England. For when those which have been most excellent in
knowledge and wisdom / and most ready and quick / in doing and dispatching /
matters / being always present / have found enough to do to rule and govern
one several congregation: what is he which (absent) is able to discharge his
duty toward so many thousand churches? And if you take exception / that
although they be absent / yet they may do by under ministers / as by
Archdeacons / Chauncellors / Officials / Commissaries / and such other kind of
people / what do you else say / then the Pope / which says / that by his
Cardinals / and archbyshoppes / and Legates / and other such like / he does
all things? For with their hands he rules all / and by their feet he is
present every where / and with their eyes he sees what is done in all places.
Let them take heed therefore / least if they have a common defense with the
Pope / that they be not also joined nearer with him in the cause / then
peradventure they be aware of. Truly it is against my will / that I am
constrained to make such comparisons / not that I think there is so great
diversity between the Popedom and the archbyshoppricke / but because there
being great resemblance between them / I mean / having regard to the bare
functions / without respecting the doctrine good or badde which they uphold /
that I say there being great resemblance between them: there is yet as I am
persuaded / great difference between the parsons that execute them. The which
good opinion conceived of them / I we most humbly beseech them by the glory
of God / by the liberty of the church purchased by the precious blood of
our savior Christ / and by their own salvation / that they would not
deceive / by retaining so hard / such excessive and unjust dominion over the
church of the living God.

But Jerome says / that this distinction of a bishop / and a minister or elder
/ was from s. Mark his time / unto Dyonisius time / whereby M. doctor would
make us believe / that Mark was the author of this distinction. But that can
not be gathered by Ieromes words. For besides that things being ordered then by
the suffrages of the ministers and elders / it might (as it falls out of
te^times) be done without the approbation of s. Mark: the words (from Mark)
may be rather taken exclusiuely / to shut out S. Mark / and the time wherein
he lived / then inclusiuely / to shut him in the time wherein this distinction
rose.

How so ever it be / it is certain that S. Mark did not distinguish and make
those things diverse / which the holy ghost made all one. For then (which the
Lord forbid) he should make the story of the gospel which he wrote /
suspected.

Again / it is to be observed that Jerome says it was so in Alexandria:
signifying thereby / that in other churches it was not so. And in deed it may
appear in diverse places of the ancient fathers / that they confounded priest
and bishop / and took them for all one / as Eusebius out of Ireneus calls
Anicete / Pius / Telesphorus / Higinus / xystus / presbyterous cai prostantas,
elders / and presidents. Cyprian confounds priest and bishop in the epistles
before recited / so Lib. 5. 26. De dignitate sacerdotali. 1. Romans 8.
does Ambrose in the place alleged before by M. doctor / and yet it is one
thing with us / to be a priest (as M. doctor speaks) and an other thing to be
a bishop.

Jerusalem was a famous church / so was Rome as the apostle witnesses / so was
Antioche and others / where also were great conte^tions / both in doctrine and
otherwise / and yet for avoiding of contention and schism there / there was no
one that was ruler of the rest / therefore we ought rather to follow these
churches being many / in keeping us to the institution of the apostles / then
Alexandria being but one church / and departing from that institution / and if
there had been any one set over all the rest in other places / it would have
made much for the distinction that Jerome had recited. But against this
distinction of s. Jerome / I will use no other reason / the^ that which Jerome
uses in the same epistle to Euagrius. Jerome in that epistle / takes up very
sharply the archd. that he preferred him self before the elder / and the
reason is / because by the scripture ye deacon is inferior unto the elder. Now
therefore Jerome him self confessing that by the scripture a bishop and an
elder are equal / by Ieromes own reason / the bishop is to be sharply
reprehended / because he lifts him self above the elder. But what helps it
you / that there was a bishop of Alexandria / which urge an archbishop / or
what auauntageth it you / that there was one chief called a bishop in every
several congregation / which would prove that there ought to be one bishop /
chief over a thousand congregations. What could have been brought more strong
to pull down the archbishop out of his throne / then that which Jerome says
there / when he affirms that ye bishop of the obscurest village or hamlet /
has as great authority and dignity as the bishop of Rome? Erasmus did see this
/ and said / eironeuomenos, that is iestingly / that Jerome spoke that of the
bishops of his times / but if he had seen how the metropolitanes of our age
excel other bishops / he would have spoken otherwise. And what could have been
more fit to have confuted the large dominion and superiority of our realm /
then that that Jerome says / when he appoynteth the bishops sea in an
vplandishe town / or in a pore village or hamlet / declaring thereby that in
every town there was a bishop / and that the bishop that he speaks of /
differs nothing at all from an elder / but that the bishop had the ordaining
of the ministers / whereupon it does appear (which I promised to show) that by
this place of Jerome / there is neither name of archbishop / nor so much as the
shadow of his authority / and that the bishops which are now / have besides the
name / no similitude almost with the bishops that were in Ieromes time / as for
his reason / ad Luciferanos, it is the same which he has / ad Euag. and to
Titus / and is already answered.

What is that to the purpose / that Chrysostom says / there must be degrees?
who denies that there are degrees of functions? we confess there is / and ought
to be a degree of pastors / an other of doctors / the third of those which are
called elders / the fourth of deacons. And where he says / there should be one
degree of bishop / another of a minister / an other of the lay man / what
proves that for the office of an archbishop / which is your purpose to show?
how often times must you be called ad Rhombum? And that he means nothingles /
then to make any such difference between a bishop and a minister / as is with
us / which you would feign make your reader believe / I will send you to
Chrysostom / upon the third chapter. 1. ep. to Timothe / where he says: The
office of a bishop differs little or nothing from an elders / and a little
after / that a bishop differs nothing from an elder or minister / but by the
ordination only. Still M. doctor goes forward in killing a dead man / that is
/ in confuting that / which all men condemn / and proving that which no man
denies / that there must be superiority amongst men / and that equality of all
men a like / confounds all / and overthrows all.

This is a notable argument / there must be some superior among men: ergo, one
minister must be superior to an other. Again / there must be in the
ecclesiastical fu^ctions / some degrees: Ergo, there must be an archbishop over
the whole province / or a bishop over the whole diocese. And all be it M.
doctor takes great pain to prove that which no man denies / yet he does it
so evil fauoredly / and so unfitly / as that if a man had no better proufes
then he brings / the degrees of the ecclesiastical functions / might fall to
the ground. For here to prove the degrees of the ecclesiastical functions /
he brings in that / that Chrysostom says / there must be magistrate and
subject / him that commands / and him that obeys.

The most therefore that he can conclude of this / for the mynistery / is /
that there must be minister that shall rule / and people that shall be obedient
/ and hereby he can not prove that there should be any degrees amongst the
ministers / and ecclesiastical governors / unless he will say peradventure /
that as there are under Magistrates / and a king above them all / so there
should be under mynisters / and one mynister above them all. But he must
remember that it is not necessary in a common wealth / that there should be one
over all / for that there are other good common wealths / wherein many have
like power and authority. And further / if because there is one king in a
land above all / he will conclude there should be one archbishop over all: I
say / as I have said / that it is not against any word of God which I know
(although it be inconvenient) but that there may be one Caesar over all the
world / and yet I think M. Doctor will not say / that there may be one
archbishop over all the world.

Now M. Doctor comes to his old hole / where he would feign hyde him self
/ and with him all the ambition / tyranny / and excess of authority / which
is joined with these functions of archbyshoppe / and bishop / as they are now
used: and this his hole is / that all the mynisters are equal with bishops /
and archbyshops / as touching the mynisterie of the word and sacraments / but
not as touching policy and government. The papists use the very self same
distinction / for the mayntenance of the Popes tyranny and ambytion / and other
their hierarchy.

Master Doctor has put out the mark / and conceled the name of the papists
/ and so with a little change of words / as it were with certain new
colors / he would deceive us. For the papists say / that every sir John or
hedge priest / has as great authority to sacrifice and offer for the quick
and the dead / and to mynister the sacraments as the Pope of Rome has / but
for government / and for order / the bishop is above a priest / the
archbyshoppe above a bishop / and the Pope above them all. But I have
declared before out of the scriptures / how vain a distinction it is / and it
appears out of Cyprian / that as all the bishops were equal one to an other
/ so he says / that to every one was given a portion of the Lords flock /
not only to feed with the word and sacraments / but to rule and govern /
not as they which shall make any accoumpte unto an archbishop / or be judged of
him / but as they which can not be judged of any / but of God. And Jerome upon
Titus says / that the elder or mynister did govern and rule in common with
the bishops / the church whereof he was elder or mynister.

After follows M. Calvin / a great patron forsooth / of the archbishop / or
of this kind of bishop which is used amongst us here in England. And here
to pass over your strange cytations and quotations which you make / to put
your answerer to pain / sending him sometimes to Musculus common places for
one sentence / to Augustines works / to Chrysostomes works / to Cyrill / to
Master Fox / and here sending him to the viij. chapter of the institutions /
as though you had never red Caluins institutions / but took the sentence of
some body else / without any examination / whereby it seems that you were
loathe that ever any man should answer your book / letting I say all this
pass / what makes this either to prove that there should be one
archbyshoppe over all the mynisters in the province / or one bishop over all
in the diocese / that amongst twelve / that were gathered together into one
place / there was one which ruled the action / for which they met? And that
it may appear what superiority it is / which is lawful amongst the mynisters
/ and what it is that M. Calvin speaks of / what also the fathers and
councels do mean / when they give more to the bishop of any one church /
then to the elder of the same church / and that no man be deceived by the name
of gouernoure or ruler over the rest / to fancy any such authority and
domination or Lordship / as we see used in our church / it is to be
understood / that amongst the pastors / elders and deacons of every
particulare church / and in the meetinges and companies of the mynisters or
elders of diverse churches / there was one chosen by the voices and suffrages of
them all / or the most part / which did propound the matters that were to be
handled / whether they were difficulties to be soluted / or punishments and
censures to be decreed upon those which had faulted / or whether there were
elections to be made / or what other matter so ever occasion was given to
entreat of / the which also gathered the voices and reasons of those which had
interest to speak in such cases / which also did pronounce according to the
number of the voices which were given / which was also the mouth of the rest /
to admonish / or to comfort / or to rebuke sharply / such as were to receive
admonishment consolation / or rebuke / and which in a word did moderate that
whole action / which was done for the time they were assembled: which thing we
do not deny / may be / but affirm that it is fit and necessary to be / to
the avoiding of confusion. For it were an absurd hearing that many should at
once attempt to speak / neither could it be done without great reproach / that
many men beginning to speak / some should be bidden to hold their peace /
which would come to pass / if there should be no order kept / nor none to
appoint / when every one should speak or not / to put them to silence / when
they attempted confusedly to speak / and out of order. Moreover when many
ministers mete together / and in so great dyuersitie of gifts as the Lord
has given to his church / there be found that excel in memory / facility of
tongue / and expedition or quickness to dispatche matters more then the rest /
and therefore it is fit / that the brethren that have that dexterity /
should especially be preferred unto this office / that the action may be the
better / and more spedely made an end of.

And if any man will call this a rule or presidentship / and him that executes
this office a president or moderator / or a governor / we will not strive / so
that it be with these cautions / that he be not called simply governor or
moderator / but governor or moderator of that action / and for that time / and
subject to the orders that others be / and to be censured by the company of the
brethren / as well as others / if he be judged any way faulty. And that after
that action ended / and meeting dissolved / he sit him down in his old
place / and set him self in equal estate with the rest of the ministers.
Thirdly / that this government or presidentship / or what so ever like name you
will give it / be not so tied unto that minister / but that at the next meeting
it shall be lawful to take an other / if an other be thought meeter. Of this
order and policy of the church / if we will see a lively image and perfect
pattern / let us set before our eyes / the most ancient and gospel like church
that ever was or shall be.

In the acts / the church being gathered together for the election of an
Apostle into the place of Judas the traitor / when as the interest of election
belonged unto all / and to the apostles especially above the rest / out of the
whole company Peter rises up / tells the cause of their coming together /
with what 1. Act. 15.
cautions and qualities they ought to choose an other / conceyueth the prayer
whereby the help of God in that election / and his direction is begged / and no
doubt executed the residue of the things which pertayned unto the whole action.

In the second of the acts / all the Apostles are accused of drunkenness /
Peter answeareth for the^ all / wypeth away the infamy they were charged with.
But you will say / where are the voices of the rest / which did choose Peter
unto this. First / you must know that the scripture sets not down every
circumsta^ce / and then surely you do Peter great injury / that ask whether he
were chosen unto it. For is it to be thought / that Peter would thrust in him
self to this office or dignity without the consent and allowance of his
fellows / and prevent his fellows of this pre-eminence? undoubtedly / if it
had not been done arrogantly / yet it must needs have a great show of
arrogancye / if he had done this without the consent of his fellows. And
here you shall hear what the Scholiast says / which gathers the judgment
of Greek divines hora (speaking of Peter) panta meta koines auton gnomes
poiounta. Behold / how he does all with their common consent. And if any man
hereupon will say / that Peter exercised domination over the rest / or gate any
archapostleship / beside that ye whole story of the acts of the apostles / and
his whole course of life does refute that: the same Scholiast which I made
mention of in the same place / says he did nothing / archikos, imperiously /
nothing meta exousias, with domynion or power. Further / I will admonish him
to take heed / least if he strive so sore for the archbishop / he slide or
ever he be aware into the tents of the papists / which use these places to
prove that Peter had authority and rule over the rest of the apostles.

And that it may be understood / that this moderate rule / void of all
pomp and outward show / was not perpetual / nor always tied unto one man
(which were the last points of the cautions I put before) turn unto the 15.
of the Acts / where is showed / how with the rest of the church / the apostles
/ and amongst them Peter being assembled to decide a great controversy / James
the Act. 15. 13.
Apostle / and not Peter / moderated and governed the whole action / when as
after other had said their judgments / and namely Paul and Barnabas / and
Peter / he in the end / in the name of all / pronounced the sentence / and
that whereof the rest agreed / and had disputed unto / and the residue rested
in that judgment / the which also may likewise appear in the 21. of the
Acts. This is he which Act. 21. 20.
is called the bishop in every church / this is he also whom Justin whereof
mention is made afterward / calls proestos. And finally / this is that
great archbishoppricke / and great bishoppricke that M. Doctor so often
stumbleth on. This order and pre-eminence / the Apostles time / and those that
were near them kept / and the nearer they came to the apostles times / the
nearer they kept them to this order / and the farther of they were from those
times / until the discovering of the son of perdition / the further of were
they from this moderation / and nearer to that tyranny and ambitious power /
which oppressed and ouerlayde the church of God.

And therefore master Calvin does warely say / that one amongst the apostles
indefinitely / not any one singular person (as Peter) had the moderation and
rule of the other / and further shadoweth out what rule that was / by the
example of the consul of Rome / whose authority was / to gather the senate
together / and to tell of the matters which were to be handled / to gather ye
voices / to pronounce the sentence. And although the Antichrist of Rome had
perverted all good order / and taken all liberty of the church into his / the
Cardinals / Archbishops / and Bishops hands / yet there are some cold and
light footinges of it in our synodes / which are holden with the parliament /
where amongst all the mynisters which are assembled out of all the whole realm
/ by the more part of voices / one to chosen which should go before the rest /
propounde the causes / gather the voices / and be as it were the mouth of the
whole company / whom they term the prolocutor. Such great force has the
truth / that in the utter ruins of Popery / it could never be so pulled up by
the roots that a man could never know the place thereof no more / or that it
should not leave such marks and printes behind it / whereby it might
afterward recover it self / and come again to the knowledge of men.

Now you see what authority we allow amongst the ministers / both in their
several churches / or in provincial sinodes / or national / or general / or
what so ever other meetinges shall be advised of for the profit and edifying
of the church / and withal you see / that as we are far from this tyranny
and excessive power which now is in the church / so we are (by the grace of
God) as far from confusion and disorder / wherein you travel so much to make
us to seem guilty.

M. Doctor reasons again / that Paul an Apostle / and in the highest degree
of ministry / was superior to Timothe and Titus Evangelists / and so in a
lower degree of mynisterie / therefore one mynister is superior to an other /
one bishop to an other bishop / which are all one office / and one function. As
if I should say my Lord Mayor of London is above the sherifes / therefore one
sheriff is superior to an other. Again / an other argument he has of the same
strength. Titus being an Evangelist / was superior to all the pastors in Crete /
which was a degree under the Evangelists / therefore one pastor must be superior
unto an other pastor. And that he was superior / he proves because he had
authority to ordain pastors / so that the print of the archbishop is so
deeply set in his head / that hereof he can imagine nothing / but that Titus
should be archbishop of all Crete.

I have showed before / how these words are to be taken of S. Paul: and for so
much as M. Doctor burdeneth us with the authority of Calvin so often / I will
send him to Caluins own interpretation upon this place / where he shows ye
Titus did not ordain by his own authority / for s. Paul would not grant Titus
leave to do that / which he him self would not / and shows that to say that
Titus should make the election of pastors by him self / is to give unto him a
princely authority / and to take away the election from the church / and the
judgment of the insufficiency of the minister from the company of the pastors
/ which were (says he) to profane the whole government of the church.

I marvel therefore what M. doctor means to be so busy with M. Calvin / and
to seek confirmation of his archbishop and bishop at him / which would have
shaken at the naming of the one / and trembled at the office of the other /
onles it be because he would feign have his plaster where he received his
wound / but I dare assure him / that in his garden / he shall never find the
herb that will heal him. And because that the scriptures when they make for
our cause / receive this answer commonly / that they served but for the
apostles times / and M. Caluins authority will wey nothing as I think with M.
Doctor / when he is alleged by us against him / I will send him to the Greek
Scholiaste / which upon this place of Titus says after this sort. He would not
(speaking of s. Paul) have the whole I Will of Crete / ministered and governed by
one / but that every one should have his proper charge and care / for so should
Titus have a lighter labor / and the people that are governed / should enjoy
greater attendance of the pastor / whilst he that teaches them / does not run
about the government of many congregations / but attends unto one / and
garnisheth that.

Now M. Doctor may see by this / that Titus (by the judgment of the
Scholiaste) was not as he fansieth / the archbishop of all Crete / but that he
had one flock / whereupon (for the time he was there) he attended. And that
where it is said he ordained ministers / it is nothing else / but that he was
the chief and the moderator in the election of the ministers / as I have
declared before by many examples. And it is no marvel / although the rest
granted him this pre-eminence / when he had both most excellent gifts / and
was a degree above the pastors / being an Evangelist.

Unto the place of Timothe / where he wills him not to admit an accusation
against an elder under two or three witnesses / I answer as I have done before
to the place of Titus / that is / that as the ordination of the pastors is
attributed unto Titus and Timothe / because they governed and moderated that
action / and were the first in it / so also is the deposing or other censures
of them / and that for as much as he writes his epistles unto Timothe and
Titus / he tells them how they should behave them selves in their office /
and does not shut out other from this censure and judgment. And it is more
agreeable to the inscription of the epistles / that he should say (admit not
thou / or ordain not thou) writing unto one / then if he should say (ordain
not ye / or admit not ye) as if he should write to many / for so should neither
the ending agree with the beginning / nor the midst with them both. And if this
be a good rule / that because Paul bids Timothe and Titus to judge of the
faults of the pastors / and to ordain pastors / therefore none else did but
they: Then whereas S. Paul bids Timothe that 1. Tim. 4. 8. 1:
he should command and teach / that godliness is profitable to all things / and
admonishes him to be an example of the whole flock / by your reason he will
have no other of ye mynisters of Ephesus / or of the I Will of Creta / to teach
that doctrine / or to be examples to their flocks / and an hundredth such
things in the Epistles of Timothe and Titus / which although they be there
particularly directed unto Timothe / and Titus / yet do they agree / and are
common to them / with all other mynisters / yea sometimes unto the whole flock.

As for Epiphanius / it is known of what authority he is in this place / when
as by Aerius sides / he goes about to prick at the Apostle / whilst he goes
about to confute the Apostle which makes a distinction and difference between
those which the Apostle makes one / that is / a bishop and an elder / and to
spare the credit of Epiphanius / it were better lay that opinion upon some
Pseudepiphanius, that is to say counterfaite / which we may do / not without
great probability / seeing Ad quod vult Deum.
Augustine says / that the true Epiphanius utters all after a story fashion
/ and does not use any disputation / or reasoning for the truth against the
falshode / and this Epiphanius is very full of arguments and reasons / the
choice whereof M. Doctor has taken.

And whereas M. Doctor cites Ambrose / Calvin / and other godly writers / to
prove that the mynister is understood by the word elder or presbiter, he
keeps his old wont / by bringing sticks into the wood / and proving
always that which no man denies: and yet with the mynister of the word / he
also understands the elder of the church which rules / and does not labor in
the word. But therein is not the matter / for I do grant that by presbiter,
the mynister of the word is understood / and yet nothing proved of that which
M. Doctor would so feign prove. It is no marvel although you take up the
authors of the admonition for want of logic / for you utter great skill your
self in writing / which keep no order / but confound your reader in that
thing / which even the common logic of the country / which is reason / might
have directed you in. For what a confusion of times is this / to begin with
Cyprian / and then come to Jerome and Chrysostom / and after to the scripture
/ and back again to Ignatius / that was before Cyprian / which times are ill
disposed of you / and that in a matter wherein it stood you upon to have
observed the order of the times. But as for Ignatius place it is sufficiently
answered before in that which was answered to Cyprian his place / for when he
says the bishop has rule over all / he means no more all in the province /
then in all the world / but means that flock and congregation / whereof he
is bishop or mynister. And when he calls him prince of the priests /
although the title be to excessive and big / condemned by Cyprian and the
council of Carthage / yet he means no more the prince of all in the diocese
as we take it / or of the province / then he means the Prince of all the
priests in the world: but those fellow mynisters and elders that had the rule
and government of that particulare church and congregation / whereof he was
bishop / as the great churches have for the most part both elders which govern
only / and mynisters also to aid one an other / and the principality that he
which they called the bishop had over the rest / has been before at large
declared.

But M. Doctor does not remember that whilst he thus reasons for the
authority of the bishop / he overthrows his archbyshoppe quite and clean
/ for Ignatius will have none above the bishop but Christ / and he will have
an archbishop.

I see a man can not well serve two masters / but either he must displease the
one / and please the other / or by pleasing of one / offend the other. For M.
Doctor would feign please / and uphold both / and yet his proufes are such /
that every prop that he sets under one / is an axe to strike at the other.
But that M. D. delyteth always where he might fetch at ye fountain / to be
raking in ditches / he needed not to have gone to Justin Martyr for Proestos,
when as S. Paul 1. Tim. 5. 17.
calls the mynisters and Elders by this title. And if this place of Justin
make for an archbishop / then in stead of an archbishop in every province / we
shall have one in every congregation. For Justin declares there / the Leyturgie
or manner of serving God that was in every church used of the Christians. And I
pray you let it be considered / what is the office of that proestos, and see
whether there be any resemblance in the world / between him and an archbishop.
For he places his office to be in preaching / in conceiving prayers / in
mynistring of the sacraments. Of any commandment which he had over the rest
of the mynisters / or of any such privileges as the archbishop has / he
makes not one word. It may be / that the same might have the pre-eminence of
calling the rest together / and propounding the matter to the rest of the
company / and such like as is before declared. As soon as ever you found
proestos, you snatched that by and by / and went your ways / and so deceive
your self and others. But if you had red the whole treatise / you should have
found that he was proestos, of the people / for thus it is written in the same
Apology / Epeita prospheretai to Proestoti ton adelphon artos. Afterward
bread is brought to the president of the brethren calling the people as S.
Paul does continually brethren. And therefore these are M. Doctors arguments
out of Martyrs place. There was a mynister which did stand before / or was
president of the rest in every particulare church and congregation / therefore
there was an archbyshoppe over all the province. And again / there was one
which ruled the people in every congregation / therefore there was one that
ruled all the mynisters through out the whole province. And albeit things were
in great purity in the days that Justin lived / in respect of the times which
followed / yet as there was in other things (which appear in his works / and
even in the ministration of the sacraments spoken of in that place) corruption
/ in that they mingled water and wine together / so even in the ministry /
there began to peep out some thing which went from the simplicity of the
gospel / as that the name of proestos, which was common to the elders with the
ministers of the word / was (as it seems) appropriated unto one.

Another of M. Doctors reasons / for to prove the archbishop / is / that Cyrill
makes mention of an high priest / whereunto I answer / that he that brings
in a priest into the church / goes about to bury our savior Christ / for
although it might be proved that the word priest were the same with the
Greeks presbyteros, yet (as shall appear in his place) is the use of this
word (priest) for a mynister of the gospel very dangerous. And as for him
that brings in an high priest into the church / he goes about to put our
savior Christ out of his office / who is proved in the Epistle to the Hebrews
to be the only high priest / and Hebru. 7.
that there can be no more as long as the world endures. And yet if all this
were granted / you are not yet come to that which you desire to prove / that
is / an archbyshoppe. For if you look in Theodorete / you shall find this
word 1. Lib. 3. cap.
archierosyne, which signifies the high priesthood / to be nothing else but
a byshoppricke / and in the. 7. chapter of that book / and so forth diverse
times / you shall have archiereus, taken for a bishop / as speaking of the
council of Nice / he says that there was. 318. archiereis, high priests. Now
I think you will not say there were. 318. archbyshops. If you do / you are
confuted by all ecclesiastical writers that ever I red / which speaking of
them / call them bishops.

Chrysostom follows / which as M. Doctor says / ruled not only the church
of Constantinople / but the churches of Thracia / Asia / and Pontus / and he
says it out of Theodorete. But heerin it may appear / that either M. Doctor
has a very evil conscience in falsifying writers / and that in the points
which he in controversy / or else he has taken his stuff of certain at the
second hand without any examination of it at all. For here he has set down
in stead of (had care of the churches in Thracia. etc.) ruled the churches /
the Greek is / epoieito ten promethcian, it is translated also (prospexit) so
that it appears he fetched it neither from Theodorite in Greek nor in
Latin. And what is this to prove an archbyshoppe / that he had care of these
churches? there is no minister but ought to have care over all the churches
through christendom / and to show that care for them / in comforting or
admonishing of them by writing / or by visiting them / if the necessity so
require / and it be thought good by the churches / and leave obtained of the
place where he is mynister / upon some notable and especial cause / being
some man of singular gifts / whose learning and credit may profit much to
the bringing to pass of that thing / for the which he is to be sent. After
this sort * S. Cyprian being in Affricke / had care over Rome in Europe / and
wrote As it appears by diverse epistles of his. Eusebius. lib. 5. cap. 3. and 4.
unto the church there. After this sort also was * Ireneus bishop of Lions /
sent by the French churches unto the churches in Phrigia. And after this sort
have M. Calvin / and M. Beza been sent from Geneua in Sauoy / to the churches
of France.

Now / if you will conclude hereupon / that Cyprian ruled the church of Rome
/ or Ireneus the churches of Phrigia / or master Calvin / or M. Beza the
churches of France / or that they were bishops or archbyshops of those places
/ you shall but conclude as you were wont to do / but yet all men understand /
that here is nothing less then an archbishop / or any such bishop / as we
have and use in our church. And if so be that Chrysostom should be bishop or
archbishop of al these churches which were in all Asia / Pontus / Thracia / as
you would give the reader to understand / you make him bishop of more churches /
then ever the Pope of Rome was / when he was in his greatest pride / and his
Empire largest. For there were six presidentships in Thracia / and in Asia
there were a eleven Princes / and had several regions or gouernmentes / and in
Pontus as many / and if he were bishop or archbishop of all the churches within
these dominions / he had need of a long spone to feed with all. It is
certain therefore / that he was bishop only of the church in Constantinople /
and had an eye and a care to those other churches. And that he was bishop of
one city / or of one church / it may appear by that which I have before
alleged out of the Greek Scholiaste upon Titus / who cites there
Chrysostom / where it is said that S. Paul did not mean to make one over the
whole I Will / but that every one should have his proper congregation. etc. * And
in an other place he shows the difference 3. hom. act. 6.
between the Emperor and the bishop / that the one is over the world / and
the other that is the bishop / is over one city.

Touching Theodorete bishop of Cyrus / to let pas that which the bishops of
Egypt cried in the council of Calcedon / that he was no bishop / it is to be
observed / In the 1. act. In the same act.
that which the Emperoures Theodosius and Valentinian / write unto Dioscorus
bishop of Alexandria / that he had commanded Theodoret bishop of Cyrus / that
he should keep him self unto his own church only: whereby it appears / that
he meddled in more churches then was mete he should. Besides / that wants not
suspicion ye he speaks this of him self / especially when he says / ye
there was not in all those. 800. churches one tare / ye is / one hypocrite or
evil man.

Now / that it may appear what great lykelyhoode there is between this
Theodoret / and our Lord bishops and archbyshops / it is to be considered which
he writes of him self in the Epistle unto Leo / that is / that he having
been. 26. years bishop / was known of all that dwelt in those parts / that
he had never house of his own / nor field / nor halfepennie / not so much as a
place to be buried in / but had willingly contented him self with a poor
estate / belyke he had a very lean archbyshoppricke. And if the fat morsels of
our byshopprickes and archbishopprickes / were taken and employed to their uses
of maintenance of the pore / and of the mynisters / and of the universities /
which are the seed of the mynisterie / I think the heat of the disputation
/ and contention for archbyshops and bishops / would be cooled.

Now good reader thou hear what M. Doctor has been able to take together
out of the old fathers / which he says are so plain in this matter / and yet
can show nothing to the purpose. Hear also what he says out of the writers of
our age / all which he says (except one or two) are of his judgment / and
allow well of this distinction of degrees.

Master Calvin first is cited / to prove those offices of archbishop / primate
/ patriarche / the names whereof he can not abide / and as for him he approves
only / that there should be some * which when difficult causes arise / which
can not be ended in the particulare churches might refer the matters to
sinodes and provincial councels and which might do the offices which I have
spoken of before of gathering voices. etc.

But that he lyketh not of those dominations and large jurisdictions or at all
of the bishops or archbyshops / which we have now / it may appear plainly
enough / both in that place / when as he will have his words drawn to no
other then the old bishops / shutting out thereby the bishops that now are
/ as also in other places / and namely upon the Philippians / where (reasoning
against Chap. 1.
this distinction between pastor and bishop / and showing that giving the name
of bishop to one man only in a church / was the occasion why he afterward
usurped domynation over the rest) he says after this sort: In deed I grant
(says he) as the dispositions and manners of men are / order can not stand
amongst the mynisters of the word / unless one be over the rest / I mean
(says he) of every several and singular body / not of a whole province / much
less of the whole world.

Now if you will needs have M. Caluins archbishop / you must not have him
neither over a province nor diocese / but only over one singular and particular
congregation. How much better therefore were it for you to seek some other
shelter against the storm then master Caluins / which will not suffer you by
any means to cover your self under his wings / but thrusts you out always
as soon as you enter upon him forceably.

But here I can not let pass M. Doctors ill dealing / which recyting so much
of master Calvin / cutteth him of in the waste and leaves quite out that
which made against him / that is which master Calvin ^ayth in these words:
Although (says he) in this disputacion / it may not be passed over / that this
office of archbishop or patriarch was most rarely and seldom used / which
dealing seems to proceed of a very evil conscience.

Then follows Hemingius / who you say approves these degrees of archbishop /
metropolitan / bishop / archdeacon / for so you must needs mean / when you
say he approves these degrees / or else you say nothing / for there upon is the
question. Now how untruly you speak (let it be judged by that which
follows. * First he says that our savior Christ in S. Luke distinguishes
and puts c. 10. 3. clas. lib. Enchirid. where also among the popish orders /
he reckneth the archb.
a difference / between the office of a Prince and the office of the minister
of the church / leaving domynion to the Princes / and taking it altogether from
the mynisters. Here you see / not only how he is against you in your exposition
in the place of S. Luke / which would have it nothing else but a prohibition of
ambition / but also how at a word / he cutteth the throat of your archbishop
and bishop / as it is now used. And afterward speaking of ye churches of
Denmark / he says they have Christ for their head and for the outward
discipline / they have magistrates to punish with the sword / and for to
exercise the Ecclesiastical disciplyne / they have bishops / pastors / doctors
/ which may keep men under with the word / without using any corporal
punishment. Here is no mention of archbyshops / Primates metropolitanes. And
although he shows that they keep the distinction between bishops and
ministers / against which there has been before spoken: yet he says that the
authority which they have / is as the authority of a father / not as the power
of a master / which is far otherwise here. For the condition of many
servant under their masters / is much more free then the condition of a
minister under his bishop. And afterward he shows wherein that authority or
dignity of the bishop over the minister lies / that is in exhorting of him /
in chiding of him / as he does the lay people / and yet he will have also the
minister / although not with such authority / after a modest sort to do the
same unto the bishop. And so he concludes / that they retain these orders /
notwithstanding the anabaptists. Now let the reader judge / whether Hemingius
be truly or faithfully alleged or no / or whether Hemingius do say that they
have in their church archbishops / primates / metropolitanes / archdeacons / or
whether the bishops in the churches of Denmark / are any thing like ours. For
I will omit that he speaks there against all pomp in the ministry / all
worldly superiority or highness / because I love not to write out whole pages /
as M. Doctor does out of other men's wrytings / to help to make up a book.

M. doctor closes up this matter with M. Fox / but either for fear that the
place should be found that there might be answer / or for fear that M. Fox
should give me the solution which has given you the objection / he would
neither quote the place of the book / nor the book it self / he having written
diverse. You ca^ not speak so much good of M. Fox / which I will not willingly
subscribe unto. And if it be any declaration of good will and of honor / that
one bears to an other / to read that which he writes / I think I have red
more of him / then you. For I have red over his book of Martyrs / and so I
think did never you. For if you had red so diligently in M. Fox / as you have been hasty to snatch at Page 78. of the book of Act.
this place / he would have taught you the forgery of these Epistles / whereout
you fetch your authorities / and would have showed you that the distinguishing
of the orders of metropolitanes / bishops / and other degrees / which you say
sometimes had their beginnings in the apostles times / sometimes you can not
tell when / were not in Higinus time / which was a. 180. years after Christ. I
perceive you fear M. Fox is an ennemy unto your archbishop and primate / and
therefore it seems you went about to corrupt him with his praise / and to
seek to draw him / if it were possible / unto the archbishop / and if not /
yet at the least that he would be no ennemy / if he would not / nor could not
be his friend. You make me suspect that your praise is not hearty / but pretended
/ because you do so often and so bitterly speak against all those that will
not receive the cap and surplice / and other ceremonies / whereof M. Fox
declares his great misliking. For answer unto ye place / because I remember it
not / nor mean not to read over ye whole book to seek it / I say first as I
said before / that there may be some thing before or after / which may give the
solution to this place / especially seeing M. Fox in another place / proving
the 1. Tom. Act. page 96.
Epistles of Stephanus to be counterfeit / he uses this reason: because the
fifthe Canon of the said Epistles / solemnly entreats of the difference
between primates / metropolitanes / and archbyshops / which distinction (says
he) of titles and degrees / savor more of ambition the^ persecution. Moreover I
say / that M. Fox writing a story / does take greater pain / and looks more
diligently to declare what is done / and in what time / and by whom / then how
justly or unjustly / how conveniently or inconueniently it is done. Last of all
/ if any thing be spoken there to the hinderance of the sincerity of the
gospel / I am well assured that M. Fox / which has travailed so much and so
profitably to that end / will not have his authority or name therein to bring
any prejudice. Now will I also wine with you / and leave it to the judgment of
the indifferent reader / how well out of the scriptures / councels / writers
old and new / you have proved either the lawfulnes at all of the names of
archbishops / patriarchs / archdeacons / primates / or of the lawfulnes of the
office of them / and of bishops which be in our times.

And for as much as I have purposed to answer in one place / that which is
scattered in diverse / I will here answer half a shete of paper / which is
annexed of late unto this book put forth in the name / and under the credit
of the B. of Salisbury. Wherein I will say nothing of those biting and sharp
words / which are given partly in the beginning / when he calls the
propounders of the proposition which concerns archbyshops and archdeacons
nouices / partly in the end when he calls them children / and the doctrine of
the gospel wantonness. etc. If he had lived / for his learning and grauitye /
and otherwise good deserts of the church / in defending the cause thereof
against the papists / we could have easily borne it at his hands: now he is
dead and laid up in peace / it were against all humanitye to dygge or to
break up his grave / only I will leave it to the consideration of the reader
upon those things which are alleged / to judge / whether it be any wantonness
or noueltye which is confirmed by so grave testimonies of the ancient word of
God. Unto the place of the. 4. of the Ephesians before alleged / he answeareth
clean contrary to that which M. Doctor says / that we have now neither
Apostles / nor Evangelists / nor Prophets / whereupon he would conclude that
that place is no perfect pattern of the ministry in the church. In deed it is
true / we have not / neither is it needful that we should. It was therefore
sufficient that there were once / and for a time / so that the want of those
now / is no cause why the minysteries there recited / be not sufficient for
the accomplyshment and full fynishing of the church / nor cause why any other
minysteries should be added / besides those which are there recyted.

Afterward he says / that neither bishop nor elder are reckned in that place.
The pastor is there reckened up / and I have showed / that the pastor and
bishop / are all one / and are but diverse names to signifye one thing. And as
for those elders which do only govern / they are made mention of in other
places / the apostles purpose being to reckon up here only / those minysteries
/ which are conversant in the word as I have before alleged / and therefore
the bishop and elder which with government teach also are there contained.

After that / he says there is no catechista, if there be a pastor / or as
some think Doctor / there is one which both can / and ought to instruct the
youth / neither does it pertayne to any other in the church / and publykely to
teach the youth in the rudiments of religion / then unto either the pastor or
doctor / how so ever in some times and places / they have made a several
office of it.

And where he says that there is neither deacon nor reader mentioned / for the
deacon I have answered that s. Paul speaks there only of those functio^s
which are occupied both in teaching and gouernyng the churches / and therefore
there was no place there to speak of a deacon / and as for the reader / it is
no such office in the church / which the minister may not do. And if either
he have not leisure / or his strength and voice will not serve him / first to
read some long time / and afterward to preach: it is an easy matter to
appoint some of the elders or deacons / or some other grave man in the church
to that purpose / as it has been practiced in the churches in times past /
and is in the churches reformed in our days without making any new order or
office of the ministry. Where he says / that by this reason we should have no
churches / pulpits / schools / nor universities: it is first easily answered
that S. Paul speaks not in the. 4. to the Ephesians / of all things
necessary for the church / but only of all necessary ecclesiastical functions
/ which do both teach and govern in the church / and then I have already
showed that there were both churches and pulpits.

As for schools and universities / it is sufficient commandment of them / in
that it is commanded / that both the magistrates and pastors should be
learned / for he that commands that they should be learned / commands
those things and those means / whereby they may most conveniently come to that
learning. And we have also examples of them commended unto us in the old
Testament. As in the book of the Judges / when Debora commends the university
Judges. 5. 14.
men / and those which handled the pen of the writer / that they came out to
help in the battle against the enemies of God. And in the book of Samuel /
and of the 1. Sam. 19. 19 2. reg. 2. 3. 5. 7.
Kings / where Nayothe and Bethel / Ierycho / and a place beyond Jordan / are
specified places / which were schools or universities / where the scholars of
the Prophets / were brought up in the fear of God / and good learning. The
continuance of which schools and universities amongste the people of God /
may be easily gathered of that which S. Luke writes in the Acts / where it
may appear Acts. 6. 9.
that in Jerusalem there were certain Colleges appointed for several country
men / so that there was one College to receive the Jews and Proselites which
came out of Cilicia / an other for those yt came out of Alexandria. etc. to
study at Jerusalem. And if any man be able to show such evidence for
archbyshops and archdeacons / as these are for universities and schools / I will
not deny but it is as lawful to have them / as these.

Furthermore / he says that the church is not governed by names / but by
offices: so is it in deed. And if the office of an archbishop or archdeacon
can be showed / we will not strive for the name / but for so much as all the
needful offices of the church together with their names / are mentioned in the
scripture / it is truly said / that both the offices and names of archbishop
and archdeacon / (being not only not contained in them / but also condemned)
ought to be banished out of the church.

Last of all / he says / that Anacletus (if there be any weight in his words)
names an archb. I have before showed what waighte there is in his words /
and I refuse not that he be weighed with the bishops own weightes / which he
gives us in the handling of the article of the supremacye / and in the. 223.
and 224. pages / by the which waightes appears / that this Anacletus is not
only light / but a plain counterfeit.

The second reason which says that the church of God under the law / had
all things needful appointed by the commandment of God / the bishop says
he knows not what could be concluded of it. I have showed before that there
is nothing les meant / then that the church under the gospel / should have all
those things that that church had / or should have nothing / which that had
not: but this thereupon is concluded / that the Lord which was so careful for
that / as not to omit the least / would not be so careless for this church under
the gospel / as to omit the greatest.

And where he says / that there was then which was called high priest / and
was over all the rest: he did well know that the cause thereof was / because he
was a figure of Christ / and did represent unto the people / the cheefetye and
superioritye of our savior Christ which was to come / and that our
savior Christ being come / there is now no cause why there should be any
such pre-eminence given unto one: and further / that it is unlawful that there
should be any such / unless it be lawful to have one head* bishop over all
the church. For it is known / that that priest was the head priest over all
the whole Church / which was during his time unto our savior Christ. And as
for those titles / chief of the sinagogue / chief of the sanctuary / chief
of the house of God / I say that that makes much against archbyshoppes and
archdeacons / for when as in stead of the sinagogue / and of the sanctuary /
and of the house of God or Temple / are come particulare churches and
congregations / by this reason it follows / that there should be some chief
/ not in every province or diocese / but in every congregation: and in deed so
ought there to be certain chief in every congregation / which should govern
and rule the rest. And as for the chief of the families of the Levites / and
chief of the families of the priests / the same was observed in all other
tribes of Israel as a civil thing. And by all these princes over every tribe
and family / as by the Prince of the whole land / God did / as it were by
diverse lively pictures unprint in their understanding / the cheefety and
domination of our savior Christ. Moreover these orders and policies touching
the distribution of the offices of the Levites and priests / and touching the
appointment of their governors / were done of David by the advice of the
prophets / Gad and Nathan / which received of the Lord by commandment / that
which they deluiered 2. Chro. 29. 25
to David. And if so be that it can be showed / that archbyshops and
archdeacons / came into the church by any commandment of the Lord / then this
allegation has some force / but now being not only not commanded / but also
(as I have showed) forbidden / every man does see that this reason has no
place / but serves to the utter overthrow of the archbishop and archdeacon.
For if David being such a notable personage / and as it were an angel of God /
durst not take upon him to bring into the church any orders or policies / not
only not against the word of God / but not without a precise word and
commandment of God / who shall dare to be so bold / as to take upon him the
institution of the chief office of the church / and to alter the policy that
God has established by his servants the apostles?

And where the bishop says / it is known and confessed / that there wanted
many things to ye perfection of the church of the Jews: truly I do not know /
nor can not confess / that that church wanted any thing to the perfection of
that estate / which the Lord would have them be in / until the coming of our
savior Christ: and if there were any thing wanting / it was not for want of
good laws and policies / (whereof the question is /) but for want of due
execution of them / which we speak not of.

For the two last reasons against the archbishop and archdeacon / although I be
well acquainted with diverse / that favor this cause / yet I did never hear
them before in my life: and I believe they cannot be proved to be his reasons /
whose they are supposed to be / and which did set down that proposition / that
the bishop confuteth. Notwithstanding / the former of these two seems to have
a good probability / and to be grounded of that place of Logic / that shows
/ that according as the subject or substance of any thing is excellent / so are
those things that are annexed and adjoined unto it. But because I would the
simplest should understand what is said or written / I will willingly abstain
from such reasons / the terms whereof are not easily perceived / but of those
which be learned.

And as for the answer which the bishop makes / that in place of apostles /
prophets / the gifts of tongues / of healing / and of government / are brought
in universities / schools / bishops / and archbyshops: for schools and
universities / I have showed / they have been always / and therefore can not
come in / to supply the room of the apostles and prophets. And whether a man
consider the scholars that learn / or the scholemaisters which teach / or the
orders appointed for the government of the schools / they shall be found to be
rather civil then ecclesiastical: and therefore can not come in stead of any
ecclesiastical ministry. If the bishop do mean that they come in place of
the gift of tongues / and knowledge of the gospel that was first given
miraculously / I grant it / and then it makes nothing to this question.

As for bishops / they can not come in place of apostles or prophets / for as
much as they were when the Apostles / Evangelists / and Prophets were: and are
one of those ministeries / which S. Paul mentions in the. 4. to the Ephesians
/ being the same that is the pastor.

There remains therefore the archbishop / which if he came in place of the
Prophets and apostles (as the bishop says) how comes it to pas / that the
bishop says by and by out of the authority of Erasmus / that Titus was an
archbishop: for at that time / there was both apostles / prophets / and
Evangelists. If it be so therefore / that the archbishop must supply the want of
apostles. etc. how comes it to pas / he wayteth not his time whilst they
were dead / but comes in / like unto one which is borne out of time / and
like the untimely and hasty fruit / which is seldom or never wholesome. And
for one to come into the apostles or prophets place / requires the authority
of him which ordained the apostles. etc. which is the Lord / and his
institution in his word / which is that which we desire to be showed. But
hereof I have spoken before at large. The necessity of Deanes I do not
acknowledge / and I have already spoken of them. Touching Prebendaries / I
shall have occasion to speak a word hereafter. For Earls and Dukes / and
such like titles of honor / they are civil / neither does it follow / that
because there may new titles or new offices be brought into the civil
government / that therefore the same may be attempted in the church. For God
has left a greater liberty in instituting things in the common wealth / then
in the church.

For / for so much as there be diverse common wealths / and diverse forms of
common wealths / and all good / it falls out / that the offices and
dignityes which are good in one common wealth / are not good in an other / as
those which are good in a Monarchy / are not good in Aristocratie / and those
which are good in Aristocratie / are not good in a populare state. But that can
not be said of the church / which is but one and uniform / and has the
same laws and form of government throughout the world.

In common wealths also there are conuersions / one form being changed into an
other / which can not be in the true church of God. As for Erasmus authority
which says that Titus was an archbishop / I have answered to it. And whereas
Chrysostom says / that the judgment of many bishops was committed to Titus
/ I have declared in what sort that is to be understood / and yet upon those
words / the bishop can hardly conclude / that which he does: that Titus had the
government of many bishops. For it is one thing to say / the judgment of many
was committed unto Titus / and an other thing to say / that he had the
government of many.

The answer of the bishop unto the fourth supposed reason / pertains unto an
other question / that is whether ecclesiastical persons / ought to exercise
civil jurisdiction / whereunto I will answer by Gods grace / when I come to
speak upon occasion of M. Doctors book of that question. In the mean season I
will desire the reader to consider / what weak grounds the archbishop and
archdeacon stand upon / seeing that the bishop of Sarum / being so learned a
man / and of so great reading / could say no more in their defense / which
notwythstanding in the controversies against D. Harding / is so pithy and so
plentiful.

Now I have showed how little those things which M. doctor brings / make for
proof of that wherefore he alleges them: I will for the better understanding
of the reader / set down what were ye causes why the archbishops were first
ordained / and what were their prerogatives / and prehemine^ces before other
bishops / and the estate also of the old bishops / which lived in those times /
wherein although there were great corruptions / yet the church was in some
tolerable estate / to the intent it may appear / partly how little need we
have of them now / and partly also how great difference there is between
ours and them. Of the names of Metropolitan / it has been spoken / how that
he should not be called the chief of priests / or the high priest / or bishop
of bishops: now I will set down his office and power which he had / more
then the bishops.

In the council of Antioche it appears / that the bishop of the
metropolitan Chap. 9.
seat / called Synodes / and propounded the matters which were to be handled.
etc. the archbishop does not now call Synodes / but the Prince does / for as
much as there is no convocation without a parliament / and he does not propound
the matters / and gather the voices / but an other chosen / which is called
prolocutor / therefore in ye respect that an archb. and metropolitan was first
ordained / we have no need of an archb. or metropolitan. Again / an other
cause also appears there / which was to see that the bishops kept them
selves within their own dioceses / and brake not into an others diocese. But
first this may be done without an archbishop / and then it is not done of the
archb. (him self giving licenses unto the wandering ministers to go throughout
not so few as a dosen dioceses) therefore the office of an archb. is not
necessary in this respect / and if it were / yet it must be other then it is
now.

Again / the cause why the metropolitan differed from the rest / and why
Chap. 9.
the calling of the Synod was given to him / as it appears in the same
counsel / was for that the greatest concourse was to that place / and most
assembly of men / whereunto also may be added / for that there was the best
commodity of lodging and of vitailing / and for that / as it appears in other
councels / it was the place and seat of the Empire. But with us neither the
greatest concourse nor assemblye of men / nor the greatest commodity of lodging
and vitailing / neither yet the seat of the kingdom is in the metropolitan
city / therefore with us there is no such cause of a metropolitan or
archbishop.

In the council of Carthage / holden in Cyprians time / it appears that no
bishop had authority over an other / to compel an other / or to condemn an
other / but every bishop was left at his own liberty to answer unto God / and
to make his account unto Christ: and if any thing were done against any bishop
/ it was done by the consent of all the bishops in the province / or as many as
could conveniently assemble. Therefore Cyprian / which was the metropolitan
bishop / had then no authority over the rest / and yet then (there being no
christian magistrate / which would punish the disorders which were committed
of the christian bishops) there was greatest need / that there should have
been some one / which might have had the correction of the rest. If therefore
when there was most need of this absolute authority / there neither was /
nor might be any such / it follows that now we have a Christian magistrate
/ which may and ought to punish the disorders of all Ecclesiastical persons
/ and may and ought to call them to accoumpt for their faults / that there
should be no such need of an archbishop.

The moderation of their authority in the ancient times may appear / first by
a Canon which is falsely given to the apostles / being as it is like a Canon of
the council of Antioche / wherein although it ordains one primate in every
nation 34. canon.
over the rest / and will not suffer any great matter to be done without him /
as also will not suffer him to do any thing without the rest / yet every B.
might do that / which appertained unto his own parish / without him / and he
nothing to do with him in it. But as it seems / the meaning of the Canon was
/ that if there were any weighty matter to be concluded for all the churches in
the nation / then the bishops of every parish should not enterprise any thing
without calling him to counsel. Now we see that the archb. medleth with that
which every bishop does in his own diocese / and has his visitations for that
purpose / and will take any matter out of their hands / concludes also of
diverse matters / never making the bishops once privy to his doings.

Higinus / or as some think Pelagius (I speak here as Platina reports
Platina cap. Higin.
not thincking that in Higinus time / there was any Metropolitan) ordained
that no Metropolitan should condemn any bishop / onles the matter were first
both hard and discussed by the bishops of that province / at what time /
and after a great while / a bishop was the same we call a minister. Now the
archbishop will without any further assistance or discussion by others suspend
him / and in the end also throw him out of his charge / and if he have the
same authority over a bishop / as a bishop over the minister (as it is said) he
may do the like unto him also.

The council of Antioche ordained / that if the voices of the bishops were
Canon. 17.
even / and that if half did condemn him / and half clear him / that then
the metropolitan bishop should call of the next province some other bishops
/ which should make an end of the controversy. Whereby appears that the
Metropolitan had so small authority and power over and above the rest / that
he had not so much as the casting voice / when both sides were even / and
therefore it appears / that besides the names of metropolitan / there was
little or no resemblance between those that were then / and those which be now.

Now / to consider how the bishops which are now / differ from the bishops
which were in times past / I must call to thy remembrance (gentle reader) that
which I have spoken before / which was that then there was / as appears out
of Cyprian and Jerome / and others / one bishop in every parish or
congregation: now one is over a thousand / then every bishop had a several
church where he preached and ministered the sacraments: now he has none / then
he ruled that one church (as I showed out of Jerome) in common with the
Elders of the same: now he rules a thousand by him self / shutting out the
ministers / to whom the rule and government belongs / then he ordained not
any minister of the church / except he were first chosen by the presbiterie,
and approved by the people of that place whereunto he was ordained: now he
ordains where there is no place void / and of his private authority /
without either choice or approbation of presbytery or people: then he
excommunicated not / nor received the excommunicated / but by sentences of the
eldership / and consent of the people / as shall appear afterward: now he
does both.

And thus you see that contrary to the word of God / he has gotten into his
own hand / and pulled to him self / both the pre-eminence of the other
ministers / and the liberties of the church / which God by his word had given.
And Hispal. Council. can. 7.
as for the offices wherein there is any labor or travail / those they have
turned unto the other ministers / as for example in times past it was not
lawful for him that was then an elder / to preach or minister the sacraments
in the presence of the bishop / because the bishop him self should do it / and
now those which they call elders / may preach and minister the sacraments by
the bishops good license / although he be present.

Now if you will also consider how much the Lordship / pomp / and statelines
of the bishops in our days / differ from the simplicity of them in times past
/ I will give you also a taste thereof / if first of all I show the beginning
/ or as it were the fountain whereupon the pomp grew / which was / when in
stead of having a bishop in every parish and congregation / they began to
make a bishop of a whole diocese / and of a thousand congregations.

In an epistle of acharie unto Pope Boniface / it is thus written: it has
Council. tom. 3. epi. zach. papae ad Bonif.
been oftentimes decreed / that there should not be a bishop appointed in
every village or little city / least they should wax vile through the
multitude: whereby it both appears / that there was wont to be a bishop in
every parish / and upon how corrupt and evil consideration one bishop was
set over a whole diocese. No doubt those that were authoures of this / had
learned too well our old proverb / the fewer the better cheer / but the more
bishops the meryer it had been with Gods people. And they might with as good
reason hinder the sun from shining in all places / and the rain from falling
upon al grounds / for fear they should not be set by / being common / as to
bring in such a wicked decree / whereby under pretense of delivering the bishop
from contempt / they sought nothing else but an ambitious and stately Lordshyp
over those which had not that title of bishop that they had / although they
did the office of a bishop better then they did. And what intolerable
presumption is this / to change the institution of God / as though he which
ordained not one only / but some number more or les of bishops in every church
/ did not sufficiently foresee / that the multitude and plentye of bishops
could breed no contempt of the office. And it may be as well ordained that
the children of pore men should not call them that begat them / fathers and
mothers / but only the children of the rich / and of noble / least that if
every man that has children / should be called a father / fathers should be
set nothing by. And here let us observe by what degrees and stairs Satan
lifted the child of perdition unto that proud title of universal bishop.
First / where the Lord did ordain that there should be diverse pastors /
elders / or bishops in every congregation / Satan wrought first that there
should be but one in every church: this was no doubt the first step.
Afterward he pushed further / and stirred up diverse not to content them
selves to be bishops of one church / but to desire to be bishops of a diocese /
whereunto although it seems that there was resistance (in that it is said that
it was decreed often) yet in the end this wicked attempt prevailed / and this
was an other step. Then were there archbishops of whole provinces / which was
the third stayer unto the seat of antichriste. Afterward they were Patriarks
of one of the.iiij. corners of the whole world / the whole church being
assigned to the jurisdiction of four / that is to say of the Roman /
Constantinopolitane / Antiochene / and Alexandrine bishops. And these four
stayers being laid of Satan / there was but an easy stride for the B. of Rome
/ into that chair of pestilence / wherein he now sits. Having now showed
how this Lordly estate of the bishop began / and upon what a rotten ground it
is builded / I come to show how far the bishops in our time are / for their
pomp and outward statelines / degenerated from the bishops of elder times.

And here I call to remembrance / that which was spoken of the poor estate
of Basile and Theodorete: and if M. Doctor will say (as he does in deed in a
certain place) that the^ was a time of persecution / and this is a time of
peace: it is easily answered / that although Basil were under persecution /
yet Theodorete lived under good emperors. But that shall appear better by the
Canons / which were rules given for the bishops to frame them selves by.

In the. 4. council of Carthage it is decreed / that the bishops should have
14. canon. It calls it hospitiolum. 15. canon.
a little house near unto the church: what is this compared with so many fair
large houses / and with the princely palace of a bishop? And in the same
council it is decreed that he should have the furniture and stuff of his
house after the commen sort / and that his table and diet should be pore / and
that he should get him estimation by faithfulness and good conversation.

And in an other council / that the bishops should not give them selves to 5.
canon. Council. Tyronensis.
feasts / but be content with a little meat. Let these bishops be compared
with ours / whose chambers shine with gilt / whose walls are hanged with
clothes of Auris / whose cupbordes are laden with plate / whose tables and
diets are furnished with multitude and diversity of dishes / whose daily
dinners are feasts: Let them I say be compared together / and they shall be
found so unlike / that if those old bishops were alive / they would not know
each other. For they would think that ours were princes / and ours would
think that they were some hedge priests / not worthy of their acquaintance or
fellowshyp.

In the same council of Carthage / it was decreed / that no bishop sitting 34.
canon.
in any place / should suffer any minister or elder to stand. Now I will
report me to themselves how this is kept / and to the pore ministers which have
to do with them / and come before them.

The bishops in times past had no tail nor train of men after them / and
thought it a slander to the gospel to have a number of men before and behind
them. And therefore is Paulus Sam of atenus noted as one that brought relygion
Eusebius. lib. 7. c. 30.
into hatred / and as one that seemed to take delight rather to be a captain
of two hundredth / then a bishop / because he had gotten him a sort of serving
men to weight on him. An other example not unlike and likewise reprehended is
in Ruffine of one Gregory a bishop. Now in our days it is thought a
commendation Ruf. 1. lib. cap. 23.
to the bishop / a credit to the gospel / if a bishop have 30. 40. 60. or more
waiting of him / some before some behind / whereof three parts of them (set
apart the carrying of a dishe unto the table) have no honest or profitable
calling to occupy themselves in two hours of the day / to ye filling of the
church and commo^wealth also with all kind of disorders and greater
incommodities / then I mind to speak of / because it is not my purpose.

And here I will note an other cause / which brought in this pomp and
princely estate of bishops / wherein although I will say more in a word for
the pompeous estate / then M. Doctor has done in all his treatise / yet I will
show that although it were more tolerable at the first / now it is by no
means to be borne with. * In the ecclesiastical story we read that the
inscriptions of diverse Theo. li. 5. c. 8.
epystles sent unto bishops were timiotatois kyriois. We read also of
aspasticon oicon house of salutations / which Ambrose bishop of Millain had. As
for the title Li. eodem. cap. 18.
of (most honorable Lords) it was not so great nor so stately as the name of a
Lord or knight in our country / for all those that know the manner of the speech
of the Grecians do well understand / how they used to call every one of any
mean countenance in the common wealth where he lived kyrion / that is Lord /
so we see also the Evangelists use the word Kyrios to note a mean person as
when Mary in the. 20. of John / thinking that our savior Christ had been the
keeper of the garden calls him (Kyrion). So likewise in France they call
every one that is gentilman / or has any honest place Monseur, and so they
will say also fainng your honor. Now we know this word (Lord) in our country
is used otherwise / to note some great personage / either by reason of birth or
by reason of some high dignity in the common wealth / which he occupyeth: and
therefore those titles although they were somewhat excessive / yet were they
nothing so swelling and stately as ours are.

And as touching Ambrose house / albeit the word does not employ so great
gorgeousnes nor magnificence of an house as the palaces and other magnificall
buildinges of our bishops: yet the cause whereupon this rose / does more
excuse Ambrose / who being taken from great wealth and government in the common
wealth / giving over his office / did retain his house and that which he had
gotten.

But our bishops do maynteyne this pomp and excess / of the charges of the
church / with whose goods a great number of idle loytering serving men are
mayntayned / which ought to be bestowed upon the ministers / which want
necessary finding for their families / and upon the poor / and mayntenance of
the universities. As for these riotous expenses of the church goods / when
many other mynisters want / and of making great dynners and entertayning great
Lords and maiestrates / and of the answer to them that say they do help the
church by this means / I will refer the reader to that which Jerome writes
in a certain Ad nepotian^ monachum.
place where this is handled more at large. By this which I have cyted it
appears / what was one cause of this excess and stately pomp of the bishops
/ namely that certain noble and rich men / being chosen to the ministry and
living somewhat like unto the former estates wherein they were before / others
also assayed to be like unto them: as we see in that point the nature of man is
too ready to follow / if they see any example before their eyes. But there is
no reason because Ambrose and such like did so / therefore our bishops should
do it of the churches costs. Nor because Ambrose and such like did tarry in
their trim houses which they had built them selves of their own charge before
they were bishops / that therefore they should come out of their chambers or
narow houses / into courts and palaces builded of the churches costs.

An other reason of this pomp and statelynes of the bishops was / that which
almost brought in all poison and popish corruption into the church / and that
is a foolish emulation of the manners and fashions of the Idolatrous nations.
For as this was the craft of satan to draw away the Israelites from the true
service of God / by their fond desire they had to conform them selves to the
fashyons of the gentiles: so to punish unthankful receiving of the gospel /
and to fulfill the Prophesies touching the man of sin / the Lord suffered
those that professed Christ to corrupt their ways by the same sleyght of the
Devil.

Galerianus Maximinus the Emperor to the end that he might promote the Eusebius.
8. cap. 15
Idolatry and superstition whereunto he was addicted / chose of the choysest
magistrates to be priests / and that they might be in great estimation gave
each of them a train of men to follow them. And the christians and christian
Emperors / thinking that that would promote the christian relygion that
promoted superstition / and not remembering that it is often times abhomynable
before God / which is esteemed in the eyes of men / endeavored to make their
bishops encounter and match with those Idolatrous priests / and to cause that
they should not Luke. 16. 15.
be inferior to them in wealth and outward pomp. And therefore I conclude that
seeing the causes and fountaynes from whence this pomp and statelynes of
bishops have come / are so corrupt and naught / the thing it self which has
risen of such causes can not be good.

And thus will I make an end / leaving to the consideration and indifferent
waying of the indifferent reader / how true it is that I have before propounded
/ that our Archbyshops / Metropolitanes / Archdeacons / Bishops / have besides
the names almost nothing common with those which have been in elder times /
before the sun of the gospel began to be maruellously darkened / by the
stinking mistes which the devil sent forth out of the bottomless pit to blind
the eyes of men / that they should not see the shame and nakedness of that
purpled whore / which in the person of the clergy / long before she gat into
her seat prepared her self by paynting her wrythen face / with the couloures
of these gorgeous titles and with the show of magnifycall and worldly pomp.
For the devil knew well enough / that if he should have set up one only
bishop in that seat of perdition / and left all the rest in that simplicity
wherein God had appointed them / that his eldest son should neither have had
any way to get into that / and when he had gotten it / yet being as it were
an owl amongst a sort of birds / should have been quickly discovered.

But I have done / only this I admonish the reader that I do not allow of all
those things which I before alleged in the comparison between our
Archbyshoppes and the Archbyshops of old time / or our bishops and theirs.
Only my intent is to show that although there were corruptions / yet in respect
of ours they be much more tolerable: and that it might appear how small cause
there is that they should allege their examples to confirm the Archbyshops
and Bishops that now are.

Concerning the offices of commissionership and how unmeet it is that
mimisters of the word should exercise them / and how that the word of God
does not permit any such confusion of offices / there shall be by Gods grace
spoken of it afterward.

To your answer also unto the places of S. Matthew and Luke / the reply is made
before. The place of the fourth of the first to the Corinthyans / is well
alleged / for it teaches a moderate estymation of the mynisters / and a mean
between the contempt and excessive estymation / neither can there be any redyer
way to breed that disorder which was amongst the Corinthyans / as to say I
hold of such a one / and I of such a one / and I of such an other / then to
set up certain mynisters in so high Titles and great show of worldly
honor. For so comes it to pass / that the people will say / I believe my
Lord / and my Lord archbyshoppe / whatsoever our parson say / for they be
wise men and learned / as we see it came to pass amongst the Corrinthyans.
For the Apostles because they had a show and outward pomp of speech /
they carried away the people. For although Saint Paul says that some said /
I hold of 1. Cor. 4. 6.
Paul / I hold of Apollo / I of Cephas / yet as it appears in an other
place / they held one of this brave eloquent teacher / an other of that. For
he translated these speeches unto him and his fellows by a figure. All that
rule is tyrannycall / which is not lawful / and is more then it ought to be
/ and therefore the place of Saint Peter is fitly alleged / whereof also I have
spoken some thing before.

You are you say of Hemingius mind / and think that this opynion smells of
Anabaptisme / I have showed how you have depraved and corrupted Hemingius / and
desire you to show some better reason of your opynion / autos ephe, will not
suffice us. You say / that if we had once obtained equality amongst the
clergy / we would attempt it in the laity.

In what star do you see that Master Doctor? Moses says / that if a Deuteronomy.
18. 22.
man speak of a thing to come / and it come not to pass as he has spoken /
that that man is a false Prophet / if your prophecy come not to pass / you
know your judgment already out of Moses.

The Pharisees when our savior Christ inueighed against their ambytion /
accused him that he was no freende to Caesar / and went about to discredit Luke

him with the cyuill Magistrate / you shall apply it your self / you will
needs make the Archbyshoppe. etc. neighbors unto the cyuill Magistrates /
and yet they almost dwell as far a sonder as Rome and Jerusalem / and as Syon
and S. Peter's Church there / so that the house of the archbyshoppe may be
burnt stick and stone / when not so much as the smoke shall approach the house
of the cyuill magistrate.

In the. 116. page / for the authority of the archbyshoppe / is alleged the
nynthe Canon of the Council of Antioch / which I have before alleged / to
prove how far different the authority of the Metropolitan in those times
was from that which is now. For there the Council shows that every Bishop
in his Diocese / has the ordering of all matters within the circuit thereof /
and therefore the meaning of the Council to be / that if there be any affairs
that touch the whole Church many land / that the Bishops should do
nothing without making the Metropolitan privy / as also the Metropolitan
might do nothing without making the other Bishops a counsel of that which he
attempted / which master Doctor does clean leave out.

And if this authority which the council gives to the Metropolitan / being
nothing so excessive as ye authorytie of our Metropolitanes now / had not been
over much / or had been justifiable / what needed men father this Canon (which
was ordained in this council) of the Apostles / for the seeking falsely of the
name of the Apostles / to give creadite unto this Canon / does carry with it a
note of evil and of shame / which they would have covered as it were with the
garment of the Apostles authority.

And in the hundredth twenty and three page / to that which Master Bucer
says / that in the Churches there has been one which has been chief over
the rest of the mynisters / if he mean one chief in every particulare church
/ or one chief over the mynisters of diverse churches meeting at one Synod /
and chief for the time / and for such respects as I have before showed / then
I am of that mind which he is: And if he mean any other chief / or after any
other sort / I deny that any such cheefety was from the Apostles times / or
that any such cheefetie pleases the holy ghost / whereof I have before
showed the proufes.

And whereas M. Bucer seems to allow / that the name of a bishop / which the
holy ghost expressly gives to all the ministers of the word indifferently / was
appropriated to certain chief gouernoures of the church / I have before showed
by diverse reasons / how that was not done without great presumption and
manifest danger / and in the end great hurt to the church.

And if M. Doctor delyght thus to oppose men's authority to the authority of
the holy ghost / and to the reasons which are grounded out of the scripture /
M. Calvin does openly misselyke of the making of that name proper and peculiar
to certain / which the holy ghost makes common to more. And whereas of M.
Caluines words / which says that there be degrees of honor in the mynistery /
M. Doctor would gather an archbishop / if he had understood that an Apostle
is above an Evangelist / an Evangelist above a pastor / a pastor above a doctor
/ and he above an elder that rules only / he needed never to have gone to the
popish Hierarchy / to seek his dyuersities of degrees / which he might have
found in S. Paul. And whereas upon M. Caluines words / which says that
Paul was one of the chief amongst the Apostles / he would seem to conclude
an archbishop amongst the bishops / he should have remembered / that S. Paul's
cheeftie amongst the Apostles / consisted not in having any authority or
domynion over the rest / but in laboring and suffering more then the rest /
and in gifts more excellent then the rest.

Now where as he says / that we desire to pull the rule from others / that
the rule might be in our hands / and we might do what we list / and that we
seek to wythdraw our selves from controlement of Prince / and Bishop / and
all. First / he may learn if he will / that we desire no other authority
then that / which is to the edifying of the church / and which is grounded of
the word of God: which if any mynister shall abuse to his gain or ambytion /
then he ought to abide not only the controlement of the other mynisters / yea
of the brethren / but also further the punishment of the Magistrates according
to the quantity of the fault.

And seeing you charge the brethren so sore / you must be put in remembrance /
that this unreasonable authority over the rest of the mynisters and clergy /
came to the bishops and archbyshops / when as the Pope did exempt his
shauelinges from the obedience / subjection / and jurisdiction of the Princes:
now therefore that we be ready to give that subjection unto the Prince / and
offer our selves to the Princes correction in things wherein we shall do a
miss / do you think it an unreasonable thing / that we desire to be
disburdened of the bishops and archbyshops yoke / which the Pope has laid
upon our necks?

And in the. 207. page unto the midst of the 214. page / this matter is
again handled / where first M. Doctor would draw the place of Galathians the
second / to prove an archbishop / and that by a false translation / for hoi
dokountes / which is (they that seemed or appeared) he has translated (they ye
are the chief) and although the place of the Galathians may be thought of some
not so pregnant / nor so full against the archbishop / yet all must needs
confess / that it makes more against him then for him. For S. Paul's purpose
is to prove there / that he was not inferioure to any of the Apostles / and
brings one argument thereof / that he had not his gospel from them / but from
Christ immediately / and therefore if the apostles that were esteemed most of /
and supposed by the Galathians and others to be the chief / had no
superiority over S. Paul / but were equal with him / it follows that there
was none that had rule over the rest. And if there needed no one of the
Apostles to be ruler over the rest / there seems to be no need / that one
bishop should rule over the rest. But that I run not back to that I have
handled before / I will not here so much urge the place / as I will not do
also that of the Hebrews which follows / and yet the argument is stronger /
then that M. Doctor could answer. For if the writer to the Hebrews / do
prove our savior Christ's vocation to be just and lawful / because his
calling was contained in the scriptures / as appears in the 5. and 6. verse /
then it follows that the calling of the archbishop which is not comprehended
there / is neither just nor lawful. For that no man (says the apostle) takes
that honor unto him self / but he that is called of God. etc. But I say /
having before sufficiently spoken of the reasons which overthrow the
archbyshoppe / I will let pass these and other places / answearing only that
which M. Doctor brings for the establishment of them. He says therefore
afterward / that although one man be not able to be bishop over all the church
/ yet he may be bishop over a whole diocese / or of a province. Now if I would
say the one is as impossible as the other / and for proof thereof allege that
which the Philosophers say / that as there are no degrees in that which is
infinite / so that of things which are infinite / one thing can not be more
infinite then an other / so there are no degrees in impossibility / that of
things which are impossible / one thing should be more impossible then an
other: If I should thus reason / I think I should put you to some pain.
But I will not draw the reader to such thorney and subtle questyons / it is
enough for us / that the one and the other be impossible / although one should
be more impossible then the other. And that it is impossible for one man to
be bishop over a whole province / or over a whole dyocese / I leave it to
be considered of that which is before said in the description of the office
of a bishop / pastor / or minister / where I speak of the necessity of the
residence of the bishop in his church.

As a Prince may rule a whole realm / such as France / or England / so may
he rule the whole world by officers and magistrates appointed underneath him:
And there have been diverse Princes / which have had as many lands under their
power / as the Pope has had churches / and although it be somewhat
inco^uenient / yet I know not why they might not so have / coming lawfully by
them. Now I would gladly hear whether you would say the same of a bishop /
and if you dare not / then why do you bring the similitude of the government
of a Prince over a land / to prove that an archbishop may be over a whole
province. M. Doctor dare boldly say / that there may be one bishop over a whole
province / but he dare not say that there may be a bishop over the whole
Church. But what better warrant for the one / then for the other? Again / if
the whole church be in one province or in one realm / which has been / and is
not impossible to be again / if there may be now one bishop over a realm or
province / then there may be one bishop over all the church / so that in
trauayling with an archbishop / he has brought forth a Pope.

But he says that an archbishop has not the charge of government over the
whole province generally / but in cases exempted / and so may do it more
easily: But he should have remembered / that he assigned before the offices of
archbishop and bishop / to be in all those things / which other ministers are /
and that besides those offices / he gives them particulare charges. So that
where the office of the minister is but to preach / pray / and minister the
sacraments in his parish / the office of archbishop and bishop / is to do the
same / and more in the whole prounice or diocese. And so it follows that it
is easyer for a minister to discharge his duty in his parish / then for an
archbishop or bishop to discharge their duties in any one parish of their
province or diocese. For they have in every parish more to do / and greater
charge / then the mynister of the paryshe has / then much less are they able
to do their duties in all the paryshes of their provinces or dyocese.

After M. Doctor translateth out of M. Calvin / the papists reasons for the
supremacy of the Pope / and M. Caluines solutions. For what purpose he knows
/ I can not tell / unless it be to blot paper / I know not what he should mean
/ and the quarrel also which he picketh / to translate this place / is yet more
strange. For he says that the authors of the admonition / borrowed their
arguments from the papists / when the contrary is true / that they use the
reasons which they of the gospel use against the supremacy of the pope / to
overthrow the archbyshoppe. And master Doctor does use reasons to defend the
archbishop / which the papists use to maintain the Pope. For M. Doctor would
prove / that for because there is one king over a realm / therefore there may
be one bishop over a province / and the papists use the same reason to prove
the Pope to be a bishop of the whole church. Show now one reason / that the
authors of the admonition brought of the papists / to prove that there should
be no archbishop. But now I perceive his meaning / and that is / that he
thought to get some comfort for the archbishop in M. Caluins solutions made
unto the papists reasons for the supremacy: and therefore he has haled and
pulled in as it were by the shulders / this disputation between the protestants
and the papists touching the supremacy. And what is it that M. Calvin says
for the archbishop? It has been before showed / what his judgment was
touching having one mynister over all the mynisters of a province / and that he
does simply condemn it in his commentary upon the first chap. of the
Phillippians. Now let it be considered / whether in these sentences he has
said any thing against him self. The papists object that for so much as there
was one high priest in Jury over all the church / therefore there should be one
bishop over all. To whom M. Calvin answeareth / that the reason follows not:
for says he / there is no reason to extend that to all the world / which was
profitable in one nation. Hereupon M. Doctor would conclude that M. Calvin
allowath one archbishop over a whole province.

If one going about to prove that he may have as many wives as he list /
would allege Jacob for an Example which had two wives: and Master Doctor
should answer and say / that although he might have two wives / yet it
follows not that he may have as many as he list / would not Master Doctor
think that he had great iniurye / if a man should conclude of these words /
that his opynion is that a man may have two wives? I think that he would
suppose that he had great wrong / and yet thus would he conclude of Master
Caluines words in this first sentence / whereas in deed M. Calvin declares
a little after / a special reason why there was but one high priest in the
whole land of Jury / which is because he was a figure of Christ / and that
thereby should be shadowed out his sole meditation between God and his church.
And therefore shows ye for so much as there is none to represent or figure our
savior Christ / that his judgment is / that as there should be no one over
all the churches / so should there be no one over any nation. To the papists
obiecting for the supremacy / that S. Peter was the prince and chief of the
apostles / M. Calvin answers / first by denying that Peter was so / and
brings many places to prove yt he was equal to the other apostles. Afterward
he says / although it be granted / that Peter was chief / yet follows it
not because one may bear rule over twelve being but a few in number / that
therefore one may rule over an hundredth thousand / and that it follows not /
that that which is good amongst a few / is forth with good in all the world.
Now let all men judge / with what conscience and trust / M. Doct. cyteth M.
Calvin / for to prove the office of the archbishop. But I marvel that he could
not also see that / which M. Calvin writes in the next sentence almost / where
he says that Christ is only the head of the church / and that the church does
cleave one to an other under his domynion: but by what means? according (says
he) to the order and form of policy which he has prescribed / but he has
prescribed no such form of policy / that one bishop should be over all the
mynisters and churches in a whole diocese / or one archbishop over all the
ministers and churches in a whole province / therefore this form of policy
which is by archbyshops / and such bishops as we have / is not the means to
knitte us one to an other in unity under the domynion of Christ. Touching the
titles and names of honor which are given to the Ecclesiastical persons with
us / and how that princes and cyuill magistrates may and ought to have the
title / which can not be given to the mynisters / I have spoken before / and
therefore of archbyshops / archdeacons / and the lord bishops thus far.

To the next section contained in the. 77. 78. and a piece of the. 79. page.
BEfore I come to speak of prayers / I will treat of the faults that are
committed almost thrughout the whole Leyturgy / and public service of the
church of England. Whereof one is that / which is often objected by the authors
of the admonition / that the form of it / is taken from the church of
Antichrist / as the reading of the Epistles and Gospels so cut and mangled /
as the most of the prayers / the manner of mynistring the Sacraments / of
Marriage / of Burial / Confirmation / translated as it were word for word /
saving that the gross erroures and manifest impieties be taken away. For
although the forms and ceremonies which they used / were not unlawful / and
that they contained nothing which is not agreeable to the word of God (which I
would they did not) yet notwithstanding / neither the word of God / nor reason
/ nor the examples of the eldest churches both Iewishe and christian / do
permit us to use the same forms and ceremonies / being neither commanded of
God / neither such / as there may not as good as they / and rather better be
established.

For the word of God I have showed before / both by the example of the apostles
conforming the Gentiles unto the Jews in their ceremonies / and not
contrariwise the Jews to the Gentiles / and by that the wisdom of God has
thought Act. 15. 20.
it a good way to keep his people from the infection of idolatry and
superstition / to severe them from idolaters by outward ceremonies / and
therefore has forbidden them to do things which are in them selves very
lawful to be done. Leuit. 19. 27. Deu. 22. 11. 12 Leuit. 11. Deuteronomy. 14. 2
Exhes. 2. 14.


Now I will add this further / that when as the Lord was careful to severe
them by ceremonies from other nations / yet was he not so careful to severe
them from any / as from the * Egiptia^s amongst whom they lived / and from
those nations which were next neighbors unto them / because from them was the
greatest fear of infection. Therefore by this constant and perpetual wisdom
which God uses to keep his people from idolatry / it follows / ye the
religion of God / Leuit. 18. 3. Deuteronomy. 17. 16.
should not only in matter and substance / but also (as far as may be) inform
and fashion differ from ye of the idolaters / and especially the papists which
are round about us / and amongst us. For in deed it were more safe for us to
conform our indifferent ceremonies to the Turks which are far of / then to
the papists which are so near.

Common reason also does teach / that contraries are cured by their contraryes:
now Christianity and Antichristianitie / the gospel and popery / be
contraries / therefore antichristianitie must be cured not by it self / but by
that which is (as much as may be) contrary unto it: So that a meddled and
mingled estate of the order of the gospel / and the ceremonies of popery / is
not the best way to banish popery. And therefore as to abolishe ye infection of
false doctrine of the papists / it is necessary to establish a diverse doctrine
/ and to abolish the tira^ny of ye popish government / necessary to plant the
discipline of Christ: so to heal y^ infection y^ has crept into men's minds
by reason of the popish order of service / it is meet that the other order
were put in the place thereof. Philosophy which is nothing else but reason /
teaches / that if a man will draw one from vice which is an extreme unto
virtue / which is the mean / that it is the best way to bring him as far from
that vice as may be / and that it is safer and less harm for him to be led
somewhat too far / then he should be suffered to remain within the borders
and contines of that vice wherewith he is infected. As if a man would bring a
droncken man to sobriety / the best and nearest way is to carry him as far
from his excess in druicke as may be / and if a man could not keep a mean /
it were better to fault in prescribing less then he should drink / then to
fault in giving him more then he ought. As we see to bring a stick which is
crooked / to be straight / we do not only bow it so far until it come to be
straight / but we bend it so far / until we make it so crooked of the other
side / as it was before of the first side / to this end / that at the last it
may stand straight / and as it were in the mid way between both the crookes /
which I do not therefore speak / as though we ought to abolishe one evil and
hurtful ceremony for an other / but that I would show / how it is more
dangerous for us that have been plunged in the mire of Popery / to use the
Ceremonies of it / then of any other idolatrous and superstitious service of
God. This wisdom of not conforming it self unto the ceremonies of the
Idolaters in things indifferent / has the church followed in times passed.

Tertullian says / O says he / better is the relygion of the heathen / for
they Libro de Idolatria.
use no solemnity of the Christians / neither the Lords day / neither the
Pentecoste / and if they knew them / they would have nothing to do with them
/ for they would be afraid / least they should seem Christians / but we are
not afraid to be called heathen.

Constantine the Emperor speaking of the keeping of the feast of Easter /
Euse.li. 3. c. 17.
says that it is an unworthy thing to have any thing common with that most
spiteful company of the Jews. And a little after he says / that it is most
absurd and against reason / that the Jews should vaunt and glory / that the
Christians Socr. 1. li. ca. 9.
could not keep those things without their doctrine. And in an other place it
is said after this sort: It is convenient so to order the matter / that we have
nothing common with that nation.

The Councelles although they did not observe them selves always in making of
decrees this rule / yet have kept this consideration continually in making
their laws / that they would have the christians differ from others in their
ceremonies.

* The council of Laodicia / which was afterward confirmed by the sixthe Tom.
1. conc. Laod. cano. 38.
general council decreed / that the Christians should not take unleavened
bread of the Jews / or communicate with their impiety.

* Also it was decreed in an other council / that they should not deck their
2. Tom. Braccar canon. 73.
houses with baye leaves and green bows / because the Paganes did use so /
and that they should not rest from their labors those days that the paganes
did / that they should not keep the first day of every month as they did.

* An other council decreed / that the christians should not celebrate feasts
Africa. council. c. 27.
on the birth days of the Martyrs / because it was the manner of the heathen:
whereby it appears / that both of singular men and of councels / in making
or abolishing of Ceremonies / heed has been taken / that the Christians
should not be like unto the Idolaters / no not in those things which of them
selves are most indifferent to be used / or not used. It were not hard to
show the same considerations in the several things which are mentioned of in
this admonition / as for example in the ceremonies of prayer / which is here
to be handled / we read that Tertullian would not have the Christians sit
after they had prayed / Lib. de anima.
because the idolaters did so / but having showed this in general to be the
policy of God first / and of his people afterward / to put as much
difference as can be commodiously between the people of God and others which
are not / I shall not need to show the same in the particulares.

Furthermore / as the wisdom of God has thought it the best way / to keep
his people from infection of idolatry / to make them most unlike the idolaters:
so has the same wisdom of God thought good / that to keep his people in the
unity of the truth / there is no better way / then that they should be most
like one to an other / and that as much as possibly may be / they should have
all the same ceremonies. And therefore S. Paul to establishe this order in the
church of Corinth / 1. Cor. 16. 1.
that they should make their gatherings for the pore upon the first day of
the Saboth (which is our sunday) alleges this for a reason / that he had so
ordained in other churches / so that as children of one father / and servants
of one family / he will have all the churches / not only have one diet / in
that they have one word / but also wear / as it were one livery / in using the
same ceremonies.

This rule did the great council of Nice follow / when it ordained / y^ where
Council. Nice. canon. 20.
certain at the feast of Pentecost / did pray kneeling / that they should pray
standing / the reason whereof is added / which is / that one custom ought to
be kept throughout all the churches. It is true / that the diversity of
ceremonies ought not to cause the churches to dissent one with an other / but
yet it makes much to the avoiding of dissension / that there be amongst them
an unity / not only in doctrine / but also in Ceremonies. Now we see plainly
/ that as the form of our service and Leyturgie comes to near that of the
papists / so it is far different from that of other churches reformed / and
therefore in both these respects to be amended.

An other fault there is in the whole service or Lyturgie of England / for
that it maintains an unpreaching ministry / and so consequently an unlawful
ministry. I say it maintains / not so much in that it appoynteth a number
of psalms and other prayers and chapters to be red / which may occupye the
time which is to be spent in preaching / wherein notwythstanding it ought to
have been more wary / considering that the devil under this color of long
prayer / did thus in the kingdom of antichriste banish preaching / I say not
so much in that point / as for that it requires necessarily nothing to be done
by the minister / which a child of ten year old can not do / as well and as
lawfully / as that man wherewyth the book contenteth it self. Neither can it
be shifted / in saying this is done for want of able men to be ministers / for
it may be easily answered / that first the want of sufficient ministers ought
to be no cause for men to break the unchangeable laws of God / which be /
that none may be made minister of the church / which can not teach / that
none minister the sacraments which do not preach. For although it might be
granted / (which thing I would not deny / no not when there are enough
sufficient ministers /) that they may appoint some godly grave man which can do
nothing else but read to be a reader in the church / yet that may not be
granted / that they may make of one that can do nothing but read / a
minister of the gospel / or one which may have power to minister the
sacraments.

Besides that / how can they say that it is for want of sufficient ministers /
when as there be put out of the ministerye men that be able to serve God in
that calling / and those put in their roumes / which are not able / when there
are numbers also which are fit to serve and never sought for / nor once
required to take any ministry upon them? If therefore it were lawful to plead
want of able ministers / for this dumb ministry which is altogether unlawful
/ yet would this plea never be good / until such time as both those were
restored which are put out / and all other sought forth and called upon which
are fit for that purpose.

Again / it can not be said justly / that they have taken these reading
ministers / until such time as better may be gotten / for if the church could
procure able ministers / and should desire that they might be ordained over
them / they can not obtain that / considering that these reading ministers
have a free hold / and an estate for term of their lives in those churches /
of the which they are such ministers: so that by this means / the sheep are
not only committed to an idol shepherd / I might say a wolf / and speak no
otherwise then Aug. speaks / in that a not preaching minister has entrance
into the church / but the door also is shut upon him / and sparred against
any able minister / that might happily be found out.

There is a third fault / which likewise appears almost in the whole body of
this service and Liturgy of England / and that is that the profit which might
have come by it unto the people / is not reaped. Whereof the cause is / for
that he which reads / is not in some places heard / and in the most places
not understood of the people / through the distance of place between the
people and the minister / so that a great part of the people can not of
knowledge tell / whether he has curssed them or blessed them / whether he
has red in Latin or in English / all the which rises upon the words of the
book of service / which are that the minister should stand in the accustomed
place. For thereupon the minister in saying morning and evening prayer /
sits in the chauncell / with his back to the people / as though he had
some secreate talk with God / which the people might not hear. And hereupon
it is likewise / that after morning prayer for saying a another number of
prayers / he climeth up to the further end of the chauncel / and runs as
far from the people / as the wall will let him / as though there were some
variance between the people and the minister / or as though he were afraid of
some infection of plage. And in deed it renueth the memory of the Leuitical
priesthode / which did withdraw himself from the people into the place called
the holiest place / where he talked with God / and offered for the sins of
the people.

Likewise for Marriage he comes back again into the body of the church / and
for baptism unto the church door / what comelines / what decency / what
edifying is this? Decency (I say) in running and trudging from place to place
/ edifying: in standing in that place / and after that sort / where he can
worst be hard and understood. S. Luke shows / that in the primitive church
both the prayers Acts. 1. 15.
and preachings / and the whole exercise of religion was done otherwise. For he
shows how S. Peter sitting amongste the rest / to the end he might be the
better heard / rose / and not that only / but that he stood in the midst of the
people / that his voice might as much as might be / come indifferently to all
their ears / and so standing / both prayed and preached. Now if it be said for
the chapters and Letany / there is commandment given / that they should be red
in the body of the church / in deed it is true / and thereof is easily
perceived this disorder which is in saying the rest of the prayers / partly in
the hither end / and partly in the further end of the chauncell. For seeing
that those are red in the body of the church / that the people may both hear
and understand what is red / what should be the cause why the rest should be red
farther of / unless it be / that either those things are not to be heard of them
/ or at the least not so necessary for them to be heard as the other which are
recited in the body or midst of the church. And if it be further said / that
the book leaves that to the discretion of the ordinarye / and that he may
reform it if there be any thing amiss / then it is easily answered again / that
besides that it is against reason / that the commoditye and edifying of the
church should depend upon the pleasure of one man / so that upon his either
good or evil advise and discretion / it should be well or evil with the
church: Besides this (I say) we see by experience of the disorders which are in
many churches and dioceses in this behalf / how that if it were lawful to
commit such authority unto one man / yet that it is not safe so to do /
considering that they have so evil quitten them selves in their charges / and
that in a matter / the inconvenience whereof being so easily seen / and so
easily reformed / there is notwythstanding so great and so general an abuse.
And the end of the order in the book is to be observed / which is to keep the
prayers in the accustomed place of the church / chapel / or chauncell / which
how makes it to edification? And thus for the general faults committed
either in the whole Liturgy / or in the most part of it / both that I may have
no need to repete the same in the particulares / and that I be not compelled
always to enter a new disputation / so often as M. Doctor says very
unskillfully / and unlike a divine / whence so ever this or that come / so it be
not evil / it may be well established in the church of Christ.

Now I come to the form of prayer which is prescribed / wherein the authors of
the admonition declare / that their meaning is not to disalow of prescript
service of prayer / but of this form that we have. For they expound themselves
in the additions unto the first part of the admonition. It is not to any
purpose / yt M. Doctor sets himself to prove / that there may be a
prescript order of prayer by Iustine Martyrs testimony / which notwithstanding
has not one word of prescript form of prayers / only he says there were
prayers. He says in deed the ancient fathers say that there has been
always such kind of prayers in the churches / and although they do say so /
yet all men may understand easily / that M. doctor speaks this rather by
conjecture / or that he has heard other me^ say so: for so much as that Doctor
which he has chosen out to speak for all the rest / has no such thing / as
he fathereth on him. He says that after they have baptized / they pray for
them selves / and for him that is baptized / and for all men that they may be
mete to learn the truth / and to expres it in their honest conversation / and
that they be found to keep the commandments / that they may attain to
eternal life / but is this to say ye there was a prescript form of prayer /
when he shows nothing else but the chief points upon ye which they conceived
their prayers? If you had alleged this to prove what were the matters or
principal points that the primitive church used to pray for / you had
alleged this to purpose / but to allege it for a proof of a prescript form
of prayer / when there is not there mentioned so much as the essential form
of prayer (which is the asking of our petitions in the name / and through the
intercession of our savior Christ) without the which there is not / nor cannot
be any prayer / argues that either you little know what the form of prayer is
/ or that you thought (as you charge the authors of the admonition so often)
that this gear of yours should never have come to the examination. But for as
much as we agree of a prescript form of prayer to be used in the church let
that go: this that I have said / is to show that when M. Doctor happens of a
good cause / which is very seldom in this book / yet then he marreth it in the
handling. After he affirms / that there can be nothing showed in the whole
book / which is not agreeable unto the word of God.

I am very loathe to enter into this field / albeit M. Doctor does thus provoke
me / both because the Papists will lightly take occasion of evil speaking /
when they understand that we do not agree amongst our selves in every point /
as for that some few professors of the gospel being private men / boldened
upon such treatises / take such ways sometimes / and break forth into such
speeches / as are not meet nor convenient.

Notwythstanding my duty of defending the truth / and love which I have
first toward God / and then toward my country / constrains me being thus
provoked / to speak a few words more particularly of the form of prayer /
that when the blemishes thereof do appear / it may please the Queens
majesty / and her honorable Council / with those of the Parliamente / whom
the Lord has used as singular instruments to deliver this realm from the
hot furnaice and iron yoke of the popish Egipte / to procure also / that the
corruptions which we have brought from them (as those wysh which we being so
deeply did and stained / have not so easily shaken of) may be removed from
amongst us / to the end that we being nearelyer both joined unto the sincerity
of the gospel / and the policy of other reformed churches / may thereby be
joined nearer with the Lord / and may be set so far from Rome / that both we
may comfort our selves in the hope / that we shall never return thither again
/ and our adversaries which desire it / and by this too much agreement with
them / and too little with the reformed churches / hope for it / may not only
be deceived of their expectation / but also being out of all hope of that which
they desire / may the sooner yield themselves unto the truth / whereunto they
are now disobedient.

And as for the papists triumph in this case / I shall not greatly need to
fear it / considering that their discords and contentions are greater / and
that our strife is / because we would be farther from them. For the other that
profes the gospel / I will desire in the name of God / that they abuse not my
labor to other end / then I bestow it / and that they keep them selves in
their callings / commit the matter by prayer unto the Lord / leaving to the
ministers of the word of god / and to the magistrates that / which appertains
unto them.

To come therefore to touch this matter / I answer that there is fault in the
The collect of Trinitye sunday.
matter / and fault in the form. In the matter / for that there are things
there / that ought not to be / and things there are wanting in the order that
should be. Of the first sort is / that we may evermore be defended from all
adversity.

Now / for as much as there is no promise in the scripture / that we should be
free from all adversity / and that evermore / it seems that this prayer might
have been better conceived / being no prayer of faith / or of the which we can
assure our selves that we shall obtain it. For if it be said that by the word
(adversity) is meant all evil / we know that it has no such signification /
neither in this tongue of ours / neither in other tongues which use the same
word in common with us / but that it signifies trouble / vexation / and
calamitye / from all the which we may not desire always to be delivered. And
whatsoever can be alleged for the defense of it / yet every one that is not
contentious / may see that it needs some caution or exception.

In the collect upon the twelfth sunday after Trinity sunday / and likewise in
one of those which are to be said after the Offertorie (as it is termed) is
done / request is made / that God would give those things which we for our
unworthiness dare not ask / which carries with it still the note of the popish
servile fear / and sauoureth not of that confidence and reverent familiarity
/ that the children of God have thorough Christ / with their heavenly father.
For as we dare not without our savior Christ ask so much as a crumme of
bread / so there is nothing which in his name we dare not ask / being
needful for us / and if it be not needful / why should we ask it? And if
all the prayers were gathered together / and referred to these two heads of
Gods glory / and of the things which pertain to this present life / I can make
no Geometrical and exact measure / but verily I believe / there shall be found
more then a third part of the prayers which are not psalms and texts of
scriptures / spent in praying for / and praying against the commodities / and
incommodities of this life / which is contrary to all the arguments or contents
of the prayers of the church / which are set down in the scripture / and
especially of our savior Christ's prayer / by the which ours ought to be
directed / which of.vij. petitions / bestows one only that ways. And this /
these foresaid prayers do / not only in general words / but by deducting the
commodities and incommodities of this life into their particulare kinds / and
we pray for the avoiding of those dangers which are nothing near us / as from
lightning and thundering in the midst of winter / from storm and tempest /
when the weather is most fair / and the seas most calm. etc. It is true /
that upon some urgent calamity / a prayer may and ought to be framed / which
may beg either the commodity for want whereof the Church is in distres / or the
turning away of that mischief which either approaches / or which is already
upon it: but to make those prayers which are for the present time and danger
/ ordinarye and dailye prayers / I can not hitherto see any / either scripture
or example of the primitive church. And here for the simples sake I will set
down after what sort this abuse crept into the church.

There was one Mamercus bishop of Vienna / which in the time of great Platina
cap. Leo.
earthquakes which were in France / instituted certain supplications / which
the Grecians / and we of them call the Letany / which concerned that matter:
there is no doubt but as other discommodities rose in other countries / they
likewise had prayers accordingly. Now Pope Gregory either made himself / or
gathered the supplications that were made against the calamities of every
country / and made of them a great Letany or supplication / as Platina calls
it / and gave it to be used in all churches: which thing albeit all churches
might do for the time in respect of the case of the casamity which the churches
suffered / yet there is no cause why it should be perpetual / that was
ordained but for a time / and why all lands should pray to be delivered from
the incommodities / that some land has been troubled with.

The like may be said of the gloria patri, and the Athanasius Creed: it was
first brought into the church / to the end that: nen thereby should make an
open profession in the church of the divinity of the son of God / against
the detestable opinion of Arius and his disciples / wherewith at that time
maruellously swarmed almost the whole christendom / now that it has pleased
the Lord to quench that fire / there is no such cause why these things should
be in the church / at the least why that gloria patri, should be so often
repeated.

Moreover / to make Benedictus, Magnificat, and Nunc dimittis, ordinarye and
daily prayers / seems to be a thing not so convenient / considering that they
do no more concern us / the^ all other scriptures do / and then does the Aue
Maria, as they called it. For although they were prayers of thanks giving in
Simeon / acharie / and the blessed virgin Mary / yet can they not be so in us /
which have not received like benefits / they may be added to the number of
Psalms / and so song as they be / but to make daily and ordinary prayers of
them / is not without some inconvenience and disorder.

And so have I answered unto those things which are contained in the 202. 203.
pages / saving that I must admonish the reader / that whereas you will prove
that we ought to have an ordinarye prayer to be delivered from danger of
thunder / lightnings. etc. because there are examples of certain that have been
killed thereby / you might as well bring in a prayer / that men may not have
falls from their horses / may not fall into the hands of robbers / may not fall
into waters / and a number such more sudden deaths / wherewith a greater
number are taken away / then by thundrings or lightnings / and such like / and
so there should be never any end of begging these earthly co^modityes / which
is contrary to the form of prayer / appointed by our savior Christ.

And whereas you allege the petition of the Lords prayer (deliver us from
evil) to prove this prayer against Thunder. etc. besides that all the
commodities and discommodities of this life are prayed for / and prayed against
in that petition / whereby we desire our daily bread: it is very strange to
apply that to the thunder / that is understood of the devil / as the article
apo tou ponerou does declare. And that it is a marvelous conclusion / that
for so much as we ought daily and ordinarily / and publicly desire to be
delivered from the Devil / Ergo, we ought daily and ordinarily / and
publicly / desire to be delivered from thunder. It is one thing to correct
Magnificat, and an other thing to show the abuse of it: And therefore I see no
cause why you should use this allusion between Magnificat and significat, unless
it be for yt you purposing to set out all your learning in this book / would not
so much as forget an old rotten proverb / which trotted amongst the monks in
their cloisters / of whom I may justly say / which Tullie said in a another
thing. Nec quicquam ingenium potest monasterium: that is / the cloister could
never bring forth any witty thing / for here although there be Rythmus, yet
it is sine ratione. Rhyme without reason.


As these are diverse things more then ought to be conveniently / so want there
some things in the prayers. There are prayers set forth to be said in the
common calamities / and universal scourges of the realm / as plague / famine.
etc. and in deed so it ought to be by the word of God joined with a public
fast commanded / not only when we are in any calamity / but also when any the
churches round about us / or in any country receive any general plague or
grievous chastisement at the Lords hand. But as such prayers are needful /
whereby we beg release from our distresses / so there ought to be as necessary
prayers of thanks giving / when we have received those things at the Lords hand
/ which we asked in our prayers. And thus much touching the matter of the
prayers / either not altogether sound / or else too much or too little.

Concerning the form / there is also to be misliked: A great cause whereof is
the following of the form used in Popery / against which I have before spoken.
For whilst that service was set in many points as a pattern of this / it
comes to pas / that in stead of such prayers as the primitive churches have
used / and those that be reformed / now use / we have diverse short cuts and
shreddings / which may be better called wishes then prayers. And that no man
think that this is some idle fancy / and that it is no matter of weight /
what form of prayer we use / so that the prayers be good / it must be
understood / that as it is not sufficient to preach the same doctrine which
our savior Christ and his apostles have preached / unless the same form of
doctrine / and of teaching be likewise kept: so is it not enough that the
matter of our prayer be such as is in the word of God / unless that the form
also be agreeable unto the forms of prayers in the scripture. Now we have no
such forms in the scripture / as that we should pray in.ij. or.iij. lines / and
the^ after having red a while some other thing / come and pray as much more /
and so to the.xx. and.xxx. time / with pauses between.

If a man should come to a Prince / and keep such order in making his
petitions unto him / that having very many things to demand / after he had
demanded one thing / he would stay a long time / and then demand an other /
and so the third / the prince might well think / that either he came to ask
before he knew what he had need of / or that he had forgotten some piece of his
suit / or that he were distracted in his understanding / or some other such
like cause of the disorder of his supplication. And therefore how much more
convenient were it / that according to the manner of the reformed churches:
first the minister with an humble and general confession of faults / should
desire the assistance of the Lord / for the fruitful handling and receiving of
the word of God / and then after that we have heard the Lord speak unto us in
his word by his minister / the church should likewise speak unto the Lord /
and present all those petitions and suits at once / both for the whole church
and for the Prince and all other estates which shall be thought needful.

And if any will say that there are short prayers found in the Acts / it may
be answered / that S. Luke does not expres the whole prayers at large / but
only set down the sums of them / and their chief points. And further it
may be answered / that always those prayers were continued together / and not
cut off / and shred into diverse small pieces.

An other fault is / that all the people are appointed in diverse places to say
after the minister / whereby not only the time is unprofitably wasted / and a
confused voice of the people one speaking after an other caused / but an
opinion bredde in their heads / that those only be their prayers which they say
and pronounce with their own mouths / which causes them to give the les
heed to the rest of the prayers which they rehearse not after the minister /
which notwithstanding are as well their prayers / as those which they pronounce
after the minister / otherwise then the order which is left unto the church of
God does bear. For God has ordained the minister to this end / that as in
public meetings / he only is the mouth of the Lord from him to the people /
even so he ought to be only the mouth of the people from them unto the Lord /
and that all the people should attend to that which is said by the minister
/ and in the end both declare their consent to that which is said / and
there hope that it shall so be and come to pas which is prayed / by the word
(Amen) as S. Paul declares in the Epistle to 1. Cor. 14. 16. 2. apoll. pro
christianis.
the Corinthians. And Iustine Martyr shows to have been the custom of the
churches in his time.

Although these blots in the Common prayer / be such as may easily enough
appear unto any which is not wedded to a preiudicate opinion / and that there
is no great difficultye in this matter / yet I know that this treatise of
prayer will be subject to many reprehensions / and that there will not be
wanting some probable colors also / whereby these things may be defended / if
men will set them selves to strive and to contend: yet (for the desire that I
have that these things should be amended / and for the instruction of the
simpler which are studious of the truth) I have been bold to utter that which
I think / not doubting also but that the light of the truth shall be able to
scatter all those mistes of reasons / which shall go about to darken the
clearnes thereof.

To the next section beginning at the. 79. page / and holding on until the.
82. page.
Master D. requires that it should be proved unto him / that by private
baptism is meant baptism by women. First it is meant / that it should be done by
some other then the minister / for that the minister is bid to give them
warning / that they should not baptize the child at home in their house without
great cause and necessity. Secondarily / I would gladly ask him who they be
that are present / when ye child is so shortly after it is borne in great
danger of death. And last of all M. Doctor does not see / how he accuses all
the magistrates of this realm of the neglect of their duty / in that they
allow of the daily practicing by women in baptising children / if so be that
the book did not so appoint it or permit it. If he meant plainly herein / there
needed not so much ado.

The place of S. Matthew is as strong against women's baptising / as it is Chap.
28. 19.
against their preaching. For the ministry of the word and sacraments can not
be pulled in sonder / which the Lord has joined together from time to time.
For Noah which was a preacher unto the old world of the will of God / was
ordained also of God to make the Arc / which was a Sacrament and seal of his
2. Peter. 2. 5. Genes. 6. 14. Genes. 18. 19. Genes. 17. 23.
preaching touching the destruction of the world. And Abraham whom the Lord
would have to be the Doctor of his church / which was then in his family / was
also commanded to minister the Sacrament of circumcision unto his familye. The
priests and Levites which were appointed to teach the people / were also
appointed to sacrifice / and to minister other sacraments in the church.
Likewise the same Prophets which God stirred up to preach / he also ordained
to confirm the same by signs and sacraments. The same may be also brawne
through out the new Testament / as unto every of the twelve / and afterward to
the. 70. power was given / both to preach the gospel / and also to confirm
with signs Luke. 9. 1. Luke 10. 1. 17.
and miracles which were seals of their doctrine. And S. Paul by the
commandment that our savior Christ gave him to Acts. 22. 15. 1. Cor. 1.
17.
preach / undertook also to baptize / although there were no expres words
that licensed him thereunto: for he knew right well that it was the perpetual
ordinance of God / that the same should be the ministers of the word and
sacraments. Whereupon it follows / that for as much as women may not preach
the gospel / no not by the laws of the realm / that they ought not to
minister baptism. But M. Doctor rises up and says / that a woman in the
time of necessitye / and when there is none other that either can or will
preach / may preach the gospel in the church.

This is strange doctrine / and such as strengthens the Anabaptists hands
/ and sauoureth stronger that ways / then any one thing in all the admonition
/ which is so often condemned of Anabaptisme. His first reason to prove it / is
yt there are examples thereof. When we allege the examples of all the churches
of the apostles times / to prove the election of the minister by the church /
and in other cases which are general examples approved and executed by the
apostles / contrary to no commandment nor institution of God / yea / and as
has been proved according to the commandment of God / M. Doctor gives us
our answer in a word / that examples prove not: now that the question is to
make good women's preaching in the church / examples I will not say of all
churches / but of no one church / only of a few singular persons / not
according to the commandment of the word of God / but clean contrary to the
prescripte 1. Cor. 14. 34. 1. Tim. 2. 12.
word of God / I say / now examples / and such singular examples are good
proufes and strong arguments.

Now / if the speech be a true messenger of the heart / I perceive M. doctor
is of this mind / that he would have women preach in the church of England at
this time: for he can not deny (and he also confesses it sometimes) that this
is the time of necessity / and in deed it must be needs an extreme necessity /
that drives to make one man pastor of two churches / especially so far distant
/ that drives to make men which are not able to teach / ministers / and diverse
more things which are contrary to the word of God. Therefore this being a time
of necessity / by M. Doctors judgment we ought to have women to preach.
Besides this he says / if neither none other can or will preach / that then
women may preach / but in the most churches of this realm / there is none that
either can or will preach / therefore there / and in those churches women (at
the least if they be able) may preach the gospel / and consequently minister
the sacraments.

In the. 187. page / he cites M. Calvin in the. 13. chap. section. 32. to
prove that women may teach: wherein I marvel what he means so to allege M.
Calvin continually / he alleges the. 13. chapter and no book / as though he
had written but one book / and in deed there is no such thing in no such
chapter of any book of his institutions / or in any other place throughout his
whole works / as I am persuaded. If this fault had been but twice or thrice /
I would have thought it had been the printers / but now that it is continual
and so oftentimes / surely he gives great suspicion / that either some body
has mocked him with these places / or else he would abuse others / and
especially him that should answer his book / setting him to seek that he
should never find.

As for M. Caluins judgment / what it is of women's preaching / it may 4. lib.
Instit. cap. 15. sect. 20
appear by that he will not by any means / no not in the time of necessitye
(as they term it) suffer either woman or any lay man to baptize or minister
any sacrament / and therefore not to preach. And as for the examples of Mary
the sister of Moses / of Olda / of Anna / and the daughters of Philip the
evangelist / which are all called prophetisses (for I think M. doctor means
these examples) as for them I say / it will be hard for to show that they ever
prophesied / or taught openly in any public meeting or congregation. But the
surer answer is / that although the Lord do sometimes not being under any law
change the order which he has set / in raising up certain women / partly to
the shame of men / and to humble them / partly to let them understand that he
can / if he would / want their ministry: yet it is not lawful for us to draw
that into example / and to follow it: or that for as much as he breaks the
law which is not subject unto it / and which he made not for him self / that
therefore we may break the law whereunto we be subject / and to whom it is
given. But we must go in the broad high way of the commandment / and of the
ordinary usage of God in governing his church / and not in the biepath of
certain singular examples which have been in diverse ages. And as often as
God has used this extraordinary means of the ministry of women / so often
also has he confirmed their calling either by miracle or some wonderful issue
/ or with some other singular note and mark / whereby he has made their
calling otherwise strange and monstrous / most certain and undoubted to all
men.

There is greater difficulty then M. Doctor mentions / in the words of 1.
Cor. 11. 5.
S. Paul / where he says a woman praying or Prophesying ought to be veiled /
and have her head covered / in which words it seems that the Apostle
lycenceth a woman to prophecy / so that she do it with her head covered. But
to him that shall diligently consider the place / it shall appear / that the
women of Corinth / did pass the bounds of modesty and of shamefastness / two
ways / whereof one was / that they came into the congregation contrary to the
custom of those countries / with their heads and faces uncovered: an other
was / that they also took upon them to speak in the congregation / both which
faults S. Paul condemned / but in their several and proper places. Although
therefore speaking against the abuse of uncovering their head / he does not
condemn their boldness in teaching / yet he did not therefore approve it /
the confutation whereof he reserved to a more commodious place. But says he
/ if women do baptize / it is in private houses.

I have showed before that they may not baptize at all / therefore not in
private houses: besides that that I have in the Reply unto the section in the
one and twenty page showed / how it is not lawful neither to preach the word /
nor to minister the Sacraments in private corners / for the which matter of
not ministering the Sacraments in private houses / to the authors of the
Admonition / citing the eleventh Chapter of the first Epistle unto the
Corrinthians / M. Doctor answeareth that he reproves the profanation of the
supper by banketting and contempt of their brethren / and exhorts to tarry one
for an other.

But what is this to the purpose? we ask not M. Doctor the interpretation of
this place / as we do not of all the rest which he interpreateth / where there
is no occasyon in the world to interpreate them / being of them selves very
clear / and the interpretation which is brought never almost making * any
thing for the solution of that which is objected / which I desire the Reader to
mark throughout his whole book. For what if S. Paul reprove the profanation
of the supper of the Lord / does it follow therefore that he does not give to
understand / that the Sacrament should be administered in a common assembly?
What if he exhort to tarry one for an other / therefore does he not dehorte
from celebrating of the sacrament in a private house?

And surely me think / you can not be so ignorant as you make your self /
that you should not understand their argument / and therefore I think you do
rather dissemble it / as you do in diverse other places. For all men may easily
perceive / that as S. Paul opposes the supper of the Lord / to the common
supper: his banquet / to the common banquet: so he opposes there manifestly the
church 1. Cor. 11. 20. 21. 22.
and congregation / unto the pryuate house: and declares that as the common
supper or banquet / ought to be kept at their houses / so the Lords supper and
his banquet / ought to be celebrated in the congregation.

To the Admonition obiecting in the ninety and two page that John baptized
Marc. 1. 5.
openly amongst the congregation / he answeareth and says / that it may be as
well concluded that we should baptize only in the river of Iordane / and none
but those that be of age. By which saying he gives to understand / that to
baptize in the church / has no greater necessity the^ ye baptising in Iordane
/ nor it skilleth no more whether baptism be mynistred in the public assembly
/ the^ it is necessary or skilleth / whether we be baptized in the river of
Iordane / and that the baptism of young infantes / has no better grounds then
private baptism has. The later whereof (both being absurd) is too too
injurious unto the baptism of young infantes. For as of our savior Christ's
preachinges in publyke places / and refusing pryuate places / we do gather
that the preaching of the word ought to be public: even so of S. John's
preaching and baptising in open meetings / we conclude that both preaching
and baptysing / ought to be in public assemblies.

And although to some one action there concur diverse things / which partly
are not to be followed at all / partly are indifferent to be followed or not
followed: yet neither the unlawfulness of the one to be followed / nor the
indifferency of the other / can hinder / but there are other some things in the
same action necessary to be followed. Which may be considered both of the
place of the Acts / Act. 1.
touching the election / where I have proved some things there mentioned to be
necessary to be done in elections / although other some be not convenient nor
fit for us to follow. And I have showed it also by M. Calvin / which Master
Doctor alleges for him self / and by Cyprian / whose authority he would be
loath to reject I am sure / least he should lose the opynion of his
studiousnesse of the old writers / which he hunteth so dyligently after in
this book / and whereof he makes the authors of the Admonition so great
contemners. And it is not hard to show the same in.xx. places more / as in S.
Matthew and S. Luke / Math. 10. Luke 9. Luke 10.
where / as there are diverse things not to be followed of the mynisters now /
other things indifferent to be followed / so are there also other things that
be as well commanded to all the mynisters that now are / as they were then
either to the 12. or. 70. disciples. And other reason he adds there / that S.
Peter baptized in Cornelius house. But M. Doctor makes not the best choice of
his arguments / for S. Paul's baptysing in the house of the gayler / had been
more fit 16. Act. 33.
for him. For unto his place it may be easily answered / that Cornelyus having
so great a family as it is like he had / and besides that diverse soldiers
underneath him / and further his friends and his acquaintance which he had
called / had a competent number / and as many as would make a congregation /
and as could commodiously be preached unto in one place. But the answer to
both these examples and other such like / as that S. Paul baptized the house
of 1. Cor. 1. 16.
Stephana is easy. For there being persecutions at that time / so that it was
not safe neither for the mynister / nor for the people to be seen / it was
meet that they should do it in houses / which otherwise they would have
done in open places. And then / those houses which received the congregation /
were not as I have showed for the time to be counted private houses. And
further in places where the gospel has not been received / nor no church
gathered / but one only household embracing the gospel / I say in such a case
/ and especially in the time of persecution / where should the mynisters preach
or mynister the sacraments more conveniently / then in that house where those
professors of the gospel be? Now to draw this into our churches / which may
safely come into open places / and where the church and congregation stands
of diverse housholdes / is a token of great want of judgment / in shuffelyng
those things together / which for the great diversity of their natures will
not be mingled.

And in the page. 152. he brings other reasons to prove that the sacraments
may be mynistred in a private house / whereof the first is / that our savior
Christ celebrated his supper in a private house / and in an inner parlour / the
reason whereof is easily to be known / for the law of God ordained that every
householder in his house should eat the passover with his own family / if it
were so great / as that they might well eat up a whole Lamb.

Our savior Christ therefore with his household / observes this law / and for
because he would declare that the passover had his end / and that his holy
sacrament of the supper should come in place thereof / he does forthwith
celebrate it in ye same place. Which if he had not done / neither could he have
done it at al (the hour of his apprehension then approaching) neither should it
so lively have appeared / that either the passover was abolyshed / or that the
supper came in place of it / being celebrated both at an other time / and in an
other place. For the celebrating of the supper in houses in the Apostles times
/ and in Iustins and Tertullians times / which were times of persecution / I
have spoken before / where also I declared that such houses for the time are
not private but public.

And these are his reasons wherewith he would prove / that the sacraments / and
therefore also the sacrament of baptism / may be mynistred in a private house.
He has certain other to prove that women may baptize / whereof the first is
in the. 93. page / and that is / that Sephora Moses wife / circumcised her
child / whereunto I have answered partly before / that particular examples /
especially contrary to general rules / are not to be followed / and will
further answer / if I first admonish the reader / whereupon this baptism of
mydwiues and in private houses rose / that when we know of how rotten a stock
it came / the fruit it self may be more loathsome unto us. It first therefore
rose upon a false interpretation of the place of S. John. Unless a man be
borne again of water and of the spirit, 3. John. 5.
he can not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Where certain do interpreate
the word water for the material and elementall water / wherewith men are
washed / when as our savior Christ takes water there / by a translation or
borrowed speech / for the spirit of God / the effect whereof it shadoweth out.
For even as 3. Math. 11.
in an other place by the fire and the spirit / he means nothing but the
spirit of God / which purges and purifyeth as the fire does: so in this place
/ by the water and the spirit / he means nothing else / but the spirit of
God / which cleanses the filth of sin / and cools the broyling heat of an
unquiet conscience / as water washes the thing which is foul / and quenches
the heat of the fire. Secondarily / this error came by a false and unnecessary
conclusyon drawn of that place. For although the scripture should say / that
none can be saved / but those which have the spirit of God / and are baptized
with material and elementall water / yet ought it to be understood of
those which can conveniently and orderly be brought to baptism / as the
scripture saying / that who so does not believe the gospel / is already
condemned / means this sentence of those which can 3. John. 18.
hear the gospel / and have discretion to understand it when they hear it /
and can not here shut under this condemnation / either those that be borne
deaf / and so remain / or little infantes / or natural fools / that have no
wit to conceive what is preached.

And hereupon * S. Augustine concludes / that all not baptized are condemned
/ 106. Epist. ad Bonifac. In lib. de meritis, and remis. peccar. 1. ca. 24.
which is as absurdly concluded of him / as that of our savior Christ's words
(except one eat the flesh of the son of man / he has not life) he
concludes that whatsoever he be which receives not the sacrament of the
supper / is damned.

Upon this false conclusion of S. Augustine / has risen this profanation of
the sacrament of baptism / in being mynistred in pryuate houses / and by women
or lay men / as also upon his other absurd conclusion / sprung a horrible
abuse of the Lords supper / whylest they did thrust the bread and wine into
young infants mouths / for that men were persuaded / that otherwise if their
children should die before they were baptized or had received the supper /
they were damned for ever. And what better token can there be / that this was
the cause of this blind baptism / then that the papists from whom this
baptism by women is translated / were of the same judgment / and for that
cause brought in their baptism by women. Hereupon may be added an other cause
/ which is that as (when the church began not only to declyne / but to fall
away from the sincerity of relygion) it borrowed a number of other prophanations
of the Heathen: so also it borrowed this. For as the Heathen had women priests
/ so it would have also her women priests / and that this was an other
occasion of bringing in the baptism by women / it appears by your Clement /
if he can speak any truth. 3. Lib. 9. ca.


Now I return to the example of Sephora / and say that the unlawfulness of that
fact does appear suffyciently in that she did it / before her husband Moses /
which was a Prophet of the Lord / and to whom that office of circumcysion did
appertain: so that unless M. Doctor would have mydwyues baptize in the
presence of the bishop or the mynister / there is no cause why he should
allege this place. Besides that she did cut of that foreskin of the infant
not of mind to obey the commandment of God / or for the salvation of the
child / but in a choler only / to the end that her husband might be eased
and have release: which mind appears in her / both by her words / and by
casting away in anger the forskin which she had cut of. And if it be said
that the event declared that the act pleased God / because that Moses forthwith
waxed better / and was recovered of his sickness / I have showed before / how
if we measure things by the event / we shall oftentimes justify the wicked /
and take the righteousness of the righteous from them. An other reason he has
/ which is / that the dignity of the sacraments does not depend upon the man
/ whether he be mynister or no mynister / good or evil.

In deed upon this point whether he be a good or an evil mynister it
depends not / but on this point / whether he be a mynister or no / depends
not only the dignity / but also ye being of the sacrament: so that I take the
baptism of women / to be no more the holy sacrament of baptism / then I take
any other daily or ordinary washing of the child. Neither let any man
think / that I have at unawares slipped into this asseueration / or that I
have forgotten / that sone after the times of the Apostles / it was the use of
certain churches / that deacons should baptize in the time of necessity (as
they call it.) For as for the baptism of deacons / I hold it to be lawful /
for because although (as it is with us) they give him the name of deacon / yet
in deed he is / as he then was in the elder times a mynister / and not a
deacon. And although he did then provide for the poor / and so had two
functions (which was not meet) yet his office ought to be esteemed of the
principal part of his function / which was preaching and mynistring of the
Sacraments / in certain cases. And as for the baptysing by lay men /
consydering that it is not only against the word of God / but also founded upon
a false ground / and upon an imagined necessity (which is none in deed) it
moves me nothing at all / although it be very ancient / for so much as the
substance of the sacrament depended cheefely of the institution and word of
God / which is the form / and as it were the life of the Sacrament / of which
institution this is one / and of the chief parts / that it should be
celebrated by a mynister. For although part of the institution / in that the
name of the holy Trinity is called upon / be observed: yet if the whole
institution be not / it is no more a Sacrament / then the papists communion
was / which celebrating in one kind / took a part of the institution / and
left the other. And for so much as S. Paul says / Romans 10. 15.
that a man can not preach which is not sent / no not although he speak the
words of the scripture and interpreate them: so I can not see / how a man can
baptize / unless that he be sent to that end / although he pour water and
rehearse the words which are to be rehearsed in the ministry of baptism. I
know there be diverse difficultyes in this question / and therefore I was loathe
to enter into it / but that the answearer sets down so confidently / that
it makes no matter for the truth of baptism / whether he be mynister or no
mynister / and so whether one have a calling or no calling. Wherein
notwithstanding he does not only by his often handling of one thing / confound
his reader / but him self also / and forgets that he is in an other
question then which is propounded. For although it should be granted him /
that the sacrament does not depend upon that / yet has he not that which he
would have / that women may baptize. For it is one thing to say the baptism
which is mynistred by women / is good and effectual / and an other thing to
say that it is lawful for women to mynister baptism. For there is no man
doubts: but that the baptism which is mynistred by an heretical mynister is
effectual / and yet I think that M. Doctor will not say / that therefore an
heretical mynister may baptize / and that it is lawful for heretics to
baptize in the church. And therefore men must not only take heed (as M. Doctor
says) that they usurp not that which they are not called unto / but they must
also take heed that they receive not functions and charges upon them / whereof
they are not capable / although they be thereunto called.

In the 153. page M. Bucers censure upon the communion book is cited / for the
allowance of that it has touching private baptism / and consequently of the
baptism by women. It may be / that as M. Bucer although otherwise very learned
has other gross absurdities / so he may have that. But it had been for the
credit of your cause / if you had showed that out of those wrytinges / which
are publyshed and known to be his / and not out of those whereof men may doubt /
whether ever he wrote any such or no: and if he wrote / whether they be
corrupted by those into whose hands they came. And if you would take any
advantage of M. Bucers testimony / considering y^ a witness is a public
person / you should have brought him out of your study into the Stationers shop
/ where he might have been common to others as well as to you / where by his
style and manner of writing / as it were by his gestures and countenaunces / and
by those things that go before and come after / as it were by his head and his
feet / we might the better know whether it were the true Bucer or no. For
although I will not say but that this may be Bucers doing / yet it seems very
strange / that Bucer should not only contrary to the learned writers now / but
also contrary to all learned antiquity / and contrary to the practice of the
church / whilst there was any tolerable estate / allow of women's baptising. De
^irginive.
Tertullian says it is not permitted unto a woman to speak in the church /
nor to teach / nor to baptize / nor to do any work of a man / much less of
a mynister. Lib. de Bapt.
And in an other place / although he do permit it to be done of lay men in the
time of necessity (as it is termed) yet he gives not that license to the
woman. Epiph. li. 1. contra hereses.
Epiphanius vpbraydeth Marcian that he suffered women to baptize / and. Lib. 2.
vbi. de phrygib. and Priscil.
in an other book he derydeth them that they made women bishops / and. Lib. 3.
in an other book he says / it was not granted onto the holy mother of
Christ to baptize her son. 1. Li. de merit. and remis. peccata 24. ca.
Augustine although he were of that mind / that children could not be saved
without baptism / yet in the time of necessity (as it is called) he does not
allow either of baptism in private houses or by women / but when there was
danger the women hasted to carry the children unto the church / and although.
Contra ep. parmen. lib. 2. 13. cap.
he do seem to allow of the baptism of a lay man in the time of necessity /
yet there also he mentions not women's baptism / and further he doubts
whether the child should be baptized again / which was baptized by a lay man.
Tom. 1. con, ca. 100.
And in ye fourth council of Carthage it is simply without exception decreed /
y^ a woman ought not to baptize. The authors of the Admonition object that
necessity of salvation is tied to the sacraments by this means / and that
men are confirmed in that old error / that no man can be saved with out
baptism / which in deed is true. For must it not be thought to be done of
necessity / and upon great extremity / for the doing whereof the orders that
God has set (that it should be done in the congregation / and by the mynister
of the gospel) are broken? Yes verily. And I will further say / that although
that the infants which dye without baptism should be assuredly damned (which
is most false) yet ought not the orders which God has set in his church / to
be broken after this sort. For as the salvation of men ought to be dear unto
us: so the glory of God which consists in that his orders be kept / ought to
be much more dear / that if at any time the controversy could be between his
glory and our salvation / our salvation ought to fall that his glory may stand.

Now in the 187. page M. Doctor answeareth heereunto / that this implies no
more that the salvation is tied to the sacraments / then when it is taught
that infants must be baptized / and not tarry until they come to the age of
discretion. Which how truly it is spoken / when as the one has ground of the
scripture / the other has none / the one approved by the continual / and
almost the general practice of the church / the other used in the corrupt and
rotten estate thereof / let all men judge. Therefore for so much as the
mynistery of the word and sacraments go together / and that the mynistery of
the word may not be committed unto women / and for that this evil custom has
risen first of a false understanding of the scripture / and then of a false
conclusion of that untrue understanding (which is / that they can not be saved
which are not baptized) and for that the authors them selves of that error /
did never seek no remedy of the mischief in women's or private baptim: And
last of all for that if there were any remedy against that mischefe in such
kind of baptism / yet it ought not to be used / being against the institution
of God and his glory / I conclude that the private baptism / and by women is
utterly unlawful. There follows the private communion which is found fault
with / both for the place wherein it is mynistred / and for the small number of
communicants which are admitted / by the bocke of service. Touching the place
before is spoken sufficiently / it reasteth to consider of the number. But
before I come to that / I will speak some thing of the causes and beginning of
receiving in houses / and of the mynistring of the Communion unto sick folks.
It is not to be denied / but that this abuse is very ancient / and was in
Justin Martyrs time / in Tertullians and Cyprians time / even as also there
were other abuses crept into the supper of the Lord / and that very gross / as
the mingling of water with wine / and therein also a necessity and great
mystery placed / as it may appear both by Iustine Martyr and Cyprian. Which I
therefore by the way do admonish the reader of / that the antiquity of this
abuse of pryuate communion / be not prejudicial to the truth / no more then
the mingling of water / with that opynion of necessity / that those fathers
had of it / is or ought to be prejudicial to that that we use in mynistring
the cup with pure wine according to the instytution. I say therefore that
this abuse was ancient / and rose upon these causes. First of all in the
prymitiue church the dyscipline of the church was so severe and so extreme /
that if any which professed the truth / and were of the body of the church /
did through infirmity deny the truth / and joined him self unto the idolatrous
service / although he repenting came again unto the church / yet was he not
received to the communion of the Lords supper any more. And yet lying in
extremity of sickness / and ready to depart this life / if he did require the
communion in token that the church had forgeuen the fault / and was reconcyled
altogether unto that person that had so fallen / they granted that he might be
partaker of it / as may appear by the story of Serapion. Another cause was
Eusebius. lib. 6. cap. 43.
that which was before alleged / which is the false opynion which they had
conceived / that all those were condemned / that received not the supper of the
Lord / and therefore when as those that were (as they called the^ cathecumeni)
which is young nouices in relygion never admitted to the supper / or young
children fell sick daungerously / they mynistred the supper of the Lord unto
them / least they should want their voyage victual (as they termed it) which
abuse notwithstanding was neither so ancient as the other / nor so general.
And there wanted not good men which declared their mislyking / and did decree
against both the abuses / and against all manner communicating in private
houses. As in the council of * Laodicea it Tom. 1. canon. 58.
was ordained that neither bishop nor elder should make any oblation / that was
/ mynister any communion in houses. Besides therefore that I have before showed
the unlawfulness generally of mynistring the sacrament in private places /
seeing that the custom of mynistring this supper unto the sick / rose upon
corrupt causes and rotten foundations / and considering also (God be praised)
in these times there are none driven by fear to renounce the truth / whereupon
any such excommunication should ensue / which in the extremity of sickness
should be mitigated after this sort (for no man now that is in extreme
sickness / is cast down or else assaulted with this temptation yt he is cut
of from the church) I say these things considered / it follows that this
mynistring of communion in private houses and to the sick is unlawful / as
that which rose upon evil grounds: and if it were lawful / yet that now in
these times of peace / and when the sick are not excommunicated / there is no
use of it. And so it appears / how little the custom of the old church does
help M. Doctor in this point.

And as for that he says Peter Martyr and Bucer / do allow the communion
exhibited to the sick persons / when he shows that / he shall have answer.
For where he says he has declared it in an other treatise / either ye Printer
has left out ye treatise / or M. Doc. wonderfully forgets him self / or
else he means some odd thing / that he has written / and laid up in some
corner of his study. For surely there is no such saying in all his book before
/ nor yet after / so far as I can find.

Now remains to be spoken of the number of communicants / and that there is
fault in the appoynting of the service book / not only for that it admits
in the time of plage / that one with ye mynister may celebrate the supper of
the Lord in the house / but for that it ordayneth a communion in the church /
when of a great number which assemble there / it admits three or four / the
abuse and inconvenience whereof may thus be considered. The holy sacrament of
the supper of the Lord / is not only a seal and confirmation of the promises
of God unto us / but also a profession of our conjunction / as well with Christ
our savior and with God / as also (as S. Paul teaches) a declaration and
profession that we 1. Cor. 10. 17.
are at one with our brethren: so that it is first a sacrament of the knitting
of all the body generally / and of every member particularly with the head /
and then of the members of the body one with an other. Now therefore seeing
that every particular church and body of Gods people / is a representation /
and as it were a lively portraiture of the whole church and body of Christ / it
follows that that which we can not do with all the church scattered
throughout the whole world (for the distances of places whereby we are severed)
we ought to do with that church whereunto God has raunged us / as much as
possibly or conveniently may be. The departing therefore of the rest of the
church from those three or four / is an open profession that they have no
communion / fellowshippe / nor unity with them / that do communicate: and
likewise of those three or four / that they have none with the rest that join
not them selves thereunto: when as both by the many grapes making one cup /
and corns making one loaf / that whole church being many parsons / are called
as to the unity which they have one with an other / and altogether amongst
them selves: so to the declaration and profession of it / by receiving one with
an other / and altogether amongst them selves: And as if so be that we do not
celebrate as we may possibly and conveniently / the supper of the Lord / we
thereby utter our want of love toward the Lord which has redeemed us: so if
we do not communicate together with the church / so far forth as we may do
conveniently / we betray the want of our love that we have one toward an
other. And therefore S. Paul dryuing heereunto / wills 1. Cor. 11. 33.
that one should tarry for an other / reprehending that when one preuenteth and
comes before an other / saying: that that is to take every man his own
supper / and not to celebrate the Lords supper. Not that so many men or women
as there came / so many tables were / for that had not been possible in so
great assemblyes / but that they sorted them selves into certain companyes /
and that they came scattering one after an other / and that in stead of making
one supper of the Lord / they did make diverse.

These things being considered / the reason which the Admonition uses in the
185. page / where this matter is spoken of / which is / drink you all of this
/ is not so rydiculous as M. Doctor makes it. For although that it do neither
prove that 12. or 20. or any other definite number must of necessity receive /
yet it proves that as all they which were present / did communicate: And so as
many as in the church are fit to receive the sacraments / or may conveniently
receive them together / should follow that example in celebrating the supper
together. And it is probably to be thought / that if our savior Christ had not
been restrained by the law of God touching the passover unto his own family
and to as many only as would serve to eat up a Lamb by them selves / that
he would Exodus 12. 3.
have celebrated his supper / amongst other of his disciples and professoures
of his doctrine. But for so much as it was meet that he should celebrate
his supper there and then / where and when he did celebrate his passover /
for the cause before by me alleged / it pleased him to keep his first supper
with the fewer / for that the law of communication unto the passover / which
was joined with the supper / would not admit any greater number of
communicants / then was sufficient to eat up the passover.

And although it be clear and plain / that when it is said drink ye all
of this / and tarry one for an other / these sayings are meant of that
particulare congregation or assembly / which assemble themselves together to be
taught by one mouth of the mynister: yet I have therefore put this caution (as
much as may be possible) least any man should cavil / as though I would have
no communion / until all the godly through the world should meet together.
Likewise I have put this caution (as much as may be conveniently) for although
it be possible / that a perticulare church may communicate at one table in one
day and together: yet may the same be inconvenient for diverse causes. As if
the number should be very great / so that to have them all communicate together
/ it would require such a long time / as the tarying out of the whole action /
would hazard either the life / or at least the health of diverse there. Again
/ for as much as other some being at the church / it is meet that other
should be at home / upon occasyon of infantes and such like things / as
require the presence of some to tarry at home. In these cases and such like /
the inconveniences do deliver us from the gilte of uncharitableness / and
forsaking the fellowship of the church / for that we do not here severe our
selves / but are by good and just causes severed: which gilte we shall never
escape / if beside such necessary causes we pretend those that are not / or
having not so much as a pretense / yet notwythstanding separate our selves /
as the daily practice thorough out the church does show.

But it may be objected / that in this point the book of Common prayer is not
in fault / which does not only not forbid that all the church should receive
together / but also by a good and godly exhortation moves those that be
present / that they should not depart / but communicate altogether. It is true
that it does not forbid / and that there is godly exhortation for that purpose
/ but that (I say) is not enough / for neither should it suffer that three or
four should have a communion by them selves (so many being in the church meet
to receive / and to whom the supper of the Lord does of right appertain) and
it ought to provide / that those which would wythdrawe them selves / should
be by Ecclesiastical discipline / at all times / and now also under a godly
Prince by civil punishment brought to communicate with their brethren. And
this is the law of God / and this is now and has been heretofore the practice
of churches reformed. All men understand that the passover was a figure of the
Lords supper / and that there should be as straight bonds to bind men to
celebrate the remembrance of our spiritual deliverance / as there was to
remember the deliverance out of Egypt. But whosoever did not then communicate
with the rest at that time / when the passover was eaten / was excommunicated
/ as it may appear in the book of Numbers / where he Number. 9. 13.
says / that whosoever did not communicate being clean / his soul should be
cut off from amongst the people of God. Therefore this neglect / or contempt
rather of the Lords supper / ought to be punished with no les punishment /
especially when as (after the church has proceeded in that order which our
savior Christ appoynteth of admonishing) they be not sorry for their fault / and
promise amendment. And that this was the custom of the churches / it may
appear by the. 9. of those canons / which are fathered of the apostles / where
it is decreed that all the Conc. Apo. canon. 9.
faithful that entered into the congregation / and heard the scriptures red /
and did not tarry out the prayers and the holy Communion / should be as those
which were causers of disorders in the church / separated from the church / (or
as it is translated of an other) deprived of the Communion. Also in the
council of Braccara it Conc. 2. Bracca cap. 83. tom. 2.
was decreed / that if any entering into the church of God / heard the
Scriptures / and afterward of wantonness or losenes / wythdrewe him self from
the communion of the sacrament / and so brake the rule of discipline in the
reverend sacraments / should be put out of the church / till such time as he
had by good fruits declared his repentance.

But here also may rise an other doubt of the former words of Moses in the
book of Numbers / for seeing that he makes this exception (if they be clean)
it may be said / that those that depart / do not feel themselves mete to
receive / and therefore depart / the other.iij. or.iiij. or more / feel
themselves meet and disposed for that purpose: whereupon it may seem that it
is neither reason to compel those to come / which feel not themselves meet /
nor to reject them that feel that good disposition and preparation in
themselves. For answer whereunto / we must understand that the uncleanness which
Moses speaks of / was such as men could not easily avoid / and whereunto they
might fall sometimes by necessary duty / as by handling their dead / which
they were by the rule of charity bound to burye / sometimes by touching at
unawares a dead body / or by sitting in the place where some unclean body had
sitten / or by touching such things which the law judged unclean / which thing
cannot be alleged in those that are now of the church. For as many as be of it
/ and wythall of such discretion as are able to prove and examine themselves /
can have no excuse at all / if they may be at the church / to withdraw
themselves from the holy supper of the Lord. For if they will say that they be
not meet / it may be answered unto them / that it is their own fault: and
further / if they be not meet to receive the holy sacrament of the supper /
they are not meet to hear the word of God / they are not meet to be
partakers of the prayers of the church / and if they be for one / they are also
for the other. For with that boldness / and with that duetye or lawfulnes (I
speak of those which are of the church / and of discretion to examine
themselves) I say with what lawfulnes they may offer themselves to the prayers
/ and to the hearing of the word of God / they may also offer themselves unto
the Lords supper. And to whomsoever of the^ the Lord will communicate himself
by preaching the word / unto the same he will not refuse to communicate himself
by receiving of the sacraments. For whosoever is of Gods household and familye
/ he need not be afraid to come to the Lords table / nor dout but that the
Lord will feed him there: and whatsoever he be that is a membre of the body of
Christ / may be assured that he receives life from Christ the head as well by
the arteries and condints of the supper of the Lord / as by the preaching of
the word of God. So that it must needs follow / that the not receiving of those
which depart out of the church / when there is any communion celebrated /
proceeds either of vain and superstitious fear / growing of gross ignorance
of themselves and of the holy sacraments: or else of an intolerable negligence
or rather contempt / of the which neither the one nor the other should be either
borne with or nourished / either by permitting.iij. or.iiij. to communicate
alone / or else in letting them which depart / go so easily away with so great a
fault / which ought to be severely punished. And upon this either contempt or
superstitious fear drawn from the papists Lenton preparation of. 40. days /
eareshrift / displing. etc. it comes to pas / that men receiving the supper
of the Lord but seldom / when they fall sick must have the supper ministered
unto them in their houses / which otherwise being once every weke received
before / should not bread any such unquietness in the^ / when they can not come
to receive it. Although as I have before showed / if they had never received it
before / yet that private receiving were not at any hand to be suffered. And
thus having declared what I think to be faulty in the communion book in this
point / and the reasons why / and with all answered to that which either M.
doctor alleges in this place of the. 80. and. 81. and likewise in the. 152.
and. 185. pages touching this matter / I come now unto that which is called the
Iewishe purifying by the admonition / and by the service book before time the
purification of women.

Now to the churching of women / in the which title yet kept / there seems to
be hid a great part of the Jewish purification. For like as in the old law she
that had brought forth a child / was holden unclean / until such time as
she Leu. 12. 2. 4. 5
came to the temple to show her self after she had brought forth a man or a
woman: so this term of churching of her / canseme to import nothing else / the^
a banishment / and (as it were) a certain excommunication from the church /
during the space yt is between the time of her delivery / and of her coming
unto y^ church. For what does else this churching implie / but a restoring her
unto y^ church / which ca^ not be without some bar or shutting forth presupposed.
It is also called ye thanks giving / but the principal title which is the
directory of this part of the Liturgy / and placed in the top of the leaf /
as ye which the translator best liked of is (churching of women.) To pas by ye
/ that it will have the^ come as nigh the communion table as may be / as they
came before to y^ high altar (because I had spoken once generally against such
ceremonies) y^ of all other is most Jewish / and approaches nerest unto the
Jewish purification / y^ she is commanded to offer accustomed offerings. Wherein
besides that / the very word offering caryeth with it a strong sent and suspision
of a sacrifice (especially being uttered simply without any addition / it can not
be without danger / that the book makes the custom of ye popish church (which
was so corrupt) to be ye rule and measure of this offering. And although the
meaning of the book is not / ye it should be any offering for sin / yet this
manner of speaking may be a stu^bling stock in the way of y^ ignorant and
simple / and the wicked and obstinate thereby are confirmed and hardened in their
corruptions. The best which can be answered in this case is / ye it is for ye
relief of ye minister / but the^ it should be remembered / first that the
minister lives not any more of offerings. Secondarily / yt the payment of the
ministers wages is not so convenient either in the church or before all the
people. And thirdly / y^ thereby we fall into y^ fault which we condemn in
popery / and that is / y^ besides the ordinary living appointed for the service
of the priests in ye who^e / they took for their several services of mass /
baptism / burying / churching. etc. several rewards / which thing being of ye
service book well abolished in certain other things / I cannot see what good
cause there should be / to retain it in this and certain other. Now whereas m. D.
says yt the place of the. 15. of the Acts alleged by the admonition / makes
nothing against this / he should have considered / that if it be a Jewish
ceremony (as they suppose it /) it is to be abolished utterly. For it being
showed there ye all the ceremonial law of Moses is don away through our savior
Christ / this also a part thereof must needs be therein comprised. And whereas
he says / that it being nothing else but a thanks giving for her deliverance /
can not be therefore but christian and very godly / I answer ye if there should
be solemn and expres giving of thanks in the church for every benefit / either
equal or greater the^ this / which any singular person in the church does
receive / we should not only have no preaching of the word / nor ministering of
the sacraments / but we should not have so much leisure as to do any corporal or
bodily work / but should be like unto those heretics / which were called of the
Syriake word Messalians, or continual Theodor. lib. 4. 11. ca.
prayers / and which did nothing else but pray. For the Psalm. 121. spoken of
in the 155. page / it being showed that it is not meet to have any such
solemn thanks giving / it is needeles to debate of the Psalm / wherewyth the
thanks giving should be made. And whereas in. 101. and. 102. pages unto the
admonition / obiecting that the coming in the veil to the church more then /
the^ at other times / is a token of shame or some folly committed / M. D.
iestingly leaves the matter to the wome^s answer. A little true knowledge of
divinity would have taught him / that the bringing in or usurping without
authority any ceremony in the congregation / is both an earnester matter /
then may be iested at / and a waightier then should be permitted unto the
discretion of every woman / considering that the same has been so horribly
abused in time of poperye.

The holy days follow / of which M. Doctor says / that so they be not used
superstitiously or unprofitably they may be commanded. I have showed before /
that they were. If they were so indifferent as they are made / yet being kept
of the papists which are the enemies of God / they ought to be abolished. And
if it were as easy a matter to pull out the superstition of the observing of
those holidays out of men's hearts / as it is to protest and to teach that
they are not commanded for any religion to be put in them / or for any to make
conscience of the observing of them / as though there weresome necessary
worship of God in the keeping of them: then were they much more tolerable. But
when as the continuance of them does norishe wicked superstition in the minds
of men / and that the doctrine which should remedy the superstition through the
fewnes and skarcitye of able ministers / can not come to the most part of them
which are infected with this disease / and that also where it is preached / the
fruit thereof is in part hindered / whylest the common people attend oftentimes
rather to that which is done / the^ to that which is taught / being a thing
indifferent (as it is said) it ought to be abolyshed / as that which is not
only not fittest to hold the people in the sincere worshypping of God / but
also as that which keeps them in their former blindness and corrupt opinions
which they have conceived of such holy days. And if they had been never abused
neither by the Papists nor by the Jews (as they have been and are daily) yet
such making of holy days is never without some great danger of brynging in
some evil and corrupt opinions into the minds of men. I will use an example
in one / and that the chief of holy days / and most generally and of longest
time observed in ye church / which is the feast of Easter / which was kept of
some more days of some fewer. How many thousands are there / I will not say of
the ignorant papists / but of those also which profess the gospel / which
when they have celebrated those days with dilygent heed taken unto their life /
and with some earnest devotion in praying and hearing the word of God / do not
by and by think / that they have well celebrated the feast of Easter / and yet
have they thus notably deceived them selves. For S. Paul teaches that the
celebrating 1. Cor. 5. 8.
of the feast of the christians Easter / is not as the Jews Easter was / for
certain days / but shows that we must keep this feast all the days of our
life in the unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth. By which we see that
the observing of the feast of Easter for certain days in the year / does pull
out of our minds or ever we be aware / the doctrine of the gospel / and
causes us to rest in that near consideration of our duties for the space of
a few days / which should be extended to alour life. But besides the
incommodities that rise of making such holy days / and continuing of those
which are so horribly abused / where it is confessed that they are not
necessary: besides this / I say the matter is not so indifferent as it is made.
I confess that it is in the power of the church to appoint so many days in the
week or in the year (in the which the congregation shall assemble to hear the
word of God / and receive the sacraments / and offer up prayers unto God) as it
shall think good according to those rules which are before alleged. But y^ it
has power to make so many holy days (as we have) wherein no man may work any
part of the day / and wherein men are commanded to cease from their daily
vocations of plowing and exercising their handy crafts. etc. that I deny to be
in the power of the church. For proof whereof I will take the fourth
commandment / and no other interpretation of it / then M. doctor allows of
in the. 174. page / which is / that God licenseth / and leaves it at the
liberty of every man to work six days in the week / so that he rest the
seventh day. Seeing that therefore that the Lord has left it to all men at
liberty / that they might labor (if they think good) six days: I say the
church nor no man can take this liberty away from them / and drive them to a
necessary rest of the body. And if it be lawful to abridge the liberty of the
church in this point / and in stead that the Lord says six days thou may
labor if thou will / to say thou shall not labor six days: I do not see why
the church may not as well / whereas the Lord says thou shall rest the seventh
day / command that thou shall not rest the seventh day. For if the church may
restrain the liberty that God has given the^ / it may take away the yoke also
that God has put upon them.

And whereas you say in the. 173. page / that notwithstanding this fourth
commandment / the Jews had certain other feasts which they observed: in
deed the Lord which gave this general law / might make as many exceptions as
he thought good / and so long as he thought good. But it follows not because
the Lord did it / that therefore the church may do it / unless it has
commandment and authority from God so to do. As when there is any general
plague or judgment of God either upon the church / or coming toward it /
the Lord commands in such a case that they should sanctify a general
fast / and proclaim Joel. 2. 15.
ghnatsarah, which signifies a prohibition or forbidding of ordinary works /
and is the same Hebrewe word wherwyth those feasts days are noted in the law
wherein they should rest. The reason of which commandment of the Lord was /
that as they abstained that day as much as might be conveniently from meat / so
they might abstain from their daily works / to the end they might bestow
the whole day in hearing the word of God / and humbling themselves in the
congregation / confessing their faults / and desiring the Lord to turn away
from his fearce wrath. In this case the church having commandment to make a
holy day / may and ought to do it / as the church which was in Babylon did /
during the time of their captivity: but where it is destitute of a
commandment / it may not presume by any decree to restrain that liberty
which the Lord has given.

Now that I have spoken generally of holy days / I come unto the apostles and
other saints days / which are kept with us. And though it were lawful for
the church to ordain holy days to our savior Christ or to the blessed
Trinity: yet it is not therefore lawful to institute holy days to the apostles
and other saints / or to their remembrance. For although I confess as much as
you say in the. 153. page / that the church of England does not mean by this
keeping of holy days that the saints should be honored / or as you allege
in the. 175. and. 176. pages / that with us the saints are not prayed unto / or
that it does propou^d them as meritorious / yet that is not enough. For as we
reason against the popish purgatory / that it is therefore naught / for as much
as neither in the old Testament nor in the new / there is any mention of
prayer at any time for the dead: so may it be reasoned against these holy days
ordained for the remembrance of the saints / that for so much as the old
people did never keep any feast or holy day for the remembrance either of
Moses or Daniel / or Job / or Abraham / or David / or any other / how holy or
excellent so ever they were: nor the apostles nor the churches in their time
never instituted any either to keep the remembrance of Stephen / or of the
virgin Mary / or of John Baptist / or of any other notable and rare personage /
that the instituting and erecting of them now / and this attempt by the
churches which followed / which have not such certain and undoubted interpreaters
of the will of God / as the prophets and apostles were which lived in those
churches / is not without some note of presumption / for that it undertakes
those things which the primitive church in the apostles times (having greater
gifts of the spirit of God then they that followed them had) durst not venture
upon.

Moreover I have showed before / what force the name of every thing has to
cause men to think so of every thing / as it is named / and therefore although
you say in the. 175. page that in calling these holy days the days of such
or such a Saint / there is nothing else meante but that the Scriptures which
are that day red / concern that saint / and contain either his calling /
preaching / persecution / martyrdom. etc. yet every one does not understand so
much. For besides that the corrupt custom of popery has carried their minds
to an other interpretation / the very name and appellation of the day teaches
otherwise. For seeing that the days dedicated to the Trinity / and those that
are consecrate to our savior Christ / are in that they be called Trinity day or
the Nativity day of our savior Christ / by and by taken to be instituted to the
honor of our sauyor Christ and of the Trinity: so likewise the people / when
it is called S. Paul's day / or the blessed virgin Maryes day / can understand
nothing thereby / but that they are instituted to the honor of S. Paul or of
the virgin Mary / unless they be otherwise taught. And if you say let them so be
taught / I have answered that the teaching in this land can not by any order
which is yet taken come to the most part of those / which have drunk this
poison: and where it is taught / it were good that the names were abolyshed /
that they should not help to vnteach that / which the preaching teaches in
this behalf.

Furthermore / seeing the holy days be ceremonies of the church / I see not
why we may not here renew Augustines complaint / yt the estate of the Jews
was more tolerable then ours is (I speak in this point of holy days) for if
their holy days and ours be accounted / we shallbe found to have more then
double as many holy days as they had. And as for all the commodityes which we
receive by them / whereby M. doctor goes about to prove the goodness and
lawfulnes of their institution / as that the scriptures are there red and
expounded / the patience of those saints in their persecution and Martyrdom
is to the edifying of the church remembered / and yearly renewed: I say / that
we might have all those commodities without all those dangers which I have
spoken of / and without any keeping of yearly memory of those saints / and (as
it falls out) in better and more profitable sort. For as I said before of
the keeping of Easter / that it tyeth / and (as it were) fettereth a meditation
of the Easter to a few days / which should reach to all our age and time of
our life: so those celebrations of the memories of saints and martyrs /
streighten our consideration of them unto those days / which should
continually be thought of / and daily as long as we live. And if that it be
thought so good and profitable a thing that this remembrance of them should be
upon those days / wherein they are supposed to have dyed / yet it follows not
therefore that after this remembrance is celebrated by hearing the scriptures
concerning them / and prayers made to follow their constancy / that all the
rest of the day should be kept holy in such sort / as men should be debarred
of their bodily labors / and of exercising their daily vocations.

Now where as master Doctor cites Augustine and Jerome / to prove that in
the Churches in their times / there were holy days kept besides the Lords
day / he might have also cited Ignatius and Tertullian / and Cyprian / which
are of greater auncienty / and would have made more for the credit of his cause
/ seeing he measures all his truth almost through the whole book / by the
crooked measure and yard of time. For it is not to be denied / but this keeping
of holy days (especially of the Easter and Pentecost) are very ancient / and
that these holy days for the remembrance of Martyrs / were used of long time.
But these abuses were no auncienter then other were / groser also then this was
/ as I have before declared / and were easy further to be showed / if need
required. And therefore I appeal from these examples to the scriptures / and
to the examples of the perfectest church that ever was / which was that in the
apostles times. And yet also I have to say / that the observation of those
feasts first of all / was much better then of later times. For Socrates
(confessing / that neither Lib. 5. c. 22.
our savior Christ nor the apostles / did decree or institute any holy days
/ or lay any yoke of bondage upon the necks of those which came to the
preaching) adds further / that they did use first to observe the holy days
by custom / and that as every man was disposed at home. Which thing if it had
remained in that freedom / that it was done by custom / and not by
commandment / at the will of every one / and not by constraint / it had been
much better then it is now / and had not drawn such dangers upon the
posteritye / as did after ensue / and we have the experience of.

As touching M. Bucers / M. Bullingers and Illiricus allowance of them / if
they mean such a celebration of them / as that in those days the people may
be assembled and those parts of the scriptures which concern them whose
remembrance is solemnised / red / and expounded / and yet men not debarred
after from their daily works / it is so much the les matter: if otherwise /
that good leave they give the churches to dissent from them in that point / I
do take it granted unto me / being by the grace of God one of the church.

Although as touching M. Bullenger it is to be observed / since the time that
he wrote that upon the Romans / there are about.xxxv. years / sythens which
time although he hold still that the feasts dedicated unto the Lord (as of
the Nativity / Easter / and Pentecost) may be kept / yet he denies flatly that
it is lawful to keep holy the days of the apostles / as it appears in the
confession of the Tigurine church joined with others. Confess. eccle. Tigur.
and aliarum eccle. c. 24.


As for M. Calvin / as the practice of him and the church where he lived was
and is / to admit no one holy day besides the Lords day: so can it not be
showed out of any part of his works (as I think) that he approved those holy
days / which are now in question. He says in deed in his Institution: that
he will not condemn those churches which use them: No more do we the church of
England / neither in this nor in other things / which are mere to be
reformed. For it is one thing to mislike / another thing to condemn / and it
is one thing to condemn some thing in the church / and an other thing to
condemn the church for it. And as for the places cited out of the epistles to
the Galathians and Collossians / there is no mention of any holy days / either
to saints or to any other. And it appears also that he defends not other
churches / but the church of Geneua / and answeareth not to those which object
against the keeping of saints days or any holy days (as they are called)
besides the Lords day / but against those which would not have the Lords day
kept still / as a day of rest from bodily labor / as it may appear both by his
place upon the Collossians / and especially in that which is alleged out of
his Institutions. And that he means nothing les then such holy days / as
you take upon you to defend / it may appear first in the place of the
Colossians / where he says that the days of rest which are used of them /
are used for policy sake. Now it is well known / that as it is policy and a
way to preserve the estate of things / and to keep the^ in a good continuance
and succes / that as well the beasts as the men which labor six days should
rest the seventh: so it tends to no policy nor wealth of the people or
preservation of good order / that there should be so many days / wherein men
should cease from work / being a thing which breeds idleness / and
consequently poverty / besides other disorders and vices / which always go in
company with idleness. And in the place of his Institutions he declares him
self yet more plainly / when he says / that those odd holy days then are
without superstition / when they be ordained only for the observing of
discipline and order. Whereby he gives to understand / that he would have them
no further holy days / then for the time which is bestowed in the exercise of
the discipline and order of the church / and that for the rest / they should
be altogether / as other days / free to be labored in. And so it appears /
that the holy days ascribed to Saints by the service book / is a just cause
why a man can not safely without exception subscribe unto the service.

Now whereas master Doctor says / it makes no matter whether these things
be taken out of the Portuis / so they be good. etc. I have proved first they
are not good / then if they were / yet being not necessary / and abused
horribly by the papists / other being as good / and better then they / ought
not to remain in the church. And as for Ambrose saying all truth of whom so
ever it be said / is of the holy ghost: it I were disposed to move questions
/ I could demand of him which cares not of whom he have the truth / so he
have it / what our savior Mark. 1. 24. Luke. 4. 41.
Christ meant to refuse the testimony of Devils / when they gave a clear
testimony that he was the son of God / and the holy one: and what S. Paul
meant to be angry / and to take it so grievously / that the Pithonisse said / he
and his companion Acts. 16. 17.
were the servant of the high God / which preached unto them the way of
salvation. Here was truth / and yet rejected / and I would know whether
master Doctor would say that these spoke by the spirit of God. Thus whilst
without all judgment he snatcheth here a sentence / and there another out of
the Doctors / and that of the worste / as if a man should of purpose choose out
the dross / and leave the silver: within a while he will make no great
difference / not only between the prophets and apostles / and profane writers
/ as Aristotle and Plato / but not between them / which speak not by the
conduite and leading of the holy ghost / but by the violent thrusting of the
wicked spirit.

The reply unto the next section in the. 82. and. 83. and. 84. page.
HEre master doctor would feign (as it seems) if he durst / interpreat
diligent preaching / and preaching in season / and out of scafon / to be
preaching once a monthe. But because he dare not say so directly / he
compasses it about / and first puts ye case of one preaching twice a day
verbally / and with small substance of matter / and of another preaching but once
in a monthe / and does it pithily and orderly and discretely / and concludes
that such a sermon once in a month / is nearer the mind of the Apostle / then
all those other sermons made twice every day: and yet the case is not so clear
/ as he makes it. For granting that those (which he calls verbal sermons)
have some goodness and edifying / it must be very simple and slender meat /
which is not better being given every day / then the best and daintiest meat
once only in a month. For with the one / a man may live although he be not
lyking / with the other he being once fed / is afterward famyshed. But how if
the case be put / that the monthly and long labored sermons (as they are
called) have as little and les good wholesome doctrine in them / then the
sermons which are preached every day. Assuredly for the most of those that go
so long with a Sermon / and which I know / and have heard: when they come to
bring it forth / bryngforthe oftentimes more wind and unprofitable matter /
then any good and timely fruit / or wholesome substanciall doctrine. And no
marvel / for therein the word of God is fulfilled / which declares that the
talents of Gods gifts and grace are increased by continual use and laying out
of Math. 25. 22. 23. etc.
them / and of the other side diminished / and in the end taken quite away /
when as they are suffered to lie so long rusting / and as it were dug in the
ground.

And here master Doctor takes occasion to utter his stomach against London
/ flinging of one side against the women / of the other side against the
ministers / whose dilygence because it makes master Doctors negligence more
to appear / as a darcke and duskishe color matched with that which is clear
and lightsome / he does go about to deface / with the untrue and flaunderous
surmise / of lose neglygent and unprofitable preaching. If there be some one
such or two in London / it is too great iniurye therefore to charge indefinitely
the company of the ministers of London. Besides that M. Doctor does not see /
how first he accuses the bishop or ever he be aware / both in ordaining
such ministers / and not in reforming them / being so far out of order / and
then the archbishop / which does not require this disorder at the bishops hand
/ since as (he says) this is so goodly and heavenly an order / to have one
bishop over many ministers / and one archbishop over diverse bishops. And if we
shall esteem the pithynes and fastnes of preaching / by the fruits / as by
the knowledge and fear of God in the people of London / and by faithful and
true hearts toward the prince and the realm: I think that that which he
terms frivolous / lose / and unprofitable preaching will fall out to be
waightier / and to leave a deeper printe behind them / then those monthly
sermons which he speaks of: and the ministers of London better ministers
which preach twice a day / then those which make the word of God novel and
dainties / and as M. Latimer pleasantly said / strawberies coming only at
certain times in the year.

Of this thing M. Doctor speaks again in the. 167. page / but to this effect
altogether / and almost in the same words. To the next section being the rest
of the. 84. page / I mind to say nothing / having before spoken of the faults
of the ceremonies and rites which are used with us.

The reply unto the next section contained in. 86. 87. and. 88. pages.
AFter a number of words without matter / sayings without proufes /
accusations without any grounds or likelyhode of grounds / as that they be
instruments of greedy guts and lustye roysters / to maintain them in their
iolitye / which notwythstanding speak against patronages / and would have
the lyuings of the church / which are idly and unprofitably spent (for the
most part) applied to the right uses of the pore / and of ministers and
scholars / and that they would be discharged from eyuill and ecclesiastical
subjection / which humbly submitting them selves to the Queens majesty and all
those that are sent of her / would deliver the churches and them selves for the
churches sake / from the unlawful domynion of one / to the end that they
might yield them selves with their churches subject to the lawful
ecclesiastical government of those which God has appointed in his word:
After I say a number of such and like accusations mixed with most bitter and
reproachful words unto all which / it is suffitient answer / that quod Verbo
dictum est, Verbo sit negatum. As easily denied as said. He turns him self
to those that be in authority / whom he would make believe that it stands
upon the overthrow of the church / of relygion / of order / of the realm / and
of the estate of Princes and magistrates / which are by this means established
/ and whose estates are made this way most sure / when as y^ true causes of
these clamoures and outcryes that M. Doctor makes / is nothing else but the
fear of the overthrow of that honor / which is to the dishonor of God and
ignominy of his church / and the establishing of that which makes to the good
dispensing of those goods for the aid and help of the church / which now
serve to oppress it. As for the court of faculties / the corruptions thereof
being so clear / that all men see them / and so gross / that they which can
not see may grope them: M. Doctor answeareth / that he knows not what it
means / and therefore is moved of modesty to think the best of it / which is
but a simple shift. For besides that the Admonition speaks nothing of it /
but that the streates and high ways talk of: if there had been any defense
for it / it is not to be thought that M. Doctor would have been so neglygent an
advocate / as to have omitted it / seeing if he were ignorant / he might have
had so easily and with so little cost the knowledge of it. As for his
modesty / his bold asseueration of things which are doubtful / which are
false / which are altogether unlikely / which are impossible for him to know /
does suffyciently bewray and make so well known / that no such visard or
painting can serve to make men believe / that mere modesty shut up his mouth
from speaking for the court of faculties / which has opened his mouth so wide
for the defense of those things / wherein (as it falls out) he has declared
himself to have less skill and understanding / then he has of that court.

The reply unto the next section in the. 89. 90. 91. 92. 93. pages.
WHereas unto the Admonition proving out of the third of S. Matthew / that
preaching must go before the mynistring of the sacraments / you answer
first / that it is against all Logic to conclude a general rule upon a
particulare example: you shall understand that that which John did in that
point / he did it not as a singular person or as the son of acharie / but as
the mynister of the gospel / and therefore it appertains as well to all
other mynisters as unto him. For as it is a good conclusion / that for so much
as Peter in that he is a man / is borne to have / and by common course of
nature has two legs / therefore John and Thomas and all the rest have so:
even so for so much as John by reason of his ministry had need first to
preach / then to baptize / it follows / that all others that have that
ministry committed unto them must do the like. Secondarely you say / that it
does not appear that he preached immediately before he baptized them with
water. And yet S. Matthew after that he had showed that he preached repentance
(which the other Evangelists call the baptism of repentance) he adds that
then the people were baptized of him / which also may appear in the Acts /
where S. Paul notes this order to have been Act. 19. 5.
kept. For although between the story of his preaching and that which is said
of his baptising / there is interlaced a description of his diet and of his
apparel / yet these words (then came unto him. etc.) must needs be referred
unto the time which followed his preaching. And where as you say / that it is
manifest that our savior Christ was baptized without preaching: I would know
of you what one word does declare that / when as the contrary rather does
appear in S. Luke / which seems to note plainly that our savior Christ was
baptized / 3. Luke 21.
when the people were baptized. But the people (as I have showed) were baptized
immediately after they heard John preach / therefore it is like / that our
savior Christ was baptized / after that he had heard John preach. And it is
very probable / that our savior Christ which did honor the mynistery of God
by the hand of men so far / as he would voutchsafe to be baptized of John /
would not neglect or pass by his mynistery of the word / being more precious
then that of the sacrament / as it appears by John that our savior Christ
was present 1. John. 26.
at his sermons / for so much as S. John does as he was preaching to the people
point him out with the finger / and told them that he was in the midst of
them which was greater then he. And there is no doubt / but those words which
our savior Christ said before his supper / although they are gathered by the
Evangelists into short sentences / were notwithstanding long sermons /
touching the fruit of his death and use and end of that sacrament. And this
order of Acts. 2. Act. 8. 12. 38. Act. 9. 17. 18. Act. 10. 34. Act. 16. 15.
33. Act. 20. 7.
preaching immedyatly before the mynistring of the sacraments / is continually
noted of S. Luke throughout the whole story of the Acts of the Apostles. But I
will not precisely say neither yet do the authors of the Admonition affirm
(as M. Doctor surmyseth of them) that there must be preaching immediately before
the admynistration of the sacraments. This I say / that when as the life of
the sacraments depends of the preaching of the word of God / there must of
necessity the word of God be / not red but preached unto the people /
amongste whom the sacraments are mynistred. And forasmuch as I have proved
before / that no man may mynister the sacraments but he which is able to
preach the word / although I dare not affirm / that there is an absolute
necessity / that the word should be preached immediately before the sacraments
be mynistred / yet I can imagine no case / wherein it is either meet or
convenient or else almost sufferable / that the sacraments should be mynistred
without a sermon before them / for the mynister being as he ought of
necessity to be / able to preach / ought so to do. And if it be said that
his health or voice will not serve him sometimes to preach / when he is able
enough to mynister the sacraments: I say that either he ought to beg the
help of an other mynister hard by / or else there is less inconvenience in
deferring the celebration of the sacrament until he be strong enough to
preach / then ministering it so maymedly and without a sermon / whereby it is
seen / how just cause M. Doctor has to call these blind and unlearned
gatherings / which he with his Egles eye and his great learning can not scatter
/ nor once move.

After this M. Doctor accuses the authors of the Admonition / as though they
simply condemned reading the scriptures in the church / and this accusation he
follows in many words and in dyners places / wherein as in a number of other
places of their book the authors of the Admonition have cause to renew that
old complaynt of Theodorus / which is / that whenever any thing is said
that is unpleasant / that is by and by expounded otherwise then it is meant of
him that speaks it: so that that which is given with the right hand / is
received with the left. For the authors of the Admonition declaring their utter
mislyking that there should be in stead of a preaching minister a reading
mynister (if I may so call him) and in stead of preaching / reading / are
untruly expounded of M. doctor / as though they condemned all reading in the
church. And here he makes him self work / and picketh a quarrel to blot a
great deal of paper / and to prove that which no man denies / for besides
this treatise he speaks afterward of it in half a score pages / even from
the. 159. page until the. 1^0. page / and so lights us a candel at noone
days. It is a token of a nature disposed to no great quietness / which rather
then he would not strive / strives with him self. And although the cause be
just and good which he defends / yet I will note in a word or two / how as
though there were pitch or some worse thing in his hands / he defyleth
whatsoever he touches. First therefore he asks / and so / that he does most
boldly and confidently affirm it / whether the word of God is not as effectual
when it is red / as when it is preached / or whether reading be not preaching.
In which two questions / although the one of them confuteth the other (for so
much as if reading be preaching (as he says) then the comparyson of the
profit and efficacy between one and the other / is absurd) yet I will answer
to both. I say therefore that the word of God is not so effectual red as
preached. For S. Paul says / that faith comes by hearing / and hearing of
the word preached / 10. Romans 14.
so that the ordinary and especial means to work faith by / is preaching and
not reading. And although reading do help to nourish the faith which comes
by preaching / yet this is given to the preaching cath exochen, that is by
excellency / and for that it is the excellentest and most ordinary means / to
work by / in ye hearts of the hearers. The beholding of the creatures / and
the consideration of the making of the world and of Gods wisdom / and
wonderful love appearing in them / does nourish and strengthen faith / and yet
may it not therefore in efficacy be compared to the preaching of the word of
God. And to know that the word of God preached / has more force and is more
effectual then when it is red / it is to be observed whereunto the preaching
is compared. It is called a lifting or heauing up of our savior Christ. Like
unto the displaying of a banner / as the serpent John. 3. 14.
was lift up in the wilderness. As therefore that which is lyfted up on high /
is better and easelyer seen of a great company / then when it stands or
lies upon the ground or in some valley or low place: so the preaching of the
gospel does offer sooner and easlyer the truth thereof unto the faith (which
is the eye of the hearer) then when it is red. The same also may be said in
that the preaching 2. Tim. 2. 15.
is called a cutting of the word of God / for as when the meat is cut and
shred / it nourishes more then when it is not so / so likewise it is in
preaching and reading. And that which is brought by the authors of the
Admonition / and so scornefully hurled away of Master Doctor / that S. Paul
compares 1. Cor. 3. 6.
the preaching unto planting and watering / is a very notable place to prove
that there is no salvation / without preaching. For as the husbandman receives
no fruit / unless he both plant and water that which is planted: even so there
is no salvation to be looked for / where there is no preaching. And to this
also may be well referred that the preaching is called of Saint Luke an
opening of the scriptures 24. Chap. 32.
whereby it is declared / that they be as it were shut / or clasped / or
sealed up until such time as they be by exposition and declaration of them
opened. It may be that God does sometimes work faith by reading only /
especially where preaching cannot be / and so he does sometimes without
reading by a wonderful work of his spirit: but the ordinary ways whereby
God regenerateth his children / is by the word of God / which is preached. And
therefore Solomon Prou. 29. 18.
says / that where Prophecy (which is not a bare readyng / but an
exposition and applycation of the scriptures) fails / there the people
pearyshe. It is true / the word both preached and red / is all one / as the
fire covered with ashes / is the same when it is discovered. But ^s when the
fire is styrred up and discovered / it gives more heat then when it is not:
so the word of God by preaching and interpreating (as it were styrred up and
blown) makes a greater flame in the hearts of the hearers / then when it is
red. The reason whereof is not in the word / which is al one red and preached /
but in y^ ^^ pleases the Lord to work more effectually with the one / then
with the other / thereby approving and authorysing that means and ways /
which he especially ordained for us to be saved by.

Of infinite examples take one of the Enuche / which although he had been
Acts. 8.
at Jerusalem / and returning home / was reading of the Prophet Esaias / yet he
believed not / until Phillip came and preached unto him / which I neither say
to disalow reading of the scripture (which is very profitable) nor yet to
strengthen the hands of the papists / which to banyshe the reading of the
scriptures / object the hardness and difficulty of the scriptures / as M.
Doctor does most slanderously and unbrotherly surmise of the authors of the
Admonition: but that it may appear / what a gross and a palpable error this is
/ that the reading of the scripture should be as effectual as the preaching of
it / which God has appointed to be the especial and singular means to save
those / whom he has appointed to salvation. And what is this else but to
condemn the wisdom of God in ordeyning pastors and doctors to be contynuall
functions in the churches: and in so carefully commending them unto the church
of the which notwithstanding there is no use / if reading be as good as
preaching. And although this be very gross / yet in the. 163. page where he
goes about to show the profit of reading the scriptures in the church / he is
yet more absurd. For there he says / that it may be / that some men be more
edifyed by the simple reading of the scriptures / then by sermons. In deed if
a man sleep the sermon time / and wake the reading time / or be otherwise
deaf at the one and attentife and heedye at the other / I will not deny / but
he may be more edifyed at the simple reading / then at the sermon / unless it
be in this and such like case / I know not how it may be tute that M. Doctor
says. And in deed it is as much to say that it may be / that the means that
God has ordained to be the fittest and meetest to call men to salvation / is
not the fittest and meetest means / which a man should not once so much as
think of / without trembling and shaking every ioynte of him. And now I think
by this time M. Doctor knows his answer to his second question / which is
whether reading / be not preaching. And if this be not sufficient that I have
said / I would ask gladly of him / whether all readers be preachers / and
whether whosoever reads / preaches: for if it be true (which he says) that
reading is preaching / then that is likewise true / that all those which read
preach / and so a child of 4. or 5. years old / is able to preach / because
he is able to read. And least he should seem to be thus evil advised
without some reason / in the. 159. page he asks whether (if a man write his
sermon / and after read it in the book) that readyng be preaching. Here is
hard shift. What if I granted that it is preaching / yet I deny that therefore
he that reads an other man's sermon preaches: and further I say / that if
there be any such / as being able to preach for his knowledge / yet for fault
either of utterance or memory can not do it but by readyng / that which he has
written: it is not conuenyent / that he should be a mynister in the church. For
S. Paul does not require only that the bishop or minister 1. Tim. 3. 2.
should be learned in the mysteries of the gospel / and such a one as is able
to set down in writing in his study the sense of the scripture / but one which
is apt and fit to teach. And the Prophet Malachie shows / that he must have
the Malach. 2. 7.
law not in his papers / but in his lips / noting thereby / that it is
necessary to have the gift of vtteraunce / and Esaias the Prophet saying that God
had given Esaias. 50. 4.
him the tongue of the learned / does thereby declare / that it is not
suffycient that he be well instructed in the mystery of salvation / but that he
have also the gift of utterance. Afterward M. Doctor asks whether S. Paul
did not preach to the Romans when he wrote unto them. No forsooth his
writing to the Romans was no more preaching / then S. Paul's hand or his
pen / which were his instruments to write with / were his tongue / or his
lyghtes / or any other parts / which were his instruments to speak with. And
S. Paul him self Romans 1. 15.
writing to the Romans / puts a difference between his writing and his
preaching / when although he wrote unto them / yet he excuses him self that
he could not come to preach unto them / saying that he was ready as much as lay
in him to preach unto them. But says he / was not the reading of Deuteronomie
preaching? No more then the reading of Erodus. Here be good proufes. It is
generally denied / that reading is preaching / and Master Doctoure without any
proof / takes it for granted / that the reading of Deuteronomie is
preaching. All men see / how pityfull reasons these be. And in the. 162. page
he alleges that in the Acts S. Luke seems to mean by reading preaching.
But what dealing Cap. 15. 21.
is this / upon a seeming and conjecture / to set down so certainly and
undoubtedly / that reading is preaching / and then there is no one letter nor
syllable that vpholdeth any such conjecture. For S. James says that Moses
(meaning the law) red every Saboth through out every town in the sinagogue /
was also preached / or had those that preached it / setting forth the order
which was used in all the churches amongst the people of God: that always when
they met upon the Saboth days / they had the scriptures first read / and then
preached of and expounded / which is that the authors of the Admonition do
desire / and therefore complain for that after reading follows no preaching
/ which any indifferent man may easily understand by that that they say: In the
old time the word was preached / now it is supposed to be sufficient if it be
red.

But Master Doctor hears with his left ear / and reads with his left eye
/ as though his right eye were pulled out / or his right care cut of. For
otherwise the other words which they have touching this matter / might easily
have been expounded by the argument and matter which they handle. Of mynistring
of the sacraments in private places and by women / I have spoken before /
there remains therefore only in this section / to speak of the deacons /
that they ought not to minister the sacrament. Which although I have done
partly before / and partly afterward will do / when I shall show that it
appertains not to them to minister the word / and therefore not the
sacraments (being things the mynistery whereof ought not to be severed) yet I
will in a word answer those arguments that M. Doctor brings for to prove
that they may mynister the sacraments. Whereof the first is / that Phillip in
the. 8. of the Acts baptized. There is great doubt amongst writers / which
Phillip that was that S. Luke mentions in Acts. 15. 21.
the eight chapter of the Acts of the Apostles: But I grant him to be y^
Phillip / that was the deacon and answer that he was no deacon then. For the
church of Jerusalem whereof he was deacon / being scattered / he could be no
more deacon of it / or distribute the money that was collected for the poor of
the church. And further I answer that he was afterward an Evangelist / and
therefore preached not by virtue of his deaconshyppe (whose calling is not to
preach) but by that he was an Evangelist / whose office put upon him a
necessity of preaching. After you say that deacons are not permitted with us
to celebrate the Lords supper / and why then should they be suffered to
mynister baptism? as if the one sacrament were not as precious as the other.
This is a miserable rending a sonder of those things / which God has joined
together / not only to separate the mynistery of the sacraments from the word
/ but also the mynistery of one sacrament from an other.

And what reason is there / that it should be granted unto one that can not
preach being (as they call him a mynister) to mynister both the sacraments /
when as the same is not permitted unto a deacon (as they call him) which is
able to preach? I do not speak it for that I would have those which be
deacons in deed / that is which have charge to provide for the poor of some
one congregation / either preach or mynister the sacraments: but I say that it
is against all reason / to permit the mynistery of the sacraments to those
which can not preach / and to deny it to those which are able to preach. In
the. 118. page unto the example of Phillip / he adds S. Stephen / which was
one of ye deacons which he affirms to have preached. But I deny it / for all
that long oration which he has in the 7. of the Acts / is no sermon / but a
defense of him self against those accusations / which were laid against him /
as M. Beza does very learnedly and substancially prove in his annotations upon
those places of S. Stephens disputations and defense. Now to defend him self
being accused / is lawful not for the deacons only / but for any other
christian / and we read nothing that Stephen did there either touching the
defense of his cause / or the sharp rebuking of the obstinate phariseys and
priests / but that the holy Martyrs of God which were no deacons nor mynisters
/ have done with us / when they have been conuented before their persecutors.
And where as he says that Philip baptized / I have showed before by what
authority he did it / that is / not in that he was a deacon / but for that he
was an Evangelist. He adds further out of Justin Martyr / that the deacons
did distribute the bread and the wine in the admynistration of the supper.
Tullie says in a certain place that it is as great a point of wisdom in an
advocate or pleader of causes / to hold back and to keep close that which is
hurtful to his cause / as it is to speak that which is profitable.

M. Doctor observes none of these points / for besides that the things which
he brought for the defense of the service book / are such / as they have
before appeared: in seeking to defend it / he manyfestly oppugneth it. For
before he said that the book of service does not permit deacons to mynister
the supper of the Lord / and that by way of alowing of the book: and here he
proves that the deacons did mynister the sacrament of the supper / and that
also as a thing which he does allow of.

But to let that pass / I beseech thee (good Reader) mark / what a mynistring
of the supper this is which Justin makes mention of / and note with what
conscience M. Doctor handeleth this cause. Justin says that after the
scriptures are red and preached of / and prayers made / bread and wine and
water was brought forth / and that the mynister made prayers and thanks giving
in the hearing of the people (which is that which the Evangelists call the
blessing / and has been of later times called the consecration) and after that
the people were partakers of them / that then this being done / the deacons did
carry of that which was left / unto those which were not present (for that
corruption of sending the communion unto the houses was then in the church /
against which I have before spoken) now if to carry to a private house the
bread and wine which was blessed or set a part by prayers / and by obeying the
institution of Christ by the mynister / be to mynister the sacrament of the
supper / then Serapions boy / of whom mention is made by Eusebius / mynistred
the sacrament. For Serapion being sick as I have before showed / and sending
his boy to the mynister for the sacrament / received the same at the hands of
his boy / for that the mynister being sick / could not come him self: so by
M. Doctors reason / Serapions boy mynistred Lib. 6. l. 43.
the sacrament. And a man would not think that one that has been the Queen's
Majesty's public professor of divinity in Cambridge / should not know to
distinguish and put a difference between mynistring the sacrament / and helping
to distribute the bread and the cup of the sacrament. And if M. Doctor could
not learn this in books / yet he might have either seen it / or at least heard
tell of it in all the reformed churches almost / where the Deacons do assist
the mynister in helping of him to distribute the cup / and in some places
also the bread / for the quicker and spedyer dispatch of the people / being so
many in number / that if they should all receive the bread and the cup at the
mynisters hand / they should not make an end in eight hours / which by that
assistance may be finished in two / which is tha^ that M. Calvin says. For he
says the Deacons did reach the cup / and makes no mention of the bread. And
if this be to mynister the sacrament / then they that cut the loaf in pieces /
they that fetch the wine for the supper / they that pour it forth from greater
vessels into glasses and cups / or whosoever aydeth any thing in this action
/ do mynister the sacrament: then the which thing there can be nothing more
ridyculous.

In the end M. Doctor to shut up this matter / says / that it is the first
step to the mynistery / and so joined of S. Paul in the third chapter and
first Epistle to Timothe. But what a reason is this: to be a Deacon is the
first step to the mynistery / therefore the Deacon may preach and mynister the
sacraments / when as the contrary rather follows. For if it be a step to the
mynistery / then it is not the mynistery / but differs from it / and so ought
not to do the things that belong to the mynister. But I deny that it is / or
ought to be always a step to the mynistery. I knew that it has been the use
of long time / and I know also that there be very many which interpreate the
place of S. Paul / (where he speaking of the Deacons that behave them selves
well / that they get them selves a good bathmon, that is a degree to be a
mynister or a bishop.) But I will show a manifest reason / why it can not so be
understood / which is / for that as the functions of a Deacon or a mynister
are diverse: so are the gifts also whereby those functions are executed likewise
diverse. And therefore there may be some men for their wisdom and gravity /
discretion and faythfulnesse / and whatsoever other gifts are required in him
/ that should do this office of prouyding for the poor / and to be a good
Deacon: which notwithstanding for some impediment in his tongue / or for want
of utterance shall never be able as long as he lives / to be a good mynister
of the word / and therefore the gifts being diverse wherewith those offices
must be executed / (although it is neither unlawful / nor unmeet to make of a
Deacon a mynister if he have gifts for that purpose) yet I deny that S. Paul
appoynteth that the Deaconship should be (as it were) the seed or fry of the
mynisters: or that he means by those words that the Deaconship is a step to
the pastorshyp. Which may yet also further appear / by the phrase of speech
which the Apostle uses. For he does not say that they that do the office of
Deaconship well / shall come to or get a good standing / but he says that in
so doing they do get themselves a good standing / that is they get
themselves authority and estimation in the church / whereby they may be both
the bolder to do their office / and whereby they may do it with more fruit.
Whereas when they live naughtely / they neither dare do oftentimes that which
they should do / nor yet that which they do well / takes so good effect /
because of the discredit which comes by their evil behavior. And so I
conclude that M. Doctor has brought hitherto nothing / to prove why either
Deaco^s ought / or else have wont either to preach or to mynister the
sacraments.

And albeit M. Doctor be not able to show it / yet I confess that it has been
in times past permitted unto them in some churches to baptize / in other some
to preach and baptize and sometimes also to mynister the supper: but I say also
that this was a corruption / and used at those times / when there were many
other gross and intolerable abuses / from the which I do appeal unto that
which was first / that is the institution of the Apostles / which lymitted and
bounded every function within his several limits and borders which it ought
not to pass.

Unto the three next sections contained in the. 94. 95. and a piece of the. 96.
pages / touching that which is called the introite / and fragments of the
Epistles and Gospels / and the rehersall of the Nicene Creed / I have declared
before the causes of our mislyking / neither mean I to stand to refute the
slanderous surmises which M. D. rayseth of the authors of the Admonition /
whereby he would bring the^ into the suspision of Arrianisme / to whom all those
that fear God bear witness / y^ they are most far from. He him self
notwithstanding once again in the last of these three sections. 96. page / does
lay the manifest foundations of that part of Anabaptisme / which stands in
having al things common / saying directly against S. Peter / that in the time
of the Apostles / Christians had propriety 5. Acts. 4.
in nothing. And further giving great cause of triumph of the one side to the
Catabaptistes / and such as deny the baptism of young infants / in matching
that with those things which the church may (although not without incommoditie
yet without impiety) be without: and of the other side unto the papists /
whilst he says that we read not of any women which received the Lords supper
in the Apostles time. For this is that they allege to prove their unwritten
verityes / when as it is easily answered both to the papists and M. Doctor /
that for so much as the Apostle does witness / that the churches of Corinth
consysting of me^ and women did receive: that therefore women also did receive
/ and were pertakers of the Lords table. Thus it is manifest that M. Doctor
only to displease the authors of the Admonition / sticks not to pleasure iij.
notable heretics / Anabaptists / Catabaptists / and Papists.

To the next section contained in the. 96. and a piece of the. 97. page.
Master Doctor asks how it is proved that there was any examination of the
communicantes. After this sort: all things necessary were used in the
churches of God in ye Apostles times / but examynation of those whose knowledge
of the mystery of the gospel was not known or doubted of / was a necessary
thing / therefore it was used in the churches of God which were in the Apostles
time. Then he says he is sure there is neither commandment nor example in
all the scripture. In the book of the Chronicles he might have red / that 2.
Chro. 35. 6.
the Levites were there commanded to prepare the people unto the receiving of
the passover / in place whereof we have the Lords supper. Now examination
being a part of the preparation / it follows that here is commandment of
the examination. And how holds this argument / S. Paul commands that
every man should prove him self / Ergo there is no commandment that the
mynister should prove and examine them? so I may say that every man is a
spiritual king to govern him self / therefore he may not be governed of
others. The authors 1. Pet. 2. 9.
of the Admonition do not mean that every one should be examyned as those
whose understanding in the gospel is well known / or which do examyne them
selves / and so they interpreate them selves in the. 108. page.

To the next section in the 97. 98. and in a piece of the. 99. pages.
I Have spoken of this bread before in general / and if Master Doctor did not
disagree with him self / we are here well agreed. For first he says it
skilleth not what bread we have / and by and by he says / that he wysheth it
were common bread / and assigns a great cause which the book of service
likewise assigns / which is to avoid superstition. And it is certaynely
known by experience / that in diverse places the ignorant people y^ have been
mysled in popery / have knocked and kneeled unto it / and held up their hands
/ whilst the mynister has given it / not those only which have received it /
but those which have been in the church / and looked on. I speak of that
which I know / and have seen with my eyes. An other reason is alleged by
Master Bucer / which is / that there being some thicker substance of bread /
and such as should move and stir up the taste better / the consyderation of
the mind which is conveyed by the senses / might be also the more effectual /
and so the fruit of receiving greater. By the way note that either Bucers
censures upon the book of service be falsely ascribed unto him / or be
corrupted / or else were not even in his own time here thought good /
substantial / and suffycient / when there is some cause by Act of Parliament
afterward found (I mean in the second book of king Edward) to mislyke wafer
cakes / and to change them into common bread. How so ever it be / that
circumstance would be well marked / that it was one thing to talk of a wafer
cake in the use of the supper in king Edward days before they were justly
abolyshed / and an other thing now being revoked after they were removed.

Besides that / we be called by the example of our savior Christ to use in
the supper usual and common bread / for what time our savior Christ
celebrated his supper / there was no other bread to be gotten / but unleavened
bread / there being a straight charge given by the law / that there should be
then no leauened bread. And it is not to be doubted / but that if there had
been then when he celebrated his supper as at other times nothing but leauened
bread / he would not have caused unleavened bread to have been made for that
purpose of celebrating his supper. But this is a gross ouersyght of M. Doctor
/ both in this section / and that which goes before / that he has not
learned to make a difference between that which is not sincerely done / and
that which is not at all done. For in the former section he triumphs upon the
admonition / because they conclude / that for as much as there is no
examination / therefore it is not rightly and sincerely ministered. For says
he / the examination of the communicants / is not of the substance of the
sacrament / and in this section he says / that for as much as it is not of
the substance of the sacrament / whether there be leauened or unleavened bread
/ therefore it is not sufficiently proved / that the sacrament is not sincerely
ministered. But he ought to have understood / that if either the matter of the
sacrament as bread and wine / or the form of it / which is the institution
(which things are only substantial parts) were wanting / that then there
should have been no sacrament ministered at all / but they being retained / and
yet other things used / which are not convenient / the Sacrament is ministered /
but not sincerely. For example in the popish baptism / there was the
substance of baptism / but there being used spyttle and cream / and candels /
and such beggarly trumpery / it was not sincerely ministered / therefore it is
one thing to minister sincerely / and an other thing to minister / so that that
which is of the substance should be wanting. But of this distinction I have
spoken in an other place / wherinto although M. doctor falls in the next
section / and in other places / yet this shall be an answer for all.

The meaning of the Admonition in saying (their God of the altar) is plain
enough / that it is understood of the papists / but that M. Doctor does set
him self to draw the authors of it into hatred: and he can not be ignorant /
that when a man speaks of things which are notoriously known / he often
uses (the or that / or their) without naming the things which he speaks of.

To the next section contained in the. 99. and a piece of the. 100. page.
ALthough it be not of necessity / that we should receive the communion sitting
/ yet there is the same cause of abolishing kneeling / that there is of
removing the wafer cake / and if there be danger of superstition in one (as M.
Doctor confesses) why is there not danger in the other? And if there be men
that take occasion to fall at the one / and that by superstition / how comes
it to pass that M. Doctor in the. 180. page / says that neither gospeller /
nor papists obstinate nor simple / can superstitiously offend in this kneelyng
/ when as the kneeling caryeth a greater show of worship / and Imprinteth in
the minds of the ignorant a stronger opinion and a deeper print of adoration /
then the sight of a round ^ake. And if kneeling be so void of all fault / as
M. Doctor would make us believe / how came it to pass / that in King Edwardes
days / there was a protestation added in the book of prayer / to clear that
gesture from adoration.

An other reason why kneeling should be taken away / is for that sitting
agrees better with the action of the supper / whereunto M. Doctor takes
exception / both in this place / and where he speaks again of it / that for
so much as this sacrament is a sacrament of thanks giving / and thanks giving
a prayer / therefore kneeling to be most fit / as that which we use ordinarily
when we pray.

But he should have remembered / that that thanks giving may well come after we
have received the sacrament / and that whilst we receive the bread and wine of
ye sacrament / we are not then most fit to speak / they being in our mouths,
and during the time we receive them / our mind is occupied in consydering the
inestimable benefit which the Lord has bestowed upon us / and to meditate
of the fruit which we receive thereby / by the Analogy and comparison between
the bodily nourishment and the spiritual / that by these considerations our
minds may be more enflamed and set on fire / and our mouths may be filled
with the praise of God / after we have received. And further if this be a good
reason that therefore it is meet we should kneel at the supper for as much
as we give thanks / then it follows that when so ever we have supped or dined
/ it is meet that we should kneel / when as yet we do say grace sitting. And
by this he accuses our savior Christ and his Apostles / as those which did
not use ye which was most fit: for in his judgment he says kneeling is the
fittest site or position of the body which can be / and if our savior Christ
had been of that judgment / undoubtedly he would have also kneeled / and caused
his Apostles so to do. In the. 181. page unto the admonition / saying that
sitting is most fit / because it betokens rest and accomplishment of the
ceremonies in our savior Christ / M. doctor says it is a papisticall reason
/ and triumphs over the authors of the admonition / because they allegory /
when as notwythstanding the surplice before / crossing / and rings. etc.
afterward / are defended by nothing / but with vain allegories / which have
nothing so good grounds as this has. But let it be that this is not so sound a
reason (as in deed for my part I will not defend it / and the authors them
selves have corrected it) yet M. doctor might have dealt easlier with all /
then to callit a papisticall reason / which is far from popery / and the reason
of two notable learned and zealous men Johannes Alasco / and of M. Hooper in
his In liturgia eccles. per^gr.
commentary upon the Prophet Jonas. For the rest which he has here / or in
the. 180. and. 181. page / it is either answered before (as that the danger of
adoration may be taken away) or has no matter worthy the answearing. I only
admonish the reader / that sitting at the communion is not holde^ to be
necessary / but only that I think that kneling is very dangerous / for the
causes before aledged.

Unto the.iij. next sections contained in the.100. and.101. page / I have
spoken already / when as I showed the general faults of the service book /
only that is to be noted / that M. doctor still privily pincheth or ever he be
aware at our savior Christ's action / in the first of these sections / when as
he commends rather this form of speaking / take thou / then that which our
savior Christ used / in saying take ye. And if it be a good argument to prove
that therefore we must rather say take thou / then take ye / because the
sacrament is an application of the benefits of Christ: then for as much as
preaching is the applying of the benefits of Christ / it behooves that the
preacher should direct his admonitions particularly one after an other / unto
all those which hear his sermon / which is a thing absurd. And therefore
besides that it is good to leave the popish form / in those things which we
may so conveniently do: it is best to come as near y^ manner of celebration of
the supper / which our sauyor Christ used / as may be.

To the next section contained in the. 102. page.
When as many receive they know not what / some other without any examination
either of them selves or by others / how they come / with what faith in Christ
/ with what love toward their brethren / I see not against what rule of our
savior Christ it is / or what rash judgment to say that they come rather
of custom then of conscience / when neither they speak generally of all / nor
singularly of any one particulare person.

To the next section contained in the. 102. and a piece of the. 103. page.
IF the place of the. 5. to the Corinths do forbid that we should have any
familiarity with notorious offenders / it does much more forbid that they
should be received to the communion. And therefore papists being such / as which
are notoriously known to hold heretical opinions / ought not to be admitted /
much les compelled to the supper. For seeing that our savior Christ did
institute his supper amongst his disciples / and those only which were as S.
Paul speaks within / it is evident / that the papists being without / and
foreiners and strangers from the church of God / ought not to be received / if
they would offer them selves: and that minister that shall give the supper of
the Lord to him which is known to be a papist / and which has never made any
clear renouncing of popery with which he has been defiled / does profane the
table of the Lord / and does give the meat that is prepared for the children /
to dogs / and he brings into the pasture which is provided for the sheep /
swine and unclean beasts / contrary to the faith and trust that ought to be in
a steward of the Lords house / as he is. For albeit that I doubt not / but
many of those which are now papists / pertain to the election of God / which
God also in his good time will call to the knowledge of his truth: yet
notwythstanding they ought to be unto the minister and unto the church touching
the ministering of the sacraments / as strangers and as unclean beasts. And
as for the papists / howsoever they receive it / whether as their popish
breaden God (as some do) or as common and ordinary bread (as other some do) or
as a thing they know not what (as some other) they do nothing else but eat and
drink their own condemnation / the weight whereof they shall one day assuredly
feel / unless they do repeat them of such horrible profaning of the Lords most
holy mysteries. And if this be to gratify the papists / to show that they
ought not to be compelled to receive the supper of the Lord / as long as they
continue in their popery: I am well content to show them this. pleasure / so
that both they and you forget not / what I have before said / that the
magistrate ought to compel them to hear the word of God / and if they
profit not / nor with sufficient teaching correct not them selves / that then
they should be punyshed. And if you do ask why they should be more
compelled unto the sermons / then unto the supper of the Lord / or why they
are not as well to be admitted unto the one / as unto the other: you see the
like done in the sacrament of baptism / which may not be ministered unto all to
whom the word may be preached. The reason also is at hand / for the preaching
of the word of God to the papists / is an offer of the grace of God / which
may be made to those which are strangers from God / but the ministering of the
holy sacraments unto them / is a declaration and seal of Gods favor and
reconciliation with them / and a plain preaching / partly that they be washed
already from their sins / partly that they are of the household of God / and
such as the Lord will feed to eternail life / which is not lawful to be don to
those which are not of the household of faith. And therefore. I conclude / that
the compelling of papists unto the communion / and the dismissing and letting
of them go / when as they be to be punyshed for their stubbernes in popery
(with this condition if they will receive the communion) is very unlawful /
when as although they would receive it / yet they ought to be kept back / until
such time / as by their religious and gospellike behauior / they have purged
themselves of that suspicion of popery / which their former life and
conversation has caused to be conceived. As for the fee that M. doctor says
we be worthy of / for showing our selves (as he says) so good patrones of the
papists / he has given us well to understand / what it should be if he were
the paymaister: but as we serve the Lord in this work / so we look for reward
at his hand / not fearing but that the Lord will in the end give such
blessing unto our labors / as we shall not need greatly to fear at the hands
of those which God has placed in authority / thereward which you do so often
call for.

Unto that which is contained in the two next sections in the. 103. and a piece
of the. 104. pages I have answered before partly particularly: and partly when
I noted the general faults of the service book / especially seeing that M.
Doctor will not defend the piping / and organes / nor no other singing then is
used in the reformed churches: which is in the singing of two Psalms / one in
the beginning / and an other in the ending / in a plain tune / easy both to
be sung of those which have no art in singing / and understood of those
which because they can not read / can not sing with the rest of the church.

The reply unto the next section which is contained in the 106. 107. and a
piece of the. 108. pages.
FOr that which is in the. 105. page / and concerns the surplice / I have
answered before. There follows the interrogatories or demaundes ministered
unto the infants in baptism / for the proof whereof is brought / in the first
place Dionisius Areopagita, a worthy cover for such a cup. For to let pas /
that M. doctor alleges the celestial hierarchy / in stead that he should
have cited the ecclesiastical hierarchy / this testimony being found in the
one / and not in the other: dare M. Doctor be so bold / as to delude the world
in so great light / with such bables as this? does he think that the author
of these books of hierarchies / being so full of subtle speculations / vain
and idle fancies / wicked blasphemies / making one order of popes / an other of
prelates / the third of sacrificers / and then of monks (some of which orders
came not many hundredth years after that time / wherein Denis the Arcopagite
lived) which mentions many folish ceremonies and corruptions (that no other
author neither Greek nor Latin stories / nor others diverse hundredth years
after does make any mention of besides him) I say does he think to abuse men
/ and to give them such dross in stead of silver / such chafe in stead of
corn / as to make us believe that he that wrote these books of hierarchy / was
s. Paul's scholar? for the better blasing of this Denis arms / I will send the
(reader) unto that which Erasmus writes of this Denis of M. Doctors / upon
the. 17. of the Acts of the Apostles / where he also shows together with his
own judgment / the judgment of Laurentius Valla. I am 1. Lib. 20. cap.
not ignorant what Nicephorus a fabulous historiographer / and of no credit in
such matters (and in those matters especially / which might like or mislike
those times wherein he wrote) says of S. Paul's communicating with Denis / and
another / concerning the heavenly and Ecclesiastical hierarchy. But because I
think M. Doctor be now ashamed of his Denis / I will follow it no further.

By this it may appear / that M. Doctors Dionisius being a counterfeit and
startvp / these interrogatories and demau^ds ministered unto the infants / have
not so many gray hairs as he would make us believe / although in deed the
question lies not in ye antiquity. As for reasons he has none / but only as
one which has learned his aequipollences very evil / he makes it all one to
say (I renounce) and to say (I will teach an other to renounce.) As for S.
Augustines place (although I can not allow his reason that he makes / nor the
proportion that is between the sacrament of the body and blood of our savior
Christ / and his body and blood it self of one side / and between the
sacrament of baptism / and faith of the other side: saying that as the
sacrament of the body of Christ after a sort is the body / so the baptism of
the sacrament of faith / is after a sort faith / whereas he should have said /
that as the supper being the sacrament of y^ body of Christ / is after a sort
the body of Christ: so baptism being a sacrament of the blood of Christ / is
after a sort the blood of Christ / for faith is not the subject of baptism /
as the body and blood of Christ is the matter of the supper). Yet I say that S.
Augustine has no one word to approve this abuse of answearing in the childs
name / and in his person / but goes about to establish an other abuse / which
was / that it was lawful for those that presented the child / to say that it
believed. So that it is like that the minyster did ask those which presented
the infant / whether they thought that it was faithful / and did believe / and
those which presented it / said it was so: whereupon this question rose /
whether it was lawful to say that the child believed.

In the. 191. and. 192. pages / he speaks of this again / but he does
nothing else but repeat in both places / that which is here / only he says /
that it is a mocking of God to use the place of the Galathians (God is not
mocked) against Galath. ^. 7.
this abuse / and his reason is / because s. Paul speaks there against those
that by fained excuses / seek to defraud the pastor of his living / as who
should say s. Paul did not conclude that particulare conclusion (thou shall
not by frivolous excuses defraud the minister) with this general saying (God is
not mocked) for his reason is / God is not mocked at all / or in any matter /
therefore he is not mocked in this. Or as who should say / because our savior
Christ saying that it is not lawful to separate that which God has joined /
speaking of divorce: it is not lawful to use this sentence / being a general
rule / in other things / when as we Math. 19. 6.
know it is as well and properly used against the papists / which sever the cup
from the bread / as against the Jews which put away their wives for every
small and trifeling cause. And as for this questioning / it can be little
better termed / then a very trifeling and toying. For first of all / children
have not / nor can not have any faith / having no understanding of the word of
God / I will not deny / but children have the spirit of God / which works in
them after a wonderful fashion. But I deny that they can have faith which
comes by hearing / and understanding which is not in them. Secondarily / if
children could have faith / yet they that present the child / can not
precisely tell / whether that particulare child has faith or no / and
therefore can not so absolutely answer that it believes? Because it is
comprehended in the covenant / and is the child of faithful parents / or at
the least of one of the parents / there is warrant unto the presenters to offer
it unto baptism / and to the minister for to baptize it. And further we have
to think charitably / and to hope / that it is one of the church. But it can
be no more precisely said that it has faith / the^ it may be said precisely
elected (for in deed it is all one to say that it is elect / and to say it
believes) and this I think the authors of the admonition do mean / when they
say that they require a promise of the Godfather / which is not in them to
perform. Thirdly / if both those things were true / that is / that infantes
had faith / and that it might be precisely said y^ it believes / yet ought not
the minister demand this of the child / whom he knows can not answer him /
nor those that answer for the child ought to demand to be baptized / when
they neither mean / nor may be (being already baptized. But it is meet / that
all things should be done gravely / simply / and plainly in the church. And so
(if those other two things were lawful) it ought to be done / as seems to
have been done in S. Augustines times / when the minister asked those that
presented the infant / and not the infant / whether it were faithful / and
those which presented / answered in their own persons / and not in the
childs / that it was faithful.

For Godfathers there is no controversy between the admonition / and M. doctors
book / which appears not only in their corrections / but plainly in the 188.
page / where they declare that they rather condemn the abuse / whylest it is
urged more then greater matters / and which are in deed necessary / this being
a thing arbitrarie / and left to the discretion of the church / and whilst
there is so evil choice for the most part of Godfathers / which is
expressedly mentioned of the admonition / and whilst it is used almost for
nothing else / but as a mean for one friend to gratify an other / without
having any regard to the solemn promise made before God and the congregation
/ of seeing the child brought up in the nurture and fear of the Lord. For
the thing it self / consydering that it is so generally received of all the
churches / they do not mislike of it.

As for fonts I have spoken of before / both particularly and in general. But
whereas M. doctor says in the apostles times they baptized in no basins but in
rivers and common waters / I would know whether there was a river or common
water in Cornelius and in the iaylors houses / where Paul and Peter baptized.

To prove crossing in baptism / M. Bucers authority is brought. I have said
before / what injury it is to leave the publyke works of Bucer / and to fly
unto the Apochryphas, wherein also they might drive us to use the like / and to
set down likewise his words which we find in his private letters. But it is
first of all to be observed of the reader / how and with what name those notes
are called / which are cited of M. Doctor for the defense of these corruptions.
They are called by M. Doctors own confession (censures) which word signifies
and implies / as much as corrections and controlments of the book of service
/ and therefore we may take this for a general rule throughout the whole book
of service / that in whatsoever things in controversy M. Doctor does not bring
Bucers authority to confirm them / that those things Bucer mislyked of: as for
example in private baptism / and communions ministered in houses / for
interrogatories ministered unto infants / and such like / for so much as they
are not confirmed here by M. Bucers judgment / it may be thought / that he
mislyked of them / and no doubt if either M. Bucers notes had not either
condemned or mislyked of diverse things in the service book: we should have had
the notes printed and set forth to the full / this I thought in a word to
admonish the reader of.

Unto M. Bucers authority / I could here opposemen of as great authority / yea
the authority of all the reformed churches / which shall also be done
afterward. And if there were nothing to oppose but the word of God / which
will have the sacraments ministered simply / and in that sincerity that they be
left unto us / it is enoughe to make all men to cover their faces / and to be
ashamed / if that which they shall speak / be not agreeable to that
simplicity. The reasons which Bucer brings I will answer / which in this
matter of crossing are two. First that it is ancient / and so it is in deed.
For Tertullian makes mention of this Lib. de resurrect. carnis.
usage / and if this be sufficient to prove the goodness of it / then there is
no cause why we should mislyke of the other superstitions and corruptious which
were likewise used in those tunes. For the same Tertullian shows / that they
used Lib. de corona militis.
also at baptism to taste of miike and honey / and not to wash all the week
after they had ministered baptism.

But here I will note the cause whereupon I suppose this use of crossing came
up in the primitive church / whereby shall appear / how there is no cause now
why it should be retained / if there were any why it should be used in the
primitive church. It is known to all that have red the Ecclesiastical stories
/ that the heathen did object to the Christians in times past in reproach /
that the God which they believed of / was hanged upon a cross. And they thought
good to testify that they were not ashamed therefore of the same God / by the
often using of the sign of the cross / which carefulnes and good mind to
keep amongst them an open profession of Christ crucified / although it be to
be commended: yet is not this means so: for they might otherwise have kept it
/ and with les danger / then by this use of crossing. And if they thought ye
use of the cross to be the best means / yet they should not have been so
bold / as to have brought it into the holy sacrament of baptism / and so
mingle the ceremonies and inventions of men / with the sacraments and
institution of God. And as it was brought in upon no good ground / so the Lord
left a mark of his curse of it / and whereby it might be perceived to come out
of the forge of man's brain / in that it began forthwyth / while it was yet
in the swaddling clouts to be superstitiously abused. For it appears by
Tertullian also in the same book De corona militis, that the christians had
such a superstition in it / that they would do nothing / nor take nothing in
hand / unless they had crossed them when they went out / when they came in /
when they sat or lay down / and when they rose / and as superstition is
always strengthened / and spreads it self with the time / so it came from
crossing of men / unto crossing of every thing that they used. Whereupon
Chrysostom comme^deth the crossing Upon the. 1. of Tim. 4. chap.
of the cup before a man drink / and of the meat before it was eaten. But if
it were granted that upon this consyderation which I have before mentioned /
the ancient christians did well: yet it follows not / that we should so do.
For we live not amongst those nations which do cast us in the teethe / or
reproach us with the cross of Christ. If we lived amongst the Turks / it
were another matter / and then there might peradventure some question be /
whether we should do as they did / and having the same sore / use the same
plaster: but now we live among the papists / that do not contemn the cross
of Christ / but which esteem more of the wodden cross / then of the true
cross of Christ (which is his sufferings) we ought now do clean contrariwise
to the old christians / and abolyshe all use of these crosses / for contrary
dyseases must have contrary remedies. If therefore the old christians to
deliver the cross of Christ from contempt / did often use the cross: the
christians now to take away the superstitious estimation of it / ought to take
away the use of it. Concerning the other reason of the profitable signification
of the cross / I have showed / that that makes the thing a great deal worse
/ and brings in a new word into the church / whereas there ought to be no
Doctor heard in the church / but only our savior Christ. For if these
significations be good / then the papists have to answer us / that their
ceremonies be not dumb / which have as lykely and as glorious significations
as these are / and so in deed they say / that their ceremonies are not dumb
ceremonies / for so much as they signify so good things. But although it be the
word of God that we should not be ashamed of the cross of Christ / yet is it
not the word of God / that we should be kept in remembrance and observation of
ye by two lines drawn a cross one over an other in the childs forehead / but
a fond toy and idle devise of man's brain.

In the. 192. page / unto the admonition obiecting that by this signification
it is made a sacrament / M. Doctor answeareth that every ceremony which
betokens some thing is not a sacrament: I would know what makes a sacrament
if a doctrine annexed unto an outward sign does not make a sacrament. And I
am sure / there was no outward sign neither in the old testament nor in the
new / which has a doctrine joined with it / which is not a sacrament. For if
he will take the nature of the sacrament so straightly as Augustine does / and
that there be no Sacraments / but when as to the clement there comes the
word / the circumcision can be no sacrament. Besides that / seeing that
master Doctor has condemned the allegory and signifycation of sytting at the
Lords supper / saying that it is Papisticall / I marvel what privilege he
has or special license / that he may allow that in him self and in his own
assertio^s / which he says is unlawful and papisticall in others /
especially seeing the allegorye of the sitting was never used by the Papists /
but this of crossing is. And if this license of allegories be allowed / I see
not why Oil may not be brought into the sacrament / as well as crossing /
both because it has been a sacrament of God before / and for that the
signification thereof (betokening the gifts of the holy ghost / and shadowing
out the power and efficacy of those gyfts) caryeth as great a show of wisdom
and christian instruction / as does the crossing. And to conclude / I see no
cause / why some crosses should be unlawful / and other some commendable: and
why it should be a monument of popery in wode and metal / and yet a
christistian badge in the forehead of a man: why we should not like of it in
streates and high ways / and yet allow of it in the church. And because I
would have all those things together / that touch this matter of baptism / I
come to that which he has in the next section / and in the. 111. page / where
after his old manner he wrangleth and quarelleth. For although the Admonition
speaks so plainly and so clearly / that (as Hesiode says) it might areskein
to momo satisfy Momus / yet M. doctor goes about there to bring it in
suspicion of Anabaptisme / because allowing in plain words / the baptism of
infants / they add that if the parties be of discretion and years / them
selves in their own parsons should demand to be baptized. For says he in
this church / they tarry not for baptism so long. But is there no case or may
there not be / when they that be of age may be baptized? It may be there are
Jews in England / which understanding their blindness / and confessing their
sin / may desire to be baptized / and there be diverse Mores in noble men's
and gentle men's houses / which are sometimes brought to the knowledge of
Christ / whereby there is some use and practice of this case.

After that M. Doctor has cast him self in derision / at the feet of the
authors of the Admonition / and desired to be taught of them whom he has so
contemptuously condemned as unlearned / he does by and by raise up him self
into his chair / and there sits Doctorally / apposing the authors of the
admonition / as if they were his scholars: and upon occasion of the sound
faith and good behauyor of the parents of the infant mentioned by the
admonition / asks first of all / what if the infant be the child of a
dronkard? what if he be of a harlot? shall not (says he) the infant be
baptized? If it were not that M. doctor in asking these questions does also
answer them / and answeareth them far otherwise then the truth does suffer
/ I would not be drawn from the causes which we have in hand by these roging
questions / now I can not leave them vnansweared / because I see that master
Doctor does make of the holy Sacrament of baptism (which is an entry into the
house of God / and whereby only the family of God must enter) a common passage
whereby he will have clean and unclean / holy and profane / as well those
that are without the covenant as those that be within it / to pass by: and so
makes the church no household / but an June to receive whosoever comes. I
will answer therefore almost in as many words / as the questions be asked. If
one of the parents be neither drunkarde nor adulterer / the child is holy by
virtue of the covenant / for one of the parents sakes. If they be both / and
yet not obstinate in their sin / whereby the church has not proceeded to
Excommunication / (them selves being yet of the church) their child can not /
nor ought not to be refused. To the second question / wherein he asks what if
the child be of Papists or Heretics. If both be Papists / or condenmed
heretics / (if so be I may distinguishe papists from heretics) and cut of
from the church / then their children can not be received / because they are
not in the covenant: if either of them be faithful / I have answered before
that they ought to be received. To the other question wherein he asks / what
if they err in some points of matters of faith. If it be but an error / and
be not in those points which case the foundations of faith / because they still
notwythstandyng their error / are to be counted amongst the faithful / their
children pertain unto the promise / and therefore to the sacrament of the
promise.

And in the. 193. page he asks / what if the parents of the child be
unknown. If they be / yet if godly men will present it to baptism / with
promise of seeing it brought up in the fear of the Lord / for so much as it
is found in a place where the church is / and therefore by lykelyhoode to
appertain unto some that was of the church: I think it may be baptized / if
the church think it good in this last case.

Then he goes forth in the. 111. page to prove that the children of those
which he has reckned / may be baptized / and demands whether a wicked
father may have a good child / a papist or heretic father a believing child?
yes verily may they. So may have and has the Turk and the Jew / and yet
their children are not to be received / unless their faith do first appear
by confession. But you say the papist and heretic be baptized / and so are
not the Jews and Turks. Their baptism (they being cut of from the church)
makes them as much strangers unto it / as was Ismael and Esau: which albeit
they were circumcysed / yet being cast out of the church / they were no more to
be accounted to be of the body of Gods people / then those which never were in
the church. Now you see the poison (as you term it) which lies hyd under
these words / and if it be as you say poison / let us have some of your
triacle. In all the rest of the section / there is nothing but that which he
spoke of before / only the eldershyp is named / which comes to be entreated
of in the next section.

The reply unto the three next sections concerning the senyors / beginning in
the latter end of the. 112. page / and holding on until the beginning of the.
118. page.
AS though M. Doctor were at utter defiance with all good order / and Method
of writing / that which was given him orderly by the Admonition / he has
turned vpsyde down. For where the Admonition speaks first of the elders /
then of that which is annexed unto them / which is the dyscipline (whereof
excommunication is a part) consydering that the subject is in nature before
that which is annexed unto it / M. Doctor has turned it clean contrary / and
first speaks of excommunication / and then of the elders. I will therefore
that the reader may the easelyer understand that which is said / follow the
order of the Admonition / and first of all speak of the elders or senyors
which ought to be in the church. And in speaking of them / I must call to
remembrance that division which I made mention on before / that is: Of those
which have care and which govern the whole congregation / some there be which
do both teach the word and govern also: some which do not teach / but only
govern / and be ayders in the government / unto those which do teach. This
dyuision is most manifestly set forth in the Epistle unto Timothe: where he
says the elders 1. Tim. 5. 17.
which rule well / are worthy of double honor / and especially those which
labor in the word and doctrine / where he makes by plain and express words
two sorts of elders / the one which does both govern and teach: the other
which governs only. These therefore are the senyors which are meant / whose
office is in helping the pastor or bishop / in the government of that
particulare church / where they be placed pastors and elders. Now that it is
known what these senyors be / in entreating of them I am content to answer M.
Doctor three requests which he makes in the. 125. page / where he desires
that one would do so much for him / as first to show that these senyors were in
every congregation: secondarely he will have it proved that this regiment is
perpetual / and not to be altered: last of all he desires to know / whether
these senyors were lay men / and not rather mynisters of the word and bishops.
This last is a fond request / and such as is already answered / but he must be
followed. For the first therefore / which is / that there were segnyors in
every congregation / although M. Doctor in the 114. page / and in the. 132.
page / constrained / by Ambose authority / confesses it in plain words /
yet because he requires it to be showed / and makes a jest at those places
which are alleged out of the scripture to prove it / some thing must be
spoken thereof. The first place is in the Acts / which is / that Paul and
Barnabas did appoynte by election / elders in every congregation / but it is
not like they did appoint diverse ministers or bishops / which preached in every
congregation / which were not to be had for such a number of congregations as
were Acts. 14. 23.
then to be preached unto: therefore in every congregation there were besides
those that preached / other elders which did only in government assist the
pastors which preached. And what should we follow comectures here / when S.
Paul does in the place before alleged declare / what these elders are. But M.
Doctor 1. Tim. 5. 17.
says that there is no mention made of the office of such an elder: therefore
that place makes nothing to prove that there should be such elders in every
congregation. So M. Doctor write / he cares not what he write. Belike he
thinks the credit of his degree of Doctorshyp / will give weight to that
which is light / and pithe to that which is froth / or else he would never
answer thus. For then I will if this be a good reason say / that for so much
as S. Luke does not in that Acts. 14. 17.
place describe the office of the pastor or bishop which preaches the word
/ therefore that place proves not that in every congregation there should be a
bishop or a pastor. Besides that / M. Doctor takes up the authors of the
Admonition for reasoning negatiuely of the testimony of all the scriptures /
and yet he reasons negatiuely of one only sentence in the scripture. For he
would conclude that for so much as there is no duty of a senyor described in
that place / therefore there is no duty at all / and consequently no senyor.

Afterward he says / that for so much as this place has been used to prove
a pastor or bishop in every church / therefore it can not be used to prove these
elders / so that (says he) there must needs be either a contradiction or
else a falsification. The place is rightly alleged for both the one and the
other / and yet neither contradiction to them selves / nor falsification of the
place: but only a must before M. Doctors eyes / which will not let him see a
plain and evident truth / which is / that the word (elder) is general / and
comprehends both those elders which teach and govern / and those which
govern only / as has been showed out of S. Paul. And whereas M. Doctor
says / that the place of the Corinthes 2. Cor. 12.
may be understood of cyuill magistrates / of preaching mynisters / of
gouernoures of the whole church / and not of every particulare church / and
finally any thing / rather then that whereof it is in deed understood: I say
first that he still stumbleth at one stone / which is / that he can not put a
difference between the church and common wealth: and so between the church
officers which he there speaks of / and the officers of the common wealth /
those which are ecclesiastical: and those which are cyuill. Then that he
means not the mynister which proacheth / it may appear / for that he had
noted them before in the word (teachers) and last of all he can not mean
gouernoure of the whole church / onles he should mean a Pope / and if he will
say he means an Archbishop which governs a whole province / besides that it
is a bold speech without all warrant / I have showed before that the word of
God allows of no such office / and therefore it remains that it must be
understood of this office of Elders. The same answer may be made unto that
which he says of the place to the Romans / where speaking of the offices of
the church / after that he had set forth Cap. 12.
the office of the pastor / and of the doctor / he adds those other two
offices of the Church / whereof one was occupied in the government only / the
other in prouyding for the poor / and helping the sick. And if besides the
manifest words of the Apostle in both these places / I should add the
sentences of the writers upon those places / as M. Calvin / M. Beza / M. Martyr
/ M. Bucer. etc. It should easily appear / what just cause M. Doctor has to
say / that it is to daily with the scriptures / and to make them a nose of wax
/ in alleging of these to prove the elders / that all men might understand /
what terrible outcryes he makes / as in this place / so almost in all other /
when there is cause / that he should lay his hand upon his mouth.

This I am compelled to write / not so much to prove that there were senyors in
every church (which is a thing confessed) as to redeame those places from M.
Doctors false and corrupt interpretations. And as for the proof of elders in
every congregation / besides his confession / I need have no more but his own
reason: For he says that the office of these elders in every church / was in
that time wherein there were no christian magistrates / and when there was
persecution / but in the Apostles times there was both persecution / and no
christian magistrates / therefore in their time the office of these elders was
in every congregation. I come therefore to the second point wherein the
question especially lies / which is / whether this function be perpetual /
and ought to remain always in the church. And it is to be observed by the
way / that where as there are diverse sorts of adversaries to this disciplyne
of the church / Master Doctor is amongst the worst. For there be that say /
that this order may be used or not used now / at the liberty of the churches:
But M. Doctor says that this order is not for these times / but only for
those times when there were no christian magistrates / and so does flatly pinch
at those churches which having christian magistrates / yet notwithstanding
retain this order still.

And to the end that the vanity of this distinction / which is / that there
ought to be senyors or auncientes in the times of persecution / and not of
peace: under tyrants and not under christian magistrates may appear: the
cause why these senyors or auncientes were appointed in the church / is to be
considered / which must needs be granted to be / for that the pastor not
being able to ouersee all him self / and to have his eyes in every corner of
the church / and places where the churches aboade / might be helped of the
auncientes. Wherein the wonderful love of God toward his church does
manifestly appear / that for the greater assurance of the salvation of his /
did not content him self to appoint one only ouerseer of every church / but
many over every church.

And therefore seeing that the pastor is now in the time of peace / and under a
christian magistrate not able to ouersee all him self / nor his eyes can not
be in every place of the paryshe present to behold the behavior of the
people / it follows that as well now as in the time of persecution / as well
under a christian prince as under a tyrant / the office of an ancient or
seignior is required. Onles you will say that God has less care of his church
in the time of peace and under a godly magistrate / then he has in the time of
persecution / and under a tyrant. In deed if so be the auncientes in the time
of persecution and under a tyrant / had meddled with any office of a magistrate
/ or had supplied the room of a godly magistrate / in handling of any of those
things which belonged unto him / then there had been some cause why a godly
magistrate being in the church / the office of the senior / or at least so much
as he exercised of the office of a magistrate / should have ceased.

But when as the ancient neither did / nor by any means might meddle with
those things which belonged unto a magistrate / no more under a tyrant the^
under a godly magistrate / there is no reason why the magistrate entering into
the church / the elder should be therefore thrust out. For the elders office was
to admonish severally / those that did amiss / to comfort those which he saw
weak and shaking / and to have need of comfort / to assist the pastor in
ecclesiastical censures of reprehensions / sharper or milder as the faults
required / also to assist in the suspe^sions from the supper of the Lord until
some trial were had of the repentance of that party which had confessed him
self to have offended / or else if he remained stubburne / to assist him in
the excommunication. These were those things / which the elders did / which
for so much as they may do as well under a christian magistrate / as under a
tyrant / as well in the time of peace as in the time of persecution / it
follows that as touching the office of elders / there is no distinction in
the times of peace and persecution / of a christian prince and of a tyrant. But
I will yet come nearer. That without the which / the principal offices of
charity can not be excercised / is necessary and always to be kept in the
church. But the office of ancients and elders are such as with out which the
principal offices of charity can not be exercised / therefore it follows that
this office is necessary. That the principal offices of charity can not be
exercised without this order of auncientes / it may appear for that he which
has faulted / and amendeth not after he be admonyshed once privately / and
then before one wytnes or two / can not further be proceeded against /
according to the commandment of our savior Christ / unless there be in the
church / ancients and elders / therefore this principal office of charity /
which tends to the amendment of him which has not profited by those two
former admonitions / can not be exercised without them. For it is commanded of
our savior Christ / that in such a case when a brother does not profit by
these Math. 18. 15.
two warnings / it should be told the church. Now I would ask who be meant by
the church here / if he say by the church are meant all the people / then I
will ask how a man can conveniently complain to all the whole congregation /
or how can the whole congregation conveniently meet to decide of this matter.
I do not deny / but the people have an interest in the excommunication / as
shall be noted hereafter / but the matter is not so far come / for he must
first refuse to obey the admonition of the church / or ever they can proceed
so far. Well / if it be not the people that be meant by the church / who is
it? I hear M. Doctor say it is the pastor / but if he will say so / and speak
so straungely / he must warrant it with some other places of scripture where
the church is taken for one / which is as much to say as one man is many / one
member is a body / one alone is a company. And besides this strangenes of
speech / it is clean contrary to the meaning of our savior Christ / and
destroys the soueraignitie of the medycine which our savior Christ prepared
for such a festered sore / as would neither be healed with private admonition /
neither with admonition before one or two witnesses. For as the fault grows /
so our savior Christ would have the number of those before whom he should
be checked and rebuked / likewise grow. Therefore from a private admonition he
ryseth unto the admonition before two or three / and from them to the church /
which if we should say it is but one / then to a daungerouser wound should be
laid an easier plaster: and therefore our savior does not rise from two to
one / (for that were not to rise but to fall / nor to proceed but to go
backward (but to many. Seeing then that the church here is neither the whole
congregation / nor the pastor alone / it follows that by the church here he
means the pastor / with the ancients or elders. Or else whom can he mean?
And as for this manner of speech / wherein by the church is understood the
chief governors and elders of the church / it is oftentimes used in the old
Testament / from the which our savior borrowed this manner of speaking / as in
Exodus it is said. That Moses wrought his miracles before the people / when
mention is 4. chap. 29. 30.
made before / only of the elders of the people / whom Moses had called
together. And most manifestly in * Iosue / where it is said / that he that
killed a man at 20. chap. 4. 6.
unawares / shall return unto the city until he stand before the
congregration to be judged. Where by the congregation / he means the
gouernoures of the congregation / for it did not appertain to all to judge of
this case. Likewise in the Chronicles / and diverse other places. And therefore
I conclude that for so much 1. li. 13. cap. 2. 4.
as those be necessary and perpetual which are spoken of in those words (tell
the Church) and that under those words are comprehended the elders or
auncientes / that the elders and auncientes be necessary and perpetual
officers in the church. Furthermore S. Paul having entreated throughout the
whole first Epistle to Timothe / of the orders which ought to be in the church
of God / and of ye government / as him self witnesses in ye third chapter of
that Epistle (when he says he wrote that Epistle to teach Timothe how he
should behave him self in the house of God) and having set forth both
bishop / and elder / and deacons / as mynisters and officers of the church /
in the shutting up of his Epistle he (for the observation of all the orders of
that Epistle) adiureth Timothe / and 1. Tim. 6. 13. 14.
with the invocation of the name of God strayghtly charge him / to observe
those things which he had prescribed in that Epistle. I charge thee (says
he) before God which quickens all things / and before Jesus Christ which
witnessed under Pontius Pilate a good profession that thou keep this
commandment without spot or blemishe / until the appearing of our Lord Jesus
Christ. The wayght of which sentence for the observing of those things which
are mentioned in this Epistle / that it may be the better understood / I will
note the words severally.

First therefore it is to be noted that he says (I denounce or I charge.) He
does not say (I exhort or give counsel) leaving it to the lyberty of Timothe.

Secondarely it is to be noted / that he calls the whole Epistle a
commandment / and therefore it is no permission / so that it may be lawful
for the churches to leave it / or to keep it.

Thirdly / when he makes mention of the living God / and of Christ / which
witnessed a good profession under Pontius Pilate / he shows that the things
contained in this Epistle are such / as for the mayntenaunce thereof we ought
not to doubt to give our lives / and that they be not such as we ought to keep
/ so that we have them without strife and without sweat / or easily / but such
as for the keeping of them if we have them / and for the obtaining of them if
we have them not (I will not say our honors / or our commodities and wealth /
but as I have said) our lives ought not to be dear unto us. For therefore does
he make mention of the confession of Christ unto the death / that he might
show us an example / and forthwith speaks of God / which rayseth from the
dead / that by this means he might comfort Timothe if he should be brought
into any trouble for the defense of any of these things.

Fourthly / if we refer those words without spot or blemish unto the
commandment (as I for my part think they ought to be) then there is a weight
in these words not to be passed over / which is / yt the apostle will not only
have the rules here contained / not trodden under the feet / or broken in
pieces / but he will not have them so much as in any one small point or specke
neglected. But I see how M. Doctor will wype away all this / and say that these
things / or some of them were to be observed thus necessarily and precisely /
until there were christian princes and peace in the church: but the print is
deeper then that it will be so washed away. Therefore it is to be observed /
what he says in the latter end of the sentence / where he charge Timothe /
and in him all / that he should keep all these things / not until the time
of peace / or to the times of Christian Princes / but even until the coming
or appearing of our savior Christ / which is as long as the world lasts. And
therefore I conclude that the seigniors or elders of the church (being a part of
that order and government of the church / which S. Paul appoynteth in this
Epistle) are necessary / perpetual / and by no means to be changed. So that
we have / not only now the examples of all the primitive churches (which ought
to move us / if there were no commandment) but we have also a straight
commandment: I say the only examples ought to move us / for what way can we
safelyer follow / then the common high way / beaten and trodden by the steps of
all the Apostles / and of all the churches? Things also growing / and being
preserved by the same means by the which they were engendered / why should we
think but that the churches now will prosper by that government / whereby it
first came up? But I say we have not only the examples of the churches / but
we have also commandment and straight charge to keep this office of elders
and auncientes in the church / and therefore it is not only rashness in
leaving the way that the Apostles and churches by the Apostles advise have gone
/ but disobedyence also to depart from their commandment / and to maintain
and defend that we may do so / I can almost give it no gentler name then
rebellion.

Now I will come to Master Doctors reasons which he has in the hundredth and
fourteen / and a hundred and fifteen pages / where he grants that there
were elders in every church in times past / but says that it ought not now so
to be. For says he / the times alter the government / and it can not be
governed in the time of prosperity / as in the time of persecution / under a
christian prince as under a tyrant. Thus he says / but shows no reason /
brings no proof / declares not how nor why prosperity will not bear the
Elders as well as persecution / neither why they may not be under a godly
prince as well as under a tyrant / onles this be a reason / that because the
godly prince does nourishe the church as a cyuill magistrate / therefore the
auncientes may not nourish it as Ecclesiastical overseers.

Now seeing Master Doctor can show us no cause why they may not as well be now
/ as in the time of the Apostles / as well under a christian prince as under a
tyrant / I will show him that although they be always necessary / yet there is
better cause why they should rather be now then in the apostles times / greater
necessyty under a christian prince / then under a tyrant. First of all in the
apostles times it is known that the gifts of the spirit of wisdom /
discretion / knowledge / enduring of travail / were poured forth more
plentifully then ever they were / either before / or shall be after. By reason
whereof the pastoures and mynisters of the churches that were then / were (I
speak generally / and of the estate of the whole Church) better furnyshed with
the gifts needful for their mynistery / then are the mynisters of these
days. Whereupon I conclude that if the aid and assistance of the pastor by the
Elders / was thought necessary by the apostles in those times / when the
mynisters were so well / and so richly replenished with such gifts / much more
is that aid and assistance meet for the mynisters of these days / wherein
their gifts of discretion and knowledge / and dyligence / are not so
plentiful. For if they whose eye sight was so clear to perceive / whose
hands so nimble to execute / had need for their aid / of other eyes and
other hands / then the mynisters now / whose eyes are dimmer / and hands
heavier then theirs were / have much more need of this aid then they had.

Again / if S. Paul did charge the persecuted / and therefore pore churches /
1. Epist. 5. 17.
with the fineding and providing for the senyors in every church (as it
appears in the Epistle to Timothe / where he says that Elders which rule
well / are worthy double honor / whereby he signifies a plentiful reward /
and such as may be fully sufficient for them and their housholdes / as when he
bids that the widow which served the church in attending upon the sick /
and upon the strangers should be honored / that is / have that wherewyth
she might honestly and soberly live) if I say Saint Paul would charge the
churches then with mayntayning the elders / which being poor / were not
sometimes hable to live without some relief from the church / because they
were compelled oftentimes to leave their own affairs / to wait of the
affairs of the church: how much more ought there now to be senyors / when the
churches be in peace / and therefore not so pore / and when there may be chosen
such for the most part thoroughout the realm / as are able to live without
charging the church any whit / as the practice of these days does manifestly
declare.

And if S. Paul that was so desirous to have the gospel adapanon, that 1.
Cor. 9. 18.
is / free and without charges as much as is possible / and so loath to lay any
burden upon the churches / especially those which were poor / did
notwithstanding enjoin the mayntenaunce of the elders unto the churches poor
and persecuted / how much more shall we think / that his mind was that the
Churches which live in peace / and are rich / and may have this office without
charge / ought to receive this order of auncientes?

Moreover those that be learned know / that the government of the church which
was in the apostles times / being partly in respect of the people that had to
do in the elections and other things popular: partly in respect of the pastors
and auncientes Aristocraticall / that is the rule of the best: I say they know
that these gouernmentes do easily declyne into their contraries / and by reason
thereof both the government of those which were most virtuous / might easily be
changed into the government of few of the richest / or of greatest power / and
the populare estate might easily pass to a confused tumulte. Now this
incommoditie were they more subject unto under a tyrant / then under a godly
prince. For they had no cyuill magistrate which might correct and reform those
declyninges when they happened. For the tyrants did not know of it / and if
they had known of it / they would have been glad to see the churches go to
wrack. Therefore now we have a godly civil magistrate / which both will and
ought to remedy such declinings and conuersions of good government into evil /
it follows that this estate and government by auncientes / is rather to be
used under a christian prince then under a tyrant.

Besides this / in the time of persecution all assemblyes of diverse together
were dangerous and put them all in hazard of their life which did make those
assemblies: And therefore if the pastor alone might have ordered and determined
of things pertaining to the church by him self / it had been less danger to
him / and more safety for others of the Church. And therefore if the senyors
were then thought meet to govern the church / when they could not come
together to exercise their functions without danger / much more ought they to
be under a christian prince / when they may meet together without danger.

M. Doctor proceeds / and says it can not be governed in a whole realm /
as it may be in a city or town. This government by senyors is not only in one
city / but also has been of late throughout the whole realm of France /
where there were any churches: and M. Doctor confesses that it was in all the
primitive churches / and therefore not only in one realm / but almost
throughout the whole world / and therefore the large spreading of the church /
can not hinder it. So that the difference lies still in the peace and
persecution of the Church / and not in the capacity and largeness of the
place where the churches abide. So might one reason against the lawful estate
of a Monarchy: For he might say that although the rule of one be needful and
convenient in a household / yet it is not convenient in a town / and although
it be convenient in a town / yet it is not in a city / and although in a
city / yet not in a realm.

To be short says he / when he can say no more / it can not be governed when
it is full of hypocrites / Papists / Atheistes / and other wicked persons / as
in the times of persecution / when there were few or none such. I have showed
before / how great want of knowledge it bewrays / to say that Papists and
Atheistes be of the church / and I love not as Master Doctor does to use often
repetition / but if there be now more hypocrites and other wicked and unruly
parsones in ye church / then there were in the time of persecution (which I will
not deny) the^ there is greater cause now / why there should be senyors in
every church / then there was then when there were fewer. For the more naughty
persons / and the greater disorders there be / the more aid and help has the
pastor need to have / both to find out their disorders / and also when they
have found them out / to judge of the quality of them / and after also to
correct them with the censures of the church / which stands in such
reprehensions private and open / and excommunication / as I have before
rehearsed.

Afterward he asks what senyors may be had in most of the paryshes of
England fit for that office? he asks the same question in the. 133. page /
where he also adds pastors / asking where may be gotten such pastoures as the
authors of the Admonition require / when as they require no other then those
which the word of God requires. Well then if this be a good reason why there
should be no elders in any church / because fit men are not to be gotten in
all paryshes: it follows by M. Doctors reason / that forasmuch as we have not
fit and able pastors for every church / that therefore we ought to have no able
pastor in any church.

And if he will grant that we ought to have able pastoures in as many places
as they may be gotten: how can he deny / that we should have elders in those
churches where fit men may be had. And I say further / where we have an
express commandment laid upon us to do a thing / there all disputations
must cease / of hardenes / of impossibility / or profit / or else of peace.
For first God has not commanded any orders in his church which are
impossible / and if they seem hard / it must be remembered / that the best
and excellentest things are hardest / and that there is nothing so hard /
which dyligence and travail to bring it to pass / will not overcome. Which
thing if it be proved true in worldly affairs / the truth thereof will much
more appear in the matters pertaining unto God / considering that if God with
his blessing do surmount all the difficultyes in worldly matters which are
otherwise hard to be compassed / he will in his own matters / and matters
pertaining to his glory / fill up the valleys / although they be never so low /
bring down the hills / although they be never so high / plain the ways be
they never so rough: so that he will make of a way not passable in the eyes of
flesh / away tracked and easy to go in / and to walk toward that kingdom
/ whereunto he calls us. Besides that / I answer wheresoever there is a
church / there are the riches of the spirit of God / there is with knowledge
/ discretion and wisdom / and there are such as * S. Paul calls wise / 1.
Cor. 10. 15.
and can discern and judge. And we see that when men are called to a lawful
and profitable calling / and especially to a public calling / God does power
on his gifts of that person which is called so plentifully / that he is as it
were suddenly made a new manne / which if he do in the wicked as Saul was /
there is no 1. Sam. 10. 6.
doubt but he will do it in those / which are with the testimony of the church
/ and with experience of their former godly behavior / chosen to such offices
of weight. So that there is not / nor can not be any want to obey Gods
commandment / and to establishe the order in the church which God has
appointed / but our own either negligence and slouthfulnes / or fearefulnes /
or ambition / or some other leven which we nourish within our selves. It is
true / that we ought to be obedyent unto the cyuill magistrate / which
governs the church of God in that office which is committed unto him / and
according to that calling. But it must be remembered / that cyuil magistrates
must govern it according to the rules of God prescribed in his word / and that
as they are nourises / so they be servants unto the church / and as they rule
in the church / so they must remember to subject them selves unto the church
/ to submit their scepters / to throw down their crowns / before the church /
yea as the Prophet speaks / to lick the dust of the Esaias. 49. 23.
feet of the church. Wherein I mean not / that the church does either wring
the scepters out of Princes hands / or takes their crowns from their heads /
or that it requires Princes to lick the dust of her feet (as the Pope under
this pretense has done) but I mean as ye Prophet means / that whatsoever
magnificence / or excellencye / or pomp / is either in them or in their
estates and common wealths / which does not agree with the simplicity / and in
the judgment of the world) poor and contemptible estate of the church / that
that they will be content to lay down.

And here comes to my mind / that wherwyth the world is now deceived / and
wherwyth M. doctor goes about both to deceive him self and others to / in
that he thinks that the church must be framed according to the common wealth
/ and the church government according to the civil government / which is as
much to say / as if a man should fashion his house according to his ha^gings /
when as in deed it is clean contrary / that as the hangings are made fit for
the house / so the common wealth must be made to agree with the church / and
the government thereof with her government. For as the house is before the
hangings / and therefore the hangings which come after / must be framed to the
house which was before: so the church being before there was any common wealth
/ and the common wealth coming after / must be fashioned and made suitable
unto the church. Otherwise God is made to give place to men / heaven to earth /
and religion is made (as it were) a rule of Lesbia / to be applied unto any
estate of common wealth whatsoever.

Seeing that good men / that is to say the church / are as it were the
foundation of the world / it is meet that the common wealth which is builded
upon that foundation / should be framed according to the church / and
therefore those voices ought not to be heard / this order will not agree with
our common wealth / that law of God is not for our state / this form of
government will not match with the policy of this realm.

Now to come again to M. Doctors reasons / he says in the. 133. page / that
if they urge gouernoures because they are spoken of in the. 12. to the Corin.
then they may as well urge the power to work miracles / the gift of healing.
etc. for that they are likewise reckened up in the same place. But does not M.
doctor know / that although some things be extraordinarye / and for a time /
yet other some things are ordinary / and to endure always? Will he say for
that the gifts of miracles and of healing are extraordinarye / therefore the
teachers which are there reckened together with the gift of working miracles
and of healing are extraordinary? has he forgotten that he (in deed untruly)
made before the office of Apostles and Prophets / and Evangelists / a perpetual
office / and yet they are there joined with these gifts which were but for a
time / and therefore it is a very absurd argument to say / that for that some
thing reckened with governors / is for a time / and extraordinary / therefore
the governors be so. As for Musculus authority / which is / that the times do
change the orders / besides that I have answered before / and besides that he
does not speak it of the Elders / I have proved that it can have no place
here / for so much as the Elders are necessary / and commanded in the
scripture.

Unto the authors of the Admonition saying that it is easier to overthrow by
bryving / one man / then the faith and piety of a godly company: he answeareth
/ that so it should come to pass / that the more that ruled / the better estate
it should be / and so the populare estate should be the best. But where do the
authors of the admonition say / that the more that rule / the better it is? is
it all one to say / that the government of a few of the best / is better then
the government of one / and to say / the more that rule the better? If it were
to the purpose / it might be showed both by Diuinitye and by Philosophye /
which M. Doctor speaks of / that that estate which he means / is not the
best: and I have in a word before spoken of it / where I declared that the
mixed estate is best / both by the example of the kingdom of Christ / and
also of this our realm. It is sufficient now to admonyshe you / that although
it be granted that the government of one / be the best in the common wealth /
yet it can not be in the church. For the Prince may well be Monarche immediately
between God and the common wealth / but no man can be Monarche between God and
his church but Christ / which is the only head thereof. Therefore the Monarchy
over the whole church / and over every particulare church / and over every
singular membre in the church / is in Christ alone.

Last of all / to prove that there ought to be no senyors in the church under a
Christian prince / he cites Ambroses authority both in the. 114. and. 132.
pages / which says that the sinagogue or church of the Jews / and after that
the church of the chrystians had senyors / without whose counsel nothing was
done in the church: whereupon he concludes / that for as much as they were not
in Ambrose time / therefore they were not under a christian prince. And here M.
doctor has in one sentence proclaimed both his great ignorance in the whole
storye of the church / and wythall either a marvelous abusion / and suffering
him self to be misled by some unadvised prompter / or subtle fox that
thought to deceyne him / or else a notable evil conscience / which wrastleth
against the truth. His ignorance does appear partly in that he says / that
because there were no senyors in Amb. church / and in those churches about him
/ therefore there was none at all: but most manifestly in that he says / for
so much as there were no senyors in Amb. time / therefore there was none under
a christian Prince / as though there were not many years before Amb. time
christian Emperors / when as between the time of S. Ambrose being bishop / and
the time of Phillip successor of Gordias the first christian Emperor / there is
more then a. 150. years / and between the time of Constantine the Emperor /
and the time of Ambrose being bishop / there be above. 80. years. And if M.
Doctor had ever red the ecclesiastical stories / he might have found easily
the eldershyp most flourishyng in Constantines time / and other times / when
as the peace of the chrystians was greatest.

And that the presbytery or eldershyp endured in the church after Ambrose time
/ and in the time of peace / and as it is very like in Amb. time / although not
where he was / it may be showed plainly by Jerome (which followed Ambrose 4.
Tom. 2. lib. in Isalam.
immediatlye) who in his third chapter upon Esaias / says that they had also
the presbytery or eldershyp in the church. The same might be showed by diverse
other testimonies / which I omit / because that it may appear by the former
treatise touching the election of the mynister / that this order of eldershyp
continued in the church diverse hundredth years after Ambrose time / even as
long almost as there was any sound part of the church / from the head to the
heel. Now I have showed the ignorance / it remains to show how that
either M. Doctor was maruellously him self abused / or else desires to abuse
other. For if whereas he took half Ambrose sentence / he had taken the other
half with him / and had not suddenly stopped his breath that he should speak
no more / in stead of a false wytnes against the eldershyp / he should have
brought forth as clear and as flat a witness for the proof of them / as a man
could desire out of an ancient writer. The whole sentence is this / speaking
of this office of the elders / (although not upon so good occasyon) thus he
says: Whereupon the sinagoge / and Ambrose upon 1. Tim. chap. 5
after the church had elders / without whose counsel nothing was done in the
church / which Elders I know not by what negligence they are worn out / onles
it be through the slouthfulnes of the doctors / or rather through their pride
/ whylest they only would seem to be somewhat.

Now that I have showed the place / I will say no more / I will leave it to M.
Doctor to think of it in his chamber by him self / and so will conclude this
question: that for so much as this order is such / as without which / the
principal offices of charity can not be exercysed: and that it is that which
is commanded by the scryptures / approved and received by all the churches in
the Apostles times / and many hundredth years after in the most flouryshing
churches / both in time of peace / and in time of persecution: and that there
are greater causes why it should be in the time of peace / then in time of
persecution / why rather under a christian prince / then under a tyrant / why
rather now / then in ye apostles times / that in consyderation of these things
/ the eldershyp is necessary / and such an order as the church ought not to be
without. And so also is answered the third question / that for so much as they
were church officers / and over the people in matters Heb. 13. 17.
pertaining to God / and such as watched over the souls of men / that therefore
although they were not pastors to preach the word / yet were they no lay men
(as they term them) but ecclesiastical persons. The rest comprehended in
these sections / is answered before / being matter which pertayned unto the
archbishop.

Now I return back again to Excommunicacion / which M. Doctor thinks to
be the only disciplyne in the church / but he should understand / that beside
that part of private disciplyne / (which is ordinarily and daily to be
exercised by every one of the pastors and elders / as Admonition and
reprehension) there are.iij. princypal parts / which are exercised of them
jointly and together / whereof the first is the election or choice / and the
abdication or putting out of Ecclesiastical officers. The second is in
excommunication of the stubburne / or absolution of the repe^tant. The third is
the decision of all such matters as do rise in the church / either touching
corrupt manners / or perverse doctrine.

As touching the election / and consequently the throwing out / it has been
showed before / that together with the church / the eldershyp has the
principal sway. For the decision of controuersyes when they rise / it may
appear in the. 15. of the Acts / that the Presbytery or Eldershyp of the
church has to determine of that also. Now it remains here / that whereas
M. Doctor says that the Excommunication / and consequently the absolution or
restoryng to the church again / does pertayne only to the minister / that I
show that the Presbyterye or eldership / and the whole church also / has
interest in the Excommunication / and consequently in the absolution or
restoryng unto the church. But here by the way it is to be noted / that in
saying that it belongs to the minister / he confesses the dysorder in our
church / wherein this power is taken away from the minister / and given to the
bishop and his officers.

Now that this charge of excommunication belongs not unto one / or to the
minyster / but cheefely to the eldershyp and pastor / it appears by that
which the authors of the admonition allege out of S. Mathewe / which place I
have Chap. 18. 17.
proved before to be necessarily understood of the elders of the church. It
is most absurdly said of M. doctor in the. 135. page / that by the church is
understood either my Lords grace / or the bishop of the diocese / or the
Chancellor or Commissarye. And that when a man complayneth unto one of these /
he may be well said to complain unto the church: which is the more
intolerable / for that being so strange a saying / and such as may astonyshe
all that hear it / he neither confirms it by any reason / or like phrase of
scripture / or by the authority of any godly or approved writer old or new /
which notwythstanding he seeks for so diligently / and turns the
commentaries in his study so painefully / when he can have but one against
twentye / and but a syllable where he can not have a sentence. It may be the
clearlyer understood / that the presbytery or eldership / had the chief
stroke in this excommunication / if it be observed / that this was the policy
and discipline of the Jews / and of the smagogue from whence our sauyoure
Christ took this / and translated it unto this church / that when any man had
don any thing that they held for a fault / that then the same was punished and
censured by the Elders of the church / according to the quality of the fault /
as it may appear in S. Mathewe. For although it be of some (and those very
learned) Chap. 5. 22.
expounded of the civil judgment / yet for so much as the Jews had nothing
to do with civil judgments (the same being altogyther in the hands of the
Romans) and that the word san^drim, corrupted of the Greek word synedrion,
which S. Mathewe uses / is known by those that have skill in the Rabbis /
and especially the Jews Talmud, to signifye the ecclesiastical governors /
there can be no doubt but he means the ecclesiastical censures. And if the
fault were judged very great / then the sentence of Excommunication was awarded
by the same elders / as appears in S. John. And this was the cause why our
savior Chap. 9. 22.
Christ spoke so shortly of this matter in the. 18. of S. Matthew / without
noting the circumstances more at large / for that he spoke of a thing which was
well known and used amongst the Jews whom he spoke unto. And that this was
the meaning of our savior Christ in those words / it may appear by the
practice which is set forth in the Epistles to the Corinthians. For it is
certain that S. Paul did both understand and observe the rule of our sauyor
Christ. But he communicates this power of Excommunication with the church /
and therefore it must needs be the meaning of our savior Christ / that the
excommunication should be by many / and not by one / and by the church / and
not by the minister of the church alone. For he bids the church of Corinthe
twice in the first Epistle / once by a Metaphore / an other time in plain
words / that they should excommunicate the incestuous person. By metaphore /
saying: (purge out your old leaven) in plain and flat words / when he says
(take away that wicked Chap. 5. 7. 13.
man from amongst you.) And in the second Epistle understanding of the
repentance of that man / he entreats them that they would receive him in
again / 2. Cor. 2. 10.
showing that he was content to release the bond and chain of his
excommunication / so that they would do the same / and therefore consydering the
absolution / or reconciliation of the excommunicate / does pertain unto the
church / it follows that the excommunication does in like manner appertain
unto it.

Now / whereas M. Doctor upon those words of S. Paul / that he being absent in
body / and present in spirit / had determined. etc. concludes yt the right of
excommunication was in S. Paul / and not in the rest / it is as much as if he
should say / S. Paul as much as lay in him excommunicated / therefore s. Paul
excommunicated: or S. Paul excommunicated / therefore the church did not. For
what if S. Paul did excommunicate him so much as lay in him / should he
therefore have been excommunicated / if the church of Corinthe / and the
minyster there would have admitted him to the supper / and not abstain from
familiare companying with him? You will say he should have been bound in
heaven and before God / although the church of Corinthe had not put him forth.
It is true that the apostles denunciation of Gods vengeance upon the impenitent
sinner / is ratifyed in heaven / and so should he also have been if S. Paul
had said nothing / and yet S. Paul did not excommunicate the incestuous
person / but so much as lay in him / and as far as his right stretched: not
being therefore yet excommunicated by S. Paul / it follows that the church had
a stroke in the excommunication. Again / to prove that the church has nothing
to do with excommunication / it is not enoughe to say that S. Paul had the
right of excommunication: But you should have showed that he only had it / and
then you are manifestly convicted by S. Paul's own words / which joins the
church with him in that excommunication / saying that he had decreed that the
doer of that fact (by his spirit / and them gathered together in the name of
Jesus Christ / and by his power) should be given to satan. And if the right
of excommunication were only in S. Paul / how is it that you said before /
that it is in the minister of the church? had the minister of the church of
Corinthe nothing to do? And if it were in S. Paul alone / why does he chide
with the church / that they had not already excommunicated him before he wrote
unto them to signifye his will to excommunicate? or if it were in the minister
of the church only / why w^^ S. Paul chide and sharply rebuke the church / for
that the incestuous man was not cast forth? Why does he charge the Corinthians
with that which was the only fault of the minister?

An other objection M. doctor has out of the.16. of S. Matthew / and the 20. of
John / in which places because he gives power to the.xij. to bind and to lose
/ M. Doctor will conclude that they only have power to bind and to lose.
Solomon says that the just man is first the accuser of himself / and
therefore it Prou. 18. 17.
behooved M. doctor or ever he should have accused the authors of the Admonition
of dalying and vnreuerent handlyng of the scriptures / to have first of all
spoken to him self / and have stricke^ him self upon the thigh. For if this
be not to abuse the scriptures / I know not what is to abuse them / for to let
pass that some and of the ancient writers do expound the place of S. Mathewe
of every membre of Christ / and of as many as have faith to confess Christ to be
the some of God / and so by that means to have power of excommunication / I
say to let that go / M. doctor might easily know if he would / that in that
pla^e our sauyor Christ speaks of the binding and losing which ^^y ye
preaching of the word of God / standing in threats and promyses / and
therefore that binding pertayneth only unto the ministers / to whom the
preaching does only belong. But in the.18. of S. Mathewe where he speaks of
the binding and losing by excommunication and receiving to the church again /
there he attributes this power unto the church. He has an other objection out
of S. Paul to Timothe / where for that it is said that s. Paul did
excommunicate Hymineus and Alexander / he concludes after his old manner /
that therefore he only excommunicated. But for so much as I have proved that
both the rule of Christ / and the practice of S. Paul according to that rule /
be otherwise / it can not be that S. Paul did excommunicate him self alone
those persons: for then he should disagree both with our sauyor Christ and
with him self. But as I have showed before in other ecclesiastical actions and
exercises of discipline / that one man is said to do that which was done of
many / for because one was moderator of that action or exercise: so s. Paul
here says that he did excommunicate / not that he did it by him self alone /
but because he was president and chief in that action. And although it should
be granted (which can not) that S. Paul did excommunicate himself alone
(being an apostle / or for one time) yet it neither follows that the bishop or
minister may do that which the apostle did / or that he may do continually ye
which was done but once and extraordinarily. As for the place of Titus the
third / it makes nothing to excommunication / onles you would conclude that
for that S. Paul bids Titus to trouble himself no more with confuting an
obstinate heretic / therefore he bids him excommunicate an heretic by him
self. As touching Bafiles place in the second book of Offices when the book
comes forth and is Printed / then it shall be answered / as for me I know of
none such that is extant now. To the rest I will answer with this protestation
/ that if all men should do contrary to the order of God / yet their authority
or example ought not to have the weight of a fether / which I have said before
/ and do understand it in all places where I do not expres it / and with this I
come to M. doctors authorities.

And as for Theodoretus bishop of Laodicea / which Sozomene makes mention of
in his sixthe book / I find none such / but there is mentioned of one
Theodotus / who is said to have separated or excommunicated Apollinaris / but
it does not appear there that he alone of his own authority did excommunicate
him. And there be great reasons in that Chapter / to prove that he did it not
of his own authority / for immediately after his heresy was known / Damasus
bishop of Rome / and Peter bishop of Alexandria / caused a sinode to be
gathered at Rome / where his heresy was condemned. Now for so much as the
custom of synodes and councels is / when they condenme the heresies / to
excommunicate the heretics / it is to be thought that that council did
excommunicate him / and that Theodotus bishop of Laodicea / did execute that
decree and excommunication. And in deed Sozomene does so expound him self /
when immediately after he had said that he did excommunicate him / he adds
acoinonetoh auton apophainei, which is / that he declared him excommunicate /
which in deed properly belongs to the minister / when the excommunication is
decreed by those to who^ it appertains. Which thing may yet better appear by
the manner of speech which is used in an other place / where speaking of
^ictor excommunycating Theodotus / he utters it by this apekeryxe, which is
to promulgate or pronounce the sentence which was decreed by others. As for
Amb. although he be greatly commended for excommunicating the Emperor / yet he
was never commended / for that he did excommunicate him himself alone: and if
he did excommunicate him himself alone / yet his fault was the les / for so
much as he being desirous of an eldershyp / could not as it seems by his
complaint (which I have spoken of before) ^^^aine one. And although the stories
do not make mention y^ there were others / whose authority came into this
excommunication / yet it follows not y^ there were no other. And how often
will you stomble at that / which you do so sharply reprove in others / which is
in making of arguments of authority negatiuely? And if you will not grant this
manner of reasonyng in the scripture / in matters pertaining to the government
of the church / which are all comprehended in the scripture / how would you
reason of a common story / which neither can / nor does profess to speak all
those things which fall into that matter which it writes of? But what if so be
it be proved that Ambrose did not this of his own authority / but by the
authority also of others / will you then confess that he is commended of all
those which write stories for so doing / and confess that the use and practice
of the primitive church was far from this that is now? For proof whereof I
will give you a place which Ambrose the best wytnes of this matter has in one
of his epistles / where he shows that as soon as the murder which Theodosius
had caused to be done at the city of Thessalonica was Epist. 38.
heard / by and by the bishops of France came and there was holden a Synod:
where also Ambrose says / that his communicating with Theodosius / could
Ambros. lib. de obitu Theodos.
not absolve him (for that as it might appear) the bishops in that synod had
in excommunicating him / ordained that he should not be absolved until such
time as he had done repentance / which he did afterward with confession of his
fault before the congregation / and asking forgeuenes of it. So it appears
that that which he did / he did it by the sentence of the synod / and not of
his own authority alone. In the. 220. and 221. pages / he speaks of this
thing a fresh / but has no new matter / but makes a bare rehersall of the
places of the admonition / asking after his accustomed manner of confuting /
what makes this or what proves that? only whereas he said before / and proved
(as he thought) that the minister had only to do with excommunication / being
pressed there / by the admonition either to defend or renounce his
Chauncellors. etc. he had rather deny both the truth and himself / then he
would have any of that horrible confusion and profanation of the holy
discipline of God (brought in by popery threatnyng the overthrow of the whole
church / and serving for nothing but for the nourishing of the ambition and
idleness of a few) driven out of the church. Of the which I will upon occasion
speak a word / if first I show that the use of the ancient church has been
not to permit the excommunication to one / but that the sentence thereof should
come from the governors and elders of the church / unto whom that did
especially appertain. Although I can not pass by that which M. doctor says /
that for so much as the authors of the Admonition had alleged the words (tell
the church) to prove the interest of the church in excommunication / that
therefore they could not use the same to prove the interest of the pastor / as
who should say that the pastor is not one of the church. But of the absurdity
of this / I have spoken sufficiently before / and how all men do see the vanity
of this reason / that because yt people have an interest by this place /
therefore the pastor has none. But I come to show the use of the primitive
church in this matter / whereof we have a manifest testimony in Tertullian. If
(says he) there be any which has committed Tertull. in Apolog. 39. ^.
such a fault that he is to be put away from the partakyng of the prayer of
the church / and from all holy matters or affairs: there do bear rule or be
presidents certain of the most approved ancients or elders / which have
obtained this honor / not by money / but by good report. And that the ancients
had the ordering of these things / and the peoples consent was required / and
that if the case were a very difficult case / it was referred unto the synodes
or councels / and that the ministers did not take upon them of their own
authority to excommunicate / and that those which did receive the excommunicate
without the knowledge and consent of the church were reprehended / it may
appear almost in every page of Eib. 3. ep. 8. 10. 14. 19. 1. Lib. 3. epi. 3.
lib. contra. ep. Parmen.
Cyprians Epistles / and namely in these which I have noted in the margent.

In Augustines time it appears also / that the consent of the church was
required / for in the third book against the epistle of Parmenian / he shows
that if the multitude of the church be not in that fault for which one is to be
excommunicated / that then it helps much to make the party both afraid and
ashamed / that he be excommunicated or anathematised (as he calls it) by all
the church / and in his books de Baptis. contra Donatistas, in diverse places
/ he is so far from permitting the excommunication to one man / yt he seems to
fall into the other extremity / which is to make the estate of the church to
populare / and the people to have too great a sway. For there he shows / that
if the most of the people be infected with the fault which is to be punyshed by
excommunication / that then no excommunication ought to be attempted / for
because a sufficient number of voices will not be obtained for the
excommunication. By which testimonies / besides the institution of God / and
the practice of the churches in the apostles times / appears manifestly what
has been the use of the churches touching excommunication / as long as there
was any purity in the church. And it is to be observed here / that both in
this part of the discipline / and also in all other parts of it (as I have
showed) as in harder and difficulter causes / things were referred unto the
Synodes prouincial / national / or general / as the case required: so if the
elders of any church shall determine any thing contrary to the word of God /
or inconueniently in any matter that falls into their determination / the
parties which are grieved / may have recourse for remedy / unto the elders and
pastoures of diverse churches / that is to say unto Synodes of shires / or
dioceses / or provinces / or nations of as great or of as small compass as
shall be thought convenient by the church / according to the difficulty or
weight of the matters / which are in controversy. Which meetings ought to be as
often as can be conveniently / not only for the decision of such difficultyes
which the several presbyteries can not so well judge of / but also to the end
that common counsel might be taken for the best remeady of the vices or
incommodities which either the churches be in / or in danger to be in. And as
those things which can not be decided by the Eldershyp of the churches are to
be reserved unto the knowledge of some Synod of a shire or diocese: so those
which for their hardness can not be there decided / must be brought into the
Synodes of larger compass as I have showed to have been done in the apostles
times / and in the churches which followed them long after.

These things standing in this sort / all those Courts of bishops and
archbyshoppes must needs fall / which were by Antichrist erected against this
lawful jurisdiction of Eldership / as the court of faculties / and those
which are holden by chauncellors / commissaries / officials / and such like /
the describyng of the corruptions whereof / would require a whole book / of
which I will note the principal heads and sums.

First / for ye they enter into an office which pertains not unto them / but
to every particulare church / and especially to the eldershyp or gouernoures of
the church / and therefore although they should do nothing but that which were
good / lawful / and godly / yet can they not approve their labors unto men /
much les to God / puttyng their sickle in an other man's harnest. For neither
by the truth of the word of God does that appertain unto them / neither by
M. Doctors own judgment (if his yea were yea / and his nay nay) consydering
that he said before / that this jurisdiction belongs to the ministers. And
although it should pertain unto the Bishop / (as he is called) to whom
notwythstanding it does not appertain) yet were it not lawful for him to
translate this office unto an other / and to appoint one to do it when he
lysteth / no more then he can appoint them to do his other offices of
ministering / as preaching the word / and ministering the sacraments.

An other thing is / that in these courts (which they call spiritual) they take
the knowledge of matters / which are mere civil / thereby not only perverting
the order which God has appointed / in seuering the civil causes from the
ecclesiastical / but iustling also with the civil magistrate / and thrusting
him from the jurisdiction / which appertains unto him / as the causes of the
contracts of marriage / of divorces / of wills and testaments / with diverse such
other like things. For although it appertain to the church and the governors
thereof / to show out of the word of God which is a lawful contract or just
cause of divorce / and so forth / yet the judicial determination / and
definitive sentences of all these / do appertain unto the civil magistrate.
Hereunto may be added / that all their punishments almost are penalties of
money / which can by no means appertain to the church / but is a thing merely
civil.

Thirdly / as they handle matters which do not appertain unto the
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction / so those which do appertain unto the church /
they do turn from their lawful institution / unto other ends not sufferable /
which M. doctor him self does confess in excommunicating for money. etc.

Last of all they take upon them those things / which are neither lawful for
civil nor ecclesiastical jurisdiction / nor simply for any man to do / of
which sort diverse are reckened up by the admonition / and same confessed by M.
Doctor. I will not here speak of the unfitness of those which are chief
officers in these courts / that the most of them are either papists / or
bribers / or drunkardes / (I know what I write) or epicures and such as live of
benefices and prebends in England or in Ireland / doing nothing of those things
which appertain unto them / and of other such naughty persons which are not
only not meet to be governors in the church / but which in any reformed church
/ should not be so much as of the church. I speak not of all / I doubt not
but there be some do ye which they do of conscience / and with mind to healpe
forward the Church / which I trust will (when the Lord shall give them more
knowledge) keep them selves in their vocations / and being men for their
gifts apt and able either to serve the Church or the common wealth in some
other calling / will rather occupye their gifts there / then where they have no
ground to assure them selves / that they do please God. Now I will take a
short survey of that which M. doctor alleges to prove his offices of master
of faculties / chancellors. etc. First he says in ye. 117 page out of the
Ancyran council / yt there were vicars of bishops / where although y^ name be
not found of cha^cclors. etc. yet there is (says he) the office. What vicar s.
Paul's B. may have / and in what case / I have showed before / where I have
proved the necessary residence of every pastor in his flock. But I will note
here how M. Doctor both go about to abuse his reader in these vicares. And
first where there were three editions / of which one only makes mention of
these vicares he took that and left the other / which is to be observed / for
that this variety of editions rose of the diverse understanding of the greek
word (chorepiscopos,) which may be taken either for him that is bishop for an
other / and in his place / or for him that is bishop in the country / that is
in some town which is no city / so that chorepiscopus, was opposed unto the
bishop which was of some city. And if it be so taken / then here is no proof
for the vicarse of bishops. But howsoever it be / it shall appear that the
names of chauncelors and / chorepiscopos, do not so much differ / as the
offices and functions of them. For it appears in the same Council and Canon
/ that they were like the. 70. disciples / that they had also some care to
provide for the poor / and that they were such as did mynister the
sacraments. And in an other Council / they have authority given them to
Antiochen. cap. 10.
make subdeacons / exorcists / and readers. I know this was a corruption of the
mynistery / but yet all men see / how Master Doctor looks as it were a far
of upon things / and therefore takes a man for a molehill / when he would make
us believe that these were chauncelors. etc.

In the. 125. page to the admonition desyring that these may be removed and the
eldershyp establyshed according to Gods order / M. Doctor answers / that
that were to place instead of wise and discrete men / unlearned / ignorant and
unapt to rule. Let Master Doctor take heed / least in alowing so well of the
popish ceremonies / not only as tolerable / but as fit / and then
acquainting him self with the papists manner of speaking / in saying that the
people be ignorant and unlearned / he fall or over he be aware into some worse
thing. Moses in Deuteronomie / Deuteronomy. 4. 6. Prou. 1. ^. Psa. 25. 12. 14*
and Solomon in his proverbs / place the principal wisdom in keeking Gods
commandments and in fearing God. And David says / that the secrets and
the privy council of the Lord / is known to those which fear him / and I
have showed out of S. Paul / that he gives to the spiritual man great 1.
Cor. 2. 15.
discretion and judgment of things. If therefore there be in every church
which fear God and keep his commandments / there are both wise and learned
and discrete men / and therefore not to be spoken of so contemptuously as M.
Doctor speaks. And God be praised there are numbers in the church / that are
hable to be teachers unto most of the chauncelors / in any matter perteyning to
the church / and are hable to give a ryper judgment in any ecclesiastical
matter / then the most part of them can.

And besides that the choysest are to be taken to this office / this ought not
to be forgotten / that seeing good success of things depend upon the
blessing of God / and that blessing follows the church when the Lords order
is kept / simple men which carry no great countenance or show / will
undoubtedly do more good unto the church / having a lawful calling / then
those of great port which have no such calling.

In the. 228. page he thinks the Archbyshoppes Court necessary / but
brings no reason / and further confesses him self ignorant of the estate
of it / and therefore I know not from whence that good opynion of his should
come / unless it be from thence that he lyketh of all things be they never so
evil which the admonition missyketh. The rest which M. D. has of this matter
is nothing else but great and high words. And as for the Canon law / it is
known what a stroke it bears with us / and that a few cases excepted it
remains in her former effect.

To the sections beginning in the. 118. page / and holding on until the. 123.
page.
It was before showed that of the gouernoures of the church / there were some
whose charge pertayned unto the whole church / of the which we have spoken:
some other / whose charges extend but to a part of the church / that is unto
the poor / and these are the deacons. And as in the former part I showed there
were two kinds / so in this latter part ye same is to be noted / that of those
whose charge was over the poor / some had charge over all the poor of the
church (as those which are called deacons) some had charge over the poor
strangers / and those poor which were sick only / and those S. Paul calls
in one place Dyaconisses / and in an other place widows. For the deacons did
distribute unto the necessyties as well of the poor strangers and the sick
poor / as unto the other 16. Romans 1. 1. Ti. 5. 10.
poor of the church. And the widows did employ their labors to the washing
of the feet of the strangers / and attending upon the poor which were sick
/ and had no friends to keep them. First I will speak of the deacons / and
whereas M. Doctor cries out of daiying with the scriptures / for alleging
the. 8. verse of the twelfth unto the Romans / to prove deacons / affirming
that there is no word of them: Truly I can find no words to set forth this
so gross ignorance. And had it not been enough for M. Doctor to have uttered
this ignorance / but he must also with an outery proclayme it / and as it were
spread the banner of it? What do these words note (he that distributeth in
simplicity) but the office of the deaconshyp. For in that place S. Paul
reckeneth up all the ordinary and perpetual offices of the church / as the
office of the doctor / of the pastor / of the deacon / of the elder / and
leaves not out so much as the widow / which he comprehends in these words
(showing mercy). If the authors of the Admonition do daily with the scriptures
in this place / surely Master Calvin / M / Beza / M. Bucer / Peter Martyr.
etc. do dally with them. And shall all these be esteemed to play with the
scriptures / and M. Doctor only to handle them seriously? And as M. Doctors
ignorance appears in this place / so his mind not desirous of the truth /
but secking to cavil / does as manifestly show it self. For all men see /
that the admonition alleges not the place to the Tessalonians to prove the
office of deacons / but to show that idle vagavondes might not have any of that
relief / which belongs unto those which be poor in deed / which thing
appears both by the placing of the quotation over against that allegation /
and by the letter which directs thereunto. And whereas M. Doctor says / that
the office of the deacons is not only to provide for the poor / but also to
preach and mynister the sacraments / I have showed before / that it does not
appertain unto them / to do either the one or the other. For the proof
whereof / this place of the Romans quoted by the admonition / is very fit and
most proper. For S. Paul speaks there against those which not contenting
themselves with their own vocatio^s / did break into that which appertayned
unto others / as if the hand should take upon it the office of the eye / or of
some other member of the body / and therefore S. Paul does (as it were) bound
and point the limits of every office in ye church / and so places the deacons
office only in the preuysion for the poor. This one thing I will add to that
matter / that if the apostles which had such excellent and passing gifts /
did find them selves (preaching of the word / and attending to prayer) not
able to provide for the poor / but thought it necessary to dyscharge them
selves of that office / to the end they might do the other effectually and
fruitefully / he that shall do both now / must either do none well and
profitably / or else he must have greater gifts then the Apostles had.

The second point is touching that there were deacons in every church / which
is well proved of the admonition / both by the place of the Phillippyans / and
of the Acts / for although it be not there said / that the deacons were in
every church / yet for so much as the same use of them was in all churches
which was in Jerusalem and at Philippos / and for that the Apostles (as has
been before touched) laboring after the uniformity of the church / ordained
the same officers in all churches / the proof of one is the proof of all /
and the showing that there were deaco^s in one church / is ye showing in all.
The place which they allege out of the first to Timothe / is of all other most
proper: for S. Paul there describing not how the church of Ephesus / but
simply and generally how the church must be governed / reckneth there the order
of deacons. Whereunto may be added the contynuall practice of the church long
after the Apostles times / which appears by the often superscriptions and
subscriptions in these words (the bishop / elders / and deacons of such a
church / and unto the bishop / elders / and deacons of such a church). And by
that it is so often times said in the councelles where the churches assembled /
y^ there were so many bishops / so many elders / so many deacons.

The third point in this deaconship is / whether it be a necessary office in
the church / or for a time only / which controversy should not have been / if
M. Doctors english tongue had been agreeable with his latin. For in a certain
latin pamphlet of his / whereof I spoke before / he makes the deaconship a
necessary office / and such as ought not to be taken out of the church: here he
sings a another song. There / because he thought the necessity of the deacon
made for him / he would needs have deacons: here because it makes against him
he says there is no need of them / whereby appears how small cause there is
/ that M. Doctor should vpbrayde the authors of the admonition with mutability
and discord with them selves. But that this office is durable and perpetual /
it may appear by that which I have alleged before out of the sixth of Timothe
/ for the necessity of elders: for the arguments serve to prove the
necessity of those orders which are there set forth / whereof the deacon is
one. And where as M. Doctor says that every church is not hable to find a
curate (as he terms him) and a deacon / I have before showed / entreating of
the senyors / that the churches in the Apostles times / might best have said
this / being poor and persecuted / although I see not why the church may not
have a deacon or deacons (if more be needful) with as small charges as they
may have a collector or collectors.

There remains to speak of the widows / which were godly poor women in
the church above the age of. 60. years / for the avoiding of all suspicion 1.
Timo. 5. 9.
of evil which might rise by slanderous tongues / if they had been younger.
These as they were norished at the charges of the church being poor / so did
they serve the church in attending upon poor strangers and the poor which
were sick in the church / whereof they were widows. Now although there is
not so great use of these widows with us / as there was in those places where
the churches were first founded / and in that time wherein this order of
widows was instituted / part of the which necessity grew both by the
multitude of strangers through the persecution / and by the great heat of
those east countries / whereupon the washing and supplyng of their feet was
required: yet for so much as there are poor which are sick in every church /
I do not see how a better and more convenient order can be devised / for the
attendance of them in their sickness and other infirmities / then this which S.
Paul appoynteth / that there should be (if there can be any gotten) godly poor
widows of the age which S. Paul appoynteth / which should attend upon such.
For if there be any such poor widows of that age destitute of all friends /
it is manifest that they must needs live of the charge of the church / and
seeing they must needs do so / it is better they should do some duty for it unto
ye church again / the^ the church should be at a new charge to find others to
attend upon those which are sick and destitute of keepers / seeing that there
can be none so fit for that purpose as those women / which S. Paul does there
describe: so that I conclude that (if such may be gotten) we ought also to keep
that order of widows in the church still. I know y^ there be learned men which
think otherwise / but I stand upon the authority of Gods word / and not
upon the opynions of men be they never so well learned. And if the matter also
should be tried by the judgment of men I am able to show the judgment of as
learned as this age has brought forth / which thinks that the institution of
widows is perpetual / and ought to be where it may be had / and where such
widows are found. In deed they are more rare now then in the Apostles
times: For then by reason of the persecution / those which had the gift of
continency / did abstain from marriage after the death of their husbands / for
that the sole life was an easyer estate and less dangerous and chargeable
when they were driven to fly / then the estate of those which were married.
Unto all the rest until the end of the first part of the admonition I have
answered already. Yet there is a point or two / which I must touch whereof the
first is in the. 126. page / where he would bear men in hand / that the
authors of the admonition and some other of their mind / would shut out the
cyuill magistrate and the Prince / from all authority in Ecclesiastical
matters / which surmise although I see it is not so much because either he
knows or suspecteth any such thing / as because he means hereby to lay a
bayte to entrappe with all / thinking that where he makes no conscience to
give he cares not what authority to Princes / we will be loath to give more
then the word of God will permit / whereby he hops to draw us into displeasure
with the Prince: yet for because he shall understand / we norish no opynions
secretly which we are ashamed to declare openly / and for that we doubt not of
the equity of the prince in this part / which knows that although her
authority be the greatest in the earth yet it is not infinite / but is
lymitted by the word of God / and of whom we are persuaded that as her majesty
knows / so she will not unwillingly hear the truth in this behalf / these
things I say being considered / I answer in the name of the authors of the
admonition / and those some other which you speak of / that the Prince and
cyuill magistrate has to see / that the laws of God touching his worship /
and touching all matters and orders of the church be executed and dewly
observed / and to se that every Ecclesiastical person do that office whereunto
he is appointed / and to punish those which fail in their office accordingly.
As for the making of the orders and cerimonyes of the church / they do (where
there is a constituted and ordered church) pertayne unto the mynisters of the
church and to the ecclesiastycall gouernoures / and that as they meddle not
with the making of cyuill laws and laws for the common wealth: so the cyuill
magistrate has not to ordain ceremonies pertaining to the church. But if
those to whom that does appertain / make any orders not meet / the
magistrate may and ought to hinder them / and drive them to better / for so
much as the civil magistrate has this charge to see that nothing be done
against the glory of God in his domynion.

This distinction if M. Doctor knows not / nor has not heard of / let him
look in the. 2. book of the Chronicles / he shall see / that there were a
number appointed 1. Cro. 19. 8. 11.
for the matters of the Lord / which were priests and levites / and there were
other also appointed for the Kings affairs and for matters of the common
wealth / amongst which were the Levites / which being more in number then
could be applied to the use of the church / were set over cyuill causes /
being therefore most fit / for that they were best learned in the laws of God
/ which were the politic laws of that country. There he may learn if it
please him / that the making of orders and giving of judgments in cyuill and
Ecclesiastical / in common wealth and church matters / pertayned unto diverse
persons / which distinction the writer to the Hebrews does note / when he
says that the Heb. 5. 1.
Priest was ordained in things pertaining to God.

This might Master Doctor have learned by that which the noble emperor Eusebius.
li. 2. de vita Constant. ep. ad Eusebius.
* Constantine attributes to the fathers of the Nicene council and to the
Ecclesiastical persons there gathered: which he does also permit the Bishops /
Elders / and Deacans of churches to do / either by correcting or adding / or
making new if need be. And by the contynuall practice of the church in the
time of christian Emperors / which always permitted unto the mynisters
assembled in Sozom. li. 1 cap. 17.
councelles / as well the determynation of controversies which rose / as the
making or the abolishing of needful or hurtful ceremonies / as the case
required. Also by the Emperoures epistle in the first action of the council of
Constantinople where by the epistle of the Emperor it appears / that it was
the manner of 2. Tom. con. 5. lib. ep. 32.
the Emperoures to confirm the ordinances which were made by the mynisters /
and to see them kept. The practice of this he might have also most plainly
seen in Ambrose / who would by no means suffer that the causes of the churches
should be debated in the Princes consistory or court / but would have them
handled in the church / by those that had the government of the church: and
therefore excuses him self to the emperor Valentinian / for that (being
conuented to answer of the church matters / unto the civil court) he came
not. And by whom can the matters and orders of the church be better ordained
/ then by the mynisters of the church? And if that be a good reason of Master
Doctor in the forty and seventh page / that the Bishops ought therefore to
ordain mynisters / because they are best hable to judge of the learning and
habylitie / of those which are the fyttest / it is also as good reason / that
therefore the mynisters and governors of the church should appoint and decree
of such ceremonies and orders as pertayne to the church / for because it is to
be supposed that they can best judge of those matters / bestowing their studyes
that ways / and further best understanding the estate of the church about the
which they are wholly occupied. And this is not (Master Doctor) to shake hands
with the papists. For the papists would exempt their priests from the
subjection / and from the punishment of the cyuill magistrate / which we do
not. And the papists would that whatsoever the clergy does determyne / that
that forthwith should be holden for good / and the Prince should be forthwith
compelled to maintain and set forth that / be it good or evil / without
further inquiry: but we say that if there be no lawful mynistery to set good
orders (as in rumous decays and overthrows of relygion) that then the Prince
ought to do it: and if (when there is a lawful mynistery) it shall agree of
any unlawful or unmeet order / that the Prince ought to stay that order / and
not to suffer it / but to drive them to that which is lawful and meet. And if
this be to shake hands with the papists / then Master Doctor is to blame /
which has taught us once or twice before / that the appoynting of ceremonies
of the church / belongs unto the church. And yet I know that there is one or
two of the later writers / that think otherwise / but as I take no advantage
of their authority which think as I do / so I ought not to be prejudiced by
those / that think otherwise. But for so much as we have M. Doctor yet of this
judgment / that the church ceremonies should be ordained by the church / I
will travail no further in this matter / consydering that the practice of this
church commonly is to refer these matters unto the ecclesiastical persons:
only this is the difference / that where it is done now of one or a few / we
desire that it may be done by others also / who have interest in that behalf.

The other point is in the hundredth thirty and eight page / where he most
untruly and slanderously charge the authors of the Admonition / and makes
wonderful outcryes of them / as though they should deny that there had been
any reformation at all / sythens the time that the Queens majesty began to
reign / manyfestly contrary / not only to their meaning / but also to their
very words / which appears in that they move to a thorough reformation / and
to contend / or to labor to perfection / denying only that the reformation
which has been made in her majesty's days / is thorough and perfect. We
confess willingly / that next unto the Lord God / every one of us is most
deeply bound unto her majesty / whom he has used as an excellent instrument
to deliver his church here / out of the spiritual Egypt of popery / and the
common wealth also / and the whole land out of the slavery and subjection of
strangers / whereunto it was so near: This I say we willingly confess before
men / and do in our prayers daily give most humble thanks to God therefore.

And by this humble suit and earnest desire which we have for further
reformation / we are so far from unthankfulness unto her majesty / that we
thereby desire the heap of her felicity / and the establishment of her royal
throne amongst us / which then shall be most sure and unremoved / when our
savior Christ sytteth wholly and fully / not only in his chair to teach / but
also in his throne to rule / not alone in the hearts of every one by his
spirit / but also generally / and in the visible government of his church by
those laws of discipline / which he has prescribed.

And whereas M. Doctor would bring us into a foolish paradise of our selves /
as though we need not to learn any thing at the churches of France and
Scotland / he should have understood / that as we have been unto them in
example / and have provoked them to follow us / so the Lord will have us also
profit / and be provoked by their example / and so be mutual helps one to an
other / and stir up our selves with the admonition that our savior Christ
stirred up his apostles / that oftentimes those that are first / are not
forwardest / but are ouerrun 20. Math. 16.
of others that come after. And whereas he would privily pinch at the
reformation there / for so much as the Lord has humbled the one / and
exercises the other by cyuill wars and troubles / he should have in stead
of rocking us a sleep in our security / put us in remembrance of Gods
scourges which hang over us / and of Gods great patience that still taryeth for
our repentance / and that if he have punyshed that people of his which have
suffered so much for the profession of the Gospel / and which went with so
straight a foot in it / with an universal hazard of their goods and lives /
that we shall not escape unless we repent spedely of our coldness and halting
in relygion / and unwillingness / I will not say to hazard to put our lives in
danger / but not to leese some of our wealth and honor / for the obtaining of
a through reformation of the church / and advancement of the glory of the
Lord.

Finally / he would rather have put us in remembrance of the sermon which our
savior Christ makes / where he shows that those cities are not alwares Luke
13. 2. etc.
the greatest sinners / or those whom God is most angry with / which have the
heauiest judgments executed upon them / but that thereby the Lord calls us
to repentance / otherwise that we shall likewise pearish. This had been more
fit forourestate to have been said / then to have after a sort insulted upon
the afflicted / and daubed up our eyes that we should not see our mysery and
our nakedness. In all the rest / M. Doctor has nothing but words of reproach
against the authors of the Admonition / and calling still as his manner is /
for more punishment for them / which I will not bestow the answer of.

The reply unto the section in the. 146. 147. 148. pages.
Sed etiam quodam in loco facetus esse voluisti, Deus bone, quam te illud non
decet.

Here M. Doctor was disposed to make him self and his reader merry / but it is
with the bagpipe or country mirth / not with the Harp or Lute / which the
learned were wont to handle. For he has packed up together the old tale of
the cursed wife / and of the thief that took away the priests purse / very
familiar and homely gear: It might peradventure make M. Doctor hop about the
house / but the learned and the wise can not dance by this instrument. It
pleases M. Doctor to compare those which be put out of their lyuings without
just cause / to heretics / cursed wives / and to thieves / but all men do
understand how rightly. What his troubles be within / and in his conscience /
the Lord God and he knows best / but as for the outward persecution which
he suffers / it is not such / as he need thus to stoop or to groan / and to
blow underneath it / as though he had some great burden upon his shoulders.
And if he complain of the persecution of the tongue / to let pass his
immoderate heat of speech / which he uses with those that he has to do with
all / the tongue which is more intemperate then his is in all his book / shall
hardly be found. And although it be unreasonable enough / that he should not
give men leave to complain of their troubles / when he gloryeth in troubling
them / yet that of all is most intolerable / that besides ye injury which he
does the^ / he is angry ye they will not lay hands of the^ selves by casting
the^ selves out of their lyuings / or ever they be cast out by him. Tullie
makes me^tio^ of one C. Funbria / which when he had caused Q. Sceloua a
singular in a^ to be wounded / and saw that he dyed not of it / conue^ted him
before the judges / and being asked what he had to accuse him of / answered /
for that he did not suffer the whole weapon wherewith he was stricken / to
enter into his body: even so M. Doctor contenteth not him self only to do
injuries unto men / but accuses them also / that they will not do it unto the^
selves / or that they would not willingly suffer his weapons enter so far as
he would have them. What conscience is there that binds a man to depart from
his living / in that place where he lyketh not of all the orders which are
there used? is it not enough to abstain from the^ / if there be any evil in
them / or to declare the unlawfulness of them / if his calling do suffer him /
when as the reformation is not in his power. And if either of this abstayning
or declaration of this unlawfulness of them / troubles be moved / there is no
more cause why they should give place / then the other which like of those
disorders / yea there is less cause / for that they are not the causes of
trouble / but the other / and for that by their departure out of their places /
room is made for those which will like of those disorders which the other
mislyked / which is to the hurt of that company or congregation in such places.
And as for M. Doctors easynes to depart from his living / rather then he would
cause any trouble / he gives men great cause to doubt of / which having
diverse great lyuinges / and amongst them a benefice is very loath to go from
troubling of others / to do his duty at any of them. It is true / that the
church of England may have an order whereunto it may justly require the
subscription of the mynisters in England: And so is it likewise untrue / that
we desire that every one should have his own fansy / and live as him lists /
for we also desire an uniform order / but such and in such sort / as we have
before declared. As for the old accusation of Anabaptisme and confusion / it
is answered before: therefore according to my promise / I will leave your
words / and if you have any matter / I will speak to that.

Unto the. 149. and. 150. pages.
THe Admonition has no such thing / as M. Doctor charge the authors thereof
with / that they did ever allow of the book of service. It says they bare
with it / and used it so far / as they might / and therefore now when it came
to the approving of it by subscription / they refused / and there is no man
which can not understand / that it is one thing to bear with a thing / and an
other to approve it / and therefore to bear / and to use it so far as might
be / may well agree with their refusal of subscription / so that M. Doctors
note is not worth the noting. The Apostles did bear with the infirmity of the
Jews addicted to the observation of the ceremonial law / yet they never
allowed that infirmity / and they were so far from approving it by
subscribing / that they wrote against it. Those (says M. D. which authorized
this book / were studious of peace / and of building of Christ's church /
therefore they that speak against it (which he calls defacing) are
disturbers of the peace / and destroyers of the church. So I will reason:
Gedeon was studious of peace / and of building of the church / therefore they
which spoke against the Ephod which he made / were disturbers of the peace /
and destroyers of the church. We speak against images in churches / and
consubstantiation in the sacraments / and such like / which Luther being
studious of peace / and of the building of the church did hold / and yet we
are not therefore disturbers of peace / or destroyers of the church. Although
they were excellent personnages / yet their knowledge was in part / and
although they brought many things to our light / yet they being sent out in the
morning / or ever the sun of the gospel was risen so high / might ouersee
many things which those that are not so sharp of fight / as they were / may
see / for because that which they want in the sharpnes of sight / they have by
the benefit and clearenesse of the sun and of the light. They sealed not the
book of service with their blood (as M. Doctor says) for some that suffered
for the truth / declared openly their myslyking of certain things in it / and
as for the other they could never dye for that book / more then for the
lyturgie used in the French church / or at Geneua. For they received not the
sentence of condemnation / because they approved that book / but because they
improued the articles drawn out of the mass book. And if they had dyed for
that book (as in deed they dyed for the book of God) yet the authority of
their martyrdom / could not take away from us this lyberty that we have to
enquire of the cause of their death. Justin and Cyprian were godly martyrs /
and yet a man may not say / that they sealed their errors which they wrote with
their blood / or with this glory of their martyrdom / prejudice those which
speak or write against their erroures: for this is to oppose the blood of men
/ to the blood of the son of God. For the papists triumph I have answered
before / and I will not strive about the Goats wolle / who is the opponent /
and who the respondent in this difference.

From the. 151. page unto the. 171. page / all is answered where these things
which are here joined / are severally handled / now unto that in the. 171.
and. 172. pages.
I answer / ye although it be meet / that as we hope that the homylies which
are made already be godly / so those that shall be made hereafter / shall be
likewise: yet considering the mutabilitie of men / and that oftentimes to the
worse / it is not meet / nay it is merely unlawful / to subscribe to a
blancke / seeing that we can not witness or allow of those things which we
have not seen nor heard. The place unto the Corinthes / is the same unto the
Romans / and M. Doctor approving one / has no cause to find fault with the
other. For the homylies first of all I have showed / how absurd a saying / and
how unlike a dyuine it is / to match reading of homylies / with preaching of
sermons. For if the reading of the holy scriptures is nothing so fruitful as
the preaching of them / much less is the reading of homylies to be for their
fruit matched with preaching of sermons. There remains that I show briefly /
that neither the homylies nor the Apochripha / are at all to be red in the
church. Wherein first it is good to consider the order which the Lord kept
with his people in times past / when he commanded Exodus 30. 29.
that no vessel / nor no instrument either beesome / or flesh hook / or pan.
etc. should come into the temple / but those only which were sanctified / and
set apart for that use. And in the book of Numbers / he will have no other
trumpets blown Numb. 10. 2.
to call ye people together / but those only which were set apart for y^
purpose. What should the meaning of this law be? The matter of other common
vessels and trumpets / was the same oftentimes which theirs was / the same
form / also and the other beesomes and hooks / and trumpets hable to serve
for the uses of sweeping and sounding. etc. as well as those of the temple /
and as those which were set aparte / wherefore might not these then as well be
used in the temple as others? Forsothe / because the Lord would by these
rudiments and pedagogie teach / that he would have nothing brought into the
church / but that which he had appointed / no not although they seemed in the
judgment of men / as good as those things which God him self had placed
there. Which thing is much more to be observed in this matter / seeing that the
homilies red (be they never so learned and pithye) neither the Apochrypha / are
to be compared either in goodness within themselves / either in fruit or in
effect toward the hearer / with the authentical scriptures of God. Now / if
a man will say that the Homilies do explane and lay open the scriptures / Psalm.
19. 7. Prou. 1. 4.
I answer that the word of God also is plain and easy to be understood / and
such as gives understanding to idiotes and to the simple. And if there be
hardness in them / yet the promise of the assistance of Gods spirit / that God
has given to the reading of the scriptures in the church / which he has not
given to homilies / or to the Apochrypha / will be able to weigh with the
hardness / and to overcome it / so that there shall easily appear greater
profit to come unto ye church by reading of the scriptures / then by reading of
homilies.

Besides this / the policy of the church of God in times past is to be followed
herein / that for the expounding of darker places / places of more easines
ought to be joined together / as in ye persecution of Antiochus / where they
could not have the commodity of preaching / the Jews did appoint at their
meetings always a piece of the law to be red / and with all a piece of the
prophets which expounded y^ piece of the law / rather then to bring in
interpretations of men to be red. And because I am entered into that matter /
here comes to be considered the practice also of the church both before our
savior Christ's coming / and after / that when Acts. 13. 15. Acts. 15. 21.
the churches met together / there is nothing mentioned but the reading of ye
scriptures / for so is the Lyturgie described in the Acts. And it is not to be
thought / but that they had those which made expositio^s of the law and the
prophets. And besides that / they had Onkelos the Calday paraphrast / both
Galatine / and Rabby Moses (surnamed Maymon) write / that Jonathan an another of
the Calday paraphrasts floryshed in our sauyor Christ's time / whose wrytings
and paraphrases upon the scryptures / are esteemed comparable in that kind of
paraphrasticall writing / with any which has labored that ways. And if any
men's wrytings were to be red in the church / those paraphrases which in
explanyng ye scripture / go least from it / and which keep not only the number
of sentences / but almost the very number of words / were of all most fit to
be red in the church. Seeing therefore (I say) the church of God then abstained
from such interpretations in the church / and contented it self with the
scryptures / it can not be but a most dangerous attempt / to bring any thing
into the church to be red besides the word of God. This practice continued
still in the churches of God after the apostles times / as may apeare by the
second Apology of Justin Martyr / which shows that their manner was to read
in the church the monuments of the prophets and of the apostles / and if they
had red any thing else / it is to be supposed that he would have set it down /
consydering that his purpose there / is to show the whole order which was used
in their churches then. The same may appear in the first Homilye of Oregine
upon Exodus / and upon the Judges. And as for M. Bucers authority / I have
showed before how it ought to be wayghed / and here also it is suspicious: for
that it is said that his advise was / when the lord should bless the realm
with more learned preachers / that then order should be taken to make more
homilyes / which should be red in the church unto the people: As if M. Bucer
did not know / that there were then learned preachers enough in the realm /
which were able to make homilies / so many as the volume of them might easily
have exceeded the volume of the Bible / if the multitude of homilyes would have
done so much good. And if the authority of M. Bucer bear so great a sway with
M. Doctor / that upon his credit only without either scripture or reason / or
examples of the Churches primitive / or those which are now / he dare thrust
into the church homilies / then the authorities of the most ancient and best
councels ought to have been considered / which have given charge / that nothing
should be red in the church / but only the canonical scriptures. For it was
decreed in the council of Laodicea / ye nothing should be red in the church /
59. can. council. Laod. Tom. 1. council. Conc. Valense. 1. Tom.
but the canonical books of the old and new testament / and reckeneth up
what they be. Afterward as corruptions grew in the church / it was permitted
that homilies might be red by the deacon / when the minister was sick / and
could not preach / and it was also in an other council of Carthage permitted /
that the martyrs lives might be red in the church. But besides the evil
success that those decrees had (under pretense whereof the popish legende /
and Gregory's homilies. etc. crept in) that use and custom was controlled by
other councels / as may appear by the counsel of Colen / albeit otherwise
popish. And truly if there were 4. Tom. council. 6. c. council. Colon. part. 2.
nothing else but this consideration / that the bringing in of the reading of
Martyrs lives into the church / and of the homilies of ancient writers / has
not only by this means iustled with the Bible / but also thrust it clean out of
the church / or into a corner where it was not read nor seen / it ought to
teach all men to beware of placing any writing or work of men in the church of
God / be they never so well learned / as long as the world should endure.

And if any man object / that by this means also is shut out of the church
the form of ordinary prayers to be said: I say the case is nothing like / for
when we pray we can not use the words of the scripture / as they orderly lie in
the text. But for so much as the church prays for diverse things necessary
for it / the which are not contained in one or two places of the scripture /
and that also there are some things which we have need of / whereof there is
no express prayer in the scripture: it is needful / that there be a form of
Prayer drawn forth out of the scripture / which the church may use when it
meets / as the occasyon of the time does require / which necessity can not
be by no means alleged in the reading of Homilies or Apochrypha. Whereupon
appears that it is not so well ordained in the church of England / where
both Homilies and Apochrypha are red / especially when as diverse chapters of
the books called Apocrypha / are lyfted up so high / that they are sometime
appointed for extraordinary lessons upon feasts days / wherein the greatest
assemblies be made / and some of the chapters of the canonical scripture (as
certain chapters of the Apocalipse) quite left out and not red at all.

Unto the two next sections I have answered before / where I have entreated of
holy days / and of kneeling at the Communion / it follows to speak unto the
section contained in the. 183. and. 184. pages.
ALthough it will be hard for you to prove that this word (priest) comes of
the Greek word (presbyteros) yet that is not the matter / but the case stands
in this / that for so much as the common and usual speech of England is / to
note by the word (priest) not a minister of the gospel / but a sacrificer
(which the minister of the gospel is not) therefore we ought not to call the
ministers of the gospel (priests) and that this is the English speech / it
appears by all the English translations / which translate always (hiereis)
which were sacrificers (priests) and do not of the other side (for any that
ever I red) translate presbyteron, a priest. Seeing therefore a priest with us /
and in our tongue / does signifye both by the papists judgment in respect of
their abominable mass / and also by the judgment of the protestant in
respect of the beasts which were offered in the law / a sacrificing office
(which the minister of the gospel neither does nor can execute) it is
manifest / that it can not be without great offense so used.

The next three sections I have before answered / where I have spoken of the
abuses in baptism / crossing / and interrogatories / it follows to speak
unto the section contained in. 194. 195. and. 196. pa.
IF it be M. Bucers judgment which is alleged here for the ring / I see that
sometimes Homere sleapeth. For first of all I have showed / that it is not
lawful to institute new signs and sacraments / and then it is dangerous to
do it / especially in this which confirms the false and popyshe opinion of a
sacrament / as is alleged by the admonition. And thirdly / to make such fond
allegories of the laying down of the money / of the roundnes of the ring / and
of the mystery of the fourth finger / is (let me speak it with his good leave)
very ridiculous and far unlike him self. And fourthly / that he will have the
minister to preach upon these toys / surely it sauoreth not of the learning
and sharpnes of the judgment of M. Bucer. And whereas M. doctor / upon that s.
Peter wills the husbands to give honor to their wives / would approve this
manner of speech in matrimony (with my body I thee worship) he must understand
that it is one thing with us to worship / and an other thing to honor. For we
honor men which we do not worship / and besides that S. Peter speaks of the
honor of the mind / whereby the husband should be moved to bear with the
infirmities of his wife / and therefore it is unfitly alleged / to prove that
he may worship her with his body.

As for the receiving of the Communion when they be married / that it is not to
be suffered (onles there be a general receiving) I have before at large
declared / and as for the reason that is fathered of M. Bucer / (which is /
that those that be Christians / may not be joined in marriage / but in
Christ.) It is very slender and cold / as if the sacrament of the supper were
instituted to declare any such thing / or they could not declare their joining
together in Christ by no means / but by receiving the supper of the Lord.

To the next section in the. 197. page.
TEll me M. doctor why there should be any such confirmation in the church /
being brought in by the fained Decretall Epistles of the Popes / and no one
tittle thereof being once found in the scripture / and seeing that it has been
so horribly abused / and not necessary / why ought it not to be utterly
abolyshed? and thirdly / this confirmation has very dangerous points in it.
The first step of popery in this confirmation / is the laying on of hands
upon the head of ye child / whereby the opinion of it / that it is a sacrament
is confirmed / especially when as the prayer does say / that it is done
according to the example of the Apostles / which is a manifest untruth / and
taken in deed from the popish confirmation. The second is / for that the
bishop (as he is called) must be the only minister of it / whereby the popish
opinion which esteems it above baptism is confirmed. For whilst baptism
may be ministered of the minister / and not confirmation / but only of the
bishop / there is great cause of suspicion given to think / that baptism is
not so precious a thing as confirmation: seeing this was one of the principal
reasons / whereby that wicked opinion was establyshed in popery. I do not here
speak of the inconvenience / that me^ are constrained with charges / to bring
their children oftentimes half a score miles for that (which if it were
nedeful) might be as well done at home in their own parishes. The third is /
for y^ ^^ the allegation of the second cause of the using of the confirmation
/ the book says / that by the imposition of hands and prayer / the children
may receive strength and defense against all temptations / whereas there is no
promise / that by the laying on of hands upon children / any such gift shall
be given / and it maintayneth the popyshe distinction / that the spirit of God
is given at baptism unto the remissyon of sins / and in confirmation unto
strength / the which very word (strength) the book alleges / and all this
M. Doctor confuteth by calling of the authors Lomb. lib. 4. Diuis. 7.
of the admonition peevish and arrogant.

To the next section contained in the. 198. 199. 200. 201. pages.
LEast M. Doctor (as his common fashyon is when the corruption of any thing is
spoken against) say that we condemn buryall / I would have him understand /
that we hold that the body must be honestly and comely buried / and that it is
mete / that for that cause some reasonable number of those which be the friends
and neyghbors about / should accompany the corpse to the place of buryall. We
hold it also lawful to lament the dead / and if the dignity of the person so
require / we think it not unlawful to use some way about ye burial / whereby
that may appear / but yet so / that there be a measure kept both in the
weepyng and in the charges / consydering that whereas immoderate either weepyng
or pomp was never / no not in the time of the law allowed / now in the time
of the gospel / all that is not lawful / which was permitted in the time of
the law. For unto the people of God under the law / weeping was by so much more
permitted unto them / then unto us / by how much they had not so clear a
revelation and plain sight of the resurrection as we have / which was y^ cause
also why it was lawful for them to use more cost in the embaulmyng of the dead
/ thereby to nouryshe and to help their hope touching the resurrection / whereof
we have a greater pledge by the resurrection of our sauyor Christ / then they
had. Now for the things which the admonition finds fault with / and thereof
brings reason / M. Doctor of his bare credit without any reason or scripture
/ or any thing else / commends them unto us / and says they be good. And
this you shall mark to be M. doctors simple shyft throughoute his book / that
when he has no color of scripture / nor of reason / no name nor title of
doctor / the^ to make up some thing / he varyeth his affirmation by all the
figures he can / as in saying simplye that it is so / and then in askyng
whether it be not so / and after in askyng whether there is any other man will
think that it is not so / as if the would make us believe / that he sets
us diverse kinds of meats / because he brings the same in diverse dyshes. For
besides these reasons / he has no reason / either to prove that it is meet
to have prescript form of service for the dead / or that the minister should
be drawn to this charge. Surely if the order be so good and convenient / it
has met with a very barren patron / which can say nothing for it. And although
there be enough said by the admonition / yet because this bold and hardy
speech is enough to lead the simpler away / and to make them think that M.
doctor has a good cause / therefore I will also say somthyng of these rites of
buryal.

And first of all / as this almost is a general fault in them all / yt they
maintain in the minds of the ignorant the opinion of praying for the dead: so
is this also a another general fault / yt these ceremonies are taken up without
any example / either of the churches under the law / or of the purest churches
under the gospel / that is / of the churches in the apostles times. For when
the scripture descrybeth the ceremonies or rites of buryall amongste the people
of God so dilygently / that it makes mention of the smallest things / there is
no doubt but the holy Ghost does thereby show us a pattern / whereunto we
should also frame our buryalles. And therefore for so much as neither the
church under the law nor under the gospel / when it was in the greatest
puritye / did ever use any prescript form of service in the buryall of their
dead / it could not be but dangerous / to take up any such custom / and in
the time of the law it was not only not used / but utterly forbidden. For when
the law did forbid that the priest should not be at the buryall / Leu. 21. 1.
11.
which ought to say or conceive the prayers there / it is clear y^ the Jews
might not have any such prescript form. And yet they had most need of it / for
the causes of obscure knowledge / and weaker faith before alleged. Again / by
this means a new charge is laid upon the minister / and a taking him away
from his necessary duties of feeding and governing the flock / which being so
great as a marvelous diligence will scarcely overcome / ought not to be made
greater by this / being a thing so unnecessary. The Admonition does not say
that the Prayers which are said / are for the dead / but that they maintain an
opinion of prayer for the dead in the hearts of the simple / and that they
declare manifestly enoughe / when they say that it may be partly gathered. etc.

For the mournyng apparel / the admonition says not simply it is evil
because it is done of custom / but proves that it is hypocritical oftentimes
/ for that it proceeds not from any sadness of mind / which it does pretend
/ but worn only of custom / there being under a mourning gown of tentimes a
merry heart. And considering that where there is sorrow in deed for the dead /
there it is very hard for a man to keep a measure that he do not lament too
much: We ought not to use those means whereby we might be further provoked to
sorrow / and so go a great way beyond the measure / which the apostle apoynteth
in mournyng / no 1. These. 4. 13. Math. 9. 23.
more then it was well done of the Jews in the gospel to provoke weping and
sorrow for their dead by some dolfull noise or sound of instrument / or then
it was lawful for Mary Lazarus sister to go to her brothers grave / thereby
to set the John. 11. 31.
print of her sorrow deper in her mind. Seeing therefore if there be no sorrow /
it is hypocritical to pretend it / and if there be / it is very dangerous to
provoke it / or to carry the notes of remembrance of it / it appears that this
use of mourning apparel were much better laid away then kept. And here M.
doctor threps a little kindness of the authors of the admonition / and says that
they know it is very ancient / whom before he denies to have any knowledge of
antiquity. In deed it is very ancient / but M. doctor is afraid to show the
ancienty of it / for Cyp. and Aug. inueigh Cypr. 4. sermon. de mortalitate. Aug.
lib. 2. de consolar. mortuorum.
vehemently against it / condemnyng it as unlawful and indecent.

Now touching the funeral sermons M. doctor takes on / and tryumpheth
maruellously / as though he had already gotten the victory: but he that
girdeth his harnes / should not boast as he that puts it of. There is more
matter then peradventure M. doctor is aware of / and that which is set down /
he answeareth not: as that it norysheth an opinion that the dead are the better
for it / which does appear in ye there are none more desirous of funeral
sermons / then the papists / which although they can not abide the doctrine
which is preached / yet they will have such sermons / and those which will very
seldom / or not at all / be at other sermons / will not commonly miss one of
these. Furthermore / for so much as the minyster is driven oftentimes by this
means to preach upon a sudden / the word of God thereby is negligently handled
/ especially of those whose gifts are not so great / as that they can provide
in so small time / and by this neglygent handlyng of the word of God / it is
brought into contempt.

Moreover / consydering that these funeral sermons are at the request of rych
men / and those which are in authority / and are very seldom at the buryall
of the pore / there is brought into the church (contrary to the word of God) an
acceptance of persons / which ought not to be. For although the minister may
give to one more honor then to an other / according as the calling or degree
requires / yet in his mynistery / and that which pertains unto his office /
he ought to show himself indifferent / and therefore preach as well at the death
of the pore / as of the rych: and because he can not well do both / it is most
convenient to leave both. If so be that M. doctor will say / that it is good
that notable and famous men should have their commendation / to the end that
both the goodness of God toward them / might be the better known / and
others the sooner drawn to follow their example: I grant it is so / and the
scripture does both approve it / and shows what mean is best to do that
by. For so we read that Jeremy the prophet commended that godly and zealous
prince Josias / in writing verses of his death. 2. Chro. 35. 25
He could have as easily preached / but this he thought the best way. So did
also David write verses at the death of Saul / and Jonathan and Abner / in
which 2. Sa. 1. 17. etc. 2. Sa. 3. 33. etc
he commends their gyfts and graces which the Lord had bestowed upon the^.
There were in deed of ancient time funeral orations / as appears in Gregory
Nazianzen / but they sauoured of the manner of Athens / where he was brought
up: where also this custom of funeral orations was used / as may be seen in
the second book of Thucydydes story by an oration of Pericles. And although
this custom was not in Nazianzeus time / so corrupt as afterward: yet the
departing from the examples of the purer churches / gave occasion of further
corruption which ensued. And to say the truth / it was better used amongst the
Athenians / then amongst the christians. For there it was merely civil / and
the oration at the death of some notable personage / made / not by a minister /
but by an Orator appointed therefore: which I think may well be done. And if M.
doctor will say / that there might be sermones / although they be not mentioned
neither in the old testament nor in the new: I have answered before / that
seeing the holy ghost does describe so dilygently the least circumstances of
burial / he would not have omitted that / being the greatest. And let it be
observed / that this devise of man's brain brings forth the same fruit that
other do / ye is / dryueth quite away a necessary duty of the minister / which
is / to comfort with the word of God / the parties which be grieved at the
death of their friends / that considering the sore is particular / he apply unto
it a particular plaster which is very seldom or never done / and yet a
necessary duty / as of a good christian / so especially of the minister /
which can best do it / and to whom it most appertains. And whereas M. doctor
asks / when there is a better time to speak of death and of mortality then
at buryall / surely if it had been so fit / the Prophets and apostles would
never have lost that opportunity / or let pas that occasion of advancing and
making effectual their preaching. What if it be answered / that for as much
as our life is a continual meditation of death / it is not salfe to use this
custom / for that it tyeth our cogitation to so short a time as the time of
buryall is / which ought to be extended to the whole course of our life. But I
answer / that it may be well done without any such funeral sermons when the
minister takes occasion of ye death of any which is lately departed / to
speak of the vanity of ye life of man. Whether M. doctor lyketh the
reformation or no / so it is in the church where M. Calvin was pastor / and
has been for these many years. And although the English church in Geneua had
that in the book of common prayer / yet (as I have heard of those which were
there present) it was not so used. And if it had been / yet thereby it is not
proved that M. Calvin allowed of it. For with things wherein there was no great
and manifest disorder / M. Calvin did bear that which he lyked not of. And
there being no papists in all the city / and al being well instructed / there
was no such danger in a funeral sermon there / as is here amongst us / where
there is many papists / and mo ignorant. I will say nothing of the great abuse
of those / which having otherwise to live on of the church / take nobles for
every such sermon / and sometime a mourning gown / which causes the papists
to open their mouths wide / and to say / that the merchandise of sermons is
much dearer then of the mass: for that they might have for a grote or six
pence / and the sermon they cannot have under a rou^der sum. That must be
remembered which I had almost forgotten / how untruly and slanderously M.
doctor says / that the authors of the admonition do compare ye sermon with a
trentall or a mass. For when I say in stead of the mass we have the holy
Communion / do I compare / or lyken the communion to the mass? and yet this
is M. doctors charitable collection / which gathers things which no man
lets fall. Touching the place of buryall / I have spoken before. And
although it be not to be mislyked / that there should be a common place to bury
in / yet the places which M. doctor poynteth us unto / prove the clean
contrary. For by the story of Abraham's place of buryall / it appears that the
manner was that every one was buried in his own several ground / as may
appear also by that that the evangelist says / that there was a field bought
Math. 27. 7.
to bury the strangers in / which had no place of their own / which was also
used sometimes in the churches under the gospel / as appears by the story of
Theodoret / which I have before recited / and in the later end of a funeral
oratien / which Gregory Nazianzene made of the death of his brother Cesarius.
And so by this reason M. doctor would have every one buried in his own
possession.

To the next section I have answered before / where I have entreated of
churchyng women / and of prayer / it follows to speak unto that / in the.
205. and. 206. pa.
TO pas by the profane proverb here used / which matcheth mad men and women /
and children together / most unseemly for a D. of divinity / especially
handling divine matters: for the singing of psalms by course / and side after
side / although it be very ancient / yet it is not comme^dable / and so much
the more to be suspected / for that the devil has gone about to get it so
great authority / partly Socrat. 6. lib. 8. cap. Platina cap. Damas. Theodo. 2.
lib. 24. cap.
by deriuing it from Ignatius time / and partly in making the world believe /
that this came from heaven / and that the angels were heard to sing after this
sort / which as it is a mere fable / so is it confuted by hystoriographers /
whereof some ascribe the beginning of this to Damasus / some other unto
Flauianus and Diodorus. From whence so ever it came / it can not be good /
considering that when it is granted y^ all the people may praise God (as it is
in singing of psalms) there this ought not to be restrained unto a few / and
where it is lawful both with heart and voice to sing the whole psalm / there it is
not mete yt they should sing but the one half with their heart and voice / and
the other with their heart only. For where they may both with heart and voice
sing / there the heart is not enough. Therefore besides the incommodity which
comes this way / in that being tossed after this sort / men can not
understand what is song / these other two inconveniences come of this form of
singing / and therefore is banyshed in all reformed churches.

Unto two very good reasons which the admonition uses / to show the
inconnenience of making curtesy / and standing at the name of Jesus / and at
the gospel / rather then at other names of God / and the rest of the
scripture: whereof the one is / that it is against decencye and good order which
is broken by scraping of the feet / and the other y^ it may bread a dangerous
opinion of the inequality either of the son of God with the other persons /
or of the gospels with other scriptures / M. doctor says y^ it is an indifferent
thing / and neither takes away their reasons / nor sets down any of his
own: this is a sle^der defense. And it is no malicious dealing / to note those
faults which are so general and so open / and yet notwtstanding uncorrected or
unreformed by those / by whom M. d. would make us believe / yt the church is best
governed. But I pray you tell me / why do you co^demn the serving of two cures /
ye allow the having of two benefices? If it be no fault to have two benefices /
how is it one to have two cures? for ye curate is better able to read his
service in.ij. places / the^ the pastor to discharge his office in.ij.
churches. As for ye speech of ye cathedral churches / either it is nothing / or
else it is false. For if he say y^ there is either in all those cathedral churches
one / or in every of those. 12. churches one / which is able to confute
papists. etc. what great thing says he / which says no more of all these
churches / then is to be found in one poor house of the university / whose
rents are skarce three hundred pound by year? yea what has he said of them
which was not to be found in them even in Queens Maryes time / when there was
yet some one almost in every Church / which for fear dissemblyng / was able
notwythstanding to confute the Papists / Anabaptists / Puritanes. And if he
mean that in those.xij. houses / the worst of the Prebendaries are hable to
defend the truth against all Papists. etc. all men do know the untruth of it /
so that although this sentence be very doubtfully put forth / yet how so ever
it be taken / it is as M. Doctor has ryghtly termed it / a mere brag. And yet
I doubt not / and am well assured / that there be diverse godly learned men
which have lyuings in those places / but for all that they cease not therefore
to be dens of loyterors and idle persons / whylest there are nouryshed there
some which serve for no profitable use in the church (their offices being such
as bring no commoditye / but rather hurt / of which number certain are which
the Admonition speaks of in the. 224. page:) some other which having charges
in other places under the color of their prebendes there / absent them selves
from them: and that which they spoil and raven in other places / there they
spend and make good cheer with / and therefore not without good cause called
dens. Finally / there being nothing there / which might not be much better
applied / and to the greater commodity of the church / whylest they might be
turned into colleges / where young men might be brought up in good learning /
and made fit for the service of the church and common wealth / the
universities being not able to receive that number of scholars / wherwyth their
need may be supplied.

And where M. Doctor says / that that which is spoken of the Queens maiestyes
chapel / is worthy rather to be punyshed then confuted: if so be that these
be abuses / the example of them in her majesty's chapel / can not be but most
dangerous / which with all humble submission and reverence / I beseech her
majesty duly to consider.

And as for the reasons which M. doctor brings to establishe them in the 225.
page / as that they are necessary (which he does barely say) and that s. Aug.
allows of a Deane / and that the authors of the Admonition are instruments of
those which desire the spoil of them / and that a man may as well speak
against universities and colleges / as against them / I have answered before
/ saving that it is to be feared / that colleges in universities (if M. doctor
may work y^ which he goes about) will shortly be in little better case / then
those cathedral churches / which not only by his own example / but with might
and maine / and al endeavor possible / goes about to fill and fraught them with
Non residences, and such as have charges of churches in other places: which do
no good in the university / and partly are such as can do none / only are
pernicious examples of riotous feasting and making great cheer / with the
prays and spoils which they bring out of the country to the great hurt of the
university presently / and utter ruin of it hereafter / onles spedy remedy be
therefore provided. And where he says it is not material / although these deanes
/ vicedeanes / canons / peticano^s / prebe^daries. etc. come from the pope / it
is as if he should say / that it skilleth not although they come out of the
bottomless pit. For whatsoever comes from the Pope which is Antichrist /
comes first from the devil: and where he adds this condition (if it be
good. etc.) in deed if of the eggs of a cockatrice can be made wholesome meat
to feed with / or of a spiders web any cloth to cover with all / then also
may the things that come from the Pope and the Devil / be good / profitable /
and necessary unto the church. And where he says that collegiate churches are
of great auncientie / he proves not the auncientie of the cathedral churches
/ onles he prove that cathedral and collegiate be all one. But I will not
stick with him for so small a matter / and if our controversy were of the
names of these churches / and not of the matter / I could be content to grant
his cause in this point as good as antiquity without the word of God (which is
nothing but rottennes) could make it. But for so much as those ancient
collegiate churches were no more like unto these which we have now / then
things most unlike: our cathedral churches have not so much as this old worn
cloak of antiquity / to hide their nakedness / and to keep out the shoure. For
the collegiate churches in times past were a senate Ecclesiastical / standing
of godly learned mynisters and elders / which governed and watched over that
flock which was in the city or town where such churches were / and for that
in such great cities and towns commonly there were the most learned pastors
and auncientes / therefore the towns and villages round about in hard and
difficult causes / came and had their resolutions of their doubts at their
hands: even as also the Lord commanded in Deuteronomie / that when there was
any great matter in the country / which Deuteronomy. 17. 8. 9.
the Levites in matters pertaining to God / and the Judges in matters
pertaining to the common wealth / could not discuss / that then they should
come to Jerusalem / where there was a great number of Priests / Levites / and
learned Judges / of whom they should have their questions dissolved / and this
was the first use of collegiate churches. Afterward the honor which the smaller
churches gave unto them / in asking them counsel / they took unto them selves
/ and that which they had by the curtesy and good will proceeding of a reverent
estimation of them / they did not only take unto them of right / but also
possessed them of all authority of hearing and determyning any matters at all.
And in the end they came to this which they are now / which is a company that
have strange names and strange offices / unheard of of all the purer churches
/ of whom the greatest good that we can hope of is / that they do no harm.
For although there be diverse which do good / yet in respect that they be
Deanes / Prebendaries / Canons / Petycanons. etc. for my part / I see no
profit but hurt come to the church by them.

And where he says they are rewards of learning / in deed then they should
be / if they were converted unto the mayntenance and bringing up of scholars /
where now for the most part / they serve for fat morsels to fill (if it might
be) the gredy appetites of those / which otherwise have enough to live with /
and for holes and dens to keep them in / which either are unworthy to be
kept at the charge of the church / or else whose presence is necessary and
duetifull in other places / and for the most part unprofitable there.

Last of all / whereas M. Doctor says that we have not to follow other
churches / but rather other churches to follow us / I have answered before /
this only I add / y^ they were not counted only false Prophets which taught
corrupt doctrine / but those which made the people of God believe / that they
were happy when they were not / and that their estate was very good / when it
was corrupt. Of the which kind of false prophecy / Jeremy especially does
complain. And Iere. 6. 14. Iere. 8. 11.
therefore onles M. Doctor amend his speech / and leave this crying peace /
peace / all is well / when there are so many things out of order / and that not
by the judgment of ye admonition and favorers thereof only / but eue^ of al
which are not willingly blind / I say if he do not amend these speches / the
crime of false prophesy will sit closer unto him / the^ he shall be ever able to
shake of / in the terrible day of the lord.

The next section I have answered in the treatise of the archbyshops / it
follows to speak unto the remnant of that section which is contained in the.
214. 215. 216. 217. 218. pages / for unto a part thereof which is comprehended
in the. 213. and a piece of the. 214. page / I have answered in the same
treatise of the Archbyshops.
THe places alleged by the Admonition to prove that mynisters of the church
may not intermeddle with civil functions (one only excepted) are well and
fitly alleged: and most of them used to that end of writers / which if I
should name / all would confess / that they are such / as with whom M. Doctor
is not worthy to be so much as spoken of the same day.

For the first place / if so be that the mynister ought rather to leave
necessary 9. Luke 60. 61
duties of burying his father / and saluting his friends undone / then that he
should not accomplysh his ministry to the full: much more he ought not to
take upon him those things / which are not only not necessary duties / but as
it shall appear / do in no case belong unto him. And although it may be
applied to all Chrystians / yet it does most properly belong unto the
mynisters. And as for the other place of Luke / touching our sauyoure Christ's
refusal to divide the 12. Luke. 14.
inheritance between the brethren / it is most aptly alleged to this
purpose. For although our savior Christ does not there take away from men /
authority to judge / yet he shows thereby sufficiently / that it belongs
not unto the ministers of the word / to intermeddle in the judgment of cyuil
causes. For our savior Christ framed that answer / having respect to the
bounds of his calling.

For as he being a Minister of the Gospel / did all those things which were
pertaining to his mynistery: So by refusing this office of judgment in cyuill
causes / he gave to understand that it did not appertain unto the compass of
that office / which he exercised / which was the ministry. And therefore it is
altogether out of season that M. D. here alleges / that the Anabaptists use
this reason to prove that christians may not have magistrates. For how does
this follow / that because this place of S. Luke proves not / that we ought to
have no christian magistrates: that therefore it proves not / that the minister
should be no magistrate / as if there could be no civil magistrates /
unless ministers of the word were.

And the place which he alleges out of the learned man / does not only not
make any thing for him / but does quite overthrow his cause. For he says that
our savior Christ did not refuse this as a thing in it self unlawful / but
because it did not agree with his vocation. Now the vocation of our savior
Christ / was to be a mynister of the gospel / therefore it does not agree with
the vocation of a mynister of the gospel to judge or to entermeddle in cyuill
government. And if M. Doctor had been so studious of M. Caluins works / as by
his often allegation of him / he would make the world believe / he might have *
red in him 4. li. Inst. 11. cap.
this sentence cited for this purpose / to prove that the ministers have not to
do with civil things. Furthermore M. D. asks what S. Paul's place to the
Romans (where he wills that he which has an office / must wait of that
office 12. Romans 7.
he that teaches of his teaching) makes to this purpose. Surely M. Doc. very
much. Neither can there be a place more properly alleged / both for the very
playnes of the words / and also for the circumsta^ce of the place. For S. Paul
speaks there against those / which would ouerreach their callings / and
having certain callings / contented not them selves with them / but would
have an ore in every man's boat / and would take more upon them then they were
able to do / or the measure of their gifts would stretch unto. And therefore
shows / that as the body is best preserved when every member thereof does his
office / and destroyed when one member will take upon it to do the office of an
other: so the church is then best governed / when every Ecclesiastical person
keeps him self within the limits of his calling / not meddling with that
which pertayneth unto an other. But M. Doctor says that the bishop
governs as well by disciplyne as by preaching: so he does. But I pray you by
what dysciplyne? what a reason is this / he governs by discipline / ergo, by
civil disciplyne. You say in the next sentence that the authors of the
admonition either dote or dream: But if these be your sharp disputations /
when you are awake? surely they are very blunt when you dream. But I had
rather judge the best / that Master Doctor was ouer-watched.

The last place which is alleged by the admonition / is out of the epistle to
Tim. 2. Epist. 2. 4.
where it shows / that for so much as the estate of a minister / is as that
of a soldier / and therefore as the souldyer / to the end he might the better
please his captain / and do his service of warfare / quitteth all those
things which he loves / and whereof otherwise he might have care / and might
enjoy: even so the mynister ought to dispatch him self of all those things
which may be any let to the office of his mynistery / although he might
otherwise lawfully use the^. And if so be for the performing of ye ministry to
the full / he must quite those things which he may lawfully use / how much more
might the admonition conclude that he ought not to entangle himself with those
things / which (out of the places of S. Luke / and to the Romans) it had
showed to be unlawful for him to meddle with? And although M. D. say the
sentence be general / yet it is particularly meant / and most properly of the
mynisters / which Master Calvin teaches M. Doctor in the same place / where
he has cited his authority twice to no purpose. For what although M. Calvin
do not there apply in prescript words this sentence to prove that mynisters
ought not to meddle with cyuill offices / does it follow therefore that this
place can not be used thereto? In saying that he ought to abstain from all
lets which may hinder his vocation and ministry / he does consequently say /
that he ought to abstain from all civil offices. And if so be M. Doct. had
been so well red in the ancient doctors (as he would seem) he might have
known that this place is used of * Cyprian / to the same purpose that it is
alleged here. For Cyprian 9. ep. 1. lib. e.
speaking against an elder which had taken upon him to be executor to one which
was dead / alleges this place. To these reasons of the admonition / may be
added that which the admonition has in the. 230. page / that the regiment of
the church is spiritual / and respects the conscience / and therefore has
not to do with civil offices / which respect properly the common wealth / and
the outward godly honest / and quiet behauior. And therefore their meaning is *
that as the civil governor does use such kind of punishment as may bridle the
outward man / and hold him / that he dare not offend in the open breach of
that godlynes / honesty and quietness which Saint Paul commends unto us: so
the Ecclesiastical regyment 1. Tim. 2. 2.
does use that kind of dysciplyne / whereby the consience and inward man may
be kept in that willing obedyence unto Gods commandment touching a godly
honest and quiet life. And to note the distinction of these regymentes cyuill
and spiritual / the place unto the Thessalonyans is well alleged: 1. These. 5.
12.
for by the words (such as rule over you in the Lord) the Apostle does put
a difference beetweene the cyuill and ecclesiastical regymente. For albeit
that godly cyuill magistrates do rule over us in the Lord / yet Saint Paul
catexochen that is / by excellencye / ascrybeth that unto the Ecclesiastical
gouernoures / because that whereas the cyuill magistrate beside his care for
the salvation of the souls of his people / is occupied in procuring also the
wealth and quyetnes of this life: the Ecclesiastical governors have all their
whole care set upon that only * which perteyneth to the life to come. And to
this end also is alleged by the admonition / the place of Tim. wherein the
apostle teaches part of the ecclesiastical dysciplyne which the mynister may
use / to consist in reprehensions and rebukes / which must be tempered
according as the estate and age of every one does require. Their meaning is not
(as M. Doctor untruly surmyseth) to shut out the cyuill magistrate / or to
debar him of punishing the wicked / but that it appertains not unto the
mynisters to deal that ways / whose correction of faults lies partly in
reprehensions and admonitions / which he speaks of there / partly in
excommunication / whereof is spoken before. Further touching the place of the
Ephesians / for so much as our savior Christ as he is head of his church / is
the spiritual governor thereof / it is meet that their government which are
appointed underneath him / as he is head / should be likewise spiritual / as
his is. For as for the cyuill magistrate / although he be appointed of Christ
(as he is God) in which respect there is none above Christ / yet he is not
appointed of him / in respect that he is head of the church / in regard whereof
/ God is above Christ / and as the apostle says / the head of him. 1. Cor.
11. 3.


Now that I have showed that the places quoted by the admonition / are for ye
most part to the purpose of that they be quoted for / I will add a reason or
two to this purpose / before I come to answer to those reasons which are
brought by M. Doctor. Here I must desire the reader to remember (which I said
before / when I spoke against non residencie) the multitude and difficulty of
those things which are required of the mynister of the word of God. And with
all I will leave to the consyderation of every one / the great infirmity and
weakness which is in men / both the which consyderations set together / it will
easily appear how unmeet a thing it is / that the mynister should have any
other charge laid upon him / seeing that it being so wayghty an office / as
will require all the gifts he has / be they never so great / it must needs
fall out / that so much as he does in an other calling / so much he leaves
undone in this. And what the hand of man is able to reach herein / it is to be
considered in the apostles / whom if the office of the mynistery did so wholly
occupy and set a work / that they could admyt no other charge with it / yea /
and were feign to cast of that which they had / it is clear that none of those
which live now / can beside that function / admytte any other publyke calling.
The story is known in the Acts / that the apostles even during 6. Acts. 2.
the time that they kept together at Jerusalem / and taught the church there /
were feign / that they might the better attend unto preaching and praying / (by
which two things S. Luke summarely sets forth the office of the mynistery)
to give over the charge of providing for the poor unto others / because they
were not hable to do both. Now for so much as the Apostles endued with such
gifts as none have been since / or shall be hereafter / could not discharge
together with the office of the mynister that also of the deacon / how should
any man be found / that together with that office / can discharge the office
of a civil magistrate? And if the Apostles would not have the office of a
Deacon / which was ecclesiastical / and therefore of the same kind with the
mynistery joined unto it / how much less will they suffer that the mynistery
should be joined with a civil office / and therefore of an other kind? For
reason teaches that there is an easyer mingling of those which are of one kind
/ then of those which are of diverse kinds. Again / how can we justly reprove
the papists for the use of both the swords / spiritual / and material /
when as we are found in the same fault our selves? And surely howsoever long
custom has caused it to seem / yet in deed it is a very great and
intolerable confusion / which may be the easelyer understood / if so be we
set before our eyes / how uncomely and disordered it is / in the like / or
rather in the very same case. For let us imagine the Mayor or Baylife of a
town / or the King or Emperor of the land / to come into the pulpet / and
make a sermon / afterward to mynister the Sacraments / and from the Church to
go with the scepter in his hand unto the place of judgment: who would not be
amassed to see this / and wonder at it / as at a strange and monstrous sight?
assuredly the self same deformity it is / when as the Mynister of the word /
is made a Justice of peace / of Quorum / a Commyssioner / an Earl / or any
such like / to whom the judgment of matters pertaining to the court of the
civil Magistrate is committed: especially seeing there are (God be praised) of
the Nobility and gentry of the realm / that are able to discharge these
offices much better / then these Ecclesiastical persons to whom they are
committed. And if so be that there fall out any question at any time which is
to be decided by the word of God / and wherein the advice of the mynister is
needful / there the mynisters help / may / and ought to be required. For
thereof we have not only an example in Esra / where the Princes in a matter of
difficulty / came and asked the counsel of Esra / but we have a plain Esra.
9. 1. De. 19. 17. 18.
commandment in Moses by the Lord* who commanded that the cause of pertury
should be heard before the Lord in the sanctuary / at the hearing whereof the
high priest should be present / by which commandment the Lord does not (by
bringing this cause into the sanctuary) declare / that the judgment thereof did
appertain unto the Ecclesiastical court / but because it being a matter which
touched the glory of God very expressly / he would have the Princes which were
judges there / to be the nearer touched / and the depelyer affected with the
glory of God / whereof they saw the sacrament before their eyes. Neither is the
high priest commanded to be present to this end / that he should sit as
judge of that matter / but that he might dissolve the difficulties / if any
rose of the understanding of the law / and that he might prick forward and
styre up by admonition / the Princes to whom the judgment appertayned / if so
be he should see them cold and slack to revenge the injury done unto the
Lord. Which thing may the better appear / in yt the handling of the matter /
is there appointed not unto the priests / but unto the judges or princes only
/ and so likewise of matrimony and divorce / although the judgment thereof
appertain unto the civil magistrate / yet the minister if there be any
difficulty in knowing when it is a lawful contract / and when the dyuorse is
lawful / may and ought to be consulted with. Thus may the common wealth and
church enjoy both the wisdom and learning which is in the mynister / and
things may be done in that order which God has appointed / without such
confounding and iombling of offices and jurisdictions together. For although
Aristotle's obeliscolychnion, and Platoes dorydrepanon, that is / instruments
serving to two purposes / be lawful in offices of the common wealth / where
things are more free / and left in greater liberty to be ordered at the
judgment and advise of men / especially consydering that upon the diuersitye
of the forms of common wealths / variety of regiment may spring: yet in the
church of God where things are brought to a strayghter rule / and which is but
one and uniform / the same may not be suffered. And yet even those common
wealth Philosophers which do license upon occasion that two offices may meet
in one man / hold that it is best and conuenientest / that every one should
have a particulare charge. For Aristotle says that it is most agreeable to
nature / that hen should be pros hen, that is / one instrument to one use. And
Plato uses the Not Hercules himself against two.
proverb mede heracleis pros duo, against those which will take upon them
diverse vocations / and not content them selves with one / so that they make the
meting of many functions in one man / to be a remedy only in extreme need and
poverty of able men. And although both be unlawful / yet as the case stands
in our realm / it is more tellerable that the civil magistrate should do the
office of a minister / then that the minister should intermeddle with the
function of the magistrate. For when the accountes shall be cast / it will fall
out / that there are more sufficient and able men to serve in the common wealth
of this realm / then in the church / and greater want in the one then in the
other. And if beside this / both authority of the werd of God and light of
reason / we will look unto the practice of the church many years after the
time of the Apostles / we shall find that the church has been very careful
from time to time / that this order should be kept / that the ministers should
not entangle them selves with any thing beside their ministry / and those
things which the word of God does necessaryly put upon them / le^st the
strength of their mind and of their body / being distracted unto many things
/ they should be the less able to accomplish their ministry unto the full.
Which may also partly appear by that which I have alleged out of Cyprian /
which will not permit them so much as to be executors of a Testament. And in
one of the Canons which are ascribed unto the Apostles it is enjoined that
they Can. Apofl. 80.
should not entangle them selves with worldly offices / but attend upon their
Ecclesiastical affairs.

Further / in the council of Calcedon it was decreed / that none of the Tom.
2. con. Calced. can. 3.
clearkes or clergy (as it terms them) should receive any charge of those
which are under age / unless they were such as the laws did necessarily cast
upon him / which it calls inexcusable charges / meaning by all lykelyhoode /
the wardshyp of his brothers children or some such thing. Where is also
declared the cause of that decree to have been / for that there were certain
mynisters which were stewardes to noble men. And in the. 7. canon of the same
council it is decreed / that none of the clergy should either go to warfare
as souldyers or captains / or should receive any secular honors / and if they
did / they should be excommunicated or accursed. Now I come to M. Doctors
arguments / which he brings to establish this disorder.

And first he says mynisters of the word may not occupy them selves in wordly
business / as to be merchants / husbandmen / crafts men / and such like / but
they may exercise cyuill offices. Where first of all I perceive M. Doctor is of
this mind / that the order of God is not to be broken for small gain / or
when a man must take great toil of the body to break it: but it may be broken
with getting of honor / and doing of those things which may be done with out
soil / and with great commendation / there it is lawful to break it. In
deed so the Poet (but in the person of an unjust and ambition man /) said: ei
chre adicein, tyrannidos heneca chre, that is. If a man must do unjustly / he
must do it to bear rule.

Secondarely I do see that M. Doctor will not be shackled and hyndered from
his ministry by a pair of iron fetters / but if he can get a pair of golden
fetters / he is contented to be hampered and entangled / from doing the office
of ministry committed unto him. For onles these should be the causes which
should move him to take the one / and refuse the other / verily I see none. For
where as he says it is a help / and maynteineth relygion / in deed that is
the reason of the papists which M. Calvin confuteth in his institution. And
although it be good 4. li. cap. 11.
and necessary to punish vice and iniquity / by corporal punishments and by
cyuill corrections: yet it does no more follow that that should be done by ye
mynisters / then it follows that for that preaching and mynistring the
sacraments and excommunication are good and necessary / therefore the same is
fit to be executed by the cyuill magistrate. I grant the mynisters have also
to punyshe vice / for as the cyuill magistrates punish lyghter faults with
some penalty of money or loss of membre: so the church and the mynister
especially with the church / has to punish faults by represions and rebukes.
And as the cyuill magistrate punishes greater faults by death: so the
mynister with other which have intereste / has with the sword of
excommunication power to kill those which be rebellious / and to cut them from
the church / as the other does from the common wealth. And if it be a help to
the mynisters office / that he should meddle with civil punishments / why
should it not be a help unto the magistrates office / that he should
excommunicate and other things pertaining to the ecclesiastical disciplyne?
And where as M. Doctor says they may not be husbandmen / crafts me^. etc. and
yet may have civil offices / I think far otherwise / that although neither be
lawful / yet the one were more tolerable then the other. For seeing after the
ministry of the word / there is no calling under the sun weightyer / and
which requires greater exercise of the mind / then the office of the
magistrate / it is against all reason to lay this heavy burden upon a man that
is already laden / and has as much as he is able to bear. It were more equal
/ if they will needs add unto the weight of this burden / to lay some
lyghter charge of exercising and handy craft / then to break his back with
the charge of a cyuill magistrate.

And whereas in the policy of M. Doctor it seems a furtherance to the gospel
to join these together which was also the policy of the Idolaters / (as I
have before declared) in the wisdom of God it has seemed far otherwise /
which I doubt not did therefore separate the ministry from this pomp / which
is commendable in the cyuill magistrate / least the efficacy and power of the
simplicity of the word of God and of the mynistery should be obscured /
whilst men would attribute the conversion of souls unto the gospel (dew unto
the word and to the spirit of God) to these glorious shows. And least
whylest the mynyster have the word in one hand / and the sword in the other
/ men should not be able to judge so well in their consciences of the mighty
operation of the word of God in them. For they might doubt with them selves /
whether the fear and out ward show of the mynister / carried some stroke with
them in believing the word.

But M. Doctor says / that cyuill offices are not to be counted worldly
affairs / but heavenly and spiritual / it is so / and yet when they are
compared with the ecclesiastical offices / they may be called secular offices
/ for so much as they together with the care of relygion / procure and provide
for the things whereby we may quietly and commodiously live here / where the
ecclesiastical offices are immediately and only bent / to procure the glory of
God and the salvation of men / and in that signification of heavenly and
spiritual which you take / marchandyse / husbandry / and the handy craft be
heavenly and spyrituall / although not in the same degree. All lawful
callinges came from God / and return to him again / that is / he is both
author of them / and they ought to be referred to his glory / so that if the
mynister may exercise all things which be heavenly / and spiritual / you may
as well bring him down to the plough / as promote him to the court. And
whereas M. Doctor says that the office of a commissyoner is ecclesiastical /
because it handles ecclesiastical causes / I marvel that he is so ignorant
/ that he can not put a difference between giving iudyciall sentences / and
appoynting bodily punishments (which are mere cyuill) and between the
understanding the truth of every such cause according as the word of God
defyneth of it: which is a thing common as well unto the magistrate as unto the
minister / and wherein the mynister because he ought to be most ready / ought
(if need be) consulted with.

An other of Master Doctors reasons is / that as kings do serve Christ by
making laws for him / so bishops do serve Christ by executing laws for
him. As though it pertayned not unto the magistrates to execute laws / as well
as to make them / and as if the magistrate were not therefore called a speaking
law / because by executing them / he does cause the laws after a fashion to
speak. This is to divide the stake of the magistrate / between him / and the
bishop / yea to give the bishop the best part of it. For we know that with
us / the people be at making of the laws / which may not meddle with the
execution of them. And if M. Doctor say that he means not hereby to shut the
prince from executing the laws / then as his similytude (when it is at the
best) proves nothing: so by this means it haltes down right / and is no
simylitude. As for Elie and Samuel they are extraordinary examples / which may
thereby appear / for that both these offices first meting in Melchisedech /
and afterward in Moses / were by the commandment of God severed / when as the
Lord took from Moses (being so wise and godly a man) the priesthode / and gave
it to Aaron / and to his successors. And so / for so much as when the Lord
would polishe his church / and make it famous / and renoumed in the world / he
gave this order: It appears that he would have this to be a perpetual rule
unto his church. And by so much it is the clearer / for that ye Lord did not
tarry until Moses death / but took the priesthode away from Moses / which was a
man as able to execute both / as either Elie / or Samuel. And this may be also
easily seen / for that in a manner always / where there was any good and
stayed estate of the church / these offices were mynistred by several persons
/ and then met and were mingled / when the estates were very ruinous and
miserable. And if this be a good reason to prove that mynisters may exercise
civil offices / it is as good a reason to prove / that princes may preach /
and mynister the sacraments. For if the mynisters may exercise civil offices
/ because Elie / and Samuel (being mynisters) did so: the Princes / and Judges
may preach the word / and mynister the sacraments / because Elie and Samuel
(being princes and judges) did so. And so we see / how M. Doctor going about /
to defend one confusion / brings in an other.

As for Elias killing the false prophets / and our savior Christ's whipping
out of the temple / it is strange that Master Doctor will allege them / as
things to be followed / when he may as well teach / that we may call for fire
from heaven / as Elias did / and being demanded / answer nothing / as our
savior did: as to follow these actions which are most singular / and
extraordinary. And if these one / or two examples be enough to break the order
that God has set / by this a man may prove / that the mynisters may be fyshers
/ and tent makers / because Ioh. 21. 3. Act. 18. 3.
Peter / and Paul (being mynisters) did fyshe and make tents. And truly these
are not so extraordinary / and from the general rule / as the other be. And it
was permitted in a council / that rather then a mynister should have two
benefices Tom. 3. council. Nice. ca. 15.
/ he might labor with his hands / to supply his want withal. When S. Paul
willed Tim. that he should not receive an accusation against an elder / under
two or three witnesses / he did commit nothing les / then any civil office
unto him. And M. Doctor him self has alleged it before / as a thing incident
to the office of a bishop: and therefore he does forget himself maruellously
now / that makes this a civil office.

And does M. Doctor think / that S. Paul made magistrates? Or is he of that
judgment / that the church in the time of persecution / may make civil
officers? But it is true / that he that is once over the shoes / sticks not
to run over his boots.

And last of all to prove that bishops may have prisons / he cites Peter
which punyshed Ananias / and Saphira with death. M. Doctor must understand that
this was Ecclesiastical power / and was done by virtue of that function /
which S. Paul calls dynamin, which is one of those functions that the 1.
Cor. 12. 28.
Lord placed in his church for a time. But is this a good argument / because S.
Peter punished with the word / therefore the mynister may punyshe with the
sword? And because S. Peter did so once / therefore the bishop may do so
always? and because S. Peter did that / which appertains to no civil
magistrate / and which no civil magistrate / by any means may / or can do /
therefore the mynister may do that / which appertains unto the civil
magistrate? For if there had been a civil magistrate / the same could not have
punyshed this fault of dissimulation / which was not known / nor declared it
self by any outward action. So that if this example prove any thing / it
proves that the mynister may do / that no man may do / but the Lord only /
which is to punysh faults that are hyd / and unknown. If this be ignorance /
it is very gross / and if it be against knowledge / it is more dangerous. I
have determined with my self / to leave unto M. Doctor his outcries and
declamations / and if I should have used them / as often as he gives occasion
/ there would be no end of writing. The Lord give M. Doctor either better
knowledge / or better conscience.

Unto M. Doctor / asking where it appears that pope Eugenius brought in
prysons into the church / as also unto three or four such like demands which
he makes in this book / the authors of the Admonition answer at once /
that this and the other are sound in Pantaleon and M. Bales Chronicles. Here
I will take in that / which the bishop of Salesbury has in the last page of
his half sheet touching this matter.

And first of all I well agree / that he says / that to give unto satan (which
is to excommunicate / and to correct an Ecclesiastical person by reprehensyon
/ or putting him out of the ministerye / if the case so require) is mere
ecclesiastical / and not civil / and that those things ought to be done of
the officers of ye church. This only I deny / that the ministers ought to
meddle with civil offices. For proof whereof / the B. alleges the example
of Augustine / which as Possidonius writes / was troubled with the hearing and
determinyng of causes. Wherein Possidonius says nothing / but that I willingly
agree unto. For the minister with the elders / ought both to hear / and
determine of causes / but of such causes / as pertain unto their knowledge /
whereof I have spoken before. And that Possidonius meant such causes as belonged
unto Augustine / as he was a minister / and not of civil affairs / it
appears by that which he writes immediately after / where he says. Being
also consulted of / by certain in their worldly affairs / he wrote epistles to
diverse / but he accounted of this / as of compulsyon / and restraint from his
better busynesses: whereby it appears / that S. Augustine meddled not with
those worldly affairs / further / then by way of giving counsel / which is
not unlawful for a minister to do / as one friend unto an other / so that his
mynisterye be not thereby hindered. And for the truth of this matter / that
ministers ought not to meddle with civil affairs / I will appeal to no other
/ then to the bishop him self / who does affirm plainly the same / that the
The bishop of Sarum / in the defense of the Apollogie / in the. 5. part. 4.
chap. and. 2. section. 1. Pet. 4. 15.
admonition here affirms.

And therefore I conclude / that for so much as both the holy scriptures do
teach / that ministers ought not to meddle with civil offices / and reason /
and the practice of the church do confirm it / that they ought to keep
themselves within the limits of the ministerye / and Ecclesiastical functions
/ least whilst they break forth into the calling of a magistrate / in stead
of showing themselves episcopous, that is overseers / they be found to declare
themselves * allotriopiscopous, that is: busy bodies / meddling in things which
belong not unto them. And thus putting them in remembrance of that which they
know well enoughe / that they ought cosman sparten hen elachon, that is to
say: study to adorn that charge which they take in hand / and do profess /
I leave to speak any further of this matter.

Unto the two next sections I have spoken in that which has been said
touching excommunication / canons / and prebendaries. etc. and unto that which
is contained in the. 226. and. 227. I answer that I can not excuse covetous
patrones of benefices / but covetous parsons and vicars be a great plague unto
this church / and one of the principal causes of rude and ignorant people.

Likewise unto the two next sectio^s I have answered before / in speaking
against the spiritual courts / which are now used / and unto the next after
that / in speaking of the ordayning of ministers. And unto that which is
contained in the later end of the. 234. and the beginning of the. 235. I say
that the church shall judge of the aptnes or unaptness of our reasons / and
albeit we do find fault with diverse things in the book / yet we neither
oppugn as enemies / nor are by the grace of God either Papists / Anabaptists /
Atheists / or Puretanes / as it pleases M. Doctor to call us. And to the
prayer against disturbers of the church / I say with all my heart. Amen.

Unto the next section I have answered in the treatise of the apparel. And
unto the next after / in the treatise which declares to whom it does
appertain to make ceremonies and orders of the church. And unto the section
contained in the. 243. page / I say that M. Doctor being asked of Oynions /
answeareth of garlike. For the authors of the admonition / desyring that it
might be as lawful for them to publishe by Printe their minds / or to be heard
dispute / or that their mind put in writing / might be openly debated /
master D. answeareth with Augustines sentence (which he has made the foot of
his song) nothing to the purpose of that which they said / the performance of
which promise / we will notwythstanding wait for.

Unto the section contained in the. 245. and. 246. pages.
HEre master Doctor / contrary to the protestation of the authors of the
Admonition / which declare that for the abuses / and corruptions / they dare
not simply subscribe / says / that therefore they will not subscribe / because
they are required by lawful authority. Which how both presumptuous and
uncharitable a judgment it is / let all men judge / especially upon this
matter which has been declared. And where master Doctor would upon the
marginall note / prove that we have good discipline / because we have good
doctrine / and thereupon does wonderfully tryumphe / he plays as he of whom
it is said / meden labon cratei carteros, that is / having gotten nothing /
holds it fast. For can M. doctor be so ignorant / that this manner of speech
(doctrine and discipline can not be severed) is used for that / that they ought
not to be severed? when we say (following S. Paul) that we can do nothing
against the truth / do we not mean that we ought to do nothing / nor can do
nothing lawfully against it? And do not al men know when we say that a man can
not be separated from his wife / but for the cause of adultery / that we mean
he ought not / or he cannot lawfully? Therefore this is / as (all men may see) a
mere cavil / and triumph over his own shadow. There is no brag of suffering
made by the authors of the admonition. The modesty wherewith he has defended
this cause / ca^ not be hidden. That he would have other men punished for well
doing / when he is not content that the open wrongs which he does / should be
once spoken of / I have showed how unreasonable it is.

Finally / as you exhort us to submit our selves to good order / which have been always / and yet are ready to do: to leave to be contentious / which never
yet began: to join with you in preaching the word of God / which have stopped
our mouths / and will not suffer us to preach: so we exhort you in Gods
behalf / and as you will once answer it before the just judge / that you will
not willingly shut your eyes against the truth / that if the Lord vouchsafe to
open it unto you / you kick not against it. Where we pray you to take heed /
that neither the desire of keeping your wealth and honor which you are in / nor
the hope which you may have of any further promotion / nor yet the care of
keeping your estimation / by maintaining that which you have once set down /
nor the sleighty suggestion of crafty and wily papists / do drive you to
stomble against this truth of God / which touches the government of his
church / and the purging of those corruptions which are amongste us / knowing
that you can not stumble upon the word of God / * but forthwith you run your
self against Christ which is the rock. And 1. Pet. 2. 8. Luke. 20. 18.
you know that he will not give back / but breaks all to fytters /
whatsoever he be that rusheth against him. And if the matter herein alleged /
do not satisfy you: then I desire even before the same God / that you confute
it / not by passing over things which you can not answer / or by leaving both
the words and the meaning of the book / and taking your own fansye to confute
/ or by wrangling with the fault of the Printe / or by carping at the
translation / when the words being changed / the sense remains / or by
alleging that such a one / or such an other / was of this or that judgment /
as you for the most part (having nothing but his bare name) have done. (All
which things you have committed in this book) but that you confute it by the
authority of the word of God / by good and sound reasons / wholly and not by
pecemeale. And if you bring the practice of the churches / we desire that it
may be out of authorities which are exta^t / which are not counterfeit / and
which were in the best and purest times. And if you think that the credit of
your doctorship or deanrye / will bear out that which you can not answer your
self / besides that The revenging eye.
ecdicon omma, is never shut / remember M. doctor / that light is come into the
world / and men will not be deluded with nothing / nor abused with visards.
Neither let it embolden you (which peradventure has made you to presume the
more in this book) to write any thing upon hope / that no man dare answer it.
For neither the Queen's majesty / nor her honorable counsel / as we are
persuaded / will deal so sharply with those whom they know to be faithful and
lawful subjects / which pray that all the treasures of Gods wisdom may be
powered upon them: neither have we cause to think / but that as the evil
opinion which is in part conceived of us / has grown upon false and untrue
informations / which you and such other have given (in crying in their ears /
yt we be anabaptists / conspired with papists / puretanes / Donatists /
bringers in of confusion and anarchie / enemies to civil government / and I
know not what) even so when her majesty and their honors shall understand / how
far we are from those wicked opinions / they will leave that opinion of us /
and rather esteem of us by that we have preached / taught / and now write /
then that which other men report of us / being things which we never taught /
spoke / or so much dreamed of.

Unto master Doctors censures upon the additions / detractions / and
alterations of both the parts of the admonition.
Besides that oftentimes M. Doctor does accounte the expositions and
explanations / corrections / he leaves us somewhat the les hope / that he will
correct his errors / for that he pursues the authors of the admonition so
hard / correcting their very small and few slips which they have made / calling
this singular modestye / and commendable humility amongste other reproaches /
dalying and inconstancye / when it is our profession every day to learn
better things. For unto what end should we live / if time / if experience / if
reading / if musing / if conference should teach us nothing? And therefore /
when things are Printed again / it is good and praise worthy / to pollish
those things which are some* what rude / to mitigate those things which are to
sharp / to make plain / and to give light to those things which seem darker
/ and to correct that which is a miss. I think M. Doctor should not be
ignorante / that wise men have their deuteras phrontidas, their second
counsels / and those also wyser and better then their first / as that sentence
does declare. I will therefore say no more hereof / but admonish M. Doctor
that he receive more lovingly those which correct them selves / seeing that the
best defense to his book must be / not a correction here and there / but a
clean blotting and striking out / not an amending / but a new making almost
of his whole book. Other matter in his censures / he has almost none at all
worth the answearing / saving that he has a place or two which touch the
matters before entreated of. For whereas he accuses the authors of the
admonition in the first leaf / as though they should condemn Doctors and
bachellers of divinity / and so bring in confusion of degrees / he upon the.
5. leaf / confesses that they allow of a Doctor. Although he that takes
away degrees of Doctor or Bachelor of Divinity / does not bring in confusion
/ nor takes not away all degrees of schools / especially seeing they are now
made bare names without any offices / and oftentimes they are admitted to these
degrees / which neither can / nor will teach.

Unto the second leaf of the addition of the second part of the admonition /
master D. says / that because the third to Titus makes not against reading /
therefore it makes not against reading ministers / that is / ministers that can
do nothing but read.

And whereas he would pick out a contradiction in the words of the admonition /
because they say bare reading / is but bare feading / the discord is in his
cares / not in their words. For when they said it was no feading / they meant
such feeding as could save them / and so in calling it bare feading / they
note that there is not enough in that / to keep them from famishment. And in
deed / unless the Lord work miraculously and extraordinarily (which is not to
beloked for of us) the bare reading of the scriptures without the preaching /
can not deliver so much as one poor sheep from destruction / and from the
wolf. And if some have been converted wonderfully / yet M. doctor should
remember that potamos ouc aei axinas pherei, that is. The water does not always
bear iron.

And upon the third leaf / where he gives instance in the Apocalypse of the
word (priest) to be taken otherwise / then for the Leuiticall priesthode / and
priesthode of our savior Christ. Master D. can not be ignorant / that the
admonition speaks of those which be priests in deed / and properly / and not
by those which are priests by a Metaphore and borrowed speech. And whereas he
desires to learn where the word (priest) is taken in evil part in all the
new Testament. Although all men see how he asks this question of no mind to
learn: yet if he will learn (as he says) he shall find that in the acts
of the apostles / it is taken diverse tunes in evil part. For seeing that the
office and function of ron iereon, that is / of priests / was (after our sauyor
Christ's ascencion) naught and ungodly: The name whereby they were called /
which did exercise that ungodly function / can not be otherwise taken / then in
the evil part.

M. Doctor upon the. 5. leaf / cites M. Caluins authority / to prove that the
laying on of the hands upon young children / and the Confirmation which is
here used / is good. In the which place / although he allow of a kind of
Confirmation / yet he does not commend that which we have. For he does
plainly reprove Ierom / for saying that it came from the apostles / which
notwythstanding the Confirmation with us does affirm. Besides that / there
are other abuses which I have noted there / which M. Calvin does not by any
word allow. He allows in deed of a putting on of hands of the children /
when they come out of their childehode / or begin to be young men / but as well
as he does allow of it / he was one of those which did thruste it out of the
church / where he was pastor. And so he allows of it / that he brings (in
the sixth section of the same chapter) a strong reason to abolyshe it. Where he
asks / what the imposition of hands should do now / seeing that the giving
of the gifts of the holy ghost by that ceremony is ceased. Therefore / seeing
that we have M. Caluins reason against this imposition of hands / his name
ought not to be prejudicial unto us: especially / seeing that we have
experience of great inconuenyences which come by it / which M. Calvin could
not have / that thing being not in use in that church where he lived. Which
inconvenience in things which are not necessary / ought to be a just cause of
abolishing of them. And this is not my judgment only / but the judgment of
the churches of Heluetia / Berne / Tigurine / Geneua / Scotland / and diverse
others / as appears in the. 19. chapter of their confession.

Upon the. 6. leaf / M. Doctor says that the Pope takes the sword from
Princes / but our bishops take it at their hands / and given of them: as
though challenge were not made against the Pope / for using the material
sword / and not only for using it against the will of ye princes. For by that
reason / if Princes would put their swords in his hand / as sometimes they
have done / he might lawfully use them. And whereas he says / that our church
men meddle not with all civil causes / or exercise all civil jurisdiction /
but such as helps to discipline / and the good government of the church /
and the state: What says he / that is not truly said of any civil magistrate
in the realm? for no one does meddle in all causes. And further / I would
gladly know what civil jurisdiction is in this realm / which helps not
unto the good government of this church / and state. For if they meddle with
all that / there is none which they have not to do with.

Upon the. 7. leaf / he says / that he knows not the meaning of the
admonition / when it proves that the government of the church is spiritual /
their meaning is plain enoughe / and I have declared it more at large to be /
not only that our sauyor Christ rules by his spirit in the hearts of his
elect (besides which government M. doctor seems to know none.) But that there
is also spiritual government / which is in the whole church visible / and to be
seen / exercised by those / whom God has appointed in his stead / called
spiritual / because where as the civil government uses the sword / this
uses the word: and where the civil governor addresseth himself unto the
body / and has that for special matter to work on / the spiritual
governors be occupied in reforming the mind / and subduing that with those
punishments and corrections / which God has appointed for that purpose. Which
signification of spiritual government / M. Calvin does speak of in both the
places alleged by M. doctor: and especially in the later / unto whom the
admonition sent the reader / not thereby to give more weight unto the truth /
but that he might have there a plainer / and fuller understanding of that which
it meant / and could not for that breuity and shortness which it follows
throughout / utter at large. Whereby it is manifest / that the admonition is so
far from shutting out either civil government / or external government in
the church / that it teaches of an external government which M. doctor seems
not to have heard of / allbeit there be nothing either more common in the
scryptures / or Ecclesiastical writers.

Upon the. 8. leaf / M. doctor says he sees nothing / how the place of the
Ephesians makes any thing against this manner of speech of the bishop (receive
the holy ghost) and yet it makes thus much / that for as much as the apostles
did use to pray that the grace of God might be given unto men / the bishops
should not use this manner of speech / which contains the form of a
commandment.

Upon the. 9. leaf he has sundry grievous accusations and charges of disorder
/ disobedience / and contempt against those which refuse the apparel / and
labors to persuade that they are great and weighty matters. But his profes
were spent before.

As for answer to the articles collected out of the admonition / it is made
in the Reply unto M. Doctors book / where I have showed how the admonition is
misconstrued / and taken otherwise / then either it means or speaks /
whereunto I will refer the reader.

And albeit I have showed how untrue it is / that the admonition affirms that
there is no church in England / yet I can not pas by the secret philosophy
whereby M. doctor would prove / that the authors of the admonition affirm it.
For says he by ye rule of Philosophy. Quod vix fit, non fit, that which is
skarce done / is not done. I say this is secret / for it was never taught /
neither in Academia, nor in Stoa, nor Lyceo. I have red Quod fere fit, non fit,
that which is almost done / is not done. But I never remember any such rule /
as M. Doctor speaks of.

And besides that in our tongue / those things which (...) said to be skarce /
are notwythstanding oftentimes supposed to be: As when a ^an says that there
is skarce a man alive. etc. the scripture also uses that phrase of speech /
of things which are / as when it says / the just man shall skarce be saved / it
does not mean 1. Pet. 4. 18.
that just men shall not be saved. The rest of that I have answered.

And whereas he says that it is all one / to say that the election of the
minister must be made by the church / and to say / it must be made by the
people: It is a great ouersyghte to make the part / and whole all one / seeing
the people be but one part of the church / and the minister and the other
gouernoures are / allbeit not the greatest / yet the principallest part. I
grant that sometimes a part is taken for the whole / and so we do call
sometimes the governors of the church the church / and sometimes the people.
But where the question is of the proprietye of these speeches (the church and
the people) there all men that have any judgment / can easily put a
difference. The rest of those articles are answered in the discourse of the
book. Besides that / the faults which are found with the untrue gathering of
them / are not taken away by M. Doctor / but only in confident and bold
asseuerations. And if I should say any thing / I should but repeat their
words.

In the view of the second admonition / M. Doctor does as it seems of
purpose / cull out those things which he has spoken on before / and in
repeatyng of them / refers his reader unto his book. Diverse other matters
there are / of great weight / which he speaks not of / if he do approve them
/ it had been well he had signified his liking: if he do not / that he had
confuted them. And if he travailed so heauely of brynging forth of this book /
that it was as heavy a burden unto him / as Solomon says a fond word is unto
an unwise man: he might have taken day to answer it. Now by this slender
answearing of it / or rather not answearing at all / but only asking how this
and that is proved / (where as being proved / it is unreproved of him) he does
his cause more harm / then he is aware of. For unless his proufes be joined
with his expulsions / imprisonments / and with all that racket which he makes
in Cambridge to the uttermost of that his authority will stretch unto / he may
be well assured / that their driving out / will draw in the truth / and their
imprisonment / will set the truth at greater liberty / and thereby prove it
self to be neither Papistry / nor Anabaptistry / Donatistry / Catharisme / nor
any other heresy which are by due correction repressed. But as for the truth
of God / the more it is laden / the straighter it stands / and ye more it is
kept under / the more it enforces it self to rise / and will undoubtedly
get up / how great so ever the stone be / which is laid upon it. And albeit
he had no leisure to answer the matters which required his answer / yet he
carpeth at by matters / and asks who are meant by the politic Macheuils.

What if they mean master doctor / and such other / which under the pretense
of policy / would overthrow the church / and that by those things which have
skarce a show of policy / and in deed ouerturne the policy and government
of the Lord. And I pray you tell me M. doctor who be those superyors / which do
contemn / hate / discourage / and frumpe those which execute the laws of the
realm / of the which you speak in the. 88. page. And where you add by and by
/ that they envy all men of great authority / wit / and policy / I have
answered this speech before. And truly I think there is not in Meshecke /
so slanderous Psalm. 120. 4. 5
a tongue to be found as this is / nor the Juniper coals are not comparable
with it. After he accuses the admonition / as if it condemned schools and
universities with all manner degrees / when it does but inueigh against degrees
given of custom / rather then of right / rather by money / then by merit of
learning / and when titles of doctorshyp be given to those which have not the
office of a Doctor / and oftentimes to those which can not do the office if
they had it / and when men do seek vain glory in them / and such like.

For the repetition of Gloria patri. etc. I have spoken sufficiently before:
but what spirit is it / that calls this translation of the word
battologefete, (use not vain repetitions) a wicked wresting of S. Mathewes
place in his.vj. chapter. What rasor is this / that cutteth so sharp? knows
he against whom / and against the excellent learning / and singular piety of
how many he speaks? For this is the translation of those learned / and
godly men / which translated the Bible / which is commonly called the Geneua
Bible: and is this a wicked wresting? Admit it were not translated exactly / to
the word of the Evangelist: is it therefore a wresting / and a wicked wresting?
What (I will not say wicked / but) false conclusion / or doctrine can be
grounded of this translation? And they that translate it thus / have not only
the authority of ye Lexicons to confirm their translation / which show that
this word was taken up / in reproach of a folysh Pocte called Battus, which
used to repeat one thing many times: but they have also the circumstance of the
place to warrant it. For the reason which our savior Christ uses / to draw men
from this fault leads to this translation / and can not stand with that sense
/ which M. doctor sets down. For how ha^g these together: you shall not
babble many words without faith. etc. because your heavenly father knows /
what you have need of / before you ask? It is unlike first / that our sauyor
Christ would speak thus (babble not many words without faith. etc.) when as
rather he would have forbidden them to speak any one word without faith. etc.
For if he should speak thus / he should seem to have allowed a prayer without
faith / so that it were not conceived in many words. And again / if (as M.
doctor says) this had been the proposition / which our sauyor Christ dissuaded
from / y^ they should not babble many words without faith. etc. he would never
have added this reason / (for your heavenly father knows. etc.) for neither
is he father unto any such: And he would rather have said as S. James says /
that they Chap. 1. 7.
should be sure to receive nothing / because they ask not in faith. Now as
this reason can not stand with M. Doctors interpretation: so does it well agree
with the translation of the Geneua Bible. For what could be more fitly said to
drive the disciples from this vain repetition / then to say / that the heavenly
father knows. etc. and that it is not with the Lord / as it is with men /
that must have a thing oftentimes spoken / or ever they can understand it?
Furthermore / what a reason is this: We must repeat the Lords prayer
oftentimes / therefore we must repeat it oftentimes in half an hour / and one
in the neck of an other? And if s. Paul's place to the Thessalonians / (pray
continually) be referred unto the saying of the Lords prayer (as M. doctor
would bear us in hand) then it is not lawful for us to use any other words /
then those which our sauyor Christ used. But I could never yet learn / that
those words bind us of necessity / any more unto the repetition of the Lords
prayer word for word / then unto the repetition of any other godly prayer in
the scripture. And I would be loathe to say that it were simply necessary / to
use that just nombre of words / and neither more / nor les at any time / much
les oftentimes in so small a space. For our sauyor Christ does not there give
a prescript form of prayer / whereunto he binds us: but gives us a rule and
squire to frame all our prayers by / as I have before declared. I know it is
necessary to pray / and to pray often. I know also that in so few words it is
impossible for any man to frame so pithy a prayer: And I confess that the
church does well in concluding their prayers with the Lords prayer: but I
stand upon this / that there is no necessitye laid upon us / to use these
very words and no more / and especially that the place of S. Paul to the
Thessalonians does least of all prove it. As for M. Doctors outcryes / he
has so often worn our ears with them / and that without cause / that I
think by this time / no man regards them.

A short Reply unto M. Doctors brief answer / which he makes to certain
godly Admonitions and Exhortations / which he calls pamphletes.
Where the says the authors of the admonition are not punyshed / or their
book misliked / for that it tells of the faults in the church / or of ye
sins of men / but for yt it maintains false doctrine / and for that they
preferred a libell: For the doctrine / it appears by that which is said /
what it is. And if he would define what a libell were / it were easy to answer
unto the other point. If he mean because it was preferred without any name
unto it / how will he answer unto the example of the writer of the Epistle
unto the Hebrews / which was a singular instrument / and did not subscribe his
Epistle / wherein notwithstanding / he sharply rebukes diverse faults amongst
them. And yet the writer to the Hebrews / was not the minister of Satan. And
if he call it a libel / because it uses some sharper speeches / surely all men
see that his book deserves then to be called a Satyr / having for tarte
words / bitter / and for one / twenty. But in what respect so ever he call
it a libell / he accuses not so much the authors of the admonition for
preferring of it / as diverse of the honorable house of Parliament / which did
allow it. Where as master Doctor compares us with the Phariseis / and says
we do all to be seen of men / and that we hold down our heads in the
streates / and strain at a gnatte / swalowing down a Camel / because they
are in all men's knowledge / I will leave it to them to judge of the truth of
those things. Where he says we seldom / or never laughe / it is not
therefore that we think that it is not lawful to laughe / but that the
considerations of the calamities of other churches / and of the ruins of ours
/ with the heavy judgments of the Lord which hang over us / ought to turn
our laughing into weeping / besides that a man may laugh / although he show
not his tethe. And so Jerome in effect / answeareth in an epistle which he
wrote / where upon occasion that certain used the same accusation / that M.
doctor does / he says / because we do not laugh with open mouth / therefore
we are counted sad.

And where he says / we separate our selves from all congregations / and are
enemies to Prince / and that we would seem to be holyer then other / these and
such like slanders are answered before. And if there be any that refuse to
salute godly preachers / or spitte in any man's face / or wish the plague of
God to light upon them / or say that they be damned / we defend not / nor
allow of any such behauyor. And it is unreasonable / that the fault of one /
should be imputed to so many / and to those which do as much mislyke of it / as
M. doctor himself. And what needed. M. Doctor to bid the authors of these
exhortations to hold their hands? where do they in a word / offer to strike?
belike his tongue is his own / and therefore he speaks whatsoever he lysteth.

After M. Doctor confuteth his own shadow. For the exhortation does not
require that the name of a brother should deliver the authors of the admonition
from punishment if they deserved it / but desires that it might work some
moderation of the rigor of it / and compassion to minister to their
necessities in prison. He says that the authors of the Admonition / take not
them for their brethren / yes verily / although unbrotherly handled / and for
fathers to / and so both love them / and reverence them / until (which we hope
will not be) they shall manifestly for the upholding of their own kingdom and
profit / refuse to have Christ reign over us / in whom this fatherhoods and
brotherhoode does consiste.

I know not whether they have been conferred with or no / but I think the
first reason which they had to persuade them / was / that they should go to
Newgate / which is that / which the Exhortation complains of after / that
they are first punished / before they be taught. And in this behalf M. doctor
has no cause to complain as he does. For if he list / he may learn or ever he
go to prison. And as for the truth of the cause / and wresting and mangling of
the scriptures / in most places where they are said to mangle and wrest / and
how he has answered the request of the exhortation / which is: to confute the
admonition by the scriptures / and how truly / aptly / and learnedly M. doctor
has behaved himself / in citing of the old Councels / and Fathers: I leave it
to be esteemed / partly / of that which I have said / and partly / by the deeper
consideration of those / which because they can better judge / may see further
into M. Doctors faults / and rapsodies then I can. Although the truth is /
that I have / because I would not make a long book / by heaping of one
reprehension upon an other / contented my self rather to trip / as it were /
and to pass over with a light foot / the Heads / and Sums of things / then
to number the faults which are almost / as many as there are sentences in this
book / more I am sure then there are pages.

ACcording to my promise made in my book / I have here set down the judgment
of the later writers / concerning these matters in controversy between us.
Wherein because I love not to translate out of other men's works / whereby I
might make mine to grow: I have kept this moderation / that I neither set
down all the writers / nor all their places / that I could / nor yet of every
singular matter: but the chefest writers / and other of the cheifest points /
or else of those / wherein they are alleged against us by M. Doctor / and one
only place of each (as far as I could judge and choose out) most direct to
that wherefore I have alleged it. For otherwise if I would have spoken of all
the points / and of the judgment of all the writers / and gathered all the
places that I could / they would have been sufficient matter of an other book
as big / or rather bigger then this. I must also admonish the Reader / that I
have for borne in certain of these Titles / to set down the judgments of M.
Beza / M. Bullinger and M. Gualter: because they are comprehended in the
Confession of the Churches. And thus / partly upon those sentences which I have
alleged in this book / and partly upon these Testimonies here set down: I
leave to the consyderation of all men / how truly / and justly it is said /
that the learned writers of these times (one or two only excepted) are against
us.

1 That there ought now to be the same regiment of the Church / which was in
the Apostles time.
THe confession of the Heluetian / Tygurin / Berne / Geneua / Polonia / Hungary
/ and Scotland with others / in the. 18. chapter / speaking of the equality of
the ministers says / that no man may justly forbid to return to the old
constitution of the church of God / and to receive it before the custom of man.

M. Calvin in his Institututions. 4. book. 3. chapter / and 8. section /
speaking of the auncientes which did assist the pastor in every church / says
that experience teaches / that that order was not for one age / and that this
office of government is necessary to all ages. And in the. 12. chapter / and
first section of the same book says as much of Excommunication and other
Ecclesiastical censures.

Peter Martyr upon the third to the Romans teaches that although the common
wealth change her government / yet the church always keeps hers still.

Bucer in his first book of the kingdom of Christ. 15. chapter / lamenteth
that there were found amongst those which are counted of the forwardest
christians / which would not have the same disciplyne used now / that was in
the times of the Apostles / obiecting the differences of times / and of men.

2. That one mynister ought not to have any dominion over an other.
The foresaid Heluetian Confession. etc. in the seuententh Chapter / says
that Christ did most severely prohibit unto his Apostles / and their
successors / primacy / and domynion / and in the 18. Chap. says that equal
power / and function / in given unto all the mynisters of the church and that
from the beginning no one preferred him self to a another / saving only ye for
order / some one did call the^ together / propounde the matters that were to be
consulted of / and gathered the voices. etc.

Musculus in his Common places / in the chap. of the offices of the mynisters
of the word / says that in the Apostolic church / the ministers of the word /
were none above an other / nor subject to any head / or president / and
mislyketh the setting up of any one in higher degree then an other. And further
he says upon the second chap. of the second Epistle to the Thessalonians /
that the honor of a bishop / being taken from the rest of the mynisters / and
given to one / was the first step to the papacy / how so ever in other places
he speaks otherwise.

3. That the election of mynisters pertayneth not to one man.
The foresaid Heluetian Confession. etc. in the. 18. Chapter says that the
mynisters ought to be chosen of the church / or by those which are lawfully
deputed of the church / and afterward ordained with public prayers.

M. Calvin in his. 4. book of Institutions. 3. chap. 15. section / shows
that the Church did choose / and that the Apostles did monderate the election /
and confuteth them which upon the places of Titus and Timothe / would prove
that the election belongs to one man.

4. That there ought now to be elders to govern the church with the Pastors /
and Deacons to provide for the poor.
Touching Elders / the judgment of M. Calvin has been before declared in the
first of these propositions.

M. Beza in his book of divorces / page. 161. says / that the Eldershyp of
the church ought to be / where there is a Christian magistrate.

Touching Deacons / M. Calvin. 4. book. 3. chap. 9. section / after that he
had described what deacons the churches had in the Apostles times / says that
we / after their example ought to have the like.

M. Beza in the. 5. cap. and. 23. section of his confessions / shows that the
office of the distribution of the goods of the church / is an ordinary
function in a church lawfully constituted / which office in the. 30. he calls
the Deaconship.

P. Martyr upon the. 12. to the Romans speaking of the Elders / which did asist
the pastor in every Church / and of the Deacons / lamenteth that this order is
so fallen out of the church / that the names of these functions do skarce
remain.

M. Bucer in his first book of the kingdom of Christ / for the auncientes of
the Church says / that the number of the Elders of every church / ought to be
increased according to the multitude of the people / and in the. 14. chap. of
the same book says that this order of Deaconshyppe / was relygiously kept in
the church / until it was driven out by Antichrist.

5. That excommunication pertayneth not to any one man in the Church.
M. Calvin in his Institutions. 4. book. and. 11. chap. and. 6. section
teaches that Excommunication pertayneth not to one man / and that it was too
wicked a fact / that one man taking the authority which was common to other /
to himself alone / opened a way to tyranny / took from the Church her right /
and abrogated the church Senate / ordained by the spirit of Christ. And in
the. 12. chap. and. 7. section / he says further that it ought not to be
done without the knowledge and approbation of the Church.

M. Beza in his confessions. 5. chap. 43. section / says that this power of
excommunicating is given to no one man / except it please God to work
extraordinarily.

Peter Martyr upon the. 1. to the Corinthes / and. 5. chap. says that it is
very dangerous / to permit so weighty a matter as excommunication / to the
discretion and will of any one man. And therefore / both that tyranny might be
avoided / and this censure executed with greater fruit / and gravity / that
the order which the Apostle there uses / is still to be observed.

M. Bucer of the kingdom of Christ / in the. 1. book. and. 9. chap. says
that S. Paul accuses the Corinthians / for that the whole church / did not
cast out of their company the incestuous person.

6. That Chauncelors / Commissaries / Officials. etc. usurp authority in the
Church / which belongs not to them.
M. Calvin in his Institutions. 4. book. 11. chap. 7. sect. speaks against
the office of Officials / and alleges diverse reasons against them / as that
they exercise that part of the Bishops charge / and that they handle matters
which pertayne not to the spiritual jurisdiction.

M. Beza in his book of Divorces / proving that the judicial deciding of
matrimonyall causes appertains unto the cyuill magistrate / says that
officials / proctors / and promoters / and in a word all the swinish filth /
now of long time has wasted the church.

Peter Martyr upon the. 13. chap. to the Romans / speaking against the civil
jurisdiction of bishops / does by the same reason condemn it in their deputies
the officials.

7. That the mynisters of the word / ought not to exercise any civil offices
and jurisdiction.
M. Calvin in his Institutions. 4. book. 11. chap. 9. sect. brings diverse
reasons to prove that bishops may neither usurp / nor take being given them /
either the right of the sword / or the knowledge of civil causes.

M. Beza in his Confessions. chap. 5. sect. 32. says that the Ecclesiastical
jurisdiction is to be distinguished from the civil / and that although the
bishops in the times of Christian Emperoures were troubled with the hearing of
cyuill causes yet they did not that by any judicial power / which they
exercised / but by a friendly entreaty of the parties / which were at discord:
and says notwithstanding / that herein the Emperors did give too much to the
ambytion of certain bishops / whereupon by little / and by little /
afterward all things were confounded. And in the. 42. section / says that
those corporal punyshmentes which the Apostles exercised / were peculier / and
extraordinary.

Peter Martyr upon the. 13. to the Romans / speaking of this meeting of both
Ecclesiastical / and civil jurisdiction in one man / says / that when both
the civil / and Ecclesiastical functions do so meet / that one hinders the
other / so that he which exercises the one / can not mynister the other.

M. Bucer upon the. 5. of Matthew / says that there is no man so wise / and
holy / which is able to exercise both the civil / and the Ecclesiastical
power / and that therefore he which will exercise the one / must leave the other.

8. That the sacraments ought not to be privately administered / nor by women.
The foresaid confession.c. 20. holds that baptism ought not to be mynistred
by women / or midwiues / to the which also may be joined the Liturgy of the
English church at Geneua / which condemns the mynistring of either of the
sacraments in private houses / or by women.

Peter Martyr upon the. 11. chap. of the. 1. ep. to the Corinthes / in
describing the corruptions of the Lords supper / notes this to be one / that
the church did not communicate altogether / which corruption as it was in
diverse places in times past / so he complayneth that it is now.

M. Bucer in his first book of the kingdom of Christ / and. 7. chap. proves
out of the. 10. to the Corinth. that the whole church should receive the supper
of the Lord together / and that the use of the church of God in this behalf /
ought with great and dyligent endeavor to be restored unto the churches / and
that it is a contempt of the mysteries / not to be partakers / when they are
called.

M. Beza against Westphalus / shows that it is not decent that baptism be
mynistred but in the church / and that at standing hours / and by the
mynisters / and further / that upon no necessity (as it is called) it ought
to be mynistred in private houses. And that if it might be mynistred in private
houses / yet no otherwise then by mynisters.

M. Calvin in his institutions. 4. book. chap. 15. sect. 20. 21. proves that
baptism ought not to be mynistred by private men / or by any women.

9. The judgment of those late writers touching ceremonies and apparel /
whose secret Epistles M. Doctor alleges / appears by these places following
/ cited but of their works Printed / and published by them selves. Whereof also
some are alleged by the answerer to the examiner / where are diverse other
places to this purpose / whereunto I refer the Reader.
M. Bucer upon the. 18. of Math. says that they say nothing / which do
always object / that greater things must be urged / then the reformation of
ceremonies / thereby defending the relics of Antichrist / forasmuch as
ceremonies are testimonies of religion: And that / as there is no agreement
between Christ and Belial / so those which are sincere Christians / can abide
nothing of Antichrist.

Peter Martyr upon the.10. c. of the.2. book of the kings / says that the
Lutheranes must take heed / least whilst they cut of many popish errors /
they follow Iehu by retayning also many popish things. For they defend still
the real presence in the bread of the supper / and images / and vestmentes.
etc. and says that relygion must be wholly reformed to the quick.

Bullinger in his Decades. 5. book / and. 9. sermon / says that our savior
Christ and the Apostles used their accustomed apparel in the supper / and that
although in times past the ministers put on a kind of cloak upon their common
apparel / yet that was done neither by the example of Christ / nor of his
Apostles / but by the tradition of man / and that in the end / after the
example of the priests apparel in the old law / it was cast upon the
mynisters / at the ministration of the supper. But (says he) we have learned
long ago / not only that all Leuiticall ceremonies are abrogated / but also
that they ought to be brought again into the church of no man. And therefore
seeing we are in the light of the gospel / and not under the shadow of the law
/ we do worthily reject / that massing Leuiticall apparel.

Gualter upon the. 21. of the Acts / among others / brings this for one
reason / to improve Paul's shauing of his head: for that the gospel had been
preached.xx. years / and that therefore the infirmity of the Jews ought not
to have been borne with. And after he says that that teaches / how much
the supersticious masters of ceremonies / hurt the gospel / which nourishe
the weakness of faith by the long keeping of ceremonies: and by their long
bearing / hinder the doings of those mynisters / which are more fervent.

FINIS.
