A little ragge of Rethorike
A less lump of Logyke
A piece or a patche of Philosophy
Than forthwith by and by
They tumble so in Theology
Drowned in dregs of Divinity
That they judge them self able to be
Doctors of the Chair in the Vyntre
At the three Crames
To magnifye their names
But madly it frames.
For all that they preche and teache
Is farther than their wit will reche
Thus by demeryttes of their abusyon
Finally they fall to careful confusyon
To bear a Faggot or to be enflamed
Thus are they undone and vtily shamed.

Marked in your cradels
To bear fagottes for babyls
And yet some men say

And so ye will be still

What should I reckon more.
Men have you in suspicion
How ye have small contrycion
Of that ye have myswrought

For if it were well sought
One of you there was
That laughed when he did pas
With his faggot in processyon
He counted it for no correction
But with scornful affection
Took it for a sport
His heresy to supporte
Where at a thousand gased
As people half a mased
And thought in him small grace
His folly so to face.
Some iuged in this case

ye should take further pain
To resort again
To places where ye have preched

And knowledge your offense
Before open audyence
How falsely ye had surmysed
And deuyllysshely devised
The people to seduce
And chase them through the muse
Of your noughty counsel
To hunt them in to hell
With blowyng out your horns
Full of mockysshe scorns

But much worse Isagogici
For ye have enduced a sect
With heresy all infecte
Wherefore ye are well checte
And by holy church correct
And in manner as abiecte
For evermore suspecte
And banysshed in effect

Because ye have eaten a fly
