A wonder in Kent: Of the admirable stomach of one Nicholas Wood, dwelling at
Harrisom in the County of Kent.
The like of him was never heard,
As in this Ditty is declared.
To the tune of, The maunding Soldier.
ALL you that valiant fell^wes be,
I pray give ear a while to me,
I tell you of a Champion bold,
That fights not for the fame of gold,
but for good belly cheer,
as well it does appear,
the like whereof you nere did hear.
none may with him compare,
as I will here declare,
the like lives not I dare to swear.
In Kent this fellow now does live,
At Harrisom as report does give,
His Name is called Nicholas Wood,
As I for truth have understood,
well known by men of fame,
his worth and nome,
that well can justify the same,
some Gentlemen and Knights,
to ^^^sfie delights,
have sent for Wood to see his sleights.
^e is not like these puling ones,
(...) an hour picking bones,
A Sheep or Calfe that's worth a Mark,
On them heel bravely fall to work,
or if a Hog it be,
all is ^ne quoth he,
in one hours space you (...) shall see,
his stomach is so strong,
nothing will do him wrong,
the Devil (...) sure his guts among.
What talk I of a Sheep or Calfe,
A^as these exploits are not half,
A Hogs a thing that much will eat,
Fish, Flesh, Fowls, Frogs, or such like meat,
yet Wood is of such power,
that he within an hour
a good fat Hog he did devour,
his like was never none
as plainly may be shone,
not one like him was ever known.
After that he had eat this Hog,
I do not mean to lie nor cogge,
Three pecks of D^msons he did eat,
For to digest his Swinish meat,
Another time beside,
he being tried:
seven dozen of Rabbets he (...),
likewise he took in hand,
to eat a Flea^h of Brown
as soon as from the Bore it was drawn,
At Sir William Sidleyes house he eat,
As men of credit do repeat,
As much as thoroughly would suffice,
Full thirty men, Oh gurmudize,
but then unto the fire,
he did retire,
and for some grease be did desire,
thinking his belly he
would break immediately
unless he had speedy remedy,
A quarter of a good fat (...),
And three score Eggs he ouerc^me,
And right^ene parts of black pudding,
And a raw Ducke all but Bill and Wing,
and after he had dined,
as I do find,
he longed for Cherries yt bravely shined
then threescore pound they brought,
which he could (...) to naught,
a thing impossible me thought,
His mighty paunch does harbor all,
Sheep, Hoggs or Calves, (...) stall,
A Pa^kett is likewise for Dear,
And C^nneyes gray, or silver hair
a (...) it is besides
whereas he hides
all kind of fruits that him besides
Cheese, Buttermilke and Whey,
he brings in that way,
thus he brings all quite to decay,
The second part. To the same tune.
THe Norfolk Dumpling he ore came,
The Devonshire white-pot he made ^ame
The bag-pudding of Gloucester
The blackepudding of Wostershire,
the Shrop-shire pan-pudding,
and such gutting,
and Somersetshire white-pudding,
or any other Shire,
their puddings heel not fear
none may with Nicholas Wood compare:
The Clothiers that in Kent do dwell,
In Sussex of this man did tell,
To some of the chiefest yeomen there,
Who greatly mused when they did hear,
and ofred presently
that they would lay,
a hundred pound of good money,
that he could not devour,
a wh^le calfe in an hour,
they thought it was not in his power,
(...) wager thus betwixt them laid,
The Sussex men grew sore afraid,
^od of their match they did repent,
Desiring that they might recant,
the kentish men did say,
that they should pay,
ten pounds or stand the match and day,
then so they did agree,
and spent it merrily,
but Wood mist of their company.
A Gentleman by chance did come,
Where friends of his was in the room
And they were all at diner set.
But he with them eat not a bit,
when the reckoning was paid,
the tapster said
that twelve pence more most be defraid,
by him that l^st come in,
which had not at diner ben
Whereat the Gentleman in spleen.
Did pay the same and said no more,
But after plagued them therefore,
An other time he did come there,
And brought Wood with him to a fair
then to the Inn he went,
whereas he spent,
a shilling once by ill consent
and telling Wood his mind,
being thus (...),
to call much meat and leave Wood behind
Come hosts quickly let be brought
As much good meat as may be thought
To satisfy a dozen men,
The hastes quickly sent it in
come sit down Wood quoth he,
and I Will go see,
for some more of our company,
but ere he came again,
the tayster he came in
thinking the devil there had been.
The tapster did his Mistress call,
And said the man had eat by all,
Then into the room she came with speed,
And found the same was true indeed,
then she began to swear
and pull and tear
with Wood for money for his fare
and he said he was willing,
to pay her down a shilling
he ^^tted her for former dealing.
Two Citizens from London went,
To see this Wood was their intent,
And being come to Harrisom,
They sent for him into the room,
for all the victuals they
did call and pay,
that was within the house that day,
and wished goodman Wood,
to fall (...) his food
I marry quoth he that is good.
These Citizens found him to be,
So ^^range the like they eu'r did see,
Desiring him that he would go^,
To London, he resolved so,
then at the last he said,
he was a fraid
the same to the King should be beraid;
and so he hanged might be,
therefore this thought had he,
it is best staying in Kent for me.
His porrige boule is full two perks,
He is not of the weakest sex,
Good Ale grains some times he does eat,
For want of other sort of meat,
I do not tell no lie,
those that will forther try,
a book of him likewise may buy,
where much more is declared,
as I have read and heard
none like to him may be compared.
