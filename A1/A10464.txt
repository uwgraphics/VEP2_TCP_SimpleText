The famous Ratketcher, with his travels into France, and of his return to
London.
To the tune of the iouiall Tinker.


THere was a rare Rat-catcher,
Did about the Country wander,
The soundest blade of all his trade,
Or I should him deeply slander:
For still would he cry, a Ratt tat tat, tara rat, ever:
To catch a Mouse, or to carouse.
such a Ratter I saw never.
Upon a Poale he carried
Full forty fulsome Uermine:
Whose cursed ^ues without any Knives,
To take he did determine.
And still would he cry, a Rat tat tat, tara Rat, ever, etc.
His talk was all of India,
The Uoyage and the Navy:
What Mise or Rattes, or wild Polcats:
What Stoates or Weesels have ye?
And still would he cry, a Rat, etc.
He knew the Nut of India,
That makes the Magpie stagger:
The Mercuries, and Cantharies,
With Arsnicke, and Roseaker.
And still would he cry, a Rat, etc.
Full often with a Negro,
The Juice of Poppies drunk he:
Eat Poison t^^nke with a Mountebanke,
And Spiders with a Monkie.
And still would he cry, a Rat, etc.
In London he was well known:
In many a slately House
He (...) a Bayse; whose deadly fate,
(...) kill both Rat^^ and Mouse.
And still would he cry, a Rat, etc.
But on a time, a Damos^ll,
did him so far entice,
That for her, a Bait he laid straight,
would kill no Rats nor Mice.
And still would he cry, a Rat, etc.
And on the Bait she nibled,
so pleasing in her taste,
She lickt so long, that the Poison strong,
did make her swell in the waste.
And still would he cry, a Rat, etc.
He^tilely this perceiving,
to the Country straight does hie him:
Where by his skill, he poysoneth still,
such Uermine as come nie him.
And still would he cry, a Rat, etc.
He never cares whether
he be sober, lame, or tipsie:
He can Collogue with any Rogue,
and Cant with any Gypsy.
And still would he cry, a Rat, etc.
He was so brave a bowzer,
that it was doubtful whether
He taught the Rats, or the Rats taught him
to be druncke as Rats, together.
And still would he cry, a Rat, etc.
When he had tript this Island,
from Bristow unto Dover,
With painful Bag and painted Flagge,
to France he sailed over.
Yet still would he cry, a Rat tat tat, tara rat, ever, etc.
FINIS.
The Ratketchers return out of France to London. To the same tune.


IN France when he arrived,
the heat so much perplexed him,
That all his Pouch did swell so much,
and Poison so had vexed him.
That scarce could he cry, a Rat tat tat. tara Rat, ever:
To catch a Mouse, or to carouse,
Such a Ratter I saw never.
At last, as (...) ^ommon,
must use another ayding:
So did this Ratter, tell the matter
to another of's own trading.
And then did he cry, a Rat tat tat. etc.
Who using ma^^ Simples,
to quench ^^^stery burning:
Did make him dance clean out of France,
And home he is now returning.
And still does he cry, a Rat, etc.
At Dover he arrived,
and Kent has had his cunning:
The Maidens Lappes like poisoned Rattes
repent his backe-home coming.
For still does he cry, a Rat, etc.
At Grauesend amongst the Maidens,
Green sickness reigned so briefly,
None could have cure, but such as sure
would take his Potions chiefly.
And still does he cry, a Rat, etc.
The Ship wherein he sailed,
ere he on shore arrived,
Reports him that he killed a Ratte,
that nere will be revived.
And still does he cry, a Rat, etc.

And to the Fair in Smithfield,
he now is gone and paced:
To search with Pole for the Rat-knawne hole
that him so much outfaced.
And still does he cry, a Rat, etc.
Now to the Tippling houses,
to kill the Uermine featly:
French Rats and Mice all in a trice,
he will destroy full neatly.
And still does he cry, a Rat, etc.
An ugly Wench to see-to,
whose Nose was knawne with Uermin,
The Ratte to kill, that vsd her ill,
to use him does determine.
And still does he cry, a Rat. etc.
If any other Maidens,
or Female kinds, will use him,
Come call him quick, for with a trick
he is gone, if you refuse him.
And still does he cry, a Rat, etc.
To Sturbridge Fair his iourny
is plotted, and appointed:
Approach with speed, you that have need
with Poison to be noynted.
And still does he cry, a Rat, etc.
When back he comes home-ward,
observe his Flagge be painted
With Mice and Rattes, and with Poulcats,
if you will be acquainted,
And hear him to cry, a Rat tat tat, tara Rat, ever:
To catch a Mouse, or to carouse,
such a Ratter I saw never.
FINIS.
