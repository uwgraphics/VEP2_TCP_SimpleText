TO THE RIGHT HONOrable, Sir William Cecill Knight, Baron of Burghley, Lord
high Treasorer of England. William Swayne wishes long life, and the same to be
most healthie and happy.
RIght Honorable my singular good Lord, there came to my hands of late a book
containing all the tunes of the Psalms, as they are ordinarily soung in the
Church, composed into four parts by M. William Damon late one of her Majesty's
servant, which book being found not only in my poor opinion, but in the
riper judgment of some special Musicions to be excellently set, either to
serve for voices or instruments: for the great use that might come thereof, and
partly to preserve the labors of the Auctor, so worthy and skillfull a man
in his profession: also to leave his Religion and piety herein witnessed, that
so carefully and specially labored to advance the use of singing the
Psalms: I was earnestly dealt with all not to deteyne that as a part of my
private store in Music, that of it self contained matter so worthy
publicly to enterteyne and to receive enterteynment. Therefore with their
persuasions and reasons, I was brought to publish them for the use and comfort
of all, especially of the godly. And now right honorable my very good Lord,
calling to mind the duty, honor, and service due by me unto your good
Lordship, for the great love and favor which I have always received at your
L. hands. (For I acknowledge my self to none more bound then to your honor:) I
have been the more emboldened to present this simple work to pass under your
L. favor and protection. Wishing that the same may chiefly serve to the
glory and praise of God. And then at your L. pleasure, at some times for the
recreation of your mind, after your worthy and great travail from day to day
taken in the most weighty affairs of this common wealth. And so I commend
your good L. to the merciful keeping of thalmightie God.

Your good L. most bound during life, William Swayne.

To the Reader.
HEretofore gentle Reader, M. William Damon one of her Majesty's Musitions,
being earnestly requested by a friend of his did at sundry times when he
resorted to his friends house compose the tunes of David's Psalms as they are
ordinarily soung in the Church note for note, intending the^ for his friends
private use. These Psalms so set, and made without labor or purpose to
publish them, were notwithstanding published by the same friend of M. Damon;
which not answering thexpectation that many had of the Auctors skill, gave him
occasion to take upon him a new labor to recover the wrong his friend did in
pu^^^^hing that that was so done, as might well please him* ^ut was not
purposed or framed for the learned ears of our times. Therefore at his best
leisure and fittest times he composed the same tunes again in so excellent a
manner that by comparison of these and the former, the Reader may by trial see
that the Auctor could not receive in his Art such a note of disgrace by his
friends oversight before, but that now the same is taken away, and his worthy
knowledge much more graced by this second travail. Now to acquaynt thee with
the Auctors order in this second work, he has for variety gone through the
Psalms twice, which are now divided into two Setts: whereof in the former the
ordinary singing part is carried in the Tenor: In the second set it is conveyed
in the highest part. Herein there is required of the Reader, if he be a lover of
Music, that he would accept of their labor that have taken pains in
publishing exactlie a work of such singular skill, and special use for them,
that after the serious labor of their calling are desirous rather to recreate
them selves in singing of Psalms, then in other exercises of less comfort,
and evil mark.

Veni Creator.
^COme holy Ghost eternal God, proceeding from a- ^boue, both from the Father
and the Son, the God of ^peace and love, of peace and love, visit our minds
and into us, and into us, ^thy heavenly grace inspire, that in all truth and
godliness, and godliness ^we may have true desire.

The humble suit of a sinner.
^O Lord of whom I do depend, behold my careful heart, and when thy ^will and
pleasure is, release me of my smart, thou see my sorrows what they are, my
^griefe is known to thee, and there is none that can remove or take the same
from me.

Te Deum.
^WE praise thee God, we knowledge ^thee, we knowledge thee, the only ^Lord to
be. And as eternal Father ^all, the earth does worship thee. To thee all
Angels cry, the heavens and all the ^powers therein: To thee Cherub and
Seraphin, to cry they do not linne. to ^cry they do not linne. ^ ^ ^

The song of the three Children.
^O All ye works of God the Lord, bless ye the ^Lord, praise him and magnify
him for ever. ^

Benedictus.
^THe only Lord of Israel, be praised ever- more: ^For through his vi- si-
ta- ti- on and mercy kept in ^store, his people now he has redemd, that long
has been in thrall, that long has ^bene in thrall, and spread abroad his
saving health, upon his servants all. upon his ^seruants all.

Magnificat.
^MY soul does magnify the Lord, my spirit eke ^euermore, rejoices in the
Lord my God which ^is my savior. And why because he did regard, and gave
respect un- to, so ^base estate of his handmayd, and let the mighty go. the
mighty go. ^

Nunc dimittis. This part following keeps the plain song of the church tune.
^O Lord because my hearts desire, has wished ^long to see: My only Lord and
Saui- our, thy ^sonne before I die: The joy and health of ^all mankind de-
sired long before, which now is come into the world, of ^mercie bringing store.
bringing store. ^

Quicunque vult.
^WHat man soever he be that, soever he be that salvation ^will attain: The
Catholic belief he must, belief he ^must, before all things retain. Which
Faith unless he holy keep, and vnde- ^filedly, and vndefiledly: Without all
doubt eternally, without all doubt eternal- ^ly, he shall be sure to dye.

The Lamentation of a sinner.
^O Lord turn not away thy face, from him that lies pro- ^strate: Lamenting
sore his sinful life, before thy mercy gate, ^before thy mercy gate, which gate
thou openest wide to those, that do lament ^their sin, shut not that gate,
shut not that gate, against me Lord, but let me ^enter in. let me enter in,
enter in.

The Lords prayer.
^OVr Father which in heaven art. Lord hallowed be thy ^name. Thy kingdom
come, Thy kingdom come thy will be ^done in earth, even as the same in heaven
is. Give us O Lord, our daily bread this ^day, as we forgive, as we forgive our
debtors so, forgive our debts we pray. Into temp- ^tation lead us not. From
evil make us free: for kingdom power and glory thine ^both now and ever be,
both now and ever be.

The X. Commandments.
^HArke Israel, and what I say, hark Israel and what I say, give ^heed to
understand: give heed to understand, I am the ^Lord, I am the Lord thy God
that brought the out of Egypt land, Even from the ^house wherein thou did in
thraldom live a slave, live a slave. None other Gods at ^all before, my
presence shall thou have, shall thou have, my presence shall thou have.

The complaint of a sinner. The Church tune.
^WHere righteousness does say, Lord for my sinful ^part, In wrath thou
should me pay, vengeance for my de- ^sert, I can it not deny, but needs I
must confess, how that continually thy ^lawes I do transgress, thy laws I do
transgres.

Here begins the Psalms.
Psalm. 1.
^THe man is blessed that has not bent, to wicked read ^his ear, Nor led his
life as sinners do, nor sat in scorners ^chaire: in scorners chair: But in
the law of God: But in the law of God the ^Lord, does set his whole delight,
does set his whole deligh^* and in that law ^doth exercise himself, himself
both day and night, himself both day and ^night, both day and night.

Psalm. 3.
^O Lord how are my foes increst, O Lord how ^are my foes increast, which vex
me, vex me more and ^more? they kill my heart when as they say, God can him not
restore, ij. But ^thou O Lord art my de- fence, art my defense, when I am hard
^^stead: my worship and ^mine honor both, mine honor both, and thou holdst up
my head. ij.

Psalm. 6.
^LORD in thy wrath reprove me not, reprove me not ^though I deserve thine ire:
Ne yet correct me in thy ^rage, O Lord, I thee desire. For I am weak, for I
am weak, therefore O Lord ^of mercy me forbear, and heal me Lord, and heal
me Lord, for why? thou know, my ^bones do quake for fear. my bones do quake
for fear.

Psalm. 14.
^THere is no God as foolish men, there is no God ^as foolish men affirm
affirm in their mad mood: ^their driftes are all corupt and vain, corupt and
vain, not one of them does ^good. The Lord beheld, the Lord beheld from heaven
hye, the whole race of man- ^kinde: And saw not one that sought in deed the
living God to find. ^

Psalm. 18.
^O God my strength and fortitude, and forti- ^tude, O God my strength and
fortitude, of force I ^must love thee: thou art my castle and defense in ^my
necessity. My God my rock in whom I rrust, My God my rock in ^whome I
trust, in whom I trust, the worker of my wealth, of my wealth, My ^refuge,
buckler and my shield, my buckler and my shield the horn of all my health.

Psalm. 21. The Church tune.
^O Lord how joyful is the king, in thy strength ^and thy power? How vehemently
does he rejoice, ^in thee his Savior? For thou have given unto ^him, his godly
hearts desire: To him nothing have thou denide, of that he did require. ^

Psalm. 23.
^MY Sheapheard is the living Lord, nothing there- ^fore I need, therefore I
need: In pastures fair, in ^pastures fair with waters calm, he set me for
to feed. he set me for to feed.

Psalm. 25.
^I Lift mine heart to thee, I lift mine heart to thee, mine ^hart to thee, my
God and guide most just: Now ^suffer me to take no shame, to take no shame for
in thee do I ^trust. Let not my foes rejoice, nor make a scorn of me: a
scorn of ^mee: And let them not be overthrown, that put their trust in thee.
that ^put their trust in thee. ^ ^ ^

Psalm. 25. The church tune. An other of the same.
^I Lift mine heart to thee, my God and guide most ^iust: Now suffer me to take
no shame, for in thee ^do I trust, for in the do I trust. ^ ^

Psalm. 30.
^ALL laud and praise with heart and voice, all laud ^and praise with heart and
voice, O Lord I guie to thee: ^which did not make my foes rejoice, but have
exalted me, O Lord my God to ^thee I cride, to thee I cride in all my pain and
grief, thou gave an ear thou ^gauest an ear, and did provide to ease me
with relief, to ease me with relief. ^

Psalm. 41.
^THe man is blessed that careful is, that careful ^is, the needy to con-sider,
to consider. For in the ^season peri- lous: the Lord will him deliver. The Lord
will make him safe and ^sound, and happy in the land, and he will not deliver
him, deliver him ^into his enemies hand.

Psalm. 44.
^OVr ears have heard our fathers tell, and ^reuerently record: the wondrous
works that thou ^hast done, the wondrous works that thou ^hast done in older
time O Lord. How thou did cast the Gentiles out, the Gentiles ^out, and
stroydst them with strong hand, planting our fathers in their place ^and gave
to them their land.

Psalm. 46.
^THe Lord is our defense and aid, is our defense ^and aid, the strength
whereby we stand, when ^we with woe are much dismayed, are much dismayed, he is
our help at hand. Though ^thearth remove we will not fear, though hills so
high and steep: Be thrust and ^hurled here and there, and there, within the
Sea so deep.

Psalm 50.
^THe mighty God, theternall has thus spoke theternall ^hath thus spoke, and
all the world he will call and pro- uoke, ^euen from the East, and so forth to
the West, ij. From toward Sion ^which place him likes best, which place him
likes best, God will appear in beauty ^most excellent. Our God will come, Our
God will come before ye long time be spent.

Psalm. 50. An other of the same.
^THe God of Gods the Lord has called the ^earth by name: From where the Sun
does rise, un- ^to the setting of the same. From Sion his fair place, his
glory, bright and clear: ^The perfect beauty of his grace, from thence it
did appear.

Psalm. 51.
^O Lord consider my distress, consider my distress, ^and now with speed
some pity take, My sins de- ^face, my faults re- dress, my faults redress,
good Lord for thy great mercy ^sake, great mercies sake. Wash me (O Lord),
Wash me O Lord and make me ^cleane, from this unjust and sinful act: and
pu-rifie yet once again, my heinous ^crime and bloody fact. my heinous crime
and bloody fact. ^

Psalm. 52. The Church tune.
^WHy do thou tyrant boast abroad, thy wicked ^works to praise? do thou
not know there is a God, whose ^mercies last always? Why does thy mind yet
still devise, such wicked wiles to ^warpe? Thy tongue untrue in forging lies,
is like a rasour sharp.

Psalm. 59.
^SEnd aid and save me from my foes, O Lord I pray to ^thee: Defend and keep
me, from all those, and keep me from all ^those that rise and strive with me.
O Lord, O Lord preserve me from those ^men, preserve me from those men, whose
doings are not good: And set me sure, and ^safe from them, that still thirst
after blood. that still thirst after blood.

Psalm. 61.
^REgard (O Lord) for I complain, and make my ^sute to thee: my suit to thee:
Let not my words return in ^vaine, Let not my words return in vain, but give
an ear to me. From of the ^coastes and utmost parts, of all the earth abroad:
of all the earth abroad: In grief and ^anguish of my heart, and anguish of my
heart, I cry to thee O God. to thee (O God.) ^

Psalm. 68.
^LEt God arise and then his foes, Let God arise and the^ his ^foes, will turn
them selves to flight: His enmies then will ^runne abroad, will run abroad,
and scatter out of sight. And as the fire does ^melt the wax, and wind blow
smoke a- way: So in the presence of the Lord, of the ^Lord, of the Lord, the
wicked shall de- cay. shall decay.

Psalm. 69. The Church tune.
^SAue me O God and that with speed, the waters ^flow full fast: so ny my
soul do they proceed, that I am ^sore aghast. I stick full deep in filth and
clay, whereas I feel no ground, I fall into ^such floods I say, that I am like
be drowned. be drowned. ^

Psalm. 72.
^LOrd give thy judgments to the King, Lord give thy ^iudgements to the king,
therein instruct him well: And ^with his son, that princely thing, Lord let
thy justice dwell. That he may govern ^vprightly, govern uprightly, and rule
thy folk aright: And so defend, And ^so defend through equity, the poor that
have no might, that have no might. ^

Psalm. 77. The Church tune.
^I With my voice to God do cry, with heart and hearty ^cheare: My voice to God.
I lift on hie, and he my ^sute does hear. In time of grief I sought to God,
by night no rest I took: ^But stretched my hands to him abroad, my Soul
comfort forsook. com- ^fort forsook.

Psalm. 78.
^ATtend my people to my law, and to my words in- ^cline: My mouth shall speak
strange parables, strange ^para- bles, and sentences divine. Which we our
selves have hard and learnd, even of ^our fathers old: and which for our
instruction, instruction, our fathers have us ^told. have us told.

Psalm. 81. The Church tune.
^BE light and glad in God rejoice, which is our ^strength and stay: be joyful
and lift up your voice, to ^I^cobs God I say. Prepare your instruments most
meet, some joyful spalme to ^sing* strike up with harp and lute so sweet, on
every pleasant string. ^ ^

Psalm. 88.

The former Book of the Music of M. William Damon, late one of her majesty's
Musitions: containing all the tunes of David's Psalms, as they are ordinarily
soung in the Church: most excellently by him composed into 4. parts. In which
Set the Tenor sings the Church tune.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable, Sir William Cecill Knight, Baron of Burghley, Lord
high Treasorer of England. William Swayne wishes long life, and the same to be
most healthie and happy.
RIght Honorable my singular good Lord, there came to my hands of late a book
containing all the tunes of the Psalms, as they are ordinarily soung in the
Church, composed into four parts by M. William Damon late one of her Majesty's
servant, which book being found not only in my poor opinion, but in the
riper judgment of some special Musicions to be excellently set, either to
serve for voices or instruments: for the great use that might come thereof, and
partly to preserve the labors of the Auctor, so worthy and skillfull a man
in his profession: also to leave his Religion and piety herein witnessed, that
so carefully and specially labored to advance the use of singing the
Psalms: I was earnestly dealt with all not to deteyne that as a part of my
private store in Music, that of it self contained matter so worthy
publicly to enterteyne and to receive enterteynment. Therefore with their
persuasions and reasons, I was brought to publish them for the use and comfort
of all, especially of the godly. And now right honorable my very good Lord,
calling to mind the duty, honor, and service due by me unto your good
Lordship, for the great love and favor which I have always received at your
L. hands. (For I acknowledge my self to none more bound then to your honor:) I
have been the more emboldened to present this simple work to pass under your
L. favor and protection. Wishing that the same may chiefly serve to the
glory and praise of God. And then at your L. pleasure, at some times for the
recreation of your mind, after your worthy and great travail from day to day
taken in the most weighty affairs of this common wealth. And so I commend
your good L. to the merciful keeping of thalmightie God.

Your good L. most bound during life, William Swayne.

To the Reader.
HEretofore gentle Reader, M. William Damon one of her Majesty's Musitions,
being earnestly requested by a friend of his did at sundry times when he
resorted to his friends house compose the tunes of David's Psalms as they are
ordinarily soung in the Church note for note, intending the^ for his friends
private use. These Psalms so set, and made without labor or purpose to
publish them, were notwithstanding published by the same friend of M. Damon;
which not answering thexpectation that many had of the Auctors skill, gave him
occasion to take upon him a new labor to recover the wrong his friend did in
publishing that that was so done, as might well please him, but was not
purposed or framed for the learned ears of our times. Therefore at his best
leisure and fittest times he composed the same tunes again in so excellent a
manner that by comparison of these and the former, the Reader may by trial see
that the Auctor could not receive in his Art such a note of disgrace by his
friends oversight before, but that now the same is taken away, and his worthy
knowledge much more graced by this second travail. Now to acquaynt thee with
the Auctors order in this second work, he has for variety gone through the
Psalms twice, which are now divided into two Setts: whereof in the former the
ordinary singing part is carried in the Tenor: In the second set it is conveyed
in the highest part. Herein there is required of the Reader, if he be a lover of
Music, that he would accept of their labor that have taken pains in
publishing exactlie a work of such singular skill, and special use for them,
that after the serious labor of their calling are desirous rather to recreate
them selves in singing of Psalms, then in other exercises of less comfort,
and evil mark.

Veni Creator.
^COme holy Ghost eternal God, proceeding from above, ^both from the Father and
the Son, the God of peace and ^loue, visit our minds and into us, thy
heavenly grace inspire, that in all ^truth and godliness, we may have true
desire.

The humble suit of a sinner.
^O Lord of whom I do depend, behold my careful heart, ^and when thy will and
pleasure is, release me of my smart, thou see my ^sorrowes what they are my
grief is known to thee and there is none that ^can remove or take the same
from me.

Te Deum.
^WE praise thee God, we knowledge ^thee, the only Lord to be. And ^as eter-
nall Father all, the earth does ^worship thee. To thee all Angels cry, the
heavens and all the powers therein: ^To thee Cherub and Seraphin, to cry they
do not linne. to cry they do not linne.

The song of the three Children.
^O All ye works of God the Lord, ^blesse ye the Lord, praise him and
magnify ^him for ever.

Benedictus.
^THe only Lord of Israel, be praised evermore: ^For through his vi- si- ta-
ti-on and mercy kept in ^store, his people now he has redemd, that long has
been in thrall, and spread a- ^broad his saving health, upon his servants all.
upon his servants all. ^ ^ ^ ^

Magnificat.
^MY soul does magnify the Lord, my spirit eke ^euermore, rejoices in the
Lord my God which is my ^sauiour. And why because he did regard, and gave
respect unto, so base ^estate of his handmayd, and let the mighty go. ^

Nunc dimittis.
^O Lord because my hearts desire, has wished ^long to see: My only Lord and
Saui- our, thy ^sonne before I die: The joy and health of all man- ^kind
desired long before, desired long before, which now is come into the world, of
^mercie bringing store. bringing store. ^ ^

Quicunque vult.
^WHat man soever he be that sal- uation will attain: ^The catholic belief
he must before all things re- ^taine. Which Faith unless he holy keep, and
vndefiledly: Without all ^doubt eternally he shall be sure to dye.

The Lamentation of a sinner.
^O Lord turn not away thy face, from him that ^lyeth prostrate: Lamenting
sore his sinful life, be- ^fore thy mercy gate, which gate thou openest wide
to those, that do la- ^ment their sin, shut not that gate against me Lord,
but let me enter ^in, enter in.

The Lords prayer.
^OVr Father which in heaven art. Lord hallowed be thy ^name. Thy kingdom
come, thy will be done in earth even ^as the same in heaven is. Give us O
Lord-our daily bread this day, as ^we forgive our debtors so forgive our debts
we pray. Into temptation lead us not. ^From evil make us free: for kingdom
power and glory thine, both now ^and e- uer be.

The X. Commandments.
^HArke Israel, and what I say, give heed to under- ^stand: give heed to
understand: I am the Lord thy God that ^brought thee out of Egypt land. Even
from the house wherein thou did in ^thraldom live a slave. None other Gods at
all before, at all before, my presence ^shalt thou have my presence shall thou
have.

The complaint of a sinner.
^WHere righteousness does say, righteousness does ^say, Lord for my
sinful part, Lord for my sinful part, ^In wrath thou should me pay,
vengeance for my desert, I can it not deny, but needs I ^must confess, but
needs I must con- fesse, how that continually thy laws I ^do transgress, how
that continually, thy laws I do transgres thy laws I do transgres.

Here begins the Psalms.
Psalm. 1.
^THe man is blessed that has not bent, to wicked ^rede his ear, Nor led his
life as sinners do, nor sat in ^scorners chair: But in the law of God the
Lord, does set his whole delight, and ^in that law does exercise himself both
day and night, himself both ^day and night. ^

Psalm. 3.
^O Lord how are my foes increst, which ^vex me more and more? they kill my
^hart when as they say, God can him not restore. ^But thou O Lord art my
defense when I am hard bestead: my worship and mine ^honor both* and thou
holdst up my head* and thou holdst up my head.

Psalm. 6.
^LORD in thy wrath reprove me not, though I de- ^serue thine ire: Ne yet
correct me in thy rage, O Lord, I ^thee desire. For I am weak, therefore O
Lord of mercy me forbear, and heal me ^Lord, for why? thou know, my bones
do quake for fear. do quake for fear. ^

Psalm. 14.
^THere is no God as foolish men, affirm in ^their mad mood: their driftes
are all corupt and vain not ^one of them does good. The Lord beheld from
heaven hye, the whole race ^of mankind: And saw not one, that sought in deed
the living God to find. ^ ^

Psalm. 18.
^O God my strength and fortitude, of ^force I must love thee: thou art my
castle ^and defense in my necessi- tie. My God my ^rocke in whom I trust, My
God my rock in whom I trust, the worker ^of my wealth, My refuge buckler and
my shield, the horn of all my health.

Psalm. 21.
^O Lord how joyful is the king, O Lord how joy- ^full is the king, in thy
strength and thy power? ^How vehemently does he rejoice, does he re- ^ioyce, in
thee his Saui- our? For thou have given unto him, have given unto him ^his
godly hearts desire: To him nothing have thou denide, have thou denide, of that
^he did require. ^ ^ ^

Psalm. 23.
^MY Sheapheard is the living Lord, nothing therefore ^I need: In pastures
fair, with waters calm, he set ^me for to feed. for to feed.

Psalm. 25.
^I Lift mine heart to thee, mine heart to thee, my ^God and guide most just: Now
suffer me to take no ^shame, for in thee do I trust. Let not my foes rejoice,
nor make a ^scorne of me, a scorn of me: And let them not be overthrown, and
let them ^not be overthrown, that put their trust in thee.

Psalm. 25. An other of the same.
^I Lift mine heart to thee, mine heart to thee, my ^God and guide most just, and
guide most just: Now ^suffer me to take no shame, for in thee do I trust, for
in the do I trust, for ^in thee do I trust. ^

Psalm. 30.
^ALL laud and praise with heart and voice, O ^Lord I give to thee: which did
not make my foes re- ^ioyce, but have exalted me, exal- ted me, O Lord my God
to thee I cride, ^in all my pain and grief, thou gave an ear, thou gave
an ear, and did pro- ^uide, to ease me with relief, with relief. ^ ^

Psalm. 41.
^THe man is blessed that careful is, the needy to ^consi- der: For in the season
perilous, the Lord will ^him deliver. The Lord will make him safe and sound,
and happy in the land, ^and happy in the land, and he will not deliver him,
into his enemies hand.

Psalm. 44.
^OVr ears have heard our fathers tell, our ears have ^heard our fathers
tell, and reverently record: the ^wondrous works that thou have done, that
thou have done, in older time O Lord. ^How thou did cast the Gentiles out, and
stroydst them with strong hand, plan- ^ting our fathers in their place, and
gave to them their land.

Psalm. 46.
^THe Lord is our defense and aid, is our defense and ^ayd, the strength
whereby we stand, when we with woe are ^much dismayed, are much dismayed, he is
our help at hand. Though thearth re- ^moue we will not fear, though thearth
remove we will not fear, though hills so ^high and steep: Be thrust and hurled
here and there, and hurled here and ^there, within the Sea so deep.

Psalm. 50.
^THe mighty God, theternall has thus spoke, ^and all the world he will call
and provoke, even ^from the East, and so forth to the West. From toward Sion
which place him ^liketh best, God will appear in beauty most excellent. Our
God will come be- ^fore that long time be spent, be spent.

Psalm. 50. An other of the same.
^THe God of Gods the Lord has called the earth by ^name: From where the Sun
does rise, the Sun does ^rise, unto the setting of the same. From Sion his
fair place, from Sion his fair ^place, his glory bright and clear: The
perfect beauty of his grace, beauty of his ^grace, from thence it did appear.

Psalm. 51.
^O Lord consider my distress, and now with speed some ^pitie take, My sins
deface, my faults redress, good ^Lord for thy great mercy sake, Wash me (O
Lord) and make me clean, from ^this unjust and sinnfull act: and purify yet
once again, my heinous crime and ^bloudy fact, and bloody fact. ^

Psalm. 52.
^WHy do thou tyrant boast abroad, thy wicked ^workes to praise? thy wicked
works to praise? do thou not ^know there is a God, whose mercies last
always? Why does thy mind yet still de- ^uise, yet still devise, such wicked
wiles to warpe? Thy tongue untrue in forging ^lies, is like a rasour sharp.

Psalm. 59.
^SEnd aid and save me from my foes, O Lord I pray to^ ^thee: Defend and keep
me from all those, that rise and ^striue with me. O Lord preserve me from
those men, whose doings are not ^good: And set me sure, and set me sure and
safe from them that still thirst ^after blood, after blood.

Psalm. 61.
^REgard (O Lord) for I complain, and make my suit ^to thee: Let not my words
return in vain, return in ^vaine, but give an ear to me. From of the
coasts and utmost parts, of ^all the earth abroad: of all the earth abroad: In
grief and anguish of my ^hart, I cry to thee O God. to thee (O God.) ^

Psalm. 68.
^LEt God arise and then his foes, will turn them ^selues to flight: His
enmies then will run abroad, ^and scatter out of sight. And as the fire does
melt the wax, and wind blow ^smoke away: So in the presence of the Lord, the
wicked shall decay. ^shall decay.

Psalm. 69.
^SAue me O GOD and that with speed, and that with ^speed, the waters flow
full fast: the waters flow full fast: ^so ny my soul do they proceed, do they
proceed, that I am sore aghast. I stick full ^deep in filth and clay, in filth
and clay, whereas I feel no ground, I fall in- to, I ^fall into such floods I
say, that I am like be drowned that I am like be drowned.

Psalm. 72.
^LORD give thy judgments to the King, therein in- ^struct him well: And with
his son that princely thing, ^Lord let thy justice dwell. That he may govern
uprightly, and rule thy folk a- ^right: And so defend through equity, the
poor that have no might. that ^haue no might.

Psalm. 77.
^I With my voice to God do cry, to God do cry, with ^hart and hearty cheer:
with heart and hearty cheer: My voice to ^God I lift on hie, I lift on hie, and
he my suit does hear. In time of grief I ^sought to God, I sought to God, by
night no rest I took: But stretched my ^hands to him abroad, to him abroad, my
Soul comfort forsook. com- ^fort forsook.

Psalm. 78.
^ATtend my people to my law, and to my words in- ^cline: My mouth shall
speak strange parables, and ^sentences divine. Which we our selves have hard
and learnd, even of our fathers ^old: and which for our instruction, our
fathers have us told, have us told. ^

Psalm. 81.
^BE light and glad, be light and glad in God rejoice, ^which is our strength
and stay: which is our strength and ^stay: Be joyful and lift up your voice,
to Jacobs God I say. Prepare your instru- ^ments most meet, some joyful
Psalm to sing, strike up with Harp and Lute ^so sweet, on every pleasant
string. ^ ^

Psalm. 88.
^LOrd God of health, the hope and stay, thou ^art alone to me: I call and cry
throughout the day, ^and all the night to thee. O let my prayers soon ascend,
unto thy sight on ^hye: Incline thine ear O Lord, entend and harken to my cry.

Psalm. 100.

mind. to slip out of thy mind. ^

Psalm. 104.
^MY soul praise the Lord, my soul praise the Lord speak ^good of his name,
O Lord our great God how do thou ap- ^peare, how do thou appear, so

clear, with light as a robe thou have thee be- ^clad, thou have thee beclad,
whereby all the earth thy greatness may see, the heavens ^in such sort thou
also have spread, that it to a curtain, compared may be. compared may be.

Psalm. 111.
^WIth heart I do accord, to praise and laud ye Lord, to praise and laud the
^Lord, in presence of the just. For great his works are found, to search them

still remember should, his mercy fails never. fails never.

TO THE RIGH^ ^^^^rable, Sir William C^^^^^ ^^^ght, Baron of Burghley, Lord
hig^ (...) of England. William Swayne wishes long life, and the same to be
most healthie and happy.
RIght Honorable my singular good Lord, there came to my hands of late a book
containing all the tunes of the Psalms, as they are ordinarily soung in the
Church, composed into four parts by M. William Damon late one of her Majesty's
servant, which book being found not only in my poor opinion, but in the
riper judgment of some special Musicions to be excellently set, either to
serve for voices or instruments: for the great use that might come thereof, and
partly to preserve the labors of the Auctor, so worthy and skillfull a man
in his profession: also to leave his Religion and piety herein witnessed, that
so carefully and specially labored to advance the use of singing the
Psalms: I was earnestly dealt with all not to deteyne that as a part of my
private store in Music, that of it self contained matter so worthy
publicly to enterteyne and to receive enterteynment. Therefore with their
persuasions and reasons, I was brought to publish them for the use and comfort
of all, especially of the godly. And now right honorable my very good Lord,
calling to mind the duty, honor, and service due by me unto your good
Lordship, for the great love and favor which I have always received at your
L. hands. (For I acknowledge my self to none more bound then to your honor:) I
have been the more emboldened to present this simple work to pass under your
L. favor and protection. Wishing that the same may chiefly serve to the
glory and praise of God. And then at your L. pleasure, at some times for the
recreation of your mind, after your worthy and great travail from day to day
taken in the most weighty affairs of this common wealth. And so I commend
your good L. to the merciful keeping of thalmightie God.

Your good L. most bound during life, William Swayne.

(...) the Reader.
(...) Reader, M. William Damon one of her Majesty's Musitions, being earnestly
requested by a friend of his did at sundry times when he resorted to his
friends house compose the tunes of David's Psalms as they are ordinarily soung
in the Church note for note, intending the^ for his friends private use. These
Psalms so set, and made without labor or purpose to publish them, were
notwithstanding published by the same friend of M. Damon; which not answering
thexpectation that many had of the Auctors skill, gave him occasion to take
upon him a new labor to recover the wrong his friend did in publishing that
that was so done, as might well please him, but was not purposed or framed for
the learned ears of our times. Therefore at his best leisure and fittest times
he composed the same tunes again in so excellent a manner that by comparison
of these and the former, the Reader may by trial see that the Auctor could not
receive in his Art such a note of disgrace by his friends oversight before, but
that now the same is taken away, and his worthy knowledge much more graced by
this second travail. Now to acquaynt thee with the Auctors order in this
second work, he has for variety gone through the Psalms twice, which are
now divided into two Setts: whereof in the former the ordinary singing part is
carried in the Tenor: In the second set it is conveyed in the highest part.
Herein there is required of the Reader, if he be a lover of Music, that he
would accept of their labor that have taken pains in publishing exactlie a
work of such singular skill, and special use for them, that after the serious
labor of their calling are desirous rather to recreate them selves in singing
of Psalms* then in other exercises of less comfort, and evil mark.

Veni Creator.
^COme holy Ghost eternal God, proceeding from a- ^boue, both from the Father
and the Son, the God of ^peace and love, visit our minds and into us, and
in- to us thy heavenly grace inspire, ^that in all truth and godliness, and
godliness we may have true de- sire.

The humble suit of a sinner.
^O Lord of whom I do de- pend, behold my careful heart, ^and when thy will and
pleasure is, release me of my smart, thou see my ^sorrowes what they are my
grief is known to thee and there is none that can re- ^moue or take the same
from me.

Te Deum.
^WE praise thee God, we knowledge ^thee, the only Lord to be. And ^as eternal
Father all, the earth does worcester- ^ship thee. To thee all Angels cry, to the all
Angels cry, the heavens and all the ^powers therein: To thee Cherub and
Seraphin, to cry they do not linne. to cry they ^do not linne. ^ ^ ^

The song of the three Children.
^O All ye works of God the Lord, of God the ^Lord, bless ye the Lord, bless
ye the Lord, praise ^him and magnify him for ever. ^

Benedictus.
^THe only Lord of Israel, be praised evermore: be ^praysed ever more: For
through his vi- si- ta- ti-on ^and mercy kept in store, his people now he has
redemd, that long has been in ^thrall, and spread a broad his saving health,
upon his servants all. upon his servants all.

Magnificat.
^MY soul does magnify the Lord, my spirit eke ^euermore, rejoices in the
Lord my God which is my sa- ^uiour. And why because he did regard, and gave
respect unto, so base es- ^tate of his handmayd, and let the mighty go. ^

Nunc dimittis.
^O Lord because my hearts desire, has wished ^long to see: My only Lord and
Saui- our, thy ^sonne before I die: The joy and health of all man- ^kind de-
sired long before, which now is come into the world, of mercy bringing ^store.
bringing store. ^

Quicunque vult.
^WHat man soever he be that, what man soever he be ^that salua- ti- on will
at- taine: The Catholic be- ^liefe he must, belief he must, before all things
re- taine. Which Faith unless he ^holy keep, and vndefiledly, and
vndefiledly: Without all doubt eternally, without ^all doubt eternal- ly, he
shall be sure to dye.

The Lamentation of a sinner.
^O Lord turn not away thy face, away thy face, from ^him that lies
prostrate: Lamenting sore, lamenting sore ^his sinful life, before thy mercy
gate, which gate thou openest wide to ^those, which gate thou openest wide to
those, that do lament their sin, shut ^not that gate, shut not that gate
against me Lord, but let me enter in. enter in.

The Lords prayer.
^OVr Father, our Father which in heaven art. Lord hallowed ^be thy name. Thy
kingdom come, Thy kingdom come thy ^will be done, thy will be done in earth,
even as the same in heaven is. Give us O ^Lord our daily bread this day, as we
forgive our debtors so forgive our debts we ^pray. Into temptati- on lead us
not. From evil make us free: for kingdom ^power and glory thine, both now and
ever be, both now and ever be.

The X. Commandments.
^HArke Israel, and what I say,.ij. and what ^I say, give heed to
understand:.ij. I am the Lord thy ^God that brought thee out of Egypt land, of
Egypt land. Even from the house where- ^in thou did, wherein thou did in
thraldom live a slave, in thraldom live a slave. None ^other Gods at all be-
fore, my presence shall thou have, ij. shall thou have.

The complaint of a sinner.
^WHere righteousness does say, Lord for my sinful ^part, Lord for my
sinful part, In wrath thou should me pay, ^vengeance for my desert, I can it
not deny, I can it not deny, but needs I must ^confesse, how that continually
thy laws I do transgress, how that continual- ^ly, thy laws I do transgres,
thy laws I do transgres.

Here begins the Psalms.
Psalm. 1.
^THe man is blessed that has not bent, that has not bent ^to wicked read his
ear, Nor led his life as sinners do, ^nor sat in scorners chair: But in the
law of God the Lord, of God the ^Lord, does set his whole delight, does set his
whole delight, and in that law does ex- ^ercise does exercise himself both
day and night, both day and night, himself both ^day, both day and night.

Psalm. 3.
^O Lord how are my foes increst, how are my ^foes increast, which vex me more
and more? they kill my ^hart when as they say, God can him not restore, God can
him not restore. But ^thou O Lord art my defense, art my defense, when I am
hard bestead: my worship ^and mine honor both, and thou holdst up my head,
holdst up my head.

Psalm. 6. Psalm. 14.
^LOrd in thy wrath re-proue me not, though I deserve thine ^ire: Ne yet
correct me in thy rage, correct me in thy rage, ^O Lord I thee desire. For I am
weak, for I am weak, therefore, O Lord of mercy ^me forebeare, and heal me
Lord, for why thou know, for why thou know my ^bones do quake for fear.
do quake for fear.

^THere is no God as foolish men, ij. as ^foolish men affirm in their mad
mood: their drifts are all cor- ^rupt and vain, corrupt and vain, not one of
them does good. The Lord beheld from ^heauen hye, from heaven hye, the whole
race, the whole race of mankind: And ^saw not one, and saw not one that sought
in deed, the living God to find.

Psalm. 18.
^O God my strength and fortitude, O ^God my strength and for- titude of force
I ^must love thee: thou art my castle and defense my ^castle and defense in my
necessity. My God my rock in whom I trust, in whom I ^trust, My God my rock
in whom I trust, in whom I trust, the worker of my wealth, ^of my wealth, my
refuge buckler and my shield, my refuge bukler and my ^shield, the horn of all
my health.

Psalm. 21.
^O Lord how joyful is the king, how joyful ^is the king, in thy strength and
thy power? How ^vehemently does he rejoice, does he rejoice, ^in thee his Saui-
our? For thou have given unto him, have given unto him, ^his godly hearts
desire: To him nothing have thou denide, of that he did require. ^

Psalm 23.
^MY Sheapheard is the living Lord, the living Lord, no- ^thing therefore I
need: In pastures fair, in pastures ^faire with waters calm, he set me for
to feed. he set me for to feed. ^

Psalm. 25.
^I Lift mine heart to thee, mine heart to thee, my ^God and guide most just,
guide most just: Now suffer ^me, now suffer me to take no shame, for in thee
do I trust, do I trust. Let ^not my foes rejoice, let not my foes re- joyce,
nor make a scorn of me: And ^let them not be overthrown, and let them not be
overthrown, that put their ^trust in thee.

Psalm. 25. An other of the same.
^I Lift mine heart to thee, my God and guide most ^iust, and guide most just:
Now suffer me to take no ^shame, to take no shame, for in thee do I trust. for
in thee do I trust. ^ ^

Psalm. 30
^ALL laud and praise with heart and voice, All ^laud and praise with heart and
voice, O Lord I give ^to thee: which did not make my foes rejoice, my foes
rejoice, but have ex- ^alted me, O Lord my God to thee I cride, in all my
pain and grief, thou ^gauest an ear, thou gave an ear and did provide,
to ease me with re- ^liefe. with relief. ^

Psalm 41.
^THe man is blessed that careful is, The man is ^blest that careful is, the
needy to consider: For ^in the season perilous, the Lord will him deliver. The
Lord will make him ^safe and sound, will make him safe and sound, and happy in
the land, and happy ^in the land, and he will not deliver him, deliver him, in
to his enemies hand.

Psalm. 44.
^OVr ears have heard our fathers tell, our ^fathers tell, and reverently re-
cord: the wondrous ^works that thou have done, have done, that thou have ^done
in older time O Lord. How thou did cast the Gentiles out, and stroydst them
^with strong hand, planting our fathers in their place, and gave to them
their ^land, to them their land.

Psalm. 46.
^THe Lord is our defense and aid, the ^strength whereby we stand, when we with
woe are ^much dismayed, he is our help at hand. Though thearth remove we will
not ^feare, though thearth remove we will not fear, though hills so high and
steep: ^be thrust and hurled here and theere, within the Sea so deep.

Psalm. 50.
^THe mighty God, theternall has thus spoke, theter- ^nall has thus spoke,
and all the world he will call and pro- ^uoke, even from the East, and so
forth to the West, ij. From toward Sion ^which place him likes best, him
likes best, God will appear in beauty most excel- ^le^t, most excellent. Our
God will come before yt long time be spent. long time be spent.

Psalm. 50. An other of the same.
^THe God of Gods the Lord has called the earth by ^name: From where the Sun,
From where the Sun does ^rise, unto the setting of the same. From Sion his
fair place, his fair place, his glo- ^rie, bright and clear: The perfect
beauty of his grace, from thence it did appear. ^

Psalm. 51.
^O Lord consider my distress, consider my distress, and ^now with speed
some pity take, My sins deface, my ^faults redress, my faults redress,
good Lord for thy great mercies sake. Wash ^me (O Lord,) wash me O Lord and
make me clean, from this unjust and sinful ^act: and sinful act: and purify
yet once again, my heinous crime and bloody ^fact. and bloody fact.

Psalm. 52.
^WHy do thou tyrant boast abroad, thy wicked works to ^praise? thy wicked
works to praise? do thou not know there ^is a God, whose mercies last always?
Why does thy mind yet still devise, such ^wicked wiles to warpe? Thy tongue
untrue in forging lies, in forging lies, is ^like a rasour sharp.

Psalm. 59.
^SEnd aid and save me from my foes, O Lord I pray to ^thee: Defend and keep
me, Defend and keep me from all ^those, that rise and strive with me. O Lord
preserve me from those men, me from those ^men, preserve me from those men,
whose doings are not good: And set me sure, and ^safe from them, that still
thirst after blood. that still thirst after blood.

Psalm. 61.
^REgard (O Lord) for I complain, and make my ^sute to thee: and make my suit
to thee: Let not my words re- ^turne in vain, Let not my words return in
vain, but give an ear to me. From ^of the coasts and utmost parts, from of
the coasts and utmost parts, of all the earth a- ^broad: of all the earth
abroad: In grief and anguish of my heart, and anguish ^of my heart, I cry to
thee O God. to thee (O God.)

Psalm. 68.
^LEt God arise and then his foes, Let God arise and the^ his ^foes, will turn
them selves to flight: His enmies then will ^runne abroad, will run abroad, and
scatter out of sight. And as the fire does melt the ^wax, does melt the wax,
and wind blow smoke away: so in the presence of the ^Lord, the presence of the
Lord, the wicked shall decay. shall decay.

Psalm. 69.
^SAue me O God and that with speed, and that with ^speed, the waters flow
full fast: the waters flow full fast: so any my soul do they proceed, do they
proceed, that I am sore aghast. I stick full deep in ^filth and clay, whereas I
feel no ground, I fall into such floods I say, that I am like be ^drownd. that
I am like be drowned.

Psalm. 72.
^LOrd give thy judgments to the King, Lord give thy ^iudgements to the king,
therein instruct him well: instruct him ^well: And with his son, and with his
son that princely thing, Lord let thy justice ^dwell. That he may govern
uprightly, govern uprightly, and rule thy folk aright, and ^rule thy folk
aright, And so defend through equity, through equity, the poor that ^haue no
might* the poor that have no might, that have no might.

Psalm. 77.
^I With my voice to God do cry, with heart and hearty ^cheare: with heart and
hearty cheer: My voice to God, my ^voyce to God I lift on hie, and he my suit
does hear. In time of grief I ^sought to God, I sought to God, by night no
rest I took: But stretched my ^hands to him abroad, to him abroad, my Soul
comfort forsook. comfort forsook.

Psalm. 78.
^ATtend my people to my law, and to my words incline: and ^to my words
incline: My mouth shall speak: My mouth shall ^speake strange parables, and

The Lamentation. The church tune.
^O Lord in thee is all my trust, give ear unto my woeful ^crye: Refuse me not

The former Book of the Music of M. William Damon, late one of her majesty's
Musitions: containing all the tunes of David's Psalms, as they are ordinarily
soung in the Church: most excellently by him composed into 4. parts. In which
Set the Tenor sings the Church tune.

Published for the recreation of such as delight in Music: By W. Swayne Gent.

Printed by T. Este, the assign of W. Byrd. 1591.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable, Sir William Cecill Knight, Baron of Burghley, Lord
high Treasorer of England. William Swayne wishes long life, and the same to be
most healthie and happy.
RIght Honorable my singular good Lord, there came to my hands of late a book
containing all the tunes of the Psalms, as they are ordinarily soung in the
Church, composed into four parts by M. William Damon late one of her Majesty's
servant, which book being found not only in my poor opinion, but in the
riper judgment of some special Musicions to be excellently set, either to
serve for ^oices or instruments: for the great use that might come thereof, and
partly to preserve the labors of the Auctor, so worthy and skillfull a man
in his profession: also to leave his Religion and piety herein witnessed, that
so carefully and specially labored to advance the use of singing the
Psalms: I was earnestly dealt with all not to deteyne that as a part of my
private store in Music, that of it self contained matter so worthy
publicly to enterteyne and to receive enterteynment. Therefore with their
persuasions and reasons, I was brought to publish them for the use and comfort
of all, especially of the godly. And now right honorable my very good Lord,
calling to mind the duty, honor, and service due by me unto your good
Lordship, for the great love and favor which I have always received at your
L. hands. (For I acknowledge my self to none more bound then to your honor:) I
have been the more emboldened to present this simple work to pass under your
L. favor and protection. Wishing that the same may chiefly serve to the
glory and praise of God. And then at your L. pleasure, at some times for the
recreation of your mind, after your worthy and great travail from day to day
taken in the most weighty affairs of this common wealth. And so I commend
your good L. to the merciful keeping of thalmightie God.

Your good L. most bound during life, William Swayne.

To the Reader.
HEretofore gentle Reader, M. William Damon one of her Majesty's Musitions,
being earnestly requested by a friend of his did at sundry times when he
resorted to his friends house compose the tunes of David's Psalms as they are
ordinarily soung in the Church note for note, intending the^ for his friends
private use. These Psalms so set, and made without labor or purpose to
publish them, were notwithstanding published by the same friend of M. Damon;
which not answering thexpectation that many had of the Auctors skill, gave him
occasion to take upon him a new labor to recover the wrong his friend did in
publishing that that was so done, as might well please him, but was not
purposed or framed for the learned ears of our times. Therefore at his best
leisure and fittest times he composed the same tunes again in so excellent a
manner that by comparison of these and the former, the Reader may by trial see
that the Auctor could not receive in his Art such a note of disgrace by his
friends oversight before, but that now the same is taken away, and his worthy
knowledge much more graced by this second travail. Now to acquaynt thee with
the Auctors order in this second work, he has for variety gone through the
Psalms twice, which are now divided into two Setts: whereof in the former the
ordinary singing part is carried in the Tenor: In the second set it is conveyed
in the highest part. Herein there is required of the Reader, if he be a lover of
Music, that he would accept of their labor that have taken pains in
publishing exactlie a work of such singular skill, and special use for them,
that after the serious labor of their calling are desirous rather to recreate
them selves in singing of Psalms, then in other exercises of less comfort,
and evil mark.

Veni Creator.
^COme ho- ly Ghost eternal God, proceeding from above, ^both from the Father
and the Son, the God of peace ^and love, visit our minds and into us, and
into us, thy heavenly grace inspire, ^that in all truth and godliness, we may
have true desire.

The humble suit of a sinner.
^O Lord of whom I do depend, behold my careful heart, and ^when thy will and
pleasure is, release me of my smart, thou see my sorrows what they ^are my
grief is known to thee, and there is none that can remove or take the ^same
from me.

Te Deum.
^WE praise thee God, we knowledge ^thee, the only Lord to be. And as eternal
Father ^all the earth does worship thee. To thee all Angels cry, the heavens
and ^all the powers therein: To thee Cherub and Seraphin, to cry they do not
linne.

The song of the three Children.
^O All ye works of God the Lord, bless ^ye the Lord, bless ye the Lord,
praise him ^and magnify him for ever. ^

Benedictus.
^THe only Lord of Israel, be praised ever- ^more: For through his vi- si-
ta- ti-on and mercy ^kept in store, his people now he has redemd, that long
has been in thrall, ^and spread abroad his saving health, upon hi^ servants
^ll. ^ ^ ^ ^

Magnificat.
^MY soul does magnify the Lord, my spirit eke ^euermore, rejoices in the
Lord my God which is my ^sauiour. And why because he did regard, and gave
respect unto, so base estate of ^his handmayd, and let the mighty go.

Nunc dimittis.
^O Lord because my hearts desire, has wished long to ^see: My only Lord and
Savior, thy son before I die: ^The joy and health of all mankind desired
long before, which now is ^come into the world, of mercy bringing store.

Quicunque vult.
^WHat man soever he be that sal- uation ^will attain: The catholic, the
catholic belief he ^must be- fore all things retain. Which Faith unless he
holy keep he ^holy keep, he holy keep, and vndefiledly: Without all doubt
eter- ^nally he shall be sure to dye. ^ ^ ^ ^

The Lamentation of a sinner.
^O Lord turn not away thy face, from him that ^lyeth prostrate: Lamenting
sore, lamenting sore his sinful ^lyfe, before thy mercy gate, before thy mercy
gate, which gate thou openest ^wide to those, thou openest wide to those that
do lament their sin, their ^sinne, shut not that gate against me Lord, but
let me enter in, but let me enter in.

The Lords prayer.
^OVr Father which in heaven art. Lord hallowed be ^thy name. Thy kingdom
come, thy kingdom come, thy ^will be done in earth even as the same in heaven
is. Give us O ^Lord our daily bread this day, as we forgive our detters so,
forgive our ^debts we pray. Into temptation lead us not. From evil make us
free: for kingdom ^power and glory thine, both now and ever be, both now and
ever be.

The X. Commandments.
^HArke Israel, and what I say, and what I say, give heed to ^vnderstand: give
heed to understand, I am the Lord thy ^God that brought thee out of Egypt land.
Even from the house wherein thou did ^Euen from the house wherein thou did
in thraldom live a slave. None other Gods at ^all before, at all before my
presence shall thou have my presence shall thou have.

The complaint of a sinner.
^WHere righteousness, where righteous- nesse does ^say, Lord for my sinful
part, Lord for my sinful part, ^In wrath thou should me pay, vengeance for
my desert, I can it not deny, but ^needes I must confess, but needs I must
confess, how that con- tinually, ^how that continually, thy laws I do
transgres, thy laws I do transgres.

Here begins the Psalms.
Psalm. 1.
^THe man is blessed that has not bent, to wicked ^rede his ear, Nor led his
life as sinners do, nor sat in ^scorners chair: But in the law of God the
Lord, of God the Lord, does set his ^whole delight, does set his whole delight,
and in that law does exercise him- ^selfe both day and night, himself both
day and night.

Psalm. 3.
^O Lord how are my foes increast how ^are my foes increast, which vex me more
and ^more? they kill my heart when as they say, ^God can him not restore. But
thou O Lord art my defense, when I am ^hard bestead: my worship and mine honor
both, and thou holdst up my ^head. and thou holdst up my head.

Psalm. 6.
^LORD in thy wrath reprove me not, reprove me not, ^though I deserve thine
ire: Ne yet correct me in thy rage, O ^Lord, I thee desire, I thee desire. For
I am weak, therefore O Lord of mercy ^me forbear, and heal me Lord, for why?
thou know, my bones do quake for fear. ^my bones do quake for fear.

Psalm. 14.
^THere is no God as foolish men, as foolish men af- ^firme in their mad mood,
affirm in their mad mood: ^their driftes are all corupt and vain, corupt and
vain, not one of them does good. ^The Lord beheld from heaven hye, from heaven
hye, the whole race, the whole race ^of mankind: And saw not one, and saw not
one that sought in deed the living ^God to find.

Psalm. 18.
^O God my strength and fortitude, and fortitude, of ^force I must love thee:
thou art my castle and de- ^fence, my castle and defense, in my necessity* My
God my rock, My God my ^rocke in whom I trust, My God my rock, my rock, in
whom I trust, the worker ^of my wealth, My refuge buckler and my shield, buck:
etc. the horn of all my health.

Psalm. 21.
^O Lord how joyful is the king, O Lord how joyful ^is the king, in thy
strength and thy power? How vehement- ^ly does he rejoice, does he rejoice, in
thee his Savior? For thou have given unto ^him, his godly hearts desire: To him
no- thing have thou denide, have thou de- ^nide of that he did require. ^

Psalm. 23.
^MY Sheapheard is the living Lord, the living Lord, no- ^thing therefore I
need, therefore I need: In pastures ^faire, in pastures fair with waters
calm he set me for to feed. he set me ^for to feed. ^

Psalm. 25.
^I Lift mine heart to thee, my God and guide most ^iust: Now suffer me to take
no shame, to take no ^shame, for in thee do I trust, do I trust. Let not my
foes rejoice, ^nor make a scorn of me: and let them not and let them not be
over- ^throwne, that put their trust in thee.

Psalm. 25. An other of the same.
^I Lift mine heart to thee, mine heart to thee, my ^God and guide most just: Now
suffer me to take no ^shame, to take no shame, for in thee do I trust, for in
the do I trust. ^ ^

Psalm. 30
^ALL laud and praise with heart and voice, with ^hart and voice, O Lord I give
to thee, I give to ^thee: which did not make my foes rejoice, my foes
rejoice, but have ex- ^alted me: O Lord my God to thee I cride, in all my pain
and grief, ^thou gave an ear and did provide, to ease me with relief. ^

Psalm. 41.
^THe man is blessed that careful is, that careful is, the ^needy, the needy to
consider: For in the season peri- ^lous, the Lord will him deliver. The Lord
will (...) him safe and sound, ^and happy in the land, and happy in the land,
and he will not de- li- uer ^him, deliver him, in to his enemies hand,

Psalm 44.
^OVr ears have heard our fathers tell, our fathers tell, ^and reverently
record: the wondrous works that thou have ^done, that thou have done, in older
time O Lord, How thou did cast the gentiles ^out, and stroydst them with
strong hand, Planting our fathers in their place and ^gauest to them their
land. and gave to them their land. ^

Psalm. 46. The Church tune.
^THe Lord is our defense and aid, the ^strength whereby we stand, when we with
woe are ^much dismayed, he is our help at hand. Though thearth remove we will
not fear, ^though hills so high and steep. Be thrust and hurled here and there
with- ^in the Sea so deep.

Psalm. 50.
^THe mighty God, theternall has thus spoke, and ^all the world he will call
and provoke even from the ^East, and so forth to the West, and so forth to
the West. From toward Sion which ^place him likes best, which place him likes
best, God will appear in beauty most ^excelle^t. Our God will come before ye
long time be spent* that long time be spent.

Psalm. 50. An other of the same.
^THe God of Gods the Lord has called the earth, has ^cald the earth by name:
From where the Sun does ^rise, unto the setting of the same. From Sion, from
Sion his fair place, his glo- ^rie bright and clear: The perfect beauty of
his grace, beauty of his grace, from ^thence it did appear.

Psalm 51.
^O Lord consider my distress, and now with ^speede some pity take, My sins
deface, my faults redress, ^good Lord for thy great mercies sake, great
mercies sake. Wash me (O ^Lord) wash me O Lord, and make me clean, and make me
clean, from this un- ^iust and sinnfull act: and purify yet once again, my
heinous crime my ^hainous crime and bloody fact.

Psalm. 52.
^WHy do thou tyrant boast abroad, thy wicked ^workes to praise? do thou
not know there is a God, whose ^mercies last always? Why does thy mind yet
still devise, yet still devise, such ^wicked wiles to warpe? Thy tongue untrue
in forging lies, in forging lies, is ^like a rasour sharp.

Psalm. 59.
^SEnd aid and save me from my foes, and save me from my ^foes, O Lord I pray
to thee: Defend and keep, De- ^fend and keep me from all those, that rise and
strive with me. O Lord pre- ^serue me from those men, whose doings are not
good: And set me sure and ^safe from them that still thirst after blood, that
still thirst after blood. ^

Psalm. 61.
^REgard (O Lord) for I complain, and make my ^sute to thee: Let not my words,
Let not my words re- ^turne in vain, but give an ear to me. From of the
coasts and utmost parts, and ^vtmost parts, of all the earth abroad: In grief
and anguish of my heart, ^and anguish of my heart, I cry to thee (O God.)

Psalm. 68.
^LEt God arise and then his foes, Let God arise and ^then his foes, will turn
the^ selves to flight: His enmies ^then will run a broad, will run abroad,
and scatter out of sight. And as the ^fire does melt the wax, does melt the
wax, and wind blow smoke away: So ^in the presence of the Lord, the wicked
shall decay. the wicked shall decay.

Psalm. 69.
^SAue me O God and that with speed, and that with ^speed, the waters flow
full fast: so ny my soul do they pro- ^ceed, do they proceed, that I am sore
aghast. I stick full deep in filth and clay, in ^filth and clay, whereas I feel
no ground, I fall into such floods I say, that I am ^like be drowned. that I am
like be drowned.

Psalm. 72.
^LORD give thy judgments to the King, therein in- ^struct him well: instruct
him well: And with his son that ^princely thing, Lord let thy justice dwell.
That he may govern uprightly, and ^rule thy folk aright: and rule thy folk a
right: and so defend through equity through ^equitie, the poor that have no
might. the poor that have no might. ^

Psalm. 77.
^I With my voice to God do cry, to God do cry, with ^hart and hearty cheer:
with heart and hearty cheer: ^My voice to God I lift on hie, and he my suit
does hear. In time of grief ^I sought to God, I sought to God, by night no
rest I took: But stretched my ^hands to him abroad, my soul comfort forsook.
comfort forsook.

Psalm* 78.
^ATtend my people to my law, and to my words in- ^cline My mouth shall speak
strange parables, strange para- ^bles and sentences divine. Which we our
selves have hard and learnd. even ^of our fathers old: and which for our
instruction, instruction, our fathers have us told. ^

Psalm. 81.
^BE light and glad, be light and glad in God rejoice, ^which is our strength
and stay: which is our strength and ^stay: Be joyful and lift up your voice,
to Jacobs God I say. Prepare your instru- ^ments most meet, some joyful
Psalm to sing, strike up with Harp and Lute so ^sweete, on every pleasant
string. ^ ^

Psalm. 88.
^LOrd God of health, the hope and stay, thou ^art alone to me: I call and cry
throughout the day, through- ^out the day, and all the night to thee. O let my
prayers soon ascend, unto thy ^sight on hye: Incline thine ear O Lord, entend
and harken to my cry.

Psalm. 100.

Psalm. 104.

greatness may see, the heavens in such sort thou ^also have spread, that it to
a curtain, compared may be. com-pared may be.
