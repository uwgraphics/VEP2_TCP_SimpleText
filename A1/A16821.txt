A new Ballad, composed in commendation of the Society, or Company of the
Porters.
To the tune of, In Edenbrugh, behold.
At the first went we, as here you see. But since our Corporation, on this
fashion. And to our Hall, thus we go all.


Thrice blessed is that Land
where King and Rulers be.
and men of great Command
that careful are to see,
(...)
(...)
is unto all extended
rich, poor, both great and small,
are by his care defended.
As plainly does appear,
by that was lately done,
for them that burdens b^are,
and do on business run:
the Porters of this City,
so^e being men of Trade,
but now the more, the more the pity
by crosses are decade.
Yet bearing honest minds,
their charge for to maintain,
as Gods command them ^indes,
with travel and with pain:
they all have wisely joined,
for that they have effected,
their company to Linde
and make it more respected.
Now they that were before
of meanest estimation,
by suite have sa^ude that sore,
and gainde a Corporation:
excludes, and shuts out many
that were of base esteem,
and will not suffer any
such person bide with them.
But such as well are known,
and honest Acts embrace:
among them they will have none
that have no biding place:
among them they will have none
(as near as they can find)
but such as well are known
to bear an honest mind.
For now unto their hall
they pay their quarteridge ^owne,
attending masters call,
and fearing masters frown,
there seeking for redress
and right if they have wrong,
there, they that do trangresse
have that to them does long.
(...)
(...)
then that they had before,
when as the malefactor
was on a coultstaffe bore:
for the owner it is much better,
but for the offender worse,
to taste this new made order,
then ride a wooden horse.
That shame was soon slipped over,
soon in oblivion drownde,
and then again, another
would in like fault be found:
not caring for their credit,
and trust another time,
this orders therefore as a bit
to hold them from that crime.
They that are rash, and rude,
and obstinately run
as their own wills conclude,
and cannot well be won
to condescend, and stand
to orders they have made,
by the Rulers out of hand,
have f^^es upon them laid.
All iarres and braules are bard
that among them might arise,
first commer, first is serude,
where as a burden lies,
if one be ready there
he must his profit take:
all other must forbear
and no resistance make.
Such as have long bin known
to use this bearing trade,
and into years are grown,
(so that their strengths decade)
they can no longer labor
as they have done before,
the Company does succo^r
and maintain evermore.
These and a many more
good orders they have, sure,
to make rude fellows know
their stoutnesse, does procure.
but their own detriment
(...)
(...)
but things will be amiss
as often it has bin known,
the number of them is,
a thousand forty one.
They all met together.
m^st hansomely arayde,
at Christ church, to hear there
a sermon, for them made.
There marks of Admittaince
made out of tin, they ba^e
about their necks in ribbons:
the chief, of silver wear.
To have seen them so, you'^ wonder,
so many should maintain
themselves, by such a labor,
but that, that's got with pain,
God does increase and bless:
for good himself has sed,
with pain and weariness,
we all should get our bread.
Thus therefore I conclude,
more happy men are they,
then many that delude
the world, and bear away
the sweet of poor men's labor
their chests to cram and stuff,
not caring for Gods favor,
so they have gold enough.
Our royal King and Queen
thou King of Kings defend,
as thou to them have been
most merciful and kind:
thy love to them increase,
bless all they undertake:
His Counsels counsel, bless,
even for thy dear sons sake.
Tho. Brewer.
