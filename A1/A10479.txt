TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL THE true favorers of Music, and all virtue Mr.
Thomas Rauenscroft, and Mr. William Rauenscroft Esquires.
RIght Worshipful, I have been so much obliged to the courteous regard you
have always had of me, that if I should not owe unto you my best endeavors; I
should much contrary your kindnesses, and deservedly incur the shame of
ingratitude: Let it therefore stand with your good likings, that by these
harmless Musical Phansies, I may show unto the world, and hereby confess,
how much I am bound unto you; and when it shall further seem good to your
Worships to command me, I will not have ability or life that shall not be at
your service.

You may well perceive by the much variety herein composed, that my desire is
to give contentment in this kind of Music to the skillful, and most
judicious of all sorts. And being little or much beholding to some of each
rank, I study and strive to please you in your own elements. Now if my
pains prove your pleasures, you shall still keep me in pains to please you.
And so I rest yours.
