NEVVES FROM SCOTLAND Being two Copies, the one, a proclamation of the king:
the other a protestation against it, by the Noble men, Barons: and Ministers of
Scotland, both published at Edenburrough the 22 day of Febr: 1638
CHARLES etc.

For so much as we out of our princely care of maintaning the true religion
all ready professed, and so beating down all superstition: Having ordained a
book of common prayer to be compiled for the general and universal use and
edification of our subjects within our ancient kingdom of Scotland, the same
being accordingly don. In the framing whereof we took great care and pains so
that there is nothing past therein but what was seen and approved by us before
the same was divulgated or printed: assuring all our loving subjects that not
only our intention is, but even this very book a ready means to maintain the
true religion already professed, and beat out all superstition, of which we
in our own time do not doubt but in a fair course to satisfy the judgments
of our good subjects: But having seen and considered some petitions and
declarations given into our counsel against the said Book and late CANNONS of
the book, find our regal authority much injured thereby, both in the matter
and the carrage, whereby we certefie these of the Nobility, gentry, Barrons
Ministers and others who have kept and assisted those meetings and convocations
for contriving and subscribing of the said petitions, to be liable to our high
censure, both in their persons and fortunes, they having conveyned themselves
without our consent or authority: Yet because we believe that they have done
herein only out of a preposterous zeal, and without any disloyalty or
disaffectito our Soueraingty: Our gracious plea^ure (so far as concerns those
meetings for consulting and subscribing of the said petitions or presenting of
the same to any judge or judges within this kingdom) is to dispense therewith,
and with what may be the fault or error therein, to all such as upon
signification or declaration of this our pleasure, shall retein themselves as
become good and dutiful subjects. To which purpose OUR WILL is henceforth, and
we charge you streaghtly and command that incontimently these our letters
seen, the particulers and in our name and authority proclamation thereof be
made to all our liege subjects in all places needful; that so ^one pretend
ignorance hereof, and therewithal in our name and authority that ye discharge
all such convocations and meetings in time to come, under the penalty of
treason and also that ye command, charge and inhibit all our leiges and
subjects, that none of them on any hand presume to resort or repair to the
Borough of Starling, nor to any other Borough, where our counsel and Session
sits, till first they declare the cause of their coming to our counsel, and
declare their warrant to that effect: And further that we command and charge
all and sundry Provosts, Bayleifes, and Magistrates within their bourroughs
that they, and every one of them have a special care and regard, to see this
our royal will and pleasure readyly and dutifully observed in all points, and
that noe violence be suffered within your bounds, under all the highest
penalty, crime or offense that they may commit against us in that behalf: And
also that ye cammaund and charge all and sundry Noblemen, Barons and Burgesses
who are not actual indwellers within the Borough, neither are of number of
the privy counsel and Session; and members thereof, and are already within
this Borough: that they and every one of them remove themselves, and depart
and pass forth of the said Borough (and not return again without the said
warrant) within the space of six hours after the publication hereof, under the
said penalty of treason: And as concerning any petitions that shall hereafter
be given to us, upon this or any other subject: we are likewise pleased to
declare that we will not shut our ears there from: so it be not prejudicial
to our royal authority.

Given at starling under our signet the 19 of Febr. 1638 Per actum Dominorum
Consilij.

THE KINGS PROCLAMATION Being Proclaimed, the protestation here follovving
against it, was at the same instance in the open street publicly read.
WE the Noble men, Barons and Ministers appointed to attend his majesty's
answer unto our humble petitions, and to present our greeuiances, and to do
what else might lawfully conduce to our humble desires. Did upon the 13 of
September last, present one supplication to your Lordships; and another upon
the 18 of October following: as also a new bill relativelie to the former in
December after the 19 day.

In all which, we humbly remonstrated, our just exceptions against the Service
book, and Book of Cannons, Archbishops and Bishops of this kingdom, as the
contrivers, meanteaners and urgers thereof; and against their sitting as our
Judges until the causes between them and us be decided.

And withal we earnestly supplicated to be ridd and delivered from these
evils, and from all other innovations of that kind, introducted against the
laudable laws of this kingdom: as namely that of the high Commssion and other
evils particularly and generally mentioned in our supplications and complaints:
And that these our parties, delinquent against our religion and laws might be
taken order with, and these pressing greeviances be redressed, according to the
laws of this realm, as in our supplications we have more largely expressed,
the which we gave into your Lordships upon the 19 of December aforesaid,
against the Archbishops and Bishohs our parties, who by consequence therefore
neither could be, nor may be our Judges.

Whereupon your Lordships declared by your act given at Dealkeeth the said 19
of December, that you would present our petition to his majesty's royal
consideration, and that without any prejudice to us the said supplicants, and
moreover that we should be heard, in time and place convenient, and in the
mean time we should receive no prejudice as the said act it self testifies for
us.

Now where as we your humble supplicants (with long patience and hope grounded
upon sundry promises) were exspecting an answer unto our fore named humble
desires, we understood of some direction from his majesty, to you the Lords of
his highness privy counsel, touching our complaints: and upon the same admitted
the consulting and judging both, of our supplication, and the kings answer
there to, unto the Archbishops and Bishops our direct par-ties: Contrary to
our Protestation given in at Dealkeeth, and since renewed at Starling: and
contrary to your Lordships foresaid act made at Dealkeeth.

Least therefore our silence should be prejudicial to this so importunate a
cause, as concerns Gods glory and worship, our religion and salvation, the
laws and liberties of this kingdom: or deregatory to our former supplications
and complaints: or in breife, not answerable to the trust of our commission: we
are forced out of our bounden duty to God, our king and native cuntry to take
instument in the notaries and Clerks hands (seeing your Lordships refuse to
admit our Declimiter for remoueall these of our parties) and to protest in
manner following.

1. We protest that we may and ought to have an immediate course to present
our just greeviances to out sacred Soverainge, and in a legal way and manner
to prosecute the same, before the ordinary and competent judges, civil or
Eccleasticall; without any offense either offered by us, or taken by your
Lordships. 2. We protest that the Arch-bish^^^ and Bishops the parties whom
we complain upon, cannot be reputed or esteemed lawful judges, to sit in
indicatory within this kingdom civil or Ecclesiastical, upon any of us the
said supplicants, until they do by lawful trial iudiciously purge
themselves of such crimes as we have already laid to their charge: offering our
selves to prove the same whenever his majesty shall be pleased to give us
audience. 3. We protest that no act or proclamation, whether paid or here
after shall pass, in the counsel, and by the states of Archb. and Bishops
(our parties and whom we have declyned to be our Judges) shall in no wise be
prejudicial to us, that is, either to our persons, our lawful meetings,
proceedings and persuits. 4. We protest that neither our selves, nor any
others, whose hearts the Lord shall move to join with us in our supplications
against the aforesaid innovocations, shall incur any danger, either in life,
lands, or any political or Ecclesiastical penalty: For not observing such
acts, Books, Canons, Writts, judicatories and proclamations introduced
without, or against the acts of parliament, or statutes of this kingdom. But
it shall be lawful for us and them to use our selves in matters of religion, or
the external worship of God, and policy of the Church; according to the word
of God, and the laudable constitutions of this Church and kingdom. 5. Seeing
all such as have taken these innovations to heart, have by a legal and
submissive way of supplications sought redress and been calm and quiet in
hope of reformation: We protest therefore that if inconvenience shall happen to
fall out (which we pray God to prevent) upon the pressing of the said
innovations or evils, generally and specially mentioned in our former
complaints, and upon your Lordships refusal, to take order for redress. That
the same shall not be imputed unto us, who most humbly desire to have all
things redressed by order. 6. We protest before God, the Heavens, and the
Angels, that these our Requests (proceeding from conscience, and our due
respect to his Majesty's honor) do tend to no other end, but to the
preservation of the true reformed religion, the Laws and Liberties of his
Majesty's most ancient Kingdom, and the satisfaction of our humble desires
contained in our supplications, according to his Majesty's goodness and
justice; From whom we do certainly exspect, that his sacred Majesty will
proceed and grant remedy to our just petions and complaints: as may be
exspected from so gracious a King toward his loyal and dutiful Subjects,
calling for redress of so oppressing greevances, praying heartily that his
Majesty may long and prosperously reign over us.
Amen
