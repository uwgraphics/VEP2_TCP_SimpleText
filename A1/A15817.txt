Read but not deride,
Accuse not without cause:
Such hasty doom accords not
With reason, nor her Laws.

Imprinted by John Wolf, dwelling in Distaffe Lane, near unto the Sign of
the Castle.

TO THE WORSHIPFVL, his approved good Master, and Friend, Master Henry
Reynolles, Esquire.
ESpying by apparent show (worshipful Sir) the great good will you bear
unto those that aba^don idleness, and apply themselves to some kind of
exercise, where, by often frequenting, it may bring unto them (hereafter) such
praise and profit, as they shall have singular occasion to pray for those
friends, which lend them aid in the same. It is not material to amplify, or
gloss unto such, whose judgment is universal, whose foresight in matters,
has great foreshewe of silent interpretation. I am to crave at your worshippes
hands, three things. First, not to condemn my boldness. Secondly, not to
repulse my rudeness. And thirdly, to accept my simple good will, who wrote
this with as zealous affection, as ever Paris bare unto fair Helena. This
simple piece, which by my simpl^ industry I have pe^ned, is utterly void of
eloquence: For why, it was never (as yet) my chance to have any conversation,
where such society accompanied together. For Pallas will not be seen to
intermeddle her self where Pan so peartly preaceth in place. I am perchance
too tedious unto your worship, and make a long Oration unto little effect.
But as a shameless crauer has not the civility to make an end: So I the
skilles writer have not the perseverance of enough. I therefore to be short,
make this my present unto you, entitled, The Castle of Courtesy, whereunto is
adjoined, The Houlde of Humility, a matter not so worthy, as you are worthy
to be a Patron off. But fame has so spread your courtesy and humility, your
civility and humanity, as it abasheth me to speak: because I want the skill
according. I beseech your worship not to weigh the work but the will: not the
matter but the maker: who vvil during life, rest at your commandment,
vvishing unto your vvorshippe with unfeigned faith, your hearts request (in
what soever,) and eternal felicity in the world to come, Amen.

Your worshippes servant daily at commandment: James Yates.
Verses on his name
He merits praise, who virtuous life does lead,
Experience shows the bounty of his mind:
Neglecting not, if he may stand in stead,
Readily pressed his friendly aid to find.
In time of need be stays not his hand:
Regarding those which in distress do stand.
Excluding coyness from his courteous breast,
If Favor fail, in him it may be found:
Not skornefullie the simple to detest,
Or with disdain his phrase of speech to sound:
With modesty he meekelie marks the ground,
Looking into true meaning of the heart:
Such as it is, he takes it in good part.
FINIS.
James Yates Seruingman, to the Courteous and Friendly Reader.
IF my request may stand in stead,
to crave this at thy hand:
Then let (I pray) with courtesy,
this simple work be skande ^
My pain is for to pleasure thee,
ungrateful do not seem:
Least that thou do discourage me,
if skoffingly thou deem.
This skillesse work which I commi^
unto the open view
of those, whose upright meaning is
inclyned to be true:
I boldly venture to present
a^ one that has good will.
To gratify those that deserve,
though simple be my skill.
Presuming that all Zoilus sect,
are sunk, and under ground,
And that there are no SICOPHANTES,
(I hope) for to be found:
But such as rather will amend,
five faults ere they find one.
O Lord it were a golden world,
if SICOPHANTES were gone.
I cannot cover nor conceal,
the fruits that I do gain:
But publicly must them display,
though they be base and plain.
And as by tracte of time we see,
rare matters work effect:
So I in time may chance on choice,
some better to selecte.
In mean time my request is thus,
accept these as they be:
And you perchance ere it be long,
shall have some more of me.
Which better shall content conceit,
receive these as the first:
Good words (they say) as soon are said,
as are the vile and worst.
Farewell.
The Author to his Book.
I Stand in doubt that some dispitefull mat^
Will closely carpe, concealing no dispraise:
But in contempt of thee and of thy state,
Will go about discredit for to raise,
To seek and search by all the means they may:
Thy true intent to murder and to slay.
But see thou seem obedient and mild,
Beak thou and bend, no hautinesse do hau^t:
Confess the truth, thy Author is a child,
Who wants wit, and so thou may them grant.
Yet willingness should be esteemed as well:
As those whose phrase does seem for to excel.
No, no, not so, therein you do digress,
The pregnant pate does purchase all the praise,
Whose fluent vain does make the mind apresse,
By deep delight alluering always
Attentive ears to listen and to bark
What such repeat (me thinks) I see them mark^.
Alas my book, thou art not for their frame,
Thy skiliesnesse must trouble no such place:
Be patient although thou suffer blame,
And be content though girded with disgrace,
I am disposed, to deem of thee what dout
Thou shall sustain by this thy going out.
Yet when I had perfectionated thee,
And brought to pass that which was somes desire:
Send it abroad, they straight ways said to me,
My friend unsained, of you we do require.
I ready was withouten stay or stint:
To give them leave thee for to put in p^int.
FINIS.
The Book to the Author.
WHat do you mean (I pray)
Such kind of speech to say?
Doubtfully to display
What shall of me insu^
There Is none will go about,
To mock or for to floute:
Except it be some loute,
Of trothe I tell you true.
And as for such as those,
The truth for to disclose,
I cannot feign ne gloss,
I pass them not a pin:
I am not in their debt,
Wherefore they cannot let,
That which I down have set,
Since naught by them I win.
And though their cunning be
Superior over me,
Yet (Sir) for ought I see,
They fail though they be fine:
I would I had the skill
According to my will,
Their curious cup to fill,
I would my self incline.
To speak in your defense,
With you they may dispense,
Esteeming your pretense,
Is for to gratulate:
Those to whom you are bound,
For favor you have found,
Whose friendship to resound
Has helped your estate.
I love not much to tell,
For why, it were not well
To seem to chat or mell
Least that I purchase blame:
But I will beak and bend
And none I hope offend,
If justly they intend,
Their sentence for to frame.
FINIS.
The Castle of Courtesy. Anno.1582.
AS I alone abroad did walk,
bethinking how I might
Come nigh some place that worthy w^r^
for me to view by sight:
I walked long with weary limbs,
my tyered steps did faint,
And Pilgrim wise I traced still,
not feeling of restraint.
I made no force, although I felt
a feeblenes of strength:
But hoped for to have good hap,
to ^ase my mind at length.
So onward still I iorneyed,
through many a Forest thick:
Through many a thornie prickie place,
and many a bushie Quick.
I marueyled much (good reason too)
that all the way I went,
I found no one to parle with,
or utter my intent.
Thus damped all with dumpish doubts
in Forest I alone,
Began to send out soaking sighs,
in token of my moan.
I said, O cursed hapless wight,
what have I now intended?
This venture much disturbes my mind,
my senses be offended.
But since I have so far gone forth,
I forward will go still:
Since only he has set me on,
whose name is called Goodwill.
For where good will familiar is,
there nothing seems hard:
No venture strange can once afflight,
or footing can be bard.
The earnest zeal of deep Desire,
if it have taken root:
It is but vain to let the Spring,
it were but little boot.
Or who will say he will force the Sun
to cool his parching beams?
I mean, who can perform the same
in any Christian Realms?
The whireling winds by Aeolus sent,
can any man allay?
Or Neptunes force in foaming floods,
which does stout ships decay?
No, no, as these things seem but vain,
for any worldly wightes:
So is it vain to stop the mind,
in journey that delights.
I forward went, till at the length
I was so round beset
On every side with pricking thorns,
I knew not out to get.
And then in agony of mind
I shriked out so hie:
As that the Echo did ascend
unto the lofty sky.
And thus in all my deep distress,
as one whom fancy lost:
I laid me down as desolate,
by froward Fortune toste.
The gushing tears came flowing out,
my eyes all dim were made:
And I alone in thraldom thrown,
did tarry in that glade.
For out I knew no way to get,
(of troth I tell you true:)
For every side was closed up,
as seemed to my view.
And as I howling lay alone,
(oh God unto my grief:)
I prayde, help me, a Pilgrim loft,
who craves for relief.
The earnest prayers that I made,
with faithful fixed heart:
Did give me hope that Jove would send
a remedy for my smart.
For in despair he only is
the rock, the aid, and trust:
On whom each creature does repose,
as duty wills, and must.
At length, by chance, I cast mine eye
full watchfully aside:
And by good hap (oh God be praised,
on sudden I espide:
An aged man with griesled beard,
and countenance full mild:
Which when he came, his words were these:
how now, what news my child?
What make thou in this wilderness,
how did thou find the way:
Or to what place would thou have gone,
what mean thou here to stay?
At these his words I rose upright,
and did my duty do:
And craved for his earnest stay,
as will did move thereto.
My child (quoth he) thou seem but young.
and much in mind I muse,
What moved thee to range abroad.
in this thy kind of use.
Assure thy self what I can do
in any thing, I will:
Because it seems thou have a mind,
to learn a farther skill.
With bended knee I gave him thanks,
and did require his name:
Forthwith he told me presently
what was the very same.
My name (quoth he) is called Aid, Aid the conductor to Youth

a helper unto those
That have a willing mind to learn,
rare secrets I disclose.
My years they carry credit true,
no man has me disprooued:
Wherefore at large disclose thy mind,
if thou thereto be moved.
Then I began for to relate
the depth of all my mind:
Wherefore I wandered so abroad,
and what I craved to find.
Good Sir (quoth I) and Father eke, Youth declares the occation of his journey.

because your years are so:
I had desire to go seek
some novelty to know.
Thus have I wandered witlesly.
a journey past my skill:
And who did send me first abroad,
but one they call Good will. Goodwill the procurer of his journey

And I would very feign go on,
to find some worthy place
That might revive my weary b^nes,
and yield my mind solace.
Why then (quoth Aid) I shall thee bring
unto a noble seat:
The place it self so gallant is,
as tongue cannot repeat.
And if thou will bestow thy time,
a Castle I Will thee show:
The which is called Courtesy,
and a courteous Knight does owe.
I answer made with lowely mind,
I am content to go
To any place, where as I may
a farther matter know.
For in your hands (O Father Aid) Youth committes him self wholly unto Aid

I do repose my state:
I hope you will conduct me safe,
from any force or hate.
Yes (trust me) that I shall (quoth he,)
and brought me to that place:
To view the Castle which to show,
does bear a gallante grace.
Upon the Castle gate was set
as we did enter in
This superscription graued in stone,
the which did thus begin.
The sentence engraven in Stone upon the Castle Gate.
NO hoggish hob, nor currish carle
may once presume so bold
To enter here within this Gate,
this Castle to behold.
For why, it serves for courteous wight^,
they shall have passage free:
To enter in, and to abide
if so their pleasure be. The end of the sentence.

And so the sentence made an end,
that was upon the Gate:
And Aid and I got leave to go,
and viewed in each state.
But Lord to tell how gloriously
this Castle is addressed:
It would amase my wits too much,
and crave a greater rest.
The Rooffe by Geometry is hangde,
most bravely carved to see:
Wherein has Art as much declard,
as ever needs to be.
Most gallantly be painted eke,
with Painters cunning hand:
And gilded so, as like the Sun
it shines where you stand.
The Chambers large, and all the Rooms
are wonderful to tell:
I promise you I never saw
a thing I liked so well.
Although my travel it was great,
I hold it well bestowed:
Because by Aid I had such help,
to have this Castle showed.
Alas, if I should enterprise,
each thing to set to view:
I had need to have Homers head,
my wit for to renew.
O Courtesy behold how Jove
provided has a seat:
More glorious then thought can think,
or tongue can well repeat.
O Courtesy, thy Castle brave
is of so great a price:
As scorns Apelles painted piece,
or Cesars rare devise
O Courtesy thou geuest aid,
to every stllie Elfe:
That is of small ability,
for to maintain him self.
Thou frownest not with furious face
nor look with churlish cheer:
But mildly do accord to stand,
the simple sort to hear.
Oh noble Castle, what good hap
had I to see thy ground:
O Father Aid, I yealde more thanks,
then out my tongue can sound.
If I had lurked in my den,
with laysie loytering lust:
I never had seen such a sight,
as chance has now discust.
And yet to speak the verity,
I roame not far from home:
My years be not expyred yet,
that bound me for a mome.
By stelth I did this journey get,
by leave I had no scope:
But hab or nab I proved to play,
and past my bounds did lope.
But whisht, no more of this fond speech,
quoth Wisdom unto me:
Hold still thy tongue, and slay thy self
from such a kind of glee.
Of tatling often does tumulte rise,
and therefore trust not much:
It Is hard to know a faithful friend
of truth the world is such.
The place wherein the Castle stands,
Nonesuch is calde they say:
And by my trothe it may well be,
I think there is none so gay.
Not furious force of Cannons strength,
nor dente of pellets blow:
Ne subtle sleight of Captains head
this Castle can bring low.
Not twenty thousand Soldiers pressed
in strength will ought prevail:
This Castle once for to assault
or once it to assail.
The Captain which this Castle keeps
has Clemency Cleme^cy captain of the Castle.
to name:
His Soldiers they be pitiful,
no stranger the^'le d^fame.
It boots as much for to assay
with force to win this place:
As it does boot, to stay the streams
that be of rageing race.
No, no, the Courteous civil wight
shall easily enter in:
He needs not use great force or might,
that not preuailes a pin.
And as for Grombould groyny groutes
and solemn sullen squires:
No strength, no force, no courage stout^
ne yet their deep desires,
Shall once have entertainment here,
adue, go pack you hence:
Your hoggish nature cannot serve
with mildness to dispense.
You not regard the simple suite
of poor and needy souls:
Oh fis, beware, take heed of that:
for nothing it extoules
As you do think, I Will say no more,
it is not to my matter:
Ne will I praise the use of some
least they esteem I flatter.
The Orcharde that is finely decked
with goodly trees to show: Praise finally preuaile^, except proof be present.

It were but vain to praise too far,
for who the best will know,
Let them go taste and eat the fruit,
and then they shall perceive:
That which is best, and which is worst,
and which to take and leave.
For though unto the view of eye,
a tree be straight and fair,
And growing in most gallant wise
full right up to the air:
Yet may the fruit be sour as Crabbe
and bitter eke of taste:
Wherefore the fruit does tell the truth
how ere the tree be placed.
By outward gesture, hard it is
the inward thought to know:
For sundry men have sundry minds,
and sundry Natures grow.
But where as conversation is,
there knowledge does not want:
And presence often does tell the truth,
when Absence makes it skant.
Who is familiar with a wight,
may soon his nature find:
And trusty truth does credit win
of each well given mind.
The Courteous do the Courteous love,
good Reason so to be:
And I as glad as any one,
that happy hap to see.
For Courtesy and Cruelty
never agreement have:
The one the other seems to skorne
till both be laid in grave.
The Tyrant does not love the kind,
the kind the Tyrant hates:
Because they be not both of mind;
each one the other rates.
For look where meekness is in place,
there cruelty does quail:
And scorneth much the others case,
because he will not rail.
In spiteful wise with cruelty pressed
and venomous tricks to show
To make Debate, and great unrest,
such malice there does grow.
In furious wise, with froward fittes
and terms as hard as steel:
And many other private parts,
that simple souls do feel.
Wherefore to Magistrates I speak,
and such as Rulers be:
Show mercy now, respect the weak
that are in misery.
Stretch out your helping hands with speed,
to succor needy souls:
If poor you aid, God has decreede,
you shall be in h^^ roules.
For if you give unto the poor,
Christ says you shall him please:
And he has daily help in store,
your doubts for to appease.
The greatest praise to any wight
is meekness to embrace:
For so he sittes void of despite,
unto his great solace.
For he that troubles so his mind,
in Raging wise to grudge:
His neighbors count him much vnk^^^^,
and deemes him but a snudge.
Whose paunche is fraught, with puffed spite,
whose head does foster news:
Whose ears do daily still delit^
to hear words of abuse.
Whose heart retains the Enmity
as Cruelty would have:
Who does reject Sincerity
that vices does deprave.
What should I say, or more explain,
to further mine intent:
How should I write, in praise of those
that are to Mildness bent.
The flying Fame: with huffing wings
that is in every coast:
Does sound their praise sufficiently
among the best and most.
And I that have by Aids good help
attained to this rare show (...)
Could not in covert keep the fame^
from some that I do know^
For why, I think it is a thing
that worthy is to rest:
Within some place void of Disdain,
meet for a Courteous breast
Which I will not (so long as life)
neglecte to deck with praise:
For Courtesy I ever loved,
and so have done always.
And will do still, till Sisters three
my fatal days unbind:
And rid me of this worldly yoke,
a quiet life to find.
Though I at first, He was pinch^ with private pangues being desolate, until
^oue sent Aid to assist him.
disquyet was
in mind, for being lost:
Yet see how Jove did send me Aid,
which showed me all the Coast.
As by the heavens vnfayn'd I swear
I would not for any thing:
But that I had this journey tra'st,
this news abacke to bring.
And unto you (O father Aid) Youths tha^k^ unto Aid.

a thousand thanks I render,
I will your Beads man, ever rest,
alas my wealth is slender.
For to requite your travail great,
and pains that you have taken:
Amid'st the wild and savage woods,
and trees that winds have shaken.
But have respect to my good will, Good will is to be wayed though welthe does
want.

my heart is set on fire:
And for to make some recompense
I have a great Desire.
My Youth (quoth Aid Aids reply unto Youth.
) what do thou mean,
these words for to repeat:
I look not for thy recompense,
my pames are not so great,
But that I can with willing mind,
bestow ten times as much.
But soft (quoth Aid) I have not done
my purpose now is such:
As that I will thee farther tract
unto another place,
And show thee there a noble Houlde
which stands with goodly grace,
As I believe thou will be glad,
when as thou do it view,
And think thy pains not to be much,
I know it now for true.
For I perceive thou take repasse,
my matters for to learn:
Wherefore by my intelligence,
thou better shall discern.
For that I am acquainted with
these parts in every state:
And trauail'd have these countries long,
from force of any hate.
O father Aid, Youth.
and shall I thus
much trouble you in deed:
In truth I am at your command
God send us both good speed.
I will even go, where so you please
a better loades man sure:
In all the world I could not have
my purpose to procure.
This place (quoth Aid Aid.
) that I will show,
it is not very far:
A help it is to Courtesy,
and saues it many a ^arre.
It is the Hold, the which is called,
Humility in deed:
Not distant far from castle here,
to help them at their need.
For since thou art to journey bent,
I will the same now show:
And then thou may retire thee back.
thy wonted place to know.
I am right glad it was my hap, Aid.

in wilderness to find
Out such a one, as for to see,
has such a willing mind.
And I (O father) am as glad,
oh gentle Aid and trust: Youth.

The Gods will give thee recompense:
for thy deserts are just.
Wherefore now let us have away,
this Hold for to discrye:
For every hour twenty is,
until it feed my eye.
For I have such an earnest zeal,
as sure I marvel much:
Wherefore (O father let us go,
for my request is such.
Come on my Child let us away,
O Castle now farewell:
Of all the sightes that ever I saw,
thou surely do excel.
FINIS.
The Authors Farewell, to the Castle of Courtesy: 1582.
IF pregnant were my pate, to pen a glorious verse;
If Pallas would permit me Aid, in that I would rehearse;
If Cicero were alive; of Virgil might be found,
I mean their personal presences (^:) which is co^sum'd in ground:
Then would I sure repair, unto them for advice.
And crave assistance, at their hands, to pen some thing of price.
But sith they are consumed, and brought whereto we must:
Therefore unto my simple Muse, I do commit my trust.
Well though that they be gone, yet have they left behind
Their works, to their immortal praise, as fame has the^ assignd.
Yea that is true in deed, but to me that is no Aid:
Because in Latin they are pende, the truth for to be said,
I not it understand, wherefore my skille is less:
I want unto my willing mind in that I would express.
I cannot skale the Mount of pleasante Parnasse Hill:
Wherefore in bone-gree now accept the meaning of my will.
A Farewell I should frame, or else I am diceaued
A Farewell now I will set down, and so farewell, I leave is.
Then thus I will begin, farewell thou place of price:
The only Author, and the cause, of this my small device.
Farewell thou Courteous seat, thou Castle of defense:
Farewell thou Friend, to those that want, esteeming the pretense,
of simple poor plain truth, which means no disdain:
Nor has not (Sir) the worldly wiles, to flatter, fliere, and feign.
Farewell a thousand times, and yet I do^ protest
A simple Soldiar to remain, ready at thy request.
Ready at thy request: nay ready is my intent,
At all times ready for to be at thy commandment.

Castle.

To the Courteous construers of indifferent judgment.
I See a sect, which lean to false report,
And find some cause to cavil in disdain:
I wish they would leave off that friendlesse sort,
And not triumph in vauntes which are but vain.
Their doubtful doomes delighting in disdain,
Might frustrate be from folly, trust me true,
And not with contempt, the simpler sort to view.
To Courteous construers, I do this commend,
Which with good will, do weigh the vvilling mind,
Indifferently their judgment to extend,
And yield report according as they find:
And so shall I at no time be behind
To use my pen, and practice with my pate,
In vvilling sort my fancies to relate.
A homely Houlde for present I prefer:
Requesting those which do the same expect,
With Courtesy their judgment to infer.
For I presume all will not it reject
But favor find, my endeavor to protect,
From truthlesse tongues, which tattle tales but fained
And glory great when others are disdained.
No dolor to disdain. James Yates.

The Houlde of Humility. 1582.
AS fixed mind desire has,
more novelty to see;
And wanton wits are soon inti^^
with such toys as they be:
So (truth to tell) I must not feign,
that were no honest part:
I am as ready as the best
to practice such an art.
Small practice sure I think will serve,
for nature has us taught:
For to forsake that which is good,
and take that which is naught.
In deed more ready for the worst,
then seek the best to choose:
For nature is an enemy,
her Impes for to abuse.
The frailetie of our present Time
is much for me to write:
And silence seldom gets dispraise,
when tatlinge moves despite.
For little said, a small amends
will serve to counter poyse:
When too much mischief does arise
by talkers tatling noise.
But whist, me thinks I here a voice
which does command me stay:
And tells me flatt in few words,
I am out of my way.
O Youth what should become of thee
if Aid were not thy guide:
What way would thou have wandered here.
how soon would thou go wide?
Come follow me quoth father Aid (...)

let us this Houlde go see:
To view each part and how it stands,
in state and eke degree.
So forth we went through forest thick,
and many craching Briars:
Yet did we make no forse of them,
such were our due desires.
And when we had thus past the worst,
at length that place we found:
The which did much delight our minds,
and pleasure did abound.
For lo, we saw this passing Houlde,
so finelis frma'd in seat:
As in my mind I straight did muse
to see a thing so great.
So hugs and monstrous of higth
with Towers on each side:
That gave it sure a goodly grace,
as did report my guide.
The Situation of the same,
upon a pleasant green:
Where Tellus banks so brave did show,
as like may not be seen.
An entry of Trees did grow,
so straight up to the sky:
As made me marvel very much,
to see their length so' hye.
And moated round, where pleasant springer,
do yield a rare delight,
And him that gets a sip thereof
I count a happy wight.
Pernassus Hill where Muses keep,
and joyful noates abound:
May not compare now with this Houlde,
or pleasant fertle ground.
Apollo if he were in place,
to take a view thereof:
Would presently, commend the same,
I know I do not scoff.
The cost which Caesar did bestow,
within the walls of Rome:
Is not coequall unto this,
as I suppose by doom.
When we aproched near this Hold, Resistance.

there did a Porter stand: Porter to the Hold.

Whose name Resistance (sir) was called
a great clubbe in his hand.
For Grimnesse sure he might be Mars,
or Hercules indeed:
Who did command us for to stay,
whereto we both agreed.
He asked us, wherefore we came,
and what was our intent:
We up and told him all our mind,
and whereto we were bent.
Quoth Aid, we are both strangers we
desirouse for to see:
This noble place the which is called
the Hold of Humility.
Then straight Resistance gave us leave,
to pass his watched place:
But in my days I never saw,
so coucht a crabtreed face.
Resistance sure he might well be,
his face did show the same:
His gesture thereto was alike,
as nature well can frame.
Thus onwarde still withouten stop,
or any whit denial:
When we had past Resistance hard,
we further put in trial.
And venterously we did presume
to come unto the gate:
Where as we met an other wight
of meek and comely state.
Who asked us from whence we came
and what was our intent:
We said to see this noble Hold,
our minds were fully bent.
Sir may we be so bold (quoth Youth)
for to demand your name,
He gently disclosed to us
what was the very same.
My name is Salutation,
which never does disdain:
The traueling wighte which worthy is,
All times I entertain.
And as I was a going in Youth.

by chance cast up mine eye:
And looking up upon the gate
this verse I did espy.
The verses upon the gate of the Hold of Humility.
I Am humility, the hold,
the humble to receive:
The stubburne I renounce them quite,
the froward I do leave.
Approach not nigh you currish carles,
lest that my battering shot:
Dischardged be to coile your coats,
and make your stomachs hot.
O Master Salutation
these verses carry fire: Aid.

Their sense is alligant and tarte.
their meaning I inspyre.
And when I came within The Houlde,
how like thou this quoth Aid?
Sir, Youth.
I am even Ravished,
my senses be dismayed.
Dismayed, why? Because I am
in Paradise I think: Aid.

Oh God what Crystal glimmering shows
do make my eyes to wincke.
As Goulde surmounteth Copper base;
or silver passes tin:
So do these sightes (which I do see)
which are the house within.
Whilst Salutation, Aid and I.
were looking round about:
I heard a door which opened
from whence there issued out,
Another wight of comely hue,
at which I stood apalled:
And was Desirous for tokowe
by what name he was called.
And as it seemed he did one hear,
for why? he answer made:
What be these wightes, which ask my name,
or what Sir, is there trade?
Quoth Salutation unto him,
they are both strangers (they)
Resistance gave them leave to pass
hither (as they do say).
I Sir (quoth we) strangers we are,
but may we know your name:
It is Sir Gratulation
of truth the very same.
The Captain I am of this Houlde, Oratulation Captain of the Houlde.

commanding every man:
(That is within my government)
to show you what they can.
But by what means (I pray you tell)
did you find out this way.
I shall declare the cause is such: Youth.

I fixed was to stray,
And like a yongling lost my self,
in forest thick unknown:
And crying out with ruthful voice,
to have my misery known.
By Gods assignement (as I must,
of force confess in deed:)
Came then unto my father Aid,
to help me at my need.
And to be short, I did declare,
unto him all my mind:
How that I was affectioned
some Novelty to find.
Why then quoth Aid, come on thy way,
rise up and go with me:
And I will show you a Castle called,
by name of Courtesy.
And were you at the Castle (Sir) Gratulation.

the better now apaide:
You are as welcome to this place,
as can with tongue be said.
For I am (Sir) solemnly sworn,
this Hold I do maintain:
To help the Castle when they need,
or do command my pain.
But Sirs, since that you come from thence,
you be most welcome sure,
And though you are strangers to me,
yet what I can procure,
You shall command unfeignedly
sirs, with a willing heart.
Then Aid and I both gave him thanks,
and took it in good part.
Forthwith he called a servant out,
whose name was Diligence, Diligence servant to Gran^^lation.

And gave him charge in any wise,
as he would escape offense:
To show us what we did Desire
within the Houlde to see:
And charged him in any wise
from us two not to be.
He well obeyed his Masters hest,
he took great pains in deed:
To show us every place within,
that might our pleasures feed.
Truly Diligence delited much,
to signify and tell:
To burnish out his Masters praise,
it seemed he loved it well.
So up and down from place to place,
by Diligence directed:
He was not slow to show us all,
no labor he detracted.
But thus in brief to cut it off,
and make relation small:
Of any sight that ever I saw,
it passes most of all.
Then Aid and I, when we had seen
enough to please our mind:
We asked Diligence if he could
his Master for as find,
That we might yield him thanks,
for this his friendship showed:
And always resting to requite
the Courtesy bestowed.
Then Diligence did bring us both
to Gratulation kind:
Who asked us if we had found,
the thing to please our mind.
I sir quoth we, we have that found.
and seen we never saw:
And if we may stand you in stead,
we swear by faithful law,
You shall command us at all times,
and so we mind to part:
Protesting yours for to rest,
with faithful fixed heart.
And truly of your gentleness,
we shall not let to tell:
Since you have entertained us,
with faithful mind so well.
And thus adue, high Jove of all
be your chief guide and trust:
For we will homewarde take our way,
as needs of force we must.
Quoth Aid to me, my Youth mark this, An Information given by Aid unto Youth.

in each time, state and season:
For to requite where pains are took,
me thinks it were good Reason:
Should we depart and nothing give
to Diligence (O fie)
Since he has taken all the pains
to seed and please our eye.
I was forgetful of the same, Youth.

of Truth I must confess:
I thank you for remembering it
my duty to express.
So then I called Diligence,
and gave to him Reward:
Who gave us thanks with open mouth,
that easily might be heard.
So we departed from this Houlde,
and did retire then back:
Unto the place from whence we came,
where I was in a wrack,
And Agony of pensive mind,
in place where I was lost:
And houling lay, with yelling voice,
as one whom fortune tossed.
Quoth Aid (my Youth) I found you here, Aid.

and here I will you leave:
And follow you this path before,
and then you shall perceive,
Your homeward way from whence you came
it does Direct aright:
And I will to my Cottage poor,
to rest my Aged spright.
Until such time as fatal Mors,
bereaues my drudging days:
Unto whose pleasure I submit,
not using of delays.
Oh father Aid my only guide, Youth.

my faithful Trust and stay:
And is it thus now come to pass,
that you will needs away?
Who has since first our meeting here,
so faithful to me been:
As ever was the trusty zeal,
of Dido that was Queen. Queen Dido truer then Aeneas.

Whose loyal heart was firmly fixed,
to false Aeneas he:
That stoale away in truethlesse sort,
to force her Misery.
So truth to tell I do believe,
since thus you do depart:
It will occasion be of grief,
and wounding to my heart.
But Aid will not be a frustrate quite,
if urgent cause require:
But Aid will be a mean to help,
the simple that Desire,
Some knowledge of this waywarde world,
which tosseth up and down:
Like furious fretting foaming floods,
when Neptune gins to frown.
Perchance some mutall mind will Muse
and murmr at this case,
And say, what foolish fond Device
has seemed such a place.
To which demand I do reply,
the faithful fixed heart:
Did study for to find out this,
by Aids good skill and art.
Humility, a Houlde in deed,
for those that humble be:
A place prepared for repasse
In modest sort we see.
Where Godly graces grafted are,
with Impes of virtuous race:
The buddes do burnish on the branch
with gallant goodly grace.
Which Joys the heart of every wight,
Whom Natures form has framed:
Whose lowly life, with lenity,
deserves not to be blamed.
The Loyal ^ore that linkes in love,
of force does merrite fame:
The good and well disposed mind
is worthy of the same.
But Amorous toys of Youthful youth
respects not with care:
The truethlesse troth, and friendlesse frau^
that some full closely bare.
No sound nor sober counsel can,
their wilful mind affray:
Esteeming it as speeches vain,
wherein there is no stay. An (...).

Wherefore (O Youths) mark now a Youth.
something to staidness bent:
Which spies that romers raunge in rags:
and lurk in deep lament.
Who finds that likely Fortune is,
a fond incertaine Dame:
Which heaps more hazzardes to the heart.
then thought can think the same.
Who sees the stout and lusty bloudes,
full ^^^etly abide:
When as the hot and furieuse force,
is let out from their side.
I not commend the fickle friend,
that falls out for a straw:
Nor that will rangle for a Rushe,
ne deal so like a dawe.
For he that swears by wounds and blood,
and looks so like a Bull:
When as he comes to do the feate,
his heart is in his skull.
And hotest men of many words
are slow enough in deeds:
And some will fainte that show good face
when but their finger bleedes.
And he that does provoke so much.
the sober man to fight:
If he be entered in his act.
the lustiest blows will smite.
A proverb old, in England here,
the still sow ea^^^ the draffe:
And some do weep which have small cause,
when some aga^^^ do laugh.
I must needs no^ declare a thing.
which comes within my mind:
How some for to out face the world,
will seem the world to blind.
And since of Castle and the Hold,
I did at large display:
Now somewhat of this crafty world
I breefly mind to say.
For I am priueledged in deed,
since Aid has taken leave:
A little to disclose my mind,
for that I do perceive,
The slily falsehood now a days
that restes within the land:
As trust me it was never more,
the truth to understand.
The counter fea^ing crookes to catch,
and simple to allure:
The faithless fond and filthy fraud,
that daily is in ure.
When as that one shall come to you,
and say he is right sad,
And heartily sorry in his mind,
for ill luckes that you had.
And by my troth I tell you true,
I would I could know how:
To help you in this your distress,
I make to God a vow.
Another comes professing eke,
for to remain a friend:
And never to exempt his faith,
until his days do end.
And says, if I eke in stead may stand.
I pray you to be bold:
But when in deed there comes need,
his doings then are cold.
Oh noble flattering flearing world,
oh guilefull glowing heat:
Oh subtle sound, of truethlesse tongues,
that truth does nere repeat.
Not knowing how for to dissemble,
not knowing then to live:
But God for his great mercies sake
such filthy factes forgive.
And root the vipers from their vain,
of stinging at unawares:
By whom the simple silly soul,
is caught in doubtful cares.
And thus the Author makes an end,
desiring each good mind:
To think the best of this his work,
so further shall they find.
The end of the Hold of Humility. 1582.
A farevvell framed to the Hold of Humility.
THe due Desire, that I have to commend,
Humility, I can not well express:
Because that Pallas will not to me lend,
Her cunning quille, therefore I do digress,
From curiouse verse, to feed such fancy fine,
Where to some men their minds do now incline.
But pardon prayed, Presumption pusheth me,
And bashlesse Boldness bids me proceed,
And Hope at hand my thinks does let me see,
That small Disdain, shall come by this my deed:
Wherefore if I should loyter or not write,
Small were Experience, and less were my delight.
But lo behold my thinks I can not tell,
How for to frame, as I before expressed:
Well (as I think) it should be a farewell,
A farewell be it, and so farewell, I rest
From this device, and others take in hand
To gratify, and so it understand.

A dialogue between Age and Youth, Declaring how vain a thing it is to
Presume on Youth, and how we must all yield to Age.
Age. I Am for to be loved, for why?
you must me prove:
You youthful laddes, that youthful are,
it does you much beh^ue.
For I am grisseled Age,
who strikes you with Ache:
And make you yield though with ill will,
your bones I do so shak^.

Youth. It is not grisseled Age
that Youth can now restrain:
Nor make me subject to your yoke,
ne will I yet refrain,
My youthful Toys that now I Youth,
will use in your despyte:
For why? Sir Age you have no force
to banish my delight.

Age. Have I no force, to pull thy pride?
well one day thou shall see,
That I will make thee for to stoop
and yield thy self to me:
And shake as I do now,
when hoary hayres appear,
To make thee leave of youthful toys,
and dalling with thy dear.

Youth. Nay Age it is not thou,
can make me leave to Toye:
For why? therein is my delight,
I houlde it for my joy.
For I have most delight,
to talk with Venus Dames:
For Cupid often does me move,
by force of fiery flames.

Age. Those fiery flames that Cupid sendes,
and do in thee abound:
Thou will at length (I know) them leave,
incertaine is their ground.
For why? who can withstand
when Age does lay his yoke?
Yield therefore now most willingly,
to bear my staying stroke,

Youth. To yield my self to thralle,
nay Age that shall not be:
It is not thou that can me hurt,
I force not much of thee.
For I will thee withstand
inspite Sir of thy nose:
And run my race in youthful wise,
as I do well suppose.

Age. I do not Sir say nay,
but then may run a race:
Yet unto me thou must now bend,
in spite Sir of thy face.
For I can make thee come
to Crouches, if that thou
Be not cut^^^ by swinging wise:
I make to God a vow.

Youth. To Crouches, what are they?
I bid thee do thy worst:
I force thee not, do what thou can,
to me do as thou dorst.
For I am youthful Youth,
I force thee not a mite:
Thy grisseled face, is not in mind,
thou art not in my sight.

Age. I am not in thy sight,
till I do make thee shake:
As I will do it one day sure,
if life do not forsake.
Then shall thou see that I,
have altered thy will,
To bridle fond affection,
wherein thou stand'st so ill.

Youth. To bridle my Affection,
thou shall it find but vain:
Thy purpose shall not came to pass,
thou can it not attain.
For I will houlde thee off,
so long as I have life:
My youth I know thou can not quail,
I find my self so ryfe.

Age. Though youth in thee does so abound,
yet I Age will take place:
And make thee woeful weary, I,
when as I do thee chase.
And though thou seem to run at large,
at length you shall come home:
And be as I am, silly Age,
and counted as a Mome.

Youth. Though thou art counted as a Mome,
yet wisdom does me guide:
That I have ^ights to shift thee off,
and put thy yoke aside.
And though thou would so feign
now catch me in thy trap:
I am so light and quickly gone,
I rest not in thy lap.

Age. Although thou rest not in my lap,
yet I can catch thee in:
And make thee subject unto me,
when as I do begin.
With ach and pain to rouse thy Corpse,
that youth did once profess:
Such is the Strength sir, of my strokes,
when as I do oppress.

Youth. Alas good Age thy strength of stroke,
I feel upon me now:
It lies so heavy on my bones,
it makes me for to bow.
And though I held thee off with talk,
that was but vain:
Yet now I feel that Age can strike
with grievous ach and pain.

Age. O lusty youth, is courage past,
can you no more hold off?
I thought at length you would come home,
for all you did so skoffe,
And yield your self to me,
that now have trapp'd you in,
Although before that you did say,
you forced me not a pin.

Youth. Those vauntes were all in vain,
my words they were but wind:
But thine were trus, as I full well
unto my grief de find.
Wherefore you youthful laddes,
that seem to put Age by:
You may as well presume to clyme,
unto the lofty sky.

Verses which were presented unto the Patron of this book at new years Time.
1578.
I Read (right worthy Sir)
an extant open thing:
Of the rare show of Courtesy,
in Artaxzerxes King:
Who passing through his realm,
great men for very love,
With presents rare, presented him
there good will for to prove.
Whose gifts were of great price,
to show their wealth and port:
The straingest things that could be got,
of every kind and sort.
Which when the King received,
great thanks to them extended:
Their loyal heart, to duty bent,
most Princely he commended.
But (ah) a silly soul
whom poverty nere pined:
Be thought him to present his Prince,
as duty has asu^gned.
Not having wealth at will,
n^ Iuels that were trumne:
Took up his handful of water fair,
came running toward him.
And offered to his Grace,
as Token to Forshow:
Though wealth he wanted, yet of good will,
his duty for to know.
But note the courteouse kind,
of this most prudent Prince:
This present base, not to reject,
nor once it to convince.
But took it gratefully,
for that he did behold,
The true intent, of simple soul,
whom duty made so bold.
So Sir, I earnestly
request this at your hand:
My small present for to esteem^,
next this to understand:
My boldness to excuse,
that saucely thus aspire,
To write so pertely unto you,
before my state be hyer.
And thirdly for to bear,
my rudenes which has raised:
A matter here before your face,
unworthy to be praised.
But forced by good will,
something for to present:
Esteeming not the thing it self,
but simple true intent.
The meaning void of fraud,
composing void of guyle:
For Groslum Caput gives no leaus,
fine verses to compile.
But Trial has me Told,
Experience has me showen:
That Artaxzerxes kind in you,
is easy to be known.
The which did set me on,
to show my true intent:
Some verses (Sir) this new years time,
unto you to present.
For it that I had skill,
according to my mind:
A matter that were worth the fight,
your worship then should find.
But what needs all these words,
as Preface now before:
To signify a long discourse,
to trouble more and more.
But God grant you your health,
his faueur and his aid:
To sheelde you from each feigned friend,
and make your foes dismaide.
God grant accomplishment,
of that you most desire:
In what so ever as it be,
from heart I do require.
God grant that Envy may,
be void of her intent:
Not to prevail at any time,
although that she be bent,
God grant Dissimulation
may shine like Crystal clear:
That unto you each double heart,
may easily appear.
God grant that Deep Deceipte,
at no time do prevail:
God grant as much as he can grant,
God grant no thing do quail.
But all may prosper well,
approaching still to Fame:
Whose worthy works, have merrited
high praises to his name.
Whose happy helping hand
releeuing those that need:
Does win the way to make you live,
for ever more in deed:
Whose daily deeds in use
abroad do so resounde:
As passes my Capacity,
or wisdom to expound.
Perchance your worship will
condemn me in this sort:
And think I write in flattering wise,
to make a long report.
Not so (I do protest)
for why? I you assure:
In that offense I guiltless am,
my conscience it is pure.
And as I scorn the use,
of flattering flearing fraud:
So will I not, while I do live,
neglecte to give you laud.
Destring still of God,
as erst I did before:
Your joy to join with new year now,
and many other more.
Thus (Sir) I humbly end,
desiring God of grace:
Your worship long for to preserve,
in happy state and case.
And when your fatal days,
of force must yield to clay:
Then for to rest, in heavenly place,
that never shall decay.
Finis.
Other verses presented unto him, at new-Yeeres time.
CLeanthes he, whom learnings lore
held in such estimation,
As for to find himself at school,
he used this occupation:
At morning soon, and evening late,
he water tankards brought
Unto those houses of such men,
by whom he vauntage cought.
For being poor, unable was
to keep in place of price:
Until he found, by taking pain,
profit in his device.
Whereby he kept himself at school,
good letters to attain:
And although he was very poor.
yet this way found he gain.
And when he had sufficient,
according to his will:
He then presented to those men,
some works of better skill.
Which showed in him a due Desire
his duty to reserve:
And also eke an earnest zeal,
there favors to conserve.
Even so unto your worship now,
my simple verse I send:
My duty bids me be so boulde,
the same for to commend,
Unto your courteous true aspect,
to construe of the same:
The which is meant for mere good will,
more then for any same.
For I have not Cleanthes skill,
deep matters to impart:
But such as come from simple head,
and eke a faithful heart.
Which caused me this neweyeeres Time
newly the same to write:
They new are of invention,
yet not new of delight.
Impute it not good Sir, for want
of willingness in me:
But want of learning is the cause
no better verse you see.
I cannot gloss with gallant phrase,
my bringing up was plain,
And simple sense inforceth me
to write in simple vain,
Which I present unto your view,
as heretofore is said,
And although not seemly set out,
yet willingness well weighed,
Shall counteruayle the want of skill
that ap^ly here might be:
But of an Ape impossible
it is a tail to see.
The Lord preserve your worship long,
in health, in wealth, and peace,
And grant all things you take in hand,
may have there due increase.
The Lord prevent each fauning foe,
and faithless meaning mind:
Who under show of simpleness,
work mischief in their kind,
God grant unto you glad new year,
with long and joyful life:
And likewise I do wish the same
unto your worthy wife:
Whom you and her the Lord preserve:
so humbly I am bound,
To give you thanks (Sir) while I live,
for friendship I have found.
Resting at your commandment, James Yates.
Verses on friendship.
Under the Cope and glittering hue of heaven,
Are all the joys allotted by decree:
Yet is there none, that may compared be,
Unto a friend that never is uneven:
But does remain all one in constancy.
But for such friends, as are but friends in sight,
They do deceive, incertaine is their trust,
They prove untrue, they moulder like the dust:
But ah, a friend that stands in friendly right.
He is a friend, as needs confess I must.
Now if one find a faithful friend in deed,
Then keep him still, as Ieuell that is rare,
Be sure on this, to have on him a care:
For why? he will remain a friend at need:
As Trial tells, and Truth does well declare.
Verses on false Report.
OH God how false report, does win a man Defame,
And closely ca^peth at his life, to bring him unto blame.
It lovvring lurkes in Den of Dire Disdainefull Dole,
And spies a time to peep abraod, as fire burns the coal.
No wight so wise of will, so s^ber in his deeds;
No one so happy in this world, but false report him feeds.
For each day that he rises from slumbring sleeping bed,
And thinks to spend, the cheerful day deuoyde to Anger led:
Then ere that aro^sie night, approach to take his due,
He hears some false report in hand, which makes his heart to rue.
But he that bends his care to every ^atling tale,
Shall never be without a cause to busy him with bale.
And he shall have conceits to coople with his will,
And some fond fancy put in use, to feed his humor still.
Wherefore a head that is stat'd with steady tamed brain,
Is vvorth a Masly Mount of mucke that worldlings seek to gain.
For riches flies loose, where Rashness rules the band,
And Right and Reason is cut off, where Rigor seems to stand.
But unto false Report, that fables feine and find,
Esteem of them no other vv^^^s, but blastes of bootles vvind.
Put finger in thy care, and hark not to there tale:
For they are motions moved by those that love to hear of bales.
So shall each state standfast, and steady on his gound,
He shall not be accounted wise, that folly does confound.
So shall he sovv in ease, and reap again in joy,
So shall he vvin the wished hap that wresteth down anoy,
Wherefore I count him wise, that bridle can his brain,
And not too rashly ru^ in rage, though cause does him co^straine.
Verses unto his Muse.
MUse not my mind of worldly things,
Thou see what care to some it bringes.
The merri^st mind from folly free,
Sometimes conceaues discourtesse,
Which is the occasion often of Ire,
Through froward will which kindles fire.
But if thou will live well at ease
And worldly wights secke for to please:
Then frame thy nature to this plight,
In each respect to deal upright.
Thou see my Muse, how Fancy feeds,
And what Desire in some it breeds;
Thou see that those, which have been well,
Hauenot the skill thereof to tell:
But t^inke to get a better place
When as they work their own Disgrace
For why? from heaven, they change to hell
In deep despite for time they dwell,
So is our fickle fancy fraught,
Whom can we blame but tickle Thought.
The silly bird that dreedes no ill,
But singes with joyful notes full shrill:
Is by the craft of b^rders art
Ketcht to her pain, and careful smart.
For why? the lime her wings does charge,
Who erst to fore did fly at large,
And then she rests as we see,
To try the birders Courtesy:
Even so, if some do thee entrap,
Thou must needs stay to try thy hay.
Wherefore who well can them content,
Have seldom cause for to repent.
For if thou well do feel thy self,
Change not that life, for worldly pelf.
You know the ease of quiet mind,
Is happiest giste by Jove assigned.
Admit that riches do increase
And then the quiet life surcease:
What is it the better for the gi^t,
When fretting fumes, sweet rest have spilt.
To have both wealth, and quiet vain,
Oh happy wightes that it attain:
Oh golden days of quiet state,
When fortune gives no crabbed mate.
And on the other side I say,
O cursed life that every day,
Does not escape from furious fittes,
Which heates the heart, and wounds the wites.
The merry mean I hold for best,
Oh happy wightes, that it inuest.
The laboring man, with bread and drinks,
Lives merrier in mind I think,
Then some which feed on dayntie fare,
Whose Corpse sufficed, yet have great car^^
For sure that meat digestes not well,
Where merry measure does not dwell.
Oh Life most happy still I say,
That lives at rest and has to pay,
And lies down with quiet mind,
The rest to take that Jove asign'd.
Verses upon the troubles of this World.
OH troublesome world the worker of w^e and base,
Of bitter blastes, of storms that stint no stryfe^
Oh hazardes hard, which heap up such a gale
In furiouse wi^e, that grief is greedy ryfe.
In vain with worldly wealth is any wight endued:
If that by mighty ^oue it ^e not still rene^ed.
The ca^es are great to cause the mind to muse,
Of this and that, that happens often awrye:
The Fates be ^o^d, that does us est abuse,
Wherein consists a great perplexetie.
For whilst with joys we seek to have relife,
In mean time com^s some cause of double grief.
Thus sharply shaped are shimmering shows that shine,
To bleare the eyes that very feign would see:
Such pleasant sightes, whose aspect does incline,
No wight to woe, nor moves to misery,
To carke, to care, to grief, nor to disease.
Oh happy wight whom Fortune so does please.
But for to tell for truth, now which be they,
My wit is small, and cunning it is less.
I cease to speak, my sense serves not to say:
For if per chance, I should not name aright,
They would me deem some mome or doltish wight.
But this to say, the wight that most does spend
His Time in joy, has some time care among.
The world is such the best for to offend,
To reaue their rest that would be free from wrong,
So some do spend the Wicked World in fears,
Which for one joy does bring a M. cares.
Verses in declaration of a friend written at the request of P. W.
MY Muse did move me my pen in hand to take,
In skille^^e wise unsteady to endyte,
But since it is here written, for your sake:
Accept it well and construe it aright.
For of a friend, I do intend to treat,
What is a friend, right well I can repeat.
For to declare by just probation true,
What is a friend, and what a friend should be:
A friend stands firm in causes old or new,
He flitteth not as fickle friends we see,
He keeps his oath, he fost ers eke no guyle,
He laugheth not with face of crafty wile.
A friend is fraught, with faith and fastened stay;
A friend kepes close, that is to him disclosed;
A friend hears not, that may his friend betraye,
But he declares, unto his friend Deposed;
A friend in woe which fails not at need:
A friend so found, I call a friend in deed,
A friend does mourn, and languish in his heart;
A friend lamentes, when as his friend does fall;
A friend does muse, to help his friend in smart.
A friend does mark, and to his mind does call,
How to Disnull the dolours of Disdain,
Which he perceaues do put his friend to pain.
Lo, this my friend, if that thou find by Trial
That firm and fast is kept a vow once made:
Thou can not then, procure a wrong Denial,
But that he is a friend, of friendly trade.
If such you find, keep him and be not strange:
For fickle friends, for every folly change.
I hope this shall suffice to satisfy,
This your request, I write it not for gain,
But glad if that herein I do discry
Such words as do lay open very plain,
The friendly factes, of those whose friendly lore,
Does win them praise: and so of this no more.
Verses upon Hope, declared by Motion and Answer.
Motion. My hope, is help,
which lendes my mind relief:
Though care be cause,
Some times, to force my grief.

Answer. As grief does gripe,
and moves the heart to moans:
So hope is helped,
by privy thoughts alone.

Motion. By thought alone,
is that soon helped indeed?
Ten thousand thoughts,
shall then my fancy feed.

Answer. Well, if thou think
with fastened mind and stay,
Thy thought will help
in thinking what there may:

Motion. With time comes things,
unlike at first to prove:
So hope of Time,
when dolours do thee move.

Answer. Such counsels good,
I take in friendly part,
And yield you thanks,
with willing mind and heart.

Verses written at the Departure of his friend W. ^. When he went to Dwell at
London.
THe absence of a friend,
is grief unto the heart:
The presence of him works joy,
and puts back the smart:
So will (my only Will)
the absence now of thee,
Does make me wail in woeful wise,
to think that it should be.
But when thy friendly Corpse,
shall present be to view:
Then shall I joy, as now I mourn,
that absence makes me rue.
But well, I must content
my doleful mind with this:
We subject are to fortunes lore,
as certain true it is.
Yet this I do persuade,
that absence has no force:
A faithful friend, to make unkind,
that were without remorce.
I do not think that Will,
will so his friend forget:
But will remain in former will,
and be not over set,
By any light conceipte,
which does procure unrest,
To bring disdain, whereas delight
should build within the breast.
No no, I am disposed
to speak this by the way:
But Trust me Will, believe me now,
I doubt not as I say.
For I am firmly fixed,
thy friendship will not fail,
Although that absence might procure
the same for to prevail.
Well, for a vauntlesse vow,
accept this at my hand:
As I have been so will I be,
good Will so understand.
Verses sent unto Master P. W. to Cambridge.
IF gratulations (Sir)
from secret faithful heart,
May at your hands, accepted be
and taken in good part;
Or if a barren verse,
wherein does rest no skill,
May yield unto you such delight
as Motions moved by Will:
Then Sir: as Time outweares
the length of every life,
Which brings some in happy bliss,
and some in dole and strife:
So Time often takes in hand
a matter of erection,
And though at first it seem unlike,
in fine it has perfection.
When this considered is,
me thinks it has a grace:
Which often delights the doleful mind,
and yeeldes it some solace.
And though Sir I presume
to take in hand the pen,
I know full well to whom I writes
and what conceive I then?
I straight persuade my self,
as Trial has me told:
That there does rest in Courteous breast,
receypts ten thousand fold.
Which waied? who would not then,
enforce his doltish brain,
To write his verse, to such a one,
who never will disdain,
The baseness of the same,
though found it do of pain;
Whose Oaten pipes do joy such mates,
as handle Flayle and Saw.
Your friends are all in health,
your foes God grant them foil:
And fig for those that wish you ill,
let grumbling snudge go moyle.
A letter I you sent,
wherein I did discharge:
To write effect of your request,
and fathers speech at large,
Concerning Master B.
who now in Cambridge Town,
By favors letter there received,
God grant he so sit down,
As when he ryseth up:
all wildenesse by exilde,
Which is the ground of graceless green,
where mischief seems to build.
Thus Sir I rest your own,
with true and faithful heart:
Craving of God that you may live,
a life deuoyde of smart.
Other verses written unto him when he was at Ipsvvich: With a Caveat which
was in Printe, sent at the same Time.
IF will do with, not want can hold me back,
Although I find my cunning is but small:
Or if I should Discourse what I do lack,
As I have cause, if well to mind I call:
Then might I cease, and be content to stay,
The skillesse verses which I often displaye.
I feign would frame some cunning in my ^^ile,
And Poet like to notefie my mind:
I have desire such matter to compile
As may content, although in Truth I find
I want Dame learning, which is the chiefest thing
Prai^e to procure, and credit for to bring.
But what mean I to be obedient
Unto oblivion, so vile a thing?
Why do I cease so long for to present,
That to withold, which I of right should bring?
Belike it is, because the changed state,
Has chaung'd my Muse, and put in fear of rate.
Some other matter Differing from the first,
Avoiding sadness works, a sudden fear,
A sudden change, from that which was the worst,
Does suddenly discharge the mind of care,
And on the sudden seems such delight,
As moves mirth more then I can resite.
But Sir, if I should break my inward heart,
In secret sort, as I do it inuest,
I must have Time for that I would imparte.
But I do hope that this among the rest,
Shall simply serve as Toaken which I send,
My Truth and troth to you for to commend.
With vows to vaunte the loyal love I bear,
To you, and all that is Sir of your name:
It were but vain for I Dare justly swear
You do I hop^, so con^^rue of the same.
My duty done to you and all the rest:
I you commend to him which is the best.
Prouyder for all men: who always prosper your proceedings
A caveat convenient for younkers to see:
How fickle Dame Fancy, does chaung her degree,
DRaw near you Impes of youthful race,
respect my words a while:
Beware in Time, turn from that place,
where Fancy most does smile.
Let not the show of smyling looks,
encourage ^^ee to lust:
Least thou be took, with poisoned hooks
where most thou put'st thy Trust.
Do thou not see, it is not race,
to use deceiptfull ways:
For if thou rightly wilt compare,
and mark well the delays,
Then shall thou find such crafty vain,
such soothing void of truth:
As puts each honest heart to pain,
and turns their mirth to ruth.
The modest mind which marks the lore,
and state of this our time:
Does inwardly in heart deplore,
to construe of each crune,
Committed through folly fond,
The mother of Debate:
Which makes no acompt to keep the bond,
of Truth, or trusty state.
Yet mark how foolish wanton Will,
by Fancy brought a sleep,
Will seem to play the noddey still.
in danger more to creep:
When as by proof sufficient,
it plainly does appear,
How Lewdenesle leanes to their intent,
and it some will not hear.
Though in their ears it sounded be,
eke each day in their sight:
They blinded are they can not see,
and why then shall I write?
For sooth because they senseless seem
being lulled so in lust,
And yet they Prudently esteem
the factes of some unjust:
And in their heart do sacrifice,
profoundly and devout,
As though in deed that might suffice,
to bring their fetch about.
Alas, a lack, I mourn, I wail,
I sigh, I sob to see:
That foolish fancy should prevail,
to win the chief degree:
In mortal minds which are but clay.
and flesh the worms to feed,
And like a shadow does decay
most true it is in deed.
Then ere thy breath be spent and past,
revoke thy childish toys:
And give thou over yet at last,
that most was once thy joys.
For why? fond Will thou can not have,
that solely to thy self:
When others may in time it crave
as gained with their pelse.
Thou art of years to knew, this well,
The Hawk whose gorge is full,
Takes more delight to shake her bell,
then on the lure to pull:
Even so conceive this in thy thought.
for why? thou may it see:
The newest things are soonest bought,
and are still wo^^ to be.
Then thus consider in thy mind,
Where thou thy fancy frames:
Give leave let Nature show he kind,
but publish out no names.
For Nature she, can not digress,
I speak not this to feign,
But even the truth for to express,
to those who to that vain,
Do seem so much for to apply,
their study in their heart:
God grant in fine such do not try,
a close vnhidden smart.
And thus adue, I leave this verse,
to scanned be of some:
Which often times do words rehearse,
when as they might be name.
Verses written upon this word, who does refaine to feign, declared unto him
privately by his friend, whom he answers thus.
WHo can refrain where flattery bears sway,
Who does not Sir Dissemble? for sooth y^ upright mind,
Who has ye harmles heart? not verteouse me^ I say,
Who minds most mistrust? the lewd, and truthles kind,
Who favors friendlesse fraud? the fickl flearring friend,
Who most rebukes vice? those that wish godly end,
A loathsome life it were if idleness were maintained,
A brutish kind of trade, to favor a flithie fact,
A mischievous meaning man for most part is disdayned,
An innocent to slay were but a cowardes act,
A pratler much to be, declares but simple sense,
A drunkardes draught, to drink, you grant to be offense,
Well Sir, as for offense, offenders we are all.
As Well the rich as poor, the wise as is the fool:
God grant we may have grace for mercy still to call
And with repentant hearts, to set a godly dole
In place where we may see, and willing to amend,
As we by nature ready are, Gods goodness to offend.
Verses written upon a dream which was dreamed on Sundaie night, the x. of
April, and written unto Mistress F. W.
WHen darkesome night approached was,
and Phoebus ceast to shine:
Then went I to my easing bed.
to rest this corpse of mine.
Wherein laid down (before I slept)
according to my use:
I craved pardon for my faults.
abounding in abuse.
Thus when I had bequeathed my self
unto high love to keep:
My heavy eyes enforced me
straight ways to fall asleep.
Then Morpheus Morpheus God of the Dreames^
he was courteous bent,
to merry make my mind:
And unto me this Sundays night
a pleasant part assignde.
For so, behold, one of my friends,
my thought thus told to me:
That modest mistress F. W. should
most welthie married be,
Unto a proper Gentleman,
whose Parents are of fame:
And he himself by due deserte,
does merrite even the same.
Whose virtuous life from infancy,
has won him such renown,
As Trust me friend, I want the skill,
in order to set down.
Well friend quoth I, a thousand thanks
for this thy happy tale:
This may prevent the peruers pangues
of bitter boiling bale.
With that I waked from slothful sleep,
and to my self did say:
I crave of God with all my heart
that James may see that day.
And as this dream of my delight
did friendlesse fear reject:
So I do wish, if you so please,
that it may take effect.
And thus I end, my duty done,
your self I do commend,
Unto the heavenly Lord of hosts.
who always you defend.
Verses upon fear and Fury.
Fear is a foe, as fury is a friend,
And self co^ceipt is worker of much harm;
Disdainefull doubts, do bring a man to end;
And careful cold does never keep man warm.
Mistrustfull minds have every hour care,
As much as they can well uprightly bear.
The quiet mind is never trobled much,
But tries to take each thing in sober sort:
When frowa^d fancy fretteth, and does grutch
To see her self contemned in her sport.
Well, vain it is here much for to reveal,
In close co^ceipt I will the rest conceal.
Till Time does serve, according to my mind,
And opportunity to open my intent:
I see, yet seem as though that I were blind,
I joy likewise, when as I might lament,
I frame my self to use such play and sport,
As others do, which to the place resort.
Sighing is sign of sadness,
As mirth is shevve of gladness.
Verses upon this Theme. Silence breaks many Friendeshippes. Written unto
his friend G. P.
IF Silence friendship break,
then silent for to be:
Is even the way to loose a friend,
as seems unto me.
For when I called to mind
how long my pen did rest,
From writing to him which deserves,
as well as does the best:
Then said I to my self,
I am too silent I,
That to my friend of all this time
nothing I do discrie.
I do consider thus,
he is of courteous kind:
He will have no ill conceit
I hope within his mind.
for I must needs confess,
I have not idle Time:
So much as I had heretofore,
to write each thing in rune.
I am enforced now,
to bend both wit and will:
For to discharge, that is my charge,
and rest in favor still.
The which God grant I may,
for that is my Desire:
The only sore I seek to salve,
the right I do require.
The more of it I muse,
the more I have good cause,
To try which way, and what to do,
to ponder and to pause,
To print in private breast,
and secrets to conceal:
For why? it is a folly vain,
each act^on to reveal.
But whether do I wend?
I run beyond my reach:
What do I mean to write so much,
as though that I should teach?
O no, I not so mind,
but this is my intent:
Some verses to my very friend,
my thinks I must present.
And thus I you commend
unto the Lord of all,
Who ready is to hear and help,
those that on him do call.
Verses written in a solitary suppose of a doubtful Dumpe.
I Sadly sitting in a Dumpe,
deuysing what to write:
My Muse could not, aforde me that,
which should yield me delight:
Because she saw I was disposed,
in solitary sort,
With matter void of pleasant glee,
to make a plain report,
Of private passions which procure,
the inward woe and pain,
The secret causes of contempt,
the dolor and disdain,
The lingering hope that faintly fe^des
the minds of many wightes,
That pass their time in place,
where grow but few delights.
And yet we see, it happens so,
that in the midst of smart:
They find some causes of conceipte,
which do rejoice their heart.
And trust me true that is the way,
to mittigate the ill:
Which other wise, might be the cause,
of wounding of their will.
To be disposed from delight,
is mean to move or moan;
To constiue of each cross conceipte,
is guyder unto grene:
Wherefore to use indifferently,
the causes of ill luck,
Is mean to move no inward hate,
upon our thought to suck.
We see by due examples showed
the chaunges of our time;
We see there is none so warely lives,
that always voydeth crime;
We see who most does frame him self
to sober sort of life:
Is forced though against his will,
to try and taste of strife.
The most of all that we do find,
as hinderers of good hap:
Are crooked causes which do come,
our state for to intrappe.
The dainty days of due delight,
whereon some trust repose:
Incertaine are, nothing so sure,
as life and them to lose.
The featured face which florisheth,
in beawtie blasing brave:
Shall wrimpled be when hoary Age,
commaundes it unto grave:
The golden hair which glittereth
and shows so by in hew:
Shall lodged be in cloddes of clay,
and kept from worldly view.
The listening ears which do delight,
in tales reporting pleasures:
Shall become deaf, and brought to ground,
when death does find his leisure.
The truthlesse tongue which does agree,
to flatter and to feign:
Shall feed the worms as it has fed,
a number with disdain.
The pleasant nose which takes repast,
to smell each pleasant sent:
Shall lose the profit of the same,
and unto death relent.
The fingers that can finely frame,
to strike the joyful Lute:
Shall cease from pleasure of the same,
when Death does Life confute.
The feet which wonted were to go,
and unto mirth resort:
Must be content to rest at home,
and leave off former sport.
The wanton wight which takes delight,
to cut it with his blade:
By tract of Time grows from that use,
whem Age does him invade.
The Preacher (he) which feeds his flock,
with ghostly counsel pure:
Must yield to death and be content,
his pangues for to endure.
The wise and worthiest wighte of all
that ever lived here:
Must be content to yield to Death,
as plainly does appear.
Thus to conclude, we may be bold
each one of natures frame:
Shall taste of Death, when mighty Jove
assigned has the same.
Verses sent unto his friend, B. M.
IN all thy deeds be circumspect,
Thy secrets not disclose:
But unto such in whom thou do,
a faithful trust repose.
And if thou have a faithful friend,
be loath him to offend:
Accounte thou not of flattering friends
thy ears to such not bend.
Serve God with faithful fixed faith,
and frame thy life so just:
As that thy carnal motions do,
not move thee unto lust.
Conceive and way well thine estate,
take not too much in hand:
Frame thy expenses as thou mais,
live free from others band.
In doing this with just regard,
thou shall avoid much blame,
And every one that marks thy use,
will praise thee for the same.
Verses written for one, who espyinge his friends favor and countenance to be
altered from the former fashion, to satisfy his request, he wrote as follows.
I See and daily spy, by open view too plain,
That those which once estem'd of me, begin me to disdain
And much I muse thereat: but my ill luck is cause,
I stand in doubt and dumpish dreed, and sometime in a pause,
I sigh, I sobbe, I wail, I knock upon my breast,
I toss me here, I toss me there, as one that takes no rest:
I look like silly soul; with ruthful running eye,
And cast my head often times abacke good countenance to espy:
But Lord how coy it seems, and squaimish to the show,
I never thought y^ courteouse kind such malice once would owe.
Oh Fortune fickle Dame, in whom remains no trust,
Whose wavering chances are no stay to ground upon for just, grows
As thou procurest friends, so thou procurest foes;
As thou makes ^^ch, so thou makes poor eue^ as thy pleasure
As now to day to laugh, to morrow for to weep,
And those y^ wake in pleasure sweet, at length in danger sleep
Thus vpside down thou roulest y^ whir^^lig wheel of chance,
And I account them happilesse, that most thou do aduau^ce.
As for my only state I blame thee ^h of right,
For sure none the causer was, but thou of this my spite:
Thou broughst my liking first, and I was well esteemed,
And had a contenaunce void of hate, and ^^lely I was deemed,
To be in pres^nce more, then ever since I was:
But now a chance against me unhappily does pass,
For why? I dare not half so boldly no waspire,
I dare not once presume, to warm me by the fire,
I dare not Parle now, so bold as I was wont,
For if I do the answer comes both sharp, both tarte and blunt:
And head is hanged down, and eyes do look aside,
And faces of the other sort are made as they would chide.
Wherefore you flattering flurt, Dame fortune by your name,
A vengeance take thy truthles trade, for thou did cause the same:
But though in thy dispight, yet will I use my joy,
And never soake my heart with care, although they seem so coy:
For they are but thy fittes, I know it very well,
When pleasantness is so disposed, such things he can expel:
To which most happy time I trust, but not to thee,
For thou art still of flitting kind and evermore wilt be.
Verses declaring how each Desire Is satisfied in Time.
THe hungery soul that wantes
of food his Corpse to fill:
Is forced forth through p^^ing (...)
to remedy his ill:
And if by happy lotte,
he lights in such place,
Whereas is food abundantly
to help his doleful case:
Then you shall see this swame,
whom hungers hate had hist,
When he in Time has had Desire
does skorne that often he mist:
The wight that keeps in Court^
and viewes the gallant shows
Of Princes Palace dearly dect
whose eyes it daily knows:
Esteems not so much
the sight, though it be rare,
As ^e esteems a new fond toy
where on his eyes may star^.
What is the cause of this?
because that he is filled,
And has enough even of the sight
As much as he has willed.
The Goldsmith that does work,
upon the Diamond rare:
Does not so much esteem the sight,
as sequel does declare.
The Painter that does make,
with pencell in his han^,
Some passing piece of Portracture,
like lively shape to stand:
At first time when he went
with will to learn that art,
Desire was a mate of his,
and would not draw a part:
And mark how he (by Time)
of it has had his fill:
He passes more for greedy gold
then he esteems his skill.
Thus is Desire at length
by Time brought into ure:
The Painter pleased is with Coyn^,
as well as Portracture.
The Gentleman that keeps
a Hawk for his delight,
And takes pleasure for to view
the swiftness of her dight,
With spannelles for to raunge,
the game alofte to spring:
At length we see, he wearily
accompteth of the thing,
The greedy Lion eke
that roareth for her pray.
Is never satisfied until
Some faultlesse thing she flay^
And then when she has fed,
and fullness her inuest,
She never passes more for it,
till hunger does request.
The Cat will watch adn wait,
till she the Mouse has got:
And then when she has fed her ^^ll^
a dew, she cares not.
The Scriuener that takes pain
with painful pen to please:
Espieth not his labor wayed,
so much the more disease.
That company which keeps
for a long time together.
By time grows strange, as ever they were
at first time coming hither.
The book that new is mad^
is more esteemed of price:
And better liked on by some
then works of deep device.
Wherefore the way to have
a thing esteemed well:
Is secretly to keep the same
and not abroad to tell.
For why, I well perceive,
examples put before:
That friendship fails, when fancy finds
new liking for her store.
Wherefore to learn to keep
in secret silent breast:
It is a point of wisdom sure,
in whom so ere it rest.
Thus is Desire fed,
thus is Desire strange:
Thus does Desire give us fill,
and makes our friends to change.
Verses written unto one which had wrote A Curious Commendation of his happy
Exchange.
Why do thou vaunt, before thou ^^^owe?
Why do thou brag before thou try?
All is not gold, that is of glittering show,
Nor trust not that which pleases the eye:
For in the same deceipte does rest,
As proof does make it manifest.
For since thou wrot'st that glorious style
In praise of thy so good exchange:
A froward fit some did compile,
Which unto thee did seem full strange,
That at the first it did befall,
Such rough repulse to sleep withal.
Wherefore I counsel thus do give,
To frame thy nature now to abide,
And see that thou discreet do live,
And ^ainte not though some sondly chide:
For why? thou wotst so much before.
You know my mind, ^le say no more,
Verses written for a requisite remembrance of the earth quake which happened
on wednesday the 6. of April. 1580. between 5. and 6 of the clock at night of
the same day.
WHen man does least account of this his end,
And as he thinks does safely sit at rest:
Then suddenly or ever he beware,
Does Death aproch, his corpse for to inuest,
And in a moment all his pomp and pride
And glory vain, is quickly laid a side.
His house the which he takes for his Defense,
And as it were does make a sure ground:
Presuming that it stands firm and fast,
Foundation such no^ likely t^ confound
By any chance, except the ground do fall?
The which high Jove has (...) at his call.
Oh gracious God how wonderful are thy works,
Thy secrets not known to mind of man:
Thou send'st us signs, and tokens of thy wrath,
And if with grace we rightly do them scanne,
We may thus think, and also understand,
Thy judgment day is very ^y at hand.
Yet mercifully thou do us all fore warn,
And would not that we should sink in sin,
But penetently thy merry for to crave,
And leave such leawdnesse as we do begin
Too much to use, alas the more the does,
And God will scourge no doubt, for our untruth.
Oh sudden mosion, and shaking of the earth,
No blustering blastes, the wea^her calm and mild:
Good Lord the sudden rareness of the thing
A sudden fear did bring, to man and child,
They verily thought, as well in field as Town.
The earth should sink, and the houses all fall down.
Well let us print this present in our hearts,
And call to God, for never need we more:
Craving of him mercy for our misdeedes,
Our sinful lives from heart for to deplore.
For let us think this token does portend,
A scourge nere hand, if we do still offend.
Yet never was Gods word more diligently
Preached unto us, then it is at this day:
But out alas, what boot is it to hear,
And presently forget what they do say.
For he which lays his hand upon the plow^,
And turns back, shall speed you know as how.
The wantonness and lewdness now adays,
Is much to write, therefore it is but vain
To seem at large the same for to express:
The grauer sort do much of it complain,
And wish there were amendment of ill life,
Which every where alas is too too rife.
Pride is too pear^e and falsehood florisheth much,
Deceipte is deep, good Lord how it is used:
Envy is rife, blaspheming does not want:
Well, in effect each thing is now abused.
Lord grant we may convert, and that with speed,
For well we know, we never had more need.
Let us not linger and drive from day to day,
We have been warned sufficiently we know:
The Lord is angry, and not without good cause,
And though he do but signs unto us show:
Well let us think if we do thus exceed
In sin so ryfe, we shall it feel in deed.
Amend your lives for the kingdom of God is at hand. Mat. 3. None good but God.

NOt boyst crouse winds of Aeolus force ca^stir the hardy reck^s

Not that my friend is scrupulousse, but friendly be will take,
Nor that he is of Momus sect to mocks that I do make.
Not that I know my friend will now accept my ragged verse,
Nor I think he will reject that which I do rehearse.

Verses written upon the captiouse conjecture of one who not offended.
THe state of worldly wightes is strange,
And mutall minds, do pass my skill:
The good have bad, for their exchange,
By cogitations wrong to will.
The injury has small repay,
Where majesty does bear the sway.
The supreme rule supporteth much,
Me thinks it says, why I am he:
Men know my nature to be such,
As scant my like is known to be,
For where I may I croppe, I loppe:
I make them stoop and bow their top.
But Justice sittes with sword in hand,
And Equity with balance right:
The cause and truth to understand,
To deal by equal Doom upright:
For sure the Gods they will not see.
That worngfull judgment given be.
Then preace in place, thou guyltlesse mind
Whose modest mood deserves no blame:
God will all misbeliues unbind,
And try thy truth with worthy fame:
And like as Laurel kepes the hue:
So truth the falsehood shall subbue.
Conceyne no cause of ponstue thought.
In Nature good, each small is great:
The wise themselves, have wisely taught,
More then my pen can here repeat:
Wherefore I cease, I stay to tell,
Hoping in end all shall be well.
Verses written upon a Question.
I Being once occasioned Comparisons to use:
A friend of mine, a question put, to answer or refuse.
The which was this: What thing was that, which longest does remain
In happy bliss, but at the last it tastes of some pain.
Where with I grew astonished, an answer straight to make:
For why quoth I, deliberation in this I had need take,
Yet as my simple head a simple reason can render,
I hope you will accept it well, though it be small and slender.
Then (Sir) I thus confess, as reason would I should,
To tell my mind I am content, to speak the best I could.
The happiest thing (quoth I) is Gods eternal grace.
For that is that which does remain and stays in happy case.
For else I know no thing, that happy can be counted,
No worldly wealth, no Tower high, that to the sky is mounted,
No faith of any friend, for why it shall decay:
We see it is like fortunes wheel, which turns every way.
In faith my friend (quoth he) you have me full resolved,
It seems you trust not much the world, from it you are dissolved.
The fragrant flourishing feats, and gallant glosing glee,
Is like a blast or puff of wind which blows the leaf from tree.
Esteem it as it is, and weigh and ponder thus,
That minds of men change every hour as fancy does discuss:
But ah, the changlesse state that ever shall endure,
Is Gods eternal bliss on hye, of this we may be sure.
Verses written upon Desire, to unload the mind.
THe Bird that buildes her nest, does order due observe,
And therein takes her rest, her younglings to preserve:
As nature does ordain each thing by course of kind,
So she does them maintane till seekers do them find.
Like so where worldly woes do daily still increase,
And lucklesse chances show that sorrows will not cease
Till happy hap does hit, and course does turn^ and change,
And good luck come to those, to whom she has bin strange.
Where want does weaue the web, there sk^nt does pleasure grow,
Where good (...) does (...), there ill success does slow,
Where Patience perforce in spite must used be:
Unhappy is that course, such hapless hap to sec.
As pleasantness does vade, Small difference between pleasantnes and
ioyfulnesse.
and dies like the flower:
So ioyfulnesse consumes within one silly hour.
Or what does boot it now in mirth for to abound,
When as we bend and bow to sorrows sollemne sound.
The head oppressed with dumpes, the heart does heavy make,
And wayward chances come, our joys away to take.
And as the Impe that's green, is tender for the knife:
So mirth is seldom seen, whereas such cares be rife.
Verses which signify the ease,
How meddling least, does not displease.
THe busy heads, whose harebraine wits,
With causeless cause will have to deal:
Do often show but foolish fittes,
For nothing they can close conceal.
All you that mean to live at ease,
To meddle least does not displease.
The Royster and the quarreling fool,
That stands upon his guard of strength:
May meet with one that shall him cool,
And overcome his pride at length.
All you that mean to live at ease,
To meddle least, does not displease.
The pratler (he) cannot abstain,
No yet keep in his tongue from prate:
O blame him not for it is his vain,
He takes a glory in that rate.
All you that mean to live at case,
To meddle least does not displease.
It Is vain to put our hand in fire,
Or in a fray to take a part,
When as no cause does so require,
Perchance he comes unto his smart,
All you that mean to live at ease,
To meddle least does not displease.
The proverb often thus does show,
Which warns us in this respect:
Here much but little seek to know,
That any tumult may erect.
All you that mean to live at ease,
To meddle least does not displease.
By busy pates strife and Debate,
Rancour and Rage be reared upright:
Envy, Disdain and cruel hate,
Are put in ure by such a wight.
All you that mean to live at ease,
To meddle least does not displease,
So may you well be bold of this,
The love of each man thou shall win:
And have likewise eternal bliss,
For quiet state you lived in.
All you that mean to live at ease,
To meddle least does not displease.
Of meddling least I thus define:
The happy state in it does rest,
And like a Iuell it does shine,
Among all Iuels of the best.
All you that then will line at ease,
To meddle least does not displease.
Verses written upon Saint James his day.
OH Blessed Saint, whose glorious name does shi^^
Throughout the world with fame and honor ek^:
Whose wisdom rare, and modest life divine,
Do show thy felse to be both just and me^ke.
Thou follow'dst Christ, thou never wast to seek:
God grant I James may ever do the like,
That James may joy with James that was so pure,
In heavenly throne, which ever shall endure.
O Lord Direct and guide my steps like his,
With harmless heart to tread so true a trace:
Then shall my steps be steadie and not miss,
But by good life to win thy heavenly place.
With courage bold to come and view thy face,
For that I have sincerely run the race,
And lived upright in thought, in word and deed,
And in excess of sin do not exceed.
O Lord if I may justly this approve,
Then let me have according to desert:
Reject me not but for thy tender love,
Reuerse the rage of sins infernal smart.
And I protest to laud thee with my heart,
O Lord I crave from sin do me convert:
That when my life no longer here may be.
My soul may rest in heaven above with thee.

To the virtuous and his appro^ed good Mistress, Mistress Elizabeth
Reynowls, wife unto his appro^ed good Master and friend M^ster Henry Reynowls
Esquire.
COnsidering with my self (worshipful Mistress) the due desert preceding to
your person, the perfect proof of pure pre^ence, in supporting and holding up
of virtuous exercises: was and is the occasion to incourag me of presenting
this unto your view. I am though unskillful yet not unmindful of your deserts,
which if I should take in hand to pen, I were like him which (...) and (...)
adventured to ^reade the Maze, And being in, could not find the way o^t
again, but by long time and instruction. So if I should begin to write, I
must have both long time, and also instruction in learne^ lore. This my present
unto you (being simply penned Entitled The Chariot of Chastity) has been by
forgetfulness kept from my sight, and long has lingered in the lodge of
Lasinesse. But when requisite remembrance had deemed of Delay: Then presently
perswation (...) me to publish the same. But I stood in doubt whether I might
present it unto you: waying the insufficiency of the device, but being
imbouldened by (...) meaning, I was encouraged, and as I have presented unto
your worships husband, my simple Castle, making him patron of the same: So I
thought it good to unite you together. Selecting you for Patrenesse of this my
present, wishing unto your Mistrishippe as duty binds me^ flourishing
fel^citie in this life, and in the world to come Heavenly happiness.

Your servant to command, James Yates.
Verses on the name of Mistress Elizabeth Reynovvls.
E Experience of your Courtesy imboldeneth me to write,
L Long might you live in loyal love, unto your faithful make,
I I crave of Jove for to uphold your days still in delight,
S Sending his blessing on each thing, y^ which in hand you take
A Advancing virtue, infamouse vice you ever did forsake:
B Bearing a zeal to sober minds, well given, void of ill,
E Extolling good and godly works to them you have respect:
T The modest Matrons you frequent which scorn at wanton Will,
H Hauty hearts and pompiouse pride you always did reject.
R Regarding much the virtuous chase of Diana and her Dames,
E Expelling wild and wanton works, which vau^t of Venus hue:
Y Yielding no whit unto the blaze of Cupids flashing flames,
N Noting such matters as you find by trial to be true,
O Omitting not to do each thing in time and season due,
W Wisely waying what does want, and it for to renew,
L Lending relief, in time of need, to those that want the same:
S Sure due desert does well deserve to have immortal fame.
No favor to fortune.
To the Courteous and Friendly Reader.
GEntle Reader, I shall thee pray with courtesy to view this simple work, and
not to deride or skorne it because the baseness of it deserves the same: for
the^ thou do utterly abash me, and make so to blush, as boldness to attempt
the like, shall not so easily be found. Thou may account me more willing then
witty, but judge uprightly and weigh my well willing mind with courtesy, and
say this I pray thee (in my behalf) that my meaning was to please and not
offend, as he that knows thy thought (and mine) does know it full well, and
therefore since I mean well, I pray thee with willing mind receive it well, so
shall I be desirous to endeavor my self still daily more and more to the
acco^plishment of my well willing mind and earnest determination, such as
hearty affection would set more unto the view, but that skillesnesse does hold
me back, and shuts up the gates of knowledge against me, and will not
suffer me to have aboade within that excellent place, to the which is due such
praise as my tongue has not utterance to comme^d. But gentle Reader (to be
short and knit up the matter) I pray thee accept it (as it is) and bear an
indifferent mind to judge with modesty and not rashly to condemn me: let me
not have chafe in stead of corn; that is skornes and mockes for good wills
sake: but with a will receive it well, and if thou well receive it, my will
shall not want to do thee pleasure, at all times.

Farewell. James Yatis.
The Authors Verdict of his Book.
THou little Book, that thus presumes
to raunge in open view:
Thou shall but get to me dispraise,
and busy heads renew,
To set these wily wits aworke
some foolish faults to find:
We see it is the worldly course,
some thereto give their mind.
I might have kept thee still at home,
but friends did me require,
To give thee leave to go abroad,
I granted their desire.
And what by that now shall I get,
a mock of some I know:
It is the state of worldly wightes
their floutes for to bestow.
And as the Merchants mart for Coin:
So Momus mockes for spite,
Whose Iolting toys would be disnuld
of every honest wight.
Of truth my Book I do beleeu^
thou shall not so go free,
But that there will some doubtful speech
be spread abroad of thee.
God send thee luck and me no ill,
and so adewe, farewell:
But I presume that unto me
thou something have to tell.
The Book to the Author.
WHat verdict do you give of me^
what words be these you use?
What follies fond do foster forth
these ill compacted news:
Why, stay your self for to surmise,
the worst of me I pray?
For none so ready fault to find,
as Bayard blind some say:
Whose faults shall scanned be as thus
with wise men well I wo^:
They will say, thou fool thou find'st a fault
yet seeks to amend it not.
But this I say in your behalf:
your youth and simple skill,
Cannot accomplish that you would,
although you have good will.
But truly (Author) do not think
that I shall get thee blame:
For in good sooth to tell my mind,
thou not deserust the same.
I know thy mind was bent to please
and none for to offend,
I know thou had a care to bring
me thus unto an end.
I know thy friends requsted thee
that I abroad might go:
I know full well as true it is
that truth is very so.
I know it is not Braueries brag,
to boast or vaunt of praise:
Or Lucres craft, for profittes gain,
that thus me first did raise.
I know that he requested it,
who is thy very friend:
Which has requited all this pains,
and will do to the end.
Wherefore if worldlinges vainly judge
as commonly they use:
You must contented seem to rest
since so they will abuse.
And marvel not if I be blamed,
when works of greater skill,
Have had such hateful speeches given,
as trust me it is to ill.
But I shall so my self behave,
and manner so my mood:
As none shall judge amiss of me,
except be Robin Hood.
And if that none do judge but he,
I do not greatly care:
I shall him answer well enough
as time does me prepare.
In mean Time humbly I end,
my self I do commend,
Unto all those that wish me well,
being loath them to offend.
FINIS. Trial tells the Truth.
The Chariot of Chastity. A Careful Commendation thereof, written at the
request of a very Friend.
OF all the happy gifts of God,
bestowed on mortal wightes,
Dame Chastnesse is a gift most rare,
wherein God most delights.
For Chastity does purchase fame,
And heavenly place above:
Where Angels sing in joyful wise,
as scripture plain does prove.
All such as to their mates be true,
with faithful heart entire:
Have place ordained in heavenly throne,
for to avoid hell fir^.
But if that truthlesse troth be tried,
unseemly and unmeet:
That is no Matrons life I trow,
n^ wisdoms lore discreet.
Although blind Cupid move thy mind,
some pee^ish parts to play:
Dame Chastnesse if she be at hand,
will straight such use alay.
Though Beawtie has endued thee,
if Chastnesse stand aside:
That is but Beawtie to the world,
Which can not long abide.
Yet Beawtie is a blazing bait, Beawtie is brittle.

to please each Amorouse eye:
Whom Cupids knights do often frequent,
experience does it try.
The which all Amored folk delight^,
and causes much debate,
And forces furiouse fretting fumes,
and deep disdamefull hate.
O God when some behold and see
the pleasures that abound,
In such fond t^yes^ and culling tricks,
they say they are unsound:
They are not for a Matrons mood,
Lucretia did not use,
But firmly did her faith observe,
till life did her refuse.
What though that vile Tarquinius he, What will not (...) De^^^e attempt.

by force did her assay:
She never ioyed afterward,
but sought her own decay.
Quoth she, shall I remain defiled,
unto my loyal love?
No sure, some way to end my days
I do intend to prove.
I feel such painful passions,
which do bereave my rest:
As with this blade now in my hand,
I mean to pearce my breast.
Wherefore this blade assuredly,
shall end my loathsome life:
So shall I then be free from fear,
and void of this my strife.
Lo thus the Matron slew her self,
because she would not have:
A body for her spouse unchaste,
but brought it to the grave.
Oh Virgins let this be a gl^sse,
to show you honest life:
Remember how that Chastity,
did rest in her most rife.
It is the greatest praise (perdy,)
that any wight can get:
It adorneth sure your life so brave,
as pearl on you were set.
You shine in world like Crystal clear,
your praise is rife in mind:
You duly do deserve such fame,
as is for you assigned.
You show no wanton countenance,
you tattle not at large:
You hold no part of Cupids farm:
you do deny his charge.
You lean to Chastnesse steadfastly,
as Rock and bulwark strong:
You spend the day in virtuous use,
as does to her belong.
For idle sportes decline from praise
they hold no part thereof:
But cogingly do spend the Time,
with many a girding scoff.
And if they chance to catch one in,
who will come of in gifts:
They Care not so they may it have,
though he be put to shifts.
Their conscience is large (God knows)
and hands are open still:
For to receive, what given is,
such is their greedy will.
Yet for all that they may be Chaste,
I do none here reprove:
He knows all their secret thoughts.
that sittes in heaven above.
There is none can hide their guile from him,
he knows all so well,
As sure it passes me to think,
or ^ke my tongue to tell.
I know for true as scripture says,
a chaste and virtuous life,
Shall flourish like the Olive tree,
whose leaves are ever rife.
She shall accepted be of those,
that Tread her honest trace:
And not disdayned but much in price,
a certain sure case.
But wanton wildness snuffes in nose,
to see her given so:
And often wishes in her mind,
her steps to overthrow.
And Cupids knights, do skorme this Dame,
because she not repaires,
Unto his Court, to be as one
of not sufficed heirs.
And Venus frowns to see her so,
high minded to abarre:
And wishes her to be untrue,
that breach might make a jar.
Such is the counsel of that court,
light wantonness of kind,
Inducing her to love one or two
that pleases most her mind.
Yea three or four are not enowe,
for some whose mind does raunge,
They have no blood within their Corpse,
to make them blush for change.
But constant Chastnesse simple stands,
and shrowdes her head for shame:
She maruels much to see their minds,
so fixed on that game.
Oh what a thing it is to think,
of twenty euilles pressed:
That come of too much lavishness,
disturbance, and unrest.
Pity this case good Matrons grave,
lend Aid it to disnull:
Help, help, for trust me it is Time
such vices down to pull.
And if you know within your Town
one person of that set,
Dame Chastnesse says you should not leave
until you out her ge^.
Oh virtuous Dame how is thy mind,
given up to Constancy:
Alas how should I pen thy praise,
I know not well perdie.
But sooth to say, the flying Fame,
that is as swifte as wind,
Has bruted abroad sufficiently
of Chastnesse and her kind.
One night Sir Morpheus did me lead,
and then unto me showed:
How Lucrese sat in heaven above
her seat was there bestowed.
And although she her life did end
in such a desperate wise:
Yet thou may see she has a room.
above here in the skies.
There saw I eke Zenobia
that Gracious Queen so Chaste:
Sitting aloft in heavenly Throne
which never aye shall waste.
And Etifriga sometime our Queen
in England here did reign,
I did behold her where she sat,
ask Morpheus if I feine.
A multitude of Matrons sure
was there as I did see:
Yet Morpheus told not me the names
but only of these three.
For why (quoth he) I do not mind
to tell thee any more:
If thou can learn their names thy self,
then keep them for thy store:
And write of them as thou think good,
(but what should need so much)
So busily to take in hand,
It would but get thee gruch.
I answered him with words most mild,
and seemly countenance sure:
I thank you that you would vouchsafe
these three to put in ure.
And when these words I spoken had,
sir Morphe^s did depart,
And I awaked from my sleep, Morpheus departs

and maruail'd in my heart,
What wight he was, and how I came
unto those joyful sightes,
To view the place and to behold
th^se glorious heavenly wights:
And now to tell the full thereof
that I in ^^eepe did see,
I will assay with simple skill
which re^reth now in me.
My thought I was thither by him led,
since he is God of Dreams:
Conuayed by him as I thought
unto the lofty heavens.
Where I beheld most glorious Dames
which shined like the Sun:
For by their Chaste and Virtuous life
that heavenly place they wunne.
There might I view the Angels face,
there might I hear such songs:
As did rejoice me very much,
as right thereto belonges.
There is no weeping any Time,
but only mirth and joy:
Who would not then li^e Chaste to gain,
a place void of annoy.
They shall behold our glorious God
sitting in heavenly seat:
There shall be such joys as do pass
my tongue for to repeat.
There shall they live a life for Aye
which never shall surcease:
Alas we live here mortally,
our life does soon decrease.
We need not boast, we are like grass
which withers with the sun:
Alas how tickle is our life,
how soon has death it woone.
Our life is ^raile, our days no stay,
for us to lean unto:
Incertaine is each thought we think,
or what we else can do.
Well, if thou be esspoused once,
and linck'd with wedlockes chain:
Convert thou not to others use,
least hateful be thy gain.
For look what order thou do use,
the same thou shall embrace:
When as thou comes^ before that Judge,
that Judges each man's case.
Beware no wantonness be seen,
O maiden some so pray:
Live as thou would intend to live
in (...) for (...).
Love only one (...) thought
as heart and only d^^re:
So shall thy life be Chaste in deed,
this sentence is most clear:
Yea clear, (...) clear, as clear may be
which (...) the (...)
Bruted abroad by ^^ying Fame
which never shall be done.
Beauty is but a blazing bayte,
in high respect of this:
Yet Beauty pleases minds of men,
as certain true it is.
Beauty is glorious in Attire,
according to her hue,
Alluring the eyes of men
upon her for to view.
Mark this I say you Cupids knights,
esteeming Beauty so, Those which more account of beauty the^ have respect to
Chastiti^, are often rewarded contrary to their expectation.

That it may happen for to hit
to bring you unto woe.
Was not strong Sampson (he) beguilde
when harlot clipped his hair?
Was not the valiant Hercules
also ketched in snare?
Did not Poor Paris buy it dear
for Hellina so fine:
When all the Troyans felt the smart
as Terror did assign?
Did there not rise Achilles wrath
upon him silly man,
Which did conclude, in blooddy broyl^
a woeful cause to s^an?
Did not the vicious Sodomites
and Gomorians feel the smarte:
Because they had not grace to turn,
and from sin to convert?
No preaching could them reform
til fiery ^lames from hye:
Did down descend, them to destroy,
O ruthful miserye.
What was the cause? their fleshly lives,
their vile and vicious deeds:
They follow not Dame Chastnesse steps,
whom Riot only feeds.
But if they had addicted been
to chastnesse and good life,
They had not felt the furtouse force
of their deserved strife.
But they were given ryotously,
to pleasure and to pride:
It is impossible well to live,
where grace does want to guide.
Oh Chastnesse thou the flower of grace,
the Impe of joy so dear,
The Lantern light of life so pure,
which shines like Crystal clear.
The proppe, the pillar, and the stay,
which holds up honest life:
The hope of heaven, the hap of joy,
which ever shall be rife.
Oh God what Beneficialnesse,
by Chastnesse does ensue:
Much more then I with tongue can tell,
or pen can well renew.
Or if I had Dame Pallas Aid,
or Poets learned style:
Yet trust me true I were too weak,
her praise for to compile.
Wherefore of Poets thus I crave.
such pardon to attain:
Since that but skillesnesse does lead
in verse to show my vain.
For surely I not presume
in gloriouse title brave:
But from my heart deuoyde of guile,
pardon of them I crave.
For to proceed as simple wit,
shall lend me simple skill:
Where nothing wantes but learning she,
to aid my ready will.
The horse although his force be small,
yet if he have desire, A base comparison.

Is worthy simply of great praise,
though he ly in the mire.
Even so I must confess to you,
I have an earnest will:
To praise this worthy gift in deed
though simple be my skill,
Wishing I had been learned in school,
among the learned sort:
Then should I with less tediousness,
have made this my report.
But truly I lament the loss,
of that I most desire,
Which to recover by no means,
I can not well require.
But Lord it is a world to see,
how foolish fickle youth:
Accounts the school a purgatory,
a place of pain and ruth.
And never are in quiet mind,
till absent thence they be:
Youth only minds play and sport,
apparently we see.
But when that Time has brought our years
and some experience gained:
Then they lament the loss of Time,
which once they so d^^dayned.
A lamentation made to late,
(...) ^^^hsome to inuest:
For to (...) the loss of Time,
is p^nsiue to the breast.
What mean I thus to spend my Time,
so fon^^y to ^^^yte:
I see it is want of learned lore,
to guide me now aright.
Me thinks I hear one say to me, A supposition.

go too, go on, proceed:
Of former matter to entreat.
for this is more then need.
Praise thou Dame Chastnesse, as thou should,
Digress not so aside:
And to thy matter directly go,
and in it do abide. Answer

Wherewith I blushed and said again,
oh Sir I pardon crave:
Accuse me not for slipping so,
my matter to deprave.
But give me leave to raunge a while,
by foolish fancy fraught:
So shall you pleasure me no small,
since that my wits be naught.
But since I did digress so much,
I ten times praise this Dame:
Whose Chastity and virtuous life,
deserves eternal Fame.
Her steps are steady like the rock,
her fortress is so strong:
As no assault of Cupids Crew,
shall enter in by wrong.
And as the pleasant meades refresh.
the flying fowls in air:
So does Dame Chastnesse comfort give,
to those that might despair.
Which suffer many Derisious floutes and mokes,
of ^il^e and vicious kind:
Yet sure the chaste and constent life,
all forrowes do unbind.
A rich reward, by Due desert,
to see such culling mates:
Be tinged about the town in Cart,
and pulled by the pates:
When Chastnesse rests like a Queen,
In high Magnificence,
With reverence done of honest sort,
and scapeth such offense.
As makes them often times ashamd,
and shrink their headee in hold:
And change in colors black and blew,
as though they were acol^:
But Truth to say, they are a cold,
in this chaste honest lore:
They are more hot in Venus flames,
then honesty in store.
Revoke, recant, relent with speeds,
least Time do come to late,
I speak not to the honest Dames,
but to the viciouse mate.
For why, I need no honest warn.
then should I be too bold:
And I were worthy to be blamed,
so much for to unfold.
Oh worthy wightes you sport your minds,
with sad and sober sightes:
Oh gloriouse Chastnesse how she shines,
oh blessed and happy wightes.
O sacret Dame, by Jove ordayn'd,
to be in heavenly place:
Where as no spot, of spotted life,
thy seat shall once deface.
But with a heavenly body thou,
shall there remain for Aye:
Where Angels sit in seemly sight,
which never shall decay.
Why then who would not live a life,
as Chaste, as Chaste might be;
For they shall have as promise is,
eternal bliss you see:
Where contrariwise we purchase death,
and flashing flames of fire:
In Plutoes pit to spend our Time
if grace we not require.
There shall we see the broyling brands,
and fendes of ugly hue:
There shall we hear lamenting cries,
with Torments that renew.
Upon such mates, whom Carnal Lust
in life of fleshly will:
They had not grace for to repent
but did persevere still.
To great confusion of their soul
in everlasting fire:
Wherefore God grant we may be Chaste
for to avoyde his Ire,
And that we treads Dame Chastnesse steps,
and on her so repose:
As we in end may purchase heaven
when vital life we lose.
And there to rest in heavenly bliss
and see our glorious God:
Which has authority us to scourge
for our offenses od.
When plagues y^ Cupid knights with pain,
and Bacchus drunken mates:
And such as give their mind to lust
in end with scourge he rates.
But Chastity he does allow
as virtue excellent:
Who so does frequent the same
shall never sure repent.
O Chastity how is thy seat
ordained in heavenly throne,
Assigned there by mighty Jove,
whereas there is no moan,
For as Saint Matthew does discuss,
a Chaste and honest maid,
Should be content to welcome death
and be no whit afraid.
For why, says he it is glory great,
to dye a virgin pure:
So shall they gain a precious place
which ever shall endure.
Her name shall graven be in gold,
or else in Marble stone:
Which shall be extant to the world^
although that she be gone.
Behold you Dames whose chastity
does merrite well the same:
And trust me, by your due Deserte,
does win you endless fame:
You get renown immortal sure,
for Time withouten mind:
You do as much as may be done,
or in that way assigned.
Wherefore keep fast that key so rare
the which no Smith can make:
But only he which on the cross
did buy it for your sake.
Whose guiltless blood you know was shed,
though he did not offend:
The cruel Jews him to torment
their malice did extend.
O only sweet and Savior great
of all the world so w^^e:
How did thou suffer pain for us,
with spear thrust in thy side.
And all was for our sinful lives
the which we follow still:
But Lord grant that we may convert
and if it be thy will.
And with a true and faithful heart
as Marie Magdalen she:
Did her repent of sinful life,
even so Lord grant may we:
And bring sweet ointments to thy seat,
and look thee in the face:
And hope to rest with thee in bliss
which never shall imbace,
But shall remain tune out of mind,
as truth does well relate:
In place where as is naught but joy,
and at no time Debate.
What say you to this, Dames so chaste,
what say you to this news?
Live chaste, hue chaste, and then be sure,
you live without abuse.
For chastnesse is much honored
in every place with Fame:
And Castnesse of each man has praise
as worthy of the same.
But where as Beauty ryotously
with fleshly will indewed:
Does not regard her chastity,
mark then what is i^sued.
For Cupids knights spying that vent,
do thither straight repair:
And think it is a match obtained
by foolish speaking fair.
And when that once they find the haunte
with entertainment good:
Then stay they still to spend their Time,
in fleshly giddie mood.
And use such prancks as please them best:
too much for shame to write,
Or more then wisdom would permit
should come unto the light.
It were but vain to meddle much
or gloss in glorious sort:
It were but vain to praise and prate
or make a brave report.
It were but vain so seem to deal
in place of great unrest:
It were but vain to pinch the mind,
and busy much the breast.
It were but vain to go beyond
our own knowledge and skill:
It were but vain to meddle where
we shall but get us ill.
Wherefore (my friend) since I have now
performed as you see:
That your request which long ago
you did make unto me,
In writing of Dame Chastity
according as you willed:
Accept of it in friendly wise,
your request is fulfilled.
Desiring you of this device
to judge with equal mind,
At all tunes for to pleasure you,
you ready me shall find.
Although in deed I simple am
for to perform the same:
Yet willingness of my true heart
shall clear me from the blame.
That finding wits devising still
to move debate and str^fe:
I Will say no more, but God amend
their lewd and wicked life.
The end of the Chariot of Chastity.
A Dialogue between Diana and venus: Declaring what can be alleged of either
side for confutation.
Venus THe gallant Youths with bold attempt,
my Darlings will defend:
They Will preace in place with glittering blade,
their blows abroad to lend.

Diana The modest Matrons then for me,
my honor will uphold:
By siuile sort, and honest life,
which shines as bright as gold.

Venus Thy life, nay, nay, it is not like mine,
I swarm in pleasure so:
As that no day does pass my hands,
but new delights I know.

Diana Well, well, I force not for delights,
of those thy Courtly tranie:
I do defy such pleasures as,
in end do prove but vain.

Venus Oh, I am Lady of the world,
each one to me consentes:
They lust, they love, to like my law,
I know it is their intentes.

Diana Thy law is Transitory sure,
but mine remains for Aye:
No discord does arise by me,
(...) I do stay.

Venus Do thou condemn me now of ill,
by flat and open speech:
Declare and show thy mind at full,
I heartily beseech.

Diana Within your court I daily view,
much riot there abroch:
With odiouse oaths to please your Impes,
and dallings that approach.

Venus And your Impes, are circumspect,
they will not look awrye:
Because you are a Goddess Chaste,
no illness you will espy.

Diana No illness, yes I see too much,
I would it were not used:
I pray to Jove for to reform,
the factes that are abused.

Venus Abused, why, in what respect?
you'ill count my lust a vice:
Perchance you will condemn my baits,
that punkers do entice.

Diana Condemn yea, and eke defye,
I loath to see thy trade:
I spite thy state, I scorn thy use,
that ever it was made.

Venus To scorn my use, it is but vain,
a fig for such a flurt:
Now guppe you honest Goddess you,
you never do no hurt.

Diana Well, well, no doubt the mighty God,
that does us goddesses guide:
Will pay with pain: I Will say no more,
no longer I Will abide.

Venus To prove perswations now with me
you shall but lose your time:
Farewell, adieu, be honest still,
to Riotte I will clime.

A thankesgeuing unto God for the happy, peaceable, and most gloriouse Reign
of our singular Sovereign and Lady, Queen Elizabeth.
WIth humble hearts and faithful minds,
assemble all and pray,
And sing high laud, unto our God,
whose goodness to display,
Surm^untes the sense of mortal he^
to glorify the same:
With such deserts as rightly longes,
unto his blessed name.
Oh England, joy thou little I Will,
in prayers do not cease:
Both day and night give laud to God,
for this thy happy peace,
Inioyed under Perelesse Prince,
Eizabeth thy Queen:
Whose quiet reign declares that God,
his blessing would have seen,
Upon her grace and eke her realm,
the which O Lord preserve:
With Seemly Cepter in her Throne,
thy Gospel to conserve.
From foreign foe, and faithless friends,
from all that mischiffe works:
Lord break the brood of Enuies wyles,
in secretie that loorkes.
Lay open to her Princly view,
all tho se that faithless be
In thought against her Majesty,
Lord let her highness see.
We must confess unfeignedly,
we have deserved thy ire:
We daily lord, be prompt to sin,
small goodness we require.
Yet have compassion on our land,
and do the same defend:
From those which under show of friends,
their malice do pretend.
Unto our Queen which reigned has,
this three and twenty years:
In peacable Tranquillity,
as well to us appears.
God grant Her highness Nestors years
over this Realm to Rain,
Amen, Amen, for Jesus sake,
amen: we do not fame.
God preserve with joyful life, our Gracious Queen Elizabeth.
In the Commendation of a Godly and Virtuous Matron.
AS I alone did walk in fields,
I heard a thundering voice:
Which did descend from lofty skies
whereof I stood in choice,
For to con^ecture with my self
what voice should be the same:
It answered me as I it heard,
I am the flying fame.
Which farther said, take pen in hand
and prove thy simple skill:
To blaze abroad a Matrons life
whose mind does mean no ill. The (...) cries it self and needs no
Commendation.

Her Virtuous life adorned is
with Godly zeal and grace:
Lucrese if she were alive
she could it not deface.
No day does pass this Matrons hands
in any idle sport:
She to the Church to serve her God
in due time does resort.
If any wight shall purchase heaven
for Godly life well spent:
Fame told me that should be she,
high Jove did so assent.
And to conclude, if graftes of grace
do grow in any wight:
Then in the Hind you may be bold
they shine with virtue bright.
Thus much as Fame commanded me
I have here put in (...):
With hearty prayers to the Lord
her life may long endure.
Heavenly Happiness is Due to the Hind.
In the Commendation of a Dame,
IF skill did rest within my head,
or Poets cunning art:
Then would I prove to write her praise
agreeing to her part.
But Ladies if you do deride
and scorn a willing mind:
Dame wisdom does not teach you that,
but Momus mocking kind.
For sooth the gallantst of you all.
that be of Dians flock:
May seem to let her have a room
without dispight or mock.
For why? her favor is as sweet,
her Beauty is as fair:
As any Dame in Dian^ Court,
I rightly may compare.
Yea Chaste she lives I tell you true
in spite of Cupids (...)
A Virtuous (...) she does deserve
if duty may require.
Foeli^ was not more faithfuller
unto his friend in heart:
Then she is true unto her make,
her virtue has desert.
Which long the Lord preserve and keep
with his defending hand:
From faithless friends and fauning foes
whose trust does truthlesse stand.
Praise is a preferring of the party: though needelesse.
In the Praise of a virtuous Gentlewoman.
IF Virtue praise gain by desert:
Or constant stay, or faithful mind:
Good Ladies let me in this part
Some thing Declare for faithful kind,
Let not my pen rebuked be,
Though simple skill do rest in me.
But give me leave for to declare
And speak my mind without offense.
Such duty I unto her bear,
As trust me this is my petence:
To write some thing although I see,
Unablenesse which rests in me.
A Lady I obey and serve
With heart and mind and only will:
Who has done more then I deserve,
For which I am her servant still,
To wish her well since wealth is small,
And wishing i^ the most of all.
But if that within^ could advance,
My wishing should not come behind:
But wishing i^ a (...) chance.
Although we wish yet want we find,
Wherefore to wish it is but vain,
When as we wish and not atta^ne.
If Courteous nature be on ground
It is in her I dare depose:
Whose grafted Impes of grace are sound,
As virtuous buodes at large disclose.
Whose fragrant life, like Woodbine flower
May seem to deck a Matrons bower.
I shall not need to name her name:
But privately in fostering breast:
I mean for to observe the same
With former mind, and so I rest.
Whose life I wish, whose joy I crave,
Till breath from corpse death does deprave.
In the praise of Fennill and Woodbine.
IN garden brave, when as I viewed and saw
There every herb, that nature had bedeckt,
And every flower so fresh and red as Haw:
I stood in choice of which I should elect:
Yet could I none there find that did me please,
So much as two, by whom I have found ease.
And Fennill first for sight has done me good,
Whose water Styled did ease my pricking eyes,
Revived my heart and cheered my fainting blood,
And made me laugh when head was full of cries.
What say you now, can you expulsse my clause,
May I not pra^^e: yes sir when I have cause.
Yes sure this ^earbe I like and like again
And i^ I had a garden as some have,
I would much plant, and take therein great pain,
To have in store for such as will it crave.
Yet some will say, that Fennill is to slatter:
They over, each, their tongues too much do clatter,
The Woodbine lea^e, is good to ease the thorte,
Or pame in mouth that comes by cronanes in drink:
I have it tried, I do not lie, for note:
Sees thou the leaves in water as I think,
And wash thy mouth and thou shall find such ease,
As will no doubt the former pain appease.
For these same two, I pray to God from heart,
Their hewes may stand, in happy state and prime,
And boysterouse winds may blow from them apart,
Who do good, though sillily they clyme.
As help I find, so help I ought to praise,
That help may help, when help shall need always.
Of a friend in prosperity, and a foe in adversity.
THat morning which so brave does shine
with Phoebus glistering face:
Ear darksome night approached is,
a shower does it disgrace.
And yet Sir Phoebus gallant hew
in morning did displaye:
Who seemed to promise by aspect,
to burnish out the day.
Even so of double hearted friends
I rightly do compare:
Which show a pleasant face until,
his friend be caught in care:
And then as dimming of the Sun,
does change the former hue:
So does a double faced fr^end,
return again a new.
From faithful friendship which as he,
by promise should not do:
But those that can dissemble Sir,
they know what longs thereto.
But whilst thou art in prosperouse state,
and vo^d of Fortunes lowre:
Then will they seem to be thy friends,
in pleasant words each hour.
But when Adversity that wretch,
has caught thee in his snare:
Their friendship is forgotten then,
of thee they have no care.
Wherefore who trustes a smiling face,
may chance to be beguylde:
And he that touches pich they say,
shall there with be defiled.
A perswation patiently to suffer Affliction.
TO mortal wightes what praise more due,
then patiently to bear:
Such crosses and afflictions,
as Time does bring with care.
For sure it is a happy thing,
for those that can uphold,
And Patiently to bear ill happes:
that Fatal Fates vnfeld.
So shall they find it best in end,
as sequel just does try:
And eke advance their name with praise,
Experience does not lie.
But as for such as seem to rave,
for loss of worldly mucke:
They are unhappy in that case,
I pity much that luck.
For truth to tell I may be bold:
I know not which is be,
That Patiently does bear his loss,
for ought that I can see.
But that he says fie on this hap,
the world does frown on me:
I am not luckie unto it,
oh spitfull misery.
What mortal man can more be plagued,
then have such losses still:
What sorrow comes by this despite,
alas it is too ill.
What braules do broile within my head,
what griping griues do nippe:
What yerkes of worldly loss I feel,
which smarteth like a whippe.
But worldling thou content thy self.
remember Christ did take:
A percing spear into his side,
and all was for thy sake.
And can not thou provoke thy m^ode,
to bear a little smart:
And take thy cross and follow Christ,
to win thee heavens Desert.
And patiently with penitent mind,
unto the Lord to pray:
That he would of his goodness great,
defend thee night and day.
Wherefore this my advise I give
in sickness or in health:
In loss of fame in loss of friends,
or loss of worldly wealth.
Or loss of loss, that haplessy.
unto thy state may fall:
In any loss lose not the Lord,
but on him still do call,
That it would please him thee to send,
in midst of hardest hap:
A merry heart to praise his name,
and joyful hands to clappe.
How Time erecteth and destroys.
When Musing mind had Fancy fed
to cogitate of Time,
And I beholding then such things
as pleasant, were in prime,
And that the thing is come to pass,
which I nere thought should be:
Then straight way to my self I said,
behold now may ye see,
How Time has wrought, by Tract of Time,
such things as to the show,
Did seem unlikely for to be,
as very well I know.
For there are some of low degree,
and Progeny but base:
Are now come up and set aloft,
did not Time do this case?
Yes surely beliue me now,
for Time can mountains move:
And Time does work much things that seem,
unlikely for to prove.
Within my time I have often seen,
great things and many strange:
And daily do still more and more.
as Time does work a change.
For Time will soften flinte so hard,
by Time some do aspyre,
To win the thing to please the mind,
and get their hearts desire.
And if their hearts Desire be got,
thank hap and Time therefore:
If these same two do fail our friends,
our purpose Gets no more.
As Time has brought many full low^
that were full high in hap:
So Time diffused has their state,
that Fortune did bewrap.
She altered has most Famous things
that some set up for Fame:
And did not think of Time I think
when they began the same,
But thought it should remain for aye
and Time could not deface:
Such Monuments as they set up
to get a goodly grace.
But sooth to tell, Time with her Time
can every thing bestow:
And those that are so high aloft
she can bring down full low.
Time is Tickle.
Of a smiling Countenance beguilding the world.
A Goodly house that seems brave
and pleasant to the sight,
With walls set out in goodly form^
and windows trim of light,
May chance within for to have
a crack which is unseen,
And yet the world knows not so much
nor workman as I ween.
Even so forsooth such flearing mates
that show a smiling face:
I may compare them as before,
for why? mark well this case.
Thou see them laugh and smile on thee,
but what does rest in heart?
A mock or tawine behind thy back,
I know some play that part.
And yet they will look so faithfully
and seem so true to thee, A Parasites part.

And proffer out such sugared words
and show such courtesy,
I mean in this, by speaking fair,
but not in deeds Perdie:
Wherefore take heed trust not their show
there may be Treachery.
An Apple seeming brave to view,
may faulty be within:
And Pewterers may play thee false,
by putting lead in Tin.
And he that writes, may place A. H.
where as A. G. should serve:
But Truth to tell A. F. were best,
for some do it deserve.
And under fresh and fragrant Rose
may lie a loathsome Toad:
For to infect that flower brave
by having there abode.
Wherefore I count them happy sure
that do not trust the use:
Of Tickle flattering flearing friends,
in them does rest abuse.
Let these examples put before
suffice to show the kind,
Of Truthlesse troth, which ready is
in each deceiptfull mind.
No Foe to a Flatterer.
When as occasion moves,
To answer it behooves.
WHen urgent cause does move,
who can withhold his hand:
The Worm when she is trodden on
does seem for to withstand.
The Owl of ugly hue,
does think her vir^es are best:
The miser pincheth at his feast,
although he bids his gh^st.
The winds that rise in skies
do threaten surges sore:
And tatling tales do move Debate
where none was meant before.
The valiant Champion Stout,
which has a Victors mind:
Does think there is none so good as he,
until by proof he find. An old saying: The fool will not leave his Babble
for the Tower of London.

The fop and fauning fool
does like his babble so:
As for the Tower of great price,
he will not let it go.
The Scholar young in school,
may prove a learned Clarke:
The whelpe by Natures kind we see,
is given for to bark.
The Scholar though but young
has wrote this verse to those.
Which pleases for to answer him
in Meeter or in prose.
But truth for to unfold,
some love to prattle much:
And find three faults, yet mend not one,
yea Minstrelles often be such.
At every dog which barks. If one should throw a stone at every Curre (...)
barks, his Arm must needs be weary.

if one should throw a stone:
Perchance in end he would have wished
to let such Curs alone.
Hard hap causes sorrow,
and breeds disrest:
Where grief is not absent
notes solemn are best.
LIke as the Carren Crow
does cry against the rain:
So I which do foresee my grief
begin for to complain.
Or as the snared Hare,
lies tumbling in the net:
So I lie tumbling in my woe,
which I cannot forget.
For why, no neysome news
does glad the heart of man:
But does revoke his pleasures all
on sorrows for to skan.
I see how spiteful Care
does look out of her bower:
And Fortune with her smiling face
begins for to lowre.
The mistie clouds of grief
do dim my cleerest sight:
And hapless hap does take the place
to work my deep despite.
The sweet and pleasant sentes,
which I was wont to taste:
Be clean dismissed and put away.
my pleasures all do wast.
The fine and flagrant smells,
which did me recreate:
Be noisome savors unto me,
and work me much Debate.
Sir Phoebus glistering hue,
seems nothing in my eyes:
For why, I weep and spend the day,
with sorrowing sobbes and cries.
No marvel though I write,
with pensive pen in hand:
No marvel though I wail in deed,
when things be rightly skand.
And mark now which be they,
that do oppress me most:
Deride me not, though plain I tell,
you heads of finest cost.
Lo thus I do begin,
they are in number three:
The first of them, is loss of friends,
the next discurtesie.
The third is not believe,
the spitfullest of all:
Which griues me more then former two,
and bitter seems as gall.
But well, what remedy,
Plain patience is the best:
For why by her, we daily see,
is got most quiet rest.
What does it boot the ship,
to sail against the wind:
She must abide, for Time and Tide,
else tarry still behind.
Or else perchance she drinks,
for enterprise so bold:
And lays her ribs in foaming sea^^,
of waters wanne and cold.
What does it eft prevail,
to strive to reach the sky?
In my conceipte, it were but vain,
least some for it do cry.
What though that smyling words,
has led me on the bit?
Some froward speech shall loose the bond,
if luckie chance so hit.
A Proverb long ^ go,
tells Fair words makes fools feign:
Which Sentence tries it self in me,
the more has been my pain.
I stand to try my Chance,
as Fortune will alo^te:
To see if that she white thee read,
or dim it with a blot.
And if she be so kind,
to take the blot away:
Then will I sing some joyful song,
in praise of that good day.
But if that it be so,
the blot do still remain:
What remedy but Patience she,
must medicine be for pain:
But if that spite will spitte,
her spite in furiouse wise:
Let all the spites do what they will,
or what they can surmise.
For by my Troth I am,
as the condemned wight:
Which thinks his life is past release,
and void is of delight.
So I am void of joy,
yet laugh I with the best:
And smile it out in pleasant hu^,
as well as do the rest.
But what of that, I know
there is many a smiling face:
Bears heavy heart, in Careful Corpse,
which causes their disgrace.
Some laugh outwardly,
Yet sorrow inwardly.
A Glass for Amorouse Maidens to look in, friendly framed as a caveat for a
light believing Maiden: which she may take as a requisite rebuke, if she
modestly meditate the matter.
FIE, Maiden fie, that Cupids flames,
within you so abound:
To trust the tatling tales of some,
whose words prove often unsound?
Should every knave entice you so,
to talk with you at will?
What be your wits so simple now,
and of such little skill?
As you can not discern in mind,
who leads you on the bit?
Fie, fie for shame, now leave it off
it is a thing unfit.
I promise you it griues me sure,
because I am your friend:
That every Jack should talk with you, Let Jack be a Jack I pray you.

and it is to no end.
But for to feel and grope your mind,
and then they laugh in sleeue:
And say it is a gentle maid.
how she will men believe.
Thus do the knaves so cogge and foyst,
and count you as a fool:
And say your wits they be so base,
as you may go to school.
Wherefore love no such steering Iackes,
and give to them no ear:
And think this lesson to be true,
which I have written here.
For well in Time you shall it find,
to breed in you unrest: Good counsel would not be refused.

Wherefore to leave it of at first,
I think it were the best.
Give not your mind to be enticed,
to hear each tatling tale,
Where constant heads do not abide,
what Hope does there avail:
You will not warned be I see,
until you have a nippe:
You know ^he horse which draws in cart,
is ever nigh the whippe.
But when too late, you do repent,
repentance will not serve:
Wherefore foresee, in time I warn,
from fa^lie fond to swerue.
Take heed I say in time therefore,
so shall your state be blessed:
And I shall cease, to write so much,
my pen shall take his rest.
A praise of friendship.
OF all the Iuels under heaven,
firm friend^hipe is the best:
Oh happy man, that finds the same,
yea tw^se and double blessed.
A trusty friend is hard to find
as Sages old do tell:
But flattering friends attend at hand
some profit out to smell.
And when for greediness of gaiu
his friend he does forsake:
That friendship is not faithful fixed,
but as the lurking Snake
Lies hidden up in leaves so green,
to sting a man unawares:
Even so a fauning friend is found
to leave a man in cares.
But faithful friendship says to him
thou do declare thy kind:
Thou show thy nature and thy mood,
and eke thy truthles mind.
O faithful friendship, high in hap
thou do no time Dissemble:
Thou swaruest not in time of need,
though foes could make thee tremble.
Thou stand like a steadie rock,
though friend be linked in chains:
And if thou may expulse his thralles
thou think it happy pains.
And to redress him of his greenes,
and liberty to get:
Such is thy faith and constanci^
as charge no time can let.
Such is a faithful friend indeed,
but for a friend by shows:
He is a friend but flatteringly
as well his conscience knows.
A faithful friend is never tried
till (...) be near the brinke:
And that his friend is like to fall,
and if he then do shrink:
That friend will bear the name no more
of faithful friend I say:
But counted as a fleeting friend
wherein there is no stay.
There are many kinds of friends god knows,
more then I can well name:
The^e are friends in words and not in deeds,
and friends that fail with shame.
And friends by former promise true
till stone is roulde on neck:
And then Godboy, they cannot stay,
but seed thee with a beck.
Such is the friendship of this world:
O Lord a faithful friend,
Is rare to find, and dainty sure
to have unto the end.
For faithful friends were never more
in scarcity then now:
Nor never harder for to find,
to God I make a vow.
For I my self not long a go,
by raunging wise did try,
What seeds were sown in frie^dships ground,
and where the chaste did lie.
And as the trial tells the truth,
even so I have found out:
To settle things within my thought,
which I tofore did doubt.
For why? that friend that laughes on thee
is not a friend in heart:
But outwardly he seems thy friend
and inwardly the smarte.
And suckes thee as the lurking Drone
which does beguild the ^ee:
So he lies linking in his den
some sp^te to work to thee
And yet with fauning smiling looks.
he laughes upon thee so:
To bleare thy eyes, as who should say
he cannot be thy so.
But trust him not for his fair looks,
ne for his glosing vain:
But utterly detest such mates,
as flatter, fleare, and feign.
The greatest hap that God does send,
is faithful friends to have:
Whose constant stay does not decline,
till vital breath deprave.
Alas some kind of friends I know,
when state impouerisht sore:
Do scornefully look of that hap,
and know their friends no more.
But faithful friendship does not use
to fleet and fall away:
He says I am a faithful friend,
and so I mean to stay.
He does not say it so in words,
but deeds approve it true:
A faithful friend is faithful still,
as we may daily view.
Wherefore of faithful friendship here,
this little Epigram:
By urgent cause did move my mind,
and so it hither came.
And as of it in skillesse wise
I some thing here have said:
So of just Dealing and Constancy,
shall somewhat be displaied.
As I do hope no grudging mind
shall murmr at the same:
But if they do, the faults not mine,
for those that haunt that game,
Constantly leave, although they know
they offer open wrong:
Well what of that, the time shall try
their trusty truth ere long.
But this I say, who so does find
a friend that is a friend:
Then use him so as thou may have
his friendship to the end.
A Praise of Just Dealing.
TO live in world and not deal just,
a heinous fault it is:
A crime which God does not allow
to come in seat of bliss.
For why? to live Deceiptfully
is loathsome in the sight,
Of sacred God that si^s on high
as Judge of^ Prudent might
Be just in all thy dealings sure,
so shall thou purchase Fame:
And win the praise of every wight,
as worthy is the same.
For dealing just does carry laud
in thought of honest mind:
And lauding just will be allowed,
as truth has it assigned.
Preace not among Deceiptfull mates
thy honest name to loose:
Ne leap thou yet in da^ngerous place
least thou thy self do^t broose.
But leap upright, and swerve thou not
ne lean no more then just:
For if thou wrongfully be spied
deceiptfully to thrust:
Then shall thou loose thy credit quite
not coming in the place:
Where as just dealing does abide,
but rooted out of race.
In dealing just thy doings shall,
so prosper and uphold:
As all the world will lend thee praise,
on it thou may be bold.
And God will bless thee in the same,
and furtherance thee send:
For who so justly seems to deal,
does never God offend.
For why the just and honest man,
his hands are clasped still:
He takes no bribes for to make good,
a matter which is ill.
He says, if bribes that I should take,
I do not then deal just:
I do offend my maker sore,
of truth confess I must.
I shall be called unto accounte,
before the living God:
Who deals as we give desert,
his dealing is not odd.
And if I wretch have not dealt just,
what answer shall I make:
Oh how can I excuse my self,
but fault upon ^e take.
Thus says the just and honest man,
thus pondereth he in mind:
Thus must it be and thus it is,
so God has it assigned.
And since by him commaundment is,
no lucer for to take:
My hands they shall be clasped so,
unjust life none to make.
I (...) not of a scrupulouse kind,
so thus just dealing says:
Although that I derided be,
of those that use those ways.
I do defy them with my heart,
they shall not lodge with me:
But be accounted as they are,
for ought that I can see.
The righteouse man does them exclude,
and puttes them out of mind:
He does eschew their company,
he forces not their kind.
He says I am as ill as they,
if I uphold their state:
Wherefore with willing heart I swear,
O Lord I them do hate.
God let me never live (says he,)
vniust'y for to deal:
But grant me grace for justness I
may unto thee appeal.
And when I shall yield up my life,
a just account to make:
How that with justice I have dealt
all briberie to forsake.
For doubt we not, our heavenly God
has mercy still in store:
And has abundance to supply,
our want though it were more.
But God forbid we should presume,
upon fond hope in vain:
It is the way to purchase hell,
remission none to gain.
For he that sins still in hope,
offendes the holy ghost:
And he that does offend that God.
shall vengeance feel with most.
For why the sin against that God,
as Scripture does declare:
Is more offensive then the rest:
So Paul does witness bear.
Wherefore God grant we not offend,
in no respect with will:
But with a heart unfeignedly
ask pardon for it still.
And crave of God, with faithful heart,
his mercy may us guide:
That when our life shall yield to death,
we may with him abide.
And there to laud thy name with praise,
which ever shall endure:
Grant this O Lord for Christ his sake,
whose blood made us all pure.
A praise of Constancy
THe constant wight which does possess,
that heavenly gift so rare:
Is happy sure and blessed of God,
to have it to his share.
For constancy is such a gift,
as does surmount the rest:
And much commended for the kind,
of rareness in the breast.
To have a fickle mind you know,
it makes often Debate:
And causes much Contentiouse tricks,
which Constancy does hate.
Wherefore I count him happy sure,
that does that gift embrace:
He is much bound to thank the Lord,
for that his happy case.
For Constancy is such a gift,
as sure it does excel:
All Ryotouse tricks and wanton toys
Constancy does expel.
For why such braggers as do run.
upon their giddie will:
Are in the end suffyc'd with pain,
and have on it their fill.
And paraduenture wish they would,
their mind had Constant been:
And not so rashly for to raunge,
in their devises thin.
For Rashness does no whit prevail,
when raging winds do blow:
The safest way to guide thy ship.
is sail to bear a low.
Experience tells and makes a proof
you see the silly snaile:
By slealing steps will get alofte,
and does to top prevail.
When Rashness lies under foot,
and cries O my bones:
And does repent him of his have,
with gryping greuouse groans.
I may well say if that he had,
with Constancy him pressed:
Then Rashness had not caused his hurt,
to breed his great unrest.
For Rashness is not Constancy
but giddiness of brain:
And misseth staying of his side
and furthers forth his pain:
And heapeth more mishaps on head
then pleasures do abound:
That gets giddie brains (I say)
by Rashness so unsound.
To be a Constant friend is rare:
a Constant lover true,
Deserves praise among the best
and worthy is in view.
In every thing to use this Dame
me thinks is passing sure:
And those that do not her inuest
have not a life so pure,
As I would wish (of God) they had
or eke I had my self:
For trust me true, the vain of it
cannot be bought with pel^e.
But God must be the giver (he)
of such a gift so hye:
As passes captious head of man,
in heavens it does lie.
And when with earnest zeal we pray,
God does us not reject:
But bendes his heavenly ears to hear,
and has of us respect.
Oh heavenly wightes that do embrace
this heavenly gift always:
No Rash advice does pass your hands,
all Illness you do stay.
But with a mild and modest mind
you foster every doubt:
And take those chances well in worth
which tune does bring about.
What wished hap can better be,
or what can please you more?
But for to wish and have at will,
where plenty is in store.
This plenteous place, that I do mean,
is up above in sky:
It restes in s^^te invisible,
yea frustrate from the eye.
Yet not so hard for to attain
if deeds according be:
A life well led in Godly fear,
does win that place we see.
If Anchor hold, and Cable strong,
be fastened on with faith:
That Hold shall not relent the Hold,
as holy Scripture says.
Wherefore if Constancy be placed
within thy breast so pure:
Give laud to God whose heavenly gifts
for ever shall endure.
A presumptuous Poesy for Pontifical pates.
LVcifer was once an Angel bright,
And had his room alofte in starry sky:
But hawe^ Disdain did put him thence to flight,
Thrown down he was as truth does testify,
And from an Angel, a Devil now is he:
Captain of Hell, and ever more shall be.
Which under him has a cursed crabbed crew,
For to torment all such whose due Desert:
Has gained the same most ugly things to view,
And has delight to pay their pains with smart.
The Proud (so vain) is hated for that vice:
A Deadly Sin disdained of the wise.
Medusa she, preferred so her Pate,
Prodigally with Golden lace to bind
Her hair on head: but mark the final Fate.
As she had wreathed y^ same in curious kind:
Even so the Snakes did wind about her head,
Tormenting her until that she was dead.
A right reward for such a proud Pretense.
Oh due Desert, rewarded very well,
Oh Peevish pride, thou art of much offense,
Thy Guerdon abydes in howling hell,
Where Lucifer chief general of the ^and,
Is ready there to shake thee by the hand.
High Jove no doubt will not abide the vain
Of vaunting heads that glory without cause:
Which inwardly do seem for to Disdain
Each simple soul. But stay a while and pause.
Behold their end, and tell me how they speed.
And you shall see their good success in deed.
Written upon the departure of Care.
AS Cruel Care
Wear does away,
And pinching pains
Refraines their place,
And inward woes
Grows to decay:
So mirth we find
Mind to solace.
The quiet life
Strife does refrain,
When heavy heart
Smarte does indu^e^
Then wailing woes
Show out their pai^^,
And glad if they
May find some cure.
We may be bold,
Cold is delight,
Where sower sorrow
Borrowe does a room:
She brings the brain
Disdain and spite,
With grief to pass
As some do doom.
Who sadly sets
Lets not to have
Most fearful fitts
Wits to a dull.
Who marks each cares,
Wears to his grave,
To Fatal fine
Resign he will.
With merrinesse
Express thy state:
And seek for joy
Annoy to kill,
And let thy mind
find to Probate
Such mirth as may
Defray each ill.
So shall thou be
Free from the care
Of Froward Fate
Hate to procure.
Thy mood and mind
Find shall that state:
Doubts will appease,
Ease to endure.
Care is costly.
Written upon Chance.
SOme Times a chance does chance,
by chance to please the mind:
Some times again, a chance does chance,
that no such chance we find.
If luckely there chance
a chance to thy delight:
Then I am sure that such a chance,
is joyful in thy sight.
If contrary wise a chance,
do chance to bring thee smart:
Then I am sure that such a chance,
is doleful to thy heart.
Yet must we be content,
as well in chance of care:
As we are pleased in chance of mirth,
or chance that brings no fear.
For chances have their chance,
like chances as they be:
And chance will chance as chance does please,
and so much chance for me.
Who seems to wrest with chance,
may chance for to repent:
That chance has so unkindly chaunc'd,
to chance to his lament.
Then is it best Perchance,
to be content with chance:
Wheather it does Decrease thy state,
or do thy state advance.
And ^ith of chance there is
such chance of tickle state:
In modest sort receive thy chance,
as well of mirth as hate.
For trust me touching chance,
it chances now a days:
That such as gape for chance of Laud,
they chance upon Dispraise.
It is a difficulte matter to please many.
HOw should a man his usage frame?
to please each kind of wight,
The froward and the fickle friend,
I see he takes delight.
In ouerthwarting of the use,
of those he does not love:
For where Affection is not firm,
what will not malice move.
Let one endeavor what he can,
to satisfy their vain:
Yet shall he have behind his back,
some speech to his disdain.
The more a man is moved to show,
some favor for his friend:
The more he seems to be quoy,
and fails in the end.
what hap more heard then sue and serve,
and yet to want good will:
What pain more pinching to the mind,
then wronged, yet does no ill.
What grief more great then secretly,
to be exclam'd upon:
What hell more hateful then untruth
where faithfulness is gone.
What folly more then fleare and faune,
yet altogether fayning:
What Deed more Deuilish then Dispight,
and always still Disdaining.
From such as do frequent the same,
the Lord my friend defend:
And eke convert the fond intent,
of those that do offend.
Yatis his song written presently after his coming from London.
Why should I laugh without a cause?
Or why should I so long time pause?
My hateful happes for to declare,
Since Cruel causes breeds my Care,
And Deuilish Disdain within my breast,
Molesteth me with great unrest?
Agree I must to Froward Fate
And be content with this my state:
Hoping in end all may be well,
For Prouerbe^ ^ld thus does us tell.
The Rolling ^one, does get no moss:
The raunger much does naught but tosie,
In places fit for madding minds,
Till youthful years the folly finds.
But when that Age (...) call them back,
And youthful tricks do find the lack:
Then do (...) our youth ill spent.
Which in our Age (...) do repent.
But such is youth, and youthful toys,
To follow fickle foolish joys.
How Fortune turns, we need not Muse,
For daily we may see in use,
How some are in great favor cast,
Yet in the end are out at last.
And small account of them is made.
Such is the guyse of Fortunes trade:
To place aloft, and to bring low,
Even as her favor seems to grow.
For who so marks shall see in deed,
Fortune to fail when most they need.
Content is best to please the mind
By seeking yet some men do find.
By crouching low, to hy estates,
Is good for to avoid their hates:
But he that has so stubborn heart,
As wilful will, will not convert:
He is not wise in my conceipte,
So much to stand in foolish slight.
The bowing Reed withstandes the blast,
When stubborn oak is ouercast.
If in this world we mean to live,
Such courteouse speech then we must give,
As we may win the hearts of those,
Which otherwise would be our foes.
For sinyling looks do not avail,
When friendship favor seems to quail.
The want whereof, does us molest,
With pinching pangues in private breast.
Yet from our heart let us require,
We may have patience in our ^re.
To pleasure such as we are bound,
That unto them our hearts be sound.
And that no feigned speech be heard,
Least all our doings so be mard.
For smiling looks and hollow hearts,
Be often tunes the cause of smarts.
But we must needs commend of Right,
All such as in the truth delight.
And say from heart and so consent,
It is a heaven to be content.
Of wayling, and not prevailing.
I Waylyng,
Yet not prevailing,
In sorrow sailing,
alas, I mourn:
Such is the spite
To dim delight
In me poor wight,
almost forlorn.
But God of grace
Grant me solace
Within short space,
to ease my grief:
And send release
Where woes increase,
I cannot cease
to crave relief.
For if the heart
Feels inward smart
Without Desert
Death it desires:
The grief of mind
Much woe does find
Their life resigned,
So some requires.
A Sonnet declaring what unfortunate chances do happen by trusting to the
slipperie stone.
I Clim'd aloft and thought not of my fall,
For slipperie stone alas did me beguilde:
I fell so hard upon the hardye hall,
As breath from Corpse was almost clean ex^lde.
Lo, what it is to yield to wanton will,
Whose want of wit to sorrow proves at last:
Who would asspire may wish he had sat still,
And so avoid perchance an over cast.
Yet youthful toys of giddy youth are such,
Not for to care until the present time
That grief they feel, and then lament they much,
That fondly they so Rashly seemed to clime:
Wherefore the mean, who so observes in breast,
Shall surely see he winnes a quiet rest.
A Sonnet of a slanderous tongue.
OF all the plagues that rain on mortal wig^tes.
Yet is there none like to a slanderous tongue:
Which brings Debate, and filles each heart with spights,
And Enemy is, as well to old as young.
In my conceit they do more hurt I swear
Then stinking Toads that loathsome are to ^ighte:
For why? such tongues cannot conceal and beare^
^ut vtte^ (...) that which works most Despite.
They do more (...) casting Mooles in mead^,
Which do turn up the black earth on the green
Their poisoned speech does serve in little stead,
They practice spite, as daily it is seen.
O Lord I pray from singleness or heart,
Such slanderous tongues, reform, and eke conue^^.
Written at the Request of E. L. Unto F. S. which he had Selected for his
Mistress.
IF I a Poet were, or that vain I could find,
I would declare some part of simple skill:
To show abroad the lowly courteous kind,
Which seems to be within my Mistress will.
Accepting so my service in good part,
Although as yet it is not my Desert.
But lo, as Time I say, each thing does try,
Even so shall Time declare I will not sweru^:
But always will my service so apply,
As that I may your favor still deserve,
Which is the thing I chiefly do Desire,
No worldly wealth at your hands I require.
And as you find my service to be true:
So I do trust your favor shall remain,
Which takes joy your presence for to view,
And glad if I through Diligence may gain
The loving countenance of your friendly face,
Which glads my mind, and yeeldes my heart solace.
You courteously did yield to my request,
And gave me leave you Mistress for to call:
Which thing to praise, my pen shall do his best,
Although my skill unable be, and small.
But Ladies all, a praise you may assign,
Yea and give place unto this Mistress mine.
And if you be destrous for to know
My Mistress name, or eke Sir what she is:
Her Christian name begins with F. (I trow,
Her surname. S. orel^ I am amiss.
But I will swear and vow Permafoy,
She is as fair, as was Hellina of Troy.
Alas my pen unable is to write
The virtues all that seem in her to be.
Oh mighty Jove which yeeldest bear^^ly light,
Grant her long time her happy days to see.
And though my verse be not framed as the best,
Yet (...) her^, and so I mean to rest.
Still and will:
Till death me kill.
The Careful Complainte of a Dolorous Dame.
YOu Virgins pure of heart, come mourn in doleful wise,
Help me to sing this beauie song, let plaints asce^d y^ skies.
Oh pity you my hap, that now does live in thrall,
(...) tofore was void of it and played with pleasures ball.
(...) those which once were well, and could not thereof see.
Must taste some sorrow for their mirth, and so it is with me.
The fall of strately Troy, did not so much men grieve,
As does the fall of my good hap in thraldom now to live.
Nor yet the Aetna hills burns not more worse with fire:
Then I do burn in flames of fear, yet void of my Desire.
Wher^fore Oh wail with me, Oh wail you worthy Dames,
Desire of God I may have help to qu^ch my fretting flames.
Oh if I had the skill of Dedalus his art,
With wings I would devise to fly to void me of this smart.
Or if that I could rule, as Juno (Goddess she:)
Then would I make them feel of grief, that so agreeueth me.
But since it may not be, I waste my life in tears,
With soking sighs I spend the day, and so my life it wears.
If pity planted were, within his cruel breast,
Then he might soon redress my greeues and yield me quiet rest.
He cancel can my cares, he can enforce my joy,
He may surcease all these my wrongs which breeds my great Anoy,
But where as Boysterouse Winds, do bear such fo^ce and sway
It is in vain to hoyse your sail least that the ship decay.
You know the sailing ship mus^ tarry wind and tide,
She can not sail, why then no doubt of force she must abide:
So I that would fame go, do want a ^ight release,
Wherefore I see I (...) abide though sorrows do increase.
My joys they vade awa^^, and wither does my will,
The greenesse of my young delights, is fear with inward ill.
Well, well, what remedy, since chanced so do fall,
But Patiently them for to bear, and be content withal.
Yet still I hope the best, though present help I want,
For why? it restes in ^oue his power some pleasure for to plant
Within my broosed breast, that almost is consumed,
With greedy grief, and cruel care, that has me so perfumed.
Care is costly.
An Epitaph upon the death of Master Poolies wife of Badly.
YOu Dames leave off your bootlesse tears,
Whose vain complaints can do no good,
Since cruel Death has forced your scares,
And stricken such a noble blend.
And though you wail and weep your fill,
Yet you can not revive your will.
For if high ^oue does so permit,
That Dreedfull Death shall strike with dart,
It is in vain to mourn for it,
Since he can joy, and he can smart:
He can graun^ life, he can grant death,
He can bereave each Prince of breath.
This worthy Matron wrapped in clay,
Was wife to Master Pooly she:
Whose noble race for to display, She was sister (...) to my Lady Wentworth.

My wit unable is I see.
Alas my pen is nothing ryfe,
For to Declare her ve^uouse life.
Wherefore twere vain to pen her praise,
Since it abroad in world is known.
Alas, that death did end her days,
And has her life so over thrown.
Wherefore to mourn, it is in vain,
Since you no more her can attain.
Given unto Mistress F. W. when she Went to wait.
TO wait on Noble Dames,
much attendance it does crave:
And searches out in each respect,
the service that you hau^.
Attendance you must dance,
in chamber all the day:
And not to walk abroad in fields,
if truth Report does say.
Except my Lady go,
then you must wait on her:
Or else to keep the chamber still,
and not abroad to stir.
And when she plays at cards,
down kneel you must on knees:
An so to sit there all the Time,
until she win or leese.
Oh God this is no life,
of Pleasure as I think:
To wait in chamber all the day,
till sleep do make you wink.
But Paraduenture you
do think Preferment there:
Will hoyse you up to be aloft,
and set you void of care.
I do not I, say nay,
for it is like to be:
And I as glad as any one,
that happy day to see.
Thus gentle Mistress mine,
The Gods keep you in rest:
And grant such pleasures to abound,
as sorrows not molest.
Of one who had vitiously spent his Patrimony.
IF shriking plaintes of bitter breast,
may yerce the lofty sky:
Or heavy happes of Fortunes lore,
that happen so awry:
Then come draw ^y, good minded wille^,
and mark this mournful verse:
Lend willing ears to hear short tale,
the which I shall rehearse.
It chanced so by wanton will,
a man that was in Prime:
Whose witless race, did not regard^,
for substance of his time.
But vainly he did spend his wealth,
in hugling pleasures sweet:
Yea not regarding honest lore,
ne sober life discreet.
He was worth thousands by (...),
this man in London soil:
Who there does spend his doleful days,
ashamed of his foil.
His younger Brother now (...),
by taking honest Pain:
For to disspend by land a (...),
an hundred pound certain.
Oh Shameless Savage elder thou,
what shame falls to thy share:
Sweet minching Dames have pulled thee so,
as clothes are skant to wear.
Happy is he whom other men's harms do make to be^^^^.
The wounded wight thus complayneth.
NO joy I feel since care does gripe my heart,
No hapless hap, could happen more amiss:
Then for to live in place of fear and smart,
And spend my days where as no pleasure is.
Such is the hap I see for me assigned,
And for such hap, I wish my life resigned.
I being well and void quyte of this snare,
Could not take heed, but headlong run therein,
Must for such have, content my self with care,
And take my hap, since I did it begin.
For where I was, I lived and was well eased,
Yet not content, my mind was no so pleased,
If I were there, and absent from this place,
I do believe, I would not fast return:
Since I do feel my coming works disgrace
Within my mind, and makes my heart to burn.
As pleasant springes, which spring in others soil
Must quench the heat, which in my breast does boil.
Unto which springs, God grant I may repair
To cool my heat, and set my heart at rest:
To ease this mind, now dying in Despair,
And help to joy my heart which is oppressed.
I crave this sum, with wet and waterie eyes
With soaking sighs, and shriking voice to skies.
It Is wisdom some do tell,
To know when we are well:
And so to rest Content,
Least that we do repent.
Not Beauty but Bounty.
THe Prime of years delights in Beauties blaze,
And much esteems the seemly show thereof:
The pleasant hue inforceth many a gaze,
To feed the eye on Dames, that love to scoff.
But who can tell what gain such Fancy breeds,
Or what reward for due Deserte they get.
With fruitful grain, we see there comes up weeds,
And gasing eyes are soonest over set.
Yet truth to tell, it is a bayte Perdie,
Which does entice the wisest wights of all:
For well we see, experience does not lie,
They ready are to come when so they call.
But I must say, though Beauty likes it least,
Dame Bounty sure, in my conceit is best.
Dame Bounty sure in my conceit is best,
And so of truth I may uphold for true:
For Beauty serves for to entice a ghest
To spend his Coin, as well some do it view.
When Bounty bids Expense to shut his door,
And opens hers for to prepare with speed,
With liberal hand to give unto the poor
And meanest souls, which stand in greatest need.
Does Beauty so? no, no, I think not much,
For all is skant to prancke her up in pride:
Some vain Desires we see are always such,
To have delight in bravery to abide.
To shine in show like Phoebus beams so bright,
Which solace sendes to every worldly wight,
Which solace sendes to every worldly wight,
And yet perchance great ruth thereby does fall:
Some foolish fond will drink their own Despite,
That proves in taste as bitter as the gall.
But let such mates as meddle in that lore,
Abide the smart, and feel the worst for me:
Yet some are grieved to see what grief therefore,
Is got unawares, a mean to misery.
For trust me true, who more esteems the hue
Of Beauties badge, then Bounties liberal hand:
Has not the hap that Good luck might renew.
Nor half the skill the case to understand.
Nor yet does s^e the charge, the coile and cost,
That Beauty bringes, yet in the end is lost.
That Beauty bringes, yet in the end is lost.
O Lord why then do worldlings so delight
In that which is as well a Care as Lost,
The gain they got, a simple Clarcke may wright.
Oh Bounty thou, that Bountifully do give
Of cost full free and never do repine:
Poor Simple I, am thine while I do live,
Fall back, fall edge till Fall my Fatal fine.
I will remain thy servant ready pressed,
Yea ready sure at thy command to be:
Though Beauty blaze, yet Bounty is the best,
And liked of for liberallitie.
Bounty does give when Beauty does retain,
To Prancke her self with Pride, that is but vain.
To Prancke her self with Pride, that is but vain.
For that's the way for to maintain her gloss:
What forces she though others feel the pain,
She sure is, she tastes o^ no loss.
Does Bounty bind her Bounteous liberal hand,
Or does she force of coin to keep in store?
No, no in deed, if truth be justly skand,
She rather lettes it fly at loose the more.
The Bounteous Dame esteems not the show
Of Beauties blaze, that glistereth to the eye:
Some say Deceit does rest therein they know,
Experience tells, and trial does it try.
Wherefore to say now as my Theme does move,
Not Beauty sure, but Bounty I do prove.
Not Beauty sure, but Bounty I do prove.
In this respect perchance I shall offend
The Beautiful Dame, to malice I shall move,
Because I seem her for to discommend,
And do prefer Dame Bounty in her place,
But bear with me my Theme pertaines thereto,
You gallant Dames whose hue Declares your grace,
Conceive no ill for writing as I do.
For of my truth, if Theme had thus been said,
Not Bounty Sir, but Beauty bears the bell:
I must have then her praise at full displayed,
To write wherein Dame Beauty does excel.
I hope I have no Courteous Dame offended,
For God does know I never so intended.
A presumption of the Courtesy of Fortune.
THough Fortune frown, and look with lowering face
Upon my state to move me to dispite;
Though she often seem to galle me with Disgrace,
And is the cause of dimming my delight:
Yet I presume, as she does work annoy,
In double wise she can advance my joy.
And though I am thus spent with pensive breast,
Constrained to lodge the looks of lowering hue
In sullen soil, although enforced to rest,
And kept in place where sorrow does renew:
Yet as the bird does joy at her release,
So will I joy when cares begin to cease.
No wight I know but subject is to Fate,
Since Destiny from birth ordaines it so:
What happy wight that never feels hate,
Or finds the place where Pleasure still does flow.
Which place confused has ever been to me,
And still refrained that pleasant place to see.
Before my eyes I veiwe great heaps of hap,
Which big do seem, and yet I take no hold:
I see how some are lul'd in Fortunes lap,
And wrapped warm for fear of catching cold.
But I at large unbraced am, you see,
And open lie to take in Misery.
Well, as I said, I do presume on this,
That Fortunes face at length will change her frown:
And all such cares from me she may dismiss,
Which heretofore my pleasant state did drown
In wretched waves, which moved me to mourn,
And often say: fie of that life forlorn.
Of Hope.
TO live in Hope is help,
But Hope which feeds too long:
And bringes no help until Distress,
Is rooted in among.
Then fie of lingering Hope,
That feeds our fancy so:
Yea fie of Hope again I say,
When Hope bringes help to woe.
I hope, I hope in deed,
I hope what may befall:
I hope perchance more then is cause,
It Is that which marreth all.
Yet such are musing minds,
To make of Hope a God:
Which say we Hope all shall be well,
And nothing shall be od.
But ah, that helpelesse Hope,
It Is that which I do blame:
Which hates help, and heapeth woe,
Oh fie ou that for shame.
Yet still to Hope some be,
In bondage and in thrall:
By whom they Hope for to have help,
When so it does befall.
Hope is help.
Of a happy exchange.
Leave of to muse my friends,
for to behold my state:
I lived once in deep Disdain,
my heart did burn in hate.
The Tediouse toyling time.
of my tormoyling days:
Brought sorrow inwardly to sink,
whose fittes a thousand ways,
Molested so my mind,
bereaved so my rest:
As often times I did accounte,
my self to be unblessed.
And pondering with my self,
how usual constraint:
Enforced me to seek some mean,
my greeues for to depaint.
Then see how fortune fond,
for me o^d put in ure:
A faling out not by Desert,
for me she did procure.
Whereby I had just cause,
each thing considered right,
To shake off belles whose sound was greef^,
and prove another flight.
And see if that I could,
provide so for my ill:
As that contempt of my conceipte,
did not offend me still.
Not like the mounting Dorre,
which buzzeth up on hy:
And falls Down (an homely tale)
and all to be, does lie.
For some do change in hope,
of better hap and place:
Yet find it works such is ill luck,
a lamentable case.
But I may vaunte and say,
more then I could before:
I have my pleasure but too much,
and what does youth wish more.
Some profit eke withal,
is matched for her mate:
The countinance of cheerful hue,
me thinks does bless by state.
The quietness of mind,
the fearful fear excluded:
The fond surmyses of my head,
with odiouse oaths deluded.
So much does me rejoice,
that all things past and done:
As to my self often times I say,
me thinks I heaven have won.
For those which always have,
been pent in private pain:
When as they have release thereof,
they double think their gain.
Lo thus I do conclude,
in this my skillesse style:
And thank the Lord whose goodness great,
has helped my exile.
Of the Mutabillitie of this world.
OH wavering world, unconstant and unkind,
Oh drudge to droyle and driuell to the mind.
Oh toil, oh pain, oh how by travel tossed:
Oh waves of woe, that work so for the most.
Oh hard to please, and ready to offend,
Oh quick to sin, and slowly to amend.
Oh prompt to speak, our friend for to disease,
Oh flacke to help, but quickly to displease.
Oh ears to hear each tatling tale us brought,
Oh tongue to taunt whereby is mischief wrought.
Oh gruppilouse minds desirouse to have gain,
Oh hazardes hard, which harbors in the brain.
Oh how we are by fickle Fancy led,
Oh how we seek to have our humor fed.
Oh how we hark and listen unto tales,
Oh ignorance, how she bringes us unto bales.
Oh how we sigh, when as we feel the smart,
Oh how before we think not of that part.
Oh how this world, by Mutabillitie,
Does often change and bringes much misery.
Many worldlinges be wilful.
It is a vain thing to molest the mind with fortunes Inconstancy.
MUse not a whit, though Fortune frown,
And turn thy joy unto dispight:
She sets up, she pulls down,
She moves care, she brings delight.
Thus to and fro
this Dame does toss,
To overthrow
Our wealth to loss.
From wealth to loss, is cause of grief,
And cause of grief, procures pain:
And pain is that would have relief,
And where relief, does still refrain.
What think you tho,
Some sigh and say:
Oh fie on woe,
And woeful stay.
And woeful stay, that only is,
The wretched wringer of the wit:
The thing that life would feign Dismiss,
If Jove would so allow of it.
Where Reason fails,
And Will is Judge:
What then Preuailes,
But Wrath and Grudge.
But wrath and grudge? what life is that,
Who would Desire there to be?
The silly Mouse does drea^ the Cat,
Because she fears her Cruelty:
Even so annoyes
Which daily grow:
^ereaues the joys
Of some I know.
Of some I know, that daily taste
The sower sauce of sorrows still:
And yet with grief they take repast.
And make a mirth of every ill.
For that's the way,
As wisdom shows:
For to alay
Dame Fortunes blows.
Dame Fortunes blows which co^pled are
With ouerthwartes that glutte the mind^:
And in the stomach make such war,
As life does wish it were Resigned.
Yet only this
Remembering still:
A tune there is
To end all ill.
He being very sick, and finding great courtesy at his betters hands,
thereupon writ^th.
LEt truth Report, what Trial finds,
Conceal no praise where it is due:
^e bold to laud such courteous minds,
As that disdain not for to view,
As well the simple as the best,
With sickness when they be oppressed.
Not like the Proud Ambitious wights
Which scorn the simple for their race:
Where wisdom guides, there are no sight^,
For modesty supplies the place,
And pity pricks their ruthful eyes,
To pity him in cares that lies.
And Doubtless sure for their reward,
High Jove some heavenly hap will send:
Besides, their Fame, which is Preferred
Throughout the soil where life does lend.
And for my part while life does well,
I will not let the same to tell.
As knows God
Which sits on hye:
Who every secret thought
Does spy.
If I dissemble
Or do feign,
God grant good hap
I near attain.
A Question unto true Meaning.
WHere have thou been so long,
True meaning to me tell?
Abroad in world to seek and search
where Faithfulness does dwell.
What have thou found him out,
and where he keeps his hold?
I, (...) keeps a marrish place,
that is both moist and cold.
Who brings him his food?
firm friends which never fail:
And what is that they bring to him?
Plain proof, which shall prevail.
Why does he keep away?
because men should him crave:
He says that few now Desire
his company to have.
Who is the cause thereof?
Dissembling deep delight:
Who does allure the minds of men
to swerue from faithful right.
And does Dissembling drive
Firm faithfulness away?
I. I. Truemeaning marks it well,
he sees it every day.
Let Flearing flattery faune,
Truemeaning is but plain:
Yet Truemeaning and faithfulness.
were never found to feign.
Truemeaning cannot gloss,
ne Faithfulness deceive:
Wherefore Truemeaning and Faythfulnesse
of Dissembling take their leave.
Written unto Master S. H.
IF wealth agre'd unto my willing mind.
To gratify you as I do Desire:
Then trust me true some present you should find
For recompense, but this I you require,
For to accept these verses here in place,
Which simple be, and worthles in their grace.
I cannot choose exaction moving me,
But write I must, yet briefly I intend:
I am Disposed (belike) that you should see
A few verses which I do commend
To your constructio^, uprightly for to Deem:
Then courteously see that you them esteem^.
It were a fault to flatter with a friend.
A fault, nay sure a villainy, that's more:
Where Trusty troth abids not to the end,
Nor promise kept, as it was made before.
If breach thereof be proved, then I say,
Such well deserve to be put from the way.
Where faithful friendship walks void of guile
And firmenes fixed, fond flattery to reject:
And Deep disse^bling, with her glosing style
Is put apart, where Trust does whole protect.
Which Trust God grant until our days do end.
Trusty to be, unto a faithful friend.
No foe to a flatterer.
A fancy upon fortune
Since Fortune does assign,
My joys they shall untwine,
And cares they shall combine,
I must contented stand:
Since that she is my foe,
Good luck to overthrow,
And hapless hap to show,
I take it at her hand.
I take it at her hand,
Perforce then I must stand,
For to abide her band,
Until she me release:
Her subject and her thralle,
Her vassaile at her call,
Her innocent and all,
So must I hold my peace.
Though wrong I do sustain,
Alas it is in vain
For me for to complain,
When Fortune knittes her face^
But bear it well in heart,
Although it be a smart,
In faith without Desarte,
More greeuouse is my case.
But God that sittes on hy,
And guydes the cloudy sky,
And does each secret spy,
Respect this ruthful tale.
Remember those in care,
Whose back is feign to bare,
Until their eyes do stare,
And yet they not avail.
How long will Fortune frette,
How long shall I thus set,
How long shall sorrows get,
For to bereave my joy?
How long shall pleasure stay,
How long shall mirth delay,
How long shall I thus sway,
In depth of mine annoy?
Will Fortune never smile,
Will Fortune wrong compile,
Will Fortune still exile?
O now I hope and trust,
That fortune will me pleasure,
Though not with wit or treasure,
But quiet life and leisure,
Lo thus I hope and must.
A vow prefixed.
AS Tracte of Time, does try each trade,
And Trial does disclose the truth,
And truth is seen where proof is made,
And proof explaineth joy or ruth:
So modest mind is bent to bear,
The mirth, the moon, the woe and care,
The mirth we easily can uphold,
The more indifferently to taste:
The woe is neither hot nor cold,
The cares be as the cause is placed.
Lo one my friend, and three my foes,
My pensive pen does now disclose.
To take each chance and act upright,
To hears each speech that shall be told:
To laugh when cause is of delight,
To smyle when Fancy things behold.
Thus to behave and frame thy mind,
Shall make thee see when some are blind.
The silly soul that droyles in dirt,
And drinks the dregs of deep Disdain:
Whose simple mind does think no hurt,
By Patience does experience gain:
And closely does convey a smyle,
To cheer his mind, between each while.
Thus neither for to fear the brunte,
Nor yet to care for too much toil:
But patiently to take thy wunt,
Till Tracte of Time do give the foil.
And like as trees their Blossoms shed,
So cares be past when man is dead
Patience is profitable.
A quiet life is sure a world of wealth,
A mean to mirth, a preparatiue for health.
What Is that has chaung'd thy state, my friend to me (...)
What Is that has eased thy fear and toils of (...)
What Is that which makes thee now at liberty from c^^e?
Does pleasure now possess the place, which grief did (...)
No, it is a quiet life, which is the world of wealth,
A mean to move us unto mirth, a preparatiue to health.
For where Discention digges, there Sorrow sowes his so^des,
Where fearefullnesse is found, there (...)
Where soaking sighs be sonke: what (...)
I me report to those, which he with those extreemes wealth.
For sure a quiet life is even the world of (...)
A mean to move us unto mirth, a preparatiue to health.
The heart which haunted is, with daily (...)
Is in a prison pent in pain, (...):
And when their happens joy, it is deemed for Fortunes (...)
As often it is her property slyly to smyle and ^est.
But sure a quiet life is ^^en a world of wealth,
A mean to move us unto mirth, a preparatiue to health.
The shep^hearde poor and base, (...) his (...)
Is joyful for t^see, his number safe and well^
He eats with merry cheer, and i^yfully death (...)
He thinks that trade of life, does others far excel.
For sure a quiet life, is even the world of wealth,
A mean to move us unto mirth, a preparatiue to health^
What booteth Midas mucke, where Nero is at hand^
Whose pining trade does rear (...) ruthful rage,
Is there a quiet life, how might one vnderst and^?
No, no, it is a hateful hap until it does aswage.
But sure a quiet life, I count the world of wealth,
A mean to move us unto mirth, a preparatiue to health.
To live in quiet state, each Godly mind Desires,
To sue and serve the Lord his gifts of grace to gain:
To ask his heavenly help, it is most that some requires,
To way the worldly woes, is but a mean to pain.
Then sure a quiet life, I deem the world of wealth,
A mean^e to move us unto mirth, a preparatiue to health.
His farewell to Fear.
FArewell Fond Fear which did my mind dismay,
Whose peevish pangues procured my private pains:
The soaking sighs thou did in stomach lay,
Often cau^^d my mind to construe of disdain.
But sines I see that thou did me deceive,
Fond Fear farewell, of thee I take my leave.
I feared thee Fear, and why? because I hill'd
Thy fearful fittes as Master of my mind:
I stood in awe to do what so thou willed,
And was content to stoop unto thy kind.
But since I see that thou did me deceive,
Fond Fear farewell, of thee I take my leave.
Yet God forbid true fear I should exempte:
The fear of God before mine eyes to be,
If I neglect, I count it but contempt,
A graceless gift, from sin it were not free.
But when I saw Fond Fear did me deceive,
Fond Fear farewell, of thee I take my leave.
What lingering life led I with doubtful days,
What heavy happes by thee were brought to pass:
I feared thee Fear in hope to purchase praise,
But when I saw thy truth like tickle glass,
Then quoth I thus thou shall not me deceive,
Fond fear farewell, of thee I take my leave.
God grant to those, with whom Fond Fear will be,
A patient mind to suffer all their Illes:
That Hope may help, and Comfort let them see:
And Time may turn the world unto their wills.
But I say still, since Fear did me deceive,
Fond Fear farewell, of thee I take my leave.
Of the burning of the ears.
IF Talles so often told,
may move us to believe,
That truth of force in them does rest:
then let it not me grieve,
That I do credit give
unto the saying old:
Which is, when as the ears do burn,
some thing on thee is told.
Then trust me now for true,
in me it is approved:
For why, my ears have burnt so hot
as I thereby am moved,
To write as hear you see,
for to foreshew my case:
That unto fables fond and vain,
our nature gives place.
For if the right ear burn,
then thus the saying is:
No good on thee that time they speaks.
but sure how true it is,
I leave it for to judge,
to those that know the same:
For if I intermeddle far,
I shall but purchase blame.
Well, when the left ear burns,
then do they speak thee good:
But surely I count them both
a tale of Robinhood.
Believe them who that lift:
for I will leave the same,
To him which is the righteous Judge,
and Prince of peereles Fame.
A sorrowful Libell Exhibited to Jove.
OH mighty Jove, whose power is infinite,
Which can release each captive bound in thralle:
Uouchsafe O God, to hear me which lament,
And send redress to ease me of this galle.
Let me not thus in thraldom still be bound,
Since thou art he can ease me of my wound:
But send me help from heavenly throne above,
Where thou have store,
For grief much more,
If that thou please from me it to remove.
I do confess Oh God withal my heart,
I have deserved this grief, though it were more:
Yet I do hope thou will relea^e my smart,
And ease my thralle which greeueth me so sore.
Have mercy Lord, for all my sinful lore.
The Righteous man does often times transgress,
As still I do (O Lord) I do confess:
Yet this I hope, thou will not have respect
Unto my Sins
Which never linnes,
Nor holy Lord thy vassaile to reject.
Send liberty O Lord, when thou shall please
Unto me now a wretch all wrapped in woe,
And grant Good Lord unto me now some ease,
Oh hear me Lord, for now my grief is so,
As it is thou must make it from me go,
Or else my life will soon be laid in grave,
Which Dollour (she) would gladly so it have.
Yet Lord of help, let help extend a pace,
And grant relie^e
To ease my grief,
For Lord I rest in lamentable case.
I wish my death, a hundredth times a day
With faithful heart O Lord, as thou do know:
I wish, I wish that I were laid in clay,
Then thrall should cease, her seed in me to sow,
The wind of care should not upon me blow,
The galls of grief should cease in their despite,
If cl^ddy clay had gotten once her right,
And I should cease to make this my complainte
Which gre^ues me still,
And so it will
Until high Jove give judgment of restra^ite.
Mark wellmy woe, mark well my mourning tears,
Mark well O God my supplication here
Which I prefer for riddance of my fears
And turn my thrall unto some joyful cheer,
Else I do wish for to be laid on bear.
Let not Dame thrall ein thraldom so me blind,
But grant O God that I relief may find,
To ease me wretch which do make all this mo^e
In sollemne wise
With plaintes to skies
In every place, where as I go alone.
Wherefore Oh King ease me when thou think good,
I yield my self into thy heavenly hands,
I wish it God, for Christ thy Son his blood,
Who suffered pain us to redeem from bands:
So now good Lord ease me from thrall which stands,
Within my Corpse which breeds my decay,
And hourly does my ^^sing mind affray.
Have mercy Lord some pity on me take,
And grant redress
My thralles to less
O Lord I pray, for thy great mercyes sake.
The conclusion, wherein is included the Authors Name.
I pardon crave of sober modest minds.
And sorry am, if that I d^ offend:
My will is glad, (...) happily it finds
Indifferency, where judgment does extend,
Such censure as affection will permit.
Yelding thereto, if reason judge, and wit.
A willing heart is glad to gratify
Those, whose deserts deserve full will the same.
In whom consistes (as trial does it try)
Such worthy works as merits mickle fame.
Muse then no whitte at this my simple book,
A forde good words, as well as on it look.
Disdain it not, although it want the file,
Esteem it well, hereafter you shall see
More w^rldly works I mean for to compile:
Experience may bring knowledge unto me.
FINIS.
None good but God.
