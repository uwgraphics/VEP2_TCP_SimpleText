The huntyng and fyndyng out of the Romish fox which more then seven years
has been hyd among the bisshoppes of Englong after that the Kings Hyghnes had
commanded him to be driven out of his realm.

Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nestes / but the son of man has
not Where he may rest his head in.

Whosoever happens upon this book / if he love god beter then man / et the
Kings Hyghnes better then the bysshoppes falls hypocrisi / let him give it to
the King / that he may read it before the bysshopes condemn it.

M.D.XLIII.

To the most excellent prince King Henry the eight King of England France and
of Irland supreme gouerner in earth of these his realms willm Wraghton
Wisshethe health prosperity of both body and soul.
ALL thoghe sense the time thari was a child / i have been more brought up in
learning then in huntyng / and have therefore no great skill or experience in
huntyng / yet the love that i bear unto my natural country compels me at
this time (most excellent and uictorious Prince) to be a hunter / to hunt and
find out a certain cruel best / which both has don et does yet still mich
harm in your reaml and kyilleth both young and old all that he can cum by. This
best has lost his mame in england but never a Dele of his cruel conditiones.
This self best have ye ernestly gone about ^n Word Writing and Workyng as myche
as one man is able to do to drive out of your realm. But the hundes that ye
set to do this deed. Was and ar / of the same kind and lineage that the wild
best is of therefore they bark at him for a face but they bite not. They make a
praetence as they would worri him / and yet when he is in ieperdy of taking they
help to cover him with tame bestes skins / that the proverb may have a place
on dog will not eat of an other dogs flesh nether will o^ wolf eat of an
other. These hounds love this best so well that if they can catch any other
hou^d persewyng him which is / of an other kind then they be of / that is to
wit if he have not a payr of prik ears standing up / on before and an other
behind / they will never rest til they se the other hounds heart blood. they
te^dre this best so interly and would so fayn have him unknown / for fere that
your Hyghnes should kill him if he were known / that they bear all men in hand
that their is no such best in all your realm and ponyshe them with many kinds
of death that dare say that their is any such best in engloud. But if ye will
of your Kyngly liberalite grant me licens to call all that the pope has made /
ordened / and decreed / the popes traditiones ordinances and decrees / i shall
so hunt out this best et discover him that all your hole realm may spy him and
se him and know him what he is / what is his name / and where he lurketh This
once brought to pas it shall be more easy for your hyghnes to accomplish and
bring to pass your godly purpos / which is and ever has been senc ye knew his
conditiones / to drive this beast out of all places of your dominion. I desire
also your kyngly hyghnes that ye will not suffer this my doing to be condemned
of the bisshoppes / till your oun learned discretion have tried it and examined
it with the word of god and with the light of your reason and learning / and
then if my huntyng be found contrari to the word of god / so soun as ye find it
so / let my huntyng be forbidden / et not before i be seche you for the love of
the king of heaven which / save and keep you from all your enemies both bodily
and gostly Amen. From basil the first day of may. Anno domini 1543.

THe co^mun sort of foxes knowing that they cannot choose but be persewed for
their murder / that they daily do and intend to commit / have holes either in
the ground or in great rokkes where as they thynk they may bein sefegard / and
whereto they may fly for sukker when they that have the harm do^ unto them and
theyres do persew after them. But this fox that i follow after / and hunt / at
this time / as he is of an other kind of foxes the^ the common sort be / that
is to wit a romish fox and a man kyller / for fear that he should be dug out
of the grond if he hyd him self in the commu^ fox holes / now when certain scol
ares of Camhrygd and of Oxford even straight way after that he had killed
certain of their fellows / followed him to have catched him / ran with all the
speed that he might / in to the church / and when the scolares would have
followed him in to the church the bisshoppes and prestes bet them out again /
and so came the scolares bak again with blody pates / and durst no more seek the
fox in the church. For the bisshoppes and the clergi set up streght way on the
church door a letter where in it was contened that from thence forth no man
should seek the fox any more their and that no man should call that romish fox, a
fox but the kings best. And yet the bisshoppes had the advantage of the best
/ as a certain scoler had of a fox in Cambryge. The scolare had a rain fox in
his Chamber where as he made him a hole be hynd a holow be^che / the fox went
out on the nyhgt and brought to the scolares chamber hens / dukkes and capones
/ where with he and his fellows made often times good chere. And so do the
bisshoppes and prestes make myrre with it that this fox brings in to the
church But in as much as the king is a boue all the bisshoppes and i have axed
him leave to hunt the fox where so ever i thynk that i can find him / i will with
the kings leave hu^t this fox in the church for i gather by certain
co^iectures that he is their For as it is a good co^iectur if a man be in a wod
and se a great hole in the gro^de to thynk that their ha^uteth or has ha^uted
a fox / and if their be / by this hole many pieces of la^bes skynnes / many
lambs bones and geswynges and chekynges feathers, that at that praesent time
there is a fox hauntyng that hole / so i thynk that if i conjecture that their
is a romish fox in the church / i shall not conjecture amiss / for i saw when i
was in England in a certain church a great hole in the hie aultare which i
could not tell for what purpos the gentle men of the church have ordened it
except it be to hyde their father the fox in / when he is persewed after / and
by this hole i saw a great sort of lambs bones about the altar. I saw certain
prestes that were almost lade^ with lamb skins / and with tales and pieces of
other bestes skin^es also / I saw also myche gold and silver about the fox
hole. which thing made me meruel the les when i heared afterward that the
prestes so mantfully ma^teyned the fox Therefore i thynk uerely that the fox is
in that hole / and i dout not but that i shall either find him in the bisshoppes
miters or ellis in this hole or perchance in both. After that i have found out
this rauenyng and ma^killynge fox i trust (most victorios prince) that ye will
follow king Salomo^ in ponysshynh of him / king Solomon took Ioab a murderer the
capitane of of his fathers wars / from the altar and put him to death and
suffered not the sa^ctuari to save him. So i trust that if this fox be found
eue^ on the hye altar under the chalice in as myche as he is a murderer that
ye will not suffer him to have any sa^ctuari or place of refuge and sukker
their. But now let us begin this forsayde hunting.

Hoo ye lordly byschoppes and ye Clean fyngred gentle men of the clergi is not
the fox of rome other wys called Papa among you? if ye say that their is non
such among you / where is the fox the pope which had wont to be among you / ye
cannot deny but that he was once among you / tell me where is he now? If ye say
that he is dryue^ out of England / i will not be leave you for i saw blood
lately of his sheddyng in London streets / I saw lately many pieces of skins
about the hie altar and in the quere / I here daily both men and wymen
co^planyng that by this bestis means their children and friends ar put to
death wherefore i reken for all your saying / that he is not driven out of the
realm / but that ye have Deceived the King which commanded you to drive / him
out of the realm / and that ye have changed and scraped out his name and so
keep him still. If ye thynk that this be not true / tell me what was that foxes
name in English that ye banisshed / was it the Pope? ye cannot deni but he that
ye should have bannisshed was called the pope. If i find not that same pope
still among you / that the King commanded you to bannishe out of England i
shall give you leave to call me the falsest man that ever spak with tongue. Frist
to begin with all what was the pop that the king commanded vow to drive out of
England? whether was it the Popes person / or the Popes purse that had wout to
receive our money in england / or it was the Popis doctrine which beside all
other deuelishe decrees holds the falsely usurped pour over all Kings and
kygndomes? If ye say that the pope which the King commanded you to drive out
of England was the popes person / his flesh blood and bones / depositis mitris
mi lords ye lie. For what neded the King to set men to drive that man's
person out of his realm that never Came in it? If ye say that the Pope that the
King commanded you to drive out of England was the Popes purse alon / I thynk
that ye have so bannisshed the pope as certain vndersheriues and baliues. take
thieves and cast the^ in prison. Which if they catch a sely pore thief that
has but stolen an old nag not worth xix. pence cast him in prison and lade
him with yrones and make him be hanged. But if they take a lusty thief and
lykly to bring them mo prays / with a budget or ij and with a good purse /
they take his purse away from him and his budgettes and send him forth to stele
again and do him no more harm but that they take his purs from him / And if any
men say to them where is the tall fellow that ye tok yisterday / they auswerwe
took him but of suspicion / he is such a lords servant and there fore we durst
hold him no louger / Have ye not after this manner driven away the pope? tell
me i pray you. If ye say that the popes purse was the pope that the king
commanded vow to drive out of England / or his name alone / ye sklandre the
King and make him be euel spoken of in all other realms / And if ye say these
words / the pope that the king commanded us to preach against and to drive
out of England is nothing ellis but his name alone and his bottumles beggyng
bags / all they that have red the kings acts will say tyat ye be false
liers. Then the pope that the king commanded you to drive out of England / was
not the popis person which never came in to England / nether his name a lone /
nether his purse alon / and the king commanded the pope to be dryue^ out of
England / whether was it the popes doctrine and learning or no / that the king
commanded you to drive out of England? If it be not his learning what other
thing can it be? If ye say that it was not the popes learning and ordinances ye
run in danger of treason / for in sayng so / ye say that the king would not
have the popes falsely usurped pour bannisshede out of the realm / which a mong
all other deulysh doctrine and ordinances of the pope / is on pestilent popish
ordinance. Ye be uery loath to grant that the popes doctrine and traditiones
was the pope that the king commanded you to drive out of England Howbeit ye
must either grant that / or else say that the king commanded not at all the
pope to be driven out of England. For what other thing is their left to be the
pop that the king commanded you to drive out of England / saving his doctrine?
seeing it was not his person / nether his name alone / nether his purs alon.
Then must needs the Pope / that the King commanded you to drive out of
England be the Popes doctrine and traditiones. Ye need not to be ashamed to
call the popes doctrine the pope. For it is a received manner of spekyng in these
days among scolares and has been received of long time both of hethen and
holy writers / to call a man's doctrine or book by the name of hyme that made
it. If ye ax a scolare of Cambrydge what is red in the Philosophi schools he
will answer / Aristotel. If ye ax what is red in the humanite scoles he will
answer and say Terence / meaning by Aristotel and Terence the doctrine and books
which Aristotel and Terenc made. The profane writers have a proverb he has
not torn Aesop. whereby they mean not Aesopes body but his doctrine / and his
fables which he made / Abraham in the xvj. of luk says unto the rich
glotten concerning his brethern / they have Moses and the Prophets / and in
the i^ of the acts luke says that the gelded man / red Esai the prophet /
In which places Moses and the Prophets signifi the doctrine that Moses and the
Prophets taught. So then as Terences book is lau fulli called Terence as
Aristoteles doctrine is called Aristotel / and Moses doctrine is called Moses /
and the prophets doctrine is laufully called the Prophets / so ar the popes
traditiones et doctrine laufully called the Pope even that Pop that the King
commanded you to dryu out of his realm. Then have we gote^ of you at leynght
that the Pope that the King commanded you to drive out of his realm is the
Popes traditiones et doctrine / This once granted i reason thus. Whosoever ever
holdet still and manteneth the Popes doctrine and traditiones / holds still
et mantenethe the Pope / but ye bysshoppes hold still and mantene the popes
traditio^es and doctrine therefore ye hold still and mantene the Pope / If ye
deny that ye hold still the popes doctrine and traditiones / i will prove it
after this manner her after following.

1. Ye hold still the crepyng of the cross / the worshippyng of the image of
Christ called the crucifex. And the worschippyng of images is pope Gregory's
doctrine / as fasciculus temporum says in these words. Concilium generale fit
in urbe anno primo Gregorij tertij contra hereticos / in quo imaginum sanctorum
ueneratio approbatur and contradictores exco^municantur. Their was a consell in
Rome the first year of Gregori the third where in the worshippyng of saints
imagines was allowed / and the gayn sayers was excomunicated and cast out of
the church.

2. Yehold still coniuryng of water and salt to drive deuelles away to hele all
syknesses / and to be helht of both body and soul to all the^ that receyne
them. And this ordened Alexander the frist of that name.

3. Ye hold still hallowyng of chirches et of vestme^tes and that a pressed may
not say mes but in a hallowed Place with out a superaltare / and this ordened
felix the first Pope of that mane.

4. Ye hold still that a priest may receyne the sacrament of Christ's body et
blood for a layman and that the lay man's sins may be taken away by the
prestes receynyng for him and that the prestes receynyng may help the souls
departed and purches them forgyuenes also of sins / and that ordened
pellagius.

5 Ye hold still the receynyng of the sacrament for kye that have the longsoght
/ for horse that have the farci / for syk calves / for scabed schepe for meseld
swyne and for mad dogs / for ye hold in your helli misal vnput out and
vnpreacrhd against. Missam pro mortalitate animalium. A mes for death of
bestes and cattle / Then if the mess be the receynyng of Christ's body and
blood / then for dogs that are syke for syk calnes and rotten sheep / ye hold
still the receynyng of christ's body and blood that these bestes schuld not die
/ If to receyne the sacrament in the rnmembrance of scabbed schepe or messelled
swyne that Christ ordened to be received in the remembrance of his holy passion
/ be not Antichrists doctrine and there fore the popes say ye whose doctrines
is it and who put it in to your messal and why have ye not scraped that out as
well as the popes name.

6. Ye hold still that the mes or the receynyng of the sacrament is profitable
for a kybed or a mould hele / for the french pox / for the gout in the to /
and also for a winchester goose. for it is still in the missal vnput out and
vnpreched against / Missa Raphaelis Archangeli pro omnibus infirmitatibus / A
mes of Raphael the archangel / for all diseases / and siknesses then seeing
that this is not put out of your books ye hold it still / for the diseases a
boue rehearsed. If this be not amisusynge of the sacrament and the doctrine of
the pope say ye whose doctrine is this? for it is non of Christ's nether his a
postelles.

7. Ye hold still that by the mess or receyuyng of the sacrament that ye can
deliver damned souls out of hell and raise men from death to life. If ye thynk
that i lie / read wahe is written in Gregory's trentale / in your mes book
which ye say is better correct and has fewer fautes then the Bible / in these
words / Libera animam famuli tui de manibus daemonum. Deliver thy servants
soul from the hands of the deuelles / Iustorum anime in manu dei sunt. The
souls of ryhhtous men ar in the hands of god / and so ye go about to sing out
of the deuelles hands damned souls for non after this lift ar in the
deuelles hands but damned souls. It is also written in your dirgimes that ye
manteyn so ernestly with fire and faggot / and it is song in every dirge mes
aftyr the gospel / Somine Jesus Christ etc. Faccas domine transire de morte ad
vitam / Lord Jesus Christ make the souls to pasouer from death to life / These
ar de words of the mes / Now must life and death betoken either / salvation and
damnation / or ellis Death must signifi the tempolal death of the body and life
the life of the body. If that death and life be taken as they stand with out a
figure Then ye mean that ye can raise men from death to life / (o connyng
coniurers) If ye understand the words figuratly / then / ye mean that by the
mesye can deliver souls from their death which is damnation / to life that is
to their salvation. This sing ye in every dirgi mess / and either ye believe this
that ye sing or ye believe it not / If ye believe it not / ye do euel to make men
be slain for spekyg again it that ye believe not your selves / If ye believe it /
when ye make me anausuere / tell me whether is it the death of the body or of the
soul that ye desire God to deliver the saules from / and how many souls have
ye delivered from the hands of the deuel / and how many have ye raised from
death to life. If this doctrine be not Gregori the popes doctrine say ye whose is
it?

8. Ye hold still that the mixture and myngyng together of both the parts of
the sacrament may deserve forgiveness of sins and purches health of body and
soul / For ye say in your mes daily these words / Hec sacrosancta commixtio
corporis et sanguinis / domini nostri Ie su Christi / mihi omnibus que
sumentibus sit salus mentis et corporis ad promerenda^ uitam aeterna^ / That if
to say / this holy minglyng together of the body and blood of our lord Jesus
Christ / be unto me and to all them that receive it / hell the of body and
soul to deserve everlasting life. If this were not impossible / then neded no
priest nor bishop go to the deuel / thoghe they were never so great murderers
and hormo^gers. For anon after that they had don the mischefe they might
streyht way mix to gither both the parts of the sacrament and deserve theyrby
forgyuenes of yisternyghtes aduoutri and of this days murder. But for all thyr
myxyng and menglyng if they break the commandment of god / they must as well go
to the deuel as other / For god regards not on man more then an other / as
the Pope does / which says that all men that eat of that foresaid mixtur
shall deserve forgyuenes of sins and yet lik a partial fellow sufferethe this
mixture which is of both the kinds of the sacrament only to begyuen unto /
prestes / for he will let laymen have but the on half of it / He caret he
(belyk) not uery myche for layme^ that will not suffer them to cum by this mean
unto health of body and soul and to forgyuenes of sin / This is the doctrine
of Antichrist and if the pope be Antiwriste it is the popes doctrine.

9. Ye hold still the collates of the mes which pop Gelasius made.

01. Ye hold still the matines and hours and even song of the virgin Mari and
that the psalms which were made only in the honor of the creator / should be
song and said in the honor of a creature that is the uirgin Mary and this
ordenede pope Vrbane the second.

11. Ye hold still that from septuagesm to Ester that Aman may not praise god
in hebrew but in latin in the church / for ye forbid that alleluya should be
song that time / but laus tibi domine and this ordened pope Alexander the
second.

12. Ye hold still the secrets of the mess which ar open treson ahaynst god /
and this ordenede pope Gregori.

13. Ye hold still the canon of the mess / which ordened pope Gregori.

14. Ye mix water and wyn to gether still and that ordened pope Alexander.

15. Ye hold still this custom in poules that lay men may not cum in to the
quere at mes time for fere belike / that when the gluttens say / accipite and
comedite take ye and eat ye / they should take it that is offered them / and
this ordened pope Leo ths iiij. of that name. Now saying that their ar so namy
ordinances and traditiones of the pope in the mess / i report me unto you /
that he indifferent men / and beno bisshoppes sons / or no bisshoppes bondmen
/ by fyndyng of your chylder / wether i have just occasion to seek the fox in
the altar or no.

16. Ye hold still the mes in latin and sing al service and Christen and
assoyle in the old popes mother tongue and that ordened Ioa^n. Portue^sis.

17. Ye take the on half of the sacrament from all them that are no prestes and
that ordened the Pope and his guard / at constance.

18. Ye hold still the hallowyng of the font which is all full of abominable
blasphemes co^trari to the word of god and that ordened anthichrste

19. Ye hold still that a priest though he have the french pox or the ca^cre in
his mouth must spit in to a young childs monthe or ellis that he cannot be
baptized / or christened / the same.

20. Ye hold still the embryng daves which Vrbanus made assum writers hold /
and other write that it was Pop Calixtus.

21. Ye hold still lent and that made Telesphorus and Montanus the heretik
which first taught tha Marriage should be undone.

22. Ye hold still the fasting of the saturday and that made Innocentius the
first pope of that name.

23. Ie hold still that a pressed cannot make an unlawful vow / and that no
other man can make an vnaduisede vow after xxi. yer of his age and that no vow
made after xxi. may be broken save the vow of obedience and of wilful pouerti /
this made ye / and ye and the pope ar all on.

24. Ye hold still stews that the deuel may be worshipped their in and
condemn marriage of prestes with death / this also is the popes work

25. Ye forbid still all lay men to mary the hole half of the hole year save
ij wekes / and hold all the ministers of the church from marriage al their life
time / for ye will suffer no man to be a subdecon or a decon or a priest except
he forswear marriage first / and so ye compel men to (...) be votaries in as
miche as their must needs be ministers / and ye receive non except ye make then
forswear marriage / This was ordened by Gregori the seuent and by the counsel
holden at mence in germany.

26. Ye hold still that it is a greater offense for a priest or auotari to Mary
then if the prester should have defiled all the men's wives in his parish / or
the notari should have defloured all the uirgines in the citi where he
dwellethe. For that offense that ye thynk greater / ye ponyshe with a greater
ponishe meant / But ye ponyshe the marriage of these for said persons with death
at the frist / and hordom and aduoutre of the same but with lof of on part of
their goo des / at the first time and with an other part ar the second time
and the third time with the los of the remnant of the goods and with
perpetual prysonment. There for ye reken that it is lessyn for a pressed to ly
three times with his negh bores wife or for a votari to ly thryse with his
brothers doghter then to once Mary / Where as it was first inacted that the
hordome aduoutri and marriage of prestes and votaries should be ponisshed all
clike with death ye obteynet a moderation for the pronisshme^t of the hordo^ of
prestes decones and votaries / that they should not be slain if they were taken
in hordom or aduoutri / But ye let marriage of prestes stand still to be
ponisshed with death / and made no labor at all to obteyn any relese or
mitigation of the ponishment / for the marriage of votaries prestes and decones.
But that was not greatly to be meruelede at / seeing that ye never in tended to
mari as all they do that are lovers of hores cannot abyd that wives should be
given unto them. But if that ye had intended no more to be aduouterers and hoar
hunters / then ye purposed to be married prestes / ye would no more have soght a
relese for the ponyshment of wyueles horehuntyng prestes then ye souht a remedi
and a relese for the ponishment of chaste and mariede prestes But ye labored for
no relese at all for chaste mariede prestes / there fore ye never intended to be
such / But wanton wyueles and wanderyng bores / bukkes and bulls / or ellis
it follows tha ye in tended more to be aduouterers then to be married men / To
make the matter more clear i will put you an example. Their is in southfolk a
gentleman that has ij warre^nes / on of conies / and an other of hares / and
it is made feloni as well to steal hares as conies / there is a young man which
cummethe unto the auner of both the warrens and says unto him i know tha it
is feloni to stele a cony on the night / i pray you that if i be taken in
stelyng of a cony that ye will not take me as a felon but be content with the
third part of all my goods for the harm that i have don / The second time
that i am taken / let an other part of my goods satisfice for the faut / If i
be the third time taken / take all the rest of my goods for a mendes and put
me in perpetual prison. This young man knows that if he be taken in stelyng of
an hare in the night out of this gentle man's warren that he shall behanged /
and yet he desires no forgyuenes if he be taken in stelyng of an hare / Now
let in different men judge whether this man in tendethe more to stele hares or
conies. It is very lykly that he intends to stele conies and not hares. For
if he had as myche intended to stele hares as conies he would as well have axed
a reles for the ponishme^t dew for stelyng of hares as he axed a reles for the
ponishment of stelyng of conies. And so ye my lords god send ye grace / either
intended to be aduouteres or ellis knew that ye could not choose but fall in to
aduoutre / or ellis what neded you to seek a remedy a fore hand for a syknes
thas was to cum after ward that ye could avoid / if ye had not intended of a
set purpos to be siklye say that ye have all the gift of chastity there fore ye
need not to be aduouterers except ye will. The^ seeing that all ye that are
shaven in the crowns have the gift of chastity / and need not to be
aduouterers except ye list / and not with standing purches a relese a forha^de
for aduoutre / if follows that either ye will or intend to be aduouterers /
except ye say that ye have not the gift of chastity / or that ye cannot choose
but fall in to aduoutre / If ye have not the gift of castite and cannot choose
but be aduouterers with out matrimony / what abominable tyca^nes and deuelles
ar ye that co^ppelon an other to promis god it that ye know ye cannot perform?
The sum of it that is said is this. No wise mane sekethe a forehande a remedy
for him self for a death bryngyng diseas except he think that he can no avoid
or eschew the difease or inte^d to adventure to be sik in that deseas for the
obteyninge of sum thing that he louethe / Ye gentle men of the clergi / ye ar
wise men / Therefore ye seek no remedy a forhand for a death bryngyng diseas
except either ye know that ye cannot avoid it / or intend to adue^tur to be sik
in it for the obteynyng of sum thing that ye love. Aduoutre iiij. year ago if
that ye should have fallen in to it should have been unto you a death bryngyng
disease / Ande ye praeparede a remedy a for hand for it (scilicet togyue the
third part of your goods if ye had been taken with it) therefore ye either knew
that ye could not avoid the siknes of aduoutre / or intended to aduentuture to
be sik in the syknes of aduoutre for the obteynyng of your fleshly pleasure
which ye love better the^ honest matrimonial chastity. Answer to this reason
when ye have leisure. To be short ye have brought the matter so to pas that it
is death at the first forama^ to say that a pressed may mary and no death for a
pressed to commit and do aduoutre seven thou sand times / If this be not the
popes doctrine say ye whose it is / i kow that it is non of Christ's nether his
apostelles.

27. Ye holld still that their ar mo sauioures and bringers to heaven then
Christ alon for beside our oun works ye say that the merits of the virgin
Mari and of saint petronil / and of all saints may seue us and bring us to
heaven on saint mary's day ye sing sancte Marie merita perduca^t nos ad regna
celestia / The merits of saint mary bring us to the everlasting kynggo^ / And
on saint Petronilles day ye say in your mes / Per merita beatae Petronillae /
praesetis uitae subsidium / et futurae felicitatem concede / Grant us by the
merits or deservings of saint Petronil the help af this praesent life and the
felicite or happiness of the life for to cu^ / ye sing on all hallowes day.
Sanctorum meritis mereamur gaudia lucis / we pray god that we may win or
deserve the joys of lypht by the deseruyng of all saints / This doctrine is
of Antichrists making for it is contrari to the doctrine of Christ which
says i am the door / and noman cum meth unto the father but by me / The^ if
it be true that the pope is Antechrist this is the popish doctrine.

18. Ye hold still messes in the remembrance of saints / And that made Gregori
and felix.

Ye hold still uestmentes and copes / incens / and altares / organes and
discant in the church which pop Steven / pop Leo / and pope Vitilianus made /
ye hold infinite other ordinances mo of the popes making which it were to long
here to reherce / But if ye say that the popes have not made these ceremonies
and constitutiones / i will prove you liers by the autorite of all these.
writers whose names follow her after. Albertus magnus Blondus Beda / Baptista
Platina / Marcus Antonius Sabellicus / Raphael Volateranus / and Polydorus
Vergilius / All these say that popes have ordened these ordinannes and ceremonies
/ Now i thynk ye can not deny but that ye hold ordinances / constitutioces and
ceremonies which the pope has taght and made.

29. Ye hold still the canon law which is called in latin ius pontificium /
that is to say the Popes law / Ye hold still the Clementines the popes decres /
and his decretal epistelles / and by this canon law by these popish decretalles
and decres / all matters even unto this hour ar determined and judged in your
spiritual courts / by these laws men ar judged to be heretics and votaries
which ar non by the word of god / That these decrees and laws ar of the popes
making / let the most vnshamefaced of you deny it if he dare and let the best
learned of you prove the contrari if he can Then will i go forward with mi
argument / They that hold still the popes doctrine hold still the pope / ye
hold still the pope doctrine whils ye hold still his ordinances and his law /
Therefore ye hold still the pope / even that pope that the king commanded you to
preach against and to drive out of England. Now i repart me unto you that are
lords of the tempalti and to you burgesses of the parliament / whether i have
found out the fox in the church or no. If he be found out it is your deuti and
all their deutes / that love god and the king to follow after him to catch him
and to drive him out of this realm. But lest ye should go by him and know him
not from a tame best he is covered with these ij tame bestes skins sum time
with the law of the church / and other whiles with the kings ceremonies (for
so call the bisshoppes of England / the popes cano^ law, and the ceremonies
which the pope has made I beseech you noble me^ that have been brought up in
huntyng and ar no^ of the foxes fautores help at this time to catch this fox /
and i shall once let you have a sight of him and shall let you se how that they
that wear the same mark in their crowns that he wereth / do defend him and
hold him still in the church.

What say ye gentle men of the clargi / to this for said argument / Whosoever
holds still the popes doctrine holds still the pope. but ye hold still the
popes doctrine whils ye hold still the popes cano^ law the popes decretalles
and decrees and the ordinances above rehearsed that the pope made / Therefore ye
hold still the Pope. What answer ye to this Whosoever holds still the popes
doctrine holds still the pope? If ye grant this / what say ye to this / But
ye hold still the popes doctrine whils / ye hold still his canon law / and his
ordinances / If ye answer and say we hold not still the popes cano^ law / for we
say that the law thatt ye call the popes canon law / is the law of the church
/ and so we take it and use it / if ye say then that the canon law is the law
of the church (so did doctor glin call it in Cambridge) every man may well se
how that ye cover the fox with a tame bestes skin. Then when ye say that the
cannon law is the law of the church / answer of what chirch is the cannon law
/ the law of? Is it the law of the church of England? If ye say that it is the
law of the church of England / then this follows of your saying. The popes
church of Rome is governed with the ordinances above rehearsed / and the canon
law is the law of the Popes church / even at this hour then if the cano^ law
be the law of the church of England / the popis chirch and the English chirch
ar all on concerning their ceremonies and law / and then in what thing do they
differ? Then if the chirch of Rome be a popish / church because it is rueled
bithe popes canon / law and by his ordinances / then must the chirch of England
also be a popish church when as it is governed by the sam selflawe and
ordinances which make the chirch of Rome a popish church / But the Pope is
the head of every popish church / and by your sayng the chirch of England is
a popish church / therefore the Pope by your saying is the head of the church
of England.

Now seeing that these in conueniences follow of sayng that the canon law is the
law of the chirch of England / say no more that the cano^ law is the law of the
church of England / but of / the chirch of rome / for the law of Cristes
church, of which england is on part is the new testament and the old / that
is to wit the doctrine that the Prophets / the Apostelles and Christ taught
and not the canon lauw with the decrees and decretalles and the ordinances
which popes of Rome have made. But if doctor glin commissari of Cimbridge with
his other canonisticall canaanites will for all the inconveniences above
rehearsed hold still stiffly that the canon law with the decrees and decretalles
ar the law of the church of England / let them answer to a question or ij that
i will propound / whether was the chirch beforthe law of the church / or the
law of the church / before the church / if ye say that the chirch was before
the law of the church was / then was their a time when the church was lawles
/ But that is an vnco^uenient / therefore ye cannot say so / ye must their fore
fo say that either the law of the church was made be fore the church / or at
the first time that the church was. It folowethe then that when and whersoeuer
the most perfect church was / that their was the most perfect law of the
church. But in Christ's time and the Apostelles time and in the times of the
holy martyrs was the most perfect chirch / therefore then was the perfitest law
of the church / then the law of Christ's church / was in the Apostelles time
all ready made and so perfect that no man could make any thing more perfect / But
the canon law was not yet made in the apoststelles time / their for the canon
law was not the law of Christ's church in the time of the apostelles / The
word of god which is the law of the chirch lasts for ever and is not changed
/ so that the church of Crist at all times has no other law but Christ's
word. ye say that the canon law is the law of the church of England therefore
ye say that the chirch of England is non of Christ's church / in as myche as
ye say that the law of the chirch of england is an other law then was the law
of the church of Christ and the apostelles time which was the true Christen
church. But if ye masters co^munemissaries / will needs call still the canon
law the law of the church / what mean ye by the church? whether mean ye the
congregation of all them that archosen to be saved or no? if ye mean so ye lie
/ for many that are in heaven never knew the canon law / if ye mean by the
church the Prophets the Apostelles / and the Evangelists / ye lie for the
canon law was never of their making / if ye mean by the church the pop and
them that are sworn unto hyme / it is true that the cano^ law is the law of the
church. Will ye now comunemissaries that the law of the church that is of the
pope and his shauelynges shall beholden still in England? if ye will so the^ i
need to reason no more to prove that ye hold still the pope in England. If the
church signifi a another sort of men then i have made mention of / tell me in
your answer to these my questiones and tell me who made the canon law if the
popes of Rome have not made it. Then this solution will not serve / that the
canon law / is the law of the church / seeing that it cannot be the law of any
church but of a popish chirch for it is of the popes making. But if it were
granted that the canon law were the law of the church / yet ye can not deny but
the traditiones ordinances and ceremo^ies before rehearsed ar of the popes
making. Then this argument stands un solutede / whosoever holds still the
popes doctine holds still the pope / But ye hold still the popes doctrine /
ergo ye hold still the pope / If ye answer we tak them not as the popes
ceremonies and ordinances all thoghe we know that the pope has taught them
and made them but as the kings ceremonies and ordinances / for the king has
commanded in a certain proclamation that no man schuld from the time of that
proclamation be so hardy as to call the ceremonies and ordinances that were in
the church of England at that time / the popes ordinances and ceremonies but
the kings ceremonies and ordininances all though it were out of all dout that
the pope had mad them and taught them / But now ye gentle men of the clergi
which was the cause of this proclamation / answer me if it pleas you to a
question or ij. If Francis the king of France should make a proclamation that
all the noble acts and deeds of king Alexander the conqueror / and all the
acts of Sardanapali should be no more called and taken for Alexanders and
Sardanapali acts and deeds but for his deeds should all the acts and deeds of
Alexander and Sardanapali be therefore the king of Frances deeds and acts? i
thynk no. For if by proclamation men might make other men's deeds and acts
their oun acts / then might Sardanopalus have robbed Alexander of his noble
acts and made them his / and so a uery cowhert might have as many noble acts
as the best warrier in all the world. If the king of Portugale should command in
a proclamation that Aristotel and Platoes works should no mor be called
Aristoteles works and Platoes but his works / should Aristotel and Platoes
works by these means be cum his works? I thynk nay / for if the king of
Portugagal might take Aristotoles works from Aristotel then might Menius becu^
Maro and the most unlearned in a cu^tre might have as noble works as the best
leaned man in the world / If the king of denmark should set out a proclamation
that all the ceremonies of Moses law as offering up of calves and frankincens
should no more be called and taken for Moses ceremonies but for his should not
Moses ceremonies continue Moses ceremonies still for all the proclamation? I
think so. The^ is their no proclamation that can disposses the the pope of his
ceremonies and constitutiones but the ceremonies and ordinances which was his
xij year ago shall be his ceremonies and ordinances still thoge a thousand
proclamationes should command the co^trari / Ye must fyndde out an other hole to
hyde your father the fox in for here he can lurk no longer.

Neuertheless like faithful foxy childer ye have don the best that lay in you
to cover him. For about seven year ago when men preched ernestly against the
pope / and he with all his ordinances was like to bedryuen out of England / a
certain man to set him forward gathered together out of platina and such other
writers / what popes had made all the ceremo^ies that are now in the church /
and to every ceremoni he assygned on pope or other / which thing made the
ceremonies begin to be less regarded then they were before / Then ye feryng that
they should be dryue^ out of the realm with their father if they were taken for
the popes ordinances / by your friends ye procured and brought to pass / that
the ceremonies which the pope made should no more be called the popes
ceremonies / but the kings ceremonies. And this was set up and procla^ed in
every marketh town. In doing of which thing as myche as lay in you ye made the
king pope / for if the popes acts and the kings be all on / then is the king
the pope or ellis partner with the pope / Whether say ye makes the name of the
pope / the pope / or the popes acts and deeds. If ye say that the name of the
pope makes a pope then have ye many popes in England for their ar many that are
called popes in England which never the less hate the pope more then ye do /
The name of the Pope makes not the^ the pop / but the acts and deeds / of the
pope / As not every man that is accused of theft and called a thief / is a
thief / but he alon is a thief that does the acts and deeds of a thief / so
it is not the name of the pope that makes the pope but the popes acts and
deeds. Then it folowethe well / lykewys as he that lays and assygneth to a
true man the deeds and acts of a thief makes a true man as myche as lies in
him / a thief / so ye gyuyng and layng to the king the acts and deeds of the
pope / as myche as lay in you made the king the pope / Call ye their for no
more the popes canon law / the law of the chirch of England / call no more from
henceforward the popes ordinances the kings ordinances for fere of it that
follows. It is plain then that ye hold still the popes cano^ law and thoghe ye
have banisshed his name for a face / that ye hold still his books and his
ceremonies. Then answer me to a question / Ar their not many things in Johan
frithes books / that are both good and godly and agreyng with the word of god?
And then tell me why have ye condemned all his books for heresi and the reders
of them and hauers of them for heretykes for not mo then ij or three hereses
even after your judgment / seeing their ar so many other godly things that are
no heresi / If ye say thoghe there be many good things in his books what need
Christen men to sek our good things out of an heretics book / seeing their ar
books i now be side and therefore / we burn the heretics books wih the heretics
/ lest the heresi that the heretics taught should sprede by the means of the
books / for as the voice of an heretic heard makes heretics so the books of
an heretik red make heretics / and therefore we burn the on with the other /
answer me to this / the pope is both an heretik and a traytore as their is non
of you all that will deny / then how happens it that when ye ba^nisshed this
heretik / that ye burn not his books as well as other heretics books / I know
no other cause but that ye favored them for your fathers sake / Well then as the
books of a zuinglian heretic had and red make a zuinglian heretik / so the
books of a popish heretik / had and red / make a popish heretik / But allye
bisshoppes of england that are canonistes and all ye bysshoppes co^missaries
have andrede the books of a popish heretik that is to wit the canon law that
the heretik pope made / ergo my lords ye and your co^missaries ar all
heretics / As ye judge other me^ so shall ye be judged / Morouer as heretics
books ar the sede that heretics cum of / so popish books ar the sede that
papists cu^ of / Then he that will not burn heretics books but will ma^tein
the^ will that their shall be many heretics / even so they that will not burn
the popes books but will maintain the^ will that their shall be many papists /
ye do so / therefore ye would that their should be many papists / as it is the
most proper and peculiare werk of a perfect best to enge^dre a another like in
kind unto him self.

What do ye gentle men of the clergi ye have not yet soluted this argument / ye
hold still the popes doctrine ergo ye hold still the pope / even him that the
king would have driven out of england. If ye answer.

The popes doctrine that is contrari to the word of god is the pope that the
king would have driven out of england / but the ordinances above rehearsed are not
contrari to the word of god therefore we hold not still the pope that the king
would have driven out of england. To this answer / i say that the kings hyghnes
going about to deliver his subjects from the bondage of the pope and inten
dynge to drive out of his realm / abbottes priores nonnes monks and freris
which occupied the most part of his realm and proposed to set right Christen
men in their places / as por men's sons / to be afterward preachers of the
word of god / blind lame / and other pore Christen folk / intended such a
thing as all mighty god did when he delivered the chyldere of Israel from the
bondage of pharao / and drove out the chanaanites of their land that the true
Israelites might have that land and succeed them.

But allmyghty god gave this commandment unto moses the guyd and delyuerer of
the Israelites out of egypt / and all the childer of Israel thus / After the
coustom of the land of Egypt where as ye have duelt shall ye not do. And after
the manner of the land of chanaan in to the which i shall bring you / shall ye
not do / and in their most lawful ways shall ye not walk / ye shall do my
judgments / and my command mentes shall ye keep ia^ the lord your god / Do
not those things that they have don which was be fore you / seek in the xviij.
of Leuitici and these words shall ye find. So learned men whom the king
appointed to deliver his subjects from the bondage of the Romish Pharao the
pope / ought to have sweped the chirch and driven quite out of it all that ever
any pope had made / and if that Christ's church could not have been rueled and
ordered Christenly inoghe by the doctrine of Christ where with the primative
chirch was only governed then might you have gone abeggyng to your father the
pope otherwys called Antichriste desyryng him to let you have sum of his
ceremonies to govern Chistes church with all / which with out them were not
able to stand. The law of the gospel is a mor perfect law for the Christen then
the law of Moses was for the jews. But the jews neded no other law nor
ceremonies then the law of Moses / then the Christen men need no other law (as
touching their souls) but the law of the gospel. Therefore if the canon law and
the ceremonies above rehearsed were all at the deuel from whence they came the
chirch of Christ might be a great deal better governed then it is now governed
/ or ellis was the church in the apostelles times but euel governed / which
knew not on of these ceremonies that ye have in the chirch at this day.

Now have we showed you by the example of the scripture / that thoge the
ordinances of the pope had been lawful / that ye ought not to have holden them.
Howbeit i shall prove the popes ordinances which ye hold still / ar as myche
co^trari to the scripture as is light to darkness and Christ to Beliall / let us
therefore examine the chief and most laudable ceremonies as ye take them / with ye
touch stone of the word of god. / Is the crepyng of the cross agreyng with the
word of god? whatsoever ye say / i say nay / and thus will i prove it. In
crepyng of the cross ye worship the cross but the worshypping of the cross is
co^trari to the vord of god there for the crepyng if the cross is co^trari to the
word of god. If ye say that in crepyng of the cross that ye worship not the cross
/ i shall prove you falls liars not only by the autorite of the scripture / but
also by your oun words that i have written and by your oun confession. To
worship / as i will prove it by the autorite of the word of god / is to bow to
any thing. to fall down before any thing / to kuele / or with reverent
behavior to kys any thing / for so betokens the latin word adoro / and the
grek word (...) which word signifies to kiss / Here Regum 3. cap. 19.
Derelinquam mihi septem milia virorum in Israel quorum genua no^ sunt incuruata
ante Baal and omne os quod non adorauerit eum osculans manum. I will leave unto
me seven thousand men in Israel whose knees have not ben bowed before baal / and
every mouth which has not worshipped him kissyng his hand. ye may se that to
knele or to bow be fore an image or a^ idol is to worship it / and that
lykewis that to kys a^ image or an idol is to worship it for here the
scripture shows the manner of worshippyng / whereby we may know who worshippeth
and who worshippeth not / If ye require more scripture / to prove that to fall
down and to bow before a thing / is to worship it / here what is written in the
x. chapter of the acts of the appostelles / when saint Peter came unto
Corneliu^ Cornelius as soun as he saw him Procidens ad pedes adorauit eum /
falling down at his fete worshipped him. It is also write in the 22. chapter of
the revelation of Johan. how that the angel would not suffer Johan worship him /
in these words / And after that i had heard and seen / i fell down before the
fete of the angel to worship him which showed me these things / And he said
unto me / se that thou do not so / for i am thy fellow servant etc. worship god.
Now may ye evidently perceive that bythes places of scripture that to kys an
image reverently / to bow to an image or before an image or to knele to it or
to any such thing is to worship it. But ye knel to the cross and before the
cross / ye bow to the cross and kis the cross / therefore ye worship the cross in
crepyng the cross as ye call it / But sum of you peradventure / possessed with
the spirit of the deuel / which fyndeth out ever excuses and defense for his
service idolatri / will answer to me / as the hethen answered the old Christen
men / when they blamed them for worshippyng of gold and silver / that ye
worship not the image of the crucifix but Christ him self that the image
representithe / To this excuse i make this resone. To kis the cross it self is
to worship the cross it self but ye kyss the cross it self / ergo ye worship the
cross it self. But if this reason be not strong inoghe / i shall prove with an
other place of the scripture beside the iij. above rehearsed that / to worship
before anythyng is to worship the same.

It is written luk the iiij. that the deuel said unto Christ.

All these things shall be thine / if thou falling down will worship before me
/ And Matthew tellyng the same history say eth i will give the all these things
if thou will worship me / Then if luke and Matthew write all on sense and
differ not in rehersyng of the histori then is it all on thing to worship before
a thing and to worship a thing. The grek word that is turned in to english
before is more plain then the e^glish is for (...) beside before / betokens
in a man's sight or before ones face / well ye worship before the cross / ergo
ye worship the cross. Moreover if that worshippyng before an image / be not the
worshippyng of an image / whi have ye commanded that noman shall set any candel
before any image save only before the crucifix / when as the people might answer
to the^ that accused the^ for worshippyng of images / when they set ca^delles
before images and kneled before images / we worship not the images we set
candelles in the honor of the saints that the images do repraesent and not in
the honor of the images / If this excuse be not allowable / then is not your
excuse alowable when ye say we worship be fore the cross but not the cross. Ye
hold still that the saints in heaven ar to be worshipped / but ye hold that no
images may be worshipped saving the image of christ crucified / which comunly
is either of gold or else of silver and gilded with gold / What a dryuyng away
of idolatri is this to forbid the worshippyng of images of tree and stone and to
compel men in pain of death to worship images of silver and of gold? As though
the scripture allowed golden images and silver images to be worshipped / Nay the
scripture reproves even the golden images in these words The images of the
hethen ar gold and silver the works of me^nes hands all they that make the^ /
be lyk the^ and all they that trust in the^. I have proved now by sufficient
witnesses of the scripture / that to worship before an image is to worship it.
ye worship before the image of the crucifix ergo ye worship the image of the
crucifix / If ye deny still that ye worship the cross or the image of the
crucifix / i will prove you liers by your oune words which ye have both said
/ and intend to say again / Tell me what do ye sing and say on good friday when
ye crepe the cross and the people crepyth after you? Sing ye not / Crucem tuam
adoramus domine lord we worship thy cross. And that all falls excuses should be
holden out / that ye say not / that by the cross ye mean the passion of Christ
/ it is written in your ordinari rubrike / Deportetur crux per medium chori a
duobus sacerdotibus vbi a populo adoretur. Let the cross be born through the
quere by ij prestes / that their it may be worshipped of the people / Can ij
prestes cari the passion of Christ in their hands / i trow nay. Seek thensum
other shift for this will not serve. Bethys time ye cannot deni but that ye
both worship images and compel other me^ to worship them also which thing i
shall evidently prove that it is as contrari to the scripture as antichrist is
to Christ. And thus will i prove it. If it be not lawful to make an image and
to have an image / it is not lawful to worship an image bad an made. But the
scriptur forbyddeth to make images and to have images then miche more it
forbyddeth to worship them / Here the places of the scripture which forbid the
making and having of images Exodus xx. Thou shall make the no graven image etc.
Leuinci xxvj. I am your lord god. ye shall not make you a similitude of a god /
or a graven image / Deuteronomij iiij. ye have seen no likeness in that day that
the lord spak unto you in oreb from the mids of the fire / lest ye perchanse
deceived should make unto you a graven liknes / or the image of a man or a woman
or the lyknes of bestes of the earth etc. Deuteronomii xxvij. Cursed be the man
that makes a graven or a casten image / the abomination of the lord / The wis
man in the xiij. chapter curses both the image and the image maker / If this
be the scripture and the word of god that i have rehearsed / then must ye needs
grant that it is not lawful to make an image / or at lest that it is unlawful
to make an image / and after that at is made to worship it / If that ye grant
either of these ij as ye must needs do / that it is forbidden by gods holy
word either to make images or to worship images that are made / ye cannot de ni
but that ye be damnable doctores / and ernest servants to the deuel / which
both worship images your selves as ye testifi in your service / and compel
the pore people against their consciences to worship images and commit idolatri
for your pleasure. / If ye say the scriptures before rehearsed forbid to make
the images of falls gods as of Iuppiter and of Mercuri and such other / and
to worship them / but they forbid not to make the image of Christ and to
worship it. This sayng is as falls as god is treu for god sayet deu. v. in the
second commandment / Thou shall make the no graven image nether the lykenes of
anythynges which ar in heaven above and which ar in the earth benethe / and
which are in the waters under the earth thou shall nether bow to them nor worship
them / Now tell me whether Christ is in heaven or no / if he be in heaven / as
ye cannot deny but he is the^ it is forbydde^ by the scripture to make any
lykenes of him and to worship it and to bow to it for the word of god sayetht
thou shall make the no liknes of anythyng that is in heaven above nether shall
thou worship it nor bow to it. But ye make the image of Christ which is in
heaven / and bow to it and worship it therefore ye do openly contrari to the open
word of god / Therefore either co^demn and scrape out the second co^mandmend / or
ellis leave of the crepyng of the cross and the worshippyng of the crucifix in
bow into it and in knelyng to it. For the crepyng of the cross and the second
co^mandme^t of god can no longer agree to gether.

But i will conclude this matter with an argument not easi to assoyle / If it be
unlaw full to fall down to worship the better and worthier thing / it is myche
more unlawful to bow to fall down to worship the wors thing and the vnworthyer
/ thing. Saint Peter saint Paul the a^gel that showed Johan his revelation ar
better and mor worthy the^ the image of the crucifix that ye call the cross But
if they we here all to gither it were not lawful to worship them Actorum x. and
xiiij. Apocalyp. xxij. ergo much mor is it unlawful to bow to fall down to
worship the image of the crucifix / And yet ye say that ye hold no popish
ordinances contrari to the word of god.

Is the coniuryng of salt and water to drive deuelles a way / and to hele all
syknesses / and to take away sins agreyng with the word of god? ye will
answer me in e^glish that ye make not your hally watter for any such intent
but only to be a remembrance of Christ's blood / but on sunday ye will answer
me in latin that ye make it to drive away deuellis / to hele all syknesses and
to purches forgyuenes of sins. Your answer is prynted and it is said every
sunday in every parish church of england / in these words / Immensam tuam
clementiam omnipotens aeterne deus humiliter imploramus etc. All mighty
everlasting god / we hu^bely beseech the that thou would witsafe with thy holinis
/ to bliss and make holy / this thy creature of salt / which thou have given
to the use and profit of man kind / that it may be to all them that receive /
it health of both body and soul / And the cherm that ye say over the water
every sunday is this O creatur of water i conjure the in the name of allmyghty
god the father and in the name of Jesus Christ his son / that thou may be
coniured water to cast out deuelles and to put away syknesses. etc. If ye say
not these words as often as ye make hally water / let me be hanged drawn and
quateredras a traitor to all mighty god and to my eue^ christen. How happens
this ye gentle me^ of the clergi that ye say on thing in latin and an other in
enhlishe? If any man speak against this yowr witched water / ye defend it in
the pulpit and say that ye make it to be a remembrance only of christ's blood /
and not to drive deuelles away and to be health of both body and soul / and on
the sunday next following ye say in latin that the people should not perceive your
cloked lying that ye make it to drive deuelles a way and to be health of both
the body and the soul / Ye crafety canonistes / ye play with hally water / pope
Alexanders daughter / as a certain canonist age^tle man of the church did with
an hoar of his. He occupied his hoar very long and sum began to spy her / He
them willing to hold his hoar still / cut her hare and made her a scolares
short go^w and so he went up and down in the town with her and noman suspect
her / never the lesshe was a very hoar and her patron lay with her every night.
So did ye long abuse this foresaid popes daughter / but as soun as your
fornication was spoken against in the pulpit / ye changed her apparel and put
on her the signification of christ's blood / on the day / that is to wit when
learned me^ was by you and her / and spoke against you / and on the night when
learned men were away / in the praesence of a few blind old wives ye abused her
as ye had wont to do. O duble aduouterous generation / both in the body and in
the soul / Now let us examine. your gentle woman and play the proctores of
cambrydge. till we have serched her out what she is. No man axeth any thing of
god but it that he believes possible and may well be / ye ax of god that salt
may be unto you and to all them that receive it salvation of body and soul /
ergo ye believe that it is possible and may well be / that salt may be salvation
to all the^ that receive it / But salt is an other thing besyd christ and ye
believe that men may be saved by it / ergo ye believe that their is or may be an
other savior or salvation beside christ / I will not suffer you lightly to
slip a way from with out an answer ye say to god allmyghty / grant us that
this salt may be salvation or health of body and soul to all them that receive
it.

Believe ye that it that ye ar is possible or impossible / If it be impossible /
ye be wise prayers / If ye believe that it is possible that ye ax / then believe
ye that it is possible that salt may be salvation of both body and soul / But
seeing that their ar no mo parts of a man but his bodies and his soul / and
christ can do no more to aman but to hele both body and soul / and ye say
that it is possible that salt may hele both body and so l. then it follows
that ye believe that your coniured salt may do as miche as christ.

And if this be not an heresy / to say that it is possible that salt may do as
myche as our redemer and savior JESUS CHRIST both god and man can do / what is
heresi? Now at lenghe thanks be un to god we have found out the right
heretics. let them that have autorite to ponishe heretics / look upon them
that hold this damnable opinion.

Tell me ye bald shaven sheep / which have the popes mark in your crounes / how
happens it that ye be weary of christ's salvation that ye pray the father of
heaven to make you another savior of salt / Has christ at any time disapoynted
any of you or any other man that trusted in him / that ye desire the father to
make an other savior of salt?

If he be a sufficient sauiure alon and disapoynted at no time the^ that trust
in him / what nedeye desire the father that salt may be health of boly and
soul? let them that under stand latin cum the next sunday to the church when
the pressed makes hally water and they shall besur to hear the pressed desyrnge
the heavenly father that salt may be salvation and health of both body and soul
to all the^ that / receive it / But lest ye should escape i will prove you open
idolaters by this your prayer To whom soever ye give the properti of god / the
same ye make god / as the chylder of Israel made a godd of the golden calfe
when they said that it brought them out of egypt / for non but god could.
deliver them through the read se from Pharao and the aegyptianes / and so they
gave to the calf that was dew to god. But ye give the property of god unto salt
ergo ye make a god of salt / I prove thus that ye give the property of god unto
salt / The peculiar and alonly property of god is to be health of both body and
soul / and that give ye unto salt / ergo ye make a god of salt / then ar ye
damnable idolaters. If ye excuse your coniuryng of the deuel out of salt /
water / fire / and wylow boues / and say we are the successors of the apostelles
/ nay their apes / the apostelles kest out deuelles why may we not also cast
out deuelles as the apostelles did? I answer with this question / The
apostelles anointed syk me^ and prayed over the^ and they restored the^ unto
their health again. How happenethe that among a thousand that ye anoynte / that
ye restore not on to his heltht again? It is to be thought that / the deuel
sets as much by your coniuryng of him away / as he set by the coniuryng of
the seven sons of the hye priest sceua / which was coniures / read what luke
writes of them Act. 19. chapter But certain of the run negate jews that were
coniures / tok in hand to call upon the name of the lord IESV over them that
had euel spretes sayng. We conjure you by JESUS that Paul preaches. for they
that did that were seven sons of sceua the hye priest. But the euel spret
answered / and said i know Jesus and Paul also / but who be you? And the man
that had the euel spret russhed upon them / and ouercam them and had the hyer
hand over them / so that they fled away out of the hows naked and wounded /
Belyke the deuel sets as myche by your coniuryng which ar the seven sons
of the hye priest of this time the pope / that is to wit cardinals
archebisshoppes / bisshoppes / prestes / monks freris and chanones / as he set
by the coniuryng of the seven sons of sceua the hye priest of the jews for i
never heard tell that these thousand years that ye keste on deuel out of any
thing that ye coniured yet / It is like also that the deuel having the hyer
hand over you / pulls the hear of your crouues as many as ar coniures and ar
the hy pressed the popes sons / as he rent the clothes of the other hye prestes
childer and wounded them well by this mark may we be suer to know a coniurer
and on of the popes sons that has vnlukely foughten with the deuel. To make
an end of this matter ye say to salt sis salus mentis and corporis be thou health
of body and soul and the scripture says of Christ / necest in alio quoqua^
salus their is health in no other / Now can ye nor say but that ye hold mo
popish traditiones contrari to the word of god then on.

Is the taking away of the on half of christ's supper from the lay men agreing
with the word of god? i thynk it is not. For theft and sacrilege is contrari to
the word of god / And the taking away of the on half of the supper from the
lay people is theft and sacrilege / therefore the taking a way of the on half of
Christ's supper from the lay people is contrari to the word of god. Thus prove i
that the taking away of the half of christ's supper is theft and sacrilege /
Theft is the taking away of it that belongethe to an other / against the auners
will / Sacrilege is the taking a way of an holy thing from them that it is dew
to / against their wills. But ye take from the lay people against their wills
/ the half of the sacrament which is dew unto them / Therefore ye commit theft
and sacrilege. If ye deny that the half of the supper that ye tak from them is
dew unto the^ / by what autorite claym ye the hole supper that is both the
parts of the sacrament If ye say by the autorite of the scripture which
says / take and eat this is my body / and drynk you all of this / was this
spoken and commanded to you and the apostelles a lone / or it was spoken and
commanded unto all christen men If ye say that it was said and commanded to you
alon / and to the apostelles the^ do ye the lay me^ great wrong which compel
the lay men in pain of death to receive the half of the sacrament / which were
not commanded of christ to receive it / If that these words take and eat / and
drynk ye all of a this cup / were as well said unto lay men as to prestes then
tayk ye away from the lay men against their wills / it that is dew unto them /

But to do so is to play the thieves and chirch robbers / their for to take away
from the lay people the on half of Christ's supper is theft and chirch robberi.
But theft and chirch robry is contrari to the word of god therefore it is
contrari to the word of god to take the on half of the sacrament from the lay
people / If this reason be not strong inoghe here an other / Whosoever ever puts
any thing to the ordinance and commandment of god or takes anythyng from it /
synneth dedly / Deuteronomi iiij. Ye shall put nothing to the word that i speak
unto you / nether shall ye take any thing from it. If it be dedly syn to
reprove and disanul a man's testament that is once approved / or to take any
thing from it / myche mor is it dedly syn to take any thing away from the
testament of Jesus christ which the father of heaven has allowed. Galat. iij.
But ye taking away from the lay people bibite ex ho comnes drynk ye all of this
/ that is the sacrament of christ's blood / take sum thing from the word of god
/ and ma^gle and minishe the last will of our savior Jesus christ / and scrape
out apart of chirstes will which was that al me^ should drynk of his blyssed cup
/ therefore in taking of the sacrament of christ's blood from the lay people ye
syn dedly. If a man had ij sons a priest and a layman / the priest is with
his father at the making of his testament / and the layman is away / the father
departs and commands both the lay man and the priest / to do on thing and
to receive on thing / the testament is allowed / now whether does the pressed the
lay man wrong or no if he will not let him receive the hole thing that his
father willed him to receive or no? Ye se by this similitude that seeing that ye
prestes ar our brethern / and not masters above us and ar all elyk bound to
keep christ's hole will / that ye have no autorite to defraude us and tayk from
us that our savior christ has commanded us to receive / and would that we
should take. Is it agreing with the word of god that a pressed may say mes and
receive the sacrament for a lay man and to teach that the prestes receyuyng of
the sacrament deserves forgyuenes of synes or at lest is profitable for lay
men and for the souls departed? I thynk nay. Have ye any text in all the hole
scripture whereby ye ca^ prove that a lay man may not as well receive the
sacrament for a pressed as the priest may receive it for a layma^ / If ye have
any lay it out / If on lay man can not receve the sacrament for an other lay
man and the yr by. win him forgyuenes of sins / a priest ca^ not receive the
sacrament for a lay man and theyrby deserve him forgyuenes of sins.

For as on christian man cannot be christened for an other / on cannot be
confirmed for another / on cannot be confessed for an other on can not repent
for an other / on can not take orders for an other / on cannot be anointed for
an other / on ca^ not be married for an other / so cannot a christen man receive
the sacrament of christ's body and blood for another / then if the priest be a
christen man he cannot receive the sacrament for a lay man. If alay man labored
sore from xij of the clok to six / and at six of the clok his supper were ready /
iax if the lay man were sore hungre and thursty / if the parish pressed should eat
the laymannes supper from him and drink up all his drynk from him wheter should
this prestes eating and drynkyng quench the lay man's hungre and thurst or no
/ prove that list / i thynk nay. So if the lay man have a great hungre and a
thurst to be conforted and streyntghened in his faith by the receyuyng of the
sacrament / shall the prestes receyuyng of the sacrament comfort the laymannes
soul and certifi his conscience that his sins ar forgyuen by the blood of
christ / I trow nay / or ellis but a little / If that the prestes receyuyng of
the sacrament comfort men's consciences more then if the laymen should receive
it their selves / what need sik me^ that are like to dye to have the sacrament
brough unto them when as the prestes receyuyng of the sacrament / in the
church comfort as well the lay man's soul after your opinion / and calls
to his remembrance the passion of christ / so well as thoghe the lay man had
received it in his house his oun self? Ye hold that the receyuyng of the
sacrament of pressed helps more the laymen both deed and quik then their oun
receyuyng let us ^ri thy which examples / reason / and scripture. As all mighty
god ordened the pasouer of the jews and the eating of their caster lamb / for
a remembrance of the yr deliverance from the scourgyng angel / and from the
bondage of Pharao / so christ the son of god both god and man ordened his
supper to be received of all christen men that they should call to remembrance
the passion of christ and the sheddyng of his most precius blood which has
delivered our souls out of the bondage of the spiritual pharao the deuel. As
the prestes and the lay men of moses law were all elyk bound to keep the f^ste
of their pasouer / and to thank god for their delyuerance from the scourgyng
angel and from the bondage of Egypt / and the prestes could not by the law of
godgyue but the half of the lamb to the lay people / so among christen men the
lay menar as well bound to keep their easter and to call to remembrance the
death of christ / and to give thanks for their delyuerance from the deuel / as
the elders of the new testament ar / seeing that they have received like profit
of christ's death and passion / And so the elders ca^ not by the word of god
tayk the on half of the supper from the lay people. As god would not al we it
that in the old testament / a pressed should eat the ester lamb for a lay jew /
so will not god allow it in the new testament that an elder that ye call a
priest shall take the sacrament for alay man / As an C. ye are after that the
chylder of Israel was delivered from the scourgynge angel and from the bondage
of Egypt / a priest of the jews could not deserve the delyuerance of the
layme^ by earyng the ester la^b whice was delivered an C. year be fore / so the
elders of the new testament / cannot deserve the delyuerance of the laymen of
the new testament that is fore gyuenes of sins by their receyuyng of the
sacrament of christ's body and blood / seeing above xv. hu^derd year ago all the
lay me^ that be leave in christ was delivered from death the deuel and da^nacio^
/ as paull to the Heb. in the x. chapter does plainly testifi in these words /
with on ablation and nomo he made perfect for ever all the^ that are sanctified
and ordened to be saved The^ cannot the priest by the receyuyng of the supper
of christ deserve our forgyuenes of sins and our delyuerance saying that our
delyuerance is so long ago past and christ ordened not his supper to deserve
our delyuerance from the deuel / but to be a remembrance of our deliverance
from the deuel and to give god thanks for our redemption and delyuerance.

If that ye hold stiffly still that the prestes receyuyng of the sacrament
deserves for the lay me^ both alive and departed forgyuenes of sins or any
manner of help for them / bring out on title of the scripture to prove it with
all / If ye can bring no scripture / ansuer to this question / Whether is it a
commandment of god to all christen to receive the sacrament or no. Either it is
a commandment or no commandment / if it be no commandme^t then are not laymen
once in the year bound to receive the sacrament / nether ar prestes bound to
say me^ / If that it be a comma^dme^t / How ca^ a pressed deserve in doing that
for a layman that he is bound to do for him self? If it be a comun commandment
to all men / to receive the hole sacrament / god will not allow it that on man
shall kep the comma^dment for an other but will require the keeping of the
co^manme^dt / of every on of our selves. For if god would allow the keeping of the
commandment / of on man / for an other man / then neded no rich men / were
they never so deuelish go to the deuel for not keeping the commandme^t of god /
for then if prestes might kep the co^mandmentes for layme^ / and deserve the^
forgymenes of sins / they might hyre prestes to kep the commandmentes for
them that they might live lyk deuelles and dye like saints and have
everlasting life / But now let us se what the scripture says concerning this
/ that on man may receive the sacrament and keep the commandment of god for an
other / What soever a man sows (says the scripture) that shall he repe /
The self scripture says he that sowethe skarsely shall repe skarsly / of the
which places i gather / that he that sows nothing shall rep^ nothing Then i
reason thus / when the pressed says mes and receives the sacrament / the lay
men that are alive and the souls departed sow nothing / for the priest /
sowethe alone / then shall nether the ded lay men / nor the quik / repe any
thing / that is, shall receive no reward of god for the prestes sayng of mes
and receyuyng of the sacrament for them / for if the ded and quik should have
profit by the prestes receyuyng of the sacrament / when they received it not
their selves / then should they that sowed nothing / contrari to the scripture /
repe sum thing and have a reward for doing nothing More over as the five
folyshe virgins could get no part of the five wise virgins oil. when the
brydegrom came so they that do no god works their selves / shall have no part
of other men's good works / Then if the mes and the receyuyng of the
sacrament be a good work they that say not mes their selves or receive not the
sacrament their selves / shall have no part nor profit by the sayng of mes or
receyuyng of the sacrament of other that say mes and receive the sacrament /
How say ye also to this reason It that a priest cannot do for him self that
cannot he do for an other.

But by receyuyng of the sacrament he cannot deserve him self forgyuenes of
sins / then can he not deserve forgyuenes of sins by receyuyng of the
sacrament for other / as for layme^ and for the souls departed. That he cannot
deserve forgyuenes of sins for him self in receyuyng the sacrament / thus i
prove it, the pressed that is ready to receive the sacrament before he take it /
is either a good man and the servant of god and has his sins all forgyuen /
or he is an euel man and the servant of the deuel / and has not his sins
forgyue^ If he be a good man before he receive the sacrament and be the servant
of god and have his sins forgyue^ / then his receyuyng of the sacrament /
deserves not him the forgyuenes of his sins / for his sins was forgyue^
before or he received the sacrament. If the pressed a little while before he
receive the sacrament be an euel man and the servant of the deuel and have not
his sins forgyne^ / and so receive the sacrament he deserves by unworthy
receyuyng of the sacrament / the judgment and wrath of god and no forgynenes
of sins but more ponyshme^t for his new syn.

Then what is here to spare for the lay people and for the souls departed? If
it be true that when a lay man gives a priest ij pence or a grote to say mes
for him / and to receive the sacrament for him all that the priest deserves for
receyuyng of the sacrament is the layma^nes deseruyng / when the priest is a
hor monger and a dedly sinner / as many on be / then the prestes deseruyng of
the wrath of god for unworthily receyuyng of the sacrament for the layman /
must needs be the lay man's deseruyng / and so byeth he with his money the
wrath of god / Allmyghty god save me and all christen men from such
merchandise. Will ye yir say still that ye hold no traditiones of the pope
contrari to the word of god? Say ye that it is agreyng with the word of god /
or not co^trari to the word of god / that all the Psalms that are song in the
church / that all the Messes that are said in the church / should be song and
said in the old popes mother tongue which the people of england does not
understand / i will prove it co^trari to the word of god thowgh al they that
hold on the popes side would defend it to be god and lawful. It is a wonderful
thing to se how that ye blind bysshoppesr pete^d to hate the pope / and yet
love so well his works and his deeds that in all things ye follow him. as
nere as is possible on man to follow an other. The pope shaueth his head brother
the^ the comu^ sort of prestes do and has a distinct kind of aparel from all
other christen men also / and will be rekened hyer the^ his other brethern that are ministers of the word of god as well as he is / and that co^trari to the
word of god which makes all the aposteles of like autorite and not on above an
other and so do ye (...) / The pope forbyddeth to eat flesh many times in the
year as in lent and on the frydayes and yet sells licens for money to eat all
times / and so do ye.

The pope will that the canon law and the ceremonies be had in great reputation
and not to be put furthe of the church thoghe they hinder the prechyng of
gods word and the prayng with heart and spret / which ar the true and right
service of god / and so do ye and lest the pope should have any peculiar and
several ungodly properti to differ by from the apostelles of Christ that ye
should not have / the pop wills and commands in all places where he has
dominacion that all Psalms and all messes shall be said and song in his old
mother latin tongue thoge the people understand never on word of the latin tongue /
yet this does he in a token that the people hearing the romish tongue which is
latin should knowledge them selves to be under the se of Rome / ye Christen in
the popes tongue and bery in the popes mother tongue and sing all the Psalms that
^r song / in the popes mother tongue / and command straytly that all the things
above rehearsed shall be said song and don in no other tongue but in the popes
mother tongue which is the latin tongue / in a token that ye swerve not away from
the pope of rome. The jews which would never knowledge the pope to be their
head sing their service and Psalms in hebru / The greeks which have of long
time departed from the pope sing their service in their oun mother greek tongue /
the bemers which fell long ago from the pope have forsaken the popes mother
tongue and sing all the service in their oun tongue / The germans which of late
left the pope left also the popes tongue / and now sing all service and Psalms
in their oun duche tongue and so all cuntres which forsake the pope in very deed
and ernestly / forsake the popes ordinances and the popes romish tongue / as
touching syngyng Psalms and service therein. But ye bysshoppes of england ye
alon among all other nationes that forsake the pope / hold still the popes
ordinances and the service in the latin tongue. Ye thynk belyk that ye ar wiser
then all other nationes / How beit i shall prove that ye do clean contrari to
the word of god in syngyng the service in a tongue that the people does not
understood Saint Paul in xiiij chapter of the former epistel to the
corinthianes does amost no orher thing then disalow your syngyng and sayng in a
strange tongue in the church that the people does not understand. But if ye
require sum testimonies out of that chapter / here what Paul says

He that speaks in a tongue (that is in a langage that the comun people
understands not (speaks not unto men but unto god for noman hears him
(that is understands him) but he speaks secret priuites in the spret But he
that prophecieth (that is declares and opens the scripture) in atong that
the people understands he spekethe unto men profit for their souls
exhortation and comforth / He that speaks in a tongue profits him self but he
that prophetieth byldeth the congregation / And a little farther in the same
chapter. As often as ye mere to gether / every on of you hat this song his
doctrine his tongue his revelation / his interpretation / and let all things be
don to the profit of the congregation / So far Paul / What profit has the
unlearned man in hearing the gospel red in the latin tongue that he understands
not be it never so trymly red or chanted? Even as myche profit as a syk man
has of a phisitianes bill when the potecary redeth it over the syk man's
head in latin and ministers nothing to the syk man that is contained their in
Paul says more over whether any man speak in atong (that is in a speech that
the comum sort understands not) let it be don by ij together at the uttermost
iij and that by course and let on expound or tell what it means But if their
be no^ that will interpret or expound let him hold his peace and say nothing in
the church / but let him speak to him self and to god These ar the words and
commandment of god taught us by his holy apostel saint Paul / whereby your
latin messes and latin eue^ souges ar utterly condemned seeing they are said and
songin a tongue that the church understands not / and ye do not interpret and
declare it that is said in a tongue that the people does understand / Ar their no
more but three at the utter most in poules spekyngin in to^ges / at once? If
their be mo the^ three when thee is the co^mandme^t of god given by saint Paul
broken or no? I pray you what mean ye to say in latin to the lay people that ye
know well understands no latin at all / dn^s vobiscu^ / orate pro me fratres
/ and (...) missa est Either ye saythes words to god or to all the people / if
ye say the^ to god the^ ye bid god / be with god / and that is wisely do^ / wit
ye well / or if ye say the^ to the lay people either ye speak to the^ that they
should know what ye mean / if ye would that they should know what ye me an / why
do you speak latin to the^ that ye know can understand non / if ye speak latin
to the^ becaws they should not understand you / hold your to^ges and speak
nothing at al and the^ have ye gote^ your purpose / for the^ they shall not wit
what ye mean / and if ye hold oyur tongues ye shall not spend in vayn so myche
lib^ labor as ye do. Ansuer me to this before ye call me heretik. and when ye
have o^ce made a reso^able answer and confuted and ouercu^ned my resones / if i
stand styfly in my opiniones if and give not over to you the^ spare not but
call me heretik as often as ye will but if ye cannot ouercu^ these resones / which
if they were not of god might be easily ouercu^med and therefore will not answer
grant by holdyng of your peace / that ye ar ouercu^med / and give over your
hold and say peccauimus cu^ patribus nostris / we have don amiss with our
fathers Mor of thus shall ye hear here after / How happens this that nether ye
will read the scripture in the english to^g yor selves / to the lay people
nether will suffer the^ that ca^ read the scripture to read for it their souls
helt / and great comforthe of other that hear it red? It is with our all
strife and out of all dout / that ye love not Christ and would that all the lay
men were blind and had no knowledge of scripture no more then they had xx year
ago that ye might play your old practices / and have no man to look on / to
correct you / Even as a hoar monger when he sees a fair woman and would have
his pleasure of her would that it were nygh and that all other men were blind till
he had his pleasure / When the new testamentes came in first it was counted
heresi to have a new testament and many have been cruelly handled for sellyng of
new testaments in english / which thing syger of cambrydg can testifi if he
will as not only a seeing but also a felyng witness.

On noble canonist bought up half a prynt of new testamentes / and for the love
that he had to the maker of the testament / offered them up in a burnt
sacrifice to pleas vulcanus and the pope with all who at those days sat deply
in his conscience / This man left of burning of testamentes and other began to
burn men / and as yet have not made an end. But after that the king of his
goodness that god gave him had once granted that the new testament might be
openly boght and sold and that every man might have the new testament and read
it / ye bysshoppes for a great whil durst say nothing their to. Ye said as
little to the having of the hole bible in english / wiche the king an the spite
of your teache bro^g in to the church / that all me^ might know their duties /
redyng of it / till that ye had confirmed the popes doctrine with act of
parliament / and had slain and murdered the chief ma^teners of the bible next
unto the king. Then ye being loathe that your acts should be tried and examined
with the bible / went about and do so still to drive the bible out of the
church again / Ye have given commandment that no man shall read the bible that
any man may hear him read / afterward ye commanded that no man should read
the bible in service time / And because men should learn to keep your commandment
that is / whill ye red in the quere the popes service and the deuelles service
/ that no man should read the word of god / ye of late mundered on porter in
prison / for no other cause but for redyng of the bible / that other men should
not be to bold to read it / Ye never put any man to death yet for aduoutre / or
hordom / therefore ye reken it a greater offense to read the gospel I of saint
Johan in the service time and the words that Christ spoke / then to ly with
an hoar / And to read the words Omelie Gregorij Pape / in the popes tongue that
all the chirch may here them / is rekened to be gods service and to read the
gospel of Jesus Christ in the englis he tongue that seven or eight may hear / is
rekened of you the deuelles service / for ye forbid nothing but it that / ye
reken is the deuelles service / It follows then that ye reken the pope god and
Christ the deuel / for him reken ye god whose words to read and keep ye reken
is gods service.

And him reken ye the deuel or at least the son of the deuel / whose words to
read and to keep ye reken the deuelles service and ponish men for the redyng of
his words. These follow of your deeds / and because every man cannot gather
after this manner / as often as i se just occasion i shall let you and all england
know of your hereses and damnable opiniones and deuelysh deeds that ye do and
intend to do / which thing i would not do if i knew you not for obstinat
wrastlers against gods holy word. If ye say we would not utterly have the bible
suppressed but we would have it better translated / what time would ye have to
correct it / perchance so many years as the kings hyghnes shall live / and
then after his death ye have a good hope with the help of them whose childer ye
find / to hold it down till that the prince cum to perfect age and then to if ye
can. For the bible is the breathe of gods mouth wiche ye have red shall kill
your father antichrist and you. If ye say we would not have the bible out of the
church again but only we desire that gods service shall not be hyndered by
the layme^nes redyng / well the^ what call ye gods service / ye will say
ia^suer that all that is song and said in the quere is goddis service / as
thoge it that were red said or so^g in the bodi of the church were non of
gods service / This ansuer will i thus improve / the more part of it that is
red in the church is no scripture / as ar lying lege^des which ar bigger the^
the bible / seque^ces / secrets / colates co^iurynges / of water salt fyr and
bows / litani respo^des and such other / whose redyng sayng and syngyng cannot
be gods soruice / for Christ says / Matt. xv. they worship me in vayn that
teach the co^mandme^tes of men / and the learning of me^ / then seeing that the
lege^des and the colates ar made by me^ / and the clerks in the quere in
redyng the^ teach them it follows that they worship god in vayn / the^ is
their service vayn / gods service is not vayn service the^ the greater half
of that which is red in the quere is no^ of gods service / that is to wit
the lege^des colates co^iurynges / secrets seque^ces and such other / Now the
other part of it that is read in the quere is pure scripture / of whose heryng
layme^ have as myche profit as alay and unlearned man has of the heryng of a
latin play or comedi / Howbeit i will prove that eue^ the most part of that
scripture seeing that it is said and song contrari to gods mind is non of
gods service / in all them and in all other that say the scriptur with their
lips and not with their hertes / that is vndstand not what they sing and say
and lift not their minds up to god / as do all they that sing latin service
and understand no latin / as the most part of queresters syngyng men and soul
prestes and many body prestes also / commonly do / god commanded that the
scriptur should not be song or said in a strange tongue except it were straight
way exponded / that is not don / then is the scripture said and soug not after
gods mind their for it is not gods service so song and said / And that they
that understand not latin worship not god nor serve god with syngyng of the
scripture in latin thus i prouit. Johan 4. God is a sprete and they that
worship him must worship him in sprete and truth / that is unfeignedly with
heart and mind / so do not they that sing they wot not what Christ also Matthew
15. reproves such seruers and worshippers which nether understand nor marck
what they say in these words / this people draws ner hand me with their mouth
and worshippeth me with their lips but their heart is far from me / Now have i
proved that your service in the quere is not gods service / but vayn lip
labor except it be song and said with heart and mind as they do not which
understand not what they sing / except also it be scripture and song and said
after the ordinance of god / If it be gods service to sing in the quere the
Omelies of Popes / Legendes of saints / and such verses Sancte Mary's merits
bring us to heaven and all in the latin tongue / then must it much more be gods
service to read in the body of the church / the text of the scripture which is
better then the popes gloses / the acts of the Apostelles / and such other
textes of the scripture / No man cummeth to the father but through me / i am tha
way the truth and the life / Then why forbid ye the better for the wors / whi
for bid ye lay men to read the bible in your service time seeing the lay men may
have miche more profit of hearing of five words red in english that they
understand / then of v thousand words that they do not vndstand / be they
never so fyuely chopped champed or cha^ted? Paul says let all thing be don to
the edification and profit of the church / but your service song and said in
the latin tongue / is not for the profit of the church / therefore it is contrari
to the word of god that ye should sing the service or say it in the latin tongue /
If ye require the sum of all to gither in an argument take it unto you No man
is edified by hearing it that he does not understand / and therefore has the
king commanded that all layme^ shall learn their Pater nostet in english / but
the laymen understand not the service fayd and song in the latin tongue /
therefore they are not edified or made any better by hearing it in the latin tongue.

Is it agreyng with gods word that ye forbid all men both learned and lay
the hole half year save 12. days / to mary / and will suffer no man to be a
precher of gods word / or a minister of Christ's church except he for swear
marriage first / is it agreyng with gods word to say that apreste may not have
a wife by the word of god? I say that this your doctrine is the doctrine of the
deuel / for Christ aloweth marriage in all men and in all times / Honorable is
marriage among all me^ says Paul / and the same sayethe if they cannot for
bear and have not the gift of chastity let them mary / this commands god by
Paul to be don / at al tynes ye even in your holy lent time if a man have not
the gift of chastity. Ye have boldly and wikkedly given sentence in your
convocation house that a priest may not have a wife by the law of god and vit
can ye not show on letter in all the hole bible that forbyddeth prestes to have
wives / ye say that they may have no wives by the word of god and yet they may
have as i have proved by the bible / therefore ye reken their is sum thing the
word of god beside the bible i thynk that ye take the cano^ law for the word of
god / or at lest regard it as myche as the word of god / ye make men believe
that ye have scripture to prove your purpose with all / and yet the chief
setter out of this article / the noble waterer of the popes gardin / which of
his deeds has his name / when he was required of Martin Bucer what scripture
he had to prove that prestes might not mary / lyk a perfect canonist for lak of
scripture made this reason / The same autorite has the king over all the
prestes of his reame and his other subjects that a father has over his
chylder / But a father may forbid the prestes of his realm to mary. Then if
they mary when he forbids them to mary they break the commandment of god /
which says childer obey your fathers and mothers. Now let us se what
follows of this gardners argument / First it follows that the king has
autorite to forbid all men in his realm both that have the gifft of chastity
and ha it not to mary as long as they live and so utterly may by gardners
judgment destroy matrimoni / It follows of this argument / that once in time
past that it was not unlawful for prestes to mary that is to wit before the
king forbad prestes to mary / If follows of gardners reason that the king
forbad prestes marriages before god forbad them and that the king made the
marriage of prestes sin before god / and that it were no sin for a priest to mary
if that the king would not forbid prestes to mary.

Mark this well ye temporal lords and ye burgesses of the parliament how this
lying lim of the the deuel / when he is in germany can find out no scripture to
disprove prestes marriages with all / but only that the kyngis for byddyng of
prestes Marriages makes prestes Marriages unlawful and no other thing / and when
the kings hyghnes and ye put this matter to the elergy to be tried with the
scripture whither prestes might mary or no this with his fellows gave a plain
answer that by the word of god prestes might not mary / can ye abide ye noble
lords that these lying limbs of antichriste shall mok you thus and lie of the
king our master and say of him that he makes sin that god never made syn?

I trust ye will suffer them no longer for it is hy time to lok upon them. Then
when as ye master gardner with your other fellows can bring further never on
text of the scripture that this for said forbyddyng of marriage of prestes / and
of the marriage of laymen for the on half of the ye are / that it is the
doctrine of god i will prove you by a plain place of the scripture that i^ is
the plain doctrine of the deuel / Paul in the former epistel to Timothe / in
the forth chapter says pleynly that forbiddyng of Marriage is the doctrine of
the deuell / therefore seeing that the pope and ye teach the same doctrine ye
have gou to scool with the deuel / then when ye want scripture to prove your
doctrine with all say that an old aucient doctor holdethe the same opinion that
ye do / and understand doctor the deuel / for other autorite have non / Doctor
deuel the Bisshoppes scoolmaster always from mannis creation his dedely enemi
/ sekyng all the means that he could to pull man from god perceyuyng that man
had an vnsteable desire given him of god to in creas and multipli his kind /
and an unavoidable appetite (few except) there for to have natural company with
his appointed companion / labored all that he could / utterly to destroy
marriage / which thing if if he had brought to pas seeing that / childer must
needs be gotten / as many childer as should have been borne so many basterds /
should their have been born. At the gittyng of every child if should have gone to
the deuell / that is both the father and the mother / for they should have been
hormonger and hoar / the deuelles onn peculiar cattle and the child when it came
to age and gat a chilh it should have be cummed also the servant of the deuel /
and so should all hole mankind have becummed the deuelles dew possession. But
be cause if the deuel should have gone abou destruction of marriage in his oun
person / because he is haytful / he should have sped the wors / he came to a pope
holy heretic called montanus / and him he styrred up to writ against
matrimoni / and so he did / and taught that marriage should be broken / as
eusebius writes in the v. bok nf the Ecclesiastical stori and in the 15.
chapter. But Appolonius a good Christen man ouercam ^hys heretik and his
doctrine so that he lost all his credence and their with loft the deuel a great
nonbre of his true servants / Satan seeing that he could not sped by the means
of an (...) heretik he came to acertayne doctor and moved him to write against
marriage and that did he in a book which he wrote against vigilantium in these
words foloyng Bonum est mulierem non tangere / ergo / malum est tangere /
Nihil enim contrariatur bono nisi malum / Quam diu impleo mariti officium / non
impleo Christiani / Iubet Apostolus / Vt semper oremus / Si semper orandum est
nunquam coniugio seruiendum est / The englisch / of this doctoris words is
this / It is good not to touch a woman / then it is euel to touch her / for
their is nothing contrari to good but euel / So long as as i full fill the office
of (...) married man / i full fill not the office of a Christen man / The Apostel
byddeth us that we shall always pray / if that we must always pray we must not
give our selves to marriage / or to serve marriage / So far has the doctor
spoken / This doctoris name was Ieronimus / which in this point erred sore /
and gave many other occasion to er affter bym which believed men with our
scripture / Howbeit Augustine writing de bono coniugij / and other doctores did
sufficienty / overthrow this error of jerome / and so was the deuel twice
disypoynted (...) he would not give over his matter so / but ever sought new
shifts / and then he came to his vicare in earth the bisshops from / and him he
styrred and moved to destroy matrimoni and to allow common stews / that they
that lift might cum thither to worslip him / promysyng him for his labor to be
the richest man in the world and of greatest estimation / The pope / hearing
these promises straight way went about to destroy matrimoni / and first he
com^anded all that were his ghostly childer and had his marck in their crowns
should forswear marriage / and he made a law that no man should be allowed to be a
precher in christ's church except he forswear marriage first / and fayn would
he have forbidden all laymen to have married to / But when they would not
forswear mariag for him yet he lokked up marriage even from all laymen / for the
space / of the on half of the year save xij days / Whereby the deuel and the
world might well parceyue his good will that he had utterli to destroy marriage
at the lest to move all men to thynk that marriage was sin / and that the state
of marriage was a sinful state / And by the help of this his breare / the deuel
gat many a pray / (...) the germans seeing that this forswearyng of marriage was
the hye way to the deuel wrote ernestly against this forbyddyg of marriage and
against the folysh and ungodly vows / and against the pope him self and his
autorire and riches which the deuel gave him / and at the leynght utterly
forsaked the pope and all his vows and forswearings of marriage wihtall other
lyk traditiones.

After the germans / the king our master commanded you ernestly to drive out
the pope out of all places of his dominion also and to preach ernestly against
him / then the deuel perceyuyng that the king was a bout to drive out the pope
of his ream / was a ferde that the king should drive out with the pope for
swearyng of marriage / unlawful vows / the stews and all other ordinances that
the pope made as the germans did when they bannysshed away the pope / And
their fore he came to you whom the king had appointed to drive out the pope / and
desired you that ye would / manteyn the stews and that ye would not drive out of
england the forswearyng of marriage / but that all thing concerning marriage of
prestes should continue as it had continued sense the time of Gregori the seuent
/ and he promised you so long as ye would do so that he would help you to hold
still your temporal lands / your great honor / riches / and dignite / And so
my lords for the upholdyng of your pompos state ye will not drive out of
endlond the forbiddyng and forswearyng of marriage / for of that matter ye fear
that your honor and estimation does hang. When ye shall make me an answer to
this book / tell me what autorite have ye beside the autorite of doctor deuel
to forbid marriage or to compel any man to for swear marriage / seeing saint Paul
saycht in the j. Epist. to the Corint. in the vij. chapter. I have no
commandment of virgins / that is i have no autorite of god to bynd any man or
woman to live single with out marriage / If that saint poul have no autorite to
compel any man or woman to live with out marriage / the king has no autorite
to for bid any man to mari / for saint poul had as myche autorite as the king
in spiritu all matters / prove the contrari if ye can / If the king whom ye
grant to be head of the church have not that autorite / of whom have ye that
autorite / if ye say ye have any such autorite then ye make your selves above
the king. In your answer tell me how it happens that this place of Paul unto
Timothe makes not for prestes marriages.

A Bishop must be the husband of on wife / I say that ye must either let this
place serve for prestes marriages / or ellis ye must lose all your temporal
lands / and have nothing where with all ye may keep hospitalite / which Paul
requires in a Bishop / For thus reason ye with this text for your temporal
lands / A bisspop must be herberos / but with out temporal lan^es that can he
not be therefore must a Bisspop have temporal lands. This text of Paul is as fre
for me as for you / A bishop must be the husband of on wife but with out a
wife he cannot be the husband of on wife ergo he must have on wife. If ye
expoud this place of Poul / Oportet Episcopum esse vnius vxoris maritu^ / hoc
est fuisse vnius vxoris maritum / a Bishop must be the husband of on wife /
that is a Bishop must have been the husband of on wife / Ia^ of you / whether
all these things that paul speaket of here / ar requieed in a man that is to be
chosen a Bishop / or ar they required all / in him on ly / that is chosen all
ready / or theyar required both in one that is to be chosen and in him that is
all ready chosen / If ye say that these properties ar required all / in him alon
that is chosen all ready / then is he eligible and may be chosen to be a Bishop
/ which is a dronkerd / a murderer and has ij wives so that affter that he is
chosen / he benon of this sort. If ye say that these proerties / to be fautles /
to bethe hussband of on wife / watchyng sobre / louly / herberus / etc. be
required in him on ly that is not yet chosen a Bishop but stands in the
election to be chosen / and not in him that is chosen all ready / then may a
Bishop after that he is chosen once and made Bishop be / full of fautes the
husband of many wives a sleper a dronkerd / hye minded / and vnherberos which
thing / to grant is an inconvenient / Therefore ye must grant that these
properties ar both required in him that stands to be chosen / and in him that
is chosen all redi. Therefore both the man that standerh to be chosen and he
that is now chosen all ready a Bishop must be faurles / the husband of on wife
modest herberous watchyng sobre etc. Thorfore either grant that paul requiret in
a Bishop that is chosen that he have nomo wives but on / and that he may have
on / or grant that Paul requires not in a Bishop that is made all ready to be
herberous For those things that Paul sheaket of in on mode / on tence / in on
text / all tegether / he does elike require at on time / or ellis reprove in
on time / then seeing that he says in on mode tence and text together a
Bishop must be the husha^de of on wife / sobre and herberous / then does he
clyke require that a Bishop should haue^ a wife or nomo wives but on as he
requires that he should be herberous and sobre / Then if having of a wife be
long not to a bysthop then sobbrenes and keeping of hospitalite be lo^geth not
to him If he be not bound to kep hospitalite / he must have no lands to kep
hospitalite / If ye say that oportet esse must signifi oportet fuisse that is /
must be / must be taken on ly for must have been the^ it is not required by your
gloss in a man that is a Bishop to be fautles / to have but on wife / to be
watchyng / sobre / modest / herberous / fit to teach / no wyn drinker / no
smiter / not given to fylthy lucre / but it is sufficient if he have been all
these / He is sufficient Bishop by your exposition if he have been fautles /
though he be as full of open crimes / as a leopard is full of spots / It forces
not / if he have iij wives and xxx hores so that he has had no mo wives but
on / It maket no matter if he be a slepyng and adom dog so that he has been
watchyng and dilligent / he need not to be sobre when he is once made Bishop /
but he may occupi all manner of exces so that he has be sobre before he was
Bysshope / It skilleth not whether he be modest or no / it is inoghe if he have
be^ / It is not required in him to be harberous / fit to teach / no wyn
dryncker no smiter after that he is made a Bisshope so that when he was a
scolar in cambridg or orford he has been herberous fit to teach no smiter and
no dronkerd lie may be then after that ye be once made Bisshopes / by your
turnyng of esse in to futsse / full of all sins / the husbands of an C.
wives slepyng dogs / dronckerdes / and murderers / And if a man say unto you
Bysshopes / Paul sayet ye may not be murderers ye may not / be dronkerdes ye
may have no mo wives then on ye may by iuglyng of esse in to fuisse that is by
iuglyng of be in to have been / say yis. and that this is not the meaning of
Paul / for Paul requires not now when we are once made Bysshoppes that we should
be sobre and have but on wife / but that before we were Bisshopes we should have been sobre and the husbands / of on wife / et cet. And so now we may be what we
list / wherefore i meruel the les that so many Bysshoppes which have been in
canbrydge and exford before they were Bisshopes / watchyng and fit to teach / ar
be cummed slepyng dogs that dar not bark / and more fit to flatter then to
teach gods word puerly with out the leuin of the doctores seeing that they are
discharged from all thing that Paul requires of aryght bishop by this glos a
bishop must be / that is a bishop must have been. But acordyng to their glos /
the honest common people speaks of them / after this wise / how continuethe
doctor Ericeus in preaching gods word and in promotyng the gospel / an other
answers by and by / qui fuit. But ye care as myche for the common report as
an hoar cares to be called a hoar / ye be so far past al shame. But to
conclude this matter.

That doctrine that forbids it that Christ ordened is contrari to Christ /
but your doctrine forbids it that Christ ordened ergo your doctrine is
contrari to the doctrine of Christ.

Is it agreyng with the word of god that stews shall be allowed and manteyned
in a Christen kingdom? I reken no. The stews is a place where as the deuel may
be openly served with out any pomishment / but in a christian king don the
deuelles service oght not to be suffered openly to be don with out pomishment /
therefore the stews ough not to be suffered in a Christen kingdom Where as the
life is allowed the learning that teaches the living is also allowed.

Then if ye allow the cause ye must needs allow the effect / ye allow the stews
therefore ye allow hordom / if ye allow hordom ye approve the doctrine that
teachech hordom. But that is heresi therefore to allow stews is to allow heresi /
If the at ye would suffer prestes to mari in any place of engo^ld me^ might
gather that ye allowed the books that teach that prestes may be laufully married
but when ye ponishe prestes that mari with death / men may gather that ye allow
not the books that teaches that prestes may mary / So when ye pomish / not
hordom but appoint certain places for it / if folowethe that ye allow it and the
books / that teach that hordom is no sin.

And this follows of your alowyng of the stews / As he that gives lodgyng to
a right prophet / as Christ says shall have the reward of a right Prophet /
So as Johan / in his Epistle says he that lodges a false Prophet is partaker
of all his evil deeds / Even so he that wittyngly gives lodgyng to hormongers
and hores shall be partaker of all the hordom that they commit / but ye grantyng
hores and hoar mongers a place where as they may lie together and serve the
deuel / grant them logyng therefore ye ar partakers of all the hordom that is
don in the stews. But steven master stewerd of the stews / priapus and keeper
of the popes gardin peraduentur will defend his tenantes and say we up hold the
stews for the auoydyng of a farther inconvenience. If their were no stews in
london seeing their ar so many wyueles and wanton curtiers / their / their would
great violence be offered unto me^nes wives / and much more aduoutre should
reygne then reyneth now. But this polytik answer will not serve for s. Paul
sayethe romans 3 chapter / euel is not to be don that good may insew their upon.
If it be once granted to all men to mary / and yet they that are married will
commit aduoutre / and they that have liberti to mary will not mary but will be
hoar honters and wedlok breakers still / it shall be as lauful by the law of
god to hang such as to hang thieves ye and more lauful / For that offense that
is greater is worth greater pomishment. Salamon in the sixth chapter of the
proverbs says that aduoutre is the greater offense then is theft / therefore
if theft be wortly hangyng / aduouteri is worthi it and a greater ponishme^t
beside. s. Paul saeth in the fifth chapter of the epistel to the ephesianes /
let not hordom be so myche as once named among Christen men / it that is
forbidden to be named is forbidden to be don / but hordom is for bydden to be
named then myche more is it for bydden to be don and allowed / Paul calls
hordome leven / and will / that such as be aduouters and hor mongers should be
excomunicated and not suffered to cum among other christian people till they were
ashamed of their sins / and in tended to commit that offense no more / i.
Corint. in the v. chap. Allmyghty god Deuteronomij xxiij. forbyddeth that any
hores and hoar mongers shall be suffered among his folk in these words / Of the
doghters of Israel non shall be hores / and of the sons of Israel non shall
be horemongers / If english people be spirltual Israelites this commandment also
perteyneth unto the^ / then is it not lawful to suffer in england any hores or
hormongers. Then down must the stews for their bodily fornication / as the
abbayes was put down both for their fornication both bodily and ghostly / Now
hauei tried the chief of your popish ordinances and traditiones and i have
found them contrari to the word of god / Now is there nothing to let me but
that i may conclude my for said argument with out any co^tradictio^ or gayn
sayng / who soever holds still the popis doctrine which is contrari to the
word of god holds still the pope that the king would have driven out of
england / but i have proved sufficiently that ye hold still the popis doctrine
which is contrari to the word of god / Therefore i have proved that ye hold
still the pope that the king would have driven out of england / Bethys time i
trow that the fox is found out / and they are known that manteyn him and hold
him still in this realm after that the king has commanded him to be utterly
bannyshed out of all places of his dominion / If such a pore man as i should
hold still in england the kings enemi that he commanded me to drive out his
realm i should be taken as a traitor / but ye hold still the kings enemi that he
commanded you to drive out of his realm / then whether may a man call you
tratoures or no? If ye be no traytores prove in your answer that ye will send
me that ye hold no doctrine of the pope contrari to the word of god / If ye be
traytores and heretics and unlearned asses and have no knowledge but in the
canon law and in old gloses and fantases of men / answer nothing to my
arguments but forbid my book to be red / and in holdyng your peace consent
that all that is said of you in this book is true. If ye be learned men and
have knowledge in the scripture and love learning answer me like learned men
and be not like privy murderers which will not tell a man that they murder
wherefore they kill him but / suddenly with out any axyng of any question sley him
suddenly / Tell me by the scriptur where i have said amyss and if i recant not
call me heretic and do to me as ye should do to am hethen man / But if ye
comdemn my book and cannot ouercum it by the word of god i shall set a play of
your mischeuous tyranny in latin that all the learned men that are now alive and
the age for to cu^ shall know you what ye be / and what ye have been. Allmyghty
god give you grace to amend. Amen.

An addition to the reder.
AFter that i had finisshed this book it was told me that the bysshopes had
made an act that none but gentle men and gentle wymen might read the scripture
and certain rychmen / But i will ax the autores of that act whyther they
suffer the gentelles and the rich to read the scripture for their souls
health / or for their pastyme / If they suffer them to read it for their
sowles health /

Died not Christ as well for crafts men and pore men as for gentle men and
rich me^ and would not christ that the pore laboryng men should have where
with they might cu^forthe their sowles as well as rich me^ and gentle men? If
they let the gentles and the rich read the scripture for their pastyme / then
they have owr savior christ in great estimation which tayke his testamente
for a geste to make pastyme with / But sum polityke man percha^ce will say The
rich me^ and the nobles ar wyser the^ the pore people and can order it well and
so can not the ignorant pore people well / beside that their ar mo gentle fools
the^ yeme^ fools no^bre compared to no^bre / as the fond larde of this town
and foud larde of that town and beside that this younger brother and that has
the lands because the elder is a fool do testifk (which thing cha^cethe by the
pomishme^t of god for their falls cu^mynge to their lands) what so ever thou
best that for any such caws driuest pore men from the scripture i say that
thou art on of the pharisees foles which said / Turba haec quae no^ nouit
lege^ execrabilis est / this comune sort of the people which understands not
the law is acursed. I ax also the autores of this act vhome i take to be
burning bysshoppes / whether the 4. Eua^gelistes wrote truly the deeds of
Christ and his prechynges and whether their is any thing in the acts of the
apostelles and in the 4 gospelles beside christ's prechynges and deeds and the
apostelles prechynges and deeds that can make a laboryng man an heretic if he
read it or no? Iax whether a man may read christ's prechynges and the story of
his life with out ieperdy of heresy? If ye say that a pore man may not red
christ's prechhynges and dedest with out ieperdy of heresy i ax them whether
ama^ may read bishop tu^stalles sermon that he made with out ieperdy of heresy
or no? if ye grant / then ye reken a man more wyser then god seeing that a
bishop can make a sermon that pore men may read with out any ieperdy of heresy
and that Christ could make no^ such but as the pore people if they were not
forbidden to read them should fall in to many heresies by the redyng their of to
be short whosoever forbids a man's sermon to be red of the comuu people /
the same would forbid the self people to he ar the maker of the sermon to
preach it as it is written / but ye bisshoppes forbid the pore people to read
christ's sermones / ergo if christ were in england and would preach the self
same preachinges as the Evangelists have written them ye would forbid that the
people should to hear christ preche them / If this argument be not good reprove
it in your answer and solute it not with a fire or a rope as ye use comu^ly
to do God send you his holy sprete. Amen
