A worthy Mirror, wherein you may Mark, An excellent discourse of a breeding
Lark.
To the tune of new Rogero.
By reading whereof, perceive well you may,
What trust is in friends, or in kinsefolke to stay.
A Lark sometimes did breed,
within a field of Corn:
And had increase when as the grain
was ready to be shorn.
She wary of the time,
and careful for her nest:
Debated wisely with her self,
what thing to do were best:
For to abide the rage.
of cruel Reapers hand:
She knew it was to perilous,
with safety for to stand.
And to dislodge ^er brood,
unable yet to fl^e:
(Not knowing whether to remove)
great harms might hap thereby.
Therefore she meant to stay,
till force constraind to fleet,
And in the while for to provide,
some other place as meet:
The better to provide,
the purpose of her mind:
She would forthwith go seek abroad,
and leave her young behind:
But first she had them all,
attend their mothers will:
Which careful was for to eschew,
each likelihood of ill.
This Corn is ripe (quoth she)
w^erein we nestled are:
The which (if ^^de preuents not harms)
might cause our mortal care.
Therefore to fence with skill,
the sequ^ll of mishaps:
I will provide some other place,
for fear of after clappes.
Whilst I for this and food,
am flowen hence away,
With h^edfull ears attentive be,
what comers by do say.
Thus said, she vaunst hers^lfe,
upon her longest toe:
And mounted up into the skies,
still singing as she flow*
Anon she home returnde,
full fraught with choice of meat:
But lo, (a sudden change) her Birds
for fear could nothing eat.
Therewith aghast she cried.
what how? what means this?
I charge you on my blessing* tell
what thing has chanst amiss?
Are ^hese my welcom^s home,
or thanks for food I have?
Ye wo^ted were with chyrping cheer,
to gape before I gave.
But now such quames oppress.
your former quiet kind:
That (quite transformde) dumb mute things
and senseless soul I find.
The prime and eldest Bird,
(thus cheeki) began to say:
Alas dear Dame such news we heard,
since you were flowen away:
That were it not the trust,
that we ^^pose in you:
Our lives were lost: remediless,
we know it well ynouw:
The owner of the plot,
came hither with his Son:
And said to him, this Wheat must down,
it is more then time it were done.
Go get thee to my Friends.
and bid them come to morn:
And tell them that I crave their helps,
to reap a piece of Corn.
The Lark that was the Dam,
stood in a dumpe a while:
And after said, his friends (quoth he)
and then began to sm^le.
Tush, friends are hard to find,
true friendship seeld appears:
A man may miss to have a friend,
that lives old Nestors years.
True Damon and his friend*
long ere ou^ time were dead:
It was in Greece, a great way hence,
w^^re such true love was bred:
Our Country is too cold,
to foster up a friend:
Till proof be made, each one will say,
still yours unto the end.
But try in time of need,
and all your friends are flowen.
Such fruitless seed, such ^^^ale stay,
in faithless friends be sown:
Therefore be of good cheer,
revive your dulled sprights:
Expel the care, that causeless thus,
bereau^s you of delights.
Let not surmized fear,
deprive your eyes of sleep:
My self will be amongst you still,
that safely shall you keep.
And swear eene be the Tuft,
that grows upon my crown:
If all his help be in his friends,
this Corn shall not go down.
The young assured by her,
that such an oath did swear:
Did pass the time in wanted sleep,
and banished former fear:
And when the drousie night,
was fled from gladsome day:
She bad them wake^ and look about,
for she must go her way.
And said I warant you,
these friends will not come here:
Yet notwithstanding listen well,
and tell me what you hear.
Anon the Farmer came,
enra^ed well nigh mad:
And swear, who for ^^pends on friends.
his case is worse then bad:
I will go fetch my kin*
to help me with this gear.
In things of greater weight then this,
their kindred shall appear:
The Larkes, their Dam returned,
inf^r^ed her of all:
And how that he himself was gone,
his kindred for to call.
But when she heard of kin,
she laughing cried amain:
A pin for kin, a fig for friends,
yet kin the worst of twain.
This man himself is poor,
though wealthy kin he have:
And kindred now a days does quail,
when need compels to crave.
No no, he shall return,
with ill contented mind:
His pains shall (...)sse of time,
no succor he shall find.
They all are so addict,
unto their private gain:
That if ye lack power to requite,
your suits are all in vain.
My self am ever chargde,
with harvest ye may see:
And n^arer as my skin then shirt,
this shall their answer be.
Therefore as ^a^st of friends,
so say I now of kin:
We shall receiu^ no hurt by them,
no^ he no profit^ win:
Yet listen once again,
w^^t now his refuge is.
For kindred sh(...)be like to friends,
be well assured of this:
I must go furnish up*
a nest I have begun.
And will return and bring you meat,
as soon as it is done.
Then up she clam the Clouds,
with such a luster Lay:
That it reioyst her yonglings hearts,
as in their nest they lay:
And much they did commend,
their Mothers lofty gate.
And thought it long till time had brought
themselves to such estate:
Thus whilst their twinkling eyes,
were rouing too and fro:
The saw whereas the Farmer came,
who was their mortal foe.
Who after due complaints,
thus said in the end.
I will from henceforth trust my self,
and not to kin nor friend.
Who gives me glozing words,
and fail me at my need:
May in my Pater noster be,
but never in my Creed.
My self will have it down,
since needs it must be so:
For proof has taught me too much wit,
to trust to any mo.
The bi^ds that listening lay,
attentive to the same:
Informde their mother of the whole,
^
Ye mary then (quoth she)
the case now altered is.
We will no longer here abide,
I always feared this:
But out she got them all,
and trudged away apace*
And through the corn she brought the^ safe
into another place.
God send her (...)ke to shun,
both H^u^e and Fowls gin,
And me the hap ^o ^auth^ need,
of friend, nor yet of kin.
Imprinted at London, by Richard Ihones, dwelling near unto Holborne Bridge.
1589.
