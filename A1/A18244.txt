variations of Expressing, in English verse.

By Sr. Richard Baker Knight.

LONDON Printed by Anne Griffin, and are to be sold by Anne Bowler dwelling at
the sign of the Marigold in Paul's churchyard. 1636.

To the Reader.
A Lover of Learning, translated these^ verses of Cato into English, some
twelve years since: whose labor, I cannot blame: but tying himself, strictly
to the words; he could not always, either so fully, or so gracefully, express
the mening: for indeed, the words of one language, cannot always be reached,
by the very same words of another: which made an Able man, in this cause to
say: Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere. And therefore seeing the sense
especially in precepts, is principally to be regarded, there is justly a
liberty given, in this kind, not only to use Periphrases, but Paraphrases
also, as the cause may require, which liberty if I be censured by any to have
used too liberally: Yet so long as Sensus est in tuto, and nothing is said, but
what is drawn, Epotentia verborum: I expect to be excused at least, if not
commended: And if many of these, seem rather Paraphrases, or rather Collateral
Conceits then translations: yet seeing they tend all to the same sense: and
that the direct translations are sent before, as set always next the latin:
they are but after the fashion of young men; who wear thin clothes, in cold
winter, but have good warm wast-cotes under them, and some men, may be of that
disposition, to take as much delight, in the conceit of the Expressing^ as in
the expressing of the conceit-And indeed, this kind of writing, seems not
only away of meditation, but a Fruit: Not only an Exercise, but a Dilating of
Invention; and if there were nothing else, but the Variety; we see, how much
the Eye, is delighted with variety of colors, in the same object; the Ear,
with variety of Descant upon the same Plain song; and even Nature herself,
seems delighted with it: For, who doubts, but into one form of a Flower, she
could have infused all kind ofsents; and all, of sappes, but that she takes a
pleasure, in the variety of Forms. Some man will perhaps say; Here is variety
indeed; but one well done were better then all: what good does choice, where
All is Refuse stuff? It is true: but let this man bring better stuffes out of
his warehouse; and then, let these be thrown away: till then, he may content
himself with these; They may keep him warm, though not make him fine. And
seeing there is variety of Judgments; it is not unfit, to tender them, variety
of Expressings: some may take better with one Judgment: some, with another:
and oftentimes, one Expressing, gives luster to another, and makes the reason,
which lay hid before to look abroad: which is not yet, another thing; but the
same thing, in another light: and lastly, being Praecepts of Morality; they
cannot have too many allurements. How soever it be; the work I am sure, is
such, as need not repent me, of one month spent in writing it: Nor thee,
whosoever thou art of one hour spent in reading it. I have quoted in the
margent such places in divine writings, as are consonant and agreeing with
these Precepts of Cato; that we may see, how far it has pleased God, to
illuminate even Heathen men, in matters of Morality. And I intended, to have
set at the end, a Pattern of the like variety in Latin; done either by Virgil,
or by Ausonius: and translated in a greater variety into English: but
considering, this present work is it self, nothing else, but variations: I
have chosen rather to omit it, least it might be thought, a supernumerarie
idleness: yet thus much, we may gather by it; that even the Ancients scorned
not, this variety of expressing; either as an exercise to the Writer, or a
delight to the Reader; and seeing it has been now so long forborne; it may
come in also, as a novelty: and so I may suppose my self to have two good
supporters, (variety and novelty) to help to bear out my own imperfections.

Now for the Cato, that was the Author of these verses, whether it were a
Person, or but a Name only, (as Cicero called his book De senectu^e Cato
Major, to give it the more luster of gravity) it is uncertain, but certain
it is, what Cato it was, is nothing certain: and not much more certain, what
time he lived; only Io. Scal. by some probable conjecture gathers: that he
lived, about the times of the Emperors Commodus and Severus: which might well
be: seeing the saeculum of years, about an. Dom. 170.
next proceeding; was in sobriety of manners, amongst the Romans, of all other,
the most flourishing. And though the Emperors themselves were not yet
Christians; yet they made approches toward it, in Moral Doctrine, as near, as
could be: as, well testifies that excellent Book of Morality: written by the
learned Emperor, Marcus Aurelius Antonius; father unto Commodus: which, to the
great commendation of the Translatour, is lately published amongst us: out of
which perhaps this Cato, whosoever he was, might make choice of some special
Precepts: and put them, into short Disticks; for the better reteining them in
memory. And for my self; if any man think me Repuerascere; and to enter upon
a work, that were fitter for a school boy: let him know, that one Planudes,
long since, and of late, Joseph Scaliger, two excellent men, and of singular
learning; have Both of them, thought it no disparagement to their gravity, to
translate them into Greek; as, many learned men have likewise done into other
languages; whose Examples, I dare boldly oppose to the Censure of any, or all
Inferior Judgments.

Cato Variegatus.
SI Deus est. Animus, nobis ut carmin^^ dicunt:
Hic tibi praecipue, sit p^ra mente c^lendus.
1 If God a Spirit be, as Poets write:
He must be worship, with a mind upright.
Or thus,
1 The chiefest duty of thy life is this:
To serve God purely, who a spirit is.
Or thus,
1 As God, in truth a Spirit is, so He
In spirit and in truth, must worship^ be.
Or thus,
1 Gods outward worship, must not be neglected:
But it is the inward that is most respected.
Or thus,
1 God must be served with Tongue; with every part:
But no such service, as an upright Heart.
2 Plus Vigila semper, Ne^ somno deditus este:
Nam diu^nr^a quies, Vitiis alimenta ministrat.
2 Wake always more, and be not given to sleep: Pro. 6. 9. and 19. 15. and
10. 13. and 24 30. 33.

Much sleep does vices, both Beger and Keep,
Or thus.
2 Give not thy self to sleep, but waking rather:
Much sleeping, is to vice both N^rce and Father.
Or thus,
2 Use waking more, and be (...) given to sloth:
From whence all vices have both birth and growth.
Or thus.
2 Sleep not too much: vices will soon be dead.
If with the milk of sloth, they were not fed.
Or thus.
2 Use walking more, yield not when sleep (...):
Much sleeping is the soil that manures Vices.
Or thus,
2 A dr^wsie body, makes the mind be such (...)
He Is good for no good, that loves sleeping much.
Or thus,
2 Confine thy sleep; but do not banish it,
Though much be too much; yet a Fit is fit.
Or thus,
2 Not sleep, but sleeping much, must be withstood:
Much resting makes men restie to all good.
Or thus,
2 Hold sleeping short; Hold watchfulness in price:
Much resting is the Exercise of Vice.
Or thus,
2 Be walking more, sleep but what needs thou must:
Much sleep breeds in the mind a kind of (...).
Or thus,
2 (...)
Or thus,
2 (...)
Or thus,
2 Sleep is both Prodigals, and Misers Crime:
It Hoords yet wastes, the ch^efest Treasure, Time.
Or thus,
2 Much Sleep, is a Betraying Virtues Ward:
It ties the senses hands, which are her Guard.
Or thus,
2 Much Opium does the senses overcome:
And what is sleep, but Natures Opium?
Or thus,
2 Though Sleep, the name of Life's refreshing merits:
Yet much Sleep, is a surfeit to the Spirits.
Or thus,
2 Sleeping, is as the oil of our Life's Lamp:
Little, Refreshes: Too much, makes a Dampe.
Or thus,
2 Be Master of thine Eyes; not They of thee:
Sleep makes a Drone; it is waking makes a Be.
3 Virtutem primam esse puta, Compescere lingnam. Iam. 3. 21. Pro. 10. 19.
Ecclus 5. 13 and 20. 1. 2.

Pr^ximus Ille De^, qui scit ratione tacere.
3 Count it a Virtue chief, thy Tongue to bridle;
He Is next to God, whose words are never Idle.
Or thus,
3 It Is a great Gift, to speak in sense and season;
But greater far, to hold Ones Tongue with reason.
Or thus,
3 What means the double Fence, the Tongue about,
Of Teeth and Lips, but least it should break out?
Or thus,
3 Many can roll the Tongue; and make it run,
But Turn, and make a S^oppe, is hardly done.
Or thus,
3 The Tongue, has this one rare, yet common Notion:
It Virtue shows, no less in Rest, then Motion.
Or thus,
3 Speak not at all, or else speak wisely; least
It show thee, First a Man, and then a Beast.
Or thus,
3 The stronger the Tongue is, the man's the weaker:
He that can hold his Tongue, is the best speaker.
Or thus,
3 The tongue, both stirs Debate, and makes it Cease:
He holds Peace best, that best can hold his peace.
Or thus,
3 The Tongue may thus, be Encreast, or Decreast;
Rul'de well, It makes an Aug^ll, Ill, a Beast.
4 Sperne Repugnando tibi t^ Contrarius esse:
Conueniet ^uss^, qui secum dissides ipse.
4 Take head, ^est to thy self thou Crossing be: Pro. 26. 7. Eccles. 9. 4. 29:
and 5. 10.

Who thwarts himself, with whom can he agree?
Or thus,
4 Look that thy deeds and words be Prayers: for He
That's odd to himself, with none can even be.
Or thus,
4 If thou with others, would all quarrels Cease^
B^g^^ne first, with thy self to be at peace.
Or thus,
4 Be sure thy self, and Thou, be One; for One
In pieces with himself, can piece with none.
Or thus.
Be constant to thy self, and do not rome:
He Is but a Vagabond, that has no Home.
Or thus,
4 When thou art gone one way; do not decline:
A crooked Rule, can never make straight line.
Or thus,
4 Fall not out with thyselfe; but still be one:
He can be no man's friend, that is not his own.
Or thus,
4 Be none of those, of whom a man may say
Two can agree, if one be ou^o'th way.
5 Si vitam in spicias hominum, si denique mores:
Quum culpas alios, Neme sine crimine vivit.
5 If on the lives of men, thou cast thy thoughts;
Stand not a blaming some; for All have faults
Or thus.
5 If lives of men, be looked into and sought:
Some more, some less; but None, without his fault,
Or thus,
5 Look into all men's lives, and you shall see
Not this; or that man; but all, faulty be.
Or thus,
5 This you shall find, if to men's lives attend:
The most are stark naught; and the best may mend.
6 Quae nocitura tenes, quamvis sint eara, relinque.
V^^litas opibus praeponi tempore debet.
6 Leave off the things, though dear, which hurt thy health:
For safety always, must take place of wealth.
Or thus,
6 For bear things hurtful, though thou hold them dear;
Better, hard Fare; then surfeit with good Cheer.
Or thus,
6 What thou holdst hurtful; make of it no store:
Better, be safe with less; then spoyld with more.
Or thus,
6 Not Gold, if over weight, worth keeping think:
Better, go empty, safe; then laden, sink.
Or thus,
6 Please not thy fancy, to displease thy sense:
Profit sometimes, yields to convenience.
7 Constans and lenis, vt Res expostulat, Esto:
Temporibus mores, sapiens sine crimine mutat.
7 Be Constant or Remiss, as is the case:
For wise men, change their course, with time and place.
Or thus,
7 Be stern, or mild, as thou the cause do find:
For change of time, makes wise men, change their mind.
Or thus,
7 Be gentle, or sever, as cause may be:
To change with time, is wise men's Constancy.
Or thus,
7 To be now sharp, Now gentle; ^s no Crime:
Wisdom makes men, Chamaelions of time.
Or thus,
7 It Is no fault, to be stern, then mild again:
Time makes Chamaelions of the wisest men.
Or thus.
7 If men, to one thing, be Now prone, Now loath:
The difference of time may warrant Both.
Or thus,
7 Sternenesse, Remissness, Harshnesse Lenity,
Are All good: and None good, as cause may be
8 Niltemere Vxori, de servis Creed querenti:
Saepe etenim mulier, quem Coniux diligit, Odit.
8 Blame not a servant straight, thy wife reproves:
For, women hate them often, their Husband loves.
Or thus,
8 A wifes complaints of servants, often savor
Not of their faults, but of her Husbands savor.
Or thus,
8 Your wives complaints of Servants, hark not to:
Perhaps she loves them not, because you do.
Or thus,
8 Blame not straight, servants when your wife makes moan
She therefore finds fault, because you find none.
Or thus,
8 When servants often, you hear your wife accuse:
If they be of your choice, she cannot chuse^
Or thus,
8 Condemn not servants though your wife reprove them:
It Is Cause enough of her hate, that you love them.
Or thus,
8 Complain of servants, needs your wife must do:
She cannot love a servant; and you too.
9 Quumque mones aliquem, nec se velit ille ^oneri:
Sitibi sit carus, ^ ol^ defistere Captis.
9 When thou warn'st one, that take no warning will:
If he thy friend be; give him warning still.
Or thus.
9 Warning a friend, that does thy warning slight:
Yet hold thy course still: and Do Friendship, Right.
Or thus.
9 If warning thou a friend, he leave not Erring:
Yet Err not thou, in leaving off, Deterring.
Or thus,
9 Warning a friend, that takes no admonition;
Yet warn him still: Continuance works Contrition.
Or thus.
9 Telling a friend his faults; it is fault as much
In thee, to leave; as in him, to be such.
10 Contra verbosos, noli contendere verbis: Eccle, 10. 4 Ecclus. 8. 3.

Sermo datur cunctis: Animi sapientia Paucis.
10 Strive not in words, with men whose words are many:
All men can speak, but wisely speak, skarce any.
Or thus,
10 Words against wordy men, thou must not use:
That Is their own weapon; thou must wisdom choose.
Or thus,
10 Strive not, of talking men, the day to get:
Least it be said; Two Parrats are well met.
Or thus,
10 To strive to put down, men of words, is vain:
For Most have Tongue at will; but Few have Brain.
Or thus,
10 To make men hold their Tongues, would do them wrong
Most men would be no men, but for their Tongue.
Or thus,
10 To strive in words, with men of words, Despise:
A victory of words, sits not the wise.
11 Dilige sic alios, vtsis tibi carus ^micus. Pro. 9. 11. Eccles. 9. 12. 1. 2.
and 29. 20. and 14. 11.

Sic bonus est^ bonis, ne te mala damna sequantur.
11 Love others so, thou love thy self still most:
Be good to good men; but not to thy Cost.
Or thus,
11 Others love is the Bye; thy own the Maine:
Put not thy self to loss for others gain.
Or thus,
11 Love thy self without stint; others, in measure:
Take care, thou take no hurt, for no man's pleasure.
Or thus,
11 To all, be loving; but of none, be fond:
Be not so Free, to bring thy self in Bond.
Or thus,
11 Loves Bonds thou must embrace; other Bonds ^^ee;
Be not so Free, as not to keep thee free.
Or thus,
11 Love first thy self: let others love be last:
Where wit is Herald; so will love be placed.
Or thus,
11 The Account between thy friends and thee, so cast:
Thou Feast not them, and bring thy self to Fast,
Or thus,
11 Thy own turn served, let others Dole come after:
Be not so frank; to make thy self a laughter.
Or thus,
11 Be friend to others; but thy own friend, first:
The kind Fool, of all kinds of Fools, is worst.
12 Rumores fuge; ne incipias novus Author haberi:
Non ulli tacuisse, nocet; Nocet esse locutum. Pro. 13. 3. Eccle. 9. 19. 7. 10.
and 41. 23.

12 Spread no reports; least thou be Author thought:
By silence, None; by speech, much hurt is caught.
Or thus,
12 Spread no Reports, least thou, for Author run:
Silence, has none; Speech, many has undone.
Or thus.
12 Spread no Reports, least thou be charged withal:
Silence goes safely; Speech, makes many fall.
Or thus,
12 Spread no Reports; least they spread thee again;
Speaking turns often to the speakers pain.
Or thus,
12 Let not thy Tongue, speak all thine Ears do hear;
Least, thou may chance, to buy thy speaking dear.
Or thus.
12 Be not the brickewall, of words that may fright:
Thou see, from whence they come; not where, they light.
Or thus,
12 Spread no Reports, left thou be thought to make them:
Thou know not how, Interpreters may take them.
Or thus,
12 Spread no Reports, what ever thy words are:
No Text so clear; but that a Gloss may mar.
Or thus:
12 Spread no Reports; Do not thy words expose:
To Descanting of men; perhaps thy foes.
Or thus,
12 Spread no Reports; thou know not Fames increase:
The safest hold, is for to hold ones peace.
13 Spem tibi promissi certam promittere noli:
Rara fides ideo est, quia mults multa loquuntur. Eccle. 9. 1^^ 11.

13 On no man's Promise, build thy expectation:
For Faith is rare; and words are but a Fashion.
Or thus,
13 Upon men's words, grow not straight confident:
To give good words, is but a complement.
Or thus,
13 Think not a thing straight done, when men profess:
Men promise fair, when they mean nothing less,
Or thus,
13 Rely not on men's words: words are but wind:
And come but from the lips, not from the mind.
Or thus,
13 You Will find men's promises, but flender cheer:
Faith is flowne hence: only her Tongue left here.
Or thus,
13 Think Accidents without substances; and then
You have the right stamp, of the words of men.
14 Quum te aliquis laudat, ^udex tuus esse memento;
Plus aliis de te, quam tu tibi credere noli.
14 When thou art praisd; be Judge thy self thereto:
Thou better know thy self, than others do.
Or thus.
14 Take not men's praises of thee, as thy Due:
Unless thy own Heart, know them to be true.
Or thus.
14 When any praise thee; Judge if it be just:
And do not take men's praises up on trust.
Or thus,
14 When men praise thee; do thou Judge them; and show:
Whether, They, Thee, or Thou, Them better know.
15 Officium alterius, multis narrare memento:
Atqui aliis quum tu benefeceris, Ipse sileto.
15 Others good turns to thee, Divulge to many:
But thy good turns to others; not to any.
Or thus,
15 When others show thee kindness; let all know it:
But when thou shewst to others; never show it;
16 Muliorum quum facta senex, and dicta recenses: Eccles, 9. 19. 8.

Fac tibi succurrant, iuvenis quae feceris ipse.
16 When old, thou Censurest the deeds of men:
Remember, what being young, thy self did then.
Or thus,
16 When thou art old; censure not young men's Act^:
But call to mind first, thy own youths defects.
Or thus,
16 Judge not of young men's words and deeds, before
Thou have examinde well, thy own youths skore.
Or thus,
16 When thou will be a Censor of men's carriage:
Look first, now much thy own is in arrerage:
Or thus,
16 Make this thy Rule, in judging young men's way:
What thy own way was, when thou were as They.
17 Ne cures si quistacito sermon loquatur: Eccles. 9. 21, 24, 28.

Conscius ipse sibi de se putat omina dici.
17 When men be whispering softly; Never care:
They think all said of them that guilty are.
Or thus.
17 Whether men talk a loud; or soft and still:
What is it to thee; if thou have done no Ill.
Or thus,
17 Who doubt men's whispering talk; show themselves vicious:
It Is guilcinesse of mind, makes men suspicious.
Or thus,
17 Care not, what men between them whispering be:
So long as Conscience whispers not to thee.
18 Quum fueris faelix, qua sunt adversa Caueto: Pro 20 21. and 27, 23, 24
Eccle. 9. 18. 25.

Non eodem cursu, respondent vltima Primis.
18 When thou art at the best; then fear the worst:
The last times always, answer not the first.
Or thus.
18 In thy prosperity; take heed of Crosses:
A life begun in Gaynes, ends often in losses.
Or thus,
18 When skies are clear, take heed of Overcast:
Our life like wine, has all the Lees at last.
Or thus,
18 When Dice run fair, take heed of casting out:
The wheel of Fortune, brings the worst about.
Or thus.
18 In times of store, for times of want provide:
There Is Flud: and then an Ebb in every Tide,
Or thus,
18 In Fortunes Bliss, take heed of Fortunes Curse:
The Elder that she grows, she grows the worse.
Or thus,
18 In present calmes, to future storms attend:
Fortune, like cloth, has always a Fagend.
19 Quum dubia and fragilis nobis sit vita tributa:
In morte alterius, spem tu tibi ponere noli.
19 Since thou art sure to Dye, thou know not when:
Put not thy hope, in death of other men.
Or thus,
19 Since all are mortal; what more vain can be
Then hope to bury them, may bury thee.
Or thus,
19 Since God a frail, uncertain life does give thee:
Hope not on dead men's shoes, that may out live thee.
Or thus,
19 Why should we hope, of being others Heirs?
Does not our own sand run, as fast as Theirs?
Or thus,
19 Since in us all, Life has a doubtful scope:
To hope for dead men's Goods, is dead men's Hope.
Or thus,
19 What contract can thou make with Death; that He
Should serve his writs on others, and spare thee?
Or thus,
19 It is not Hope, but wan hope to surmize:
That thou shall live, to close another eyes.
Or thus,
19 Since all our lives, are brittle Glass and weak,
What reason thine should hold; and others break?
Or thus,
19 Why should thou think, t'out live them that be old:
Though thou art young? Does death a scantling hold?
Or thus,
19 Think not thy self from Death the more at rest
For being young; it is green fruit, Death loves best.
Or thus,
19 Think not, that life's a fruit, not fit to gather
But when it is ripe: Death likes it unripe rather.
Or thus,
19 Life's fruit is tender; seldom comes to good:
Death is a Frost in May; nips it in the Bud.
Or thus,
19 The lives of men seem in two seas to swim:
Death comes to young folks: and old, go to him.
Or thus,
19 Which may we count, to death the greater haster,
The old, has less to go: the young, runs faster.
Or thus,
19 No certain time, is set to be life's border;
Death takes away by lot, and not by order.
Or thus,
19 Old folks so ghastly are; and look so grimme:
That death fears them, as much as they fear him.
Or thus,
19 To think, t'out live thy youngers, midnesse were^
Thine Elders, Folly; therefore Both forbear.
20 Exiguum munus, quum dat tibi pauper amicus. Eccles 9. 4. 8.

Accipito placide; plene and laud^re memento.
20 When a poor friend, a small gift gives to thee:
Take it in worth: and let it praised be.
Or thus,
20 When a poor friend presents thee some small toye:
Show thy acceptance by some show of joy.
Or thus,
20 When a poor friend, for some small thing makes shift:
Look on the Givers mind, not on the Gift.
21 Infantem nudum, quum ie Natu^a crearit:
Paupertat is onus, patienter far memento.
21 Since Infants, bare and naked, borne we were:
Let us our Poverty, with patience bear.
Or thus.
21 Even nature teaches, Poverty to bear:
Since bare, and naked, made by her we were.
Or thus,
21 What child, that is good; would skorn his Mothers blessing
Then skorn not bareness, which is Natures dressing.
Or thus,
21 She that gave Life gave Bareness; Is sh'a Mother,
In giving life? A stepdame, in the other,
Or thus,
21 Since Poverty is Natures Gift: and Gifts
Of Nature, All are good: why seek we shifts?
Or thus,
21 Bareness and Poverty; are of Natures giving,
In Birth and Death; and why not then, in living?
Or thus,
21 Nature that is simple; why would thou have mixed?
Poor, first and last; and why not Poor betwixt?
Or thus.
21 Richmen, and Poor; what difference between them?
All Borne; All dead, alike; the rest, a Dream.
Or thus,
21 We came into the world, without a clout:
And in as poor a pickle we go out.
Where life's both Ends, are in so mean degree:
What matter is it; how mean the middle be.
Or thus,
21 We came into the Word, without a robe:
And we go out again, as poor as Job:
If Earth unto us, should a heaven prove;
How could we look, to have a Heaven, above.
Or thus,
21 Since Nature made us poor: lets patient be:
She better knows, what is good for us, then we.
22 Ne time as illam, quae vitae est vltima finis:
Qui Mortem metuit, quod Vivit, perdit idipsum. Eccle. 9. 14. 1^, 17, 18

22 Fear not that End of life, which Nature gives:
He that fears Death; loses, even that he lives.
Or thus.
22 Fear not that End of life, which is the last;
The fear of Death, puts Life's mouth out of taste.
Or thus,
22 Do not thy mind to frightfull fancies give?
To live, still fearing Death, is not to live.
Or thus,
22 Betimes think on thy last End; and be steady:
He that fears Dying, is half dead already.
Or thus,
22 Fear not least Death, should thee of life deprive:
Such Fear, puts life, into her Grave alive.
Or thus,
22 Fear not the hour, that life shall lose her light:
Where such Fear is, she never has but night.
Or thus.
22 Fear not life's last; each day Death cuts our skore;
And yet not Felt: the last, will do no more.
Or thus,
22 Fear not the time, that life shall end her task:
The Fear of Dying is Deaths Antimaske.
Or thus,
22 What cause have we, at Death to take offense?
If Feel, we live still: if not live, No Sense.
Or thus,
22 As good to fall; as still to fear we were;
Fear is as deadly, as the Fall we fear.
Or thus,
22 Fear not life's End; to fear, that Dye we shall,
Makes life a Death; and so, no life at all.
Or thus,
22 Fear is it self a Death; then Death comes on:
And makes Two Deaths, where we might escape with one
Or thus,
22 What day is lived, but that, to death we give?
Who therefore, would not Die; He must not live.
Or thus,

16 What can to Praise or Blame thy self, releeve thee;
If Blame, who cares? If Praise, who will believe thee?
Or thus,
16 Make not thy own Praise, or Dispraise, thy story:
The One is Folly: The Other, is Vaineglory.
Or thus,
16 Praise not, nor Blame thy self; though thou art able.

18 Wisdom is like the sun; shines when she list:
And when she pleases, hides her in a Mist.

26 Neglect of Opportunity, is a Vice:
Of which you cannot be an Actor twice.

Once gone before, nere look to overtake it.

28 To strengthen Health, Eat often in sparing measure:
We owe more to our Health, then to our Pleasure.
Or thus.
28 Eat sometimes less, thy Health may be the more:
For we are more on Healths, then Pleasures skore.
Or thus.
28 Forbear meat sometimes, though thy stomach crave it:
For Pleasure must give place, if Health will have it.
Or thus,
28 Eat sometimes sparing, thou may healthful live:
We take from Health, what we to Pleasure give.
Or thus,
28 If thou shall eat to please; not to make strong:
Thou shall have neither strength, nor Pleasure long.
Or thus,
28 We eat to make us strong; and yet the longer,
We spare to eat sometimes, we grow the stronger.
Or thus,
28 Be temperate in thy meat, and thou shall find:
Thy Body more disposd, more light thy mind.
Or thus,
28 Eat not to please: but what for Health is best:
Pleasure is but a wayter: Health's the Guest.
Or thus,
28 To change for Pleasure Health, is no good Boot:
Pleasure is but a Leaf; Health is the Root.
Or thus:
28 Let Health be steward of thy meat, not pleasure;
Health's a good Husband: Pleasure has no measure.
Or thus,
28 Pleasure and Health, in the Bodies Common wealth,
Are several Factions; Facting Holds with Health.
Or thus,
28 Fasting sometimes saves a Physicians Fee:
Yet Physic ministers as good as He.

28 Some physic is to cure: some to prevent:
But Fasting serves, both this and that intent.

28 Hard Commons make sound sheep; your fattest pasture
May sooner feed them; but they Rot the faster.
Or thus,
28 A temperate Diet, is Healths chief preserving:
Luxuriant Feeding, is as Bad as sterving.
Or thus,
28 Rich men of poor, this one advantage get:
That they may kill themselves, with better meat.
Or thus,
28 To fill thy stomach always, is not best:
To fast sometimes, is to make Health a feast.

1 Furnish thy mind with Arts: Cease not to learn:
Without which (...) can life from death discerne^
Or thus,
1 To fill thy mind with Precepts, labor most;
For without learning, life i^ but deaths Ghost.
Or thus,
1 Learning, above all other treas ^^es set:
Without which, life is but Deaths counterfeit.
Or thus,
1 Learn still, and with it let thy mind be fed,
For without learning life it self is dead.
Or thus,
1 What good do eyes, if it be always Night?
No more does life, if learning give not light.
Or thus,
1 Let Learning be thy light: Knowledge thy mark:
Or else the mind but wanders in the dark.
Or thus,
1 Body by Soul; and Soul by Learning lives:
That Life without this life, small comfort gives.
Or thus,
1 Learning is Life's Perfume, and ornament:
without which, Life has but a dismal sent.
Or thus,
1 Learn still^ for without learning no man can
Be more, then the Anatomy of a man.
Or thus,
1 Learn still: and thou shall come to plain discerning:
That Life is but Deaths Image, without learning.
2 Fortunae Donis semper parere memento:

2 When Fortune, does her worst; thou best may be;
And may shame Fortune, more then Fortune thee.

2 Fortune with all her Gifts, and gaudy self:
Can give no better Name, then sh'hath herself.
3 Quum recte Vivas, ne cures verba malorum:

3 When thou livst well; care not for lewd men's chat:
It Is more then we can do, to hinder that.
Or thus.
3 Live well; and never care, what men be talking:
It Is not in us, to keep men's Tongues from walking.
Or thus,
3 Look to thy Life; and care not for men's talk:
For, do the best thou can, lewd Tongues will walk.
Or thus,
3 Care what thou do; care not, what is said of thee:
Virtue it self, is not from slander free.
Or thus,
3 Balance thy self; weigh not men's wrongful nips:
No worth of ours, can soder up lewd lips.
Or thus,
3 When thou liv'st well; care not though men speak ill;
Our lives we can, we cannot Rule their will.
Or thus,
3 Some men speak ill; not to give men their Dues:
But they speak ill, because they cannot choose.
Or thus,
3 When thou liv'st well; of men's words make no matter:
Do not Dogs bark at Moone-shine in the water?
Or Thus,
Be nere so mild, yet some will call thee cruel,
Lewd Tongues are Fires that burn, and have no Fuel.
Or thus,
3 No worth of thine, can set Tongues such a stint:
But some will speak, as some men look a squint.

6 Fly Sloth; which is a seeming loath to live;
Body and Mind, no mutual comfort give.

6 Fly Sloth, which is a Calm worse then a storm;
And does our leaking ship of life more harm.
Or thus,
6 Fly sloth; which is to life an irksome Guest,
it take so much Rest, that it takes no rest.
Or thus,
6 Fly Sloth; which Body pines; and Mind be ^^^mes:
It is a taste of Death, before Death comes.
Or thus.
6 In drowsy men, what differs life from Death,
More than for (salt to keep them sweet) their Breath?
7 Interpone tuis, interdum gaudia curis;
Vt possis anim^ quemvis sufferre lab^rem.
7 Mix with thy Studies sometimes Recreation:
That so the spirits may have relaxation.
Or thus,
7 Thou must not always work; nor always Play:
This, That a breathing gives; That, this a stay.
Or thus,
7 Care spends the spirits: if it always spend,
And no supply by mirth; 'twill soon have end.
Or thus,
7 Mirth after Care, is the Minds Holyday:
It in^ermi^eth Care, that care it may.
Or thus,
7 The Mind is as a Bow; if This still bent:
If That still Caring; both grow impotent.
Or thus,
7 Not Mirth, nor Care alone; but enter wreathed:
Care gets Mirth; stomach: Mirth makes Care long breathed
Or thus.
7 Not Care, nor Mirth alone, but both by turns:
The mind, without Care rusts; without Mirth, mourns.

Then Patience has a Field more, to walk in.
Or thus.
12 If Fortune be grown pinching in her wrath:
Then cut thy co^, according to thy cloth.
Or thus,

Yet patience has a back will bear them all.
Or thus,
12 The Burden of Misfortune, never fear:
No Burden's great, that patience helps to bear.
Or thus.
12 At loss of worldly Goods, never look pale:
It is but a high wind, turned to a Gale.
Or thus.
12 Why should the change of Fortune, make thee pale:
Thou do but leave the Hill, to walk in the Vale.
Or thus,
12 If Fortune, of her Ankers, have thee rid,
Patience can make an Anchor of a thridde.

To turn in at the Sign of Labor in vain.
Or thus,

Thou prove thy self a bragging Mountibanke.
Or thus,
15 Strive not above thy strength: least thou be glad
To take such Pay as Babell's Workmen had.

Least, for concealing, thou as bad be thought.
Or thus,
16 Conceal not what thou justly do mislike:
Least thou be thought, as like to do the like.
Or thus,
16 Silence consents: it is therefore necessity
To tell men's faults, least thou be Accessory.
Or thus,
16 Conceal not what thou know ill done: Concealing
In Acts Fellonious, is as bad as stealing.
Or thus,
16 Conceal not men's ill doings: least men Read
Thy Will as wicked as the others Deed.
Or thus,
16 Silence may make an Innocent be guilty;
If it conceal men's doings, that are filthy,

It is the Laws own suit, to be set right.
Or thus,
17 Appeal thou to the Judge: from the Laws spite:
For even the laws themselves appeal to right.
Or thus,
17 Fly to the Judge, when thou art wronged by law:
For even Law must it self, be kept in awe.
Or thus,
17 When Law would strike, the Judge may be a shield:
The Dumb Law, to the speaking Law tnust yield.
Or thus,
17 When Laws do freeze, the Judges Hearts may thaw:
And Judges are a Law, even to the Law.
Or thus.
17 When Laws are harsh; the Judges must be mild:
Else, all Humanity will be Exiled.
Or thus,
17 No Law can be a Rule, so straight and just:
But it may Rule awry; If Judges list.

19 Read much, and much read; Read much more; In brief:
Poets are all for wonder, not belief.
Or thus,
19 Read much; and much read; Read it again: Indeed
Poets speak strange things, but not always Creed.
Or thus,
19 Read more and more: and still Read more: and know,
Poets tell wonders, but not Gospel though.
Or thus,

Though Poets tell thee wonders, Do not swear it.

Poets tell Tales, are neither Truths nor lies.

Nam struit infidias lachrymis, quum faemina plorat.
21 Let not the Angry words of thy wife fray thee;
It Is when a woman weeps, she means to pay thee.
Or thus,
21 Fear not thy wifes hot words: it is woman's guise:
Plain, when she plaigues; deceitful, when she cries.
22 Vtere quaesitis, sed ne vide aris abuti:
Qui sua consu^unt, quum D^st, aliena sequuntur.
22 Abuse not thy Estate, with riotous dealing:
For, Riot wounds with want; want cures with stealing.
Or thus,
22 Use thy Estate; but Fool it not away:

22 Use; but with temper: that which thou have got:
No Leech like One, that had; and has it not.
Or thus,
22 Use that thou have; but Use it with discretion:
Evacuation's mad, for new Repletion.
Or thus,
22 Use thy Estate; but give it not the slip:
Want makes the Old wife tro^t, the Young wife trippe.

22 Be not prof^se in spending: when all fails,
Men live not by their hands, but by their Nails.
Or thus,

23 Resolve; of Death, no fear is to be had:
Which, though not good; yet Ends all that is bad.
Or thus,
23 Where Death is feared; it seems not understood:
Is not the End of Evils, a Joyful Good?

23 Be not afraid of Dying: have not thou
Good Cause to welcome that, brings th'Olive bough?
Or thus,
23 Who would fear Death? which though an End it be:
Yet not of Us, but of our Misery.
Or thus,
23 Soul brought a Bed of Body, and Delivered,
Is Death: Is not he, that fears this, white liverd?
Or thus,
23 Death is an End, These following follow Cato, but go a Christian step
be^ond him.
and a Beginning too:
As that; not ill: as this; a thing we woe.
Or thus,
23 This one thing were enough to raise deaths price:
That, there is no way but it, to Paradise.
Or thus,
23 These Goods are only in Deaths Cabin kept;
All weeping, left: all weeping past, unwept.
Or thus,

To make thy life a Grave; thy Grave a life.

1 Scorn Riches, if to happiness thou aspire:
Who Riches love, are Beggars in Desire.
Or thus.
1 Scorn Riches; if a fair life thou desire;
Moneys admirers, live but in the mire.
Or thus,
1 This were enough, to prove Riches accursed;
If nothing else: They make men still athirst;
Or thus,
1 Happy, who riches from his Heart removes;
And wanting, needs them not; nor Having, loves.
Or thus.
1 Who would Imagine, rich men Beggars were?
Yet so they are, still craving; still in fear.
Or thus.
1 It need no riddle be, whereat to stagger:
A man may be a Richman; Yet a beggar.
Or thus,
1 Riches consist not, in the having store:
But in the having no desire to more.
Or thus,
1 Beggary consists not, in an empty chest;
But in an empty mind, that cannot rest.
Or thus,
1 To be an Actual Beggar, is a curse:
Yet the Habitual beggar, is the worse.
Or thus,
1 The Actual beggar, may be helped by having:
Th'Habituall cannot: still more had, more craving.
Or thus,
1 The Actual beggar, does but want at worst:
Th'Habituall wants it more; because more thirst;
Or thus,
1 A beggar wants but that, which he has not;
But rich men want, even that which they have got.
Or thus,
1 A beggar has much pain, a rich man more:
He, but of want: They, both of want, and store.
Or thus,
1 If happiness thou love, then love not Riches,
For such men's minds, are never without stitches.
Or thus,
1 Our bodies turn to earth, if Death arrive:
Because we turn our minds, to earth; alive.

Thou would not be content; If thou had more:
Or thus,
2 Little is store to one content: and store,
Is little to him, that still longs for more.
Or thus,
2 Nature gives all men, a sufficient lot:
But they run after Toys, and so it not.

Accuse not Fortunes blindness, but thine own.
Or thus,
4 Accuse not Fortune, if thy state decline:
Fortune is not too blame, the fault is thine.
Or thus,
4 It Is blindness, to think Fortune blind, and not
That we are blind, when we have blind men's lot.
Or thus,
4 What we call Fortune, is not hap, or chance:
But good our care: Bad, our misgovernance.
Or thus,
4 Fortune's no word of Cause, but of Event:
The cause our selves; then let our selves be shent.
Or thus,
4 Fortune, Adverse or prosperous, never call;
Upon our own legs, we must Rise or Fall.
Or thus,
4 Fortune, thy state can neither make, nor mar:
Our selves the Forgers of our Fortunes are.
Or thus,
4 Events successful, or Adverse betide us:
As we have clear, or dimmer Eyes to guide us.
Or thus,
4 Fortune is never blind, if thou have Eyes:
Nor ever sees, but when thy self art wise.

And then as well, may cast away his bow.
Or thus,
7 Who the Philosophers stone, 'to make, assay:

A spark not looked to, may set House a fire.

Then do according; and then thou art wise.

Fly Gluttony, which is the Bellies friend.
Or thus,
10 When thou art taken, with lusts banefull pleasure,
Pamper not up thy Flesh; which knows no measure.
Or thus,
10 The acts of Venery, and Gluttonizing:
Are acts that have a certain sympathizing.

10 When thou intendest Venus wanton play:
Fly Gluttony, which looks another way.
Or thus.
10 The Acts of Venus, Lust and Gluttony:
Are acts that have a plain Antipathy.
11 Quum tibi proponas animalia cuncta timere:

11 Find cause to fear all Beasts you easily can:
But I advise you more, to fear one Man.

12 Strength's Valors hand; Wisdom his Eye; 'twere shame
That Valor should be either Blind or lame.
Or thus,
12 Bodily Strength, and wisdom of the Mind:
Where both these meet, there valor is in Kind.

15 To take thy mark; a faithful friend to find.
Aim not at wealth; but at the life and mind.
Or thus,
15 In choosing of a Friend, observe but this:
Regard not what he has, but what he is.
Or thus,
15 Choose Friends, as if a choosing sheep you were:
Look to their soundness, not what wool they bear.
Or thus,
15 Thou must to goodness, not to Goods attend:
Or else thou may have friends, but not a Friend.
Or thus,
15 A faithful friend is best known by this mark:
He Is less discerned in the light than in the dark.
Or thus,
15 When thou would find a Friend to stick unto:
Not Mannours make the man, but manners do.
Or thus,
15 Never make doubt, what Friendship should be got:
Wealth makes a Bowt; but Virtue ties the Knot.
Or thus,
15 A faithful Friend is hard to light upon:
All the rich men that are, can scarce make One.
Or thus,
15 Where may we go, to find a faithful Friend?
Whither? but to Vtopia, or worlds End.
Or thus,
15 If thou would find a Friend sincere and Simple:
Look him not at the Exchange, but at the Temple.
Or thus,
15 If thou would find a Friend without disguise:
Look not amongst the Wealthy, but the wise.
Or thus,
15 To know a Friend, that is more in Heart, than Lips:
Mark him not in the Sun, but in the Eclips.
Or thus,
15 Friendship and Wealth, have several works to do.
Friendship makes two, One; and Wealth makes One, two.
Or thus,
15 Friendship and Wealth, stay never long together:
Wealth only fair: Friendship likes any weather.
Or thus,
15 What Friendship joys in, that makes wealth to groan:
Friendship will have a partner, wealth will none.
Or thus,
15 A Real friend a Cannon cannot batter:
With Nom'nall friends; a squib's a per'lous matter.
Or thus,
15 This one mishap, all other far exceeds:
That we still trust to friends, Egyptian Reeds.

Or thus.
16 Use that thou have, and long not after more:
What good does store, if only kept in store?
Or thus:
16 Use thy Estate, what art thou else the better?
What good do Feet, if always in a setter?
Or thus^
16 Use that thou have, and be no Miser thought:
To have and want, is greater curse than fault.
Or thus,
16 A Misers Tenure has a double curse:
Active, it has much ill; Passive much worse.
Or thus,
16 A Misers reckoning has a double score:
He does much ill, and yet he suffers more
Or thus,
16 To have, and use it, are two several Dowres:
Either we must have both: or neither's ours.
Or thus,
16 To want, and not to have it, is a curse:
But yet to have it, and not use it, worse.
Or thus.
16 Not having, but the using makes men wiser:
Not wanting; but not using, makes a Miser.
Or thus.
16 Use that thou have, it is great skill to be able:
To read how Miser, may spell miserable.

17 If in true Honor thou desire to Shine:
Then all false Joies of life, thou must Decline.
Or thus,
17 If in the course of Honor thou would Run:
Thou must vain sports, and all false pleasures Shun.
Or thus,
17 A good Name, is a sad and sollid Treasure:
And Runs from all them, that run after Pleasure.
Or thus,
17 A good Name is the Prize of Earthly Races:
But is not got with running Wilde-goose Chaces.

To mock an Old man, is to mock a Child.
Or thus,
18 Laugh not at those defects which Old age sends:
In Childhood, life began; in Childhood ends.
Or thus,
18 When thou art young, mock not Old folks decay:
They were as Thou; and Thou shall be as They.
Or thus,
18 Who would mock Children? and Old folks are more:
Twice Children, They; Once now; and once before.
Or Thus,
18 Nature by Age, seems to raise childhoods price:
Which, other Ages once, makes Childhood twice.
Or thus,
18 Childhood so harmless is: Middle Age so vain:
That Nature makes Old age turn Child again.
Or thus,
18 Who scoff at Age, scoff at their own Desire:
For who that lives, but does to Age aspire.
Or thus,
18 Let him that mockes Old age, this Doom sustain:
Either die Young; or Old, be cracked in's brain.

Yet Art is as thy Heart that never leaves thee.

19 Get Learning, for when outward things decay:
Yet Art is neither Times nor Fortunes prey.
Or thus,
19 All other things, like Flowers, are fading seen:
Learning is like the Laurel, always green.
Or thus,
19 Get Knowledge: Fortune takes what Fortune gives:
Knowledge alone, in spite of Fortune lives.
Or thus,
19 Get Knowledge, other things a man may lose:
Knowledge is that, which once come, never goes.
Or thus,
19 Get Learning; other things are seas'd on daily:
Art only's priviledg'd; and fears no Baily.
Or thus,
19 Get Knowledge, other things are but as Leases:
Art only is in Fee, and never ceases.
Or thus,
19 Learn something: Wealth is of a casual quality:
Art only has a certain Immortality.

20 To mark carefully men's speech: Speech is a star:
Both hides and shows, what men's Conditions are.

Or thus,
22 Care not, what time, Death shall dissolve this slime,
He that scorns life, can die at any time.
Or thus,
22 Care not what time, thy time of dying is,
To one prepared, no time can come amiss.
Or thus,
22 What matter is it, when or bow thou dyest?
Life's not so goodly, when it is at highest.

22 What Is life, that in it, we should place our joys?
We eat, drink, talk, walk, laugh, and all but toies.

Or thus,
24 Drink not extremely if thou love thine ease:
Every Extreme breeds some extreme Disease.
Or thus,
24 Drink what thou can well bear: surfets to some,
As well by drinking, as by eating come.
Or thus,
24 Drink moderately; if health thou will maintain:
Excess of pleasure breeds excess of pain.
Or thus,
24 Think not, to break thy head, with Drink is good:
For, though it bleeds not, yet it teints the blood.
Or thus,
24 Drink serves the Bodies moisture to maintain:
When that turn's se^v'd; the rest but drowns the brain.
Or thus,
24 Thy brains would shine, if washing every day,
Did wash them clean; not wash them clean away.
Or thus.
24 Drink, but in temper: Pleasure without measure,
Brings thee at last, to measure without pleasure?
Or thus^
24 Drink not too much: what man that were not vain
Would broach his mouth, to set a tylt his brain?
Or thus,
24 Drink what thou c^^st well bear: for more then that
Brings present madness; future, God knows what.
Or thus,
24 Drink not too much: such Drinking will in Fine,
Have a worse skore, then paying for the wine.
25 La^d iris quodcunque palam; quodcunque probaris:
Hoc vide, Ecclus. 5. 10.
ne rursum (...) crimine damnes.
25 Dispraise not that, which thou had praised before:
Least thou for lightness, be dispraised more.
Or thus.
25 Seem not to have two Tongues within your Head:
By Contradicting, what before you said.
Or thus,
25 Be not a weather cock, to change thy mind,
In praising, and Dispraising with the wind.
Or thus,
25 To praise a thing at one ti^^e, and another
To vilify the same; is lightness Feather.
Or thus,
25 To Praise a thing; and dispraise it again:
Is, with the Tongue, to play lege^demain.
Or thus,
25 First to extol; then vilify again
Shows both a gadding tongue; and giddy Brain.
26 Tranquillis rebus, Job. 24. 24.
semper quae adversa cavate:
Rursim in adversis, ^elius sperare memento.
26 In calmy times, take heed of storms may rise:
In stormy times, hope well, for calmer skies.
Or thus.
26 Since Fortune of her wheel, is still a turning,
Grief, well may hope for joy, and joy fear mourning.
Or thus,
26 On Fortunes lightness, set thou up thy rest,
In wealth, to fear: in want, to hope the best.
Or thus,
26 Nature, for two estates, has given two passions,
Hope, for dejectings; fear for exaltations.
Or thus,
26 Wealths Arms is fear: Wants, Hope: so want is best,
In better Arms; though wealth, in better Crest.
Or thus,
26 When Fortune smiles, doubt it to be but hollow,
And when she frowns, doubt not but smiles will follow.
Or thus,
26 Thou may give Fortune leave, to frown a while,
For having ^rown'd; she will turn about, and smile.
27 Discere necesses, Job 32. 9.
cuta sapie^^i^ crescit,
Ra^^ d^tur longo Prudentia temporis usu.
27 Cease not to learn from this does wise ^ome rise,
Time without learning, seldo ne makes men wise.
Or thus,
27 Cease not to learn: wisdom by care does climb,
He knows not much, that is taught by only time,
Or in a contrary sense:
27 Cease not to learn: wisdom by care does climb,
And then grows rare, when it is taught by time.
Or thus,
27 Cease not to learn: that is wisdoms first degree:
Add time to it, and then, 'twill perfect be.
28 Parce laudato; Ecclus. 6. 7. 8, 9.
nam quem tu sape probaris,
Vna dies, qualis fuerit, oftendet amicus.
28 Praise not too fast; for, whom thou often have praised,
One hour will show, on what weak ground it was raised.
Or thus,
28 Be spare in setting a Friends praises forth,
For, till the try all day, all is nothing worth,
Or thus,
28 Praise not a friend too much: only one day,
Will tell more of him, then all you can say.
Or thus,
28 Praise not too fast, thy praise may chance to run,
Where thy friends worth, will scarce come creeping o^.
Or thus,
28 Praise not a friend too much: least if you pay^
His wages before hand; he run away.
Or thus,
28 Praise not a friend too fast; it is not tho^,
But time and proof, that must his praise allow.
Or thus.
28 Praise not a friend too much: a sadder wound
May come by praises lost, then friend not found.
Or thus,
28 Praise not too much; left thou be forced in the end:
To eat thy words, and vomit up thy friend.
Or thus,
28 Praise not a friend, upon bare intimation:
There Is more belongs to proof, then protestation.
Or thus,
28 Make no post haste, to put friends in thy Creed.
Many are friends in show, but Few in Deed.
Or thus,
28 You cannot count one happy, till he die:
You must not count a Fri^^nd until you try.
29 Ne pudeat quae nescieris, Ecclus. 21 12.
te velle d^c^ri:
Scire aliquid, laus est; culpa est, Nil discere velle.
29 What thou know not, think no shame to be taught:
To know, is praise: no will to learn, the Fault.
Or thus,
29 What thou know not, be willing to be taught:
The will to learn, makes Ignorance (...) fault.

Qua flu^non platidum est, for san latet ^ltius ^nda.
31 Offilent, solemn, sullen men beware:
The stream runs smooth, where deepest waters are.
Or thus;
31 When you see men, that words and looks can keep,
The stream tells what they are; more smooth, more deep.
Or thus,
31 The stream runs smooth where deep; and such is one,
That says not much, and looks like Friar John.
Or thus;
31 Look to such men, as look deject and still:
The still Sow always eats up all the ^will.
32 Quum tibi displiceat rerum Fortuna tuarum:
Alterius specta, quo sis discrimine prior.
32 When thy own Fortune, seems to thee a curse,
Mark others; see, what numbers there are worse.
Or Thus,
32 Why should thou grieve, or think thy own case strange,
When most are such, with whom thou woulst not chang^?
Or thus,
32 If Fortune now give thee not thy content,
Were thou, as some are; how should she be shent?
Or thus,
32 When thou conceivest, Fortune does beshrow thee:
Think, in what case are others, far below thee.
Or thus,
32 Think when thou envy'st others, thy superiors:
How many envy thee, that are inferiors.
Or thus
32 What needs the Moon with envy look so pale?
She Is great to stars, though to the sun be small.
Or thus,
32 If nothing else content thee, yet this may:
The Best, have better; the worst, worse then they.
Or thus,
32 All Fortunes Odds, is by comparisons Eye,
Look up, or down; and thou art low, or high.
33 Quod potes, id tenta: nam littus carpereremis:
Tutius est multo, quam velum tendere in Altum.

Is safer far, then launch into the Deep.
Or thus.
33 To deal in things above thy reach, Refrain:
The shore is always safer, then the Maine.

33 Climb not too high; least thou endangerd be:
Low bows are strong; but weak, at top o'th Tree.
Or thus,
33 Think not thy forces, greater then they are:
Conceit is able, Able-parts to mar.
Or thus.
33 Let not presumption, work thy own deceit:
No greater Mountibanke, then self-conceit.

The cause is theirs, but the Revenge is Gods.

34 Offer no wrong to just men, though you might:
God is a god of Vengeance, in their Right.

corporis V^br^.

37 How can thou Promise to thy self long life;
Which but a thread holds; and Death holds the knife?

37 All Promises of Life, deceitful are,
Death's nearer to us, then we are aware.
Or thus,
37 While men their days of life, are multiplying:
They live not longer; but are longer Dying.

That know not, what we have, till all be spent?

Our ship most sale; we spring a leake, and sink.
Or thus,
37 This partial Error, on men's minds is grown:
They think Death, others case, but not their own.

37 We must Examples to our selves apply;
Such men did young, or sudden: why not I?
