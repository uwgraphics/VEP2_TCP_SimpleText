A ballade of the scottysshe king.


King Iamy / Iomy your. Joy is all go
ye sommn^ed our king why did ye ^o
To you no thyn^ it did accord
To sommon our king your sovereign lor^^
A king a somner it is wonder
Know ye not salt and sugar asonder
In your somnynge ye were to malaperte
And your harolde no thing expert
Ye thought ye did it full valyauntolye
But not worth three s^ppes of a pie /
Sir squire galyarde ye were to swyfte.
Your will run before your wit.
To be so scornful to your alye /
Your counseyle was not worth a fly.
Before the frensshe king / danes / and other
Ye ought to honor your lord and brother
Trow ye sir James his noble grace /
For you and your scotts would turn his face
Now ye prode scotts of gelawaye.
For your king may sing welawaye
Now must ye know our king for your regent /
Your sovereign lord and presedent /
In him is figured melchisedeche /
And ye be desolate as armeleche
He is our noble champyon.
A king anointed and ye be non
Through your counseyle your tader was slain
Wherefore I fere ye will suffer pain /
And ye proud scotts of dunbar
Parde ye be his homager.
And suitors to his parlyment /
Ye did not your dewty therein.
Wyerfore ye may it now repent
Ye bear yourselfe somewhat to bold /
The^fore ye have lost your topholde.
Ye be bound tenauntes to his estate.
Give up your game ye play chekmate.
For to the castle of norham
I vnderstoude to soon ye came.
For a prisoner there now ye be
Either to the devil or the ermite.
Thanked be saint. Gorge our ladies knythe
Your pride is paste adwe good nytht.
Ye have determined to make a fraye
Our king than being out of the way
But by the power and might of god
Ye were beten weth your own rod
By your wanton will sir at a word
Ye have lost spores / cote armure / and sword
Ye had be better to have busked to huntey bakes /
Than in England to play any such prankes
But ye had some wyle sede to sow.
Therefore ye be laid now full low /
Your power could no longer attain
War with our king to meyntayne.
Of the king of nauerne ye may take heed /
How unfortunately he does now speed /
In double wells now he does dreme.
That is a king witou a realm
At him example ye would none take.
Experyence has brought you in the same brake
Of the out yles ye rough foted scorres /
We have well eased you of the bottes
Ye row rank scotts and droken danes
Of our english bows ye have set your banes.
It is not fyttynge in tour nor town /
A somner to were a kings crown
That ^ Lion.
(...)and pride has laid a down
His sone the lord admyrall is full good.
His sword has bathed in the scotts blood
God save king. Henry and his lords all
And send the treullhe king such an other fall /
Amen / for saint charyte^ And god save noble. King / Henry / The.v^ij.
