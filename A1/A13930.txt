co^fermed for this seyth saint austyn Habe caritate^ et quicquid vis Have ye
charity and do what ye will so it Agree with charity and all shall turn to
your well / As saint Ambrose seyth after that same effect in contrary wordys
Qui non habet caritatem omne bonu^ quod habet amittit / who that has no
charity he leseth all the weles / that he has or any thing that man does
without love is not acceptable to god / and of this seyth seynte poule Si

and man And that I should do never so much penance and yield my body to the
fire to be burnt and gyf all my good to feed poor folks If I had not with
this love in god and to all folks for god all this should no thing profit /
for as seyth the holy abbot moses All the penance that we suffer and other
good works that we do or cause to be done / ne be but Instrumentis for to

not to be be loved for them self only / but for ye holy love that growyth in
the heart of man be their help and be their procreacyon and that Ihu^ criste
more sooner sends his grace and makes the heart clean and of clear sight.
which none may have that be ocupyed and ouyr corians / about worldy vanyteys

clennesse And tho folks of foul heart no clean thing belongs / For this /
ouyr all other things be coryous. to keep your heart clean in the love of our

For thus spekyth saint Austyn to our lord sayng Minus te amat q^ aliquod p^ter

shall be glorified in heuene / and not they that have led hardeste life and
lengeste penance but tho that most have loved. augustinus. Non diuturnitas

this has done jhu^ ye king of glory be your soul that is his love as does a
king of far contreys. that louyth a strange lady and sends his masse^gers
/ before with his lettyrs of love: In the same manner did our lord Ihu^ ye
sent his patryarkis and his prophetis of the old testamente with letters.
These ware the sweet prophecyes. of his gracyous coming in to earth and tha^ne
at the last he came all preuyly and brought with him ye gospels as lettyrs
opened and wreted with his precious blood. and with ye same saved he his love
to conquar her Now leth her a tale in syngnyfyaunce of the entyre love of our
sweet lord Ihu^ christ There was a lady some time in great war with her dedely
enemies yt had dystroyed the substance of all her land and she all poor was
beseged in an old castle with him round abowte and this castle was weyke
and made of full febyll matter Neuertelesse there was a rich king and of great
power yt marvelously loved her with such far neuce that often he sent his
messe^gers on to her and sent her mani fair Iowellys and good socours wherwyth
she myghth be sustained and good help of his noble meny to defend her and her
castle And she received all these thing as a vyleyne yt vnuethys cowde yield
him a gramercy for all these great welys so rude and hard was her heart how
be it had not the bounte and the pity of this noble king been she had be
utterly lost and dystroyed for he was so supprysed with her love that at ye
last he came him self to the rofe of the tour and showed her his fair visage
which was most fair of all other to behold and spoke to h^yr so sweet
wordys / and delycious yt they might have quikned a body half deed: There did he
mani marueyles / and showed great mastryes / and before her eyes preued part of
his power. and told of his rych^esse and offrid to make her queen of all yt he
hade and to gif her all his reme with this that she would gyf him her love
without more But this was in vein for her lone would she not promise him A
was not this a great abusion of this bestly wretch that was not worthy to
serve vndyr his fete / yte of his debonarite pity had so veynquysht him be
fors of love yt at ye last he seide A madam I se well ie be greatly grieved with
your enemies that be so ner you and so fers and strong that ye may in no wise
escape there handis / but they will put you to euele and sorrowful death but ye
have help / wherefore I will for your love entyrprise this bataile upon them to
dyscon^fyte your enemies how be it I know well yt I shall receive among them
full hard and dedely wou^dys but with my good will I shall take them tho win
your heart And now I pray you full petonsly weeping for the great love that I
shall show you that at the least ye will love me aftyr my peynfull death sith
in my life ye will not love me thanne in this manner entyrd this king in to this
battle and dystounfyted all her enemies / and delivered her from them that
purposed her death and was him self wounded so sore and grievously that he dyed
but by miracle roos / he frodeth to live was not this lady ouyr vnnaturell and
much to be blamed if she loved not him ouyr all other This same king is the
sweet Ihu^s yt in this manner has love to our sowles. that fendes had beseged
and he as a noble^ savior sent her many massengers and many great bounteys
done to her. and fynalle came him self for to preue his love and showed well be
cheualrye that he was / worthi to be be loved / whereof seyth saint barnarde /
Nonne dei filius cum esset (...) sinu patris a regalibus sedibus pro anima tua

not right dear friends seyth saint Barnarde that Ihu^ christ the sone of god
how that he being in the bosom of his father descended fro that ryall sete in
the heavenly empire for the love he had to your soul to deliver her fro ye
power of the fend when he hard how she was beseged and with the bondys of
sin enbrased and without taryenge should have be delivered to the fend to
the preson of hell and was condemned to pardurable death / And he be great
pity and compassyoun wept full tenderly for her in asmoche as she another cowde
weep nor help her self and yete he weep not only but offryd him self to dye
for her relefe Behold now mortal wretchys who suffrid death for your life /
this did the sweet Ihesus the king of heuene to win your love as knight
were wone to do some time he came to the tourney and for the love of his love
which is iour soul bar his shyld on all partys of the bathayle as A
valyaunte knight and A hardy His shylde that covered the godhede was his
blessed body that was spread upon the hard cross there appeared he as A shylde
in his armies with his handys streyned and persed and his feet nailed down as
sum men sey the tone upon the the other And where this shylde had no side
syngnyfyeth yt his dyscyplys that should have be shilde to his sydis / fled
all / from him as he seyth in the gospell^ Relicto eo omnes fugerunt. They be
all fled and left him all for fere of death This shylde is geuyn us for our
dyffense ayenste all euelis and all temptacon^. as saint Jerome seyth /
Dabit stictu^ cordis in laborem tuu^. Lord jhesu christ thanked be ye / ye have
geuyn us a shylde for our hertes which is ye thought of your peynfull /
travail whereof seyth saint Barnard. / Quid ta^ efficax ad curandu^ vulnera

is so spedfull to hele and purge ye spyrytuall woundys. as ententyf medytacon^
of ye sorrowful woundys of our sweet lord jhu^ christ / and david seyth with
this shylde be e^uyron^ed all they that loue^ him And serve him night and day.
Scito circu^dabit te veritas eius non timebis a timore nocturno. Ne dread we
not ye fere of ye night for this is the trowth the sone of god / enuyroundyth
us with his. shylde where sum euyr we be. and it more be his good will with his
shylde he has crowned us. as david seyth for with his good will suffyrd he all
this. as Isaee seyth. Oblatus est quia ipse voluit / Now will ye sey
paraue^ture wherefore suffyrd he these marvelous great peynes might he
nolightlyer redeem us fro hell A yis / yis might he with much les if it had
pleased him / but he would not so wherefore but to show us how much he loved us
and to gyf us ensample to love him: for such as men love little they let it
lyghtli go and if they have it not they ask not theraftyr / and also the more
pain and harm that a man suffryth for his friend the more his he to be
beloved / whereof saint bernarde seyth / Amplius michi vilis esse non debeo
quia tantum deo placuit anima mea. vt mori pro me eligeret ne me perderet. In
asmoche as the sweet jhesus was more vile in earth for me in so much is he to
me more dear in sweet love for I could not think that he had loved me so much
/ A sweet Ihu^ fro hensforth ought I not to set lyttyll be my soul syn it
was so pleysaunte to him that he chaas rather to suffyr death tha^ne lose it
Ite^ Barnardus Nisi amasset me dulciter no^ me in carcere Requisisset illa
maiestas. If ye sweet jhesu had not loved me the more feruenhly he had not come
from his high ryall majesty for me that was so low in hell In this shylde be
three things ye ton is / the wode. ye the other is the skyn. and the third is
the color This it is of the shylde that Ihu^ christ has left you The wode of
the cross the lethir of the peynfull passyo^ of our lord. And color of his
red blood / Tha^ne the skyn of his precious body was all to rent and broken
and colowred with his precious blood and the cross also The third reason of
this shylde is that aftyr the death of a valyaunte knight men should show his
shylde in the remembrance of him This shylde is the crucyfyxe that is / set
in ye church where me^ may se and think of the cheualrye that our lord jhu^
christ did on hye upon the cross / on the mount of caluarye before them of
his blessed dear sorrowful mother / This shylde is ha^gyd up in every church
yt his love which is our soul may behold how dear he has bought her / he
let not to bear his shylde and to opyn his side to show his heart and showed
all openli how entyrly he loved her and how she ought often to think of the
tokenys of love that in this shylde is: syngnyfyed / whereof seyth saint
Bernarde O felix anima aspice inclinacione^ capitis ad osculu^ / extencionem
brachioru^ ad ampbexum. O ye blessed and happy spowse of jhu^ christ behold on
the crucyfyx the shylde of jhesu christ your spowse And se the inclinacyon of
his head to kiss you / se the spredyng of his armies to clyppe you behold the
opening of his side and the crucyfyenge of his fair body and with greet
affeccyoun of your holy love turn it and return it from side to side / fro
the head to the fete and ye shall find that there was never sorou nor pain
like to that pain our lord Ihesu christ endureed for your love and seyth he
has geuyn so myche for your love and yet may not have it / It is gre marueyle
I may seyth he gyf now no more wherefore ye will love me and that forthymketh me
but when I may no forther I shall sey such thing whereof ye shall have pity
if ye will at the least be charity of great gyftys. whereof speaks saint
Barnarde. Uere compaciendu^ est ei qui dedtt nobis clauos in salsam carnem in
cibum / sanguinem in potum / aquam ex latere / in balneum sudorem sanguinis in
medicina^: and propriam animam in redempcionem. Trewly is the sweet Ihesu
christ A herttely lover and A compassyonate that has gnuyn us / so many great
specyalteys Behold how he has geuyn us / his nails in sauce. his sweet
flesh in mete / his precious blood in drink watyr of his precious side in
Baynes his blody sweet in medecyne / his propyr blessed soul in our rede^pcyon
A what may we more axe that he should gyf for us Alas / alas / full hard is
that heart and full vnnaturell that will not love him that has geuyn so much
for their loue-here is a great specialt wherefore we should love god The secunde
cause wherefore god is to be beloved more tha^ne any other thing is for the
marvelous. great love that he has showed us. ouyr all other louys. There be
four special louys: in this world ye one is. between ij good felawes The
the other between mother and child / The third between body and soul And the
fourth between man and wife But the dear love that Ihu^ christ louyth us and
also that we should love him. passes and surmounteth all other louys Men
might say that this / were a right good felaw that would lay his plegge in
place for to aquite his / felaw owte of debt and of vsurye / but the sweet
Ihu^ put him self in place and leyd his tendyr body to aquyte his love which
is our soul owte of the prison of hell and of all vsuryes whereof david seyth
Et pro vsuris et iniquitate redimit animas eoru^. From all vsuries and
ynyquiteys / he has redemeth our sowlys Take heed now who brought this
pereaunte to the place. wete ye well it was the blessed maiden our lady saint
mary that bare the sweet Ihu^. the sone of god in her vyrgynall womb in the
time of winter. and in the cite of Bethle^ for to put him in plegge to make our
pees. in the place where the angels / sunge gloryously before his* fader in

cruel Jews. that they deyned to logge this lady that bare this blessed plegge

what vilany suffered ye sweet Ihesu christ in this life in the place where he
lay so long for us / For the gospel says that when he prechid to the pepyll
for the sauacyon of their sowlys and opened to them the right way toward
heaven and when he hade ended his right sweet sermon for all his seruise ye
felon Iewis sterte on him and would have stoned him to death and then said he

that is to sey wha^ne he was with his Angels and archa^gels which were ready
for to serve him to his pleasur and now was the sweet Ihu^ in preson in this

deserte upon him self and for the great anguisshis and shamis that he suffird
folk wend that he had been a mesell A god how humble ware ye to suffyr them so
cruelly / and vengably to stryke you and for such anguysh he pleyned him to his
father in ye gospel Nunc ai^a mea turbata est et quid dicam pater saluifica me
ex hac hora sed propter hoc veni in horam hanc Now is my soul greatly troblede.
A what may I sey fair dear fader save me nethelesse her fore I came in earth to
suffyr so hard peynis to aquyte my friends and of all this made he no force if
he might have won the love / our soul for the which he suffyrd so great
sorowys and grievous pain in ye place where he was put for our love / wherefore ye
may well think for truth that yt behooves us to suffyr sum pena^nce for him
and for our sauacon^ / how beyt he has no need of us of our good dedys whereof
david says Bonoru^ meorum non indiges dn^e Fair lord seyth he ye have no no
need of my good dedys / but for all that good will not save a man if he help

Now I pray you since yowr soul is the love of Ihu^ christ the high king of
heuene that if ye may no more do for his sweet love yette at ye leeste yt ye
have often in remembrance these three manner of anguyshys that he suffryd / so
long in the place where he lay for your aquytayle / Wha^ne ye behold your
rich clothis and other fair Iewellis your great horses / and fair harneys
tha^ne bethynke you of the poor clothyng that your lord and love ihesu christ
and his dyscyplys had and how they went abowte barfote in wyntyr and in
somyr / and what dyssese they suffryd / and also often wha^ne ye sytte at ye
tabyll so rychely arayd and served and goodly Ientylme^ abowte you so well
araid and well seruinge yt serve you so no^ely with cuppys of gold and syluyr
vessel with so many and diverse / and good metys with delycyous sawses and
pleysau^t wynes / Tha^ne reme^byr you with great compascon^ how poorly the
rich king of heneue was served your spowse the sweet Ihu^s wha^ne he was so
weary for great travail and hungyr yt yt behooved him to go owte of ye cite of
samerie in ye mean time that his dyscyplys went in to ye cite to fetch bred
and in the mean whylys came a woman to fetch watyr at a well whereby he satte /
and he preyde the woman to give him of her water to drink / but she would not
but rather repreuyd him full egyrly / and he spoke ageyn so benyngly to that
woman that she was converted and than came his discyplis. And brought mete and
set them all down wythowte tabyll and without cloth / and perauentur took one
of there poor mantellys and set thereon there bred and said* Rabi ma^duca and
dixit eis. Ego cibu^ habeo ma^ducare que^ vos nescites meus cibus e^ vt facia^
volu^tate^ eius qui misit me vt perficia^ opus eius. His disciplis seide mastir
ete now and he answered I have mete to ete whereof ye know no thing a good lord
mercy yette for all ye great desir he had to ete he abode til yt was nere high
none yt he veinquisht dis desire and would sooner ete / O yt this is a great
ensample to us wha^n we have any time great desyr to any delicyous mete or
drink or any other sore temptacon^ we should fight ^^^nst our own will* But
what seyde he aftyr my mete is that I must do ye will of my fader yt is to
suffyr hungre and thirst and great anguisshys and grievous peynes / and bethynke
you also how ye poor dyscyplys ete ye erys of wh^te in ye seldis when they
went with there sweet mastyr Ihu^ christ / and of him self yt is wretyn that he
came one day in the morning and had great hungyr as he that had watched in
prayeer / and in travail and in sermonys / and saw a fygge tree full of leuys
wythowte any fruit and when he came nere yt he seyde to the fyggetre / ye shall
neuyr bear fruit without end and forth with the fygtre becam all dry behold
now fair friend how many dissesis your sweet spowse suffird for to redeem you /
Wherefore hit is good for you to think well and often on all this wahn ye be in
the dysportys of this world or when ye see other comforted in foul vanyteys /
Remenbyr you then with preuy syghynge how petowsly the sweet Ihu^s the sone
of god wept when he came riding all barfote upon A poor ass Vide^s Ihu^s
ciuitate^ fleuit super illa^ dicens qr cognouissis and tu ciuitate^ id
ecclesiam As he came and knew al this yt was to come as well to the^e yt were

and seyde if ye knew asmoche as I know ie should weep as tendirly as I do /
right as he hade seide to the^ I weep for this that ye do in folly and in vanyte

streyte is the weye that ledyth to perdurable life and few folks find hit /
Ne see ye not well that Ihu^ christ suffyrd full sharp travail or euyr he
entrede in to his glory / and for this wept he that we so lightly forgete our
self and take no head how wretchedly we be engendyrde nor how sorowfully we be
borne nor how perlously we live in sin and in vanyte nor how hedously we
shall deye nor know not when nor how sone nor of what death we shall deye

axed one time of saint petyr how our lord Ihu^ delte among his dyscyplys in
earth / and saint petyr began to weep full tendyrly Now fair maystyr said saint
clemente wherefore weep ye so petously / trewly said saint petyr I can not keep
me fro weeping when I here speak of him / or verily think on him and of his
gracious dedys / We were onday greatly grieved with hu^gyr and cold and at night
was lodged in an old house that was broken on the ton part thereof where the
cold entyrd greatly which anoyed us for our sweet maystyr / Ihesu christ put
him self between the cold and us and I perceived him that same night five
times with his own clothys couyr our fete / A good lord mercy and so humbly
served he us as to wash our fete how great a pity was this / In like wise
thenke how sorrowful. and heny he was against his peynful passco^n yt was so
right anguyshous / Think how he langourd ^xv days before his death for in
signyficacion thereof men sing and read of his pascio^ xv days before his
resurrexion / For than was he in sygh^ingys and heaviness and praiours / and so
full of troubill that he had lityll will to ete or drink nor of no conforte and
yette for all this he seyde to his / dysciplys Desiderio desidera ui hoc pasca
manducare vobiscum antequam paciar I have great desire to ete with you a soper
before I shall suffyr death / And his apostels appointed then where they should
ete their souper and ete yet And when they had supped he took of his ouyr
garnement and gyrd him with a toell and towke fair watyr in a basyn and wesh^ e

seynte gregory Quis tumore^ cordis no^ repellat si secu^ co^ferat quod qui

rancour of heart is so great that should not aswage if he well remembryd him of
him yt sytte so hie aboune angellis in heuene that wish ye feet of his own
traitor Judas / and aftyr he took bread in his fair handys and blessed yt and
thanked his father of all ye harm and pain yt he had suffryd in earth or
should suffyr / and gaf hit to his apostlys with his own handys to ete / and
seid Ete ye this for hit is in flesh and than took he wyn and blessed hit and
gaf hem to drink / and said Drink this for this is my blood drink and ete
now with good will. For neuyr fro henfforth shall I drink with you before I
have suffryd ye most marvelous and peynfull death that euyr man suffyrd in
earth. Alas what sorrowful tidings might his dyscyplys here than. A how they
were sorrowful and dyscou^fortted / Alas how they wept petously and no
marueyle though they made wo^dyrfull sorrow for he was all there help / and all
there comfort and now hard they verily yt they should lose him that same night
/ Alas wath sorrow and lamentable pleynte there was when ye sweet Ihu^ had be so
long in place for ye love of his love and so many vsuries of grievous peynys
and anguyshous ran upon him and he would not go owte of ye said place to the

upon ye high mount of caluarys where he was condemned of the cruel and felon

ANother great love of the world is between mother / and child and a Right
farue^te love should this be if ye child had such a syknesse that hit might
neuyr be helid but hit were bayned in the mothyrs blood and yff the mother
would make this bayne this showed well a great and special love / A this bayne
made the sweet Ihu christ the very parfyght good love when we were so syke of
sin so vile and so dyshonest yt no thing in all this world might wasshe us
hele us but alonly the precyus blood of / Ihu^ christ and he so gracyously yt
so good heart made us this bayne with out any again seeing as seyth saint John^
in the apocalypse. Qui dilexit nos and lauit nos in sanguine suo a peccates
nostris. He loved us and wysh^ us in his precious blood from our sins / Lo
when a man is seek of a great seknesse and may not endure an oura hot bain at
the beginning nor also he is not heled be the first bayne wherefore hit behooves
that he be often bayned and alwey warmer and warmer and in ye same manner made
Ihu^ criste our beynes oste^ in his p^cyng blod the first that he made was
when he was but viij days old.

Postquam consu^mati su^t dies octo vt circu^cideretur puer vocatu^ e^ nome^

lord ye sweet child was called Ihu^ by his name / But by ye blood that he
left thanne of his tender bodi in the cyrcumcysion ne were we not yette
enterli helede for we had the meselry of sin whereof we where so full of
syn^e and inpostumys that our soul was all full of hedowys matyr and venymous
/ before the face of the holy trynyte / And ye sweet Ihu^ took thereof so great
pite yt he went all alone by him self the night before his passion and fill
gronelinge to the earth byfor his father of heaven / and prayed him full
petousli for the health of his love our soul that was so sike of si^ne even at
ye death of hell that is so horyble / and saint barnarde seyth. Quasi nu^quam
membris oi^bus fleuisse videtur / He wept not alonli upon his father with his
blessed eyes but with all the membrys of his lody / for so full of compassion
was his pituous heart and so full of bitter anguyshys and hard labors was his
tender body thanne that the sweet of his read blood dropped from him as says
the gospel: Positis genibus and / c^ Et factus inagonia pro lixius orabat and
factus est sudor eius sicut gutte sangui^s decurrentis in tarra^ / He put his
weary kneys upon the h^arde earth and so long prayed his father till he was
allmoste in soue^ and in so great pain that the sweet sprange owte of his body
as drops of blood yt ran to the earth to bayne his love our soul to hele her
and make her fair and clean without and amyable to behold whereof seyth saint
banarde

Vere compaciendu^ est ei qui dedit nobis sudorem sangui^s in medicinam /
Trewli we ought to have great compassion and pity of our sweet lord Ihesu our
love that gaf us ye sweet of his precious blood for to bayne our sowlis / But
yete were we not all hole for our sowlis were enfundyrd in ye mortal dropsey
whereof we might never have health but it wre recoured by baynes Now this dropsey
is such a sykenesse that makyt a man orrbyly swollen for the foul humors /
that run between the skyn. and the flesh in such mannere were our wretched
sowlys / orrybly swollen and so hydowys that god would not that none of them
should enter in to heuene. byfor him they were so foul englutede and enuenyme
de with the fylthe of sin. And what did our sweet lord and love Ihesu christ
yt was the most wise fisicie^ he made a right precious and special bayn for
us / how he suffrid wilfulli that thise cruel felon Iewis took him and stryped
him as naked as he was borne / and bond him to a pylere of cold merbyll with
hard cords. and then ij felon turme^tours full quyk and ready to do evil
with ij scorges beat him cruelly without mercy and turme^t him so outrageousli
yt his tendyr skyn all to brake. and ye precious blood ran down his bodi and
leggis by stremis on to his feet in such wise was he there turmented that
many years after men might see the peler all blody whereof he says by the
prophet Isaye. Corpus meu^ dedi percucientibus et genas meas velle^tibus
faciem mea^ no^ auerti ab increpantibus et conspuentibus i^ me

IGaf my tender body to turmentis and strokes and my face I turned not fro
those folkis that spyte on me and shamefully blamed me / In such manner and
such traueyle made he this bayne to save his love our soul from all
swellynge of the syknesse of this spirituell dropsye / And yet was our sowles
stylle encombred with pain of the head that is a full sore sikenesse. Cui
capud i^firmum cetera membra dolent / A and who yt is seek in his head all
other parties of his body complain / And therefore ye good Ihesu saw the head
of his love so seek that she was all a^guished and enraged wherbi she cowde not
knoue god nor serve him he had so great pity and compasion thereof that himself

many places on his forhed as it is says in ye gospel. Plectentes coronam de

A sweet Ihesu this crown of your head is to me full dear Now fair friend
remember you wha^ne ye will sleep and your head is laid so eseli upon soft
pelowys / how peynfull was the crown of thorn vopn the head of the blessid
Ihu^ your spowse that shed so great plente of blood to hlpe your soul / Now
yette was there a another syknesse whereof our wretched soul languysht which
was stryken with the dedely letarge / these letarges. ben opellacon^s in the
veins and in the senewys enterlased preuyly that makes a man slumboryng and
alwey ready to sleep till he be deed / And in ye same manner were our sowlys sore
stryken with ye spu^all letarge whereby she another might nor cowde help her
self but abide stylle alwey in mortal neclygence unto ye time yt hit should
dyscende in hell / But how did the^n our sweet lord / and love Ihu^ christ /
wite for trewthe that he will fully suffyrd to be let blood on veynys and /
senewys and of all parties / of him for to baine the wretched soul of man /
And how was he let blood he suffyrd that these foul and vyleyne Iewys took
him with full great dysdeyne and hynge him all naked upon the cross / and
persed through his fair hand is / and fete with full great and mighty nails /
whereof him self seyth by david. Foderunt manus meas et pedes meos
dinumerauerunt omnia ossa mea. They have thyrled my handys / and my fete and
nombyrd all my bonys / Alas / what sorrow they did him so great that ye stremis
of blood ran from al perties of his blessed body with so gre^e speed that his
love might be baynet therwyth both wythowte and wythynne / But than might
our lord Ihesu christ sey to his love our soul my dear love now be ye far in
debt by reason ouyr all thyngys to love me Alas yette love ye me nod and I
have so often shed my ^lode to bayne and purge you from all siknesses / from
all fylthys / and yette for all this will ye not love me yette fair love now
shall I make you a gift of amore special love whereby ye should in no manner
deny me your love. I shall give you the holy blood of my heart to bayne your
heart in so that ye may alwey love me / The^n came a strong blind knight with
a long sharp spear and struck him so justly th^ugh the side that he persed
his am^rus heart. and forthwyth ran out great plente of blood and watyr and ran
full fast down upon his body / whereof he seyth in the book of love Vulnerasti
cor meum soror me a sponsa vulnerasti cor meum. now have ye woundyd my heart
fair suftyr and spowse now have ye wou^dyd my heart. what can ye axe me any
more of love / Now I prey you for my sake that ye will leave your sin so that
ye may love me the more swetly / whereof says saint bernarde No^ne pro te
vulneratus sum / non^e pro te satis afflictus sum / desine amodo peccare. quia
peccata magis grauant me. eciam vulnera peccati / quam vulnus lateris mei. Now
say me my love that I love so much / think ye not that I am wounded and
tormented enough for you / whereby ye ought to love me / Now leave your sins
then frohens forth / For the wound of your sin greuyth me more than did
the wound of my side A my dear friend put we us vtterli in devour to love
ihesu Christ our sweet love and spowse that suffryd so great pain to wasshe us
in his precious blood from all moral syknes / whereof our souls languysshid.
And else be we to far vnnaturell /

NOw see we the third love that is between the soul and the body / There is a
full great love between the soul and the lody. And that appears well / for
they ben in great torment and pain when they shall depart / For the gretter
love that is between friends / the greter pain is at their departing / And
there was neuyr body that so much louyd soul / nor soul body / as did the
body of Ihesu christ his soul / and his soul his body. which was no
merueylle / For there never was nor never shall be such a body and soul Joined
together / And yet for all that he suffered well that his soul departed from his
body / for to adioyne our pour souls to his without end in his celestyall
reygne / And by what death departed his glorious soul fro his blessid body. It
was by the most cruel death shamfull / and dyshoneste that they cowde deuyse
among them to Judge him to / A what sorrowful pity was of this death of Ihesu
christ / It was so cruel: that many a day and often he playned him to his
disciples before his death / And says in the gospel. Ecce ascendimus
Iherosolima^ etc^ / Loo my dear brethern we shall goo in to Iherusalem. And the
sone of mary shall be delyuerde by treason to the bishops and masters of the
law / And they shall condemn him to deye right cruelly. And how cruelly he
shall be delivered to Jews to mock / to beat and crucifye. and the third day
shall arise from death to life. And what merueylle was this. if he playnid him
of this dethe^ For his flesh was always as in languour and pain against his
death / as he says by dauyd / Estimabam me quasi mortuu^ super terram. I take
my self as a man deed upon the earth / And this was well preuid for it is not
found that ever he lough ones in all his life / but often times weptte he full
pytously / As wha^ he saw the sepulture of Lazare that was deed and beryed.
which was / a little before his passion. And he beheld full pytously upon the
body of Lazare / Fremuit inquid sp^u / et turbauit seipsum / et lacrimatus est
Ihesus / He tremblyd in his spirit. and trowblyd himself. and began to weep /
Men say that he is as a deed man that will not answer. when men either do or
say him any harm In such manner was it of Ihesu christ. as himself says by
David the prophet / Ego autem tanquam surdus non audiebam / et sicut mutus non
aperiens os suum For troth when men myssay me. I goo forth as a deef man that
heryth not / and as a dombpe man / that openyth not his mouth Of this cruel
death had he so great fere and trowble / that the night before he suffered his
passo^n / he took saint peter. saint James. and saint Johan with him / And
preuely before them three he began so great lamentacyon that it was merueylle.
and lokyd so pytously / And playned him so sorowfully: saying Tristis est
anima mea vsque ad mortem / sustinete hic / and vigilate mecum. Fair dear
brethren said he my soul is heavy torwade ye death / abide here with me. and
wake with me / For I am in full great trowble and fere / And then he
wythdrewe him fro them as far as one might cast a stone / and fell down
to the earth. and playnyd him full pitously to his fader in heaven / and said /
Abba pater cui onmia possibilia su^t / tra^sfer calicem hunc a me / Fair lord
god my right dear fader / to whom all thing is possible I pray you that ye
will remeue this hard death fro me / Nevertheless / not as I will /

But as ye will your will be done / I am ready to obey it / and to take this
death for the sauacyon of man^ys soul / Spiritus quidem promptus est / caro
autem infirma / Truly my spirit is ready to suffer this cruel death / but my
flesh is full trowbles and ferfull / Fiat volu^tas tua / Your will be done
fair sweet fader. And on ye morrow was he Iuged to the most hard death that
any man cowde Judge this was to be crucified. And then pylate said to the
felon Jews. Quid facia^ de illo qui dicitur xp^s / illi dixeru^t crucifige eu^
/ Pilate said to the Jews what will ye that I do of him that me^ call christ
/ and they said crucifye him Alas what sorrow was this how they yielded him
shrewdly his seruyse for all the weles and bou^tees that he had done to them.
they took him and crucified him to petously / And yet for all his pain he cried
to his fader mercy / And said Pater ignosce illis / quia nesciu^t quid faciunt.
A sweet fader perdon^e them of all this harm they do to me for they know not
what they do / A god mercy what merueyllous mekenes and sweet pite was this in
him / He said not fair fader venge me on these felon folks that slay me
without desert and cry so highly Crucyfie him crucyfie him. But he said
pardon^ them my death fair sweet fader / Hec mutacio dextere excelci This was
a wonderful change that always against harm. he did good / Sweet Ihesu yet
over these mortal pains that he suffryd in his woofull body. he had in his
co^passionable soul thremaner of anguyssles of full egyr and bitter sorrow /
that made him to sighe merueyllously with great tribulacion These three
anguisshes henge in his holy soul / as three sharp speres that smote him
always to the heart The first anguysshe was for the sorrow that his blessid
mother and the other three maryes made that were so wete with their sorrowful
teeres. The second anguisshe was for his disciples refused him and byleued not
in him. nor held him not for god. For this that he would not help himself to
escape^ And fled all from him / and left him al strange / Whereof he says by
the prophet dauyd /

Qui videbant me for as fugierunt a me. obliuioni datus su^ tanquam mortuus a
cord /

My discyples that saw me taken they fled fro me^ and I was putt in
foryetyng among hem as if I were deed / The third anguysshe was the great
sorrow that he had for these felon tyrauntes that put him to death: to see how
he lost his long traueylle for the sauacyon of their souls. and how he had
utterly lost them / And he says Non veni vocare iustos sed peccatores ad
penitenciam I came not in earth to call the rightful but the sinners to
penance /

And he saw well that they had the hertes so hard / that they would never
do penance. And among all thoos synnars at that time he wan but the thief
that was hanged on the right side of him / which cried him mercy^ And more
sorrow and more compascyon had he of the loss of Judas his traitor and of the
other felons / than of his own proper death / As he says by dauyd.

Zelus domus tue comedit me et alibi Tabescere me fecit zelus meus quia
oblitisunt verba tua inimici mei. Fair sweet fader the great desire that I have
to the sauacyon of your people werith me sore with sorrow and anguysshe / And
after he says my right great Jealousy makyth me all weary in my spirit / for
this that mine enmyes have forgoten your commandments And at the last wha^
he felt his cruel death approche^ his pour soul had full great trowble /
Then sighed he with cheueryng then cried he with pyteous playntes. then
wept his languysshyng eyes / as says saint powle. Cum clamore valido. et
lacrimis offerens exauditusest pro sua reuerencia / With great cry and teeres
he suffryd his soul depart with hard death / for the love of his dear beloved
/ man's soul / But what was his cry / the most sorrowful that ever was herd
Clamauit voce magna Eloy / Eloy / lamazabatani / hoc est deus meus / deus meus
vt quid de reliquisti me.

MY sweet fader my god / my god why have ye forsaken me^ and let me suffer so
cruel death. for the folk that give me no thanks for all the harms that I
have / and shall suffer for there love / Alas what great woo may be to all the
world / when Ihesu should deye weeping so pyteously. and so sorowfully
playninge / for such as took no more head of his hard passion that he suffered
for them / no more than if he never had become man / A another reason was
there as he playned him and wept full pyteously / for that so few folk
should be so dear bought / whereof saint gregorye says /

Si respicio facie^ cristi in cruce pendentis. primis michi occurrit quod
fleuit orans Sz quare fleuisti bone Ih^u / quare fleuisti cum pocius esset
gaudendu^ maxim tunc cum operabaris salutem in medio terre / affligens peccata
nostra cruce da^pnans diabolu^. Saluans miseros / fleuit igitur qr cu^ passio
sua sufficeret redempcioni oi^m profuit redempcioni paucorum / When I behold
the face of Ihesu christ hanging upon the cross First it ren^eth in my mind /
that he in praye^g wept. But whi wept ye sweet Ihesu / why wept ye / where
rather it should be Ioyed specially when he brought health in the mids of the
earth. and fyxed our sins on the cross / da^pnyng the devil / and saving
wretches. But for this wept he. that his passion was sufficyent ynough^ to the
redempcyon of all folks / and should prouffyte allonely to the redempco^n of
so few / For full few ben in all the world of Religyous or seculer / or any
other manner of folks of holy church or other that a right louyth the king of
glory the sweet Ihesu criste. as they ought. whereof says saint poul. Omnes que
sua sunt querunt non que Ihesu cristi / All folks seek e^tentyfly the
prouffyte of their bodies. and not the love that they owe to Ihesu christ / And
our lord himself says / Putas ne filius hominis inueniet fidem super terrain
/ Wene ye that that Ihesu the sone of mary found faith or charity in earth for
sothe full scarsely / Now dear friend remember ye how yourselfe has louyd full
pourly our good lord and love Ihesu christ / And how our neighbors of this
world be^ now corrupted with many manner of sins And how the death of our
sweet lord / and spouse ye sone of god was hard and cruel. Then^e ought we
well to weep togider with Ihesu christ / and cry him mercy whereof saint
Bernarde says / Tria sunt preciosa vnguenta / scilicz flere pro peccatis
proptiis / pro peccatis proximi / pro compassione passionis cristi / Three
precious oynementes ben / the one is precious. the other more precious. the third
rih^t precious. The precious is to weep for our sins / The more precious is
to weep for the sins of our neighbors. The right precious is to weep for the
compascyon of the cruel death of Ih^u christ / whereof says saint Bernarde / O
bone Ihesu si tam dulce est gaudere de te / A Ihesu if it be so sweet to weep
with you / how it shall be sweet to be Joyous with you / and after he says / O
bone Ihesu cito lacrimas inuenit and soluitur in gemitum qui tui sensum habet
doloris. O good Ihesu full soon might he find teeres and great matter of
sighynges that had any felinge and understanding of your sorrows and pains /
And after of the peteous playntes that ye made. And when ye cried with hyhe
voys to your fader / In manus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum In to thy
hondes fair sweet fader I yield my spirit / for the love of my dear love
man's soul to deliver from hell Et inclinato capite emisit spiritu^ / And
enclyned his blessid head and yielded his glorious spyrite / A fair friend
think on him that was so benygne to these hard torments / whereof saint
bernarde says.

O bone Ihesu benign cu^ hominibus conuersatus es. quam magna hominibus
largitus es / quam dura pro hominibus passus es qua^ dura verba. duriora
verbera durissima crucis torme^ta passus es / O good Ihesu how benygne thou
were conuersaunt with men how great things thou have given man / how hard
pains thou have suffryd for man / as hard words / hard betynges / and right
cruel and mortal torments / that blessid be thou most merciful Ihesu / For
never man suffered so hard death as he suffered for our souls to make us
parteners of all ye joys of heaven. And he suffered not oonly this cruel and
hard death but also the most foul and shamfull death that they might put him
to / And all this suffered he for the love of man's soul / For what shame was
this / that Judas this traitor merchant sold him to ye felon Jews to slay /
as men do an ox or a cow / And yet for a wretchid price / for thyrty pens:
For Judas scaryot said to the Jews Quid vultis michi dare et ego eum vobis
tradam / at illi constitueru^t ei triginta argenteos. What will ye give me and
I shall deliver you him / And establisshyd to give for him thyrty pens of
silver And he brought the Jews the same night to the place where our lord
Ihesu christ was. And when he came he said Aue rabi / Heyle master. and kyst
him / And our lord said to him full pyteously / Amice ad quid venisti. Friend
wherefore come ye /

Then^e came after the Jews / and took our lord full rudely / And full sore
bound him / as if he had be an arrante thief / And led him in ye cytee
before his mortal enmyes: Whereof himself playned him to them that led him
/ and said Tanquam ad latronem existis cum gladiis and fustibus comprehendere
me / cotidie apud vos eram docens in templo / et non me tenuistis:

A Why do ye me so great vilanye / that ye come with swerdes and wepens forto
take me as I were a thef / and every day I have be before you in the temple^
and ye took me not / wherefore do ye this to me now / But for all that they
left him not / but drwe him forth before cayphas / where the cruel Jews
accused him of felonye and treyson^ And he was brought forth thus as a lamb.
whereof he said / Ego quasi agnus mansuetus qui portatur ad victimam / I suffer
all togider the vilaynous words and reproaches as a meke lamb with out
resiste^ce that men beryth to slay But Cayfas their master took so great
disdeyne for this that Ih^u would not answer / yt he said to him in scorn^.
Where ben your dyscyples what folk ben they how have ye taught them / And
Ihesu answered / I am acustomed to speak openly and always to teache folk in
the synagoge and the temple / there as the Jews came / and in secret places
as here is I shall speak lityll / And what ask ye me^ ask them that have
herd what I have said And uneath had he ended his words / but there starte
forth a felon ribawde / that stroke him full cruelly in his fair vysage with his
hard hand / And said full egrely before all folks / Sic respondes pontifici.
Should thou thus answer to the bishop. A how the sweet Ihesu answerde to
this felon wretch / Si male locutus sum testimoniu^ perhibe de malo si autem
been cur me cedis / If I speak evil / bear witness of evil / and if it be
well / wherefore smytes thou me He said not thou cursid traitors ye have
stricken me with wrong / ye shall be confounded in hell / Whereby ye may see
his benignite But for all this the cruel tyrau^ts buffet him / and couerde his
blessed eyes / and beat with their cursid fystes all abowte his blessid head.
and smote his fair vysage full vylaynously / whereof saint bernarde says.
Libertas captiuorum traditur / gloria angelorum illuditur / splendour lucis
eterne et speculum sine macula conspernitur / deus omnium flagellatur / vita
hominu^ occiditur / quid nobis restat ad agendum / eamus et moriamur cum illo O
bone Ihesu trahe me me post te / non in odorem suauitatis sed in odorem tue
passionis. A Ihesu christ that was the deliverer of prisoners / he was delivered
to prison for us / The glory of angels was mocked for us / The shyner of
eternal light and myrrour without any spotte is dispysed / God almighty is
scourged / The life of man is slain / and what is now for us to do / Goo we
and deye with him: A good Ihesu draew me after the not in to the odoure of
swetnes / but in to the odoure of thy hard passion.

And when they had all the nyight tormented him / and done him all the harm
and shame they could. On the morn they assembled them all together. and Iuged
him to the most shamfull death that they cowde think / which was to be hanged
upon the cross / upon an high mountain between two thieves / whereof this
verse is said. Dismas et gismas medio diuina potestas / Et cum iniquis de
putatus est /

Dysmas the tone thief hynge on that one part / and Gysmas ye other thief on
the other part / and between them henge the divine mageste / this was our
lord Ihesu criste / And when he was Iuged / the cruel tourmentours and hangme^
trussed the heavy wood of the cross upon his back / as says saint Johan the
euangeliste / Eduxeru^t eum et cetera / They led Ihesu out of the cite / and
himself beringe his hard cross / so feynt and weary / that uneath might he
bear it / whereof he says by dauyd. Q m^ defecit in dolor vita mea / My lyff
and my force faylleth me in sorrow and pain / And when they saw he might not
goo so spedely as they would they took with force a strong man that passed by
the way / which was named simon / And made him against his will to bear the
cross. the sooner to haast the death of our lord Ihesu christ / And when they
took fro him the cross to deliver to simon. they smote our lord full cruelly /
Then^e came there wymmen of galilee following our lord / and wept full
peteously / And made full great sorrow to see him suffer so much shame and
pain without deserte And when he saw these wymen weep so sore: he had full
great pity / And said to them / Filie Iherusalem nolite flere super me / etc^
/

Daughters of Iherusalem weep ye not for me / but for yourselfe / and your
chylderne / For the days shall come wha^ ye shall say / blessed be the
bareyne woman ^ and the wombes that never bare child. and the breestes yt neur
gaaf souke / For then shall ye begyn^e to say / mountayns fall on us / and
the earth couere us / The cruel Jews led him forth. and hynge him on the
cross nakyd before all the people in the same foul place / where the stynkynge
rotyn careyns were of the bodies of theuis^ that they had put to death in that
same place before / Alas when he was crusifyed thus sorowfully / the cursyd
traitors escryed him so shamfully / and said / Moue^tes capita sua dixerunt
vath qui destruit templum dei / et in tribus diebus illud reedificat / salua
teipsum. si filius dei es descend de cruce:

They brandysshyd their hedes / and said in scorn^ / see him here that same
that will destroy the temple of god / and make it again within iij days / Now
save thiself if thou be the sone of god / Come down of the cross where thou
art hanged / Thus cried the felon Jews See that same that auau^ted him
himself to save other folks / and himself he may not save / See how these
unhappy Jews tempted him / thise same folk that did him the sunday before so
great honour^ that they laid their clothes in the way where he passed. and
cast flowers and branches before him and song Osanna filio david benedictus
qui venit in nomine domini

Glory and honor be done to Ihesu the sone of god / and of the lignage of
dauyd / And blessid be he that comes in ye name of our lord the king of
Iherusalem / w Whereof saint Bernarde spekyth of this shame / Ab eodom populo /
in eodem loco et in ipso tempore paucissimis interpositis diebus / primo cum
ta^to triumpho susceptus / postea crucifixus est / Of the same people and in the
same place / and abowte the same time. where he was first received with great
honor / After was he hanged on the cross as a thief. See how great
dyfference was this. then to receive him as king of Iherusalem / and forth
with to say. we have no king but cezar. And how the difference was between
ye region and the cross between the flowers and the crown of thorns before
him were clothes of silk and rich panes sprad / and now was he dispoyllid all
naked / Alas what shame Ih^u suffrid of tho same folk that did him so great
honor a litill before / and anon after so many reproaches. so vilaynously
hangyng on the cross between two theues^ for the love of his dear love man^es
soul was he thus shamfully slain / that men might hold him for master of the
theuis And hyng there so foul arrayed as if he were a mesell / as he says by
ysaye the prophet / Non est ei species neque decor / et vidimus eu^ and no
erat asspectus / et desiderauimus despectu^ and nouissimu^ viroru^ virum
doloru^ and sciente^ infirmitate^. et qua si absconditus vultus eius and
dispectus / vnde and nec reputauimus eu^ / Another bewte nor honor was in him
at that hour / And we saw him / and desired him dispysed / And the last and
most vile of all men / And his face dyfformyd with blood and foul spyttyng /
so that we had him in derysion / A sorrow of sorrows that the Emperor of heaven
and of all the world suffryd. So cruelly was he wounded for our wretched
souls of which we hold so lityll price For this admonestith saint Bernard
to take keep of the vilaynies and sorrows that Ihesu christ suffryd for us. And
says. Oho no considera filium virginis illusum / spictis linidum / plagis
confixum clauis / A man beheld the sone of the virgyn marye foylid with foul
spittynges. all blody of his wounds / and percyd with nails / Take heed of
the king of angels being on the cross / pale to the death / foul in flessh^ /
pass by this / And take keep wha^ ye see the figure how he is a man mekely
bowynge. a man smyten with shamfull death. A man like unto a mesell / A man of
al sorrows apperynge on his body and all wrapped in sorrow / And yet when he was
past all the anguyssh^ pain and shame that he might suffer in his life for the
love of his love man's soul they did him after his death the grettest shame
they cowde think. For they would not bery hi^ among other Jews / but without
the town / as a man that were acursed / And his blessid soul descended in to
hell / for to destroy the mortal enmyes of his love man's soul / And to
fetch them out that long had abyden him there Now for goddis sake let us
remember well how much we are bounden to love that sweet Ihesu christ / that so
many manner of shames suffryd to put us in honor And that he suffered so
shamfull death to conferme our sowles in the freedom of perdurable life / For of
all the peynes that been in this world shame is the grettest. For we may find
many of christian folk that will suffer hardness of lyffe / as fasting / lyeng
hard: cold hungre / thurst / and diseases for the love of god / But to be
holden vile and dyspysid for the love of god uneath shall ye find any / For the
wretchid heart desires always to be honored and praysid / And by this we may
well know that he louyd us and louith us enteerly / that so many shames and
dispytes suffered for ye love of us.

The same that is the very perfyte honor / and of him comes all honors that
blessid be he of al creatures that us so much has louyd. and louyth. that
gracyous lord / the most true and hertely lover Now have we spoken great
part of his hard death / and of the shame that men did him / whereby ye may
here that never man deyed of so paynfull and vile a death / whereof he pleyneth
him by the prophet dauyd saying /

Defeccio tenuit me pro peccatoribus derelinqentibus legem tuam /

Fair sweet fader full great defawte^ me holds for sinners / yt have lest
your law Now for truth their was neuyr man had more of pouerte and defawte
than he had in his hende / and this shows seynte barnarde that seyth. Lignum
defuit capiti. terra pedi vestimentum corpori. potus ori. amicus consolacioni^
Alas what defawte was this / the tree failed to his head / the earth failed to
his feet / clothyng failed to his body / every friend failed to his conforte /
Now behold more verily of this great defawte that the tree failed to his head
for the cross where he hinge was without head. for when he was so weary and his
head grieved him that was so sore betyn and brosed with many great strokes* that
vnethe his neck might bear hit hit was so astoned with pain / and when he had
so great need to rest his woeful / head he found not so much ease that he
had any place to lene hit to. he was streyned so hye upon the cross that his
head might towche no part thereof / A what unmeasurable peynes / and sorrows he
had / there found he an ouyr hard and sharp pelow / for the head of so noble
and great a king as he was O good lord when we feel any great pain or
febilnesse in our hedis we will have soft pelowys under our hard hedys / and
some woman or some man to hold hit for taswage the peine but he had another the
ton nor ye tothyr but skornars as him self seyth be Ierom the prophet. Factus
sum in derisum omni populo meo canticu^ eorum tota die

I Am made in derysyon and in mockage of all my people and their eueriday song
The toth^r great defawte that earth failed to his fete and not to them only but
to all his body / that was so cruelly peyned that he was seek on to the death
and in all the large world had he not so much of place as he might put oon
foot on earth to rest his woeful body / that was all to betin / and brosed /
but hynge in ye air tered with great nayles^ full petously Alas their is not so
vile a sarazin ne so foul a mesell ne so pour a wretch but that they might
find some place or house where they might take some rest or ease in there
syknesse. A sweet Ihu^ christ wherefore would ye be in so great dyssese ouyr all
other of the wolrde Trewly for love so much had bounden him in such wise yt
he raught not of all the dysesys he had for the foruent love he hade to mannys
soul. Now se here the third defawte / that was Clothing to his / fair body
as he seyth by Job: Nudus egressus sum de vtero matris me. and nudus reuertar
illuc^ All nakyd I am come fro my moders womb / and all nakyd I shall return
out of this world / For the felon Jews had robbed him of his clothes. and
departed them among them / as he pleyneth him by david the prophet /

Considerauerunt et inspexeru^t me / deuiserunt vestimenta mea et super vestem
meam miserunt sorte^ Thise Jews have considered and beholden me / and have
divided my clothing to them and cast lottes thereon. which of theyrs it
should be And the sweet Ihesu would not strive against them / but with good
will gaaf them for their service all that he had of erthly thing which was
no more but oonly his clothes / so pour was he at that time / for thus says
saint bernard Quando fuisti pauperior / tunc fuisti largior O bone Ihesu. Wha^
thou were most pour. then were thou most large / for then^e gave thou to
the thief the kingdom of heaven / to saint Ioh^n evangelist thy mother / to thy
fader thy spyryte / and to us thy flesh to ete / and thy blood to drink /
And thou gave thy clothing to thy crucyfyers / in such wise that thou^
abodeste all nakyd on hye upon the patyble / A good lord god mercy the most
strong thief of the world that were Iuged to be hanged yet should he have to
cover him a pour gown or a pour sherte But Ihesu the king of glory had another
gonne nor sherte to cover him / where he hynge openly before al folk. whereof
he playneth him by dauyd / Factu^ est cor meum tanquam cera liquescens in medio
ventris mei / My heart is becomen all soft and meltyng as it were wax in my
body / Alas we pour wretches what Joy may we have of our honor / that is
come of none other thing. but of the shame of Ihesu christ. What gladness may
we have of ease that is com of the dysese of the sweet Ih^u christ / How may we
gloryfye us of our riches that comes of the pouerte of Ihesu crist What delight
may we have of our fredom / that is all comen of the bonds and e^prysonement
of our lord ihesu christ / It never pleysed him that he should suffer and bear
on his body all the harm and pain that we have so much deseruyd / without
we ben parteners with him in some manner of penance and sorrow. For troth so
shall we do if we will be parteners of his Joy / For he is not wort^^ to be
partener to the wynnyng / that will not be partener to the loss whereof saint
bernarde says.

Videntes angustias dn^i nostri Ih^u cristi. leuiter portauimus nr^as If we saw
thanguysshes that our lord Ihesu crist suffered for us we should bear ours the
more lightly. And if we will not be of his lyuerey in compassion. it is no
reason we should be of his lyuerey in consolacyon /

See ye now the fourth defawte that Ihesu christ had / that was drink fayllid
him to his mouth / Two manner of me^ have great need of drink / A man that has
much traueiled / and a man that has much bledde. And both thise things were
in our lord Ihesu christ that day. For never may was so weary of paynfull
traueylle and wooful service as he was. whereof him self says by Ysaye the
prophet Service me fecistis in pecti^s nostris / et laborem michi prebuistes
in iniquitatibus nostris /

Ye make me serve in your foul sins to give my labor in your Iniquyte /
And after he says Ysaye / Laboraui sustinens I have traueylled in suffrynge /
For I have suffered all the harms that men would do me. for the love of man's
soul / And if ye will ye may find wreten: that in that labor he traueylled
so much / that the blood ran fro his tender bodi / forto cry for mercy to
his fader. for his love man's soul / that was condemned to perpetuel prison
/ As he says by Iherom Laboraui rogans I have sore traueylled in prayeng for
your souls / these were hard labors / The second cause to say he was let
blood / It was not of one vein / nor of two. but he bledde over al his body /
In so many places^ that it was great dyfficulte to number the wounds of the
amyable body of Ihesu christ / that plenteuously bledde^ But when we ben let
blood upon a lityll vein on our arms. we keep us all stylle and cloos in a
chamber / that none air come in to hurt us. And have all things ordained to
our comfort A good lord al otherwise went it at your paynful bledyng. that
was so cruelly drawn out of the town. without any mercy or pity / and by the
shamfull tyrauntes hanged upon the Cross against that brennyng son streyned
as streyte as^ a parchemyn skin to dry / And by these paynfull wou^des and
labors / he had great thirst which was no merueylle / And then he pleyned
him peteously / and said / Scicio / I have thurst / and what then. They gaaf
him no ypocras nor wine / ne yet fair water / But they gaaf him eysel and
galle meddled together /

Alas what drink was this to be given at so great a need. Cum gustasset
noluit bibere. sed dixit consu^matum est /

When he had taasted he would not drink / but said all is fulfilled / Then
might he well have sait alas / now am I outrageously served / yt for all the
company that I have had with them and for all the honors that I have showed
to them / they yield me now thus shrewedly my seruyse. that in so great
disease as / I am now in / and in so great defawte they will not give me a
lityl water to drink. Now am I outrageously served / For truly this same did
more harm than many other of the pains that he suffryd^ And no merueyle /
for he had long labored for to teache them for to save their souls* and to
draw their love toward him / And for all this great love yet at the last
they did him this great vilanye Whereof he pleyneth him by Iherom the prophet
saying /

Recordare paupertatis and trangressionis me absinthij and fellis / Fair
friend remember you of the pouertee that I suffered for you / And remember of
the great disptes that was done to me^ wha^ they gaaf me to drink so evil a
drink for your love / whereof says saint bernarde / Sitiui salute^ vestram / I
have thurst said our lord / and not oonly for drink / but oonly for your
sauacyon / O good lord mercy / who had ever in him so ferme love as he / when
he was in so paynfull caas / that he felt the fevers of his hard death prick
so sore his pyteuous soul / Yet said he not alas / the hard cross
destroys my seek body. But he said I have great thirst that my love may be
deliuerde from hell / He said not how these thorns raze mine wooful head /
Nor alas how my ho^des and fete ben broken and perced with great nails. Nor
alas that I should suffer so many great pains without deserte / But he said I
have desire that my love were sauyd* as saint bernarde says. Tantu^ me
dilexisti o bone Ih^u quod inmemor fuisti doloris / and no^ inmemor me
salutis. dixisti scico^ non dixisti doleo / So much thou have louyd me o good
Ih^u. that you have not remembryd thy sorrow / and yet thou had ye
remembrance of my saluaco^n / wha^ thou saydest I thurst after your salvation
/ and said not I have great sorrow for my pains / But all otherwise took it
the felon Jews / and therefore they did him such a noye / that they most
bitter eysell and galle gaaf him to drink /

The fifth defaute that was full great / was when every friend failed to his
comfort / so as himself pleyneth him by dauyd / Singulariter sum ego donec
transeam I am left allone without comfort. till that I be passed out of
this mortal life / Whereof he says by ysaye. Circumspexi et non erat
auxiliator. I beheld all about me. and there is none that of any thing
helps me / or will comfort me / And sith says he by ysaye Torcular calcaui
solus / and non erat de gentibus vir mecum / I have trodden in the vylayn
pressours all alone / and of all the folks in the world I have not one man
with me Whereof says ysaye Quare ergo est rubium indumentum tuum et vestimenta
tua sicut calcancium in torculari / But fair lord god wherefore was then thy
vestyment so read / as they that have pressed wine at the pressour. Ye for
troth the vestyment that he was clothyd in was his clean skyn / that was all
read of his blessed blood as he had pressid red wine all alone with out
comfort and without help / But fair friend ye would say perauenture. that
allone without comfort was he not / For he had his dear mother full nere him
for to comfort him. It is troth his sorrowful mother was nere him: but he was
more payned of the compasco^n of his piteous mother than of his own pascyon /
And this may ye here by a lamentacyon of our lady / yt saint bernard writes
that begyn^eth thus / as herafter follows /

QVis dabit capiti meo aqua^ et oculis meis fontem lacri marum quod possim
flere per diem and noctem donec seruo suo dominus Iheus cristus coopereat visu
/ vel sompno consolans animam meam

Who shall give to my head water and to mine eyes a well of teres that I
might weep by day and night so long. that it would pleyse our lord Ihesu
christ to apere to me his servant in sight. or in dreme to comfort my weary
soul. O ye daughters of Iherusalem the blessid friends of our lord help me
to weep in praye^g / and pray in weeping so long. that our spouse in his bewte
so benign / and so sweet to us will appear / Think devoutly / and remember
ententyfly in your hertes how bitter a thing it is to be departed from him to
whom ye have promised euerychone hoolily to hold you. to whom ye have auoued
yield your souls / then to him fair daughters / fair virgynes. fair maidens
and pure / that have auowed chastyte to Ihesu criste / come to the sweet
virgyne that bare him. For she bare the king of glory And she will give him
or her that will require him with good love / She bare him she gaaf him souke /
the eight day he was circu^cysed / and the xl day he was presented to the
temple / and offered for him ij turtles / And after fled for fere of herod /
and bare him in to egipte / and nourisht him and took keep of him / and followed
him from place to place till he came to the cross. And left she him there
then^e nay truly* she tarried there as long as ever she might / I believe
verily that she was among tho wymen that followed Ihesu crist for to serve him.
And it was no merueyle though she followed him / for he was all her Joy / all
her comfort. and all her desire / Wherefore I suppose well that she was among
them that compleyned our lord in weeping. She wept then with thoos daughters
of Iherusalem / to which Ihesu beryng his cross turned and said / O ye
daughters of Iherusalem ne weep ye not on me / but weep ye on yourself: and on
your chyldern /

The voys prayeng the blessed mother of Ihesu crist / O lady of paradys
thamyable mother of our lord Ihesu christ is it not this troth that I say /
Now blessid lady I humbly beseech you / that it like you to say me the troth
/ and not to dyspleyse you / though I your servant speak thus hardely to his
lady / And to the intent sweet vyrgyn that I may more worthily and deuotly
here what it will pleyse you to say / I beseech you that ye will give me some
of the teeres that ye had in the passo^n of your dear child. And to show me
the manner of the compaseyon and sorrow that ye had then.

The voys of the vyrgin marye Transsumptiue illa respondit illud quod tu queris
/ conpungitiuum est magni doloris / sed quia glorificata sum. flere non possum.
tu autem cum lacrimis / scribe ea que magnis doloribus ipsa perpensi. She
answerde / a fair friend / this thing that thou desire is co^puncyon with
great sorrow / but for by cause that I am gloryfied. I may not wepe^ But write
thou with teres those things the which I myself h^aue suffryd with great
sorrows /

The voys prayeng / A lady of paradys / grant me this that ye speak / and
then have I all that I desire O queen of heaven mother to the crucified christ
Ihesu / say to me what it pleyseth you / And your pour servant shall humbly
here* what that it likes you to say / And my dear lady I beseech you that ye
will vouchesauf to tell me if ye were in Iherusalem when your sweet sone was
taken and bound /

The voys of the blessid virgyn Cum illa respondit / in Iherusalem eram qua^do
hec audiui gressu qualicunque potui and vix potui ad deum meum flens venire
cunque illum fuissem intuita pugnis percuti / et alapis cedi / in facie conspui
/ spinis coronari / et obprobriu^ hominum fieri. commota sunt omnis viscera
mea. et defecit spiritus meus / and non erat michi flere / neque sensus neque
vox.

Which answered fair friend in Iherusalem I was. when I herd that he was taken
/ Then spedde I me forth gooyng as I might / and scarsly al weeping as I was
cowde I come to my god. And when I beheld him stryken with fystes / and beten
with great strokes / in his blessid face bespitted crowned with thorns / and
made the repreef of men / Then was I so inwardly meuyd with sorrow that my
spyryte faylled me / so that I was as then past weping / wit or voys. But I
was not allone for there were with me my susters and other wymen full heavy and
sorrowful. that wept for my sweet child as much as he had be there is Among
the which was marye mawdeleyne / that over al other save myself made sorrow /
And then pylate commanded that Ihesu christ should be brought forth to his
torments / and bear the cross him self: upon the which he should dey And
thus was he drawn toward his dedely torments / And then was there full
great prees of people that followed him / And some mockid him / and some cast
mire and filthe upon his head. and in his sweet face / which all the heavenly
corte deliteth to behold: And I his sorrowful mother followed him with other
wymen of galilee / and I was as half deed with sorrow. But they supported me
till we came unto the place of his passion where they crucyfyed my sone before
mine eyes / And he beheld me so pyteously / and saw me / and I him when he
was reised upon the cross / fastened with three great boyustyous nails of yren
/ And more me thought he sorowed for me / than of his own pain / And he took
it as mekly as it were a la^be before them that crucyfied him / And made no
noise / nor opened not his mouth / And I seek as I was beheld my lord and my
sone hangyng on the cross / and of so right foul death deyeng in sorrow I was
then so traueylid in my thought. that it can not be spoken of no mouth.

And it is not to be merueylled / he was of so meke a look and of so sweet /
of word / and so benygne in every conuersacyon: And there saw I his precious
blood run with great stremes in all parties in such wise that his visage was
all streyned therwyth / and all his beauty changed so much. that he was
before the most fair that ever was / semyd then to be the most foul of all
other / Then saw I well that the prophecye of Isaye was accomplysshyd in him

Vidimus eum / et non erat ei species neque decor /

WE saw him / and in him was another beauty nor honor / it was so changed by
betyng and spyttynges / and casting of mire / and other fylth upon him by
these cursyd people / Trueli this was to me a grievous torment. to see me thus
sorowfully dysceyued from him that I had borne / and nouryshyd. and now to be
left allone / wyche increased me with sorrow upon sorrow / so that my voice
failed me / when I would speak. there took me such a sorrow that closed my heart
so that I cowde no thing do but snobbe and sighe when I saw in deyenge the
same that deyed for love. and that my soul louyd / And then beheld he me
and saw that I wept and would have comforted me / But in no manner I could
receive no comfort / And then I wept in seenge and said in weeping / Alas
fair sone why grant ye me not to dey for you^ Alas what shall I now do my
dear sone deyeth / wherefore deyeth not his sorrowful mother with him. A fair
sone my oonly love leave not after you / But take me with you so that ye deye
not thus allone / but let us deye together. suffer your woofull mother to be
slain with you / O ye wretched death / ne spare me not. for now your coming
should pleyse me. slay me with my sweet sone that is al my Joy and all my
comfort / and the life of my soul. Now my dear sone do so much that I may
dey with you sith I have borne you to this cruel death. Alas take keep now of
your sorrowful mother. and here my prayer / Receive me with you in your passion
in such wise that we that have liuyd in one flesh and loved of one love may
deye of one death / A ye cruel men wherefore sp^re ye me since ye crucyfie my
child / crucyfie me with him / or make me deye of some other death / I rekke
not what it be so that I deye with my sone / Alas my sweet child should ye
deye thus allone Now see I my life deye / and my health perysshe / All my hope
is taken out of therth / Wherefore lives the sorrowful mother after the sone
Take the mother. and put her to death with her sone / sith ye spare not the sone
spare not the mother /

A Death thy cruelte now to me should be great Joy if I might deye with my
sone Ih^us. A woo is me / the death that I desire so much departs fro me A
my dear child. it is much better for me to deye than to live a dedely lyffe /

O dear sone / o blessid sweet sone receive the prayers of your sorrowful mother
And be not hard to her that has be always so benygne to all other / Truly it
is according that the sone should here his sorrowful mother so dyscomforted /
Now sweet child receive your mother with you on your cross / that I may live
always with you after your death / For truly there should no thing be to me
so Joyful as to deye with you upon the cross. Nor no thing may be to me
more paynfull than to live after your dethe^

A fair sweet child / the very true sone of god. have pity on your sorrowful
mother. For ye be my fader and my mother Ye be my husbonde. ye be my sone / ye be
all the Joy and comfort I have in this world / And now am I Orphelin of
fader / wydowe of husbonde / dyscomforted of child / These cruel Jews have
taken all from me A fair sweet sone what shall I do frohens forth / Fair lord
what shall befalle on me / My dear child where shall I find conforte / Most
special friend / and all my love / where shall I find help and counsel
Fair sweet sone I know well that ye may do what that ye will But if it pleyse
you not that I dey now with you / I beseech you that ye will leave me some
gracyous comfort.

The voys of our lord to his blessed mother answeryng there where he hyng so
paynfully on the cross / And tornyd his eyes full pytefully toward saint
Ioh^n theuangelyst / and said to his mother. Woman see there your sone / And
saint Johan was then there present full pyteously. and contynuelly weeping /
Ac si diceret. O maria dulcissima mollis ad flendu^ and mollis ad dolendu^ / tu
scis qr ad hoc rem veni / ad hoc de te carne^ su^psi. vt per crucis patibulu^
saluare^ genus hu^anum.

As if he had said O most sweet marye being so ready to compassion and weeping
/ and so ready to pyteous sorrow / ye know well that for this I came: and for
this I took flesh of the. that by the patyble of the cross I should redeem
mankind. How otherwise should be the scryptures accomplysshyd whereby ye know
well that it behooves me to suffer death for the sauacyon of mankind / And the
third day I shall arise again and appear to the and to my dyscyples / Now
sease ye your wepynges and your sorrows fair sweet moder^ sith that I goo now
to my fader^ where I shall receive the glory of my paternall majesty / Ye
ought to make Joy with me / and be glad of this that I shall find the
sheep that has erred so long / and be lost / For oonly one shall dey / by
whom the world shall be sauyd / And this that pleyseth to god my fader ^ how
should it dyspleyse you my sweet moder^ Wherefore I pray you weep no more / nor
make no more thise sorrowful complayntes / For I shall not leave nor forgete
you. But am and shall be with you always with out end / For though I am not
after the flesh obeysaunte to the death / yet after my dyuinyte I am and
shall be always Inmortal and vnsuffrynge of pain /

WEll know ye fair sweet mother frowhens I came Wherefore be ye then^e so
sorrowful / though I ascend there frowhens I descended / It is time that I
return to him that send me hither / And there may not ye come now / but
surely ye shall come after. And in the mean time Johan that is your neuewe
shall be instead of your sone and shall take keep of you / and be your true
comfort and then beheld our lord saint ioh^n and said to hi^ See here thy
mother I recommende her unto the / and pray the fair sweet friend serve her /
and take good keep of her / For I deliver her unto thy keeping / Receive thy
mother Johan / and not as thy mother without more. But receive her more gladly
for this that she is my mother. Truly few words spoke our lord But when
thise two that herd him thus swetli speak / they sesed not of wepi^g But
sorrows martred them in such wise that they cowde not speak one word.

These two blessed vyrgyns herynge our lord thus speak with hole voys / And
saw him draw nere to his death / they cowde not answer one word / but were as
ha^f deed / fay^linge both their spirytes and voice / They wept full bytterly
And sorowed for the sword of the passion of our lord Ihesu christ perced
thorugh their souls / This sword perced them both full cruelly. and whoo
most fervently louyd most cruelly was tormented This was the mother that felt
the sorrows that her sone suffered / The sword of sorrow was the wounds of
Ihesu christ / which were paynful torments in the soul of his mother / When
Ihesu christ had deliuerde his blessid mother in the keeping of saint Johan. And
he saew that tender mayde^ so pyteously wepe^ snobbe and sighe. that no
thing in all this world might comfort her / then had he so great sorrow /
that by compassion thereof the anguysshe of the hard death seized him by the
heart / And cried with merueyllous voys and sorrowful / and yielded up his
spyryte / Now may ye see well how he had fawte of every manner of comfort /
and how his blessid mother did him then more of sorrow than of comfort /

Now have ye herd how hard death and shameful the sweet Ihesu has suffryd
for the love of his love our souls / If she would yet in any manner give him
her love / And have compascyon of him / and all his payneful death whereof be
many things that may increase our love and our compassyon.

The first thing is the great sorrow that was in our lord Ihesu christ: of the
which he says by Jeremy / Non est dolor sicut dolor meus /

THere is no sorrow like unto my sorrow / and it was no merueylle / For much
more tender is a young clean vyrgyne In^ocent without syn^e than an old
wretched syn^er / Now was there never a more pure vyrgyne ne more tender. nor
so clean as was the blessed pure virgyn mary the fair mother of our lord.
Ihesu christ / of whom he tork his humanytee of the most pure dropes of her
vyrgynal blood without syn^e and any substance of the humayne seed. For wh^an
this blessed bodi was borne of his mother / he was more tender than is the apple
of ye eye. And as lityll pain did grieve in his sweet body / as it should do in
the sight of our eye.

For his blessed mother was never blamyd of sin / whereof he was so tender
that there was never man / nor none other creature that in this world did
suffer so great sorrows / and so hideous torments as did our lord Ihesu
christ in his tender body two and thirty year during / always grievous and more
grievous. And he received them full hardely and wisely for the love of his
love. as he says by Ysaye.

Ideo posui faciem meam vt petram durissimam / et subditur / qui est
aduersarius meus. / accedat ad me / Therefore I have put my face as a right
hard stone / who says who is. mine adversaries come to me to do me asmoche
harm as they will / And I shall receive them for the love of my love / The
second is / the Right great love / and that appeared between Ihesu christ and
his mother / For by the great love that his mother had toward him / the sword
of hard marterdom passed thorugh her soul as Symeon promised her. when she
offryd Ihesus in the temple / Et tuam ipsius animam pertra^sibit gladius / The
sword shall pass thorugh your soul / Also dauyd playneth him gretely for his
sone Absolon in the book of kyngis / Quis dabit michi vt ego moriar pro te.
Alas mi fair sone absolon / what shall I do since ye be deed: wherefore may I
not deye for you / Thus seems it that the death of his sone was more grievous
unto him. than should have be his own propre dethe^ In like wise our blesyd
lady had by many fold more sorrow of the death of her sweet sone / than she
should have of her own /

And accordyngly chyldern have great love unto there mother / and nature meueth
them to be in full great fere and sorrow when they see their mother beten or
wounded / But what child saw ever his mother thus martred and so beten and
wounded of mortal sorrow as Ihesu christ saw his mother / Not oonly in body ne
in her tender heart but in her holy soul that was specially crucyfied with him.
And who louid ever mother so tenderly as did the sweet Ihesu christ Whereof says
saint Ancelme / Alloquens filius cum benedicta matter sic dixtt vestro continuo
a more langueat cor meum liquefiet anima mea / deficiat caro mea vtinam sic
viscera anime me dulci feruore dileccionis vestre ex arescere^t ne viscera
carnis me ex arescant /

HOw swetely the Sone of god Ihesus spoke to his blessed mother aynt Maryes that
said / Fair mother of your contynuell love that ye have to me my heart
languysshyth my soul may wexe soft. my flesh may faylle. I desire that the
entraylles of my soul might dry for favor of your love / as ye entraylles
of my flesh ben dried for langour of a^guisshe and of greuaunce^

Alas how great pity is it wha^ so good friends shall depart with so great
sorrow /

THe third reason is wherefore men ought to have compassion of his great
Innocence. For gretter sorrow is it to see a man suffer great harm with out
deserte / as saint peter says / Ip^e enim peccata non fecit nec inuentus est
dolor in ore eius^ He never did sin nor no treyson / wherefore we ought to
have the gretter sorrow / that he suffered so much torment for us / as Ysaye
says / Ipse enim vuln^ratus est propter iniquitates nostras. at tritus est
propter scelera nostra. Truly he was mortally wounded for our Inyquyte / and
all defoylled for our felonyes / A man that has a noble heart will have full
great compa^^o^n when a another shall suffer pain for his deserte. For he
himself thinks he felith the pain in himself / whereof it is wreten in the
book of kings. That when Dauyd by pride had nombred his people / wher^ore our
lord sent ^n angel to slay his people. for the displeysure that he took of
the same pride And when dauyd saw the angel slay his folk / he said to our
lord full pe^eously /

Ego sum qui peccaui / ego inique egi / isti ^ui oues sunt / quid fecerunt.
vertatur obsecro ira tua contra me / O fair lord said he I have sinned / and
I am he that has done evil / these folks that been innocents / what have
they done wherefor they ben slain / I beseech the lord that thou return thy
wrath toward me / and take vengaunce on me. for I am worthy / and they not /
Thus may we saye^ a lord god mercy / we ben they that have ynned / we ought
by reason to suffer passion and death /

A good Ihesus / ye sinned never / wherefore should ye bear the vengaunce of our
trespaces and evil deeds /

The fourth thing is his noblenes / for gretter pite is it of a noble man when
he is vile entreated tha^ of a vile person / And there was never none found
so noble nor of so ryall nor gentle lygnage. as was the sweet Ihesu christ /
For he was and his the sone of the king of heaven / of the earth / and of hell.
and of all them that been therein. And by his mother was he comen of the lignage
of the rich king dauyd and of the wise king Salamon / A good lord mercy. for
he was lityll accustomed to lead such life Full strange was it to him to suffer
such pains / as ysaye says / Alienum opus eius / vt operetur opus suu^
peregrinum est ab eo Much changed is his work that he does this vile craft
/ It is full strange to him / And this shows saint bernarde more openly /
Illud capud angelicis spiritibus adorandu^ and tremendu^ ^ spinis et tribulis
coronatur ^ aures que audi unt can^us. angeloru^ audiuit insultus iudeoru^
dicencium / crucifige crucifige eum. oculi lucidiores / sole calligauerunt in
morte / etc That head is crowned with thorns and breres / that is worshipped
and fered of angels / The eres which here the songs of angels. then^e
herd the cryenge of Jews. crucyfye him crucifye him / The eyes yt ben
bryghter than the sone became then all derke in his death. The face that is
most fair among the sons of men was then all foiled with foul spittynges.
The ho^des that maden heaven and earth were streyned then on the cross. The
fete that be to be honored were then rudely nailed to the tree / O good lord
there was never so noble a person / so gentle nor so curteys. And yet was
never none so sorowfully entreated. The fifth reason that was in (...) his
benignyte And his (...). whereof saint poul says / ad (...) Apparuit benignitas
and hum^nitas saluatoris nostri cord dei / The benignyte and the humanyte of
god our savior apereth / And ihesu himself said. Discite a me quia mitis sum
and humilis cord Learn this of me fair love / for I am humble of heart: O
saint mary mercy / when he was so benygne a man and so debonayr. what need
was it to beat him so felonously / what need was it so cruelly with a sharp
spear to perce his sweet heart so mortally / What need was it thus to tormente
him and so shamfully to draw so blessid a child / so fair a sone and so
debonayr^ and of so humble a heart as our lord Ihesu christ was / Alas alas
wherefore bound and slew the felon jews so rudely the same that never did
harm / but to all folks showed love and debonayrte / whereof saint austin
playneth him full greatly saye^g / Odolor inestimabilis o angustia singularis /
palmatur que est vera palma victory / spinis coronatur qui venit spinas
peccatoru^ confringere ligatur* qui soluit co^peditos in ligno suspenditur qui
erigit elisos. sons vite. sitis panis / angeloru^ esurit / Quid plura

inperpetuu^ moriatur

Sorrow Inestymable / O anguisshe synguler he was palmed* that is the true palm^
of victory / he was crowned with thorns / that came to break the thorns of
sin / He was sore bound that came to lose them that were in bonds / He was
hanged on the cross / that reyseth hem that been overthrown / The well of life
had thurst / The bread of angels had hungre: And what more. discypline was
beten / Health was wounded / Life for a time was deed to slay death wythouten
end / There was never none herd of creature that received by many fold so
great harm in reward of his great goodness. And then to remember his
benignyte and his great debonairte / whereof holy church makith great sorrow in
an ympne of ye passion / And pyteously complains that so gracyous a body was
so cruelly stryken with a spear / and perced so deep with great nayles^ and
says then to the cross. Flecte ramos arbor alta / etc. O ye hye tree of the
cross / wythdrawe your branches / slake your entrayles / yt ben so stratchyd
/ and your rygour the which he gaaf / aswage you siyth all the members of the
souereyne debonayre king is streyned on the hard stock. The sixth cause
wherefore men should have com^pascyon of our lord Ihesu christ this was the
semblaunce of other things that maken sorrow / For when a man sees other
folk make sorrow / he is more apt to sorrow with them / In like wise behold
how many ensamples were of sorrow wha^ our lord Ihesu christ deyed / The
unreasonable creatures made sorrow / The son wythdrewe his light hidyng his
bemys and became al derke / The hard stones all to brake^ thus as though they
had compascyon of their creator The veil of the temple claf on to as if it
were for anguysshe of the spowse of holy church. whoos bodi was so pyteously
entreated / The bodies of deed folk aroos for ensample of that sorrow / And
that men ought to remember that death with great compascyon: And also it is a
great ensample of pity and sorrow the lamentable complaint that his blessid and
sorrowful mother made for the death of her sweet sone when she was left allone
of all friends auf of saint Johan / to whose keeping she was delyuerde /
beholding then her dear child deed upon ye cross hangyng between two thieves
/ Well might she make then the most sorrowful complaynte that euyr was made
/ Whereof says saint Bernarde / Quis dabit capiti meo aquam / etc. And when her
sone was deed on the cross / saint bernarde says thus / Cogitare libet
quantus dolor tu^c. i^fuit matri mulieri cu^'sic dolebant insensibilea / non
lingua loqui. nec men's cogitare valebat quanto dolor afficiebantur pia viscera
marie

IT may be thought full great sorrow was in his blessed mother. when the
creatures that felt not made so great sorrow as is before rehearsed / there
can no tongue say. nor heart think how merueyllous great sorrows and pyteous
torments was in ye heart of that blessid vyrgyne mary and saint bernarde says
/ Nu^c soluis virgo maria cum viscera quod in partu mutuasti a natura. dolore^
pariendo filiu^ non sensisti quem milies replicando filio moriente passafuisti
/ Now sweet virgin ye have yielded with esurye this that in the birth of your
sone was changed against nature^ For in his birth felt ye no sorrow nor
pain But in his death felt ye the thousand fold of sorrows / The mother was
nere unto the cross at the death of Ihesu crist / which she conceiuyd by the
holy ghost / But she failed both speech and voys / which sorrow had taken fro
her^

O verum eloquiu^ iustum simeonis / O ye true word of the very Just Symeon /
For then was your promise fulfilled of the sword of sorow^ when that blessid
virgyne mary was there present. and her sweet sone hanged on the cross / She
lay at the earth as deed pale and dyscolored but her soul lived. as in deye^g
/ And yet was she not deed / but living as a dedely creature the sorrows
tourmented her soul so cruelly / that she desired much more to deye than live
/ For after the death of her sweet child full painfully and dedely lived. she
though she were not utterly dede^ that day was she therein full merueyllous.
sorrow awaytimg when the blessid body of our lord Ihesu christ should be taken
down of the cross. / She wept in saying. and said in weeping Alas alas who
shall yield to me your sorrowful mother the deed bodi of her dear love and
child / O ye cruel Jews / ye have acomplished now your desire Wherefore I
require you take down this holy bodi of the cross / and yield him to his
woeful mother / She being nere to the cross beholding full pyteously her sweet
sone Ih^u there h^a^gyng / then roos she up on her fete / and with full great
pain dressyd her to the cross. where she might best enbrace the blessed body
of Ihesu christ. to whom she had sometime given sowke with her own sweet
breasts / but she might not areche him And then enforced she her with all
her power to stretche her as hye as she might areche to towche some part of
him: wherwyth she oue^^hrewe to the earth. and lay there a great while in
merueyllous sorrows / But yet again the great feruentnesse of love made her to
arise / coueytyng her dear sone: And enforced her with all her power to draw
him to her / But she was so fulfyllid with sorrow / so wey kid and weried
wythinward marterdom. that she cowde not sustain her / but ouerthrewe again to
therth O grave martirium / O frequens suspirium / O languens pectus virgineum
liquefacta est ai^a mea / facies pallet rosea / Sz precioso filii rubet cruore
respersa cadentis fluctus / sanguinis / ore sacro tangebat terram deo^culans /
qua^ cruoris vnda rigabat /

O How grievous marterdome. O how deep and often sighs / O how this virgynal
heart was paynfully tormented And this holy soul that was all dyssoluyd in
sorrow / And this color that before was fresh as the rose / was become so
pyteously pale: And she all bespren clid with the precious blood of her sweet
sone / whereof great plente fylle upon the earth / which she with her holy
mouth kyssed / so entrerly. that she brake the wawes and clotyrs of that
precious blood / towchyng ye earth / so wonderfully was she tormented with
full great sorrows O was not this more like a sorrowful deyeng than a life And
while she was in these torments came a noble man. that was namid Joseph /
which was truly in his heart a discyple to Ih^us / And he went all hardely to
pylate / and axyd the body of Ihesu christ. which was granted to him / Then
took he a another man with him that was called Nychodemus / so came they to
golgatha where our lord was crucyfyed / And brought with them their
Instruments to take out the nails of his hondes and fete. and to take him
down of the cross. And when that blessed vyrgyne saw that they would take him
down / she roos up as well as she might for all her sorrow to help them to
her power That one took out the nails and that other sustained his body that
it should not fall to the earth And his blessid mother took him by the arm.
And as soon as he was taken down / his sweet mother took him in his arms full
sorowfully kyssyng and clyppynge him. so pyteously weeping / that she all to
wette his blessed vysage with her sorrowful teres / And tourme^ted hyrselfe
with many and often sighs / and snobbynges full lamentably complaining /
wryngyng her hondes^ and said / O my sweet sone. why suffryd ye thise felon
Jews to crucifye you. O what sorrow now I your wretchyd mother holds you deed
in my lap. A what shall I sorrowful do now / Alas fair sone alas where is
become that great Joy that I had in your natiuyte / alas now is my Joy changed
/ and turned in to great sorrow / my fair dear child And euyr among she
kyssyd full swetely his blessid vysage with so great plente of sorrowful teres
/ as all her flesh had be molten in teres / And then said she full
piteously to the body of her sone / Say me my right sweet sone Say me mine
oonly sone. the life of my soul My synguler conforte. mine oonly Joy.
Wherefore suffer ye me thus sorowfully to abide after you. Say me my sweet
lord god / wherefore be ye so far from me. A god mercy comfort my soul /
Behold me / and have mercy on me / Now speak who speak will / how great was ye
sorrow that then had the blessed mother of Ihesu christ / Trewly there may no
creature say nor think perfyghtly the gretnes of the sorrow: that this
pyteuous blessid virgyne felt For how be it that she knew well that he was
very god and man and that he should arise again fro death to life the third
day / thus as he said himself / Yet was her love so fervent unto him. that
made her sorrow to pass and excede all other sorrows that ever were /

ANd then^e after she had long continued in this traueylle and tourment with
sorrowful sighs and weeping / then came Joseph and Nychodemus to wrappe up
his blessed body in a clean cloth of sendall. and to lay it in a fair new
sepulcre of stone / Thither came thousand thousands of angels to the
beryenge of their lord / which songen pray singes to almighty god / But marye
his blessed mother gaf hertly sighs and snobbynges. and sorowfully wept by the
sepulcre / This sorrowful mother would have be beryed by her sone / And full
often times by constraynt of love e^braced him and said full pyteously /
Miseremini mei miseremini me / saltem vos amici mei / illu^ adhuc paululu^
relinquite michi / She said to joseph and nychodeme have mercy on me have mercy
on me my fre^des my friends / and let me alityll behold his visage since it is
ouercouerd so so that I may have some comfort / and put him not thus soon
in the sepulcre / But if ye will needs burye him / burye me with him For a
sorrowful life shall I have after him / Then by the most reverend and humble
ways they cowde they did their devour to peasifye her / and laid his blessed
body in the sepulcre / full bytterly weeping all / in such wise that vnethis
any of them might sown a right word And what merueyle was it: They saw his
pyteous mother dyspourueyed of all manner of comfort / which was a great
increasing of their sorrow / And thus the lord of this life was given to the
sepulcre of death: And when he was buried / his blessed mother drew toward him
enbrasyng the sepulture with al her heart so as she might / and callid on
Ihesu christ. and said / Fair sone what shall I do that am your wretchyd mother /
Now might ye say then fair vyrgyne / Anima me liquefacta est / vt dilectus
locutus est. quesiui eum and non inueni illum. vocaui et non respondit michi /

MY sorrowful soul is al dessoluid for anguysshe of mi sweet sone / that
entendeth not to my words / I seek him and I may not find him. I speak to
him / and he answeryth me not Then came saint Ioh^n / to who^ our lord had
deliuerde her in kepi^ge so sore weeping / that in no wise he cowde refreyne
hym^ Then^e took he up this blessed virgyn wepi^ge and snobbing in sorrows. and
so weryed in weeping. and so much greuyd and dyscomforted / that uneaths her
fete might sustain to bear her Notwythsto^dyng thus as she myighte. with the
help of the holy wymen that were there. they all with weeping entryd in to
Iherusalem / many wymen that saw this had such pity of the sorrowful weeping
of the blessed vyrgyn marye that they cowde not refreyne their teres / Her
sorrowful heart and pyteous demeanyng constreyned many a hard heart to weep
and sorrow / and thus was she led al with wepinge unto the house of saint Johan
both hirself weping and all that went with her / and as many as saw her So
rested she and abode in his house: which honored her / served her and louyd
her more than she had be his own mother / And when our lord was buried. the
jews sealid his sepulture / and appointed certain kniigh^tes in harneys for to
keep it / In the mean time the blessid virgyn mary e^dured great sorrow in the
house of saint Johan / For she wept contynually without comfort / for there was
no friend she had might ease her / nor saint Ioh^n himself. for she was always
in sorrow and bitter teres. A who is so encombrid with syn^e / or is somoche
enco^bryd of erthly love / Or who is so fulfyllid of error / or is so
charged with worldly richesse / that has the heart so hard / that they can
not have compasco^n and conpu^ccyon when they read or here of the sighs and
wepynges / the sorrows and torments that this blessid pure vyrgyn saint mary
ye right sweet mother of our lord Ihesu christ suffryd Truly they have the
heart right hard and without mercy / that has not some compasco^n of these
pains / And who that is without mercy and pity. god will have no mercy nor
pity on him / if it be not the gretter merueyle For seldom is the man sauyd
that is without a mercyful heart / whereof saint bernarde says. Nemo duri cordis
salutem vmqua^ adeptus est. nisi forte miseratus deus abstulerat ab eo cor
lapideu^ and dederit ei cor carneum Never man of hard heart purchaced not
thelth of his soul. but perauenture the mercyable god has be pleysed some
time to take from him his heart of stone / and give him a tender heart of flesh
/ whereby he may be sauyd. Nunquid cor durum ipsum quod nec compassione
scinditur. nec pietate mollitur minis non cedit / etc.

IS not this a hard heart that is not meuyd by compasco^n / nor softed by pity
nor makith no force of menaces that can come to him nor other / Nor takyth no
head of counseylle / Nor to no man's Judgment / not to shame nor dispysing /
nor to no manner peril / Is not this man over folisshe in the opinyons of al
reasonable folks / that all things past forgeteth / And necligently uses
those things that been now and takes none head to puruey for such things as
ben for to come But shortly puts all in adventure / This is a hard heart
that another dredeth god / nor beryth reverence to man / And if ye leave not me
ask Pharaon. that had the heart so over hard /

Now fair sweet friend haue^ ye herd that our lord Ihesu christ louyd more his
love / than ever soul louyd body: For he loved her more than his life / when
he gaaf his life and suffryd his glorious soul to depart fro his precious
body for the love of her / that honouryd / praised and thankid be he of al
creatures without end /

THe fourth great love that is in the werld is between man and wife / yet the
wife may be so wretchyd of her body / and so enstrau^ged to her husbonde / that
perauenture though she would retorn^ to him again / he would not receive her /
And this has be often preuyd but the love of our lord Ihesu crist passith all
beyond this love / For never was the soul of his love acompanyed with so
many sins nor so often in a voutre / or other sins / but if she would
return to to him again. he would gladly receive her with great Joy /
Wherefore always be he honored and thankyd. for he is ever ready to them yt will
leave the fend and come to him As himself says by Ieramye the prophete^ Si
dimiserit vir vxorem sua^ / etc. tu autem fornicataes cu^ amatoribus tn^
reuertere ad me dicit dn^s / If a man leuith his wife for any sin / it may
well be for it befalls often. But ye fair love / though ye have offended in
dedely sins innumerable. yet leave not therefore to return to me / and I shall
receive you full swetly and benygnely / And what does more yet this amerous
king. wha^ his love is turned from him / he gooth following and cryenge after
her / like as it is wreten in the book of loue^ Reuertere reuertere suauitatis
/ reuertere reuertere vt intuiamur te.

Return ye. return ye to me ye wretchyd souls / Return ye to the entente
that I may defend you and keep you from your enmyes / that will confound
you. And saint austin says that our lord spekyth this to the sinful soul /
Capud meu^ spictis tenui / manus meas clauis obiecti / lancee latus apperui
sanguinem meu^ fudi vt michi coniungerem te. et tu diuidis te a me. erubesce.
My head and face I held against the foul spyttynges / my hondes I spradde
agayns hard nails / I opened my side agayns the spear / my precious blood I
shed to Join you to me / And would ye then thus depart fro me / Ye ought
full greatly to be ashamed / A good lord mercy what is this / that he sekith
the sinful soul so ententyfly / and callith her so often / like as it is
wreten in the book of love / En ipse erat post parietem nostru^ prospiciens per
cancellos /

Behold how Ihesu Christ was behind ye wall watchynge^ and beholdynge
Inward by the creueces if she would in any wise return to him / And in the
apocalips is said / Ecce ego sto ad hostiu^ and pulso / et si quis apparuerit
michi intrabo ad eu^ etc. See how I am at the door and knock and make noise /
and who yt comes to open his door I shall enter in with him to his comfort As
it is said in the gospel /

Omnes qui laborati et ornati estis / venite ad me et ego reficiam vos / O all
ye that been traueylled in the seruyse of the fend and charged with sin* come
to me and I shall refresshe you and comfort you / And what does he if he sees
you coming toward him to cry him mercy / It is wreten in the gospel.
Occurrens prodigo cecidit super collu^ eius osculatusque est eu^ / etc. When he
sees the soul coming toward him / he spredith his arms to clippe her and
kyssyth her. and makith gretter Joy of her than of many other that were with
him always / as himself says Dico vobis quod ita gaudiu^ est in celo super vno
pcco^re penitencia^ agente / qua^ super nonaginta nouem justice qui non indigent
penitencia. I say you surely that gretter Joy is there in heaven of one oonly
synnar doing his penance / than of nynty and nine rightful. that never had
need to do penance / And yet here a gretter merueyle of the love of Ihesu
christ / For though his love man's soul be never somoche foylid with dedely
sin / yet asson^ as she comith to him he makith her as clean as she was
tofore the sin. and as rich of all wel^es / as saint austyn says / Erant
sicut fuera^t antequa^ proiecera^ eos / They shall be as clean and rich of
good works / and restablisshid in vyrginite of the soul / and if ye will have
an ensample how this may be ye may here by* this. All the sins that is or ever
was may not be do but in three manners / That is to know in thought / in word /
or in work. Now should not this be one of the grettest sins yt a man might
do in thought / to think and desire to destroy al holy church / truly this
same was ye thought and desire of saint poul: as it is wrete^ in actibus
applorum Saulus adhuc spira^s. etc. Saul began furiously tenforce him to ye
destrucco^n of al cristyndo^ with menaces and betynges / and went to
archebysshops and to pryncipal masters of the jews / and gate lettres of the^
to take all cryste^ me^ that he might find wherso ever he came / and bring them
bound and put them in prison And in his chyef auctoryte and malice was he
converted to our lord / And is now a hye saint glorified in heaven with saint
Johan evangelist / and other that were of pure and perfyght life. Also the
grettest sin that man might do with word. should be to renye our lord /
and saint peter renyed h^i^ three times in one night. and when he had thus done
/ he took right hertly repentance /

Exiuit petrus for as et fleuit amare /

He went out and wept full bytterly. and sorowed. cried god mercy / And now
is he senescall of heaven. And the most foul sin of the body is the vile
sin of the flesh / And men would say that he or she should be the gretest
sinner of the world that had accompanied them / not oonly most comunely with
man. but also with fendes. And marye mawdeleyn had them within her / which is
now the dear love of our lord Ih^u Christ / as says saint gregorye / Maria
septem demonia habuit / qui vniuersis viciis plena fuit / Mary had seven fendes
within her / by which she was fulfyllid with all manner of vices / But for all
those evil vices she made a reasonable amendment / as saint gregory says /
Quotquot in se habuit delectamenta. tot de se inuenit holocausta Asmany delites
as she had in her of sins / so many sacrefyces did she upon hyrself / for
amends of her offenses.

NOw retorn^ we to this great love that our lord has showed vs^ whereof he
says yet by Zach^arye. Zelatus sum syon zelo magno / I am Ielous over man's
soul with a great Jealousy / As he says in exodi Ego su^ deus zelotes / I am
god the Ielous / And not allonly was he Ielous of the good. but to make peace
with theuyll / as dauyd says Zelaui super iniquos pace^ pcco^ru^ videns / I
have desired by great Jealousy to have pees with evil folks / so says he to
saint peter in ye sawter / Tabescere me fecit zelus meus / My Jealousy has
caused me to suffer death / and yet mine enmyes have forgoten my words. so
that they will in no wise grant me their love for all that I have do for
them / And yet again says our lord Ih^u christ ye shall not escape me / but
that ye shall grant me your love / I ask ye whether it be to be given / or to
be sold / or to be taken with force / If it be to be given. to whom may ye
better give it than to me that pass all me^ that ever were and am fairest of
all other. He is so fair yt if a man were in hell and might see his visage
and beauty of his diuynyte / he should feel another harm^ ne pain / And therefore
says he where may ye better set your love than on me / Am not I the king of
all kyngis / am I not more fair than other / nor am I not of more hie lignage
than any prince. Am I not more wise than all other / and am I not of al folk
most curteys / and of al thing most large and free / and am I not of all
other the most sweet and debonayr Then is there none exscuse* sith that ye
may find in me all the causes of reason / wherefor man should give his love /
and namely if ye have clennesse and chastyte / For none may love a right but
they be clean fro dedely sin: Now and ye will not give your love. I will byr
it / will ye selle it for mi love / or for any other thing / It is most
reasonable marchandyse. love for love / And if it be to selle for that price / I
have truly boughte it with a another love / And that love that I have showed you
passes all the louys of the world And though they were al togider yet is it
gretter^ And if ye say that ye will not give it me so good chepe / name how
much ye will haue^ And ye can not name somoche but I will give you asmoche.
Will ye castelles / will ye reames / Or will ye ask all the world / Yet shall
I make you a better covenant / give me your love and I shall crown you in
heaven / and make you seven times more clear then is the son / Nor neuyr
harm shall towche you: nor neuyr thing shall grieve you / nor no well shall
fail you^ But all your will shall be done in heaven in earth and in hell For
never man^ys wit may deuyse / nor heart think the Joy and the glory that I
will give you for your love without any comparyson. without any rekenyng and
without any end more and more. And much more with all the gladness of Estre*
all the beauty of absolon. as often as he did clippe his head / he might selle
the here that was kytte of for ijCC siclis of silver. The swyftnes of Asaell yt
would strive with the hertes in re^nyng. The strength of Sampson that slew at
one time a thousand men in battle / The largeness of cezar / The renomme of
alexandre the holiness of moses But good lord mercy would not a man give all
worldly goods for one of these graces / And all thise together in comparison of
the soul is as no thing. Wherefore if ye be so enraged and so froward that
ye refuse so great again as I offer you / Then^e take heed to the third that I
will have it by force / or at your peril / For I hold ready the sword of
cruel vengau^ce over you to slay you with cruel death. and depart body and
soul / and put them to perdyco^n and to confou^de them both in hell. for to
be tormented with fendes sorowfully anguysshously and contynuelly without e^de.
Answer now if ye will defend you against me if ye can or may / or else grant
me your love yt I desire with so great Jealousy and with so fervent heart / and
not for my well but for yours Now take good head to thise words of Ihesu christ
/ Is not she of over hard heart that to such a savior will not grant her
love / If she remembered well these three things / what he is / and how great is
the love of so hye a lord as he is. and so vile and so simple as she is.
she should do her devour to love him / though she should a hundred times
suffer death for the love of him / whereof saint bernarde says / Quomodo e^
istud sine modo a nobis deus amari meruit qui prior nos dilexit tantus. and
tantu^ gratis / tantillos and tales miseros /

IN what manner is this^ and above al manner that can be devised by all erthly
wits that our lord Ihesu christ deseruyd to be beloved / for that he louyd us
first / and loves us somoche without our deserte which is so simple and
such wretches as we ben / And as saint bernarde says / Omne tempus in quo de
deo non cogitas hoc te perdidisse computa / All the time in which ye think
not on god / reken it as lost. For therefore be we called christian. to serve
christ and to remember of his sorrowful pains that he suffryd for our love /
And surely if we will not often think on his pains / we shall receive over
grievous vengaunce And to us shall be rekenyd the death of our lord Ihesu christ
/ whereof saint bernarde pleyneth him in saying / Quamdiu vixero ero me mor
laboris que^ cristus sustinuit in predicando / fatigacionu^ in discurrendo
temptacionu^ in ieiunando / vigiliaru^ in orando / lacrimaru^ in compaciendo.
etc. As long as I shall be in this lif I shall remember me full pyteously of
the grievous labors that our lord Ih^u criste suffryd in prechyng. and of the
werynesse in his gooynge about. and of his temptacyons / in fasting of his
watch in prayer / and of the teres that he wept by compassion I shall remember
also his sorrows / and his dispisyng with shamful spittynges and the hard
strokes that they laid upon him / and the felon repreues that he suffryd. And
the great nails / and al these other passions that he suffryd for me / And if
I do it not / there shall be cast on me to my confusion the In^ocent blood
that ihesu christ shed upon the earth for me. Do we then / do we by the
counsel of saint bernarde / and by the counseylle of king dauyd / that says
in the sawter Sepcies in die laudem dixi tibi / Fair lord god seven times in
the day I yield to the thankynges and praysynges for our benefactours and
benefaytes / And for this reason ben vij hours of the of the day commanded to
say in holy church. in remembrance of the pascyon of our lord Ihesu christ.
For this that at every hour suffryd he so much shame. Thise vij hours ben
called / compline. matynes / pryme. tyerce. myddy / noone. and vespres. When ye
say or here co^pline. think full ententyfly how at that our Judas betrayed
him and sold him for xxx. pens / so good chepe was never seen sold nor
bought so delicyous and precious flesh / And well may this time be callid
complyne for this that our lord would soon after pass from this paynful life
/ The which death was purposed of the felon Jews that he should not escape For
it was of him / as of a man condemned to deye for theft / and is delyuerd to
his execuco^n / of whom men sayen though he be yet living. he is as a deed man
/ for cause he is Iuged to the death / This theft wherefore Ihesu christ was
conde^pnyd / was not for gold nor silver / but for an apple that was full
bitter / as we have hard that adam stale in paradise / where he did sacrelage
/ whereby he was acursid out of holy church payned in this mortal life
sorowfully ixC years and more / tormented in hungre and thurst in great labor
and anguysshe / and since deyed of right paynfull death / And his soul decended
unto the horrible pains of hell / and lay there bound in prison and
derknesse xl^C years and more / so that he and al his lignage that deyed went
thither to the time that our lord Ihesus christ shed his precious blood on the
holy cross /

This ought ye to think wha^ ye say or here complin / and have full great fere
of our lord / whom ye have so often offended. when he took so great and
grievous vengau^ce of adam that he had made with his own hondes for one apple /
that was of no value yt he took against his co^maundeme^te. And therefore at
that hour yield w^ culpable to god within our hertes^ and to the priest with
our mouth / And if ye may then have in mind all that ye have done that day
against the commandment of god ^ of all that ye have evil spoken with your
mouth / and with your eyes evil beholden and often. and of all yt we can think
that day we have done against the will of our creator / and devoutly require
merci and pardon / And this hour was concluded felonously the death of Ih^u
christ for our sins / And have very hope that we shall have this yt we desire /
if we repent ourself truly. and be well confessyd. so that our axynge be
reasonable / For this says our lord in the gospel / Pette et accipietis /

Require and ye shall receive after this complyne / He said to his three
dyscyples full pyteously / fair brethern abide and wake here while I make my
prayers to my fader. Then fylle he down to the earth / and prayed three times
his fader that if it miight be his passion were put from him: And then
appeared an angel to him and conforted him / whereof ye ought to think / that
as long as he was in his prayer / he swet drops of blood / In the mean time
slepte his discyples / but himself had no will to sleep / to the time that he
deyed on the cross / and then^e rested he in the sepulture unto the day of
his Resurrexcion / and then awaked he thus as a man slepyng hastly awaketh
thus / soon and sooner awoke he fro death. whereof dauyd the prophet says /
Excitatus est tanquam dormi ens dn^s. At matynes yield we thankynges to our
lord Ihesu criste and specially in the night / for this that at such hour /
was he for us taken within a gardyne by the treyson of Judas his discyple.
After tormented and dyspoyllid. beten: bouffeted / and fasly accused / And with
their foul spetyll foylled / of all his dyscyples left / and of his appostles
refusid for their lord / and all this nygh^te vylaynously and cruelly without
any mercy drawn with paynfull torment Thise were his matynes of hard lessons
/ Who these things truly byleueth / understands. and has in remembrance by
holy deuoco^n / and yeldeth thankynges to him that this suffryd / he singyth
his matynes spirituelly At matynes when we rise and think to say matynes / Or
when we here other say them. or if we lie in our beds wakyng about mydnyght
/ we may think and take ensample of the great passion of Ih^u christ / and how
mekely he suffryd at that hour of the night / if we be in any trybulacyon or
aduersitee either bodily or goostly the remembrance of his meke suffraunce
then should be to us great comfort / And at the hour of prime should we
yield thankynges to our lord / For at that h^ur was he shamfully bound as a
thief. and brought to the court before pylate / and deliuerde him to be Iuged:
At that hour brought Judas again to the court the xxx. pens that he had
received for his great treison / and in contyne^t hyng himself for sorrow and
dyspeyre / And at that same hour was our lord acused to pylate of three things
/ First said they full falsely / that he had defended that no man should pay
no truage to Cezar of his erthly reame / For asyd not he to the people / that
he would be their king erthly / But he said that his own reame was not
te^porall / but perpetuell that never shall have end. And after they accused
him that he should say / and that was truth that he was the very sone of god
/ And at this hour was he sent^ by pilate to herode^ where he would not speak
one word. wherefore they held him for a fool and out of his wit / And made
him to be clothyd in white as a fool. and so sent him again to pylate / and
after that was herod and pylate acorded that had be long before at debate /
At the hour of tyerce yield we thankynges to our lord Ihesu christ. For at
that hour cried the jews against him. Crucyfie him crucifye him / At that hour
was he put out as a thief / whiles that they yielded the sentence of his
pardico^n and yaf his Judgment / At this hour sent pylates wife to her husbonde
/ yt he should meddle no more with Ihesu christ / And this was by the entysinge of
the fend / that by a woman put us all to dampnacyon. and by a woman would have
dystourned our redempco^n / wenyng to have overthrown us in perdurable
perdyco^n / But by the sweet vyrgine mary god sent our saluaco^n / so that the
felons might not follow the fendes presumpcyon / At this hour wysshe pylate his
hondes / and would no more entermente with Ihesu christ. By this went he to
have made him clean. that he should not have be gylty thereof / At this same hour
was our lord bound to the pyle^ all nakyd. And was so long bete^ with
scorges / yt there was no place of his body / but it was paynfully bledynge
from his head unto his fete / His flessh^ was all steyned with his precious
blood And so largeli the blood ran^e out of his tender body that long time
after aperyd it on the pyler whereto he was bound and beten / At this hour
they clothyd him in a mantel of purple ^ And at this hour they put a crown of
thorns upon his head painfully prickyng him / and deliuerd him a read in his
hand as a great staff / and since knelyng in scorn salewed him saying / Heyle
king of Jews. and therwyth gave him a great stroke upon the face^ And when
they had thus mockyd him and beten him / they took of his mantell of purple /
and clothid him in his own clothes again and led him forth to the mount of
caluarye. And made him bear his own cross whereon he should deye. At that hour
came his blessed mother with other wymmen following after him full pyteously
wepinge / Also these shames and many mo pains suffryd he between thour of
tyerce and myddy for our wretchyd souls /

AT the hour of mydy yield we thankynges to our lord ihesu crist / For at
that hour spredde he his sweet body upon the cross / and his hondes and fete
were fastnyd with three great nails This cross was made of iiij manner of wodes
/ The wode that went the length of the cross was of sidyr / the piece that
went overthwart was of appultree / and the tabyl above wherein was wreten in
ebrew in grew / and in latyne / Ihesus nazarenus rex iudeoru^. that was of
olif That same underneath that bare and sustained all the remenau^t was of
sipres At that hour required our lord Ihesu christ his fader right pyteously to
pardon those tormentours his death / for all the pains that they did him. At
that hour divided they his ouergarmente but his cote abode all hole / At that
hour mockid they him that passed by the way. At that same hour promised he to
the thief paradyce:

And that same hour deliuerde he his dear mother to saint John evangelist in
keeping / And from that same hour beca^m the son^e derke unto hye none. and lost
his virtue and clernesse / At the hour of none yield we thankynges to our lord
/ for at ye hour he raised a great cry upon the cross / where ash heng and
said in ebrewe / Heloy heloy lamazaba tani / My god my god wherefore have ye
left me and forsaken me. This said he not for this that he was left of his
fader / for that is not to be byleued / but for that he was left at this hour
of all the world: sauf of his mother and one oonly thief that in his great pain
byleued on him At this hour pleyned him the same that was well and spring of
life / that he had thurst. and they offrid him eysel and galle / to thentent
that he should dey more sooner. but he would not drink thereof / after that he
had tasted it / And then was done all that was to be done before his death /
and then was al accomplisshed that a thousand year before was of his passion
spoken by the holy ghost and said in prophecye / whereof our lord Ih^u christ
himself said at this hour / Consu^matu^ est / This is to say / it is fulfilled
And then said he all in cryenge / In manus tuas dn^e co^mendo sp^m meu^ / And
yielded his spirit and deyed ye same that us yeuyth and susteineth our life / at
this same hour cloue the hard stones / therth and the montayns / And the
sepulcres of deed bodies opened / The veyle of ye temple claf in the mids /
And for these merueyles and many other that befell at that time. Centuryo and
al other that kept that blessid body that henge there on the cross dredde
them saying. This is truli the sone of god At ye same hour brake they the
thies of the two thieves that henge on each side of our lord Ihesu christ. And
at that hour a blind knight with a sharp spear percyd him through his tender
flesh and side unto the heart. to know if he were perfyghtly deed And then
ran^e from his heart blood and water / for to wasshe us from the fylth of
sin. And of that blood ran^e down by the spear to the hand of longeus
wherwyth he wyped his eyes. and forth with received his sight / And that hour
was saint Johan and all his other discyples and friends departed from him /
sauf ye tender virgyn mary his sorrowful mother / that abode there allone among
the deed thieves with the blessid body of her sone / At the hour of euensonge
yield we thankynges to our lorde^ for at this hour came Joseph abaremathye and
nychodemus yt often had lodged our lord / and was not consenti^g to his death.
and had gotten leave of pylate to take down the body of Ih^us / and so he and
Nychodemus did. And anointed it with myrre / And wrapped it in a fair clean
clothe / and laid it in ye sepulcre And also at that hour his mother / and his
other friends that then were returned made full sorrowful compleynt for him /
And after that as some say was Joseph abaromathye taken and put in prison by
the Jews And the third day made our lord his resurrexco^n. after his pyteous
and paynfull death that he suffryd for us syn^ars Whereof he be honored and
thankyd without end. And for this that we have often and many times offended
against that great love that he has showed us. and daily shows us we ought
devoutly to pray and serve him / not oonly seven times of the day / but fro
the beginning of our life unto the end: to praise him to gloryfye his name /
and his passion to remember / And thus says dauyd A solis ortu vsque ad
occasu^ laudabile nomen dn^i / Amen

Here ends the lamentaco^n of our lady / which she had in ye passion of our
savior /
Here begins a treatise much profitable for reformaco^n of souls
defoyled with any of the vij dedely sins /
TO his rih^t dear suster salute and health of soul and of body in hi^. that
is true savior In whom is always charity. pacyence and chastyte. which in
troth defends us fro evil dooyng and meuyth us to the holy trynite / this he
grant us by his holy pity / the sweet Ihesus christ / of whom as much more as
man understands and says of his merueylous godenes / so much more loves
he and has Joy in him for spyrituell Joy comyth of the love of our lord the
right sweet Ihesus / And the very sign of love is to think often on him.
Wherefore remember you often of the humilite of his Incarnaco^n / of ye goodness of
his conuersaco^n / and of the charytee of his passion: And who well remember
these may find sure medycyne against every dedely sin and temptaco^n / First
who that entendeth to be proud / bethynke him of the great humylite of our
lord Ihesu christ. which is so great that heaven and earth may not
comprehend him / And by his mekenes list to close him within the womb of a
maid. Thus was the sone of god ensample of humylite and medycyne of pride / as
saint austyn says / for he has showed to^ us mekenes in all his works / For
he would have an humble mother the blessed vyrgyne marye / and an humble house
where he was borne / which was called a dyuersorye and so humble a bed / as
the manger for bestes And when he came to the age of xij. year / by his mekenes
he was obedyent to Joseph and to his blessed mother as it is showed in ye
gospel and when he came to more age he choos meke persons / as saint peter
and saint andrew / poor meke fisshars with other such to be in his company. in
token that what man or woman that would be with him in his perdurable Joy / it
behooves he^ to be humble / and meke as saint austi^ says By the humylite of
Ih^u criste ye may come to the Joy perdurable / For in asmoche as Ih^u criste
is king of that country whether we entende to goo / And for asmoche as he is
man: he is sure way whereby we shall goo / for he is our example / so as he
says in the gospel I have given you ensample of humylite Now may the proud
folk understand that they may goo by none other way but by Ih^u christ this
is by the way of meekness / For as saint James says. For god resists to
the hie and proud folks. and to the humble he gyueth^ his grace / They ben
humble that can mark there own proper defawtes and hold theymself for foles
and wretches. For the more they disprayse theymselfe / the more largely shall
they have ye grace of our lord* wherefor it is said in scripture / The gretter
that ye be in auctoryte: the more humble should ye be in your heart in word /
and in work / And then shall ye find grace at our lord / and after the Joy
with^out end. Which us grant the sweet Ih^u christ that somoche louyth
humylite / Against the sin of Envy

WHo should rejoice the hurt of other / or be sorry of ye well of other / as
enuyous folk done / if they behold by the eye of ferme faith / how great
charity the sweet Ih^u very god and man showed us / not for his well / but for
ye well of other / when he so dear boughte us from thinfernal prison / which
was with no lityll raunson: when he gaaf himself for our salvation / and all
this made charity For he reioyseth the well of other And the sorrow of other was
more paynful to him than his own which^e showed well by his most pyteous and
paynfull death that ever man suffered in earth. for the releef and comfort of
other. This charity was the gift that he left with his discyples at his
departing. as he says in the gospel / By this shall all folks know if ye ben
truly my dysciples / for then shall ye have truly charity / and love among
you

Now dear suster remember well what mark he sets upon al his Wherefore if ye
will be one of his ye must be of that mark / as would our lord I were one of
the leest of theim^ For god is ordener of love / And in love restyth himself
so as saint Ioh^n says. Deus caritas est. etc. Now take good head by these
ensamples that be so open how good a thing is humylite of heart with true love
of Ih^u christ / For there is no thing under heaven that he loves somoche / and
if ye have that ye shall have all weles and god himself. And if ye fail that
ye shall fail all that may torn to your well / and as saint poul says / Know
ye not well that where many folks fight together in great oostes. that thoos yt
hold them ferme together may not lightly be. dyscomfyted in no wise And so
is it of the spyrituell battle against the fend. for he does all his force
to dysceue and depart our hertes / and to take fro us true love and charity /
And as soon as the hertes ben therfro departed / the fend enters and sleeth on
every part For where a man gooth alone in a cumbrous way and stumblith
comunely he falls / But and there were many together / every one might help
other. For if one stumble / a another is ready to hold him up or he fall /.
And if one of them wexe weary. his felawe will help to lead him.

This temptaco^n is stumbling that makyth many to fall in the mire of sin:
if he be not sustained by other with true charity / and so says saint
gregorye. By these ensamples appears it then / that who that is bounde^ with
other in true charity / and love has a mighty help against temptaco^n / And
who that is vnbou^de by hatrede sone stynkith and ouerthroweth^ Behold well
then^e how much is worth the alyaunce of true charity and love / that al good
and godenes holds together / so that none may perysshe that has that / Much
loves us our sweet lord Ih^us / and claymeth of us none other reward / but to
love him again / and this should no man deny / for always he may find matter
enough in his heart if he enserche well / In good hour are they born that can
love hi^ aryght. which almighty god grant us so to do by his holy pity

WHo should be inpaceint with any thing / or keep wrath in his heart / that
beholds ye pacyence that our sweet lord Ih^u christ had in all his life / Three
degrees ben there in pacyence. The first is hye. that is when ye suffer humbly
for your own gylti / The second more hye / if ye suffer humbly without your
desert / The third is best and most high / if ye suffer pain humbly^ for
your good deed. For though we suffer harm for our deserte / we may not with
Right complain us / Now full vnhappi and unwise were he that would rather
chose to be fellow of Judas / than the fellow of Ihesu christ / and yet both
two were hanged on the tree. Judas for his deserte / And Ih^u without deserte
For his great bounte was cruelly hanged on the cross By this may ye take
ensample that what man that wrongeth you or hurts you in word or deed is
your light It gives you clernes / and takith fro you the cloud of sin /
But is not this evil that man torneth to derknesse / this that should be his
lyight / so that it makyth him much more derke / as when a man has
trybulacyon or aduersite and takyth it impacyently / he does against nature and
as evil metal / For that thing derkyth him that of his nature should give him
light and cleernes. Wherefore my dear suster think on the pacyence of Ih^u /
and of the Remedies against wrath / That one remedy is to answer ^ebonay^ly to
the angry. For Salamon sayth^ fair answer refreyneth Ire. The second is
scylence / when mouth is stylle the fire que^cheth / and the hete aswageth /
then ben they stylle fro chiding / And therefore says saint poul to the
Irous folk hold your peace. and speak not to the wrathful / The third is to
behold to our own proper defautes / for a man in that is more apt to
perceive ye fawtes of other than of himself / And salamon says the pour man
that has defawt of gods he is mesurable to other / this is to say / a man
that perceyueth himself disposed to wrath / and felith in hi^ many defawtes of
i^pacye^ce / he forbereth and suffers much more other with gretter pacye^ce
But he yt can perceive no defawte in himself lightly is wroth with other: The
fourth is to behold in what condyco^n the wrathful is / for the wise man
callith wrath a lityl woodnes And then a man that is wroth semyth as out of
his wit / and to a mad man is folly to answer / For the Irous man that is
ready to say evil and curse may uneath suffer any man or woman to be in the
house in rest with him / he makyth so much chidyng. Whereof the gospel says
vj.M. fendes vj.C.lx. and vj. were entered by that syn^e in to one man / and
never one of them departed from other / for this the wrathful has the
cursinge of our lorde^ and the peasible and pacyente of meke heart has his
blessing Whereof he says in the gospel / blesyd be the peasible / for they
shall be callid the chyldern of god: And to the contrary / unhappy be they
wrathful / for they shall be called the chyldern of the fend / Wherefore good
suster remember often the pacyence of Ihesu christ / and of all his blessed
apostles. marters. confessors and virgyns / how great anguysshe and pain they
suffryd with patience for to have the Joy perdurable. Whereof says saint poul
/ by mani trybulacions behooves us to enter into the reygne of god: Now take
good head how those that been pacyent. peasible / and debonayr ben well by loved
with the sweet Ihesu. Now ye know well when dear friends depart asondre / the
last words yt they speak at their departing is best remembryd: And among the
last words that our lord said when he ascended to heaven / and left his dear
friends in a strange country were of swetnes and of peace / for thus said he to
theim^ peace be among you / my peace give I to you / This peace grant us Ih^u
christ by paeyence in heart / In meekness by word / And in deed by
debonayrtee.

WHo is it yt by slouthe should leave to learn. or to labor to do well. that
behold by true faith how Ihesu christ was in earth. in gooyng. in prechynge /
and in all well dooyng /

After all this behold how in the end of his life he was trauelyd / when he
prayed so that with his swette ran from him drops of blood ren^yng down on
his blessid body to therthe / And after behold when he was at the pyler^ how
sorowfully he was scorged of the felon Jews not oonly on his legs but
ouerall his fair body / And at the last behold how he upon the hard cross
was sore traueylled the day of his letyng blood. Where other folks take rest
and eschew the light / and keep them cloos in their cha^bers when they ben
let blod of any vein / But our blessed lord Ihesu criste vent upon the mount
of caluarie / and yet more on the cross / and was let blood in v places with
wounds large and deep and in the veins capytall / for he was let blood in
his head and in many places / Than who by the eye of true faith behold well
this traueyle of Ihesu christ would Ioyefully traueyle for his love / and never
would be idle. so as says saint Iherom / For by sloth comyth many euylles /
and therefore says an holy fader / Do always well that ye be not found Idle
of the fend. whereby he may te^pte you A another medycyne against spirytuell
sloth is in the hope and comfor to of everlasting Joy: And this may a man
have by holy medytacion of the passion of the sweet Ihesu christ and of his Joy
of heaven. And thise medytaco^ns comen often by good lessons / herd of other
folk. or by redyng theymself that makyth man and woman fermly to trust in god.
and for no sin to be in dyspaire of his mercy / for thus says saint
b^^narde / I have sinned greatly wherwyth my conscience is trowblid / but for
this I dyspayre not for I shall think of the wounds of our lord that he
suffryd for syn^ars. And then can^ I not be afraid for no syn^e that I have
done in time paste but that I shall be sauid / if I have grace to come with
repentance to the mercy of our lorde^ A another remedy there is against sloth
/ and against every evil. and a mean to purchase every well / This is oryson /
and therefore the fend dredeth much ye charytable prayer / for this cause ye
prayer enters somoche in the court of ihesu christ against the fend that it
does two thi^gis / It byndeth him and brenneth him / We read that a holy man
was in his prayers / and the fend came fleyng over him in the air / and
should pass toward the occydent. by the commandment of Julian the emperor
of Rome. And there became he so fast bound by the prayers of the holy man
that to him ascended as wings mou^tynge toward heaven. that in no wise he
might remeue by ye space of x. days enteerly / And of a another fend read we
in the life of saint bertylmew / yt as he was in his prayers. the fend said to
him. great pane have I with you / for your prayers brenne me sore / And for
this I pray you good suster that ye often remember thise things / and thennel
shall ye have the joy of heaven yt shall be given to them that t^aueylle for our
lord Ihesu christ / So as he himself says in the gospel / call says he the
laborers and give them their hire: that is the Joy of heaven

WHo sheld be coueytous or scarce / as ben they that will for the purchasyng
and receyuyng of erthly weles trespace aye^ste god / if they behold by true
faith the great pouertee that was in the sweet Ihesu: that contained fro the
beginning of his life more and more unto the end / For at the first time wha^.
the king was borne that made both heaven and earth / he had not so much place
on all the earth upon which his lityl body might rest / And therefore his
piteous mother wrapped him in pour clothes and laid him in a manger betwyx an
ox and an ass / As it is said in the gospel / Yet after this was he more
pour / so as he himself said that he had not so much place whereon he might
rest his head / so pour was he of erthly loggyng / But yet follows a greter
pouerte / for the ki^ge of glory was dyspoyled. and a^^e nakyd put upon the
cross. And yet what is more merueile / that of all the large earth and broad
might he not have space to lay his body to deye upon. For the cross was not
of bread past a fo^e / or lityll more This was a thing of great merueyle. that
he that was almighty in heaven and in earth / would wylfully be so pour as I
have here before touchid Then^e unhappy ben they that ouermoche desyren erthly
goods and love and honor of this world Whereof saint poul spekyth sore ayenste
and says in this wise. It is not evil to have them / but rather it is evil to
love them / For the rych^esse of this world is but thing that gooth and
comyth. And therefore who that has richesse and loves it becomes pour / and
they that have riches and loves pouerte is rich / For these rich folks that
ouermoche loue^ this world have the curse of god so as he says in the
gospel / Cursed be ye rich folks that have your comfort in your riches. But
to them that lityll love it has he given his blessyng and the Joy perdurable
/ and thus says he in the gospel Blessed be the poor. for theyrs shall be
the reame of heaven. This grant us the sweet Ihesus that so much louyd
pouertee^

WHo should ete ouermoche by will or custom or drink / whereby that the
naturel forces of the soul or body should be destourbed / so that they may
not do thoffice that they are ordained to / Such that been thus accustomed ben
the glotons that are often grutchyng for mete and drink / But who that by true
faith be hold well the pour petaunce that our lord Ihesu christ had the day
yt he was let blood on the cross they should have lityll appetyte to that
glotenie / There ben two manner of folks that have great need of good / and
comfortable metes / this is to know. they that traueyle / and they yt blede.
And the day of his passion our lord was both in hard traueyle and bledyng.
and his pour petau^ce was then^e but a draught of eysell and galle / as the
gospel shows. who then should grutche for defawte though he have sometime
not plente at his will of mete or drink. for the servant ought not to be
better seruid than his lord / whereof our lord spekith by Ieramye / Remember
you said he that have so much trespased of my great pouerte. and of the
bytternesse of the eysell and galle that was given to me to drink: and yet had
I no thing trespased. Alas wretches that we ben / For truly if we thought of
this great defawte we should be content with lityll / and furnyssh^ penance
with abstinence. and help those me^bres of our lord that have great defawte /
which ben the pour nedy / But it is great merueyle yt thise rych^e men have
not great remorse of conscye^ce to think how they wythdrawe from the mouth of
god in the pour / and give it to the chyldern of the fend / as to thise
mynstrelles and triflers / glotons and unthriftiness / and done against the
commandment of our lord Ihesu christ / and to the reryll of her soules^ For
the book says / for the commandment of god receive the pour. which is to
mean to help them after your power / And if ye may not / yet have compasco^n
on theym^ and be of good will to help them / and god will reward you. And
saint austin says the rich be made to help the pour / and the pour to pray
for the rich. and god will give to each of them richesse and Joy without
end The which Joy us grant the sweet Ihesus that fastyd xl^ days in earth.

Against lecherye is to be noted the clen^esse of the pure vyrgyn mary / for he
should be over vile of his body that by true faith behold the clean birth of
Ihesu christ and of his rih^t clean and pure mother the blessed vyrgyn saint mary
and the clen^esse of the lif that they led in earth / and all theyrs / And on
that other party how shamfully evil and unclean is that vile sin / they
should hate it with all their hertes. and flee it as the death / if they were
not out of their wits or of such frowardness that they raughte not of their
dampnaco^n.

For we read in genesis that god for that vile shamfull sin dystroyed all the
world by the floode For it rayned xl days and xl nyghtes / And this wate^ was
so hye that it was above the highest mountayn in earth xv cubytes^ which^e
drowned al folks and bestes and fowls in the world / saving noe and his wife
/ his three sons and their iij. wives / And those bestes and fowls yt were
saved in the same arc. the which water roos so hye over al earth. to wasshe
away the filth and foilyng of that vile sin of lecherye And as hye shall rise
the fire before the day of Judgment to purge the earth of sin. as a wise
fader says / A how unclean a thing and vile is that foul sin of lecherye /
which foyleth not oonly therthe / But the air. the which fylthe to wasshe
away suffyseth not all the water that was in earth but that god sent fro heaven
Rain xl days and xl nyghtes / And for si^ple fornycaco^n that the folk of
israhel did with the women of madyan read we that there were slay of them in
one day by the com^aundement of moses xxiij thousa^de men / And saint poul
witnesses. And for the auoutrye that the folk of gaba did one night in the
rauysshyng the wife of a man were slain lx. and v.M. men / And for that vile
and sha^full sin a aye^ste nature god dystroyed v. cytees For it reigned upon
sodom and gomore stynkyng sulphur and bren^ynge fire / and ouerthrewe the
cytees and all the reame about / And all tho that enhabyted in the cytees /
and all the things growenge in that land / And this was done in sign that
god took no vengaunce upon the sinners oonly / but on the place where they
enhabyted / and of all the place about them that either vsid it or knew it.
and might amend them and would not And know well that in all manners / ye
any man or woman procures or assenteth thereto out of marriage / it is dedely
sin. and one of ye gretest sins that is / For saint austin says in the
decre / Auoutry is gretter sin than fornycacyon / and woors and more vile is
a man to sin with his own mother then with a another woman / But over evil and
abhomynable is it of the sin against nature / and the leest of all out of
marriage is da^pnable Wherefore ye wretches that follow so the vise desires of
your flessh^. bethink ye and repent you And remember how grievous is this vile
syn^e of lecherye. And thereof says saint Ioh^n in thapocalipsis / ye vicyous
wretches and auouterers / that will not leave their sin shall be payned
perdurably in a lake of stynkyng sulphur and brennyng fire. for this that they
ben now so brennyng in the foul desire of their wretchid flessh^ before god
and his angels / and all good folks / But yet the mercy of our lord is so
great / yt when the wretchid man or woman repe^teth hem of her sins / have
they ever somoche offended in any syn^e what so ever it be / so that they keep
hem clean forth in body and heart shall goo to the Joy perdurable where they
shall see Ih^u christ ye fader and the holy ghost. so as says ye gospel /
Blessed be the clean of heart: for they shall see god / and sweet ihesu the sone
of marye / and all the holy company of heaven / My dear suster there I trust we
shall be together both body and soul at the great day of Judgment And this
grant us almighti god of his Infinite mercy / Amen / And all ye that read or
here this. pray ye for him that made it / and for them that wrote it: and for
her that was the cause that it was made / and of your charity for them that
translated it / and wrote it out of frenssh^ in to e^glissh^ / one pater noster
and one auee / that god have mercy on us. and that we may come to him after
this mortal life in to the everlasting life without departing / Amen /

AS wise folks sayen there ben three signs of very love and frenshyp / One is
a person will be glad to speak well of whom they love best. A another they
will be glad to here often well and good tidings of them / The third they
have them somoche in their remembrance* that at sometime all other thing is
forgoten. but oonly the same thing that they love best / And this is the most
sure and true sign of all other / and most to be preysed. And this did saint
Frau^ceys / of whom pope gregory wytnessith by his bull / yt he saw often with
his eyes / that when men named the name of ihesu before saint fraunceys / he
was so rauysshyd with that blessid name. that he had another the herynge nor
the sight of any person or thing that was done about him for a time. And
thus my right dear suster for gods sake over all thing love ye him^ and do
your true devour to win the special favor and grace of him that so hiely
will marye his lovers. As well preuyd it saint Katheryne and saint an^es and
hold ye then this manner to think what a love the sweet Ih^s is^ Think
first how by naturell reason ye be most beholden to love them that most has
given you and most has done for you with out any deserte of you and without
any reward of you / For all ye good and weles that is in you / ye have received
of him. Then she wit well that above all other ye ought to love him with all
your heart / and with all your power / For after ye great weles and bountees
that ye have received of him / so ought your love to be great toward him /
and this says himself by the prophet Ysaye / I have no desire of gold nor
silver / nor other tresour. but only of the faithful love of man or woman /
Now bethynke you well then dear suster where may ye better give your heart and
love tha^ to him / Wherefore to remember you every day if ye have leyser. what
ben ye weles that ye have received of god without your deserte / and say or
think in this manner / My lord god I understand well that ye of your grace
has made me of no thing / and given me being among your creatures / and truly
wha^ I was no thing. I might no thing deserve / Then^e all this that I am
and have / I have received of your special gift and grace without my deserte
/ And of your creatures there ben some hyer and some lower / And I know well
that ye might have made me the most vile creature that is / and this did ye
not But of your bountee fourmed me to be among the most hie creatures that is
/ this is to know angel and man that in your own liknesse shall see you in
your glory. And this dignyte have ye given me without my deserte / if I lose
it not by my defawte^ And by this reason mercyful lord am I enteerly bound
soueraynly to love you / with all my soul with all my heart / and with all my
power /

Then after think again yet. Lord among thise creatures^ angel and man.
there ben some of one part and some of a another. For some of them for their
sin fylle in to hell / And ye all pyteous hye king of heaven descended from
your hye throne in to your lityll preuy chamber. this was the womb of the
blessid virgyne / when of her it pleysed you humbli to be born / and to receive
the humayn flessh^ / to suffer death for the redempco^n of all mankind. whereof
all be not parteners / but such as be christian and live well thereafter / and dey
in ye right faith / But other may not claim that. as Jews and sarrazins and
all other mescreauntes and untrue christian And good lord ye miyghte have let
me deye without baptesme / and then had I be cast with them in to hell
without end / But this did ye not. but made me partener of your redempco^n by
the grace that ye have given me to receive baptesme whereby ye deliuerde me fro
the snare of perdurable death / And yet had I then^e no thank to yield you.
nor naught have deserved of on well or grace no more than they that deyed
vncrystned: and descended in to hell without recover / o merciful lord Ih^u
how much am I bounden by this reason over all thing to give you that poor
love that can come of me / And after this think further of tho that been
crystened how some of them ben naturell fools and without understanding. and
how god has given you without your deserte reasonable understanding Also in
like wise some of hem ben lepers deef / and dombe / and full of other foul
siknesses. or lame or difformed / And ye have received of god without your
desert your naturel health and right shape. whereof hu^bli thank him. And think
then ferder that some there be that have their health and well formed and
reasonable understanding. and yet all the days of their lif live in great
pouerte and labor for their mete / drink and clothes / and yet have thereof
full scarce sustenau^ce / And all otherwise has our lord pourueyed for you /
for to have delicyous metes and of all other sustenau^ces great largess
without your deserte / Behold then fro the beginning of your lif in all times
if ever ye cowde fi^de in you any manner of well lityl or much: but that ye
have received it of god by his special love and grace that he has given to
you more than to many other / And with thise great bountees that he has given
you / Remember you of the great harms and dangers that he has defended you
and deliuerd you from / and say or think in this manner / Most merciful
lord Ihesu I know well that I have often sinned dedely / both by will and deed.
whereby ye might by rightful Judgment have conde^pned me forthwyth in to hell
without end / And this did ye not / but by your great mercy has spared me /
and given me leyser to do penance. And by this only reison am I bound to
serve you / and love you over all thing / And wha^ ye shall have in such
manner well enserchid in your heart the great graces and gifts that ye have
received of our lord Ih^u christ / If ye auyse you well your lif and your deeds.
and behold what well / what love and what kyndnesse ye have yielded to him that
has showed you so great love and done somoche for you with out your deserte.
Perauenture ye shall well perceive in your self yt no thing in regard have
ye yelden to him. but oonly syn^e / and if ye may find there any well. it is
so lityll. that it is as no thing against so many graces and benefaytes as
he has lent and given you and when these things ye have well remembered and
well turned and returned / then with a hole mind speak or think humbly and
devoutly in your heart toward him My sweet lord Ih^u christ I perceive well
that some Rent am I bounden to give you for so many bou^tees and weles as ye
have given me And I know well that though I had a thousand worlds in my
power for to give you. no thing should that increase you. For your glory and
riches is so great and infenite. that there may no thing increase it / for ye
have need of noothyng / and therefore good lord I wot well / that ye ask of me
no more than may be found in my power / This is to know. that I love you /
and serve you with all my soul / with all my heart. and with all my power. But
this may I not have but of your gift. for I have no thing of myself / but
sin^e and malice / And it were to great a wrong and unkindness to yield you
sin^e and malice for your great bou^tee and swetnesse that ye have showed me /
and truly than behooves me to have it of you For there is no well nor goodness
but it comes of you But how shall I have it of you / not by bye^ge for I have
no good to give you but of your own. for ye are lord of all thing / and have
power over al / Ha good lord then behooves it me to get it by humble and
fair prayer. And if I pray to you ye may ryghtfully refuse it. for this that I
am a wretchyd sin^er And yet mercyful lord I know well that though I had in me
the sin^es and malyces of all creatures / which should be ouermoche. yet were
all my vile wretchydnesse lityll in comparison of your great bou^te Wherefore
almiighty god al merciful and piteous / I beseech you that your great bou^tee
be not wythdraw by my wretchidnesse Sith it is so good lord that I yield me to
you / and come to you with great dread and dyspayr for my great wretch^ydnesse
/ but yet with great sure hope of you for your merueylous mercy and bou^tee /
and since ye axe of me no more for all ye weles and graces that I have received
of you / but that I should love you over all thing / and this may I not have
but oonly of you and of your gift / Wherefore most merciful lord sweet
Ihesu I beseech you. for that love that made you descend from heaven. and to be
come man for man and to suffer so cruel and hard death for love of the
redempco^n of man. That it may pleyse you tern toward me: and grant me of
your grace that I may yield you my lityll poor love against the great merueylous
and mercyful love ye have showed unto me / So that my poor heart rest on no
creature by vain and deceyuable love contrary to your will and pleysure / As
verily as I know well that no thing is to be beloved / But for bountee or
beauty that they have received of you / And most gracyous lord for ye
paynfull pasco^n that ye deyned to suffer for my sins / ye that never did
syn^e / I require and humbly beseech you. that ye grant me very sorrow and
true repentance for my sins in this lif / so that I be not by them
deliuerde to eternal pain / And dear suster when ye shall thus have spoken to
the sone. turn you then to his blessid mother. and say or think. O most
blessid glorious virgyn mary and mother of our lord Ih^u christ / for that sweet
love that was between you and your dear sone when ye so swetly enbrased him
the^ same that is the king of glory And with your breast gaaf him sowke / and
many a sweet kiss gave and Received of him / I require and humbly beseech you
/ that ye purchase me that grace of your dear child truly to love him. And my
prayer so to auau^ce / that I may atteyne his blessid love / And I beseech
you mother of mercy / for that great sorrow that was in your heart when ye saw
your dear sone with out gylte suffer so hard and cruel death: for me sinful
and all other syn^ners. that it will pleyse you to be mean for us to get us
his grace of true repentance for our sins / here in th^is wretchyd and short
life: so yt we may to his pleysure peasible depart* and come Joyfully to ye
presence of your dear sone and you / there to continue without end / Amen /

Here follows a Treatise that spekyth of the virtue. and of the branches of
the appultree. which is expouned morally: as follows here after /
THE Prophet says thise words / I shall mount to the appultree / and take of
the fruit / Sometime is understand by the appultree the cross / And sometime
penance. Sometime contemplacyon /

On the appultre of the cross gader men the fruit of life. On This appultree
should have vij branches / and upon every branch a bird and a flower / The
first branch is consideracyon of him self / that is when the soul knows
hyrselfe / and enserchyth faithfully and truly in her conscience. so that
therein abide no thing that should dysplese god Upon this branch makyth the
pecok his neest / The pecok is of such nature that when she slepyth on nyghtes
/ and wakyth suddenly. she cries for the fere that she has to lose her bewte.
This signefyeth the soul that our lord has formed and created so fair that
in the night of this derke world ought always to be in dread / so that she
lease not her beauty / which ben the bountees and the graces that god has
lent and given her. so ought she by great dysco^forte to cry when she felith
and knows any derknesse / and shortly and with ferme faith to chase away
all her defawtes / Upon this brau^che is a full fair flour that is of good
odor. and also has an heavenly color / which is called Narde. It is an
herb lityll and low and of hot nature / that signefieth humilite. that gladly
obeys hirself / and that may not be done without ye hete of charite^ Such
humylite yeldeth great color and odor / for it drew ye sone of god down to
earth / so as our lady it witnesses* there where she sayth^ For he has behold
the humylite of his hondmayde. She said not the virgynite nor the charity / nor
the noblesse / nor many other virtues / wherwyth she was fulfilled. But she
said rather humylite / For this was the special virtue wherefore the sone of
god descended in her For if she had not be perfect meke he would never have
chosen her. for he resists to the proud. and to the humble gives his grace.
Well rested this sweet lady upon the brau^che of contemplacyon / that kept
humylite / and lost not her holiness Upon this brau^che desired dauyd to
sit / when he said in prayenge Bedewe me lord with esoppe / then shall I be
more white tha^ snow Isoppe signefieth that same ye. narde does / The Isoppe
purges the breast. and humylyte purges the heart of Rancour / of envy / of
shrewdness and of al felonyes^ By this desired dauyd to be clensid after his
great sin / for he knew well that this was the true medicyn /

The second brau^che of contemplaco^n is co^punccion of their neighbors. for
wha^ ye soul has good will to amend all this that god is displesed for. and
by ye knouleche receives the flower of very humylytee. Then ought she to
have compascyon of her neighbors / the appultree of Penance gader men seven
fruytes / Four to the body: and three to the soul The first fruit that the
body shall have after his penance* done shall be clerenesse / so scripture
says The just folk shall shine as the son^e in the Reame of their fader / Of
this says saint poul / we shall behold says he our lord Ihesu christ that
shall refourme the bodies of our humanytee. as figure to the body of his
clernesse The second fruit that the body shall have / shall be liightnesse.
for it shall be as light as the thought is now. Whereof men find of our lord
after his resurrexcyon that he was light / For now apered he to them that were
in eumans* and forthwith to them that were in Iherusalem. The third fruit that
the body shall have shall be subtylte. They shall not be then so groos as
they are now / but they shall be full subtle / As men find also of our lord
Ihesu christ after the said resurrexco^n / that he entered among his dyscyples
when the doors were shytte / This might not be done before but by miracle /
The fourth fruit that the body shall have / shall be Impassibylite / this
shall be health / for it shall be so hole that it shall never may have siknes
in bodi nor in soul. thise four fruytes shall the body have / and the soul
shall have three. The first shall be the knowledge of the godhede whereof saint
poul says / I know now a party by figure. and as men look in a glass / But
then shall I know like as I am now known we shall know god in all as he is
and see him clerly without couerture or without glass. this shall be the
light of the great glories that the soul shall have / The second shall be
the glory of humanyte of Ih^u christ / The third shall be love. For if the
soul have knowleche and sight and love not / this should be no perfyte
glory / But she love her god who^ she shall see and know Now come we to the
appultree of conte^placo^n / Thappultree is streite and skle^der dou^ward and
large upward. For the soul that will mount in conte^placo^n ought to be
straight and skle^der dou^warde to all erthly things and to all carnal
affecco^ns / and large upward in the love of god and of his neighbor / For
like as the appultree the more plain it be without bows till it come to the
height the more spredeth it in ye top. thus does the soul that stretchith
on height by conte^placo^n of time haui^ge no low bows of worldly ne
carnalle affection spredeth much more upward in love to god /

And should apply her humbly and gladly to the need of their afflicco^ns. Upon
this brau^che makyth the shrikeowle her neest / that is of such nature: that
she drawith her about such places as deed bodies ben beried. And wha^ any is
nere his death she felith it aferre / and cries loud by great pity and sorrow:
This bird signefyeth the co^pascion of the soul that should put her in great
dyligence about hem that be^ in sin for to convert hem and bring hem again
in the way of salvation / And when she perceyueth any that aprocheth to the
death of ye soul by dedely syn^e / then should she cry by great lamentaco^n
to god with teres and with orysons / Upon this brau^che growyth the flower of
glane / this glane growyth about waters / By this water is understand they
that Re^ne in dedely sin about whom should grow charity and give
attendau^ce to the compascyonat soul / Upon this brau^che was mounted david.
that said / Lord for this that the syn^ers have not kept your laws / I have
cast this great habu^dance of teres. Upon this brau^che was thereime mounted
the prophet yt said who shall give water to my head / a for this yt he thought
water might dry and fail. said h^e after / and to mine eyes wells of teres
/ that I might weep the wretchydnesse of my people / He thought teres that
never should sease / Such teres should h^aue the soul yt will mount upon the
appultree of comte^placo^n. as an holy fader was thereon well mounted. that said
who is seek in all holy church either in body or in soul / but that I be
trowblid and sorry with hem /

The third brau^che of thappultree is temporell afflicco^n / when she puts
hirself in great afflicte by penance / and also that she suffers Ioyefully
and with a peasible heart all aduersitees for the love of our lord. Upon
brau^che makith the swan her nest / that is of such nature that when she shall
deye she singyth This signefyeth the soul that has Joy in trybulacion. Upon
this brau^che were mounted thappostles of whom me^ say: the apostles had great
Joy when they went out of the cou^s^yles of the Jews and pharesees / where
they were beten. for this that they thought them worthy to suffer shame for
the name of our lord Ihesu christ / Upon this brauche grew the flower of the
lelye / whereof the spowse says in the Cantycles /

/ Thus as the lelye is among the thorns. thus is my love among the
chylderne of the world / When the flower of the lelye is among the thorns
they prycke her. and she pryckyth hem not. but rather yeldeth good odor by
true pacyence / Thus ought the holy soul to do. She ought not answer by
sharp words but rather ought to yield good odor by true pacyence to all
them that done her any offense. so that she may say with saint poul / we
ben of good odor to god in all places^ But they that yelden evil for evil.
and ben ready to answer by signs and by words. And will not forgete one word
that folk say to them or do any wrong / nor will not forgive / all such
folks ben not of the appyl tree of co^templacyon /

The fourth brau^che of contemplacyon is compuncco^n / Compu^ccyon is when the
soul is sore mouyd and prycked with the trauey^es of our lord Ihesu christ. so
that she forgeteth all other pain and traueyle that may come to her / For as
men will and may more ease ^y drive out a wedge or a pyn of tree that is
myssette by a another In like wise when the soul is meuyd and pryckyd with
trybulacyon. It ought to remember how her souerayn savior and love was for
her perced and nailed on the cross. And this sharpness and sorrow should put
away all other pain and sorrow from her ^ert Upon this brau^che makith her
neest a bird which is callid harpia. that has the se^blau^ce of a man^es
visage / and her nature is to slay the first man she fyndeth / and then gooth
she to some water / where she beholds hirself. and sees that she has slain
her own liknes. and then^ makyth she a full great sorrow always that ever she
saw any man. This signefyeth ye soul that slew christ by her syn^e / whose
se^blau^ce is in her / for to his se^blau^ce was she created / And when she
reme^breth how Ih^u was deed for our sins then^e ought ^ she to make great
sorrow and lamentaco^n / Thus as the turtle does wha^ she has lost her felaw.
and she come to the place where he deyed / and find feders or any other sign
she makyth great sorrow Thus ought the soul to do that has lost Ih^u christ
her good lord and love / she ought to do thus as did the daughter of a king
that abode orphelin. And men took away her enheritaunce / Then was there the
sone of a mighty king that had so great pity of her that he took this yo^ge
lady to his wife and conqueryd again her heritage. and deyed in the bataylle /
Then this young lady took the arms of the knight that for her was dede^ And
beheld them every day weeping upon tharmes and made merueyllous great sorrow /
The daughter of the king that abode orphelin and lost her heritage / this was
the soul that was daughter of adam / that was a right noble man when he was in
paradys / But he lost his enherytau^ce when he was driven thens by his sin /
And then had the sone of god great pity for the soul that was thus
dysheryted / and dyscended fro paradyce / to marye her: this same day of
marriage was made / when he Joined his deyte to our humanite and fro that day
fought for us xxxij year and an half / and at the last deyed for us in the
battle of the cross / Wherefore we ought well to do thus as this young lady
did always to have his death in remembrance / and with great compasco^n often
to behold his arms / This is his cross / his spear / his nails: and all ye
Instruments of his passion / and weep every day for this. that our lord and
souerayn love was deed for us. Upon this brau^che growith the rose / that
signefyeth marterdom spu^elly. and tho that be thus touched and prycked
forgeten lightly all worldli troubles: and may well saey ^ am wounded by
charity / for this is the true way of charity / For as well content is the very
charitable with hem that blame hem^ as them that praise hem / For the soul
that is verily confermed in god. ne is not ouerthroe^ by aduersite ne a reysid
by prosperity The v. brau^che of co^templaco^n is abidyng / wha^ ye soul is of
so great desire that she abides our lord in desiryng. Upon this brau^che
were mounted ye prophets of tholde time / that somoche desired the coming of
our lord. wha^ they said come lord and tarry not / and a another said / if he
make taryeng abide we him / for he shall com / and tarry not long / Upon this
brau^che was mounted dauyd / wha^ he said behold we and abide we our lord /
and after said he thus / as the heart desires the well / thus desires my
soul to the my god /. and in a another place says he / Dormitauit ai^a mea
prete dio / Saint poul was mounted on^ day on this brau^che and said. I desire
to be dyssolued / and to be with christ. and in a another place he said* Wretched
man who shall deliver me of this body of death. Upon this brau^che makith ye
nightyngale his neest. yt is of such nature that he singyth al night against ye
day / and wha^ he seth ye day and the son^e rise he makyth so gre Joy ye uneath
he kepith his life this signefieth ye holy soul yt in the derke night of this
lif abides our lord / and wha^ she felith his comi^g in her heart by grace^ she
has so great Joy / that she can another speak nor be stylle / such was the
good ^ld symeo^ / that was so Joyful when he behold the coming of the sone of
god / whereof he says / Ha god wha^ shall come the sweet child / when shall he
be born^ when shall I see hi^ whether shall I dure so long that he may find
me here at his holy natyuite. May ever my eyes see that same / by whom the eye
of the soul shall be awakid^ Thise words said he every day in his prayer. by
ye oppressynge of the great desire of his heart / And by his great desire had
he answer of the holy ghost yt he should not feel death till he had see^ the
very sone of god. Thus did he as the nyghtyngale that sings all the night /
When he saw com day. and the sone of Justice of who^ mary was mother. and
brought him to be offryd in the temple. he ran against him and enbraced him /
and held him against his heart / and had so great Joy / that uneath his heart
might abide it. And then made he this fair song Nu^c dimittis seruu^ tuu^
dn^e / etc / Lord put your servant in peace / for now I see the pease that I
have somoche desired ^ whereof I have somoche Joy that death is no pain to
me. And for gods sake do we as simeon did / enbrace we this sweet child in
tharmes of our hertes / Saint anne enbraced him in the temple / that had somoc
desired him: Upon this branch grew the flower of safre^ and the flour blanch
/ which signefyen / that this fervent desire makes the soul pale and yelow /
whereof it says in the cantycles / let me not to behold though I be black
for the sone has dyscoloured me And in a another place says he arrayed with
flowers set on with thorns. for I languysshe in love / The sixte branch of
the appyll tree is vysitacyon / when our lord has pity on the soul desiryng
hi^ he vysiteth her by his grace. that he gives her the felyng of his sweet
presence / that she has somoche desired. Upon this branch makyth the swalow
her nest / and she is of such nature / that she takyth her fedi^ge in air and
in fleeng / This sign fyeth the soul vysited of god / that ought to take no
comfort nor pleisure of no temporell thing: but of god allonly. And tho
things nedeful to the body should they take thus. as in fleeng. that is to
abide thereon as lityll as they may / but only for their sustenau^ce / Upon
this brau^che was mounted ezechiel wha^ he said all thus / as ye fawn that
cries after his mother / and takes no comfort but of her / thus the soul
contemplatyf when she comes again to hyrselfe / and sees the great Joy that
she shall have of this suffrau^ce. she ough^ not to obey her to her own will
/ nor to sin but allonely to the will of god. / Upon this brau^che grows
the marygolde. which is of such nature / that when the son shows the
flower spredeth / And wha^ the son wythdr^^eeth it closes / Right thus should
do the comtemplatyf soul against the son^e of Iustyse / and ought always to
open her heart by desire and by love / And if it fall any time that grace be
wythdrawen. they should close their hertes against all forreyne pleysures. and
against all sin. and ought to take no rest nor comfort till it come again.
And as the marygolde follows the son^e / so ought the contemplatyf soul to
follow our lord to serve him / to desire him / and to go after him / Such was
mari mawdeleyne when she went to the sepulcre / where she found no thyng^ but
thangel that answered her of who^ she took lityll head / for she was so fervent
in the love of our lord who^ she sought. that she might receive no comfort
of thangel / And yet was he as clear as a full fair sterre / But she axed for
the son^e that all enlumyneth / and took lityll keep of al other cle^nes / She
sought hi^ often where he was not. and thider came she with right great desire:
For there was the last place where she had left him^ and for this wend she
there surely to find him by her desires. And afterward she found him. For
truly who that will persevere in devout prayers / and refuses for him all
other forreyne pleysures / they shall surely find him without doubt. himself
promyseth so in thapocalips and says / I love them that love me / and those
that wake bytymes for me shall find me / And thus for cause she loved him /
she fond him / and yet said he more / If any open his gate for me I will enter
in with a good will and dwell with him. and he with me / and shall ete gladly
with him. and he with me. Upon this branch sat dauyd / wha^ he said my soul
has refused all comfort / but oonly of the / The seventh branch of
contemplacyon is affecco^n. that is. when the soul is come to this that she
felith somoche of god that the humanyte ne may not hold her but rather fail.
Upon this brau^che was dauyd mounted / when he said. I shall remember me of god
and shall delight me and exercise me in the love of hym^ and my spirit fails
And in a another place he says mi soul fails. Upon this brau^che makyth her
nest the phenyx. that signefyeth the spirytuell folk / for this that he is
singular. For full few is of them. or of such that come to this hye stage /
The phenyx is of such nature / that when he shall deye / he gadreth together
thorns / and gooth in to the most hot part of all the land yt he is in. and
when he has heped them / he flees over them so long that they begin to
brenne. and then bren^eth he himself in that fire / and of those ashes
grows a another fenyx The phoenix in one sense signefieth our lord Ih^u crist
that was with out fader in earth. to whom was never none like / and in him was
all ye branches of virtues assembled / which by love brent himself on
thaulter of the cross. The phenyx also signefyeth the holy soul spirituell
that has gadred together the thorns of good virtues / and bears hem in to the
hete of charity / So make they to god sacrefyse of body and soul wha^ they
offer to him in thodour of his humanyte on the auter of their hertes by perfyte
desire. and this sacrefyce is full pleysaunt to god / whereof dauyd said / Such
sacrefyse is crase / And in a another place said / Then is the sacrefise crase
when (...) is raised by wings of (...) ^esires / out of al bodily affeccyons
and Imagynacyons / and she is Joined to god in crase / and is dronken of the
crase of the holy ghost / so that for the time her behooves to fail by the
great habundante Joy that she felith / This signefyeth the queen of saba /
that came to Iherusalem for to see the sapye^ce of Salamon / whereof she had
herd the great renomme But when she saw him / she said she saw more than she
had herd / And as scripture says she failed in hirself for the merueiles that
she beheld in him. The fruit of this brau^che is Ih^u christ / that said I am
the flower of the field / and the lelye of the valeye Of this fruit said
Elisabeth / Benedictus fructus. etc. The leaves of this brau^che ben the cries /
sighes^ the sownynges / and the snobbynges that they have that been thus mounted.

HEre ben declared the signs whereby men may seek the love of our lord /
WE Christian ought much hertly to Remember in our hertes and think on the
rih^t great love yt the sweet child of bethleem Ih^u crist showed to us / by
the wound of his precious side / in vij. signs full of right great love. Th^e
first sign of love was showed to us in this / yt he would make of his precious
wound the leure red and blody to call our hertes. that by flee^g thoughts
often seaseth hem by falls love upon the careyne of vayn creatures The second
sign is in this yt h^e made their tresour to redeem us this tresour is that of
his precious b^ody was put out the most precious lif that ever was or ever may
be. and gaf it for to redeem our souls fro the pains of hell. He gaf
therefore also his precious soul full of all weles / full of grace without
mesure. full of all the blessid diuynite / full of the might of god ye fader Full
of the sapyence of god the sone / full of the grace of god the holy ghost / And
for asmoche as one bou^tee requires a another. we ought to open to him the
tresour of our hertes. which should be in gold. ensence. and myrre. this is to
know the gold of fervent love. thensence of devout prayer. the myrre of
penance and of satysfacco^n The third sign is showed in this. that he made
there a well to wasshe our hertes this is the well of grace that spri^geth
fro the depnes of the diuynite / and comes thorugh the wound of his side /
and costeth upon the gravel of holy medytacyon / and decendeth in to the
draught of the conscye^ce. right bren^yngly / for to put out all uncleanness:
The fourth sign is in this / that he made there a tavern. to make us drink
this tavern has the humanytee nature fulfyllid with wine of consolacyon^ that
the true heart ordeneth in very charity / In this tavern descended the sone of
god by ix. degrees / yt thus represents the ix. orders of angels. This wine
god the fader tu^ned / god the sone pressed. god ye holy ghost it filled with
full mesure through holy desire he raised by ye virtue of the fire of love /
whereof the furnays of the heart ought to be always hot The v. sign is in this
that he made there a nest for us to rest in / In this nest should the religious
soul seek ye rest of his conscience by holy conte^placo^n / and flee
thoccaco^ns that might meue her heart to desire and spredde to many creatures /
by disordinat and falls affection The vj. sign is this tha the made there a
sheld to defend us from our enmyes. that seaseth not day ne night to do
their power to deceive us / Thise enmyes be^ the flesh the world / and the
fend / from which none may defend hem nor keep / but by ye virtue of the
pasco^n of our lord ihesu christ. and of his sweet wou^des The vij. sign is in
this that he made there a tree of lif for us in hi^ to entree / and al thus as
the wax of the candell should entree within the wyke for to draw the light to
it / thus should ye religious heart be e^tred within this wound by love and
brennyng charity. and ought to be couerd with earth by ye knowledge of our own
freelte / and wrapped in the bark by remebrau^ce of that death that us al has
redeemed / and seek the reward of the same by the steps of holy works in the
virtue of perseuerau^ce with very humylite / and then draws the light of
deuoco^n / wardur of honest conuersaco^n / savor right pleysau^t / with sweet
refeccyon. Thus is the heart drawn to nature divine by the virtue of love
which of two makyth one all in / Joy that never shall have end With this
leure be our hertes calde of this tresour truly redeemed / of this well clean
wassht / of this tauern swetly made drunk / In this nest stilly to rest with
this sheelde defended and kept. So that without end be we in god so set /
that never in no time be we from him dysseuered / Amen /

How faith exhorts the person to eschew and have in contempt all evil
thoughts / and to reduse the^ self in all points to good works under the hope
of divine grace /
Great awayte ought eueri bodi to have upon theymself. yt they return not again
unto those sins that they have been reconsiled of For vain is the penance.
that the same offense soyleth again. Where resist with al your power from doing
those sins that ye have lost / so that they grow not in you aye^. Then^e
understand what ye be^ and to what intent ye be^ made / for such as god has
ordained you ought ye to be Have in you very believe that ye by one only sin^e
be^ many virtues lost / Then^e for the love of god give not your soul to the
power of the flessh^ / suffer none vnclen^es to abide in you / Resist at the
begi^nyng of evil thoughts / and soon may ye then surmou^t the remenaunt.
Know ye for troth that by your thoughts shall ye be Iuged for the body may
not be corrupt till the thought be first corrupt / And when the will thereto
consents the flesh is all ready to syn^e. and therefore torn your will from
evil thoughts / and the body shall not sin Understood to this that is
admonested to you: that ye be not foiled with none vnclen^es of lecherye / nor
that ye be vainquynshed by fornycaco^n. for thise be^ great sin^es among all
other / For better is it todey than to do fornycaco^n / and better to lose
your life than be foiled with lecherye / Therefore bewaar / for contynuau^ce
sometime makith one to syn^e. Haa god how chastity atteyneth the blestful reame
of heaven / and lechery draws a man to the derke dongeon of hell If lecheri
asayleth you: think what turme^t they suffer that has be thereto habandon^ed
and horrible be^ the pains of hell / wherefore pray god devoutly with teres
both night and day / and when ye awake of your first sleep return ye do
prayers. for customably oryson surmou^teth tharmes of the fe^de. Oryson is the
first virtue again thasawtes of all evil thoughts / Fulfill not your appetyte
by metes / but chastise your bodies by fasting / for otherwise it is hard to
vaynquyssh^ the te^ptaco^n of the flessh^. but by fasting / and orysons / for
ouermoche delicacye in mete and drink enclineth the flessh^ to uncleanness /
The eyes be^ the first arms of vnclen^esse / The sight is ye first couetyse
of men or wymen / Therefore wythdraw your eyes if ye be nighe the serpent. so
that ye be not hurt / For if ye be nygh ye fire / though ye were of yren. yet
should ye be sometime warm For that sin^e hurts greatly such as be^ fou^den
vayn / Therefore ocupye you per fightly in good works and good thoughts /
Chatyse your lodyes by rightful traueyle / and so may ye prouffyte to yourself
and to other / And be always humble to all folks / If ye keep humylite ye
shall have glory / for the more humble ye be the more shall ye follow the hienes
of glory Use not to auau^te you of your good deeds / so that ye bring not
yourself in pride / But rather obey and humble yourself most when ye feel
your heart meuyd to be rased with pride. Beware of hye mou^tynge for fere of
over low descendynge. For pride casted down thangels out of heaven and made
them fendes in hell / Remember ye of the humylite of our lord / which was
obeysau^t to his fader unto the death So take ye perfightly thensa^ple of him
/ Will ye be humble. Then have always shame in your heart of the remembrance
of your sins And goo always with humble manners and sobre vysage. and by
sighyng and wepi^g in your heart. and sweet shall be tho teres / for great
sin^es asken great amends / Over all things make you sure of your sins For
therein shall ye find matter ynouh^ to make you pensif. And in all your other
siknesses and trowbles be not sorrowful / But ye ought hu^bli to yield god
thankynges. that has sent them to you / to thentent yt ye should come the
more clean before him Have always attemperance in prosperyte / and pacyence in
aduersitee Refrain your Ire. and overcome it by suffrau^ce / Suffer other
pacye^tly when they do you wrong / For by pacyence and being stylle shall ye
soon ouercom ye wrathful / Think what pain almighty god suffered for you.
that was perced with nails / and crowned with thorns. and condemned to be
crucified on the cross This ought to give you a great comfort to bear with
pacye^ce all Iniurye. And be not hasty to stryke them that have stryken you.
But suffer al such things for the love of god. and he wy^^ give you a great
reward / If ye have displeysed any man. sleep not till ye have accorded him
with you again / If any man has done against you / yield him not after his
desert / but with good heart pardon him / For wrath / departs man from god.
Be of good will to all folks / If your enmye have any mysauenture / ye ought
not to rejoice it / For ye may hap to fall in like peril / With compleyners
pleyne ye / with them that weep / weep ye. Be of charytable heart to all
folks / and care not who prayseth you. or blames you / For none may better
know what ye ben than yourselfe / Be simple and clean and of dyscrete manner /
so that your demeanyng offend not the voys of other / whereby they may fall
in sin. Flee the company of many folks and specially of them that been
light to fall in sin / Who desires and haunteth the company of wise
folks: is wise / And a peryllous thing is it to be conuersaunt among them
that been evil / Vain words foylen much the soul / Let never thing pass
your mouth that should offend the eres of the herers / Foul word shall never
be without Judgment. Take good keep to your mouth / so that ye speak not but
in time and place couenable / For every creature shall yield reckoning of their
words on the day of Judgment / Be not light to speak before great folks. but
if ye be questyoned or commanded / Full herd it is with much speech a man to
keep him without some offense Be not hasty to Judge the lif of other folks.
Detraccyon is great sin. and cause of endless da^pnacyon / When ye be meuyd to
Judge other folks / think then on your own sins. And then shall ye
fyn^de lityll cause to Judge other if ye take good keep of youreselfe / Or who
that spekyth evil of other. or who that been glad to here / evil / they ben
parteners to both offenses. Be not light of believe to every bodies saying /
Nor speak none untrue thing. For every lesyng is a syn^e ^ The untrue tongue
says his own will: Dauyd says god shall destroy al those that use lesynges
/ Promise not that thing / that ye may not do For much be ye to be blamyd if
ye yield not that thing that ye promised. Let not your word be contrary to
your thought / for no thing may be hid from god / for he sees and knows
al / Good lif is always cause of Joy / If ye live well ye need never to be in
sorrow. If ye be virtuous auaunt not thereof. whereby ye may lose it /
Nevertheless when ye do or think any evil / show it anon by confession /
then^ shall ye be sauid. For sin grows from lityll to g^ete / And if it be
showed by confession it is soon made of great lityll. Sloth noyeth much to
good works. Necligence slaketh the courage / and quenches the light of
conmyge: Vices ouercometh sone the slothful persones^ Take keep to this / to
thentent that ye ben not founden vayn For if sloth has a lityll entree it
will lightly grow tomoche / If ye be good and virtuous. then shall ye be
gloryfied / Beware when ye do any thing well / that ye coueyte not the preyse
of folks / whereby ye may lose the great reward that ye should have of god /
Lose no time / but that ye do always some good / nor coueyte not to know of
other thus ^ that they would be lo^he ye knew. When folks speak to you /
harken them redely / and speak by deliberacyon / For in some thing is the end
gretter than the beginning / In which the speker has more great honor: and
better should be the last word than the first. Demean yourselfe to every body
/ so that ye offend not the will of god / Great pain shall have the cruel
persons and such as thereto consenten / Wherefore consent ye to no sin /
But when ye ben moved soon return your hertes. s^o that ye be not e^uenemyd
therewith Be not ouersharpe to your seruates / but do so that they have delight
to serve you / In all your works ought to be attemperaunce / For every
ouermesure torneth to vice / as to much or te lityll. In all your deeds hold
descreco^n. for if ye keep not dyscrecyon / there is no virtue in no thing
that ye do^ but rather it is vice / Do by other as ye would they should do by
you / Do none enoyes to other by your wytnes. nor with your word empeyre no
body / Do not wyllingly harm to none. lest ye suffer such at the day of
Judgment / Ne maynt^ne none again troth / be they rich or poor / Look ye be
true to all / so that your troth be never corrupt by no couetyse of richesse
Give never Judgment without mercy. It is a peryllous thing to Judge a man by
suspecco^n For sometime is blamed the same that is gyltlees / Be not raised in
pride for none honor that ye have / but keep you in humylite For it is full
hard to have honor without sin / The honor of this world is so
deceyuable / that it makyth sometime the most mighty persons to suffer the
most strong torments / For the highest trees ben most in dangeour of the
wind or tempest / The rych^e man arrayed in purple and gold and has his
knights abowte hi^ and his arms with much more no bless / yet for all that
is he often in great trystesse. anguyssh^ and peril Though he lie in a bed
of silk yet is he often in much more trowble than he that lies in raynen or
in the straw / Lytill while endures the glory of this world / Say me now
where ben the kings the princes. and the mighty / and the great rich folks
of th^is world. Al be^ passed. as a shadow vanyssht. and as a dreme. And who
that enplieth the^ in the great gaynes of this world. shall never have rest.
wherefore if ye will have rest / cast from you the besie cures of this world
for riches is but seldom gote^ without sin^e. It befallith often that they that
have great richesses have not always rest. And special they yt most delight
them therein / For thise erthly charges disceuereth man from god. For none may
have ye glory of god and of the world together. In this manner may ye know how
ye should live a right / Therefore take heed that ye use not tho things that been
defended in this lityll treatye. The most rightful ought not to trust in his
own bounte / For our sins overthrows all anon / if it be not every day
purged by good works / The synful man or woman ought not dispeyre of the mercy
of god For god would they should be converted and live / thus as by wisdom is
customably made great famylieryte after dyscorde / Better it is to dyspose the
seculer famylieryte* than to lose the salvation of the soul And as we have
followed the evil folks to do evil / From hens forth be we not slowthfull to
follow the good folks to do well / and goo no more out of the right way Who
will be good. be he first as a dyscyple. and begin no thing of himself /
whereby he may after repent him. Then if ye will well beho^de this techyng and
counseyle / the ofter that ye behold them the more of fruit ye shall find in
them. And god grant us grace to keep them well: to the end that it may
cleanse us of al our sin^es / and make us hole of all our wretchydnesse. very
god and very man without end / by all the world / of the worlde^ Amen /

HEre begins a techynge by manner of predycacyon made to the people by master
Alberte conteynyng ix. artycles.

Master Alberte Archebysshop of Coleyne said these words in the person of
Ihesu christ /

The first is this. Give a a penny for my love in thy life while thou have
power and health And this shall pleyse me better. and more shall avail the /
than if me^ gaaf after thy death for the a hepe of silver / that were as hye as
from earth to the sky. The second is weep one tere for my suffraunce and
passion that I have suffrid for the and for thy sins / and it shall pleise me
more / and be better for the / than if you wept asmoche of teres as is water in
the sea / for any other thing yt is vayn and chau^geable / The third is this /
break thy sleep / and thy own will when thou may do it to worship and
praise me. and it shall pleyse me more. and be better for the than if men send
xij. knights in good quarrel for the after thy death The fourth is this / keep
the fro evil saying of thyn neighbor / and hurt no body wylfully. and this
shall plese me more and be beter for the tha^ if thou wentest barefote so long
yt men might follow the by the trackes of thy blood The v. is this suffer
Ioyfulli a hard word wha^ men say to the for the love of me. and this shall
pleise me more and better for the / than if it might be that you suffredest as
many rods to be broken upon thy body as might lie on a great feld The vj. is
herberow the poor / and do good to them that be^ nedy. and thou shall pleyse
me more and be beter to the / than if you fastid xl. year bread and water / The
vij. is do good to thy power in all yt thou may / and put peace and love among
thy neighbors / and it shall pleyse me more and better to the / than if you were
every day rauyssh^t to heaven / The viij is this / if you desire oni thing either
for soul or for body. or for any other thing. or caas / pray therefore her^ly
to myself / and it shall plese me more and better for the / than if my mother
and all the saints in heaven prayed me for the / somoche it pleseth me thine
own prayer with true heart / The ix. is this / love me souerainly over al
creatures of good heart / of good love and true / and this shall plese me more
and be better for ye than if there were a pyller that retchid from earth to
heaven / and sharp as rasours / and were possible that you myghtest goo upon
this pyller. and come down again every day and not dey It pleyseth me more that
thou should love me faithfully with all thy soul. and with all thy heart
enteerly Here begyn^en diverse treatises and ensamples of saint poul / and
other doctors in diuynite.

In noi^e dn^i amen / Thapostle saint poul says / that all they that will live
surely in Ih^u christ shall suff^e persecuco^n But our lord ihesu christ will
not that his chosen servants fail in trybulaco^n For he comforts and
helps them himself and gives the^ virtue of his grace and says / Have no
fere I am with you always unto the end / And haue^ you the holy scryptures to
teache. you* For by patience and comfort of holy scripture ought al folks to
have hope in the same that said Trust ye in me for I have vai^quysshed the
world / wherefore in all and over all is necessary and profitable ye
remembrance of the paynful and meke suffrau^ce of our lord Ih^u christ. It
comforts in all tribulaco^n It surmounteth all temptacyon / It delivers
from all trystesse / It takyth away all vain gladness. And of dyspayres
makyth deliverance / and is the sure true hope of pardone. It is the rule of
obedyence and the example of pacyence / and sure medicyne again all evil. And
of all true weles the very rote. There were six master together / and one
asked to a another what thing they should say of god and began to speak of
trybulaco^n / The first master said if any thing were more noble than
tribulacion to any creature living in this world / god rader would have given it
to his sone. and therefore he gaaf hi^ more to suffer thereof tha^ to any other
creature yt ever was or shall be. The.ij master said yt if any creature were as
clean fro sin^e as he was at thour that he was cristened* and might live xxx.
year without bodily mete / and also that god had given him grace to speak with
tha^gel in thayre / so as he did to mary magdalen^. yet might he not dysserne
in this lif so great merit as some decerne in auersite by pacye^ce beryng /
The third master said if the mother of god and all the saints that been in
h^^^en prayed for a creature they might not get him so great merit as he
should get by beryng pacie^tly aduersite / The fourth master said that our
lord Ih^u christ henge on the cross half a day / and therefore honor we the
crosse^ But I say that we ought by more great reison honor tribulacion than
the cross For our lord suffryd that more than thyrty year in earth / The fythe
master said rather than to leave the leest reward that might be gotten by
pacyent suffryng of trybulacion / he had as leave forbere the sight of god unto
the day of dome. An holy man say the y^ non^ is worthi to have tribulaco^n; but
such as desire it gladly Tribulaco^n quenchith the sins tribulaco^n arrayeth
the person to know ye secrets of god / tribulaco^n makith a man to know
himself / and other / and multiplieth ye virtues / and preuith hi^ as gold in
the furnays of god / and charity / this does tribulaco^n Tribulaco^n bieth aye^
the time lost / and the creature e^belissheth with innocense. and makyth hi^
able to receive all the weles that god gives to his fre^des / and it is the
tresour yt none may be co^parid to trybulacyon / uneath the creature to good /
And that is the most certain well that is.

Now askyth the sixte master wherefore we suffer so enuyously trybulacyon /
And it is answerde for three causes / The first is for we have lityll love to
god / The second for we think lityll of the reward that god will give us
therefore / The third for this that we think full lityll of the sufferaunce
that our lord Ihesu christ suffered for us / Praised may he be of his great
bountee. Amen:

Thus ends this present book which treats first of the glorious passion of
our Savior / and of the compascyon that his blessed mother had thereof / And
also shows in a another treatise following wherefore we ought to love our
savior more than any other thing /

Also shows a another treatise much prouffytable for reformacyon of souls
defoyled with any of the vij. dedely sins.

Itm^ a another treatise showing the signs of goostly love. Itm^ a treatise of
the virtues and of the branches of the appultree which is expowned morally as
is before expressyd /

Also folowi^g is declared whereby men may seek the love of our lord Ihesu
christ.

And the last treatise of this foresaid book spekyth to exhort the person to
eschew / and have in co^tempte all evil thoughts / And to reduce theymself
in all points ^o good works / under the hope of dyuyne grace:

Which book was lately translated out of frensh^ in to englisshe by a Right
well dysposed person / for by cause the said person thought it necessary to
al devout people to read / or to here it read / And also caused the said book
to be enprynted / printer's or publisher's device
