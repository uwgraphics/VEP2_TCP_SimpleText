To my honest and kind loving friend, Ma. John Cradocke Cutler, at his house
without Temple Bar: health, hearts-ease and eternal happiness.
YOur affection to all good spirits, and mine the worst of many, has made me
prefer your known kindne^, before the shadow of idle showes^ a Scholar I
hold you none; but I know you understand English, and can conceit an honest
meaning, better then a brain full of more business: and therefore in my love,
have given you this fruit of my thoughts labors: In which, since Divinity is
too deep, Virtue will not ^ell; Law is cost^ie, and Poetry is too common;
Histories are tedious, State matters are too high, and love is grown a
laughing jest* ^ have thought good (leaving all idle humors) to ^all only
upon a few wonders: In the discourse whereof (I doubt not) but you shall find
a little glimmering of the light of my better love: To the assurance whereof,
without fraud or further delay, I have here unto set down my name, thi^ 22.
of December. 1602

Your affectionate poor friend. Ni^h* Breton.

To the Reader.
I Wonder with what title to fit you gentle, wise, or fond and scoffing
Reader, but in hope of the best, I w^ll begin, with; Gentle Reader, let me
entreat you not to wonder at me for writing of Wonders, for there is nothing
common, that is current, but money, and that is grown so scant with a number,
that many a one wonder what kind of thing it is: but, because I have little to
do with it, I will speak^ little of it, and only tell you that it was my hap
to light on a few odd Wonders, that being unhappily set down, might pass
away a little idle time to look on. Now, hoping that some mad-head in the
world, might have as much ley sure to read as I have had to write: I have
thought good, to those good people, to commit the perusing of this little
wonderful piece of work: wherein, if they find nothing that may please them,
I shall wonder at my wit: if any thing does like them, I shall wonder what i^
is, and think the better of it when I know it. In the mean time, least you
wonder too much at me, to make such a do about nothing: I will leave my
wonders to your coni^ctures, and my love to your kind favors: and so rest as
I have reason.

Your friend, N. B.

Merry Wonders.
Green rushes M. Francisco, it is a wonder to see you here in this Country:
why, I was afraid that you had been so out of charity with your enemies, that
you had beenalmost out of love with your friends: but I am glad, that having
wished for you so long, I shall yet enjoy you at last.

Fran. Master Lorillo, I do wonder at your wondering, for though I am contented
to be held a man, yet I would be loath to be worse natured then a dog: for I
am in charity with all the world, though I am not in love with mine own
shadow: but to your purpose, can you either fell what love or a friends is?


Lor. Indeed they are two Wonders in this world, for men are so full of malice,
and women have so little faith, that a friend is like a Phoenix, and a
faithful woman like a black Swanne.


Fran. Now fie man, you are too much to blame, to make a wonder of nothing, for
friendship is the grace of Reason, and love is the joy of life: and therefore
rather wonder at reasons disgrace, in the breath of friendship, and at the
nature of life without love, then to see a true friend or a faithful lover.


Lor. But, is it not then a wonder to think what should be, and s^e what is,
for love is become a riddle, and friendship a dream, where he may wonder at
his fortune, who finds that he looks for.


Fran. Well, I perceive it were a wonder to remove you from your wondering at
these wonders: but is there nothing to be wondered at, but love and friendship?


Lor. Nay, would you not rather say, that I wonder to hear of so much, and
find so little* But leaving to trouble our selves longer with these toys,
which are become such wonders, as are too s^ldome to be seen: let me entreat
you a little to discourse of such wonders as you have met withal, in your last
travail abroad: and what I have seen at home (that may be wor^h the hearing)
I will tell you.


Fran. Content is pleased and therefore not to burn daylight, you shall hear:
at my first arrival in a certain count^y (which for some causes, I will omit
to name) it was my hap to come into a very fair town* or rather City, where
I saw the houses strong and beautiful, the shops richly furnished, handsome
men, and fair women, well apparelled and well countenaunced, so that there was
almost nothing wanting that might seem to make a happy state: but ^t is
wonderful to think, what a world of unhappiness lived within the walls of
this City: for wealth, which should have made men bountiful and charitable,
made them so proud and miserable, that the poor wretches were merrier with a
crust, then the rich with a world of treasure: the fair, which promised much
grace, were so envious, so proud, and so vicious, that I wonder how so great a
beauty to the body, should breed so foul a blot to the soul?


Lor. Alas, nature is subien to weakness, and therefore bear with a little
i^^e^^ertion: age will tea^h repentance, and sorrow is a sa^ue for sin: and
therefore pray rather for the correction of reason, then wonder at the
corruption of nature: but o^wa^^s with the rest of your wonders.


Fran. Oh Sir, excuse is no satisfaction, though contrition be gracious, the
sin of you^h makes the shame of age, and he that is bountiful at his death,
is better in the grave then in the world: but I will leave to argue further
upon the case, and go onward with my course. When I had wondered a while at
particular points, in particular persons, I began to wonder at the state of the
government: for so far as I could ^euill at it with the eye of my s^mple
judgment, the ^hiefest matters were wonderfully well ^uled, laws were
executed according to the estate of the offenders: If he were poor, he was
made an example: if rich, he was made a profit, a profit to the common wealth,
to take away the riches of one that might have been hurt to many: and the
poor, an example to the poor, to take warning rather to work then to want,
for fear by such offen^e to r^ceiue the like punishment of like presumption:
But when I considered of the conscience that was charged with the burden of
blood, I wondered how the hang man could sleep for fear of the devil at his
elbow: An^ again, I wonder not a little at the folly of the wilful, to bring
their wits to such confusion, that neither reason nor observation could take
more place in their apprehention?


Lor. Oh Master Fraunces the misery of this time is great, and laws had need
of exe^uti^n, for else the beggar with his ^re^ping, and the ^hu^le with his
bribing, would so cosen pity with cunning, that Justice should become a Jest,
and common wealths would be overthrown* and since penury to the rich, is as
great a plague, as death is to the poor, let the churl whine and the beggar
hang, or both learn to be honest men: but to the purpose, if you have not
borne Office your self, speak not of a Magistrate, least your wonder prove a
triflle, when the secret is well considered.


Fran. True, but who would not wonder to see wise men so foolish, the wealthy
so mad, and the poor so desperate, that the false God of gold should so
bewitch the heart of man, as to make the sentence of law to cut off the line of
life? But to confess a troth, I think God has his working in all things, and
therefore it is but a folly to wonder at any thing: and therefore leave all
things to his will, who does all things to his glory, and to go on with my
wonders, I will tell you: It was my hap to travail into a country town, or
pretty village, where I lodged in an Inn, at the sign of the wild goose:
where, walking in the back side, I saw a dozen of pretty fine chickins, when
looking well upon them, an unhappy boy (meaning to play the knave kindly with
me) told me, that in the morning all those chickins would be Lambs: Go to
boy quoth I, do not lie I pray thee: In truth Sir (quoth he) it is true: at
the first (a little concealing my displeasure conceived against the boy) I
wondered at his speech, but in the morning I found it true: and was not this a
wonder?


Lor. No mary Sir, it is no wonder that the goodman of the house being called
Lamb, but the chickins should be all Lambs: but since you are entr^d into
merry wonders to beguile you^ friends with a jest, let me se^l you a little of
some of my home wonders.


Fran. With all my heart: the more the better, ^ne for an other.


Lor. In the town where I dwell, we have a pretty Corporation, where among
many poor Officers, M. Constable is no mean man, especially upon a Festiual
day, when he has his Tipstaff in his hand, and the Stocks at his door: Now,
it fell out one day that the chief of the Parish having a meeting at the
Church, this honest man (at least, so reputed of the simple sort) putting on
his best countenance, and taking his place amongst the best of his neighbors:
it fell out, that in hearing of a controuers^e between two sorrye fellows,
about the pounding of a white Mare, whither by law it might be done or not, one
giving his opinion upon the one side, and the other upon the other: at last the
Constable giving a sore speech against the poor men* that the one for his
cruelty, in that he had almost starued the Mare in the pound, and the other for
his folly, to let her stray into his neighbors ground, should be set in the
stocks, and the^e to stay till they were made friends, without farther trying
of the law: had no sooner ended his speech, but from a man became a Hog: and
was not this a wonder?


Fran. A great one, but that Lawrence Hog, if it b^ he that I take it you
speak of, who was the last year Constable of your Hundredth, was ever a good
ryder, and therefore had ever more pity on one good paced Mare, then two
roaned curtalles: but if your Trenchmore be done, let me hear if you have
such another dance?


Lor. Nay by your leave sir, I will first hear you as good as your word, one
for an other till the Sun go down, and then put up.


Fran. Content, well remembered, then let me tell you: in a certain Port town,
where it was my hap to lodge for some few days, it was my chance diverse
times to meet with a strange creature, in the shap^ of a man, of whom one day
standing at a door all alone, I took good notice: of stature, he was neither
above the Moon, nor beneath the Earth, but in the middle region of the
proportion of man, mary for his face it was made like one of the four winds
in a Map, that should blow over the stoutest May Pole in a Country: a pair
of staring eyes, that would look three mile beyond Mount Noddy, and a mouth
hell wide, that would swear like a devil: but for that he would not be
troubled with too much hair, he had forsworn a beard: of complexion, like
rusty Bacon, and nosed like the s^oute of an old Bear: necked like a Bull,
shouldred like a Miller, and legged like the Mill-poast: and for an arm, had
it not been iniur^d with a rewine (that he took with a hot service in a
moorish Country) he had been able with a little help, to have thrown a
lowse over his shoulder: apparelled he was like a decayed Soldier, and yet
kept a march in the street, as though he had led more then meant to follow
him: Now this lus^y gallant, that gave the wall to no man, but upon condition
of a quarrel, nor put off his cap to any man, but of whom he meant to borrow
money: having passed a few days in such a pride, as few of good fashion
could away withal, wanting means to supply his wantes, fell in hand (after
many shifts) to try the trade of the high way: where having made so many happy
purchases, as would have paid for ^ good Coppy-holde, would not give over his
^h^se till he was taken napping in his hunting: it fell out, that being over
taken in his match, or ouer-matched in his taking, he was taken hold of by
the Officer and brought before a Justice for a Fellon, from whom to the
prison, and so by degrees to the gallows: now, where before that time he^ was
held for a gallant fellow, and a proper man, he no sooner came to execution,
but he became presently a Wolf: and was not this a great wonder?


Lor. True, if it had not been Haukin Wolf, the swaggering rascal of hemp
Alley, but I wonder he lived so long vnhanged, who had deserved it so often:
but it is no matter, let him go, I am sure you are like to hear as good a
Morris dance from my Pype, and therefore have at you: In the City where I use
to make my household provision for the year, it was my hap in the Inn where
I lay, to be lodged next wall to a minikin girl, brother betwixt the eyes then
the heels: This dainty come-to-it, thinking her brass good silver, in an
humor (twenty years short of her age) would forsooth (to continue or increase
her beautye) use all the art, that either the Physician or the Paynter could
help her for her avail: and to note the variety of the countenaunces, she
would in a glass, teach her ill favored face to put on (it was a wonder to
think upon) one while she would look as demurely, as a Rabbet that had newly
washed her face in a deawy morning: by and by she would draw the great lips
of a wide mouth so near together, that it was very much like the neck of an
Oxes bladder, and yet with that face would she so simper it, as though she
would put the Millers Mare quite out of countenance: by and by, she would leere
a side like a Bear whelp, and with a trice she would frown, as though she
were sick of the frets: turn her head, and she would laugh, as if she had
been tickled in the lower ribs: but after many of these faces, she would at
last stand a tip-toe, and vaunt it like the Queen of Spades: but if she tried
to make a curtsie, why maid^ Marian in a Maurice dance, would put her down for
a fiddle faddle: This Mistress Needens (as I said before) nothing fair, but
faced very ill fauouredly, wickedly witty, but nothing wise, s^w at her window
a Gentlewoman sitting at her door, with a white Sparrow pearching on her
finger, which bird skipped from thence upon the ruff of a fine young Gentleman
that sat by her, and there took bread out of his mouth: Now what humor this
wicked creature had, heerupon to be transformed, I know not, but wishing that
she might be in this Sparrows place, she no sooner came out of her house, but
she became a Sparrow indeed: and was not this a wonder?


Fran. Yes, and that no small one, but that I think Meg Sparrow of
Kent-streete, was the gentle mistress that you made your wonder of: but to quit
you with the like strange matter, you shall hear: in a certain thorough fair
town, where it was my hap to lodge for a night or two, at a strange sign,
mine Host of the house being a Bailiffe of the hundredth:


Lor. Oh then he was like to be an honest man.


Fran* Yea, and so he was I may t^ll you, for he played the honest man many a
time, to he^pe many an honest man to his money, that many a knave would have
run away with, if he had not been, and help^ many a wen^h to a father for her
child, that could not else have told how to have done for the keeping of it:
But to go on with my tale, this gallant Sir, being for his capacity able to
judge betwixt black and white, horse or cow, whosoever were the owner: and
for his person; as good a Picture as might have served for a need, to have
hanged at his sign poast, standing commonly in his door like a Bearard, that
was acquainted with all the dogs of the parish, standing as I say with a
Sarazins face, his nose too long for his lips, his cheeks like the jaws of a
horse, his eyes like a Smithes forge, and his hair all besprinckled with a
whore frost, this S. Christopher shouldred swad, that fed on nothing but
brows, and ^appy Ale, having more cappes of poor men, then either crowns or
pence to relieve them, fell (saving your reverence) in love, with such a piece
of horseflesh as you spoke of, and notwithstanding that he had a pretty pincke
to his own wedded wife, that could answer her guests at all weapons, and at
all hours, yet he^ as a wicked Ram that would follow a s^abbed sheep, fell
in hand with this rotten Ewe; whom (his wife being at the market) he got into
his garden, where near under my window I might see him sloute her in such
sort, and wiping his driueled beard, clapped her on y^ lips so stoutely, as if
the devil and his damme had met upon a close hellish bargain: Now, after a
hobby horse turn or two, in they came into the house, where he conuayed his
welfauoured mistress into a place of private conference, where long he had not
tarryed, but in comes my Hostess, who knowing by her Oven where cakes had
been a baking, meeting her gooseman with this his pretty ducke in his hand,
began with a note above Ela to sing them such a solfa, that what with knave and
whore, and a great deal more, had not I and some other of her kind guests
persuaded her to patience: Iealousse would have made her nails to have bin
indicted of bloodshed, but as it fell out when she had chid her self black in
the mouth, and at the last with a little little patience sat her down, with,
out of my house whore, and by cocks stones, bones I would have said, I will
not bear it: after she had cried a little for cursed heart, and wipte her nose
of a little rewme, with these words she made an end: oh thou old mangy,
fiery faced, bottle nose, horse lipped, Ox Iawed rascal, thou town Bull, and
common Bore, that seruest for all the S^ine in the Parrish, a pox take thee,
do thou think to make me take the leauinges of thy Trulles? thou shall be
hanged first, go hang thy self, get thee to them where thou will, for thou
shall not make my house a Stews, nor me a bawd any longer I warrant thee. I
have heard that in old time men have been turned into Beasts, I would thou
were so too: and truly it is a sore matter that may fall out upon an evil
tongu^, especially an evil woman's, for you shall see what fell out upon this
wicked creatures curse: the man amazed at her madness, and not able (for all
his Office) to take order with her tongue, glad (after he had shipped away hi^
ware) to be got himself out of her sight: no sooner turned his back to go
out of door, but he became presently a great Bull: and was not this a strange
wonder?


Lor. Not a whit so long as I know Thomas Bull of the Rams horn at the
nether end of the market place, as you ride through Cuckoldes End, a mile from
Twattoxbury: but if you will give me leave a little, I will quit you with as
good a tale. It was my hap in an odd village, where for a few days, I meant
to recreate my self with my go^d friends, to come forsooth to a Country
wedding: which being upon a poor Saints day, for either it was a poor Saint,
that they meant so poor^ an honor to, or the parish was very poor, that the
people had no better clothes to put on: for saving that it was whole and
clean that little that they had, there was neither waste of stuff, nor
finenesse to be found fault withal: yet as it was, let me tell you: the manner
was worth the marking: For first and foremost went the Bride, for flesh and
blood as foul a creature as might fit the Invention of an Inuectiue against
Beauty: who though she were squinte eyed, Swine s^outed, wry bodyed, and splay
footed, yet had she such a garlic b^^ath, that they had need enough of
Rosemary, that led such a weed by the wrist: but let her pass, she with her
hair about her shoulders, drawn out like a horse tail with a Manecombe, in a
homespun russet Petticoate, that should serve her many a fair day, with a
pair of strong Calue-skinne gloves, that her good man had dressed for the
purpose, holding out her chinne and dra^ing in her mouth (like Malkins old
Mare) went simpring betwixt two old Constables: and after the rowte of such a
fight of Rascals, as one would ^ake hell for such a rabblement, follows the
Groom my young Colt of a Cart breed, led betwixt two girls for the purpose,
the one as like an Owl, the other as like an Vrchin, as if they had been
spitte out of the mouths of them: Now this sweet youth, saving that he had
the shape of a man, there could be little said in his commendation: for as he
was headed like a Gian^, so was h^ faced like an old Ape, stumpe footed, and
wry legged, and withal, his lower limbe^ of such sma^nesse, that he went in
great danger of the wind: mary for his breath, his Bride and he were both
Rabbets of one Laier: yet being in this disgrace of nature, these well matched
Hog minions, it was a sport to see the weak judgment of their poor wits, who
were content to persuade themselves, there was matter in them of sufficiency:
for she, if one saluted her with fair Maid,


Fran. Not at all, for Hodge Buzzard and his best beloved, at the blew Crow
and the red Owl can ^el you the meaning of this riddle: but now to quit you
again have with you.

It was my hap in a market town near unto the cross, to meet with a coarse,
carried upon men's shoulders in a coffiin, no great solemnity there was to be
noted, for there was not a Herald of Arms, nor any mention made of him more
then that he was dead; and was carried to be buried: for more then that men
wore black in good Cloakes for him, I saw no sign of sorrow to be thought on:
yet for that there were many that accompanied the coarse, I demanded of some
that I durst be bold with, what he was* h^s name, his state, his condition,
and his death? Now o^ all that I asked, or of all that I spoke to, I could not
here so much as a good word spoken of him, his name was Di^es, he was a rich
man, his condition wicked and malicious, his quallity ledge^^ ^^^aine, with
which he would coozen a whole country* his state mighty by his purse, his
life like a Hog, and his death like a Dog, but that he scape^ hanging, which
he deserved too often: he was beloved of few, and hated of many: undid a
number in his life, and now only bestowed a little Charitably at his death:
many did curse him, and few that prayed for him, more then that they might
here no more of him, and all that I could here or see written of him, was an
^pi^^ph that some conceited friend did bestow upon him* the words whereof
we^e these: Here lie^ one that was borne and cried: he l^ued threescore
year^s, and then fell sick and died. Now seeing no more matter to be
considered, but down right Dog, with his head in the po^, and yet such a deal
of a do in carring hm to church, I thought I would see him thrown into the
earth, but when the carcass came to be laid in the g^aue, he that in his
life was said to be a jolly square fellow and indifferent handsome man, became
a most ugly Bear, and was not this a wonder?


Fran. No, not any wonder at all, when Barnabye Bear of Bull End by hog down
was the most ravening Wolf, and devouring wretch of his neig^bours goods that
lived in a whole country: but if he be gone, no doubt he has left heirs,
and so let him go: and now let me tell you of another wonder: In a certain
City where it was my chance to make aboade for some few months, I espied
one day among a company of Citizens, a little remote from the company, a
couple that for serious c^^se of conference had single^ them selves together,
where walking near unto a bench where I sat, I might hear a little of their
discourses: of which, before I spe^ke any thing, let me a little describe you
the persons: First, the young man, being about the age of some two and twenty,
a handsome man of reasonable good shape, smooth faced, and demure countenanced,
his apparel most Silk and Velvet, his cloak and his hat well brushed, his
ruffes well set, his stockings well gartered and his shoes well blacked, a
sprinke youth, that as far as his mon^y would serve him, did prick toward
the Merchant: the other somewhat more stepped in years, and faced somewhat like
a Bull, saving that he would leere like a Lyme-hound, his apparel nothing
costly^, nor very comel^, cloth and fustian, and that of ^is wives spinning,
his daughers ^a^ding, and his cousens Weauing, his hat well worn and vnlyned,
his ruff but a length of home linen, his shoes the best of the hyde, as well
for warmth as wearing, his girdle of Buffe leather, a dagger with a dudgion
haste, a greasy ^ouch with a ru^ty ring, his st^^kings of exce^ding course
wool, and his shoes soundly cobbled: this was all that I could note in his
outside, now for his inside, let me tell you, there was shrewde matter to muse
upon as you shall hear: for th^se two (age and youth) thus pacing the street
with a close measu^e, I followed till they came to a Tavern door, wh^re going
into a private room, with the door shut to them, I clapped me into an odd^
seat near unto them, where calling for a pint of Wine, leaving an idle
errand at the Bar, that if John a Sul^^came to ask for Tom a Hedge, he
should be presently brought to me, sitting munching upon a crust, and sipping
^ow and then of a cup of Wine, I heard all their confe^ence, which was as
^olloweth.

The old (...) it seemed) thick o^ hearing ^ because ^e would be (...) spoken
to, spoke very loud unto thi^ youth* when the first that I could hear was
this* well son, you would hau^ money, and I could well part with it, if I
saw ^eason to persuade me^* how either ^o benefit my self or you by it: for
it is a Bird that flies fast forward, but ^t sildome comes so fast home
again: and if you change him into an other shape then his own, he does
often loose much of his virtue: if you put him into any thin^ he may happen
turn to nothing. For (let me see) you would have four hundredth p^undes, let
me hear to what profitable use you would employ them? The young man (with as
soft voice as could serve his thick eare^) mad^ him this answer.

Si^, I would put one hundredth pound in cloth, which I will adventure beyond
the Seas, or fell at home, to my great advantage. Stay quoth the old man,
cloth is good ware, so i^ be well ma^e, and well bought, but if you have no skill
in wool^, you may be cousoned in your cloth: besides, if it be good, and you
adventure it (mark me well) the sea is no brook, and winds are wavering,
storms are perilous, rocks and sands are mischievous, Pirates are villainous,
and what ship but may catch a Leake? but say that wind, weather, ship and
sail, were as prosperous as heart could wish, to make a happy voyage, yet the
goods on shore, the charge of custom, the time of vent, the expense of
carriage, may make the commodity so little, as without the better stock, may
quickly kill a young Merchant: And again, if y^ Creditor prove banckrout, or
the Factor a s^endthrift, then Summa totalis makes but a sorrowful reckoning:
Now at home, if they be stretched upon y^ tentor-hooks, burnt in y^ dying,
spoiled in y^ dressing, or any other false matter fall upon the^, and you sell
the^ for good, y^ buyer is cousoned, and your conscience is touched, and ^od
will one day have it answ^red, and therefore I doubt you will do little good
with it in cloat^: With that the young man replied: oh sir, nothing v^^ter
nothing have, there is no fishing to the Sea, the gain of one voyage will bear
the loss of many, and a Factor* of credit will never trust but upon
assurance: and therefore the undoing of one man must not be the hindrance of a
hundredth: if I live among men I must do as men do: and for home sale, if all
things be not as they should be, they must be as they may be: every one mus^
line by his trade, for in these days he that stands upon conscience may look
after commodity, and come not near it by an arms length: why quoth the old
man, do you get so much by meating? the^ you do not mean to go to heaven for
you measure: Alas Sir quoth the youth, in the Church perhaps we hear of
heaven, but in ^ur shops we have so much of the world to look to, that we
have almost no leisure to think of heaven nor hell: but yet I hope so long as
we pitch and pay, and follow the trade or occupation we were brought up in,
we shall not go to hell for a a small matter. No quoth the old man, but for
a great matter you may, and you that should love your neighbor, to betray him
as a ^udas, how ever you think of it, I fear it will fall foul with you one
day: but since I see you are given to thrive, though I would be loath to take
part with you in your course, I care notif I deal with you for one hundredth
pounds, to be employed in cloth: but what say you to the second? to what use
will you put the other hundredth? The other hundredth quoth the young man, I would
put in wines, an excellent commodity, and ready money, and quick return. Alas
quoth the old man, it is pity the return is so quick, for I think there is
more money wasted in drinking to healthes, till all health be turned to
sickness, then is employed in many necessary good occasions: but let every man
answer for his own sin* my sorrow can help little: and therefore if you be
sure of good wines* speedy vent and good chapmen, I think it be not the worst
ware that you can deal withal: but if your wines be small hedge wines, or
have taken salt water, and you ^ither by brewing them with milk water, or
other trumperies, or by mingling one with another, and so mar both to help
one, and yet get money into your hands, give day, and protest friendship, and
all to cheat a simple man, whose taste and his wit, are both a like for his
bargain: oh how can you drink wine, but you must think of your wickedness?
and then how it goes down God knows, and I fear some of ye feel too well.
Well Sir quoth the young man, I tell you as I told you before, every man must
look to himself, and therefore if you will deal with only men of conscience,
you may keep your money long enough ere it will do you any good: and therefore
since it is an ill wind that blows no man to good, let the drunkard make
himself poor, and the Uintiler rich, and the Merchant vent his commodity, as
he may continue his Traffic: I cannot stand upon ^e^nies, for your money you
shall have securi^y, which if you like not, let me be without. Nay soft quoth
the old man, for kindreds, ^akerou^en, I would not stick with you upon your
own bond, but that we are all mortal, and if you dye, your suer^y may be the
more careful of your discharge and his own to: and therefore Cosen, I pray
you in kindness tell me for your third hundredth* how you will employ it? Sir
quoth he, at your request I am content to tell you, in an Office: An Office
quoth the old man, in the name of God man what may it be? why sir quoth he, the
keeping of a Iayle or prison: for if I live but a few years, I will make mine
Irons, and my Tap-house, quickly put my money in my purse, with advantage: and
besides my ordinary gains of my diet, my fees allowed, besides privy
commodities, will soon multiply my hundredth to a greater sum then I will
speak of: Oh but Cosen quoth the old man, when you see the misery of the
poor, and think on the sorrows of the distressed, how can you sleep in your
bed, to think of the day that is to be looked for? Oh Cosen, be sure this
world is but a picture, where pleasure or pain, is but as a shadow of that
which is to come ^ remember my good cosen what will be spoken at the latter
day, when you may well say you have visited the sick, for you see your
prisoners for your own safety: but how you have fed the hungry, or clothed
the naked, I pray God your conscience do not come against you: In brief,
cosen I had rather give thee a hundredth pounds to leave it, then lend thee a
penny to take it: Sir quoth the young man, I thank you, but patience rather
then pity, has been ever the way to profit: the small grass of the field
fills the barn full of hay, and the poor men's money fills the rich man's purse:
he that will not kill a sheep because he will not see his blood, may hap to be
without meat for his dinner, and why should I pity him that has no pity of
him self* yet pe^hap^ I may make that gain of the wilful, that need not
come near me y^ may make me comfort them that cannot go from me: corruption
you know has a part in ^ur nature, whose infection breeds diverse effects of
evil* and who lives without sin? and therefore if rich men will be beggars,
and beggars make rich men, give me leave to take my course, I will leave you to
your good conscience. Oh cosen be not a blood sucker, there is other meat
then Mutton, and therefore pray not upon Lambs, and if you can, endure the cry
of the miserable, yet in what you can be comfortable, and if the wilful be
woeful, yet be not you joyful, but to all distressed be pitiful, and put
away that corruption, that may breed an eternal confusion: put not the poor
to his Irons, least they eat with sorrow into his soul, nor detain the
woeful in misery, leas^ you be shut out of the gates of mercy: howsoever
Justice command execution, use you commiseration: and so since I see your
intent, I will not put you from your purpose: but to the last hundredth deal
(as plainly) what will you do with it? In brief Sir quoth the young man, I
will put it out upon interest, where (by such plots as I can work) I will get
four score in the hundredth, and perhaps my hundredth again: that were a wonder
quoth the old man, but is not this interest you speak of plain usury? No sir
quoth the youth, not plain, but in plain truth, where there is no truth, it
is privy* Usury: As how quoth the old man? Why sir quoth the youth, when my
petty Brokers, seekers for young spend-thriftes* hear of a youth new come to
his land, that is ready to sell it ere he know the rent of it, upon him go
they: to me they come for some commodity, either an Artificial stone, that
must pass for an Oriental Jewel: a rare piece of Silk, that will scarce
hold the cutting out: a lame horse though stand right for a little way: and
these with ^any other such tricks must be foysted into a little money to make
up a hundredth pounds, for which he shall be surely lapt in bonds sufficient to
hold him fast: then ere he come to have his money, my Broker must have his
share, his Seller must have his share, and the S^riuenor must have more then
for his writings for his share, out of al which shares I must have a share,
besides the commodity of my money, and badware, and yet I must seem an honest
man, and of good co^^cience, that will not take above y^ Statute for any thing:
but thus we share the Spendthriftes money among us, and if he break his day,
as it is ^ddes he will, then new double bo^des, and new shares for the
forbearaunce: till thus with our sharing, we leave him but a little to share
from us: Alas quoth the old man why you were as good take his purse by the high
way* oh no she quoth the youth, it is ^arre better and easier thus to meet
with his money by a by way: we that thus ^eede upon the folly of youth, are
but ordained to be tho scourges of Prodigality: and when auerice has once
bewitched the mind with wealth, it is but labor lost to persuade reason to
leave it: and therefore Cosen, though by your countenance it agree not with
your conscience, bear with me to tell you truly my intent* Oh cosen quoth the
old man, truly this last part is the w^^st of all the play, and therefore
since I see your intentin every one of these courses, rather to deceive the
simple, then to make an honest gain, I had as lieue keep my money in my purse,
as employ it to such kind of profit* if I may see a good bargain wherein you
may honestly benefit your self, without cheating or wicke^ cunning, upon your
own bon^ without suerty; I am for you for a hundredth pounds. Sir quoth he, I
thank you, but if you be so scrupelous, I mean not to ^roubl^ you: that is as
you please cosen quoth the old man* so ca^^ing for a reckoning of a Pint of
Muska^ine, or such a matter, out they go together: who no ^ooner were out of
doors, but they became both Gurne^ds: and was not this a wonder?


Fran. Yes if t^^y had been sowst, but as they were, it was no wonder (...)
ol^e William Gurnerd of Frinsly Borough, and hi^ ^ousen Henry Gurnerd of Arnix
with him, the one as honest and kind an old Farmer, and the other as fine and
wise a youth for his time, as one should meet w^^h among a thousand: but since
the Sun grows ^ow, I will quit you with one wonder of mine, and so give over
till we meet again.


Lor. Con^ent, ^se your discretion, as time and my memory serves, I will
either give over or requite you.


Fran. Well then you shall understand, that it was my ha^ in a kind of house,
betwixt a Tavern and an ^lehouse, where all sorts of people might have ware
for their money,


Lor. Oh by your leave a little, was it not a kind of a Burdell, a brothell,
or a baudy house?


Fran. Fie man you speak too broad, for where a man may be merry for his
money, is there no meat think you but laced Mutton? and if a kind wench play
the good fellow, must Master Constable needs be angry? it is a heavy hearing.


Lor. Yea when the belly grows so big, that the burden must lie upon the
parish.


Fra. Away man, that is the w^rst, but if men were not hard hearted, women
might be better dealt withal.


Lor. Come, you will one day be caught napping for your fine humor: but I pray
you on with your wonder.


Fran. Why I will tell you: sitting in this foresaid tippling tapling house,
gnawing upon a crust, longer then I had need, and making many sips o^ a pot of
Ale, having a faggot before me, which I meant to sit the burning out of, I
heard in the next room (somewhat closer then where I sat) two or three
laughing very heartily, and as through a creuice in the boords I might espy
them, I saw a fat queen with a double chin, set betwixt a couple of leering
companions, at the least crafty knaves: where laying mine ear a little to the
wall, I heard all their chat, which was as I will tell you: Cosen quoth one of
them (to this Fubs) by this drink (and then he fecht me off a whole Can, that
his eye^ stared with his draft) this money was well got: why I got forty
shillings of M. you wot who, for only telling of him where the widow of the
Eagle dwelt, setting her out, to be all in the pinners papers, in the
thousands at least, and a house so furnished, it would do ones heart go^d to
come in it, and for a Wife the world had not a kinder creature: now, to her I
made a train by her cosen my neighbor, to be so acquainted with her, that
after I had got into a little that with her, I set her in such a gogge for a
husband, with setting out this Gentleman to be so gallant a man, so goodly a
man, so fine a man, so kind a man, so loving a man, so courteous a man, so
proper a man, and so brave a man, that besides his living which was more then
hers by a great deal, his creadit was such with the great ones, that she
should go in her Hood every day, and lead a life like a Lady at the least: Now
when with these words, I had set them both in such tune, that I knew how to
have the drawing of both their purse stringes, when I had so long plumed upon
his feath^rs, that they began to grow too fast for getting off, then finding
an old Archer instead of a Suitor, that noting my acquaintance with the
Widow, would make a profit of my travail, to him fell I, and giving over my
young gallant, fell aboard with his bounty, and having him in bond (beside his
daily liberality) that ^f he gat the widow, I should have the hundredth
pounds, to work went I with my wits, to bring this world about: and one day
sitting with the widow in sad talk, after she had asked me of my youth, (with
a sigh) I answered that he was well, and if that she would be secret, I would
acquaint her with that which should make her think me an honest man: she not
caring what she said, to hear what I would say, promised secrecy: whereupon I
began to play my part kindly: Alas widow quoth I (to deal plainly with you)
my friend and I must be two, for whereas I thought him the most honest, and
stayed kind Gentleman, and good husband in the world, I find he is a wencher,
and a spend-thrift, and so hasty that nere a friend he has but is weary of
his company, and withal (I may tell you) he is in debt, truly I have bin sorry
at my heart, that I wa^ was so deceived in him, to open my mouth in his
commendation, especially to a woman of your worth, who it were pity that he
should live, to look upon more then as a stranger: but I hope there is nothing
so far past but may be called back again? No quoth she I warrant you, I will
look to that well enough, and I am glad I hear of it so soon, and I thank
you with all my heart: oh these young men are dangerous to deal withal: indeed
(as they say) they will make much of one, for they will make as much of one as
they can, and then leave us to make our prayers at whining cross, but I will
leave them all and be ruled by my friends, I am not so young, but I can make
much of an old man, and love him to, if he use me well, for I see by my
neighbors, it is better being an old man's darling then a young man's
worldling: say you so Mistress quoth I, and truly if you be so minded, I warrant
you I will fit you with a gentleman for your turn: one, that though he be
somewhat in years, yet is he as staite an old man, and as neat in his
apparel, as if he were but twenty years of age: one that loved his old wife
out of cry, he has but one daughter, and she is married, so that he has no
charge to trouble him: and for his wealth, he knows no end of his goods:
Yea quoth the widow, such a one were worth the looking on, and for the honesty
that I have found in you, I will think the better of you while I know you,
welcome to me at all times, and bring your friend, it may be he shall not
mislike his entertainment: with these good words, I took my leave, and after
many thanks, making her believe wonders, about my villainy went I, and being
well acquainted with a cosen of hers, who was to pay her a sum of money,
which should be forgiven him by this old man, if he could get her, we made
such means, that with the good help of her kinsman, who lent this
Cunny-catching cunning companion, both money and wares for his furniture: we
found such times, and made such meetings, that we clapped up a wicked bargain:
and for my pains (what care I for the undoing of her and him, and twenty more,
to serve my turn) I gat these crowns, and will have more to them ere it be
long: and be hanged you will quoth goodwife Bumble Be, but sir worst thou
what? I Will tell thee as pretty a tale: in my house (thou know) I have them,
that will carry meat in their mouths, and not loose a bone for a shadow: now
upon some month a go, I entertained a young gossip, that was not such a baby,
but she knew how to but^er her bread, and yet the vilde baggadge (because she
was somewhat snowte fair) would be a little proud and foolish withal, she
would be for no Churl, nor Chappes, she was a minion for a Champion: yea but
daughter quoth I, we cannot keep house with fair looks, we must have money,
and the Churl at home will be liberal abroad, and the Chuffe will bring better
prouander the^ Chafe, where he means to bait: be content, a purse of gold
is worth ten pipes of Tobacco, please an old man's humor, and have his heart:
these youths of the parish, that are so spruse in their apparel, have little
money in their purses, and their verses and their tales, are not worth a
pudding for our trade: the basket with cakes, the pee^es of stuffes, the
Jewels, and the gold, this is it that maintains the matter* talk is but
wind, there is nothing to be borrowed on it, leave your idle humor, or you
will live but ill fauouredly: Now sir, how she listened to me I know not, or how
she profited in my instruction, but an old Widower coming to my house
(instead of the common course that he might have taken) fell into so great a
liking of her beauty, that leaving to fall aboard with her for, and so
forsooth, began to tell her how great a pity it was that so sweet a creature,
in face and body, should have so foul a mind: and if that rather need of
maintenance, then wicked delight, did drive her to this lewd kind of life,
and that he might be persuaded of her loathing and leaving her ill course, his
wealth was sufficient: children he had none, and to bring her to good he cared
not to spend half that he had, she should be wife, child, love, and perhaps
heir to the best part of that he had: this sound in her ear, so went to her
heart, that by such means as he wrought, my girl was got away, and my house
almost overthrown by it, for I may tell you she was a diamond wench, for
color and countenance, and wit at will: but when this Widower had wedded her,
and she began to look about her, she was so turned honest, that it was a
wonder how she could hit on it: but to be short, one day (not past a week a
go) she sent for me, and her good man being abroad, she gat me alone with her
into a chamber, where after a shower of tears: oh quoth she, leave leave your
wicked and hellish life, it may last a while, but the end will be naught:
Virgins virginityes, young men's patrimonies, old men's wealths, lost, sold,
and wasted, bodies diseased, minds troubled, hearts agreeued, and souls
tormented, hell in the house, and the deu^l in every corner: take ho^de I say of
a fair warning, let the shame of nature, the hurt of reason, the abuse of
time, and the offense of grace, make you loath this vileness, and leave this
villainy, devised by the devil, and enacted but by his angels: God is where he
was, he has called me home, follow me to him, break up your ill company, and
fall to your prayers, if you want come to me, I will not see you want, but if
you will not take this kindly, and follow it soundly, I will leave you utterly,
have you deadly, and persecute you most cruelly: Now, when she had made an
end, she stung me so to the heart, tha^ I was not able to answer her a word a
good while, but at last coming to my self, I did thank her* and told her,
that she should see I would think on her, whereupon she gave me this gold,
and by this gold so I have, for I have put two away, and the rest shall follow
as fast as may be, for I will turn christian, and do thou Hodge too, and in
good earnest if thou will do as I will do, we will strike a bargain: thou
have been a knave, and art sorry for it, I have been a drab, and am ashamed of
it, let us leave al knavery and swear honesty, we shall do more good with
them that know us when they see us, then a thousand of them that look upon us,
and will not believe us: Well Madge quoth the Cheator, thou have almost turning
my heart in my belly with this talk of thine, and truly I will soon come
home to thee, when it shall be thy fault if we iumpe not upon the maine point,
but what means my Cosen Rainolde to change color and sit so sad? Oh cosen
quoth he, I here you talk of a mendment, and rejoice to hear it, but when I
think withal upon mine own wickedness, it pricks me to the heart to remember
it: Oh the false and counterfeit wares y^ I have sold to simple chapmen in the
country, where as well in loss of wares, as by imprisonment for breach of
payment, I have undone a number, and the goods of diverse honest men that I gat
into my hands, and then closely (to cosen my creditors) played banckrout
without need: Oh Cosen when I kept Shop if a poor Gentleman had broke day
with me but for forty shillings, I would have defamed him, with shifter and
beggar, and I know not what, but when I had undone I know not how many, and yet
all would not thrive with me, what shall I do? Why Cosen, ask God mercy for
your sins, of that which you have, pay as far as it will go, or employ it to
such good use, as may in time make satisfaction, no doubt but God will be
merciful, you will thrive and prosper, and your conscience will be at quiet:
say you so Cosen quoth he, I thank you with all my heart, and since I have
neither wife nor Children, if ye two make a match, I care not if I spend the
residue of my life in your company, I will be a lodger in your house, and we
will live and die like friends: upon this they clapped hands, called for their
reckonings, and departed, when going out of the doors, the men were both
turned to Plouers, and the woman to an Howlate: and think you not this a
wonder?


Lor. No it is no wonder, that William Plouer and his cosen Roger of Mallets
moore, and Sib Howlate of Nilcocks Marsh, should meet at Bulley Market, and
drink a Pot of Ale at the Mag Pie: but for the wonder it was in their talk
and turning honest, if the tale be true as you tell it, but look you, the
Sun goes low, it is time to be walking, let us keep the rest of our
wonders till our next meeting.


Fran. Content, and it shall go hard* but I will be for you: in the mean
time farewell.


Lor. A^ue.


FINIS.
