Robert Norton to the courteous Readers.
ALthough I have too often been an unwilling witness of the ouer-rash
disposition of diverse unadvised censurers, that would have themselves esteemed
skillful, and yet either will not, or rather cannot do any thing of worth
themselves, not sparing to cavil, detract, and injuriously to burden other
men's well pretended endeavors, with unworthy and undeserved scoffs and
scandalls: but in stead of reading to understand, and then to examine their
true validity, that so with judgment they might censure them, have
crittically played the right Momes: And though I hope not as Jack alone, to
escape that which few or none have done before me: yet the respect I have to
the public good, that you my Countrymen, such as either want leisure or
language, may become partakers of these excellent inventions of that famous
foreign Author, more prevailing with me, then the careless regard I have
of such injuries could hinder, I have, as you see, adventured to provide for
this worthy stranger, this English welcome, and have preferred some few of mine
own friends (though unworthy) to accompany him: And so commending him to your
courteous entertainements, do bid you heartily farewell.

Yours in all courtesy, R. N.

DEFINITIONS appertaining to Arithmeticall whole Numbers.
The first Definition.
ARithmeticke is the Science of Numbers.

The second Definition.
NVmber is that which expresses the quantity of each thing.

The third Definition.
THe Characters by which Numbers are denoted, are ten; namely, 0 signifying the
beginning of Number? and 1, and 2, and 3, and 4, and 5, and 6, and 7, and 8,
and 9.

The fourth Definition.
EVery three Characters of a Number is called a Member, whereof the first are
the three first toward the right hand, the second, the three Characters next
following toward the left hand: And so by order, for the third Member and
others following, as many as there shall be found threes in the Number
propounded.

The Explication.
AS in the number 357876297, the 297 is called the first Member: and 876 the
second: and 357 the third.

The fifth Definition.
THe first Character of the first Member, beginning from the right hand to the
left, does simply signify his own value: the second, so many times ten, as
that contains unities: the third, so many times a hundred, as that contains
unities: and the first Character of the second Member so many times a thousand,
as that contains unities: and so by the tenth progression of all the rest of
the Characters contained in the number proposed.

Explication.
LEt the Number propounded be 756871387130789276. Then according to this
definition, the first Character 6, makes six: and the 7 following (...) and
the 2 following, two hundred: and the 9, nine thousand and so of the rest. To
express thi^ ^umber, place over every first Character of each Member (except
the first Member) a prick or point, as you see above: then say, seven hundred
fifty six thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand, (namely, so many
times thousand, as there are pricks or points from 7 to the end) eight hundred
seventy one thousand thousand thousand thousand, three hundred eighty seven
thousand thousand thousand, one hundred thirty thousand thousand, seven hundred
eighty nine thousand, two hundred seventy six.

The sixth Definition.
A Whole number is either a unity, or a compounded multitude of unities.

The seventh Definition.
THe Golden Rule, or Rule of three, is that by which to three terms given,
the fourth proportional term is found.

The operation of Arithmeticall whole Numbers.
Of the Addition of whole Numbers. The first Problem.
ARithmeticall whole numbers being given to find their Sum, Explication
propounded, let the Numbers given to be added, be 379, and 7692, and 4545,
Explication required, to find their sum. Construction: the Numbers given,
shall be disposed as follows: ^ so as their first Characters toward the
right hand, stand directly one under another: and likewise their second
Characters, and so also the rest following, drawing under them a line: then
shall all the Characters of the first rank toward the right hand be added,
saying, 9 and 2 make 11, and 5 make 16, whereof the 6 shall be placed under the
first rank, and the 1 of the same 16, shall be added to the second rank,
saying, 1 and 7 make 8, and 9 make 17, and 4 make 21. of which the 1 shall be
placed directly under the second rank, and the 2 shall be added to the third
rank, saying, 2 and 3 make 5, and 6 make 11, and 5 make 16, whereof the 6
shall be placed under the third rank, and the 1 shall be added to the fourth,
saying, 1 and 7 make 8, and 4 make 12, which shall be wholly placed in their
rank thus.

I say, 12616 is the sum required. ^

Demonstration: if from the three Numbers given, the two first be taken away,
and there remains 4545. And if from the Sum 12616, the two first given be
subtracted also, there remains likewise 4545: But by the common Axiom, if
from things equal, equal things be subtracted, their rests shall be equal:
And things subtracted equal to things subtracted, all shall be equal.
Therefore, 12616 is equal to three Numbers given, which is the thing required.
Conclusion: Arithmeticall whole Numbers being given to be added, we have found
their sum as was required.

Substraction of whole Numbers. The second Problem.
AN Arithmeticall whole Number being given, out of which to substract, and
another Arithmeticall whole Number to be subtracted: to find their Rest.

Explication propounded, be the Number out of which to substract, 238754207:
And the number to be subtracted 71572604 given Explication required to find
their Rest. Construction: the Number to be subtracted, shall be to placed
under the Number out of which it is to be subtracted, as that the 4 stand
directly under the 7, and the 0 under the 0, and so of the rest, drawing a line
between the numbers given, and another under the number which is to be
subtracted, as hereunder appears. ^ Then beginning at the right hand,
substract 4 from 7, and there rests 3, which shall be set directly under the
4, and then say, 0 out of 0 rests 0, placing 0 under the 0: then 6 from 2,
which being impossible, say, 6 from 10, and 2 (which is 12) rests 6, placing
that under the 6: then 2 from 3, (true it is that you should have said 2 from
4, had it not been that you borrowed 1 from the 4 to make the other 2 to value
12) rests 1, placing that under the 2: and so of all the other. The
disposition of their Characters are as here appears. I say that 167181603 is
the Rest required. Demonstration: adding the Rest 167181603 to the number to be
subtracted 71572604, the sum shall be equal to the number from which the
substraction was made: wherefore seeing that 167181603 is the difference
between the number from which the substraction was made, and the number to be
subtracted; therefore that is their Rest which was to be demonstrated.
Conclusion. An Arithmeticall whole Number from which to be subtracted, and
another to substract, being given, we have found their Rest which was required.

Multiplication of whole Numbers. The third Problem.
AN Arithmeticall whole Number given to be multiplied, and another to multiply,
to find their product. Explication propounded: Be the Multiplicand or Number to
be multiplied 546, and the Multiplicator or number to multiply 37. Explication
required: To find their product, Note, that for the more easy solution of
this proposition, it were necessary to have in memory the multiplication of the
9 simple Characters among themselves, learning them by rote out of the Table
here placed, seeking the Multiplicand in the superior line of squares, and the
Multiplicator in the diagonall or slope line of squares: and in the common
Angle answering them both, you shall find their product. Pythagoras Table.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 3 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 4 16 20 24 29
32 36 5 25 30 35 40 45 6 36 42 48 54 7 49 56 63 8 64 72 9 81

As we would know ye product of 3 and 8, seek 8 in ye upper line, and 3 in the
slope or diagonall: and in the common Angle you shall find 24 their product,
and so of all the rest, as by the Table will plainly appear.

Construction: place the first numbers on the right hand (of the given) one
directly under another, and then draw a line, as heere-under is done. Then say,
7 times 6 make 42, place 2 under the 7, and retain the 4 (because of the 4
tenths) in memory: then say, 7 times 4 make 28, and the 4 which you had in
mind, make 32, whereof place the 2 under the 3, and retain 3, and say, 7
times 5 make 35, and 3 which was borne in mind, make 38, which shall be placed
in order under the line, as you see. ^ In the like sort shall the 546 be
multiplied by the 3 of the multiplicator, saying, 3 times 6 make 18, placing
the 8 under the 3: and so of the rest. Then shall be drawn a line, adding all
that is between ye two lines in this sort.

I say, that 20202 is the Product required.

Demonstration. The 20202 contains the 37 so many times as there is unities
in the 546: therefore 20202 is the product which was to be found. Conclusion.
An Arithmetical whole number being given to be multiplied, and another to
multiply, we have found their required product.

Division of Arithmeticall whole Numbers. The fourth Problem.
AN Arithmeticall whole Number being given to be divided, and another to
divide, to find their Quotient.

Explication propounded: Be the number to be divided, 995, and the number to
divide, 28 given. Explication required: to find their Quotient. Construction:
The number to be divided (or diuident) and the number to divide (or divisor)
shall be placed in order, drawing a crooked line, as hereunder follows,
saying, how many times 2 in 9? three times, (true it is that there are 4 times
2 in 9, and 1 remaining) but we will show ye reason hereafter why we must say
but three times) set down 3 for the first Character of the Quotient, behynd
the crooked line, and the 3 remaining of ye 9 cancelling the 2 and 9: then
multiply 8 by the divisor, by 3, the Quotient it makes 24, which substract
from 39 (here appears the occasion why we said that 2 is but only 3 times in
9: for if we had said 4 times, resting of the 9, and had multiplied 8 by 4 it
would have been 32 which should be subtracted from 19 which then remained of
the diuident, which is impossible; therefore there must be such a number taken,
and placed behind the crooked line, as that the product thereof may be
subtracted from the remaynder) rests 15, which place over 39, cancelling the
39, and the 8, so shall the disposition of the Characters be in this manner. ^
Now to find the second Character of the Quotient, the divisor must again be
set under the diuident, placing the 8 of the divisor under the 5 of the
diuident, and the 2 under the 8, saying how many times 2 in 15? five times,
which 5 shall be placed near the 3 at the oblique line, for the second Character
of the Quotient rests 5 which shall be placed over the 5 of the 15 cancelling
the said 15 and 2: then multiplying the divisor 8 by the Quotie^t 5 makes 40,
which substract from 55 remains 15, cancelling the 55 and the 8 and
distinguishing the 15 with crooked lines from the other Characters: then draw a
line near the Quotient 35, placing over the same the said remaynder, and under
the same the divisor 28, and the disposition of the Characters will be as
appears above, I say that 35 15/28 is the Quotient required.

Demonstration: the 35 15/28 contains the unity so often as the 995
contains the divisor 28: therefore 35 15/28 is the Quotient required which
was to be demonstrated, Conclusion: an Arithmeticall whole number for diuident,
and one for divisor given, we have found their Quotient required.

The Rule of Three, or Golden Rule of Arithmeticall whole Numbers. The fifth
Problem.
THree Terms of Arithmeticall Numbers, being given to find their
proportional Term.

Explication propounded: Be the three terms given 234. Explication required:
To find their fourth proporcionall Term: that is to say, in such Reason to
the third term 4, as the second term 3, is to the first term 2.
Construction: Multiply the second term 3, by the third term 4, yt gives the
product 12: which dividing by the first term 2, gives the Quotient 6: I say
that 6 is the fourth proportional term required. Demonstration: there is from
6 to 4, Reason sesquialter, and the same Reason is there from 3 to 2: therefore
6 is the fourth proportional term to be demonstrated. Conclusion: three
Arithmeticall numbers being given, we have found their fourth proportional
term required.

The Preface of Simon Steuin.
To Astronomers, Land-meaters, Measurers of Tapistry, Gaudgers, Stereometers in
general, Monty-Masters, and to all Merchants, Simon Steuin
wishes health.
MAny seeing the smalnes of this Book, and considering your worthynes to who^
it is dedicated, may perchance esteem this our conceyte absurd: But if the
proportion be considered, the small quantity hereof compared to humane
imbecility, and the great vtility unto high and ingenious intendiments, it will
be found to have made comparison of the extreme terms, which permit not any
conversion of proportion. But what of that? is this an admirable invention? No
certainly: for it is so mean, as that it scant deserves the name of an
invention: for as the cou^tryman by chance sometime finds a great treasure,
without any use of skill or cunning, so has it happened herein. Therefore if any
will think, that I vaunt my self of my knowledge, because of the explication
of these vtilities, out of doubt, he shows himself to have neither
judgment, understanding, nor knowledge to discern simple things from
ingenious inventions, but he (rather) seems envious of the common benefit:
yet howsoever, it were not fit to omit the benefit hereof, for the
inconvenience of such calumny. But as the Mariner having by hap found a
certain unknown Island, spares not to declare to his Prince the riches and
profits thereof; as the fair fruits, precious mineralls, pleasant champions,
etc. and that without imputation of Philautry: even so shall we speak freely
of the great use of this invention; I call it great, being greater then any of
you expect to come from me. Seeing then that the matter of this Disme (the
cause of the name whereof shall be declared by the first difinition following) is
number, the use and effects of which, yourselues shall sufficiently witness by
your continual experiences, therefore it were not necessary to use many words
thereof: for the Astrologer knows, that the world is become by computation
Astronomicall (seeing it teaches the Pilot the elevation of the Equator and of
the Pole, by means of the declination of the Sun, to describe the true
Longitudes, La^titudes, situatio^s and distances of places, etc.) a Paradise,
abou^ding in some places with such things as the Earth cannot bring forth in
other. But as the sweet is never without the sour: so the travail in such
computations cannot be unto him hidden, namely, in the busy multiplications and
divisions which proceed of the 60 progression of degrees, minutes, seconds,
thirds, etc. And the Surueyor or Land-meater knows, what great benefit the
world receives from his science, by which many dissensions and difficulties
are avoided, which otherwise would arise by reason of the unknown capacity of
Land: besides, he is not ignorant (especially whose business and employment is
great) of the troublesome multiplications of Roods, Feet, and oftentimes of
inches, the one by the other, which not only molesteth, but also often (though
he be very well experienced) causes error, tending to the damage of both
parties, as also to the discredit of Land-meater or surueyor, and so for the
Money-masters, Merchants and each one in his business: therefore how much they
are more worthy, and the means to attain them the more laborious, so much the
greater and better is this Disme, taking away those difficulties: But how? it
teaches (to speak in a word) the easy performance of all reckonings,
computations, and accounts, without broken numbers, which can happen in man's
business, in such sort, as that the four Principles of Arithmetic namely,
Addition, Substractio^, Multiplication, and Devisio^, by whole numbers, may
satisfy these effects, affording the like facility unto those that use
Cou^ters. Now if by those means we gain the time which is precious, if
hereby that be saved which otherwise should be lost, if so, the pains,
controversy, error, damage, and other inconveniences commonly happening therein,
be eased, or taken away, then I leave it willingly unto your judgments to be
censured: and for that, that some may say that certain inventions at the first
seem good, which when they come to be practiced, effect nothing of worth, as
it often happens to the serchers of strong moving, which seem good in small
proofs and modells, when in great, or coming to the effect, they are not
worth a Button: whereto we answer, that herein is no such doubt: for
experience daily shows the same: namely, by the practice of diverse expert
Land-meaters of Holland, unto whom we have showed it, who (laying aside that
which each of them had, according to his own manner, invented to lessen their
pains in their computations) do use the same to their great contentment, and
by such fruit as the nature of it witnesses, the due effect necessarily
follows: The like shall also happen to each of your selves using the same as
they do: mean while live in all felicity.

The Argument.
THe Disme has two parts, that is, Definitions and Operations: by ye first
definition is declared what Disme is, by the second, third, and fourth, what
Comencement, Prime, Second etc. and Disme numbers are: the Operation is
declared by four propositions, The Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and
Division of Disme numbers. The order whereof may be successively represented by
this Table.

The Disme has two parts. Definitions, as what is Disme, Comencement, Prime,
Second etc. Disme number. Operations or Practice of the Addition, Substraction,
Multiplication, Division.

And to y^ end the premises may ye better be explaned, there shall be hereunto an
Appendix adjoined, declaring the use of the Disme in many things by certain
examples, and also definitions and operations, to teach such as do not already
know the use and practice of Numeration, and the four principles of common
Arithmetic, in whole numbers, namely, Addition, Substraction, Multiplication,
and Division, together with the Golden Rule, sufficient to instruct the most
ignorant in ye usual practice of this Art of Disme or Decimall Arithmeticke.

The first Part. Of the Definitions of the Dismes.
The first Definition.
DIsme is a kind of Arithmeticke, invented by the tenth progression, consisting
in Characters of Ciphers; whereby a certain number is described, and by which
also all accounts which happen in humane affairs, are dispatched by whole
numbers, without fractions or broken numbers.

Explication.
LEt the certain number be one thousand, one hundred and eleven, described by
the Characters of Ciphers thus 1111, in which it apeareth that each 1 is the
10th part of his precedent character 1: likewise in 2378, each unity of 8 is
the tenth of each unity of 7, and so of all the others: But because it is
convenient that the things whereof we would speak, have names, and that this
manner of computation is found by the consideration of such tenth or disme
progression; that is, that it consists therein entirely, as shall hereafter
appear: We call this Treatise fitly by the name of Disme, whereby all
accounts happening in the affairs of man, may be wrought and effected without
fractions or broken numbers, as hereafter appears.

The second Definition.
EVery number propounded, is called Comencement, wose sign is thus (0).

Explication.
BY example, a certain number is propounded of three hundred sixty four: we
call the 364 Comencements, described thus 364 (0) and so of all other like.

The third Definition.
ANd each tenth part of the unity of the Comencement, we call the Prime, whose
sign is thus (1), and each tenth part of ye unity of the Prime, we call the
Second, whose sign is (2), and so of ye other: each tenth part of the unity of
the precedent sign, always in order, one further.

Explication.
AS 3 (1) 7 (2) 5 (3) 9 (4) that is to say, 3 Primes, 7 Seconds, 5 Thirds, 9
Fourths, and so proceeding infinitely: but to speak of their value, you may
note, that according to this definition, the said numbers are 3/10 7/100 5/1000
9/10000, together 3759/10000 and likewise 8 (0) 9 (1) 3 (2) 7 (3) are worth 8
9/10 3/100 7/1000 together 8 937/1000 and so of other like. Also you may
understand, that in this Disme we use no fractions, and that the multitude of
signs, except (0) never exceed 9: as for example, not 7 (1) 12 (2) but in
their place 8 (1) 2 (2), for they value as much.

The fourth Definition.
THe numbers of the second and third Definitions before going, are generally
called Disme numbers.

The end of the Definitions.
The second part of the Disme. Of the Operation or Practice.
The first proposition of Addition.
DIsme numbers being given how to add them to find their sum.

The explication propounded; there are 3 orders of Disme numbers given, of
which the first 27 (0), 8 (1), 4 (2), 7 (3), the second 37 (0), 8 (1), 7 (2), 5
(3), the third 875 (0), 7 (1) 8 (2), 2 (3). The explication required, we must
find their total sum.

Construction.
The numbers given, must be placed in order as here adjoining, ^ adding them in
the vulgar manner of adding of whole numbers in this manner: The sum (by ye
first Problem of Arithmetic following) is 941504, which are (that which the
signs above the numbers do show) 941 (0) 5 (1) 0 (2) 4 (3). I say, they are
the sum required. Demonstration: the 27 (0) 8 (1) 4 (2) 7 (3) given, make by
the 3 Definition before 27 8/10 4/100 7/1000, together 27 847/1000, and by the
same reason, the 37 (0) 8 (1) 7 (2) 5 (3) shall make 37 875/1000, and the 875
(0) 7 (1) 8 (2) 4 (3) will make 875 782/1000, which three numbers make by
common addition of vulgar Arithmeticke 941 304/1000. But so much is the sum
941 (0) 5 (1) 0 (2) 4 (3): therefore it is the true sum to be demonstrated.
Conclusion: Then Disme numbers being given to be added, we have found their
sum, which is the thing required.

Note, that if in the number given, there want some signs of their natural
order, the place of the defectant shall be filled. As for example, let the
numbers given be 8 (0) 5 (1) 6 (2) and 5 (0) 7 (2): ^ in which, the latter
wanted the sign of (1), in the place thereof shall 0 (1) be put, take then
for that latter number given 5 (0) 0 (1) 7 (2) adding them in this sort.

This advertisement shall also serve in the three following propositions,
wherein the order of the defayling figures must be supplied, as was done in the
former example.

The second Proposition. Of Substraction.
A Disme number being given to substract: another less Disme number given out
of the same to find their rest.

Explication propounded: be the numbers given 237 (0) 5 (1) 7 (2) 8 (3) and 59
(0) 7 (1) 3 (2) 9 (3) The Explication required; to find their rest.

Construction: the numbers given shall be placed in this sort, substracting
according to vulgar manner of substractio^ of whole numbers, thus ^

The rest is 177839 which valueth as the signs over them do denote 177 (0) 8
(1) 3 (2) 9 (3), I affirm ye same to be the rest required.

Demonstration: the 237 (0) 5 (1) 7 (2) 8 (3) make by the third Definition of
this Disme, 237 5/10 7/100 8/1000 together 237, 578/1000 and by the same
reason, the 59 (0) 7 (1) 4 (2) 9 (3) value 59 749/1000 which subtracted from
237 578/1000 there rests 177 839/1000 but so much does 177 (0) 8 (1) 3 (2) 9
(3) value: that is then the true rest which should be made manifest.
Conclusion: a Disme being given, to substract it out of another Disme number,
and to know the rest, which we have found.

The third Proposition: of Multiplication.
A Disme number being given to be multiplied, and a multiplicator given to find
their product:

The Explication propounded: be the number to be multiplied 32 (0) 5 (1) 7 (2),
and the multiplicator 89 (0) 4 (1) 6 (2)

The Explication required: to find the product. Construction: the given numbers
are to be placed as here is showed, ^ multiplying according to the vulgar manner
of multiplication by whole numbers, in this manner, giving ye product, 29137122:
^ Now to know how much they value, join the two last signs together as the
one (2) and the other (2) also, which together make (4), and say yt the last
sign of the product shall be (4) which being known, all the rest are also
known by their continued order. So that the product required, is 2913 (0) 7
(1) 1 (2) 2 (3) 2 (4).

Demonstration: The number given to be multiplied, 32 (0) 5 (1) 7 (2) (as
appears by the third Definition of this Disme) 32 5/10 7/100 together 32
57/100: and by the same reason the multiplicator 89 (0) 4 (1) 6 (2) value 89
46/100 by the same, the said 32 57/100 multiplied, gives the product 2913,
7122/10000 But it valueth 2913 (0) 7 (1) 1 (2) 2 (3) 2 (4). It is then the true
product which we were to demonstrate. But to show why (2) multiplied by (2)
gives the product (4) which is the sum of their numbers, also why (4) by (5)
produces (9), and why (0) by (3) produces (3) etc. Let us take 2/10 and 3/100
which (by the third Definition of this Disme) are 2 (1) 3 (2) their product is
6/10000 which value by the said third Definition 6 (3), multiplying then (1) by
(2) the product is (3) namely a sign compounded of the sum of the numbers of
the signs given.

Conclusion.
A Disme number to multiply, and to be multiplied, being given, we have found
the product, as we ought.

Note.
IF the latter sign of the number to be multiplied, be unequal to the
latter sign of the multiplicator, as for example, the one 3 (4) 7 (5) 8 (6),
the other 5 (1) 4 (2), they shall he handled as aforesaid, and the disposition
thereof shall be thus. ^

The fourth Proposition: of Division.
A Disme number for the diuident, and divisor, being given to find the Quotient.

Explication proposed: let the number for the diuident be 3 (0) 4 (1) 4 (2) 3
(3) 5 (4) 2 (5) and the divisor 9 (1) 6 (2). Explication required: to find
their Quotient.

COnstruction: the numbers given divided (omitting the signs) according to the
vulgar manner of dividing of whole numbers, gives the Quotient, 3587; now to
know what they value; the latter sign of the divisor (2) must be subtracted
from the latter sign of the diuident which is (5), rests (3) for the latter
sign of the latter Character of ye Quotient, which being so known, all ye
rest are also manifest by their continued order, thus 3 (0) 5 (1) 8 (2) 7 (3)
are the Quotient required.

DEmonstration: the number diuident given 3 (0) 4 (1) 4 (2) 3 (3) 5 (4) 2 (5)
makes (by the third Definition of this Disme) 3 4/10 4/100 3/1000 5/10000
2/100000 together 3 44352/100000 and by ye same reason, the divisor 9 (1) 6 (2)
valueth 96/100, by which 3 44352/100000 being divided, gives the Quotient 3
587/1000; but the said Quotient valueth 3 (0) 5 (1) 8 (2) 7 (3): therefore it
is the true Quotient to be demonstrated.

Conclusion: a Disme number being given for the diuident and divisor, we have
found the Quotient required.

Note, if the diuisors signs be higher then the signs of the diuident, there
may be as many such Ciphers 0 joined to the diuident as you will, or many as
shall be necessary: as for example, ^ 7 (2) are to be divided by 4 (5), I place
after the 7 certain 0 thus 7000, dividing them as aforesaid, and in this sort
it gives for the Quotient 1750 (7).

It happens also sometimes, that the Quotient cannot be expressed by whole
numbers, as 4 (1) divided by 3 (2) in this sort, ^ whereby appears, that
there will infinitely come from the 3 the rest of and in such an accident you
may come so near as the thing requires, omitting the remaynder, it is true,
that 13 (0) 3 (1) 3 (2) etc. shall be the perfect Quotient required: but our
intention in this Disme is to work all by whole numbers: for seeing that in any
affairs, men reckon not of the thousandth part of a mile, grain, etc. as the
like is also used of the principal Geometricians, and Astronomers, in
co^putacions of great consequence, as Ptolome and Johannes Monta-regio have not
described their Tables of Arches, Chords, or Sines, in extreme perfection (as
possibly they might have done by Multinomall numbers,) because that
imperfection (considering the scope and end of those Tables) is more convenient
then such perfection.

Note 2. the extraction of all kinds of Roots may also be made by these Disme
numbers: as for example, To extract the square root of 5 (2) 2 (3) 9 (4),
which is performed in the vulgar manner of extraction in this sort, ^ and the
root shall be 2 (1) 3 (2), for the moitye or half of the latter sign of the
numbers given, is always the latter sign of the root: wherefore if the
latter sign given were of a number imper: the sign of the next following
shall be added, and then it shall be a number per; and then extract the Root as
before. Likewise in the extraction of the Cubique Root, the third part of the
latter sign given shall be always the sign of the Root: and so of all other
kind of Roots.

The end of the Disme.
The Appendix.
The Preface.
Seeing that we have already described the Disme, we will now come to the use
thereof, showing by vi. Articles, how all computations which can happen in any
man's business, may be easily performed thereby: beginning first to show how they
are to be put in practice, in the casting up of the content or quantity of Land
measured as follows.

The first Article, of the Computations of Land-meating.
CAll the Perch or Rood also Comencement, which is 1 (0), dividing that into
10 equal parts, whereof each one shall be 1 (1); the^ divide each prime again
into 10 equal parts, each of which shall be 1 (2); and again each of them into
10 equal parts, and each of them shall be 1 (3); proceeding further so, if need
be; but in Land-meating, divisions of second will be small enough: yet for such
things as require more exactnes, as Fathom of the Lead, Bodies etc. there may
be thirds used: and for as much as the greater number of Land-meaters use not
the Pole, but a chain line of three, four or five Perch long marking upon the
yard of their cross staff certain feet 5 or 6 with fingers, palms etc. the
like may be done here: for in the place of their five or six feet with their
fingers, they may put 5 or 6 primes with their seconds.

THis being so prepared, these shall be used in measuring, without regarding the
feet and fingers of the Pole, according to the Custom of the place: and that
which must be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided according to this
measure, shall be performed according to the doctrine of the precedent examples.

AS for example, we are to add 4. tryangles or surfaces of Land, whereof the
first 345 (0) 7 (1) 2 (2), ye second 872 (0) 5 (1) 3 (2), the third 615 (0) 4
(1) 8 (2) ye fourth 956 (0) 8 (1) 6 (2); ^

THese being added according to the manner declared in the first Proposition of
this Disme in this sort, their sum will be 2790 (0) or Perches 5 (1) 9 (2),
the said Roods or Perches, divided according to the custom of the place; (for
every Acre contains certain Perches) by the number of perches you shall have
the Acres sought. But if one would know how many feet and fingers are in the 5
(1) 9 (2) (that which Land-meater shall need to do but once, and that at the
end of the casting up of the proprietaries, although most men esteem it
unnecessary to make any mention of feet and fingers) it will appear upon the
Pole how many feet and fingers (which are marked, joining the tenth part upon
another side of the Rood) accord with themselves.

In the second, out of 57 (0) 3 (1) 2 (2) subtracted 32 (0) 5 (1) 7 (2) it may
be effected according to the second proposition of this Disme, in this manner: ^

In the third (for multiplication of the sides of certain Triangles and
Quadrangles) multiply 8 (0) 7 (1) 3 (2), by 7 (0) 5 (1) 4 (2) 2 this may be
performed according to the third proposition of this Disme, in this manner: ^

And gives for the product or superfices 65 (0) 8 (1) etc.

In the fourth let A, B, C, D, be a certain Quadrangle Rectangular (from which
we must cut 367 (0) 6 (1) and the side A D: makes 26 (0) 3 (1): The question
is, how much we shall measure from A, toward B, to cut off, (I mean by a line
parallel to A D,) the said 367 (0) 3 (1)

Divide 367 (0) 6 (1) by 26 (0) 3 (1) according to the fourth proposition of
this Disme: so the Quotient gives from A, toward B, 13 (0) 9 (1) 7 (2), which
is A E.

And if we will, we may come nearer (although it be needles) by the second
note of the fourth Proposition, the demonstrations of all these examples are
already made in their propositions. ^

The II. Article: of the Computations of the measures of Tapistry, or Cloth.
THe Ell of the Measurer of Tapistrie or cloth, shall be to him 1 (0), the
which he shall divide (upon the side whereon the partitions, which are
according to the ordinance of ye Town, is not set out) as is done above on ye
Pole of ye Land meater, namely into 10 equal parts, whereof each shall be 1
(0), then each 1 (1) into 10 equal parts, of which each shall be 1 (2) etc.
And for the practice seeing that these examples do altogether accord with
those of the first Article of Landmeating, it is thereby sufficiently manifest,
so as we need not here make any mention again of them.

The III. Article: of the Computations, serving to Gaudging, and the measures
of all Liquor vessels.
ONe Ame (which makes 100 pots Antwerp) shall be 1 (0), the same shall be
divided in length and deepnes, into 10 equal parts (namely, equal to respect
of the wine, not of the Rod; of which the parts of the pro^ditie shall be
unequal) and each part shall be 1 (1) containing 10 pots, then again each 1 (1)
into 10, parts equal as before, and each will make 1 (2) worth 1 pot, then each
1 (2) into 10. equal parts making each 1 (3).

Now the Ro^ being so divided, to know the content of the Tun, multiply and
work as in the precedent first Article, of which (being sufficiently manifest)
we will not speak here any farther.

But seeing that this tenth division of the deepnes is not vulgar, we will
explain the same. Let the rod be one Ame. A. B. which is 1 (0) divided
(according to the custom) into the points of the deepnes of these nine: C, D,
E, F, G, H, I, K, A, making each part 1 (1) which shall be again each part
divided into 10. thus. Let each 1 (1) be divided into two so: draw the line, B
M. with a right angle upon A B. and equal to 1 (1), B C, then (by the 13
proposition of Euclid his 6: book) find the mean proportional between B M
and his moytie, which is B N: cutting B O: equal to B N: And if N O: be
equal to B C: the operation is good. Then note the length N C: from B toward
A, as B P: the which being equal to N C: the operation is good: likewise the
length of B N: from B to Q: and so of the rest.

It remains yet to divide each length as B O and O C, etc. into five, thus:
Seek the mean proportional between B M: and his 10 part which shall be B R:
cutting B S: equal to B R: Then the length S R. noted from B toward A: as B T:
and likewise the length T R: from B to V: and so of the others: and in like
sort proceeding to divide B S: and S T: etc. into (3), I say that B S: S T: and
T V: etc. are the desired (2) which is thus to be demonstrated.

For that B N: is the mean proportional line (by the Hipothesis between B M:
and his moytie, the square of B N: (by the 17. proposition of the sixth book of
Euclide) shall be equal to the Rectangle of B M: and his moytie: But the same
Rectangle is the moytie of ye square of B M: the square then of B N: is equal
to the moytie of the square of B M: But B O is (by Hipothesis) equal to B N:
and B C: to B M: the square then of B O: is equal to the moitie of the square
of B C. And in like sort it is to be demonstrated, that the square of B S is
equal to the tenth part of the square of B M. Wherefore etc. we have made the
demonstration brief, because we write not this to learners, but unto masters
in their science.

The IIII. Article: of Computations of Stereometrie in general.
TRue it is, that Gaudgerie which we have before declared, is Stereometrie (yt
is to say, the Art of measuring of bodies) but considering the diverse divisions
of the Rod, Yard, or Measure of the one and other, and that and this do so
much differ, as the Genus and the Species: they ought by good reason to be
distinguished. For all Stereometrie is not Gaudgerie. To come to the point, the
Stereometrian shall use the measure of the town or place, as the Yard, Ell
etc. with his ten partitions, as is described in the first and second
Articles, the use and practice thereof, (as is before showed) is thus: Put case
we have a Quadrangular, Rectangular Column to be measured, the length
whereof is 3 (1) 2 (2), the breadth 2 (1) 4 (2), the height 2 (0) 3 (1) 5 (2),
The question is, how much the substance or matter of that Pillar is: Multiply
(according to the doctrine of the 4. proposition of this Disme) the length by
the breadth, and the product again by the height in this manner, ^

And the product appears to be 1 (1) 8 (2) 4 (4) 8 (5).

NOte, some ignorant (and understanding not that we speak here) of the
Principles of Stereometry, may maruayle wherefore it is said, that the greatness
of ye abouesaid colu^n is but 1 (1) etc. seeing that it co^tayneth more then 180
cubes, of which the length of each side is 1 (1), he must know that the body of
one yard is not a body of 10 (1) as a yard in length, but 1000 (1) in respect
whereof 1 (1) makes 100 Cubes, each of 1 (1) as the like is sufficiently
manifest amongst Land-meats in surfaces: for when they say 2 Roodes, 3 Feet of
Land, it is not barelymeant 2 square Roods, and three square feet, but two
Roods (and counting but 12 feet to the Rood) 36 feet square: therefore if the
said Question had been how many Cubes each being 1 (1) was in the greatness of
the said Pillar, the solution should have been fitted accordingly, considering
that each of these 1 (1) does make 100 (1) of those; and each 1 (2) of these
makes 10 (1) of those etc. or otherwise, if the tenth part of the yard be the
greatest measure that the Stereometrian proposes, he may call it 1 (0), and so
as abouesayd.

The fifth Article; of Astronomicall Computations.
THe ancient Astronomers having divided their Circles each into 360 degrees,
they saw, that the Astronomicall Computations of them with their parts was too
laborious: and therefore they divided also each degree into certain parts, and
those again into as many, etc. to the end thereby to work always by whole
numbers, choosing the 60th progression, because that 60 is a number measurable
by many whole measures, namely, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 10, 12, 15, 20, 30: but if
experience may be credited (we say with reverence to the venerable antiquity,
and moved with the common vtility) the 60th progression was not the most
convenient, (at least) amongst those that in nature consist potentially, but
the tenth which is thus: we call the 360 degrees also Comencements, expressing
them so 360 (0), and each of them a degree 12 1 (0) to be divided into 10
equal parts, of which each shall make 1 (1), and again each 1 (1) into 10 (2)
and so of the rest, as the like has already been often done.

Now this division being understood, we may describe more easily that we
promised in Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, and Division; but because
there is no difference between the operation of these, and the four former
propositions of this book, it would but be loss of time, and therefore they
shall serve for examples of this Article: yet adding thus much, that we will
use this manner of partition in all the Tables and computations which happen in
Astronomy, such as we keep to diuulge in our vulgar Germane Language, which to
the most rich adorned and perfect Tongue of all other, and of the most
singularity, of which we attend a more abundant demonstration, then Peter and
John have made thereof in the Bewysconst and Dialectique, lately diuulged, and
have in the lease following placed a necessary Table, for the reducing of the
minutes, seconds, etc. of the 60, progression, into primes, seconds, etc. of
the tenth progression: the use whereof follows.

The use of this Table.
When any number of minutes, seconds, thirds, fourths etc. of the 60th
progressio^, are given to be reduced into the primes, seconds, thirds, etc. of
the tenth progression, seek the given number in this Table, or if the number
be not there to be found, take the nearest: if none be there great enough, take
half or one quarter of the given: if there be none small enough, double,
treble, or quadruple, the given, and then as aforesaid seek the nearest number
thereunto in the Table, and the two numbers in whose common Angle the given
number is found, or nearest found, shall show you the quantity and quality of
the subdiuisions of the ten progressions proper to that given number, namely,
the number standing in the top or front of the table directly over it, shall
show the quantity, and the number directly against it in the first Column
toward the left hand, shall denote the quality; as for example, be the
pronumber given ^, seek it in the Table, and you shall find to stand in the
front directly over it the figure 7, and in ye first Column directly against
it toward the left hand (5): therefore according to the rule above mentioned, I
conclude, that ^ of the 60 progression valueth just 7 (5) of the tenth
progression etc. This example I think sufficient to enlighten the ingenious
practizer: only this, that if there be no number to be found in the Table,
just or near the number given, you may take two, three or more of those that
will come nearest, and so work as before: as for example also, be the number
given ^ of the 60 progression; you shall find them all by taking 4 of the
numbers of ye colu^ne under 3, to be ^ of the tenth progression: and so with a
small diligence may any other number of the one progression be reduced into the
other, which I omit to speak any further of at this time.

The sixth Article; of the Computations of Money-masters, Merchants, and of all
estates in general.
TO the end we speak in general and briefly of the su^me and contents of this
Article, it must be always understood, yt all measures (be they of length,
liquors, of money etc.) be parted by the tenth progression, and each notable
species of them, shall be called Comencement: as a Mark, comencement of weight,
by the which Silver and Gold are wayed, Pound of other common weights,
Liuers-degros in Flanders, Pound sterling in England, Ducat in Spain etc.
Comencement of Money: the highest sign of the Mark shall be (4), for 1 (4)
shall weigh about the half of one Es of Antwerp, the (3) shall serve for the
highest sign of the Liver de gros, seeing that 1 (3) makes less then the
quarter of one DS.

The subdiuisions of weight to weigh al things, shall be (in place of the half
pound, quarter, half quarter, ounce, half ounce, esterlin, grain, Es, etc.
of each sign, 5, 3, 2, 1, that is to say, that after the pound or 1 (0) shall
follow the half pound or 5 (1), then the 3 (1) then the 2 (1) then the 1 (1),
and the like subdiuisions have also the 1 (1) and the other following.

WE think it necessary, that each subdiuision, what matter soever the subject
be of, be called Prime, Second, Third, etc. and that because it is notable unto
us, yt the Second, being multiplied by the Third, gives in ye product the
Fifth (because two and three make five, as is said before) also the Third
divided by the Second, gives ye Quotient Prime etc. that which so properly
cannot be done by any other names: but when it shall be named for distinction of
the matters (as to say, half an Ell, half a pound, half a pynte etc.) we may
call them Prime of Marc, Second of Marc, Second of Pound, Second of Ell, etc.

But to the'nd we may give example, suppose 1 Mark of Gold value 36 lib. 5 (1)
3 (2) the Question what valueth 8 Marks 3 (1) 5 (2) 4 (3): multiply 3653 by
8354 giving the product by the fourth Proposition (which is also the solution
required) 395 lib. 1 (1) 7 (2) 1 (3); as for the 6 (4) and 2 (5) they are here
of no estimation.

SVppose again, yt 2 Else and 3 (1) cost 3 lib. 2 (1) 5 (2) ye question is,
what shall 7 Else 5 (1) 3 (2) cost: multiply according to the custom the last
term given by the second, and divide the product by the first, that is to say,
753 by 325 makes 244725, which divided by 23, gives the Quotient and Solution
10 lib. 6 (1) 4 (2).

WE could also more amply demonstrate by easy examples of broken numbers, ye
comparison and great difference of the facility of this more then that, but we
will pass them over for breuity sake.

LAstly, it may be said, that there is some difference between this last sixth
Article, and the 5 precedent Articles, which is, that each one may exercise for
them selves the tenth partition of the said precedent 5 Articles, thoughst be
not given by the Magistrate of the place as a general order, but it is not so
in this latter: for the examples hereof, are vulgar computations, which do
almost continually happen to every man, to whom it were necessary that the
solution so found, were of each accepted for good and lawful: Therefore
considering the so great use, it would be a commendable thing, if some of those
who expect the greatest commodity, would solicit to put ye same in execution to
effect, namely, that joining the vulgar partitions that are now in weight,
measures, and moneys (continuing still each Capital measure, weight and Coin
in all places vnaltred) that the same tenth progression might be lawfully
ordained by the superiors, for every one that would use the same it might also
do well, if the values of Moneys, principally the new Coins, might be valued
and reckned upon certain Primes, Seconds, Thirds etc But if all this be not
put in practice so soon as we could wish, yet it will first content us, yt it
will be beneficial to our successors, if future men shall hereafter be of such
nature as our predecessors, who were never negligent of so great advantage.
Secondly, that it is not unnecessary for each in particular, for so much as
concerns him, for that they may all deliver them selves when they will, from
so much and so great labor. And lastly, although the effects of the sixth
Article appear not immediately, yet it may be; and in the mean time may each
one exercise himself in the five precedent, such as shall be most convenient for
them; as some of them have already practiced.

The end of the Appendix.
