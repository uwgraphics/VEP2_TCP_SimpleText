And first it puts a prayer to move the mind of man to laud god.
Capitulu^.i.
Lord my god I desire to laud the / for I know myself to be made to laud
ye. Open my mouth in thy laud yt I may sing Joy to thy name. Stere my heart
in the / put away every tedyous thing / infunde grace / kendle love / take
away wickedness of thy servant / cleanse me from all uncleaness of body and
soul that I may be found worthy unto the honor of thy name / and thereto open
my lyppes. But the dygnyte of thy deep majesty who may praise worthily /
behold all the virtues of heuens / and every aungelyke potestate suffyseth not
to laud / condyngly y^ magnytude of thy highness. How much less a frail
man fylth and worms mete fails in thy condy^ge laud. And so does also
every creature / every oryson / every tongue / and sermocynacyon / what now
therefore. I shall cease fro laud / for I can not worthily laud the / or else
therefore I shall cease and hold me still / for I know myself unclean and
vnsuffycyent / Be it forbode such ingratitude yt I should cease to laud the /
for every creature should laud the / most of all truly resonableman to whom
y^ have given so great benefytes.

Laud to the holy Trynyte for himself / and for the creacyon of heaven and
earth / of angel and man / and for his benefytes. Capitulum.ii.
O Blessed lord god / fader / sone / and holy ghost / three persons and one
god / my lord / my god / my maker / my redemptour my nouryssher / my defender
/ my swetnesse / my mercy / my refuge / my strength / my victory / my savior /
my Joy / and my glory eternal. I laud the. I gloryfye the. I honor and
worship the. O blessed trinite for that thou art in thy self / for you art
the highest good / from whom flows all goodness / thou art gracyous
eternyte / thou art eternal felicite / thou art the depnesse of felicite /
thou art only god / and there is none without the. I laud and honor the. O
blessed trinite that myghtfully have made of naught heaven and earth / son and
moan and all things that be in them / and for it pleased the to make holy
aungelles to laud and to use the eternally / and that they might assyst to us
faithfully in this exile with houeable coun^eyles and helpynges / and to
declare thy ineffable goodness thou made al thing for man / and more over
thou made man with thy propre hands to thyn own image and symylytude only for
the / and thou fourmed in him vnderstandy^ge / and noblysshed him with free
will. I laud and gloryfye the* for that great gift thou set him in paradyse /
flowy^ge with delytes that he might have high things in fruycyon / inferyour
things in gouernynge / and to possede all things to worship the for evermore.
And thou made not these noble creatures angel and man for any necessyte that
thou had to them / for truly all thing was sufficyent in the to thyn eternal
Joy and glory / but of the feruor of thy charity thou were moved to create
them that such creatures should be part takers of thyn ineffable Joy and
glory I laud and honor the good lord for that it pleased y^ among all thy
blessed works to make me a reasonable man / and have given me wisdom / reason
/ understanding / and free lyberte / and have fourmed me with all right lymmes
and fetures of body / and have given me many blessed gifts / spyrytuall and
temporal / and also mete / drink / cloth / and all things necessary which
many a good creature that has served the better than I have done has myssed /
and for that thou have visit my heart many times with many graces and spyrytuall
monycyons delyuerynge me often fro many perils both of body and of soul /
and fro sclaundres / shames / and rebukes of this world to the which for my
sins I might have fall unto / and for that also that thou have suffered me in
all mine iniquyte / malice / and all mine horrible and abhomynable sins /
pacyently always abiding for my conuersyon and amendment / when innumerable
times you might have slain me / and of right have put me to eternal pains and
dampnacyon. I laud and gloryfy the lord god for all thy mercy which always
you have showed to sinners / pacyently abiding for them / mercyfully cally^ge
them / benygnely receyuynge them / haboundauntly gyuynge grace to them / and to
such famylyaryte admyt tynge them / as though they had never sinned. O mercy
full lord and pacyent god what shall I say to the for all these benefytes /
what lauds and thankynges shall I yield to the / what and all my sins were
voyded fro me truly yet were not I worthy for ye leest of thy benefytes and
mercyes to give the condynge laud / but as a wreched sinner can in all my
heart I laud the. I thank the. I honor and worship the / and all honor and
laud be yield to the now and evermore. Amen. Pater noster.

Of the miserable laps of man and of the mercy of god showed to him / and of
the incarnacyon of christ. Ca.iii.
I Laud and gloryfy the lord god for thy most excellent mercy and indycyble
mysericorde / by the which thou did spare man from irreparable dampnacyon /
trespassynge to the / being unworthy to all thy benefytes / sendynge him out
fro the gladness of paradyse to do penance for his sins And all be it he
was worthy eternal dampnacyon for his tra^sgressyon / and should not have
forgyuenesse / thou did not show than the rygoure of Justice / but the
swetnesse of ineffable mercy / putting to him the burden of dynge penance /
and after long time gyuynge the oil of indulgence which greatly he desired. I
laud and gloryfy the lord god creator and redemptour of mankind for thy
great charity by the which man meruaylously create / more meruaylously thou
would him refourme / and where as than we being thyn enemies / and wicked death
had taken lordshyp over us al. Thou have remembered the bowelles of thy mercy
and thou have behold from the high habytacyon of thy glory unto this weeping
valey of mysery / and have seen thafflyccyon of thy people to be great upon the
earth / the grievous burden of the children of Adam. Therefore thou were touched
withinforth with the swetnesse of charity and thou did put in thyselfe to
think on us with cogitacyons of peace and redempcyon / for why when that the
fullness of time was come / thou came to vysyte us shynynge from above. And the
desires of prophets by the exhybycyon of incarnacyon taken thou dydest fulfill
it in apperynge god and man. Blessed be thou therefore O holy fader of heaven yt
would not spare thyn only beloved sone eternal god with the to send him
down to this miserable world to take flesh and blood of a virgyn to redeem
man. Blessed be thou o holy ghoost for yt thou gave counseyle of the
incarnacyon of the sone of god / and of the redempcyon of mankind / and wrough
test the mystery of the incarnacyon of you said sone of god in the body of a
virgyn. Blessed be all the holy trinyte in whom was one counseyle / one will /
one charity / and one operacyon in the high mystery of man's redempcyon all be
it the second person in deite only took our said humanite on him / wherefore
o sweet sone of god blessed be thou that of great pity / compassyon / and of
excellent charity enclyned thy self so benygnely to descend from the trone of
god / and from the heart of the fader to this valey of mysery for us to be
incarnate and to take flesh and blood of the sweet virgyn mary the holy
ghoost gaderynge together the clean and pure drops of blood of her virgynall
body / fourmynge therewith the precious body of thyn humanyte / fulfylly^ge the
holy soul and blessed body of the said virgyn mary superhaboundau^tly with
incomparable gladness and exultacyon in the time of thy holy and clean
concepcyon / and likewise in thy pure and chaste temporal natiuite.
Paternoster. Aue.

Of the virtue and holy life of the virgyn mary / by the which she deserved to
be the mother of god / and of the natyuyte of our lord. Capitulum.iiii.
O Blessed vyrgyn Mary / thou art blessed / and ever be thou blessed for that
you pleased god most hyghly by most holy and virtuous living Li. P^ino
reuelationu^ beat Brigitte. ca. x. A.
/for anon at thy beginning in thy tender aege when thou her de say and
understood that there was god / anon thou were full besy and ferefull in
obseruacyon and keeping of the health of thy soul / and when you herdest fully
that the same god was thy maker and Judge of all thy works / inwardly thou
loved him / and dradde gretely in thy mind leest thou should offend him in
word or deed / and after that when thou herdest that he had given law and
precepts to the people / and that he had showed many meruayles to them you
purposed steadfastly in thy mind to love no thing but him / and than all
worldly things were wonderful bitter to the / and after this herynge that the
same god would redeem the world / and would be borne of a virgyn / Ibidem
such charity had thou to him in thy heart yt thou thoughtest no thing
but god / and thou wylled no thing but god / and as much as thou might thou
withdrewest thy self fro the presence and speech of thy parents and friends /
Ibidem
and thou gave of thy goods as much as thou might to the poor and nedy
people / reserving of them full little to thyselfe to find the in scarcete
mete / drink / and cloth / no thing pleased the but only god / Ibidem
thou wylled ever in thy heart to live to ye time of his natiuite / if it might
so happen you might be made an unworthy handmayde to the mother of god. I laud
and honor the. O mary virgyn of virgyns that have not seen before ye none like
to the / ne to have any such following after the / yt first of all in the
world among women have vowed y^ vow of chastyte and offered thereby a glorious
gift to god / when thou had it of no creature by learning / ne by word ne by
example / thou were not taught to do so / and thou so ornate and beawtyfyed
with that virtue of chastyte and with all other virtues you pleased god most
hyghly gyuy^ge example of good lyuy^ge to all other. Ibide^ B.
And wha^ the time came in which after the consuetude virgyns were presented
in to ye temple / thou were there among them for the obedyens of thy parents
/ thy^kynge in thy self that no thing was impossyble to god. And for as much
as he knew that thou desired no thing ne wylled no thing but only him / he
might keep the in virgynyte if it pleased him / if not his will to be fulfilled
And herynge all thing commanded in the temple obedyently fulfylly^ge it thou
returned home again. And after that holy virgin thou brenned more fervently
and fully in the sweet love of god than thou did before / and daily thou were
inflambed with new ardour and high desires of love / Ibide^
and therefore good lady thou enlonged thy self more than thou were wont to do
fro the company of all people and were alone by thyselfe both day and night
dredynge gretely leest thy mouth should speak / or eeres should here any thing
against the will of thy god / or ye thyn eyes should se any delectable thing.
Thou were dredefull also in kepy^ge silence leest thou should be still not
speaking such words which thou should speak / and so sweet virgyn thou were
often troubled in mind and ferefull how thou should order thy wits and
living to the pleasure of god. And after when by the au^gelyke salutacyon thou
were plenarely instruct yt thou should conceive a sone in thy womb by the
operacyon of the holy ghoost / whose name should be Ihesus / and should be
called ye sone of god / than therewith thou had a most fervent desire to be the
mother of god / but all be it thou knew thyselfe elect thereto of god / yet you
were not therefore in mind exalted by elacyon / but of the fullness of
profounde humylyte consenting unto that so high a mystery / thou brake out
words of this manner mekely saying. Lo here the handmayde of god / befall it
to me angel after thy word. And this said forthwith gods sone was
incarnate in thy virgynall body of the holy ghost. I laud and gloryfy the O
good lady mary clean and pure virgyn that broughtest forth in to this world by
most clean and chaste natiuite ye redemptour of the world / and showed to the
world his savior of long time desired in the world / and in his birth thou
bare him without sorrow and sin / in likewise as thou conceived him in all
cle^nes with such exultacyon of soul and body / that for thaboundaunce of
Joy and exultacyon thy holy fete felt not the ground that they stood on. Li.
x. reuelat. bt^ brigitte. ca. x. D.
And when thy sweet sone our lord Ihesu christ bryghtnesse of the faders glory
was borne thou lapped him in poor clothes reclynynge hy^ in a rack / for
there was none other place whereupon to lay him. And so the king of glory
would be borne poorly / in a poor place / and of a poor virgyn / laid on hey
between two beestes for to bring us to the eternal richesse of heaven And
after his birth good lady when thou beheld his pulcritude and beawte thy holy
soul dystylled as a sweet dew for Joy / Ibidem.
thinking thyselfe unworthy to have such a sone / Li. vi. reuela. ca. p^mo.
for sothely he was so fair and delectable that who so ever beheld him he was
conforted of any sorrow that was in heart. Therefore many of the Jews said. Go
we to se the sone of Mary that we may find thereby consolacyon. Ibidem
And al be it they knew not that he was the sone of god / yet they received by
the sight of him great and meruaylous co^solacyon. Li. x. reuela. ca. x. D.
And good lady when thou beheld and considered the places in his fair hands
and pretty fete where the sharp nails should perce through / as thou had herd
by holy prophets / thy blessed eyes were replete with teres of weeping / and
thy virgynall heart was as cloven asonder for sorrow. And when thy little sweet
sone beheld thy eyes full of weeping / he was sorrowful as unto the death for
the. And when thou co^sydered the might of his deite thou were than conforted /
knowing well yt thy sone would have it so / and that it was expedyent. Ibidem
And than thou co^fourmed all thy will to his will / and so ever good lady thy
Joy was myxte with sorrow. Blessed be thou virgyn Mary mother of god for that
thou nourysshed thy sweet sone our lord with ye sweet heavenly tode of thy
pappes bathing him / byndynge him in swadles / enbrasynge him thy little sweet
flower in thyn arms and virginal bosom / impressynge oftentimes to his fair
mouth sweet kysses of thy delycate mouth. And when you did se him suffrynge
the greuaunce of a young child and weeping / thou losed his bands layenge thy
fair hands and holy arms over his crybbe / playenge with hy^ smiling on him
/ speaking fair words to him / and casting the fair lokes of thy virgynall
eyes on him. Pater noster. Aue maria.

Of ye dolorous circumcision of our lord Ihesu. Ca. v.
THankynges I yield to the lord Ihesu christ for that it pleased the obeyenge
to ye laws the viii. day to be circumcised and anon in thy tender infancy to
be kytte in thy tender flesh with a knyfe of stone and than to begin to shed
thyn innocent blood for us / and to be ensigned with the sweet name Jesus named
fro the beginning by the mouth of god / and showed by the angel / which by
interpretacyon is to say a savior / and after the effect of the same name
thou decreued to save us thy people peculyer from our sins. And from thens
forth thou never left to work our health. Oration.
Sweet Ihesu I beseech the for the grievous pain that you suffered than in thy
tender flesh and for thy bitter weeping to circu^cyse me from every spotte of
sin / and grant me such grace that in a most sweet memory of love thy
holy name Jesus may be enprynted in my heart. Pater noster. Aue maria.

Of the oblacyon of the three holy kings unto our lord Ihesu. Capitulum.vi.
Laud and honor be to the lord Jesus that sode syrably would be sought of
three kings / and so to be found of them by ledynge of a sterre / and of them
humbly to be honored / wha^ most devoutly they offered to the three precious
gifts / gold / encens / and myrre / having in them dyuyne mysteryes. The
gold signifienge thy regal power. The encens thy dyuyne majesty. And the myrre
of thy man-hode the mortalyte. Oration.
Benygne Jesus I pray y^ to send me grace spyrytually to offer these gifts to
the. The pure gold of perfect love. The sweet encens of devout prayer. And
the clean myrre of mortyfycacyon of my frail flesh. Pater noster. Aue maria.

Of the presentacyon of our lord in to the temple / and of the puryfycacyon of
our lady. Capitulum.vii.
THankynges I yield to the lord jesus christ that in every thing would
^ubmytte thyselfe unto the ^nstytucyons of the law / and in the arms of thy
mother mekely would be borne with oblacyons of poor men. And so thou lord of
the temple would be presented in to ye temple / and under the substance of
our frail flesh offered thyselfe to god the fader a wholesome sacryfyce for us
/ and made the secretenesse of thy godhede to be showed by the old man
Symeon by inspiracyon of the holy ghoost dwelling in him. I gloryfye the clean
virgyn Mary that in like wise would humbly submytte thyselfe to the law of
puryfycacyon when thou were no thing bound thereto for only unto this law
all the women were bound that conceived a child by the sede of man. Leuiti.
xii.
But thou O clean vyrgyn conceived not thy blessed sone by the sede of man /
but by inspyracyon of the holy ghost. And so good lady thou were all clean /
chaste / and bright / wherefore thou had no manner necessyte of puryfycacyon /
but of profounde humylyte. Bernardus
O clean virgyn thou would be in this world among women by purifycacyon as
one of them. And so was thy sweet sone among children by circu^cysyon as one
of them. Than seen thou meke lady would be puryfyed that had no need of
puryfycacyon how much cause than have we great sinners to be puryfyed and
cleansed that be so defiled and cankered with sin. Oration.
Therefore make us good lady so to be puryfyed and cleansed here in this world
from every sport of lynne that after this life in all clennesse we may appear
before the glorious face of thy blessed sone Amen. Pater noster. Aue maria.

Of the persecucyon of Ihesu / and of his fleing in to Egypt / and of the
holy Innocents slain of Herod. Capitulum.viii.
THankynges I yield to ye lord Ihesu christ / sapyence of the fader / and
virtue of the high god that would so perfytly take all our infyrmytees /
debylytees / and offenses on the / exceptynge ygnoraunce and sin / so that
thou would flee death and a mortal man fro place to place / for Herod
gylefully sought the and found the not / wherefore he commanded to slay all
the children in bethleem from two year aege and within that he might slay the
among them. But thou the hope of pilgrims went in to egypt / and there thou
dwelled in exyle unto the death of Herod / and did suffer there great penury
and pouerte / for they that should be thyn would not receive the / but anon at
thy beginning despised the. And after the death of Herod thou were called
again from Egypt in to Nazareth. And when thou were thither brought thou were
humbly subgecte to thy parents. Pater noster. Aue maria.

in the temple in the mids of doctors asking and herynge them / and thou
taught them so much ye more when thou asked them questyons prudently. And
there thou raddest thyn own prophecy in ysay. And thou blessed sone of god
began to grow in aege and wisdom as god and man. And.xxxiii. years thou were
as a servant so suffrynge for our health / and thou were conuersaunt among
men / mekely / Justly / sobrely / and pacyently to give us example of living.
Oration.
I pray the good Ihesu for all ye virtues in which thou ladde thy life that
thou will grant me thabou^daunce of thy grace / whereby I may profit in
daily encreasynge of all virtues to ye laud and glory of thy name. Amen.
Pater noster. Aue.

Of the baptym of our lord Ihesu. Capitulu^.x.
THankynges I yield to the lord Ihesu christ for that thou would be baptized of
thy holy servant saint John^ / when than for thy meekness the fader testyfyed
that thou were his only consubstancyall sone by his voice saying / here is my
well-beloved sone / in whom I am well pleased The holy ghoost also apperynge on
the in likeness of a dove. And this thou took not for thyselfe but for us to
halowe thereby our baptym and to make it a holsom sacrament of salvation for us.
Oration.
Lord Ihesu I thank y^ for my baptym whereby I am made a christian man / and for
that it pleased the I should be borne of christian parents / and in the time of
grace / and for that I am instruct in the true faith of thy church / and
where as many times I have defiled my baptym by sin and wickedness good Jesus
I pray the to cleanse me again by the sacrament of true penance / so that
after this mortal life I may appear before thy glorious face in the same
clennesse that I was in / in the time of my baptym. Pater noster. Aue ma.

Of the fasting of Ihesu in deserte / and of his temptacyons. Capitulum.xi.
THankynges I yield to ye lord Jesus christ that anon after thy baptym were
led in to deserte there labourynge in bytternesse of abstynence / in hunger /
in thirst / in cold / and hete / and suffered there also many other
infyrmytees of man / and there you did wake by night in prayer / and thou that

fasted.xl. days and.xl. nyghtes / and suffered the fend to tempte the. Oration.

said.xl. days and.xl. nyghtes and for all oxysons which at all times thou
prayed for us in the sight of god thy fader and for thy holy and perfyte
cogytacyons / words: and holy deeds send me grace to use abstynence and
vigylles / and make me holy and perfyte in all cogytacyons words and deeds to
the laud and glory of thy name. Pater noster. Aue maria.

glorious signs / examples / and good manners / and of diverse trybulacyons of
him in this world. Capitulum.xii.
I Laud and gloryfy the lord Ihesu christ for all the holy works that thou
wrought from ye day of thy holy baptym unto thy passion / for in that time
thou gadred the covent of thy dyscyples / and among them thou chase.xii.
apostles / that by them thou might subdue to the / the proud and high of this
world. And in those days thou opened the bosom of thy pity and mercy to all
them that came to the / and thou preched openly to all men remyssyon of sins
/ and entering of the kingdom of heaven. And often thou were fatygate and weary
of Iourneys and of cold / and sometime of feruor of hete / and in all this thou
suffered many persecucyons and sclaundres of the progeny of them that thou were
borne of / for in their words they said against the / and marked wrongfully
thy deeds / layenge wait on the by day and night / coueytynge contynually thy
death / resystynge the / and dyshonestynge yr by words / deeds and blasphemes
saying / this man is not of god / but a sinner and has a fend in him / he
maddeth in belzabub prince of fendes / he casts out deuylles / he begyleth
the people / he is a gloton / a drynker of wine / and the friend of publycanes.
These and many other blasphemes they said of the / and oftentimes they would
have stoned the / and all this thou suffered pacyently / and behad thyselfe
before them as a man not herynge / and as having no redargucyons ne
co^trauerces in his mouth And for as much as they were hard of heart and
slothful of believe / thou confermed thy words with tokens following. In
weddynges thou turned water in to wine. Of five loves and two fysshes thou
fed five thousand men. Thou walked upon the sea. Before thy dyscyples Peter
James and John thou were transfygured. Thou gave sight to blind men. Thou
made the dombe to speak / the defe to here / the creples to goo. Thou cured
lunatykes. Thou delivered possessed offendes. Thou raised deed men. Thou
cleansed lepers. Thou delivered a woman taken in aduoutry from condempnacyon of
death. Thou cleansed Mary mawdeleyn from sin. Thou heled the woman from the
flux of blood. Thou gladded the woman asking health for her daughter. The
woman that was incuruate and crooked xviii. years thou raised up right. When
thou were weary of thy Journey sitting and resting on the wells side to the
woman talking with the / thou gave her knowledge of the and of herself. And
in thy predicacyon thou stered the heart of a woman with thabou^daunce of thy
grace / that she cried in the mids of the people and said. Blessed be the
womb that bare the / and the pappes that gave the souke.



Of the entering of our lord Ihesu in to Iherusalem / and of his last souper.
Capitulum.xiii.
Blessed be thou lord Ihesu christ for the most holy teres of weeping which
thou wept at the monument of Lazar / and upon the cite of Iherusalem and for
all the wepy^ges that ever thou wept. And for thy humble and meke entering in
to Iherusalem / when thou sat on an ass before five days of Ester / for thou
came as a pascall lamb to be offered the syxte day for our sins / when the
hebrewe people met with the with flowers and palms cryenge and saying.
Blessed be he that comes in the name of the lord. And not long after the
night before thy passion thou made thy last souper with thy dyscyples /
saying to them these words. One desire is which effectually I have desired
to ete this pascall souper w^ you / that is plainly to say. I have fervently
desired to give you mine own body and blood / and to feed you therewith before
I suffer death for you. And after thou had eten the pascall lamb with them thou
dydest rise fro the table and put of thy garment fastnynge a lynnen cloth
about the / and full humbly thou enclyned thyselfe washing thy dyscyples
fete / and dryenge them with a cloth. And this done thou put on thy vesture
again / and sitting down eftsoon at the table thou said / know ye what I
have done to you. I lord and master have given example to you / that in
likewise as I have done so you to do the same. And among all other words that
thou spoke thou were troubled in spyryte / and protestynge thou said. Truly I
say to you that one of you shall be traye me. And herynge this they began to
be full sorry / and all they one after other said to the. Lord whether I am he.
And thou said to them / he that puts his hand with me in the dysshe / he it
is that shall betraye me. And the souper ended thou made a terminacyon of the
old testament beginning the new / when than with thy holy hands thou did
consecrate thy precious body and blood in form of bread and wine / fedynge
thy discyples therewith / gyuynge them auctoryte and by them to all priests to
the worlds end to do the same / when thou said these words. Do ye this into
my co^memoracyon. O what excellent love showed thou unto us good Ihesu in that
time when not only thou would dye for us / but also would feed us daily with
thy precious body and blood / that we should not hungre ne thirst for
evermore. And for that we sin daily against god / and thou might dye but ones
for us / therefore in this worthy sacrament you would daily be offered by the
hands of the priest to god thy fader for our cotydyan sins. And for as much
as we be in daily conflycte of battle with our cruel enemy the fend / thou
ordained such prouysyon for us that the percepcyon of this worthy sacrament
should be as a toure of strength for us against his cruel malice. And for
that we should have sure trust to obtain the kingdom of heaven / thou have
given us the sacrament of thy precious body to be a pledge or a wedde to us of
eternal glory / and to lead us the way to thy glorious kingdom. Oration.
Benygne Ihesu I pray the to give me grace so worthily to receive thy
precious body before my death / whereby I may attain the kingdom of heaven / for
faithfully I trust so on thy great mercy that thou will not exclude them from
thy heavenly kingdom / unto whom it pleases the to be knytte unto / by
connexyon of this honorable sacrament. Pater noster. Aue maria.

Of the prayer our lord made thryes on the mount of Olyuete. Capitulum.xiiii.
THanky^ges be to the lord Ihesu christ yt after thou had wrought the foresaid
mysteryes of consuetude thou went than to the mount of Olyuete / where before
thy passion thryes thou made thy prayer to thy fader of heaven / in Which most
devout prayer thou suffered in thy self a great conflycte / by reason to two
loves that were in the / one was by means of the love which naturally thou
had to thy humanyte / and in the other part by reason of ye fervent and
charytable love which thou had to man's soul / when by knowledge of thy
godhede thou called unto thy holy mind all the horrible passion that thou
should suffer for man in thy tender virginal body / wherefore such dread was
in the by reason of natural love which thou had to thyselfe that thou prayed
to thy fader saying. Fader if it be possible make and cause the chalyce of
this bitter passion to be taken fro me. But yet ye feruor of thexcellent love
which thou had to ye redempcyon and salvation of man's soul exceded far
thy first natural love / and in such manner overcame it and depressed it / that
in concludynge thy prayer thou said. Fader not my will in this petycyon / but
thyn be fulfilled and done. And after thou had prayed thus three times / the
dolorous passion that thou should suffer was so fresshely we bytternesse
prynted in thy holy mind / that for anguysshe of natural dread thou were cast
in to such an agony / that for the purete of thy complexyon thou swette blood
and water so that the pure drops of blood fell unto the ground. And than an
angel sent from thy fader appeared confortynge the. And notwtstandynge all
this in showing that thou loved man's soul better than thine own life /
thou left not to suffer bitter passion and cruel death for us. O good Ihesu
for thy holy prayer / bitter agony and excellent love which thou showed to us
send me grace to be devout to the in holy prayers / and hertely to love the
again for the sweet love thou have showed to me. Pater noster. Aue maria.

presented before the Judges / and of his illusyons. Capitulum.xv.
I Laud and gloryfye the lord Jesus christ that after thou were conforted of

thy traitor Judas / and after yt he had betrayed the with a kiss / all thy

thy hands behind the / that came to lose the band of our captyuyte / and
thou full mekely saydest to that company / as to a thief ye come with knyues
and staves to take me / when daily I was techynge in the temple / and ye did
not hold me / but now this is your hour and power of derknesse. And the
wicked persons carried the most meke lamb as a thief or a gylty man fast
bound and presented the first to Anna / and thou most wysest was there
examined of thy doctrine and of thy dyscyples / as though thou had been most
unwise. And you answered / that I spoke was openly said / therefore ask them yt
herd me what my words were. And thou lord of all thing were sore stryken by
ye hands of one that stood beside saying / why gyuest thou such answer to
y^ bishop. And thou answered again mekely / if I speak evil take witness of
evil / and if I said well why smytest me. Than Annas sent the fast bound to
Cayphas / before whom they made the lord of heaven to stand / to whom
thousand thousands of au^gelles assysteth in heaven beholdy^ge and lauding

And you that art ye high troth said no word / but suffered all thing equally /
and stood there in great pacyence and charity. God before men / the creator
before the creature. And when thou were asked and adjured / humbly you confessed
to be the sone of god. And they said that thou spoke blasphemes / and that thou
were worthy death / and they smote the cruelly on the face and on the neck with
their hands / and behad themself full malycyously against the after their
own will / not only despysynge the / the sone of god / but they forgate in
the all compassyon of humanyte / and they began to spytte in thy amyable face /
in the which au^gelles desires to behold / and they defiled y^ the most
beauteous in form and shape before all y^ children of men with the fylth of
rechynges and spyttynges of their loathsome mouths / and in derysyon they hyd
thy most bright eyes yt illumyneth heaven and earth / and they struck the full
scornefully saying. Prophecy now and tell who he is that smyteth the. And many
other blasphemes they put to the / and these wicked men without any mercy
sought means to slay the / not sparynge to smite the on the face / and thus
they vexed the all the night with iniuryes / despysynges / and passions. And erly
in the spring of the day the princes and senyours of prestes came together
taky^ge counsel how they might destroy the by most shameful death / and
they had the before them / asking whether thou were ye sone of god / and that
thou should show it openly. And thou answered confermynge that thou were the
sone of god. And they said / what other wytnes shall we desire / we have herd
it said of his own mouth. Than all the multitude rose up and led the forth
fast bound and presented the to Pylate the Judge accusynge the and saying that
thou were a subuerser and a deceyuer of the people / techynge over all Jury
unto that cite. Pilate herynge this caused the to be led to Herod / and thou
went thither full mekely and pacyently in the ways of our health. And when thou
were presented before Herod thyn enemies stood constau^tly accusynge the. And
Herod asked the many questyons / trusting to have seen some token or miracle
of the. But thou good Ihesu gave none answer / and would show no token /
but the sign and token of humylyte and pacyence. And they mocked thy goodly
prouydence / trowynge thy pacyence and humylyte to be fatuyte and ygnoraunce.
Therefore Herod with all his despised the / and in mockage they put on the a
white vesture in tokenynge of fatuite / and so with unhonest irreverently
Herod sent the to Pylate again. And that day because of the Pylate and
Herod were made friends that before time loved not other. And by the way as
thou went Ihesu mine only hope from one wicked man to an other thou were
illuded and weryed with sore percucyons and strokes. Oration.
Meke Ihesu I beseech y^ for all these irrysyons and vexacyons that thyn

Lord Ihesu christ sone of the ever living god I laud and gloryfy the for all

Pilate / and they would not enter in / but Pylate went out to them and said /
what accusacyon bring you against this man. And all they cried / if he were not
a malefactor we would not bring him to the. Than Pylate went again in to the
pretory and called the to him and said. Thou art the king of Jews. And thou
answered again / thou have said so. Than Pylate said to the / thy people and
bysshoppes has brought ye to me what have thou done. Thou answered / my
ky^gdome is not of this world / if my kingdom were of this world my mynystres
truly would make defense that I should not be yolden to the Jews. Pylate said
/ therefore than thou art a king. And you answered mekely / thou say that I
am a king / thereto truly I am borne / and for that I came in to the world
that I might bear witness of troth / and every man that is of troth hereth
my word And Pylate went out again to the Jews and said. I find no cause of
death in this man / therefore I will chastyse him and let him go. There is a
consuetude among you that I shall deliver you a prisoner at Ester / will ye
that I deliver to you the king of Jews. They answered nay not him but
Baraban. Than Pylate took the and made the personally to put of thy clothes /

hands about the pyller / and thyn enemies bound the fast / and the cursed
tyrants laid upon thy fair body tender and clean from every spotte of sin

apperynge of thy sides. Ibidem
And this was most bitter of all when they drew the knotty scourges they rent
away the flesh withal. And than good Ihesu thou stood all trembling and

Thankynges I yield unto the lord Ihesu christ that the third hour of the

setting the upon a stole they put a buystous garlonde of sharp thorns on thy

down pyteously from thy deuyne heed over thy face and neck / that therewith

And they beheld the with terryble eyes and cried. Crucyfy him. Crucyfy him.
And Pilate said I find no cause in him / therefore take ye him and crucify him.
Than they cried / we have a law and after the law he must dye for he names
himself the sone of god. Than Pylate entered in to the pretory and called the

went out and said to the Jews / behold your king. They denied and forsook
the to be their king saying / we have no king but Caesar. Truly Ihesu I

must fall on us and on our children. Than he delivered to them Baraban / and
Iuged the innocent sone of god to death. O good Ihesu for this terryble sentence

thy hands withdrewe themself a little from the place of perforacyon / and
than thy fete sustained much of the weight of thy body / Ibide^. I.
thy fyngers and arms somewhat extended themself and strongly strayned
themself upward to the tree / and with such bitter dolours thy heart brake
in sondee / and thy holy soul departed from thy blessed body and with the
godhede went down to hell / and brekynge up the gates of death took out all
holy souls which thou had thus redeemed setting them in the felycyte of
paradyse. And in the day of thyn ascencyon thou presented them whom thou had
bought with thy precious death to thy holy fader of heaven. And thou good Jesus
henge on the cross naked and so poor and nedy that thou had not whereon to
reclyne thy heed but at the last thou reclyned it on thy sholdre for four
causes. One was that thou might give a kiss to thyn espouse holy church and
to show her that all ye wrath of thy fader was mytygate and peasyfyed by ye.
The second was to ask a reclinatory in ye heart of man. The third thou
reclyned thy heed on thy sholdre as saying What should I have done more for ye
than I have done / show me for I am ready yet to do it for the and to help
the. The fourth as though thou said / trust verily in me / for that thou can
not do I may do it for ye. And in thy death good Ihesu creatures having no
reason wayled for the / for why / stones brake / monumentes opened / and many
bodies of holy men that were deed did rise. The veil of the temple did break
fro ye highest part unto ye ground And the son as sorowynge for the wtdrewe
his light that all ye world was derke. O ingratytude of reasonable man yt can
not sorrow for thy passion / for whom you suffered it so paynfully. Oration.
For this dolorous passion and death Ihesu I beseech the to be merciful to me
in the dredefull hour of my death / and grant me right mind and speech to yt
last end of my life / and yt I may have more my^de of the and of thy passion
than of the dolours and pains that than I shall suffer / and co^mendy^ge my
soul to thy blessed hands thou wylt receive her whom you have bought to the
glory yt has none end. Amen. Pater noster. Aue.

Of that the body of christ henge deed.iii. hours on y^ cross / and of the
opening of his side with a spear / and of certain vtylytees thereof.
Capitulum.xxvii.
THankynges I yield to the lord Ihesu christ for that it pleased the to
hang.iii. hours myserably deed on the cross / likewise as thou henge.iii.
hours a live in horrible tourmentes on the cross / and that it pleased the to
suffer thy holy side to be opened with a spear that blood and water
plenteuously ran out. And than were the gates of heaven opened to us / which
fro the time that Adam had sinned to that hour were co^tynually sparde against
us. And as our fytst mother Eve was fourmed of y side of Adam slepynge in
paradyse so our chaste mother holy church good Jesus of thy side which art the
second Adam hanging deed on the cross was fourmed / and all the sacraments
of the same our said good mother of thy foresaid precious wound took all their
strength and virtue. And where as by the transgressyon of our first parents
Adam and Eve all we were the children of perdycyon. So by the sweet Ihesu the
second Adam by thy passion and the sacrament of baptym we be made the children
of adopcyon And by the merytes of the same passion with help of the
sacraments of holy church thy chaste espouse our good mother / we trust
steadfastly to be the children of salvation. Oration.
O sweet Ihesu hertely I pray the that the merytes of thy precious wound /
with the help of the said blessed sacrament may open the gates of heaven to me
that after this mortal life I may have free entering there to dwell with the for
evermore. Amen. Pater noster. Aue maria.

Of the taking down of the body of christ fro the cross / and of his
sepulture. Ca. xxviii.
THankynges I yield to the lord Ihesu christ for that thou were taken down of
the cross by the besy labor of thy friends Joseph and Nychodeme / and thy
sorrowful mother received ye on her lap with full bitter wepy^ge / where thou
lay as a man all to drawn and torn in every member so pyteously dysfygured
that thou were more like a lepre than a clean man / and thy deed eyes were all
blody / Li. p^mo reuela. ca. x. ^
thy mouth cold as yse / thyn arms were so styffe / cold / and spredde
abroad as thou henge on the cross / that thy mother and friends aforesaid had
great business to bring them down to thy belly / and thy woeful mother wyped
and dried thy blody wounds with a cloth / and closed thy mouth and eyes which
were open by death / and this done thy wounded deifyed body was lapped in a
clean sudary and dressed with odoramentes / Ibidem
and laid and buried in the low place of the heart of the earth. Pater noster.
Aue maria.

Of the glorious resurreccyon of Jesus / and of his apparycyons. Capitulu^.xxix.
THankynges I yield to the lord Ihesu christ that the third day did rise
from death gloryfyed in body and soul with thy godhede / apperynge to thy
blessed mother as we mekely may ymagyn / and also to Mary mawdeleyn. And thou
met with the women coming from ye monument saying to them. All hayle ye.
And they came to the layenge hands on thy fete / and also the same day of thy
resurreccyon thou appeared to two dyscyples going to Emaus / and they knew the
in brekynge of bread. And again you entered to thy dyscyples the gates being
shytte and said. Peace be to you. I am dread ye not / and before them thou did
ete part of a roasted fysshe / and of a honey comb. And at the sea Tibertadis
thou showed thyselfe to thy dyscyples / and bread and fysshe which thou had
taken of them thou delivered to them / and full friendly thou comyned with them
/ and specially with Peter that had denied the / And after.viii. days again
thou appeared to thy dyscyples and gave them thy peace / and thou comforted
Thomas hard of believe / by showing of thy wounds to him. Pater noster. Aue
maria.

Of ye meruaylous ascencyon of our lord Ihesu. Ca. xxx.
THankynges I yield to the lord Ihesu christ / for all that ever thou did fro
ye day of thy glorious resurreccyon unto the day of thy meruaylous ascencyon
/ for fro that day oftentimes thou appeared to thy dyscyples / and to other thy
faithful friends / friendly confortynge them of the sorrow and heaviness which
they took for the in thy passion / and confermynge them in thy faith / hope /
and charity. And last of all thou ascended on the mount of Olyuete / and
lyftynge up thy hand thou gave them thy dyuyne benediccyon / and in the sight
of all that were there thou were lift up in to heuenwhere thou showed all thy
wou^des and vyctory to the sight of thy fader / and sitting at his right side
coomnipote^t and coeterne thou were crowned with glory and honor. Oration.
Lord Ihesu christ for the glory of thyn ascencion give me grace to follow ye
by grees of virtue from day to day / that after this life as a membre of thy
mystycall body I may be knytte to the ye heed of the same body in heaven bliss
for evermore. Ame^. Pater nr^. Aue.

THankynges I yield to the lord Ihesu christ that after.x. days of thine
ascencyon sendest down the holy ghoost after thy promise to thy dyscyples /
in likeness of tongues of fire brennynge / whereby they were so illumyned with
grace that with their mouths in the tongues of al nacyons they preched the
law of thy brennynge charity / whereof all the people meruayled. And
confermynge the words of their doctrine by open miracles they converted
innumerable people to thy faith / so that Peter in one day converted three
thousand from their error. Oration.
Benygne Ihesu I pray the to send me grace of the holy ghoost / and his sweet
consolacyon in all my works with the blessed gifts of him / whereby I may led
here an acceptable life unto thy pleasure / that I may thereby obtain the Joy
and glory that never shall have end. Amen. Pater noster. Aue maria. Credo in
