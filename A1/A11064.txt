TO THE RIGHT VIRTUOUS AND WORTHY KNIGHT, SIR THOMAS MOVNSON.
SIR, the general voice of your worthiness, and the many particular favors
which I have heard Master Campion (with dutiful respect often acknowledge
himself to have received from you) have emboldned me to present this Book of
Airs to your favorable judgment, and gracious protection; especially because
the first rank of songs are of his own composition, made at his vacant
hours, and privately emparted to his friends, whereby they grew both public,
and (as coin cracked in exchange) corrupted: some of them both words and notes
vnrespectiuely challenged by others. In regard of which wrongs, though his
self neglects these light fruits as superfluous blossoms of his deeper
Studies, yet has it pleased him upon my entreaty, to grant me the impression
of part of them, to which I have added an equal number of mine own. And this
two-faced Janus thus in one body united, I humbly entreat you to entertain
and defend, chiefly in respect of the affection which I suppose you bear him,
who I am assured does above all others love and honor you. And for my part, I
shall think my self happy if in any service I may deserve this favor.

Your Worships humbly devoted, PH^^^^ (...)

TO THE READER.
WHAT Epigrams are in Poetry, the same are Airs in music, then in their
chief perfection when they are short and well seasoned. But to clogg a light
song with a long Praeludium, is to corrupt the nature of it. Many rests in
Music were invented either for necessity of the fuge, or granted as a
harmonicall license in songs of many parts* but in Airs I find no use they
have, unless it be to make a vulgar, and triuiall modulation seem to the
ignorant strange, and to the judicial tedious. A naked Air without guide, or
prop, or color but his own, is easily censured of every care, and requires
so much the more invention to make it please. And as Martial speaks in
defense of his short Epigrams, so may I say in the apology of Airs, that
where there is a full volume, there can be no imputation of shortness. The
Lyricke Poets among the Greeks, and Latins were first inuenters of Airs,
tying themselves strictly to the number, and value of their sillables, of which
sort you shall find here only one song in Saphicke verse, the rest are after
the fascion of the time, eare-pleasing rimes without Art. The subject of them
is for the most part amorous, and why not amorous songs, as well as amorous
attires? Or why not new Airs, as well as new fascious? For the Note and
Tabl^ture, if they satisfy the most, we have our desire, let expert masters
please themselves with better. And if any light error has escaped us, the
skillful may easily correct it, the unskillful will hardly perceive it. But
there are some, who to appear the more deep, and singular in their judgment,
will admit no Music but that which is long, intricate, bated with fuge,
chaind with sincopation, and where the nature of every word is percisely
expressed in the Note, like the old exploided action in Comedies, when it they
did pronounce Memeni, they would point to the hinder part of their heads, if
Video, put their finger in their eye. But such childish observing of words is
altogether ridiculous, and we ought to maintain as well in Notes, as in action
a manly carriage, gracing no word, but that which is eminent, and emphaticall.
Nevertheless, as in Poesy we give the pre-eminence to the Heroical Poem, so
in Music we yield the chief place to the grave, and well invented Motet, but
not to every harsh and dull confused Fantasy, where in multitude of points the
Harmony is quite drowned. Airs have both their Art and pleasure, and I will
conclude of them as the Poet did in his censure, of Catullus the Lyricke, and
Vergil the Heroicke writer:

Tantum magna suo debet Verona Catullo:
Quantum parua suo Mantua Vergilio.

THough you are young and I am old, ^ ^ though you veins hot and my blood
cold, though youth is moist and ^ ^ age is dry, yet embers live when flames
do die. ^

The tender graft is easily broke,
But who shall shake the sturdie Oak?
You are more fresh and fair than I,
Yet stubs do live, when flowers do die.
Thou that thy youth do vainly boast,
Know buds are soonest nipt with frost,
Think that thy fortune still does cry,
Thou fool to morrow thou must die.

Follow her whose light thy light depriueth,
Though here thou live disgraced,

Had I foreseen what is ensued,

Dissembling wretch to gain thy pleasure,

When a woman is in danger.

^ IT fell on a summers day while sweet Bessie sleeping lay ^ ^ in her ^owre,
on her bed, light with curtains shadowed, la- my came she him spies ^ ^
opning half her hea- uie eyes. ^

Iamy stole in through the door,
She lay slumbring as before,
Softly to her he drew near,
She heard him, yet would not hear,
Bessie vowed not to speak,

She dreamp't not what he would do,
But still slept, while he smild
To see love by steep beguild.

Yet often my trembling eyes through faintnes close,
And then the Map of hell before me stands,
Which Ghosts do see, and I am one of those,
Ordained to pine in sorrows endless bands,
Since from my wretched soul all hopes are reft,
And now no cause of life to me is left.
Grief ceaze my soul, for that will still endure,
When my cra^'d body is consumed and gone,

ceasing pain, Then burst with sighing in her sight, And nere re- turn a-
gain. ^

All that I soong still to her praise did tend,
Still she was first, still she my songs did end,
Yet she my love, and Music both does fly,
The Music that her Echo is, and beauties simpathie;
Then let my Noates pursue her scornful flight,
and dyed for her delight.

My fortune hangs upon her brow,
For as she smiles, or frowns on me,
So must my blown affections bow,

It is a Meadow yet unshorne,
whom thousand flowers do adorn.
It is the heaunes bright reflexe,
weak eyes to dazzle and to vex,
It is th'Idea of her sex,
envy of whom does world perplexe.
It is a face of death that smiles,
pleasing, though it killes the whiles,
Where death and love in pretty wiles,

The sprites that remain in fleeting air,
Affect for pastime to untwine her tressed hair,
And the birds think sweet Aurora mornings Queen does shine,
From her bright sphere when Laura shows her looks divine.
Dianas eyes are not adorned with greater power,
Then Lauras when she lifts awhile for sport to loure,
But when she her eyes encloseth, blindness does appear,
The chiefest grace of beauty sweetly seated there.
Love has no fire but what he steals from her bright eyes,
Time has no power, but that which in her pleasure lies,

^ AYe me that love that love should natures works accuse, ^ ^ where cruel
Laura still her beauty viewes. River or cloud^^ (...), or crystal bright ^ ^
are all but servants of her self delight. ^

And that's the cause she is so stern to me,
Virtue and duetis can no favor gain,

^ SHall then a traitorous kis or a smile, all my delights unhappily be- ^ ^
guiles shall the vow of ^ay^^^ love (...) regard* when true service dies negle-
cted and ^ ^ wants his due reward? ^

Deeds meritorious soon be forgot,
But one offense no time can ever blot,
Every day it is renu'd, and every night it bleedes,
And with bloody streams of sorrow drownes all our better deeds.

^ IF I hope I pine, if I fear I faint and die, so between ^ ^ hope and fear
I desp'rat lie, looking for joy (...) come but hope is ^ ^ blind, joy deaf,
and I am dumb. ^

Yet I speak and cry, but alas with words of woe,
And joy conceiues not them that murmr so,
He that the ears of joy will ever pearse,
Must sing glad noates, or speak in happier verse.
^ ^ XVI.
^ Unless there were con- sent twixt hell and heaven that grace and ^ ^
wickedness should be combind, I cannot make thee and thy beauties even, thy face
is heaven, and ^ ^ tor- ture in thy mind, for more then worldly bliss is in

make sport thereat and more un- relenting grow. ^

2
What heart can long such pains abide,
Fie upon this love,
I would adventure farte and wide,
If it would remove,
But love will still my steps pursue,
I cannot his ways eschew,
Thus still helpeles hopes I prove.
3
I do my love in lines commend,
But alas in vain,
The costly gifts that I do find,
she returns again,

^ WHat is a day, what is a year of vain delight and pleasure? ^ ^ like to a
dream it endless dies, and from us like a vapor flies, and this is all the ^
^ fruit that we find, which glory in worldly trea- sure, ^

He that will hope for true delight,
With virtue must be graced,
Swee^e (...) yields a bitter taste*

^ Kind in unkindness when will you relent, and cease with ^ ^ faint love
true love to tor- meant still entertained, exclu- ded still I stand, her glove
still ^ ^ hold, but cannot touch the hand. ^

In her fair hand my hopes and comforts rest,
O might my fortunes with that hand be blessed,
No envious breaths then my deserts could shake,
For they are good, who such true love does make.
