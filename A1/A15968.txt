Imprinted at London in Paul's Churchyard, at the sign of thee Star, By
Thomas Raynald. and John Harryngton

To the right honorable and his singular good Lord, William, Marqu^she of
Northampton, Earl of Essex, Barone of K^ndal, Lord parre, and knig^t of the
most noble order of the Garter, your most bon^en orator at commandment,
John Hattington, wysh^th health, and prosperity with increase of v^rtue and the
mercy of God for ever.
COnsyderyng the manyfolde duties and abundant seru^ce that I owe unto your
good Lordeshyp (right honorable, and my Singul^r good Lord) I ca^ not, but see
infinite causes^ why I chiefly of all others ought (with all cheref^ll and
ready endeavor) to gratifye your good Lordshyp by all means possible, and to
apply my self wholye too thee same, as one that would gladly, but ca^ by no
mean^s able to do accordinglye as his bonde^ duette requires: I cannot, I say,
but se and acknowledge my self bou^de^, and not able to do soche service as
Iowe, both for the inestimable benefits yt your noble progenito^s, and also
your good Lordship has showed unto my parents and pr^dycessors: and also to
my self, as to one least able to do any acceptable service, though the will
be at all times most ready, In toke^ whereof, your lordship shall at all times
perceive, by simple things, that my ^ittel wit shall be able to inu^nt that if
mine heart could do you any service: no labor or travail should witholde me
from doing my duetie^ and that if busy labor and yt heart might be able to
pay the du^tye that love owes: your lordshyp should in no poi^t find me
ingrate or unthankful. And to declare this my redye will: I have dedicated unto
your name, this little treatise, which after I had perused and by thaduise of
others (better learned then my self) determined to put it in printe, that the
noble fame of so worthy a Knighte, as was thee Auctor hereof, Sir Thomas Wyat,
should not perish but remain as well for his syngul^r learni^g, as valiant deeds
in ^ne^cyal f^ates: I thought that I could not find a more worthy patron for
soch a ma^s work then your Lordship, who^ I have al^wayes known to be of so
godly a zeal, to thee furtheraunce of gods holy and a secret gospel, most
humbly b^sechynge your good Lordeshippe, herin to accept my good will, and too
esteem me as one that wissheth unto the same al honor, health, and prosperous
success.

AMEN.

Your good Lordshyppes most humble at commandment John Hartington.

The Prologe of the Auctor
Love to give law unto his subjects hearts
Stood in the eyes of Barsabe the bryghte
And in a look anon him selfs conuertes
Cru^lly pleasant, before King David's sight
First dased his ^yes, and further forth he s^art^s
With venemed brethe, as softly as he might
Touch his senewes, and over runs his bones
With ^^epynge fire, sparkeled for the nones
And when he saw, that kindeled was the flame
The noisome poison, in his heart he launced
So that the soul did tremble with the same
And in his brawle, as he stood and traunced
Yeldynge unto the figure, and thee frame
That those fair eyes, had in his pre^ens glaun^^d
The tor^^^ that love, had printed in his ^reste^
(...) ^o^oreth it, as a thing of thyng^s ves^e
So that he forgotte, the wysdom and ^or^caste
Wh^ ^he woo to realms, when that (...) does lack
Forg^^^^ge ^ke, gods Majesty as (...)
Y^a, a^^ his own, forthwyth he does to make
^rye to goo, into ^hee field in (...)
Urye I say: that was his Ieweles make
Under pretense, of certain victory
For enemies swords, a ready pray to be
W^ereby he may, enjoy her out o^ doubt
Whom more th^n God, or him self he myn^eth
And after he had brought this thing about
And of that lust, possessed him self he fyndeth^
That has and does reuerse, and cl^ne turn out
Kings from kingdoms, and cytyes vndermynd^th
He blinded thynkes this train, so blind and close
To blind al things, that nothing way it disclose
But Nathan has spied, out this trecherye
With ^uful ch^are, and settes before his face
The great offense, outrage and iniurye
That he has done too God, as in this case
By murder for too clooke adulterye
He shewethe eke from heaven, thee t^reates alas
So s^^rnly sore, this Prophet this Nathan
That al am^sed was, this woeful aged man
Like him that meateth with horror and with fear
The heat does straight forsake the lymyttes cold
The color ^ke droppeth down from his cheer
So does he feel his fire manyfolde
His heat, his lust, his pleasure all in scare
Consume and waste^ and straight his crown of gold.
His purple pauler, his scepter he le^teth fall
And to the ground, he throws him self with all
Then pompious pride, of state and dignite
Forth with rebate repentaunt humblenes
Thinner vile clothe, then clothed poverty
Does scantlye hyde and cladde his nakedness
His fair hoore bearde, of reuerente gravity
With ruffeled heir, knowing his wyckednes
More like was he, the same repentance
Then statelye prince, of worldelye gou^rnaunce
^ys harp he takethe, in hand to be his guide
Wherwyth he offreth, playnts his soul to save
That from his heart, dystylleth on every side
Wythedrawynge him self, into a dark cau^
Within the ground, where he might him ^yde
Flyinge the light, as in prison or grave
In which as sone, as David entered had
The darcke horror, did make his fault a drad
But without, prolongyng or delay
Of that, which might his Lord his God appease
Falls on his knees, and with his harp I say
Before his breast, frawted with disease
Of stormye syghes, deep draughtes of his d^caye
Dressed vpryghte, sekyng to conterpase
His songs with syghes and touching of the stringes
With tender heart, too thus to God he synges
Domine ne in furore
O Lord syns my mouth, thy myghtie name
Suffers it self my lord, to name and to call
Here has my harp, he taken by the same
That the repentance, which I have and shall
May at thy hand, seek mercy as the thing
Of only comfort to wretched sinners all
Whereby I dare with humble bemonynge
By the goodness of thee, this thing require
Chas^yce me not, for my deserving
According to thy ^uste conceived ire
O lord I dread, and that I did not dread
I me repent, and evermore d^syre
Thee to dread, I open here and sprede
My fault to thee, but thou for thy goodness
Measure it not, in largenes nor in bread.
Punish it not as asks thee greatness
Of thy furor provoked by mine offense
Temper, o lord, the harm of my excess
With mendyng will that I for recompense
Prepare again, and rather pytye me
For I am weak, and clean without defense
More is the need, I have of remedy
For of the hole, the ^eche takes no cure
The sheep that ^trayeth thee sheparde sekes to see
I lord am strayed, and seek without recure
Feel al my lymes, that have rebelled for fear
Shake in despair onelesse thou me assure
My flesh is troubled, my heart does fear the spe^r^
That dread of death, of death that ever lastes
Threateth of right, and draws nere and near
Much more my soul, is troubled by the blastes
Of these assautes, that come as thick as hayle
Of worldly vanities, that temptacion ca^les
Agayn^^ the bulwerke, of the flesh frail
Wherein thee soul, in great perple^itie
Fe^leth the senc^s, with the tha^ assayd
Consp^re corrup^^ by pleasure and van^ie
Whereby the wretch, does too the shade resort
Of hope in the, in this extremytie
But thou^ o lord, how long after this sort
Forberest thou, to se my myserye
Suffer me yet, in hope of some comfort
Fear and not feel, that thou forgettest me
Return (o lord) I beseech thee o lord
Unto thy old, wonted benygnitye
Reduce revive, my soul, be thou the leche
And reconcyle, the great hatred and ^^ryte
That it has had, against the flesh the wretch
That styred has thy wrath by fylthy life
Se how my soul, does freate it to the bones
Inward ^emorse, so sharpeth it like a knyfe
That but thou help, the caitife that be^o^^^s
His great offense, it turns anon to duste
Here has thy mercy, matter for the nones
For if thy righteouse hand, that is so just
Suffer no sin, or stryke with dampnation
Thy infynite mercy, want, needs it must
Subject matter, for his operatyon
For that in death, there is no memory
Among the dampened, nor yet no mencyon
Of thy great name ground of al glory
Then if I dye, and goo where as I fear
To think there on, how shall thy great mer^ye
Sound in my mouth, unto thee worlds care
For there is none^ that ^an the laud and love
For that thou will no love, among them there
Su^fer my cries, thee mercy too move
That wonted is, a hundred years offense
In a moment of repentance, to remove
How often have I called up with dyligence
This slothful flesh, long before the day
For to confess, his fault and negligence
That to the den, for ought that I could say
Has still returned, too shrowde him self from cold
Whereby, if suffers none for soche delay
By mighty playntes, instead of pleasures old
I wash my bed, with tears continual
To dull my syghte, that it be never bold
To stere my heart again, to soche a fall
Thus dry I up, among my foes in woo
That with my fall, do rise and grow wythall
And me be set even now, where I am so
With secret trappes, to trouble my penance
Some do present to me, my wepinge eyes
The chere, the manner, bewtye, or countenance
Of her^ whose look alas, did make me blind
Some other offer, to my remembrance
These pleasant words, now bitter to my mind
And some, show me the power, of my armoure
Triumph, and conquest, and to my head assynde
Doo^le dia^^me, some show favor
Of people frail, palace, pomp and riches
To the meremaydes, and their baytes of error
I stop my ears, with help of thy goodness
And for I feel, it comes alone of the
That to my harp, these foes have none access
Dare them bid, avoid wretches and flee
The Lord has heard, the voice of my complaynte
Your engynes, take no more effect in me
The Lord has heard (I say) and sen^ me faynte
Under your hand, and pytyeth my dystresse
He shall do make my senses, by constraynte
Obey thee rule, that reason shall express
Where that thee disceyte, of your glosing bayte
Made them usurp, a power in all excess
Shamed be they all, that so do lie in wait
To compass me^ by missing of their pray
Shame and rebuke, redownd to soche dysceyte
Soden confusion, as stroke with our delay
Shall so deface, their craftye suggestion
That they to hurt my health, no more assaye
Sense I, O Lord, remain in thy protection
The Auctor
WHo so has seen, the sick in his feuour
After truce taken, with the heat or cold
And that the fytte is paste, of his feuour
Draw fayntinge syghes, let him I say behold
Sorowefull David, after his languor
The with his tears, that from his eyes down rolled
Paused his playnte, and laid down his harp
Faithful record, of all his sorrows sharp
Yt seemed now, that of his fault the horror
Did make a ferde no more hy^ hope of grace
Thee threats whereof in horrible te^rour
Did hold his heart, as in despair a space
Till he had will, to seek for his succoure
Him self accusynge, beknowynge his case
Thinking so bes^e, his lord to appeace
And not yet healed, he fealethe his disease
Now seems fearful, no more the dark cave
That ers^e did make his fault, for to tremble
A place devout, of refuge for too save
The succurles, it rather did res^mble
For who had seen, so kneeling with in the grave
The chief pas^ure, of the hebrews assemble
Would Judge it, made by teres of penytence
A sacred place, worthy of reverence
With vapored eyes, he looked hear, and there
And when he has, a while him self bethoughte
Gatherynge his spirits, that were disdmayde for fear
His harp again, unto his hand he rought
Tunynge accord, by Judgment of his ear
His hearts botome^ for a syghe he sought
And there withal, upon the holowe tree
With strayned voice, again thus cried he
Beati quorum remiss sunt.
OH happy are they, that have forgeuenes got
Of their offense, not by their penitence
As by merit which recompenceth not
Al though that yet pardon, has not offense
Without thee same, but by thee goodness
Of him that has, perfytte intelligence
Of heart contrite, and covert thee greatness
Of sin, within a merciful discharge
And happy are they, that have the wylfulnesse
Of lust restraygned, before it went at large
Provoked by the dread, of Gods furor
Whereby they have not on their backs thee charge
Of other faults, too suffer thee dolor
For that their fault, was never execute
In open ^yghte, example o^ error
And happy is he, to whom God does impute
No more his fault, by knowledgynge his sin
And cleansed now, thee lord does him repure
As adder fresshe, new strypped from his skin
Nor in his sprete, is ought vndi^couered
I for because, I hid it siylle within
Thinckinge by state, in fault to be preferred
Do find by hyding of my fault my harm
As he that fyndeth, his health hyndered
By secret wound, concealed from the charm
Of leches cure, that else had, had ^edresse
And feel my bones, consume and wax vnferme
By daily rage, rorynge in ^xcesse
The heavy hand, on me was so encreaste
Both day and night, and hold my heart in press
With prickinge thoughts, by reuinge me my rest
That weth^red is my lus^ynes away
As somer heates, that have thee grain oppres^e.
Wherefore I did, another way assaye
And sought forth with, to open in thy sight
My fault, my fear, my fylthines I say
And not to hyde, from the, my great vnryghte
I shall quoth I, against my self confess
Unto thee Lord, all my sinful plyghte
And thou forth with did wash the wyckedn^sse
Of mine off^nce, of truth right thus it is
Wherefore they, that have tas^ed thy goo^nesse
At me, shall take example, as of this
And pray, and s^ke i^t^ me, for time of grace
Th^n shall the storms, and ^^uddes of harm
And him to r^^he, shall ^euer have the space
Thou art my refuge, and only ^auegarde
From the troubles that compass me the place
Such Joys, as he that scapeth his enemies ward
With losed bands, has in lybertye
Such is my joy, thou haste to me preparde
That as the sea man in his Ieopardye
By soden sight, perceived has the light
So by thy great mercyful propertye
Within thy book thus read I my comfort
I shall the teach, and give understanding
And point to the, what way thou shalt resort
For thy address, to keep the from wandering
My eye shall take the charge to be thy guide
I ask thereto, of the only this thing
Be not like horse or mule that men do ride
That not alone does his master know
But for thee good, thou must him betide
And brideled lest his guide he byte or throw
Oh diverse there are chastesinges of sin
In meat, and drink, in brethe, that man does blow
In sleep, and watch, in fretynge still with in
That never suffer rest unto the mind
Field with offense, that new and new begin
With thousand fears, the heart to strain and blind:
But for all this he that in God does trust
Wy^he ^^^cy^, shall him self defended find
Joyce, and rejoice, I say: you that be just
In him that mak^th, and holdethe you so still
In him your glory, always set you must
All you that be, of vpryght heart and will
The Auctor
This song end^d, David did sty^t^ his voice
And in that while, he about with his eye
Did seek the darcke cave, with which without noyce
His silence seemed, too argue and ^^^lye
Upon his harp, ^hys peace that did rejoice
The (...) so did call
And f^^^d^ mercy, at plentyfull mercy^s hand
Never denied, but where it was wythstande
As the servant, in his masters face
Finding pardon, of his passed offense
Considering his great goodness, and his grace
Glad tears dystylles, as gladsome recompense
Right so David, seemed in thee place
A marble Image, of synguler reverence
Carved in the rock, with eyes and hand on hygh^
Made is by craft, to plain, to sobbe, to syghe
This while a beam that bright son forth sends
That son the which was neue^ son could hyde
Perc^th thee cave, and on the harp descendethe
Whose glaunsing light, the world did over glyde
And such luyster upon the harp extendethe
As light of lamp, upon the gold cleave tried
The torn whereof into his eyes did s^e^te
Supprysed with joy, by pennau^ce of the heart
He more enflamed, with far more hot effect
Of God then he was erste of Barsabe
His left foot did on thee earth erec^e
Just thereby remaynethe the other knee
To thee left side, his wayght^ h^ does dyrecte
For hope of health, his harp again takes he
His hand, his tuyne, his mind sought his lay
Which to the lord, with sober voice did say
Domine ne in furore tuo.
O Lord as I have ye, both prayed and pray
Although in the, be no alteracyon
But that we me^, like as our selfs we say
Mesuryng thy Justice, by ou^ mutacyon
Chastise me not (oh lord) in thy furor
Nor me correct, in wrathful castygacyon
For that thy arrows, of fear, of Terror
Of sword, of sycknes, of famine, of fire
Sticks deep in me, I (loo) from mine ^rrour
Am pluck^d up, as horse out of the mire
With stroke of spur, such is thy hand on me
That in my flesh, for terror of thy ire
Is not one point, of f^rme stab^lytye
Nor in my bones, there is no stedfastnes
Such is my dread of mutabylyt^e
For that I know^^ m^ fraylfull wyckednes
For why? my sins above m^ head are bound
Like heavy weightes, that does my force oppress
Under the which I stoop, and b^we to the ground
As wyllow plant, haled by vyolence
And of my fles^he, each not well cured wound
That festered is, by folly, and n^clygence
By secret luste^ has ra^k^d under skin
Not duly cured, by my penytence
Perceiving thus, the tyranny of sin
That with weight, has humbled and deprest
My pride, by grudgyng of the worm within
That never dyeth^ I live with (...) rest
So are mine ^ntrayles I^f^^^ with fervent ^ore
Fedynge my harm, ^ my wel^^ oppreste
That in my ^leshe^, is (...) ^he therefore
So wondrous great, has been my vexacyon
That it forsced my heart, to cry and rore
O lord thou know, thinwa^de contemplacyon
Of my desire, thou know my syghes and plaintes
Thou know, the tears of my lamentacyon
Cannot express, my hearts inward restrayntes
My heart pantethe, my force I feel it quayle
My sight, my eyes, my look decays and fayntes
And when mine enemies, did me most assail
My friends most sure, wherein I set most trust
Mine own virtues, sonest the did fail
And stood aparte, reason and wyt^, unjust
As kyn unkind, were fardeste gone at need
So had they place, there venume out to thruste
That sought my death, by naughty word and dead
There tongues reproach, their wit did frawde apply
And I like deaf and dom, forth my way yede
Like one that here is not, nor has ^o replye
Not one word again, knowing that from thine hand
These things proceed, and thou lord shalt replye
My trust in that, wherein I s^ycke and stand
Yet have I had, great cause to dread and fear
That thou wouldeste give, my foes the over hand
For in my fall, they showed such pleasant chere
That there wythal, I always in the lashe
Abide the stroke, and with me every where
I bear my fault, that greatel^ does abashe
My doleful cheer, for I my (...) confess
And my de^erte, does al my co^fort^ dashe
In the m^ne while^ mine enemi^^ still en^rease
And my prouokers^ hereby do^ augmente
That without cause^ to hurt me do no ^^ase
In evil for good against m^ they be bente
And hinder shall, my good present of grace
Loo now my god, that see my whole entente
My lord I am, thou know in what case
Forsake me not, be not far from me gone
Haste to my help, haste lord, and have apace
O lord the lord, of al my health alone
The Auctor
Like as the pylgrime, yt in a long way
Faintinge for heat, provoked by some wind
In some fresshe shade lies down ^t mids of the day
So does of David, the weary voice and mind
Ca^e breath of syghes, when he had song this lay
Under such shade, as sorrow has assynde
And as thee tone, still minds his vyage end
So does the other, to mercy still pretend
On four cords, his fingers he pretendes
Without hearing, or Judgment of the sound
Down of his eyes, a stream of tears discendes
Without feeling, that tryckell on the ground
Is (...) that bledes in vayne^ right so Intendes
Thaltred senses to that that the^ are bound^
But lyghe and weep, he can no^^ other thing
And look up still, unto the heaven king
But who has been w^thoute the cave mouth
And ^earde thee tea^es^ and syghes that him did strain
He would have sworn there had out of the ^outh^
A luke warm wynd, brought forth a ^moky rain
But that so close the cave was, and vnkoweth
That none but god, was r^corde of his pain
^^s had the ^ynde blown, in all Israel ^ares
Of their king, the woeful playnte and tears
Of why^h son part when he up s^pped had
Like as he, who^ his own thought^ affairs
He turns his look, him seemed that the ^hade
Of his offen^e, aga^ne his force assayes
^y vyolente despair, on him too ^ade
St^rrynge like him, whom sodayn despair dismayde
His heart he straynes, and from his heart out bringes
This song that I note, wether he cries or synges
Miserere mei deus
RUe on me Lord, for thy goodness and grace
That of thy nature art so bountiful
For that goodnes^ that in thy word does brace
Repugnant natures^ in quiet wonderful
And for thy me^cyes, number with out end
In heaven and earth perc^aued so plentiful
That over al, they do them selfe^ extend
For his mercy, much more then man can sin
Do a way my sin, that thy grace offend
Often times again wasshe me but wash me well within
And from my sins, that thus makes me afraid
Make thou me clean, as ever thy wont has ben^
For unto thee now, none can be laid
For too prescrybe, ^emyssyon of sin
I^ heart r^tourned, as thou thy self has^e said
And I besnowe my fault, and any negligence
In my syghte my sins is fix^d fas^e
Thereof too haue^ more perfect penytence
To the abo^e^ to the have I tres^^s^e
For none can cure my fault, but thou alone
For in thy sight, I have not ben agaste
For to offend, judging thy sight as none
So that my fault, were hid from syghte of man
Thy majesty, so from my sight was gone
This know I, and r^pent, pardon thou then
Whereby thou shalt kepe^ stylle thy word stable
Thy justice pure and clean, because that when
I pardoned am, then forth with iusticiable
Just I am judged, by justice of thy grace
For I my self, loo, thing most unstable
Formed in offense, conceived in like case
Am nought^ but sin from m^ natyuytie
Be not these said, for mine excuse, ah alas
But of thy help, to show necessity inward
For loo, thou love the truth of the heart
Which yet does live, in most fydelite
Though I have fallen, by frail ouertha^rte
For wylfull malice, lead me not the way^
So much, as has thee flesh, dr^^en me aparte
Wherefore (O Lord) as thou have ^one always
Teach me, the hydden wysdom of thy lore
Since that my faith, does not ^^t decay
And as the Jews, to heal thee ^^pper ^ore
With Isoppe cleanse, cleanse me and I am clean
Thou shalt me wash, and more then snow therefore
I shall be white, how foul my fault has been
Thou of my health, shall gladsome tydinges bring
When from above, remission shall be seen
Discende on earth, thou shal^e for joy vpspringe
The bones, that were before ^^^^sumed to duste
Look not, oh Lord, upon my^^ offendynge
But do away my deeds, that are vniu^^e
Make a clean heart in the middell of my bres^^
With spyryt^ v^r^^g^t, ^oyded from ^ylthy^ lus^^
From thine eyes ^^re ^ast me not in v^res^e
Nor take from me, thee spyryte of holiness
Render to me^ joy of thy help and h^ste
My will confyrme, with the spirit of steadfastness
And by this, shall these godly things ensue
Sinners I shall, into thy ways address
They shall return to the, and thy grace sue
My tongue shall praise, thy justification
My mouth shall spread, thy glorious praise true
But of thy self, o God, this operation
It must proceed by purgynge me from blood
Among the ^uste^ tha^ I m^y^ have relatyon
And of thy lands for to let ^ut the floode
Thou must, oh lord my lyppes ^yrste unloose
For if thou haddeste, es^emed pleasant good
The outward deeds, that outewarde men disclose
I would have offered, unto the sacrifice
But thou delytest not, in no soche gloss
Of outeward deed, as men dr^ame and d^uyse
The ^acrifice, that the lord lyketh most
Is spirit contryte, low heart in humble wise
Thou do^ste acc^pte, o God, for pleasant host
Make Syon, Lord, according to thy will
Inward Syon the Syon of the host
Of hearts, Ieru^alem strength thy walls stylle
Then shalt thou take for good the outward deeds
Of a sacrifice, thy pleasure too fulfill
The Auctor
OF deape secrets, that David there did sing
Of mercy, or faith, of frayltie of grace
Of gods goodness, and of iusty^yinge
Thy goodness did so, astony him (...)
^^ who might sa^e, who has ^x^^^ssed this thing
^ sinner, I^ what have I saide^ a^ (...)
That gods goodness, wold^ with (...) ^onge entr^a^

And so he does but expressed by word
But in his harte^ he turnethe and payseth
Each word that his lyppes, might foorde abroad
He poi^teth, he pawseth, he wo^dreth, he prayseth
The mercy that hydethe, of justice the sword
The justice that so, his promise accomplysheth
For his words sake, to worthyles deserte
That gratis, his grace, to me^ does depart
Here has he comfort, when he does measure
Measureles mercy, to measureles fautes
To prodygalle sinners, Infinytye treasure
Treasure celestyall, that never shall ^efaulte
Ye, when that sin shall fail, and may not endure
Mercy shall reign again, whom shall not assaute
Of hell prevail, by whom lo, at this day
Of heaven gates, remyssyon is thee kaye
And when David, had pondered well and tried
And sees him self, not outterly depryued
For light of grace, that dar^ke of sin did hyde
He fyndeth his hoope much, there with reuyued
He imports on the lord, on every side
For he knowethe well, that to mercy is ascribed
Respecteles labor, importune, cry, and call
And thus begins his so^g, there wythall
Domine exaudi orationem meam.
LOrd hear my prayer, and let my cry pass
Unto the, lord, without Impedyments
Do not from me, turn thy mercyful face
Unto my self, le^uynge my government
In time of trouble, and aduersytye
Enclyne unto me, thine ear and thine entente
And when I call, help mine necessytye
Redely grant, theffecte of my desire
Boldelye too please thy Majesty
And eke my case, soch haste does well require
For like a synke, my days are past away
My bones dried up, as a furnace with the fire
My heart, my mind, is wythered up like hay
But I have forgott, to take (...) bread
My bread of life, thee word o^ truth I say
And for my paynfull syghes, and my dread
My bones my strength, my very force of mind
Cleued to the flesh, and from ye spirit were fled
As desperate, thy mercy for to find
So made I am, the soden pellycane
And like the owl, that flies by proper kind
Light of the day, and has herself betane
To ruin life, out of all company
With waker care, that with this woo began
Like thee sparrowe, was I Solytarye
That syttes alone, under y^ houses ^aues
This while my foes, conspyred contynually
And did provoke, the harm of my disease
Wherefore like ashes, my bread did me savor
Of thy just word, the taste might not me please
Wherefore my drink, I tempered with lycor
Of weeping tears, that from mine eyes did rain
Because I know, the wrath of thy furour
Provoked by right, had of my pride dysdayne
For thou dyddest lift me up, to throw me down
To teach me, how to know my self again
Whereby I know, that helpeles I should drown
My days l^ke shadow declyne, and I do cry
And the forever, eterniti^ does drown
World without end, does last thy memory
For this frayltie, that yoketh al man kind
Thou shall awake, and rue this myserye
Rue on Syon, Syon, that as I find
Is thee people, that live under the law
For now is time, the time at hand assynde
The time so long^, that thy servants draw
In great desire, to se that pleasant day
Day of redemynge Syon, from sins awe
For they have Ruthe, to see in such decay
In duste and s^ones, this wretched Syon lore
Then the gentiles, shall dread thy name always
All earthely kings, thy glory shall honor
Then when thy grace, thy Syo^ thus redemeth
When thus thou have declared, thy myghtie power
The lord his servants, wysshes and so estemeth
That him turnethe, unto y^ power request
To our dyscente, this to be written seems
Of all compfortes, as consolacyon best
And they, that then shall be regenerate
Shall praise the Lord, therefore both most and lest
For he has looked, from the high of his estate
The Lord from heaven, ^n e^rth has looked on us
To hear thee moan of them, that are algate
In soche bondage, to lose and o^ discus
The sons of death, out from their deadlye bond
Too give, thereby occasion glorious
In this Syon, this holy name to stand
And in Jerusalem, his laud^s lasting aye
When in one church, thee people of the land
And realms, ben gathered to s^rue, to laud, to pray,
The Lord that is above, so ius^e and merciful
But these feeble, runninge in thee way
My strength fails, to reach it at the full
He has abredged, my days they ^re not sure
To se that term, that time so wonderful
All though I have, with heart, will and cure
Prayed to the Lord, take me not away
In the mids of my years, though thine eu^r sure
Remain ete^^e, whom time can not decay
Thou wroughteste the earth, thy hands the heavens did make
They shall perysshe, and thou shall last always
And all things aye, shall were and overtake
Like clothe, and thou shall change the^ like apparel
Turn, and translate, and they in worth it take
But thou thy self, thy self remayneste hole
That thou was erste, and shall thy year extend
Then se^s to this, there may nothing rebelle
The greateste compforte, that I can pretend
Is, that the children, of thy servants dear
That in the world are got, shall without end
Before thy face, be stablyshed all in fear
The Auctor
WHen David, had perceived in his breast
The spyryte of God return, that was exyled
Because he knew, he has alone expreste
These great things, that grea^er spyryte compyled
As shawme or pipe, lettes out the sound impreste
By musyke art forged, to fore and fyled
I say, when David had perceived that, I wys
The spirit of compforte, in him reuyued is
For there upon, he makes argument
Of reconsylyng, unto the Lords grace
Al though sometime, to prophecy has lent
Both brute, beasts, and wicked hearts a place
But our David, judges in his entente
Him self by penance, clean out of this case
Whereby he has, remissyon of offense
And begins to allow, his pain and penitence
But when he weyt^, the fa^^^ and recompense
He dampneth his deed, and fyndeth plain
Attwene them two, no what equiualence
Whereby he takethe, all outward deeds in vain
To bear the name, of ryghtfull penitence
Which is alone, the heart returned again
And sore contryte heart, that does his fault bemone
And outward deed, the sin or ^^^te alone
With this he does defend, the slye assault
Of vain aloweance, of his own deserte
And all the glory, of his forgeuen fault
To God alone, he does it hole convert
His own merit, he fyndeth in defaulte
And whiles he pondered, these thing^s in his heart
His knee, his arm, his hand sustained his chinne
When he his song, again thus did begin
Deprofundis clamaui ad te domine.
FRom depth of sin, and from deep despair
From depth of deeth, from depth of hart^s sorrow
From this deep cave, of darken^s, deep repair
The have I called (O Lord) to be my borowe
Thou in my voice, O Lord, perceive and hear
My heart, my hope, my playnte, my overthrow
My will to rise, and let by grant appear
That to my voice, t^yne ^^^es do well attend
No place so far, that to the is not near
No depthe so deep, that thou ne mays^e extend
Thine ear sett^ thereto, hear the^ my woeful playnte
For Lord, if thou do observe, what men do offend
And put the natyue mercy, in restreynte
If just exactyon, demand recompense
Who may endure, O Lord, who shall not faynte
At soche account, deed, and no reverence
Should so run at large, but thou sekest rather love
For in thy hand, is mercyes resydence
By hope, wher^of thou doeste our hearts move
I in the Lord, have set my confydence
My soul soche truth, does ^uermore approve
Thy holy word, of eterne exc^ll^nce
Thy mercyes promise ^ that is all wa^e iu^^e
Have b^n my stay, my pillar and pr^t^nce
My soul in God^ hath^ more desirous ^ru^^
Then ha^h the wa^^^m^^ loking for (...)
By (...) ^^pe (...)

For gr^^^^^^ ^^uor ^re his pr^pet^^^
Pl^^^eou^^ ^ansome^ shall com^ with him I ^a^^
And shall redeem all our iniquity
The Auctor
This word, redeem, that in his mouth did sound
Did put David, it seems unto me
As in a trance, to stare upon thee g^ounde
And with his thought, the hyghte of heaven to see
Where he beholdes, thee word that should confound
The word of death, by humilite here to be
In mortal maid, in mortal habit made
Eternallye, in mortal veil too shade
He seyth that word, when full ripe time should come
Do away that veil, by feruente affection
Turn of with death, for death should have her dome
And lepeth lyghter, from soche corruption
The glute of light, that in the air does lome
Man redemeth, death has her destruction
That mortal vayle^ has immortalyt^e
Too David, assurance of his iniquity
Whereby he frames, this reason in his heart
That goodness, which does not forbear his son
From death for m^^ and can thereby convert
My death to lyf^^ m^ sin to salvation
Both can, and will a smaller grace depart
To him that sueth, by humble supplication
And syns, I have this larger grace assayde
To ask this thing, why am I the^ affrayde
He grants most, to them that most do crave
And he delyghtes, in suit without r^^p^cte
Alas, my son pu^sues me to the grave
Suffered by God, my sins for to ^orr^c^e
Bu^ of my sins, syns I may pardon hau^
My sons suyte, shall shortelye be reiec^e
Then will I crave, with suit confydence
And thus b^gynne the sucte of his pretense
Domine ^x^^di orationem meam.
HEar^ my prayer, o lord, hear my request
Complyshe my bone, supply thou my desyre^
Not for my desert, but for thine own behest
In whose firm truth, thou promised mine empire
To stand stable, and after thy justice
Perform, o^ Lord, that thing that I require
But of law, after the form and guise
To enter judgment, with thee thrall bond slave
To plede his right, for in soch manner wise
Before thy syghte, no man his right shall save
For o^ my self, lo, this my righteousness
By scorge and whyppe, and priekynge spurr^s I have
Scant ryse^ up, such is my beas^ lines
For that, mine enemies has put sued my life
And in the duste, has soyled my lustynes
Forreyn^ r^almes to fl^^ his rage ^o ry^e

And for bycaus^ (...) at st^y^e

And did peru^e^ thy ^or^k^s ^ ever last
Whereby I know a^^ue the ^ wonders al
Thy mercyes were th^n lift I up in have
My hands to the^^ (...) soul ^o the did call
Like bare soil for moyster o^ ^hy grace
Haste to my help O lord a^or^ I fall
For ever I feel, my spirit does fainte apace
Turn not thy face from me^ yt I be layede
In count of them, that headlinge down do pass
Into the pyt, show me be tunes thine aid
For on thy grace, I holly do depend
And in thy hands, since all my health is stayed
Do me to know, what way thou will, I bend
For unto the, I have raised up my mind
Rydde me (oh lord) from them that do entende
My foes to be, for I have me assigned
Always within, thy secret protectyon
Teach me thy will, that I by yt may find
The way to work, the same in a^fectyon
For thou my god, thy blessed spirit vpryght
In laud of truth, shall be my dyr^ctyon
Thou for thy name shall revive my spirit
Within the right that I receive by the
