The contented Couckould, Or a pleasant new Song of a New Castle man whose
wife being gone from him, showing how he came to London to her, and when he
found her carried her back again to New Castle Town.
To a very pleasant new Tune.


COm hither thou seaman brave
sir what do you require,
I prithee tell me if thou can
the thing that I desire,
See thou not my true Love,
see not my Lover go down,
And see thou not my true lover then
com thorough New Castle Town.
And metest thou not my true Love
by the way as you came
How should I know your true Love,
that have met many a one,
She is neither whit nor black
but as the heavens fair
Her looks are very beautiful,
none may with her compare,
She has ^al^ied her word
and left me here a lone
And see thou not my true lover then,
go thorough New Castle Town:
She has left me here alone,
alone here as you see,
And see thou not my true lover then,
since she has forsaken me,
Sure I saw your true love,
or else I saw such a on
In a gown and peticoat gay,
go through New Castle Town.
She went toward the sea
O thither ward did she bend
And with a very brave Coal shipe
to London she is wend
For when she went abo^*
she mickle was and merry,
Sure I did wish then verily
she had been in my wh^rye,
It Is now just two days since
that the ship went away,
That now a very great way o^,
th^^r ^^e^^ing on the sea,
O that was my true love,
O that was my lover true
Though she has now forsaken me,
and change me for a new
I never gave her cause,
why she should me forsake
But now alas she is gone to sea,
and an other corse does take.
But sure the winds and fa^es
did both together agree
Thus to carry a way my love
that has forsaken me
But though the winds,
did with the fates agree
Yet will I never forsake my love,
though she has forsaken me.
why has she left you alone,
an other for to take
That sometimes did love you so d^are
and her joy did you mak^,
I loved her all my youth
But now am old you see,
Love likes not the falling fruit
nor yet the Withered tree.
She is like a careless child
forgets her promise paste
She Is blind, she is death, when as she list
and in faith never fast,
Her desires is ^^ckel sound
and a trustles joy,
I won her with a world of ^ares
and lost her with a toy.
But since I have her love
I vow her for to follow,
Be it by land or else by sea
or yet through dep or shallow.
And if I so her find
I Will count her for min own,
O then ^ll bring her back again
unto New Castle Town,
The Second part. To the same Tune*


THe saylor rige thy shipe,
and thy tacles do provide
I tell you true that I do mean,
for to go the next tide,
Spread forth your sails abroad,
and drive into the mayn,
I pray you for to make great have,
wey anchor thou Jolly boat swayn.
For I think every hour,
for to be seven year,
Until that I do find my love,
I shall be in great fear,
For I (...) her for to seek,
I know not which way nor wheather,
But I would the winds and fates,
would graple our shipes together.
For many a boystrous blast,
here do I abid for thee
To^sing and tumbling on the se^,
though thou have forsaken me:
Yea greater pains I will,
five hundred times endure,
So I may win thy love again,
and thereof be made sur^.
But when that thou do hear,
the pains that I do take,
For to find thee out again,
thou will never me forsake,
And now to see the seas,
how smooth they are and plain,
Sure they do Calculat that I,
shall find my love again^.
And now at Grausend town,
we ar arrived at last
Let us with hearty prayers to God,
give thanks for dangers past,
Now farewell seamen all,
adieu, nay twis adieu,
And if I chance to find my love,
I Will carry her back with you.
For I will go down this tide,
allthough that it be late,
Where all the way he slept until,
be came to Billing gate,
But ere that he came their,
it was early in the morning,
Then he went up and down the streat,
as on that was forlorn.
First went he into Cheapside,
thinking his lover to find,
And after that to London-ston,
to satifie his mind,
So strayt thorough ^ower street,
he pased all along,
Where it was his chance to met,
his love with a ^ea^ringman.
But when the man espied
her husband was so nigh,
Then he made no more adow,
but run away presently,
Which when her husband spied,
unto his wife he came,
And kissed her their most lovingly,
who blushed for very shame.
Il that you will me forgive,
and count me for your own,
I would go back again with you,
unto New Castle Town,
At which words he was full glad,
that she so soon was wone,
Then prithee swet go back again,
unto New Castle Town.
Thus were they both a greed,
to go together home,
where we will leave them for a while,
going to New Castle Town.
Thus was the poor man glad,
that he had got his wife home,
But he for a cockold ever went,
in fair New Castle Town.
FINIS.
