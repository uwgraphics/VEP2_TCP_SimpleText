TO THE TWO HONORABLE KNIGHTS, SIR EDWARD HERBERT, OF THE NOBLE ORDER OF THE
BATH, AND SIR WILLIAM HARDY.
IT was long before the use of Notes and Tableture came in to our English
Press, but having found the way, there are few Nations yield more Impressions
in that kind then ours. Every Musition according to his ability increasing the
number. Among so many, I have now made one, yielding my private inventions
subject to public censure: To which adventure I was drawn by two reasons.
First, that I might show my humble duty, and grateful mind to you my two
Honorable Masters, whose bounty bestowed on me that knowledge (whatsoever it
is) that I have attained in Music; Next for that I am assured, that both the
worthiness of your Names, as also your loves to Music, and extraordinary
skils therein, either to express, or Masterly to compose, will be such a
protection to my devoted labors, that I shall not need to fear the black
breath of any envious detractor. All my desire is, that your favorable
acceptance will better them, for I shall esteem them as you receive them. So,
as my duty requires; I will daily pray for you both, as my bountiful
Masters, and worthiest Patrons.

Your humble servant, William Corkine.

I.
CANTVS.
^SInke down proud thoughts, your mounting hopes must ^ now descend, come
grief and care, hence joys, your triumph now must end. Heavens now will ^
smile no more, my light is sha - ded, I pine with - out re - dress, my life, ^
my spirits like flowers are fa - ded. ^

1
Sink down proud thoughts, your mounting hopes must now descend,
Come grief and care, hence joys your triumph now must end,
Heavens now will smile no more my light is shaded,
I pine without redress, my life my spirits like flowers are faded.
2
O time (...) my woe, in mine own tears drown my distress,
Griefs none should know, when none their anguish can redress,
Pale Death has pierst my blood, and forth it streameth,
I sleep, and in my trance, my head my heart of sorrow dreameth.
BASSVS.
^SInke down. ^

II.
CANTVS.
^SOme can flatter, some can feign, simple truth shall plead for me ^ Let
not beauty truth disdain, Truth is even as fair as she. ^

2
But since Paires must equal prove,
Let my strength her youth oppose,
Love her beauty, faith her love,
On even terms so may we close.
3
Cork or Lead, in equal weight,
Both one just proportion yield,
So may breadth be pays'd with height,
Steepest mount with plainest field.
4
Virtues have not all one kind,
Yet all virtues merits be:
Diverse virtues are combind,
Differing so Deserts agree.
5
Let then love and beauty meet,
Making one divine concent,
Constant as the founds, and sweet,
That enchant the firmament.
BASSVS.
^SOme can.

III.
CANTVS.
^SWeete restrain these, Showers of kindness, from distrust proceeding, Nurse
not wrong con - cei - ued blindness, by to much sigh breeding, ^ Love by error,
seems a stray, But dies if once suspected. Women most be-leeue when they most
by men are neglected. ^

1
Sweet restrain these showers of kindness,
From distrust proceeding,
Nurse not wrong conceived blindness,
By too much sigh breeding.
Love by error seems astray,
But dies if once suspected,
Women must believe when they,
most by men are neglected.
2
Some, forged flatteries only venture,
Yet return true favors,
Just affection like a Center,
Once fixed never wauers:
Easily as the day from night,
May women's eyes discover,
If they frame their minds aright,
From the false the true lover.
BASSVS.
^SWeete restrain. ^

IIII.
CANTVS.
^ IF streams of tears, Could ^ lessen extreme grief, or cause a minutes
truce to woe, If ^ deepest sighs, Sad plants might yield re - liefe, these
sorrows to for - go, Mine eyes ^ my heart, my tongue should near re - fraine
to weep, to sigh and to com - plain, ^ But sorrow such impression left, of
sight of speech, it me bereft, only to sigh..ij ^ ^.ij. to sigh, to sigh, is
left to me, in this my grea - test mi - se^ - rye. ^

BASSVS.
^ IF streams. ^

V.
CANTVS.
^SWeete sweet.ij. Let me go, sweet.ij..ij..ij. let me go.ij. ^ What do
you mean to vex me so, What do you mean to vex me so, cease.ij..ij. Your
^ Pleading force do you think thus, To extort remorce, now, now,.ij..ij. now
no more..ij..ij. alas ^ you over bear me, And I would cry, And I would cry,
And I would cry,.ij. ^ But some would hear I fear me. ^

BASSVS.
^SSweete, sweet. ^

VI.
CANTVS.
^HEe that has no mistress, must not wear a favor, he that wooes a ^
mistress, must serve be-fore he have her, he that has no bedfel - low, must lie
a - lone, and he that has no ^ Lady, must be con - tent with Ione, and so must
I, for why alas my love and I am parted, my ^.ij. False Cupid I will have thee
whipped, and have thy mother carted. ^

BASSVS.
^HEe that has. ^

VII.
CANTVS.
^SWeete Cupid, ripen her de - sire, thy joyful harvest may begin, ^ if age
ap - proch a lit - tle nyer, twill be too late, twill be too late, twill be too
late to ^ get it in. If ^

1
Sweet Cupid ripen her desire,
Thy joyful harvest may begin,
If age approach a little nyer,
Twill be too late too get it in.
2
Cold Winter storms lay standing Corn,
Which once too ripe will never rise,
And lovers wish themselves unborn,
When all their joys lie in their eyes.
3
Then sweet let us embrace and kiss,
Shall beauty shale upon the ground,
If age bereave us of this bliss,
Then will no more such sport be found,
BASSVS.
^SSweete Cupid. ^

VIII.
CANTVS.
^ Vain is all this worlds contention, Fortunes frail, and ^ hopes de - cei -
uing, Chance lays ambush of prevention, Our atempts of end bereuing, ^ fu -
ture thing are plast beyond our weak concei-uing minds in every age new, ^
thoughts engender till all to fate we render. ^

BASSVS.
^VAine is all. ^

IX.
CANTVS.
^ BEau - tie sat ba - thing by a ^ Spring, where fairest shades did hide her,
the winds blewe calm, the Birds did Sing, the ^ cool streams ran be -
side her, my wanton thoughts in - tis't mine eye to ^ see what was for -
bidden, but better memory said, Fie fie fie fie fie fie.ij. ij. ii. ^ fie
fie,.ii..ii. fie, So vain de-sire was chidden, so vain de - sire was chid -
den. ^

2
Into a slumber then I fell,
But fond imagination
Seemed to see, but could not tell,
Her feature or her fashion.
But even as babes in dreams do smile,
And sometime fall a weeping:
So I awake as wise the while,
As when I fell a sleeping.
BASSVS.
^ Beauty sat. ^

X.
CANTVS.
^ NOw would chwore hong'd, zis but thou most ma wrong, gods bors I ^ cry God
mercy to zweare, have not my Rings and things, and gear with vaith and troth,
among and ^ wout vorzake ma now,.ij. nay mass ware that,.ij. vor if thou do,
chil take a knife and honge my ^ zelfe vor one of thou, yea I woll, so I woll,
that I woll, I vaith la,.ij. ^

Hadds voote zweete zis what aild tha woo ma now,
I cham as like to zarue thy turn,
As yer I was zince chos I borne, and sha not I have thou,
Lets zee who dare I chould but zee huds lid I zweare,
Chill take a zweard and make a yend of I or he,
Yea I would, etc.
Ha not I bought my Kerzie wedding briche,
Hudds hate cham angry thou makes ma vr et,
And is not my bond ready zet, woold zarue ma zucha twich,
Chill break his brow, I vaith, I chill that shall love thou,
Then take a rop and drown thy zelf vor mere good will,
Yea I would, etc.
BASSVS.
^NOw would chowre. ^

XI.
CANTVS.
^ Think you to seduce me so with words that have no meaning, Parets can learn
^ so to speak our voice by pieces gleaning, Nurses teach their children, so
about the time of ^ weaning nurses. ^

1
Think you to seduce me so with words that have no meaning,
Parets can learn so to speak our voice by pieces gleaning,
Nurses teach their Children so about the time of weaning.
2
Learn to speak first, then to woe, to woeing much pertains,
He that has not Art to hide, soon falters when he faineth,
And as one that wants his wits, he smiles when he complains.
3
If with wit we be deceived, our falls may be excused,
Seeming good with flattery graced, is but of few refused,
But of all accursed are they that are by fools abused.
BASSVS.
^ Think you to seduce. ^

XII.
CANTVS.
^ SHall a frown or angry eye, Shall a word unfitly placed, ^ Shall a shadow
make me fly, as I wear with Tigers cha - ced, Love must not be so disgra -
ced, ^ Love must not be so dis - gra - ced. ^

1
Shall a frown or angry eye,
Shall a word unfitly placed?
Shall a shadow make me fly,
As I were with Tigers chaced?
Love must not be so disgraced.
2
Shall I woe her in dispight?
Shall I turn her from her flying?
Shall I tempt her with delight,
Shall I laugh out her denying?
Noe, beware of lovers crying.
3
Shall I then with patient mind,
Still attend her wayward pleasure,
Time will make her prove more kind,
Let her coyness then take leisure,
Pains are worthy such a treasure.
BASSVS.
^ SHall a frown. ^
