ane premonitioun to the barnis of Leith
ANe Cunning Clerk Experience
And Master of Intelligence,
New landit in Inchekeith:
This lytill Sedull schortly sends
To all that the good cause defends
That is the barnis of Leith.
Because I hard of ane Conue^tion
Now to be maid for this dissentioun
That is into this land,
That anis their may be final pace:
How sone I understood the case,
I maid me to frahand.
To send this Sedull in a gayth
That nane of ow kep any skayth
For laik of Premonitioun:
For ofttymes into treating trewis
Cu^is tydingis yat richt money rewis
Be Tratorie and Seditioun.
As for exempillis gif I list
I have anew wald I insist
Both Forane and at hame
Bot to my purpois to proceid
Of peace and concord their is neid
In pure Scotland be name.
Quhilk never in sic perrell stude
Sen that our Lord deit on the Rude
Foull fall them hes the wit:
For it is ouirgane with a flude,
Of murder and of saikles blude:
Allace for leif to flyte.
Scotland this blude has first begun,
And lang in bludschedding hes run,
Ane Patron of mischief:
The rest at it beginnis to leir
Allace that pity is to heir
I pray God send releif.
For innoce^ts ar murtherit down
Without remors in land and town,
Quhat leid may leif on life:
And they hald gait I trow frahand
Sic murder salbe in all land
Of Children man and wife.
That seis als greit as Noyis flude
Sall drown ye world of ma^is blude
Quhat mischief do they mean:
one cursit battle as I trow
Quhilk they at Trent did all anow
They think now to sustene.
For murtherars dois all confidder
They and ye Papists rynis togidder
They ar ane blyssit pak.
And their were not a God abone
I wald be fleit I tell ow, sone
That all should gang to wrak.
Bot sa lang as our God dois Ring
^uhilk salbe ay without ending
We neid not for to feir.
Thocht yat should all tin by yair mind
Our God to us salbe sa kind
They sall us never deir
Bot it sen both in France and heir
They have one butt as dois appeir
That is to cut all down,
That Justice lufis and haitis vice
Thairfoir my ladds of Leith be wice
e ken our warisoun.
I pray ow all be circumspect
our enemeis dois not neglect
Occasiounis to ouirfyle ow,
And git they may* they will not spair
Outher be foull play or be fair,
Agane it to begyle ow.
e have mair neid them now to feir
Nor quhen they come in feir of weir
Down to the Gallow Ley:
For than e knew they were our fais
Bot now they cum in friends clais
Quhilk is ane sairer sey.
I speik not this that e should stay
From our Co^uentiou^ and our day
Or any wayis dissaue them:
Bot that e may provide befoir
To have ane pyn for every boir,
And to be richt war with them.
e know their faith in times past
Thairfoir luke that e festin fast,
And tak good tent about ow:
For trewly and e be not wise
e sall not mys to se ane gyse
That sall not weill content ow.
And it I rid yame leave yair tressou^
And euin be weill content of ressoun,
Sen Fortoun with a Reill
Hes wrocht them ane vnabill charr
And blawin them blind or they were war
With turning of her Quheill.
For quhy befoir they did pretend,
The Quenis authority to defend,
To gar men trow they lude her:
Howbeit yai wald haif wist her swouma^d
Intil a bait upon Lochlowmo^d
But boddum air or Ruther.
Thairfoir her cause they did procure
Because yai thocht yat scho was sure
And keipit to their hand:
Bot it sic farleis hes been seen
That France will haif her brocht hame Queen
And fred out of Ingland.
And gif that be I wald they wist,
That su^ of them mon flit their Kissed,
For all this brawling beir:
Bot silly saulis they ar sa daft
They ken nathing I trow, bot craft:
They ar bot it to leir.
It were ane pity to begyle them
I wald blind Iamie wald gang wile them
The moyane for till find:
How that yai micht eschew ye queen
And that they micht (the parrel seen)
Go saill ane other wynd.
ea thocht sum leuch and sum did da^ce,
Quhen their blak tydingis come fra France
Blind Iamie tauld me else.
That quyetly yai news did fyk yame
And sum of them dois euin mislyke them
Als mekle as our sells.
Thairfoir I trow and they be wise,
They sall leave of their Interpryse
And rather gre with ow:
Nor with the house of Guyis to mell
Quha is als godles as their sell
And kens their gymps I trow.
for get yat house yair hand abone yame
I wed my heid yat yai sal tone yame
And trym yame for their triks:
e they can think on auld done deids
For brint barn the fire ay dreids,
They will not thole sic prikis.
I wald fane warn ow of al dangers
I cou^sal ow be war with strangers
That halds ow both in hand,
I dreid e ly lang be the eiris,
Or they think time to end the weiris
And troubill in this land.
It were good gif e culd aggre
Amang our selfis and let them be
e may wit quhat I mean:
for quhe^ yat strangers reuls our roist
It will be sure on Scotlands coist
As hes been hard and seen.
And were e weill aggreit I tell
Than Scotland micht do for the sell,
And set als lytill by them
As they do it for all their power
they wald be fane to seik our favor
And to ow als apply them.
Bot till aggre and e delay
Than Scotland will be bot ane pray
As will be schortly seen:
Till gredie Gormondis waitand on
Quhen they may se occasion
To rute ow all out clean.
For sword and derth hes ow oppressed
And also e have felt the Pest
Bot it few dois amend:
Than desolatioun is the last,
Of Gods plagues quhe^ their ar past,
Quhilk doutles he will send.
ea I foirspeik ceis not their weiris,
The time sall cum within few eiris
That nane of Scottis blude:
In Scotland dar him self anow,
Mair nor in Jury dois the Iow
For feir of Natiounis rude.
Than sall our pure posterity
In wandering wide fra this country
Amang all other Natiounis.
Cry out and murne with woeful cheir
That pity salbe for till heir,
Their kind of exclamatiounis.
Allace that ever they were borne,
That dwelt in Scotland us beforne
And loist us sic ane land,
quhilk our forbears a^s thocht ours
With plesa^d castells townis and towrs
And all things at command.
Sum Lords sum Lairds su^ les degree
Their commoun wealth and policy
As any Natioun had,
And now na Scottisman dar be their
Allace quhat heart will not be sair
To se Scottismen sa sad.
Than sall they wary curse and ban
The murtherars yat yir weiris began
Quhen Chronickles they reid,
Tha^ Edinburgh that Castle strange
Sall wareit be that stude sa lang
Sic murder for to feid.
Thairfor yir plaigs wald yai eschew
I counsall them in time to rue
And their mischief repent:
Quhilk gif they do e may aggre
Bot vtherwise na pace salbe
Thocht e thairto consent.
For thocht that Saul will Agag spaie
it God will have his will but may
Fulfillit or he sace:
Gif this e do not understand
Speir at John Durie or John Bra^d
They will expone the place.
thocht murtherars says yat yai thrist blude
it let na nobill me^ of good
Be craft that was brocht on it
And rewis yat yai haif taken sic part,
Repenting trewly from their heart
Feir, thocht Iohne Knox expone it
Bot gif yat they grow proud and heich,
And skar at ow as they were skeich,
And on na wayis will bow them
Let yame pas on to their defensis
It salbe on their awin expensis
Or all be done I vow them
Than quhidder e conuene or nocht,
Keip their premissis in our thocht
e that of Leith ar barnis:
The abstinence drawis neir ane end,
Thairfoir I pray ow now attend,
Think on Experience warnis.
FINIS.
