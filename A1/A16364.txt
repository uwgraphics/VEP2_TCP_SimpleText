An honest godly instruction, and information for the tradynge, and bringinge
up of Children, set forth by the Bishop of London. Co^maundyng all
scholemaisters and other teachers of youth within his Diocese, that they
neither teach, learn read, or use any other manner of ABC, Catechism or
rudimentes, then this made for the first instruction of youth. Mense Ianuarii.
1556.

Cum priuilegio ad imprimendum solum.

FOrasmuch, as it is a meritorious deed, to instruct youth in virtuous things,
which youth, of it self, is prope^se, and ready, without any teacher, to
take, and embrace vice, unthriftiness, and all manner noughtinesse, it is thought
good (seeing of late days, the youth of this realm has been nouseled with
ungodly Catechismes, and pernicious evil doctrine, which is to be feared,
they will not forget, in as much, as the new vessel long does keep the sent or
sauoure, of the first liquoure, wherewith it was seasoned, according to the
old proverb: Quo semel est imbuta recens seruabit odorem testa diu: And that
also the youth must have some honest introduction, and entrye in things
convenient for them to learn, that is to say: both to know the letters,
with ioyninge of them together, and thereby the sooner made apt to go further,
both in reading, and also in writing) it is thought good I say, seeing the
elder age is provided for in necessary doctrine already set furthe, that the
said youth should also have some help herin. For which purpose, here briefly
is set furthe for them, as well letters of diverse sorts, commonly used in
this realm, as also syllables, and ioyninge of the said letters together. And
as for words, sentences, and matters, such is here in this behalf set also
forth, as is judged to be most necessary, apt, and requisite for the said
youth to learn. As first to know how to bless them selves morning and
evening: to say also the Pacer noster the Aue Maria, the Creed, the Confiteor,
with the rest to answer the Priest at Mass: to say grace at diner and
supper: To say the de profundis: To know and learn upon the book, and by
heart, the ten commandments of almighty God, given in the old law: The
two commandments of God, expressed in the Gospel: The.vii. principal
virtues: The.vii. works of mercy bodily: The.vii. works of mercy gostly, or
spiritual: The.vii. gifts of the holy ghost: The.viii. beatitudes: The.vii.
sacraments: To know by the book, and thereby to avoid, the seven deadly
sins. All these things (jointly, in Latin and in English, for the youth, to
learn thereby to read both the tounges) are set forth by the Bishop of
London, to be taught by all the scholemasters unto the youth within his said
Diocese of London. Straythe chargyng, and commau^ding, all the said
scholemasters, and all manner of other persons, within his said diocese,
neither to teach, learn, read, or use, any other manner of ABC Catechism, or
rudimentes, then this, made for the first instruction of youth.
