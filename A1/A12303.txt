A Skeltonicall Salutation,
Or condign gratulation,
And just vexation
Of the Spanish Nation,
That in a bravado,
Spent many a Crusado,
In setting forth an Armado
England to invado.


Imprinted at London for Toby Cook. 1589.

A SKELTONICAL salutation.
O KING of Spain
Is it not a pain
To thy heart and brain,
And every vain,
To see thy train
For to sustain
Withouten gain
The worlds disdain,
Which does despise
As toies and lies,
With shoutes and cries
Thy enterprise,
As fitter for pies,
And butter-flies,
Then men so wise?
O waspish King,
Where Is now thy sting,
Thy dart, or sling,
Or strong bow-string,
That should us wring,
And vnderbring,
Who every way,
Thee vex and pay,
And bear the sway
By night and day,
To thy dismay,
In battle array,
And every fray?
O pufte with pride,
What foolish guide
Made thee provide
To over-ride
This land so wide
From side to side,
And then untried,
Away to slide,
And not to abide,
But all in a ring
Away to fling?
O conquering,
O vanquishing
With fast flying,
And no replying,
For fear of frying!
So hurt us still,
As often as you will,
So fight your fill,
So show your skill,
So sincke us, and sack us,
So burn us, and wrack us,
So cleave us, and crack us,
And rent us, and rack us,
Or if you will remain
In Castile, or Spain,
And not venture again,
Our force to restrain,
If you so it please,
You shall take your ease,
To cure your disease,
You have got by the seas.
And though we be pore,
We will come to your shore.
And kno^ke at your door,
As often heretofore.
And spare you the cost,
Which of l^te you have lost,
When as you were tossed,
From pillar to post,
To your small bost.
And cast on the sands,
And many Islands,
Into your enemies hands,
And many a rock,
With many a knock,
For a laughing stock,
And a jest, and a mock,
But who but Philippus,
That seeks to nip us,
To rob us, and strip us,
And then for to whip us,
Would ever have meant,
Or had intent,
Or hither sent,
Such ships of charge,
So strong and so large,
Nay the worst barge,
Trusting to treason,
And not to reason,
Which at that season,
To him was geson,
As does appear,
Both plain and clear,
To far and near,
To his confusion,
By this conclusion,
Which thus is framed,
And must be named
Argumentum a minore.
Cum horrore and timore.
If one Drake o,
One poor snake o,
Make us shake o,
Tremble and quake o,
Were it not trow ye,
A madness for me,
To undertake,
A war to make,
With such a land,
That is so mande,
Wherein there be
Of certainty,
As hungry as he
Many a thousand more,
That long full sore
For Indian gold,
Which makes men bold?
But you were blind,
As now you find,
Till in your kind
You have well tasted
How you are wasted,
With all your bragges,
Gennets, and nagges,
And money bags:
Whereof the most
The Irish cost,
As a good host,
Does now possess,
With thankfulness,
And can no less,
Than the time bless,
That you set out,
And came about,
With all your route,
So proud and stout.
But woe to the heart,
That feeling smart,
For just desert,
Growth worse and worse,
And God does curse,
And cannot repent,
But keeps intent,
Come six, or seven,
Come hell, or heaven,
To undertake,
With all he can make,
A new invasion,
At the Popes persuasion.
But Spaniard proud,
The Lord has vowde
He will defend,
Unto the end,
His Church and sheep,
That his law keep.
Wherefore to be short,
I thee exhort,
For thine own comfort,
If wit thou have,
Think him a knave,
That does advise
Such an enterprise:
For in this cause,
Our Faith and Laws,
We will sell our lives,
Our lands, and wives,
Too dear for thee,
When soever it be,
And ere it be long,
Make thee sing a song,
Of O siscivissem,
Me continuissem,
Et nonfecissem.
But now Pope bliss him,
And Mydas kiss him,
And so I dismiss him,
To his good Physician,
Master Inquisition,
By whose disposition,
He takes the diet,
That will him disquiet,
And turn vp-side down,
(Which would make a man frown)
Both kingdom, and crown,
And fame and renown,
And so sirs valete,
Et vobis cavete,
A medicis ignaris.
Chirurgis avaris,
Meretrice Romana,
Insulsa, and insana,
Et factione Guisiana.
Except you be so expert,
That you can convert,
At your own pleasure,
Which were a great treasure,
The Lutheran seas,
Which do you displease,
To be of your faction,
And join in your action.
Or some way can find,
To master the wind,
Or else so to bind,
That it be to your mind.
And then regnate,
Et prae gaudio cacate,
Per omnia monasteria monachorum.
A Question annexed, touching our seafish, nourished with Spanish blood.
But now must I call,
My contrymen all.
And you Scotsmen tall,
And Irish rugges,
That were such hugges,
To the Spanish pugges.
As never were seen,
With your skeynes so keen,
So bright and cleene.
To tell you a surmise,
That of late did rise,
Which is to advise,
With the learned and wise
Whether for this year,
It were not best to forbear,
On such fish to feed,
Which our coast does breed,
Because they are fed,
With carcases dead,
Here and there in the rocks,
That were full of the pockes.
For Physicians hold,
As I am told,
Such is our blood,
Either had or good,
In each degree,
As our aliments be:
Whereupon at this season,
Some make this reason,
Since our Cods, and our Cunger,
Have filled their hunger,
With the heads, and feet,
Of the Spanish Fleet,
Which to them were as sweet,
As a Goose to a Fox.
And seeing the pox,
Possessed each carcass,
From the slave to the Marquess.
No man can avoid,
But he may be anoide,
If he make them his meat,
Be they little or great:
Except by some correction,
Or wholesome confection,
And by art they be so used,
That they need not be refused.
Wherein the counsel,
Of those that can tell,
And in learning excel,
Would do very well.
But if you enquire,
Of Mass Priest, or Friar,
To hear what they will chatter
Concerning this matter,
They will answer anon,
And swear by Saint John,
That every one,
Of the Fleet that is gone,
Was holy and good,
Both in flesh and blood.
And therefore object,
That they could not infect,
Neither fish, nor seas,
With any disease.
But leave to the mire,
Both Priest, and Friar,
Or else to the sire,
For each is a liar.
And touching the question,
Know this that disgestion,
Wheresoever it be found,
In things that be sound,
Is of such operation,
That it makes separation,
Of the bad from the best,
And never does rest,
Until in the end,
It does clean away send,
That which does offend.
And what can be found,
Either simple or compound,
Than a fish more sound?
Then doubt not I pray you,
Let nothing dismay you,
Or trouble, or fray you,
If fish be well dressed,
And your stomachs not oppressed,
You need them not detest,
Howsoever they are fed,
Or wheresoever they are bred.
For both Frogs and Snailes,
And Mallards and Quayles,
Though on poison they feed,
And many a weed,
And dangerous seed,
Both to man and beast:
Yet since they them digest,
They do no man harm,
Be they cold or warm.
Wherefore as is said,
Be no more afraid,
On seafish to feed.
If them thou love or need.
But now I hear one say,
This question might stay,
As needless and vain,
Because it is plain,
That the Devil of hell,
Loved Spaniards so well,
That he carried them all,
Both great and small,
Either dead, or quick,
Through thin and thick,
Both body, and soul,
To his pinnefole,
As the place appointed,
For the Popes anointed.
FINIS.
Cum tua non fuerint heroica facta Philippe, Risu digna cano carmine ridiculo.
QVi regis Hispanos
Superbos, and vanos,
Crudeles, and insanos,
Multum aberrasti,
Cum tnos animasti,
Et bellum inchoasti
Contra Anglos animosos.
Fortes, and bellicosos,
Nobiles, and generosos,
Qui te excitavit,
Proculdubio deliravit,
Et te fascinavit.
Nam omnes sperabant,
Qui te amabant,
Ideoque iuuabant,
Multum te valere
Viribus and aere,
Hisque respondere
Animum generosum,
Caput tuum annosum,
Et pectus animosum.
Sed nunc cernentes,
Et conspicientes,
Licet dolentes,
Omnes tuas copias
Redactas ad inopias,
Migrasse ad Vtopias,
Stupent, and mirantur,
Plurimum vexantur,
Et pene exanimantur.
At Angli and Germani.
Qui sunt Antihispani,
Et omnes mente sani,
De tua ruina,
Qua paena divina,
Turbaris ad ima,
Valde laetantur,
Et exhilarantur,
Sibique gratulantur,
Quod stultitia detecta,
Vi tua reiecta,
Et re infecta,
Ignominiam nactus,
Es in fugam actus,
Et funditus fractus.
Post tantos clamores,
Sumptus, and labores,
Mundique terrores,
Sed vestros errores.
Non sapuisti,
Inquiunt isti,
Quando cecinisti,
Ante victoriam,
Falsam victoriam,
Et plane ingloriam:
Anglos superatos,
Prorsus subiugatos,
Et ad vnum enecatos,
Cum contra conspectis,
Hostibus, and detectis,
Animis deiectis,
Illico trepidantes,
Et minime ovantes,
Vt animas exhalantes,
Ob ignis horrorem,
Qui vobis pavorem,
Incussit, and timorem,
Fuga matura,
Per maria obscura,
Aspera and dura,
Vobis consuluistis,
Vt been novistis,
Probeque meministis,
Licet sine honor,
Non sine rubore,
Mundique stupore.
O Angliae eversores,
O praeclari victores,
O promeriti honores!
Sic saepe redite,
Quoties libet venite,
Et Anglos punite.
Sic operam impendite,
Sic agros divendite,
Et sic naves incendite.
Quis vnquam cogitasset,
Nisi ipsa confirmasset
Res, and probasset,
Patres tam acutos.
Subtiles, and astutos,
Calidos, and nasutos,
Vel prorsus neglexsisse,
Aut parum advertisse,
Aut non satis persensisse,
Argumentum a minore,
Quod suo summo cum honor,
Magnoque vestro cum dolor,
Draco vobis nectebat,
Cum vos vt decebat,
Pro meritis afsligebat,
Cum vobiscum disputabat,
Vrbes expugnabat,
Et singula vastabar.
Nam si ab vno Dracone,
Pusillo homuncione,
Tanquam a crabrone,
A vobis excitato,
Paucis stipato,
Et vix armato,
Ita estis icti,
Vexati, and afflicti,
Superati and victi.
Non erat sapientis,
Compotis mentis,
Aut dialecticam callentis,
Angliam oppugnare,
Et ridicule irritare,
Quae potest suppeditare,
Non paucos Dracones,
Plurimos scorpiones,
Et innumeros crabrones,
Quorum nullus recusabit,
Aut Hispanum declinabit,
Cum res ipsa postulabit:
Sed se virum vult praestare,
Tam per terram, quam per mare
Vbi licet provocare:
Licet Domini Inquisitores,
Evangelij osores,
Et patriae proditores,
Cum an tesignano
Suo Romano,
Et Antichristiano,
Ista ridebunt,
Pro fabulis tenebunt,
Et pro ioco habebunt,
Quia sunt elati,
Tumidi, and inflati,
Et prorsus excaecati.
Verum hoc lugete,
Vlulate and flete,
Trepidate, and timete,
Viuere virunculum,
Valere homunculum,
Et strenuum Dracunculum,
Quem Deus excita vit,
Ab vtero segregavit,
Et in hoc educavit,
Vt manum extendat,
Ecclesiam defendat,
Et vobis rependat
Sanguinem Sanctorum,
Nec non Indorum,
A vobis occisorum,
Et iam arma prendere,
Naves conscendere,
Et ad vos contendere.
Et sic o Rex valeto,
Mihique praebeto
Aures, and caveto,
A fundo, and lapillo,
Sagitta, and bacillo,
Draconis pusillo:
Ne te cogat plorare,
Palinodiam cantare,
Et turpiter exclamare,
Ob amissos honores,
Sumptus, and labores,
Et Indiae cultores,
O si sciuissem,
Aut saltem credidissem,
Me continuissem,
Nec Papam amassem,
Nec filium necassem,
Nec Deum irritassem:
Et tune te accusabunt,
Salse subsannabunt,
Et haereticum clamabunt,
Examina monstrorum,
Turba monachorum,
Fratrum, and sororum,
Et omnium Deorum
Deo exosorum,
Per omnia secula seculorum.
FINIS.
