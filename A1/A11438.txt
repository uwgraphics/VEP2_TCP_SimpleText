The Abridgemente of gods Statutes in myter, set out by Wylliam Samuel
servant to the Duke of Somerset his grace.

Imprinted at London by Robert Crowley for Robert Soughton dwelling at the
sign of ye bishops miter within Ludgate. Anno Domini. M. DL.I

To the most honorable and verteous Lady Anne, Duches of Somerset her Grace,
William Samuel her most humble and faithful servant, wishes the favor of
God, increase of honor, long life, and prosperous health, both of body and
soul.
WHen I consyderid with my self the lobours and pains that have bine taken of
diverse builders in Christ's church (my gracyous Lady and mistress) I thought my
self not borne into the earth, to be a loker on the bildinge, or to island
gapyng at other menes dylygence, but to put to my helpyng hand, for fear lest
yt I should be rewardyd among the Idel persons, or have that small talent taken
from me, that my master gave me, for not putting it to the change ba^ke. I
have now but begone, as it were the squaring out of a great stone and do offer
up unto your grace the beginning of my work, and If I shall perceive that my
simple doyngs, shall be well acceptid, of your grace (as the gross doing of
the same may be an occasion to ye contrary) then shall I gladlye go on or
proceed in my doing, at the least wise exersise, shall I doubt not but make
eueri part better tha^ ye other at their forth coming* My mind is that I would
have my country people able in a small some to sing the hole contents of the
bible, and where as in times past the musicians or mynstrells, were wont to sing
fained miracles, saints lives, and Robin hode, instead thereof to sing,
vndoutyd truths, canonycall scryptures, and Gods doings ^ have also begone the
same order that I intend to keep as where a book has thyrtye, forty, or
fythtye chapters, to deuyd it into fyttes, or parts, that it shall not be to
tedyous to the reader, synger, or hearer, to have the book in practys. Also
this my doyngs I trust shall cause the scrypturs, to be often read, as the man
yt hearyth a part of a story in ye scryptures, and does not know the hole:
this may move the hole to be red, And to those that be well seen in the holy
wrytyngs, this shall keep the^ in remembrance of those good things that they
have lernid The abrygement of Gods acts or statutes I do call it because it is
a su^me or short rehearsal of things done at large in the Bible book, which
may be called the king of al kings acts, desiring your grace to take it in
good worth and to accept my good will as I trust your grace will.

Genesis In G. Ex. L.N. and D. the.v. books of Moses contained be.
The first Chapter
Almighty God did make the heaven,
the Light the firmament:
The sun, the moon, the stars the beasts,
with fowls to fleeyng bent.
The earth the sea and al therein
all this his word did make
With man made last and yet set first
his will on them to take
The.ii. Chap
Begin did then the lord to rest
from making of such things
And poynted Adam to a place
a garden full of spryngs
One tree denied, and man does name
the beasts after his will
In sleep to him his make was made
which did his mind fullfyll
The ^iii, Chapt.
Caused was man by Satan's slight
gods will to burste out right
The he, the she, and the serpent
are curste and dreuen out quite
for fere lest man should then dyspayre
With his wyffe and to hell
the woman's sead y^ wyche was christ
Shall come and make al well
The.iiii. Chap
Down fell Abell Cain him slew
in offering to the Lord
The just was slain of the unjust
as scripture does record
The^ is he cursed and does dyspayre

The genealogy of Adams sons
and their sons does proceed.
The.v. Chap
Every year that Adam lived
is there full plainly told
Whose age was then.ix. hundred
And Just thyrty year old
and so from him unto just Noe
The chapter does exprese
the names and years how long they lyude
With much of their success
The.vi. Chapt
Full wicked were the people tho
a doude was threat of god
With a precept to make an ark
Even as the lord had bode
And then did Noe prepare the ship
after the lords deuyse
And ready pressed as he was wylld
against the floude should rise
The.vii. chap
God spoke these words to Noe his man
and we thereto must hark
Go thou and all thy family
with speed into the arc
Even so did Noe as god him bad
and took of each kind twain
His wife his son and al their wives
and then began the rain.
The viii Chapt
Honderyd days and ode fyfty
the floude began to end
A raven and eke a dove also
Noe forth for news did send
Then went Noe forth, and did offer
to God burnt sacrifice,
Which lyked well the God on hye
when the smell did arise.
The.ix. Chapter
In favor then was Noe and bleste
and murder is denied,
A rainbowe sent, and promise made
with water not destroyed.
Then Noe fell drunk, and lay vnhyld
and Ham his son was glad,
The other hylde him, and were bleste
but Ham his curssyng had.
The, x. Chapter,
Know ye may of Noe his sons,
as Sem, Ham, and Iapheth,
Chus Hams son, begat Nemrod
a hunter on the heath,
Of these three sons and their sons sons
the earth was stord again,
In to^ges and kinds with realms and lands
but most of them were vain.
The.xi. Chapter.
Lewdlye went this route to build
Babel that great hye tower,

Which went with Lot his fathers son,
and dwelled at Haran.
The xii Chapter.
Much favor God showed to Abra^
dwellinge in Canaan,

whose name hight then Pharao.
The xiii Chapter.
Neighbourlyke yode Lot and he,
and toward the south they went
Then parted they their land and good

The promise then to Abram is
repeted once again,
That he and his seed after him
the blessed land should obtain.
The.xiiii Chapter
Of foren kings Lot taken was
which ward and wan that land,
But then Abram did them destroy,
and took him from their hand.
Melchisedech with bread and wine
him met with mykel boste,
He gave him tenth, and paid the king
of Sodom all he lost.
The.xv. Chapter
Perform would God, the land he had
to Abram promised,
A son to have, he does believe
and so is justified,
How that his seed in bondage should
in Egypt there re name,
And be restord unto their land,
and so sent home again.
The xvi. Chapter
Quite barre^ Sara thought she was
and gave Abram her maid,
Which did conceive, and being proud
her mistres did vmbrayde,
Her mistres chode, and she togo
for faryng with her fell
An aungel her retournd again
and plyght her Ismaell.
The xvii Chapter
Remove did God the^ Abrams name
and called him Abraham,
And Sarai is named Sara
of whom tho Isaac came,
The sacrament is here begone
of Circumcision,
Isaac is plight, and Abraham
for Ismael does moan.
The, xviii, Chapter
So unto him three men apeard
like trauelers of miles,
Sara did hear that she should bear,
and womanlyke she smyles.

The, xix, Chapter
Two angels lodged, and Sodom me^

Blinded they were, and after stroyde

His wife to salt was turned tho
for breakyng gods precept,
His daughters he begat with child
when dronkelyke he had slepte.
The twenty Chap
When Abraham did flyt he dwelte
in the land of Gerar,
His wife being fair, he feared his life
and called her sister.
Abimeleck sent for her then
his pleasure for to have,
God him denied, then caused he her
much riches for to have,
The, xxi, Chapter
Almighty God sent Sara tho
Isaac her only son,
And Agar is put out at doors,
with Ismael her son,
An aungel did her comfort tho
being in wyldernes,
About a well Abimalech

The xxii. Chapter
Being then wylld to kill his son,
and he thereto was pressed
God told him then for his great faith

Nachor brother to Abraham

One of her sons was Bethuel
which was sire to Rebecca.
The.xxiii, Chapter
Commend to god did Sara then
her soul that was so mylde,
At her full years she fell on sleep
and dyed vndefylde,
The^ Abraham bought a plat of ground
of Ephron the Hethite,

when it was his by right.
The.xxiiii. Chapter
Decre did Abram to his man

which bare him chyldern more
He dyed and gave Isaacke his son
his good and all his store,
Then Isaacs wife, even at one birth

Thus have you hard of Genesis

Twentye and five in chapters paste
sith that the first begone
The xxvi, Chap
A Dearth then came in Isacks time
and so he did remove
That land was plyght to him

And shepherds strove about ye wells
but all was well again
The xxvii Chap
Begyld did Jacob Esau than
Rebecca wrought the feat
While Esau hontyd in the fylde
his brother gat the cheat
When Esau came from hontyng home
it vexyd him right sore
His father cherd him yet did he
his brother hate therefore,
The xxviii Chap
Commandyd Jacob sought a wife
and so to Laban went
Esau did wed an Ismaelyte
which unto evil was bent
As Jacob drempt he thought he saw
a ladder, angels dyght
Of Christ is told, a vow he made
unto the God of might
The xxix Chapt
Decre with Laban Jacob did
and served him seven year
Rahel to have it was his fee
but Lea did apeare,
And so beguiled, yet did he serve

The, xxx, Chapter
Each barre^, both they gave their maids
to their husband to wyue,
So had he children that they bare

The xxxi Chapt
Flytte from Laban god him bad
and so he did obaye,

And Laba^ chod, but peace was made
with Jacob on an hill.
The xxxii Chap
Goinge homeward towrds his land
to him angels apperde
Of Esau frayd, he sent him gifts
even hondryds on a herd
An angel and he strove so long
until it was day light
The angel changyd Jacobs name

The xxxiii Chap
Hastlye Esau set him out

And Jacob sent his herds before
and came after on fete
But when they met the greyd well
God so wrought then with them
In partyng plats they dwelte in two

The xxxiiii Chap
Jacob had but one daughter
that Dyna hight by name
She went to se and to be seen

He was destroyed by Jacob sons
and all the city quyght
The.xxxv. Chap

The.xxxviii. Chap

a woman of Canaan
He had three sons, two were destroyed

The xxxix. Chap.
O what hap then Joseph had
the lord did so provide
His masters wyffe did him provoke
but he her suit denyde
She him acusde, but not deserude
her tale as then took place
Whereby Joseph, to prison went
but gyltlesse in that case
The xl, Chap
Put in prison were Pharos men
and both of them laid fast
His baker chief, and butler both
whiles his anger did last
Joseph with them in prison was
and as they slept full sound,
They dreamed dreams, which Joseph the^
unto them did expound.
The.xli. Chapter
Question axte of Pharaos dream
of oxen fat and lean
Which Joseph did expound full plain
and told what they did mean
He was set up, and ruler made
in Egipte over all
He had two sons, and so the dearth
on Egypt then did fall.
The.xlii. Chap
Ride out for corn did Iosephes kyn
And came to him unknown,
He threat them hard yt they were spies
into that country blown,
Simion laid in prison is

Benjamin they took with them
which made their father morn.
The.xliii. Chap
So back they went to Egypt tho
with gifts and presents great
And Simion is delivered out,
and Joseph's chekes are wet.
Joseph could not chose but weep
when Benjamin he saw,
They sat and feasted in two parts
according to their law.
The.xliiii. Chapter
Then Joseph wrougt a pretty cast
Benjamin for to have,
And theft he laid unto his charge
he did him so behave,
Then Judah surety he becam
for Benjamin his sake,
His father Jacob he did know

The.xlv. Chapter
Unknowe^ was Joseph all this while
but then he told them all,
That he their brother Joseph was
that ruled great and small,
Then wylled he his brethern strayt
their father for to feache
In Egypt there to bide and dwell
as fare as it did streache
The xlvi Chapter
Apoyntyd forth then Israel went

And Joseph went with his two so^ns
To know his fathers mind
Jacob did will, that Joseph's sons
Ephraim and Manasses
Should be as children to him borne

The xlix Chap
Down fell his sons upon their knees
even twelve by number Just
He blessed them al, and told of things
to come that were dyscust
Then chargd he the^ yt they should lay
his bones in mamrey field
Then plucked he up his legs to him
and up the ghost he yield,
The l Chap
Each thing was don, his corpse they took
as he on live did mynge
And laid it down by abrams side
fulfyllyng so each thing
Forgive did Joseph all the fault
that his brethern had wrought
And so he dyed and wylld his bones

Here have ye now the end and some of Moses his first book, The second shall
in order come such pain the writer took.
The first Chapter
THe first Chapter of Exodus
the twelve tribes it does name
Which being dead and laid in earth
their children came to fame,
A new king than in Egypt came
that gave the Midwyues charge
To kyl ye males when they were born
but they set them at large.
The.ii. Chapter
Moses then was borne and cast
even down the river in reeds,
And Pharos daughter took him up
and showed him motherly deeds,
Then Moses slew an Egiptian
and fled, and took a wife
Then cried the people to the Lord
which saw their woeful life.
The, iii, Chapter
So Moses kept his fathers shype
not far from Oreb hill
Where in a bushe the Lord aperd
and told him all his will
And bade him go to Egypt bake
the Esraelyts to tell
That out of bondage they should come
and live and do full well
The iiii Chap
And Moses then receyuyd signs
of his calling by God
His reasons all they are assoyld
and forth the Lord him bode
And Aaron met with him in field
together then they went
Of Iethro Moses took his leave
and yed where he was sent
The v, Chap
Aaron* Moses, both they twain
told Pharo God his mind
The more the people were oppressed
the king was so unkind
Then cride they out and began to chyde
with Moses and Aaron
And Moses axed God the cause
which looked them upon.
The vi, Chap
He promised deliverance
unto the Israelites,
Also the land of Canaan
which made them chereful wyghts
Then Rubens spring with Simion
is told, and Leuito
Of whom came Moses and Aaron
that had gods hests to do
The vii Chap
The^ god made Moses Pharos god,
and Aaron his prophet,
And then god turned Moses rod
into a serpent great,
The Sorcerers did even the same
to harded Pharos heart,
The^ were the waters turned to blood
yet did he not convert
The.viii Chapter
The second plage that Pharo had
was frogs over the land
He sent for Moses and Aaron
to take the thing in hand,
He mocked them, therefore the lord
turned their dust to lisse,
And they put by, then came there flies
after the lords device,
The ix, Chap
The fyft plage was moren of beasts
that dyed in Pharos land,,
And syxtly sores with botches great
yet did he god wythstand
The seventh was hayle and thu^der much
that made the land to shake
And lightning great from heaven on hye
which causd them all to quake.
The x, Chap
Yet Pharos heart was hardenyd
and god he did resist
He did it not of ignorance
but well he knew and wyste,
The eight plage was grasshoppers
that god almighty sent
The ninth was darkness in the day
they knew not where they went.
The.xi. Chap
Comandyd were the Israelyts
the Egyptyans for to spoyll
Against they should depart and go
and give them all a foil
At midnight then the Lord did vow
to make so great a slaughter
The first borne of Egypt to kill
as it is told hereafter
The xii Chap
The passover with the sweet bread
commaundyd they did eat
And If there chyldern axe the cause
the meaning they must treat
The first borne then destroyed was
and robbed were the rest
And so the Ebrues took there way
even toward the land behest
The xiii Chap
The first borne of the Israelyts
the Lord did tak and choose
And commanded them an yearly feast
among them for to use
Then passyd they the wyldernes
with Joseph's bonnes also
Two pyllers for the day and night
they had thereby to go
The xiiii Chap
Pharo his heart was hardenyd
against the Israelyts
So follow did he with al his train
and came within their syghtes
But God his people did defend
by night and day from harm
The pass the sea but Egypt men
lay drowned in a swarm
The xv, Chap
When they were past this danger great
they sang a goodlye song
A woman came forth with diverse more
and daunsed all along
The bitter water was made swet
and pleasant for to drink
God must be hard in his covenant
and on him must we think
The xvi chap
So when the people were to months
within the wyldernes
Then wyshyd they again to be
in Egyp at their flesh
It rained quails from heaven on hie
and manna for there bred
And forty year in wyldernes
with that they were all fed
The.xvii. Chapter
Forth as they went, they lackid drink
and gruge then did the flock
At Moses suit then had they some
which came out of a rock
Out came a king hight Amelech
against them for to fight
Wha^ Moses hands were holden up
then were they put to flight
The.xviii. Chap
Iethro Moses father in law
came Moses for to se
Who welcomd him, his wife and sonns
after the best degree
When Iethro saw what pains he took
when Judgment he did use
Such actyue men as loud not coin
to help* he wylld him choose
The xix Chapt
Then as they went they came unto
the monte of Sinai
A royal people they are calde
if Gods will they apply
The Lord did say he that does touch
the hill shall dye out right
But Moses wylld went up to him
in thouder and great light
The xx, chapt
And god to Moses there did give
ten Just commandments
Precepts to keep and guide us by
with all their hole intents
An altar of earth then God did bid
his man Moses to make
And if of stone he did it buyld
no toll thereto to take
Twentye chapters before are told
in order as they stand
The rest hereafter ye may read
if ye will take in hand
The xxi chapter
THe second book of Moses then
even Exodus by name
Does tell good laws for maiestrats
to execute the same
That masters be not over sore
their saruants for to main
And he that kylls a man, is Judged
for it he must be slain
The xxii chapt
The^ forth again is told such laws
of theft the forth fold paid
He that defylles an vnplyght less
is wylld to mary the maid
A witch, and he, that knows, a beast
both dye they must ofright
All vsery it is forbode
and hatyd in Gods sight
The xxiii chap
These tow before and this the next
^one all of cyuile laws
Judges are wylld to take no gyfts
but here the pore man's cause,
Thou mast not follow a multitude
wyckydnes to commyte
Nor have to do with foreign Gods
though thou shulds dye for it
The xxiiii chap
The Lord co^mandyd Moses then
and all the head rulars
To worship him, y^ wyche does dwell
on hye above the stares
The law was told, and the hole rowte
with voice thereto obeyes
So Moses went up to the mount
and bode there fortye days
The.xxv, Chapt
Then God to Moses did dyscryb
the fashyon of his place
His labernacle how to build
in every point and case
He promised that in that house
with Moses he would treat
Between the cherubs in theree place
wyche was his mercy seat
The xxvi and xxvii Chapters
The six and twentye and the next
chapters of Exodus
Does still declare the form and shap
as God did it dyscus
How that his, holly place and house
wyche was his temple tho
Should be as he had it deuysde
whereby he might it know
The.xxviii. Chapter
Also to him god did descrybe
how Aaron should be cladde
Such garments might ye people tell
what office Aaron had
A breast lape and a tunicle
a strayte cote under that
With other things yt he must wear
whether he stood or sat
The xxix. chap
To Moses also god did show
how Aaron should be priested
With al his sons after what sort

And god to him did promise then
that he would be their God
And they should know he had the^ saude

The xxx, Chap
An alter also he must make
thereon to burn insence
Also on it to reconsyle
yearly for their offense
A brazen lauer he must make
to wash and make all clean
The anoyntyng oil with all the rest
more holyer things did mean
The xxxi Chap
Unto two men god gave the feate
to work the holy things
The saboth then, and day of rest
God unto Moses myngs
Tables twain the lord did give
to Moses on the hill
Wherein were writ the.x. precepts
which was the almyghtyes will
The xxxii. Chap
A golden calffe was made the while
the people were so vain
And Moses prayde to God for them
and burst the tables twain
When he came down he chod the pressed
and burnt the calfe in fire
Moses yernestlye prayed for them
yet some were paid their hyre
The xxxiii chapter
Commandyd were the people tho
that they should thense depart
But god denied to go with them
they were so froward in heart
And when the people herd thereof
they did lament in mind
Moses wylled to se Gods face
and saw him but behind
Th xxxiiii Chap
Two tabells then ar mad again
and God his mercy plyght
To cope with Gentells or there gods
it is forbidden quyght
The sweet bread feast with first begote

The xxxv Chap
So Moses told the people all
that is before expreste
To offer tithes and pay there fruits
each on of them was pressed
Bezaleel Ahal^ab
which wrought in sylke and says
The tabernacle they must make
and Moses does them prays
The xxxvi chap
These to before made many things
as God gave them the gift
Rings of gold and curtens thyke
to run all in a dryfte
The people brought such store of stuff
that there was over much
Willing they were, to buld gods house
and for to make it rich
The.xxxvii. Chapter
The ark was made of sethim wod
the mercy seat of gold
The tabels and the candelstyks
were made of the same molde
Lamps like cupes yt stood on them
to borne and to give light
The incense altar it was made
acordyng unto right
The xxxviii Chap
A another made for offeryngs
which should there on be burnt
A brazen lauer for to wash

The spard no cost to please the lord
so he their souls might have
The.xxxix. Chapter
Then Aaro^s garments they did make
apoyntyd for the nones
Of costlye gold and goodly sylke
all set with precious stones
So fynyshe then they did the work
as God to Moses wylld
And he it blessed and praysde it much
when he the work beheld
The ^xl. Chapt.
So last of all, almighty God
to Moses told his mind
How he should set the holy things
in their order and kind
The lord did compass with a cloud
the tabernacle quite,
The presens of the lord of hosts
was with it day and night
Thus Exodus is finyshed just forty chapters all Leuiticus comes next to it
which have likewise ye shall.
The first Chap
GOd almighty Moses told
within Leuiticus,
How he should offer sacrifice
the Lord did it discuss
Whether it were of beasts great
or else of cattle small.
Of turtle doves the manner how
they should be offered all.
The.ii. Chap
For meat offering, and for sweet cakes
the manner it to trym,
If leaven were put in thereto
then should it not like him,
Fine wheat flower, and frankincense
must go unto this feast,
Salt must season each sacrifice
whether it be foul or beast.
The ^iii. Chapt.
The order how the offering
for peace it should be used,
To make acord where strife was had
that hate might be refusde,
Of oxen, sheep, and lambs and gotes
atonement should be made,
Leuiticus the third Chapter
does show the form and trade,
The.iiii, Chapter
That priest that then committed sin
and done by ignorance
Should reconsile with sacrifice
confessyng his myschaunce
And if a lord did likewise so
offer he must likewise
The subject for the same offense
must offer sacrifice.
The v, Chapt
For such as swear and not performd
they must confess the deed
And offer a got or else a lamb
unless he be in need
The order how he should be clensde
that touchte an unclean thing
The Ignorante that synnyd then
an offering must bring
The.vi. Chapter.
Then he that stale or did dysceyue
his neighbors wyllyngly
Or found a thing and it denyde
five fold restore should he
The doars evil then offer should
for there offense and sin
An offering then is told full right
for Aaron and his kyne
The.vii. Chapter.
For trespase offering must be had
likewise for sin and peace
The bakte and broyld with fried flesh
is theirs that it does dress
The fat or blood may no man eat
it is denied plain

And ruled all the Israelites
in city and in field.
Of Moses books here is the last
as he did them all write,
Unto the lord give ye the praise
which is the god of might
