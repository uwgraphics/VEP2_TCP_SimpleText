DE ELOQVVTIONE.
ELoquutio, qua^ (...) Graeci dicunt, vnde and Eloquentiae nomen ortum esse
putant, omnium partiu^ vt pul^herrima, ita quoque vtilis sima, atqu^
difsicilima ^st, in qua oratoris vis illa diuina cernitur, qua^ cum Cicerone
optimo doctore, in partitionibus, copiose loquendi sapientiam definio, Nam et
ea profusae and immensaererum omnium inuentioni varietatem, plenitudinemque
addit: and certis dicendi luminibus, res in orationibus explicat, atque
exornat: and flumen grauissimis, sete^tits, et optimis verbis, propriis, apt
translatis, sonantibus, ad dice^di g^nus adducit. Nec solum ex flumine isto
eloquutionis eligere verba oportet, sed etiam collocare. Vis enim and facultas
orationis in simplicibus verbis, and coniunctis versatur, quarumilla inuemenda
sunt, haec collocanda. Est enim quidam ornatus, qui ex singulis verbis est:
alius qui ex coniunctis constat. Eligere autem and suo queque loco collocare,
de sententia Ciceronis, in oratore, and Fabij Quintiliani libro institutionum
oratorium octauo, nequaqua^ facile est. Sic. M. Antonius dicere solebat
disertos se vidisse multos, eloquentem adhue n^minim. Et M. ^ullius (vt ait
Fabius) inuentionem quidem and dispositionem prudentis hominis putauit,
eloquentiam vero oratoris. Ratio enim inueniendi, and collocandi, communis
omniu^ esse potest, qui vel antiquitatis clarissima monumenta in codicillos
referunt, atque historias literis memoriaeque mandant, vel, qui de aliqua re
loquuntur eloqui apt, destincte, ornateque dicere, ^modum paucis concessum
est. Sed quonia^ bipartita nobis eloquutionis est preceptio, primum dicemus
quas res omnis oratoria elocutio hab^re debet, que pars in sermon Latino atque
perspicuo, and comp^sitione, and dignitate posita est: deinde quibus in dicendi
generibus versatur. Eloqu^tio igitur commoda and perfecta, tres res in se
habere debet: Sermonem Latinum, and perspicuum, compositionem, dignitatem.

De Latino and perspicuo sermon.
DE his autem que in Eloquutione posuimus, hec sit prima cura, vt Latin and
perspicue ad rerum dignitatem a^que naturam loquamur, and verba efferamus ea,
que, (vt ait Cicero de oratore) nemo iure repre^endat. Latinus autem sermo and
prespicuus ex Grammaticis discitur, qui orationem puram and ab omni vitio
intermissam conseruat, and fa^it vt vnumquodque pure, and aperte, and dilucide
dici videatur. Constat autem Latinus sermo vsitatis verbis, quae in vsu
quotidiani sermonis versantur, and proprijs, quae eius rei sunt, de qua
loquetur. Nec vero proprietates ad nomen duntaxat, sed multo etiam magis ad vim
significationis referri, ac potestatem oportet: nec auditu, sed intellectu
perpendi. Ita translatio quoque, in qua fere maximus est Elo^utionis vsus,
verba non suis rebus accommodat. Sed tamen aliquando habet etiam in oratione
inusitatum aliquod verbum, aut poeticum, dignitatem, quibus, loco positis (vt
Ciceronis verbis vtar) grandior, atque antiquior or^tio sepe, vide^i solet.
Poetas enim o^nino quasi alia quadam li^gua loqui, nemo est qui ignoret. Vi tia
denique in sermon, quo minus is Latinus sit, Barbarismus.
duo enumetantur, Barbarismus, and Soloecismus, quoru^ ille, cum verbum aliquod
vitiose effertur, Soloecism^.
hic, cum verbis pluribus consequens verbum superiori non accomodatur, committi
solet.

A brief note of Eloquution the third part of Rhethorike.
Eloquution which the Greeks call Phrase, whereof also the name of Eloquence
does rise: as of all parts it is the goodliest, so is it also ye profitablest
and hardest, in which is seen that divine might and virtue of an orator,
which as Cicero in his oratorie partitions defines, is nothing ^ls but wisdom
spea king eloquently. For unto the maruaylous great invention of al things,
both it adds fulness and variety: it sets out and garnisheth with certain
lights of endighting the things that be spok^ of, and also with very grave
sentences, choice words, proper, aptly translated and well sou^ding, it
brings that great flood of eloquence, unto a certain kind of style. And out
of this great stream of Eloquution, not only must we choose apt and mete
words, but also take heed of placyng and setting them in order. For the might
and power of Eloquutio^, consists in words, considered by themselves, and
when they be joined together. Apt words by searchyng must be found out, and
after by diligence, conveniently coupled. For there is a garnishyng, eue^ when
they be pure and fine by themselves, and an other when they be joined
together. To chose them out fynely, and handsomely to bestow them in their
places, after the mind of Cicero and Quintilian, is no easy thing. So Marcus
Antonius was wont to say, that he had known many well spoken men, but none
eloquent. Tully and Quin tilian thought that invention and disposition, were the
parts of a witty and prudent man: but eloquence of an orator. For how to
fyude out matter and set it in order, may be common to al me^, which either
make abridgementes of the excellent works of ancient writers / and put
histories in remembrance, or that speak of any matter themselves: but to utter
the mind aptly, distinctly, and ornatelye, is a gift given to very ^ew. And
because we have divided Elo^uutio^ into two parts, that is, words ^imple, or
considered by themselfes, and compound, or joined together in speech, according
to this we say, that every elo quent oration must have in it. iii. points
evidence, which belongs to the first part of eloquution, composition, and
dignity, which belongs to the other.

Of Evidence and plains.
Of these things that we put in eloquutio^, let this be ye first care, to
speak evidently after the dignity and nature of the matter: and to utter
such words, which as Cicero says in his orator, no man may justly
reprehe^d. The plain and evident speech is learned of Grammarians, and it
keeps the oration pure, and without al fault: and makes that every thing may
seem to be spoken, pure ly, apertly, and clearly. Every speech stands by
usual words, that be in use of daily talk, and proper words that belong to
the thing, of which we shall speak. Neither be properties to be referred
only to the name of the thing, but much more to the strength and power of the
signification: and must be considred not by hearing, but by understanding. So
translation in the which commonly is the greatest use of eloquution, applirth
words, not to the self proper things. But yet an v^used word, or
^oeticall, has also sometime in the oration his dignity and being put in
place, (as ^icero says) often times may seem greater, and of more antiquity.
For that Poets do speak in manner as it were in an other tongue, it is right
sone perceived. Finally two fautes are committed in every language, whereby it
is not pure, Barbarism and Solecisme. Of the which that one is committed, when
any word is fautily spoken or writter, that other, when in many words joined
together, the word that follows is not well applied to that that goes
before.

De vitiis orationis.
OMnis oration bona and diserta, tres habere debet praecipuas virtutes. Vt sit
pura, dilucida, and ornata. His totidem opponuntur vitia. Barba^um, obscurum,
inornatum. Horum trium vitio sorum generum certae quaedam species sunt
collect^, quarum exempla subijciemus.

De Barbaro.
Barbarum vitium est, quando Barbaries quedam in orationem inducitur. Eius tres
sunt species.

Barbarismus. Barbaralexis. Soloecismus.
Barbarismus primum Eloquutionis vitium, est error in Orthographia, and
prosodia.

In Orthographia peccatur, quando in dictione aliqua, litera, vel Syllaba,
adijcitur detrahitur, immutatur, aut transponitur. Exemplum, cum de figuris
Grammaticis agemus, post oftendetur.

Error in prosodia est, cum contra recta^ vocum pronuntiationem, eam syllabam
que erat eleua^da deprimimus, vel contra, quae deprimenda erat, eleuamus. Id ne
fiat, diligenter a Grammaticis est prospectum: qui vnicuique syllabae suum
tonu^ quo vel eleuatur, vel deprimitur, vel circumflectitur assignarunt: primum
acutum, secundum grauem, tertium circumflexum appellantes.

Barbaralexis est, quum barbara, and peregrinae ^inguae vox Romano sermon
inseritur.

Soloecismus. Hoc vitiu^ ad figur as constructi^nis pertinet, and antea in
initio est definitum.

Barbaro opponitur Latinitas, quae coeostat regula, ^uthoritate, and
consuetudine. Latin loqui lex no^ est, sed obseruatio quedam excellentium
viroru^, cuius iud^ium pro ratione stat.

Faults of an Cration.
Every good and eloquent oration must have three principal virtues: that it be
pure, playu, and garnished. To these are there as many contrary vices.
Barbarous, dark, and ungarnished. Of which three general vices, there be
gathered certain kinds, whereof exaumples shall follow.

Of Barbarous.
Barbarous is a fault, when a certain vnpurenes is brought into the speech, and
it has three kinds.

Barbarism. Barbaralexis, Solecisme.
Barbarisine the first fault of Eloquution, is an error in true writing, and
true accenting.

We miss in true writing, when in any word a letter or syllable is put too,
taken away, changed, or transposed. Examples we will show afterward when we
speak of ye figures of Gra^mer.

The fault in accenting is, when contrary to the right pronunciation of
words, we put down that syllable which should be lift up: or contrary lift
up, which should be put down. And that we should not so do, the Grammarians
have made good provision, which to every syllable have assigued their acce^t,
whereby it is either lift up, put down, or strayned: calling the first an
accente acute, the second grave, the third circumflecte.

Barbaralexis, when a rude word or of a strange tongue is brought into the
Romain tongue. In the English speech there be so many, that some think we
speak little English or none at al.

Solecisme, this fault pertayneth to ye figures of construccion and is defined
^fore in the beginning.

Contrary to barbarous is pure latin, which stands by rule, authority, and
custom. For to speak latin is no law, but an obseruacion of excellent men^,
whose judgment stands for reason.

De obscuro.
OBscurum est cum vel verborum, vel structurae vitio, obscuritas quaedem
iuducitur. Eius ^ecies sunt.

Improprietas, Cum dictio minimae propriae significationis, orationi ceu nubes,
inducitur. Terentius. Nam quod tu speraspropulsabo facile, speras, pro times,
dixit.

Ambiguitas verbi, aut orationis, vt: Aio te Eacida Romanos vincere posse. Hic
vitio compositionis in ambiguo p^sita sententia. Nam vtri victoria promittatur
incertum.

Hyperbaton, Perplexa, and impedita constructio v^l iustolongior, Qualis
plerunque fit ab ineptis affectatorihus Periodorum.

Eclipsis, Quu^ necessaria dictio sententiae deest, ita vt perfectum sensum non
referat. Vt in epistolis ad Atticum permulta sunt.

Brachylogia, Quu^ de re graui nimis breuiter and anguste loquimur, quae and
longiore^, and aptiorem requirebat sermonem Est and orationis virtus, quu^
plura paucis complectimur.

Atque haesu^t ferme species obscuritatis, cui op ponitur secu^da virtus
orationis, perspicuitas, ce^sta^s proprietate, sensu, and compositione, Vt
docet Fabius in octauo libro. Cap. ij.

Of obscurity.
Obscurity is, when through the fault of words, or of setting them toge there,
a certain darkness is brought in, and has these kinds.

Impropertie, when a word is brought into the talk having nothing at al his
own proper signification: ^s when we say, you shall have six stripes which
you long for: when they long for the^ not one whit.

Ambiguitie, is of one word or of more, as, I say the Eacida the Romans may
overcome. Here through the fault of composicio^, it is in doubt to whom the
victory is promised.

An intricate construction, or longer than should be. Such as oftentimes
happeth to them that fondly labor to tell a good round tale.

Eclipsis is, when there lacks a necessary word in the sentence, so that it
is not full and perfect. Many of these are in Ciceros Epistles written to
Atticus

Brachylogia, when of a grave matter we speak too briefly, and that it
requi^ed a larger, and more mete treatise. It is also a virtue in speech, when
we comprehend many things in few words.

Contrary to obscurity, is playnesse, standing in propriety, sense, and compo
sition, as Fabius does she we in his ^yght book.

De Inornato.
INornatum est quum velordo, vel dignitas ver bis decst, Species sunt hae.

Pleonasmus, Hoc est, adiectio verbi superuacui ad plenam significationem. Vt
sic or^ loquuta est. Nonnunquam tamen asseuer ationis gratia adhibetur. Vt apud
Tere^t. Hisce oculis ego^et vidi, ^e nega.

Perittologia, verboru^ adiectio superuacua, sine vlla vi rerum. Est autem
Pleonasmo vitium affinc, nisi quod haec in sensu, Pleonasmus in ver^is
spectatur. Seneca, Habet inquit, hoc Montanus vitium. Sententias suas repetendo
corrum^u, dum non est contentus vnam rem semel been dicere efficit ne been
dixerit.

(...) Inutilis eiusde^ verbi, aut co^^ructionis iteratio, cu^ quid magno
fastidio sepius ingeminatur, id quod inexercitatis fere accidit, vt eandem
semper cantilenam canant.

Periergia, Quum in re^tenui multum verborum, and superuacanea^ operam
consumimus, ac nimium immoramur. Id quod copiam male affectantibus accidit.
Fabius superuacuam operositatem vocat. Huic opponitur expolitio, qua iam virtus
est, quum videlicet versamur sepe diuersis modis eadem, and in vna re, atque in
eadem sententia diutius commeramur.

Macrologia, quum aut tota oration, aut aliqua sententia fit iusto longior, vt
audientem fatiget^ Al^ orationem esse dicunt, res non necessa rias
complectentem. Fabius hoc exemplum ^ Liuio ponit, libro octauo. Iegati
no^impetrata pace retro domum vnde venerant, reuert^runt. Tere^tius. Mea est
sic ratio, and sic animum induco meum. Sunt qui Macrologiam orationem esse
velint nimis cultam, aut l^nga descriptione productam sententiam. Mihi non
absimile vitium esse periergiae videtur. Huic vicina Periphrasis, virtus
habetur.

(...), Cum rei magnitudo, vel dignitas, verbi humilitate deprimitur.

(...) Cognatum superiori vitio, nisi quod pluribus verbis fit, vbi de re
magna, and ardu^ iusto tenuior, and simplicior oration, quam ^es ea ferat.

(...) Miosi contraria, quum ^es tenues ac leuiculae, quadam efferuntur ni^s
tumida, and magnifica oratione. Qualem ^omici pro decoro personae militibus
gloriosis, and ^arasitis tribuunt.

Asiatismus, hoc est Asianum genus orationis, ^mmodicum, ac redundans verbis et
figuris, sed ^ebusinane.

(...) Quum vitio compositi^nis inuerecunda est oration.

Cacemphaton, id est absurditas, vel absonum ^uum duriter and deformiter inter
se coherent li^ere vel syllabae. Vt, iuuat ire and dorica castra. Et ^eca
caligine soles^ Tale est, O tite, tute tati. Fa^ius Cacephaton esse ait, cum
aut mala consue^udine in obscoenum intell^ctum est sermo detor^ ^us, aut
iunctura deformiter sonat.

(...). Hoc est praua and peruers^ affectatio, vt si quis eam orationem
affectet, cui non sit par. Breuiter quoties ingenium iuditio caret, and specie
boni fallitur. Vt recte quidam Cacozeliam esse dixerunt, per affectatim^
decoris corruptam sententiam, quum eo ipso dedecoretur oration, quo illam voluit
author ornar Hec fit aut nimio tumore, aut nimio cultu.

(...) Quu^ oration omni ornatu ve^ boru^, et figurarum caret, vel contra, cum
est inep^ figurata. Nam in vitium ducit culpe fuga si ca^ ret art.

(...) Vbi nihil est in oratione vary tatis, aut suauitatis. hoc est, quum est
vni for mis, et vbique sui similis oration, and que nulla va rietate leuet
taedium. Estque hoc vitium, and supe^ riori finitimum, and sequenti contrarium.

(...) Vbi nihilest i^ oratione rectu^ ^ut propriu^, sed omnia i^modice
figurata, et nimi picturata Qualis est ferme sermo Apulaia^s

(...) Commistio inepta sermonis variis linguis and idiomati^us consuta.

Item, si quis poeticas figuras ora^ni solutae admisciat.

(...) Tractum genus dicendi, and oration prorsus carens numeris, and
compositione tolerabili.

(...) Inco^positum, seu male collocatum, hoc est, vbi verba male congeruntur,
penisque coherent, alioqui bona si in loco poner entur, vel Cacosyntheton est
indece^s structur a ver^borum, et compositio vitiosa.

(...) Male dispositum, and indistinctum, affine superiori vitium, quum nulla
est in oratione oeconomia, sed omnia confusa sursum ^eorsumque miscentur. Atque
haec sunt breuiter descripta orationis vitia.

Of ungarnished.
Ungarnished is, when either there lacks order, or beautifying in the words.
The kinds be these.

Pleonasmus, the putting too of a superfluous word, to a full significacion:
as, So she spoke with her mouth. Sometime it is used for asseueracion, as, I
saw it with these eyes of mine: deny it not.

Perittologia, a superfluous addyng of words, without any pythe of matter. It
is like fault to Pleonasmus, ^aue that the one stands in sense, the other is
seen in words. Seneca. Mo^tanus has this fault, that he marreth all by to
much repetyng of sentences, and while he is not content to have spoken a thing
once, he makes all naught.

Tautologia, an unprofitable rehear^all of all one word, or construccioi^.
when with great yrcksomnes we double the matter, which commonly they are wont
to do that be not exercised, but therefore sing all one song.

Periergia, when in a small matter we spend many words, and labor much in
vain, and tarry to long in it. Which thing happeth to them yt lewdly seek for
copy. Fabius calls it, vain curiositi^. ^ontrary to this, is Expo^icion,
which is a virtue, when in deed we stand in one thing and sentence, turuyng the
same diverse wai^s.

Macrologia, when either the whole oration, or some sentence thereof, is longer
then it should be, and weryeth the hearer, Fabius takes this example out of
^iuie, in the eight book. The ^egates (peace not being obtained) did return
home again from whence their came. Terence. This is my reason, and thus I
think in my mind. There be that call it Macrologia, when the oration is to
trim, and set out at length with some godly description. Me thinks it is much
like Periergia. Periphrasis^ which draws uye to this, is counted a virtue.

Tapinosis, when a w^ightie and high matter is brought down by bas^s of a
word: as if you would say to a king, And it please your Mastership.

Bomphiologia, contrary to Miosis, is when light and ^sting matters, are set
out with gaye and blasing words. Such as in ^ommedies are wont to be spoken,
of crakyng soldiers, and smell feasts.

Asiatismus, a kind of endighting used of the Asians, full of figures, and
words, lackyng matter.

A^schrologia, when through the fault of ioynyng words together, some
uncleanly meaning may be gathered.

^acemphaton, when letters and syllables hang evil fauouredly together: as if
there be to many of this letter, r, or of t, which causes a rough^es, or
stamme ring.

^ozelia, a peuishe desire to follow such a kind of writing as thou art not
inete for: defacyng the thing which thou would fayuest beauti^ie.

Asch^maton, when in the oration there is no variety, nor pleasauntnes, but it
is all alike, and by no variety takes away tediousnes, a fault like to that
y^ goes before, and contrary to this that follows.

(...) When in the oration the^ is nothing rightly and properly spoken, but all
is to much befigured and begayed. Such is the writing of Apuleius

(...) A foolish mingling together of words out of diverse langua ges. Also if
a man in prose would use figures poetical.

(...) A kind of endighting draw out a long, utterly void of all sweet and
round composicion.

Cacosyntheton, when the words be evil heaped together, and be worse joined:
being good if they were set in place.

(...) A fault somewhat like the other: when there is no good disposicion of
the words, but all are confused up and down, and set without order.

De figuris Grammaticis Orthographicis.
APud Grammaticos, figurarum duo sunt genera: alterum singuloru^ verboru^,
alteru^ constructorum. Priores figurae a Grecis (...) nominantur, quia verba,
transformant. In prosa, his vti non licet, si barbarismi reprehensionem volumus
effugere. A poetis meter causa vsurpantur. In oratione soluta nihil impedit quo
minus verba, acsyllabas integre pronunciemus, and scribamus: quod quia versibus
no^ fit, orthographicae etiam vocantur, quasi orthographiam vitiantes. Et si
autem Latinis, sed Grecis maxim in componendis versibus celebrantur, tamen
nostris quoque poetis non sunt infrequentes si quis eorum poemata cu^ratione
perlegerit. Se^ nunc ad figuras.

Defiguris orthographicis.
FIgura Orthographica est, cum a vulgariratione scribendi, aut loquendi, metri
causa deflectimus. Eius species sunt.

Prosthesis. Cum dictioms initio, litera, syllabaue additur. vt. Virg. Oscula
libauit gnatae dehinc talia fatur gnatae pro natae. Terentius. Pol ^oc si
scissem: nu^quam huc tetulissem pedem, pro, tulissem.

Epenthesis cum medio.

Iuuenal. Rara auis in terris nigroque similli ma cigno pro, similima. Virgil.
Romanus Gra iusque and Barbarus induperator. pro, imperator

Paragoge, cum aliquid fini additur.

Persius. At pulcbrum est digito monstrari, ^ dicier hic est. pro dici.

His totidem contraria sunt, vbi aliquid deest.

Apheresis. Cum principio dictionis aliquid adimitur. Virgil. Babit ille ruinas,

Arboribus, stragemque sans: ruet omnia la te ru^t, procruet. Horat. Et cetera
ludicra pono pro depono.

Sincope, cum aliquid in medio deest. Virgil Sufstulit, exutas vinclis ad
sydera palmas. pro vi^culis, Idem. C^ngite fronde comas, and pocula por gite
dextris pro, porrigite.

Apocope, Cum a fine aliquid adimitur. O (...). Adfuit and certis tempora
vinctus Hyme^ pro Hymeneus.

Metathesis, transpositio quaedam literarum Virg. Nam tibi timbre caput
Euandrius abst^lit ensis. pro timber.

Antisthecon. Literae pro litera positio. Virgiliu^ Olli subridens hominum
sator atque deoru^ Olli, pro, illi.

(...)

Sequuntur schemata prosodica, que in ver suum dimensione adhiberi solent.

Diaeresis, vnius syllabae, hoc est, diphthongi in duas syllabas diductio.
Virg. Dives equum, dives, pictai vestis and auri.

Syneresis. Duarum syllabarum in vnam co^prehensio. Ovid. Notus amor Phaedra,
nota est iniuria Thesei. Vbi. E. i. sonandum tanquam. i.

Hae due figurae in versuum scantione adhiberi solent.

Diastole, Syllabae breuis, aut ancipitis productio. Virg. Exercet Diana
choros. Diana prima producta dixit, quum sit alioqui breuis.

Systole, Cum longam syllabam corripimus. Virg. Connubio iungam stabili
propriamque di cabo. Hic. nu. corripitur, quum tamen sit longae. Et hae due
figurae ad syllabarum quantitatem pertinent.

THe like unto these figures gen tell reader, undoubtedly be found in our
Poets, where for the Meter sake, they oftentimes be feign, to add, to
change, to dyminyshe Letters, and Syllables, from the true writing and reading
of the In this verse, where is that false cruel tirant Nerown.
word: as Chaucer sometime calls him Nerown, whose name in deed is Nero:
and that to make the Meter agree with the staff that went before, and so
adds a syllable in the latter end of the word, as do the Latins, when
they say Dicier for dici. And as here is added somewhat to the end: so in
this verse, In wintars just return when Boreas began his raygne: is taken away
a syllable from the begyunyng, (began) being put for began: but so if he should
have said, than had the verse been to long by a syllable, although in deed
the word should so have been truly written. Now because I am not well seen
in English Meters my self, therefore I could not, I confess, well exemplifye
in English all these foresaid figures in Latin. Uirgil said well. Non omnia
possumus omnes. Whosoever can do it, is worthy praise, and worthy more praise if he
will do it. But to say somewhat of these figures: whosoever thinks them
lightly to be passed over, judges over lightly. For truly it is not enough in
expou^ding Latin Poets, to say, here figure: except he tell him also it is a
fault. But because of the Meter, instead of fault it is called a figure. And
the like is not to be used in prose, when there is no necessity why we should
not both write out the word at length and also pronounce it as it is written.
Who will say, and say truly, porge dextram, for, porrige dex^eram: and yet so
says Uirgill before alleged, in the figure Sincope. And so of the rest. Thus
much I think sufficient to have noted touching this matter.

De figuris constructionis.
FIgurarum Grammaticarum partem alteram in verbis coniunctis positam esse
diximus, quae Syntaxis Grecis dicitur. Ea est ratio coniungendorum verborum,
secu^dum artis regulas, vt perfecta inde conficiatur oration. De eo, Grammatici
plurima dederunt precepta. A duersus quae, vitium qui commit^t, in Soloec^smum
incidit. Verum quia non temere, s^d certis de causis, eximij authors, a
regulis illis declinant, pr^ ^tio figura est appellata.

Figura constructionis quid.
Est itaque figura Constructionis, cum a communi ratione loquendi, breuitatis,
aut alicuius commoditatis gratia, non nihil deflectimus. Eius species sunt.

Eclypsis, cum ad legitimam constructionem, dictio necessaria deest, quae tamen
vel consuetudine authorum subaudiri solet, vel quia ex ceteris verbis
precedentibus est certa, vt.

Of Grammatical figures we said (...) other to be put in words, wha^ they
(...) joined together, which in Greek is (...) construction. That is, a manner
(...) way to set them together after the (...) of the Art, that of them may
be (...) a perfect and full oration. Of (...) the Grammarians have given (...)
precepts. The fault thereof in general word is called Incongruite. But
because this is openly used of (...) authors, not at al adue^tures, (...) for
certain causes, instead of fault it is called a figure.

Of the figure of Construction.
So then the figure of Construction is, when we somewhat turn away from the
common and vulgar manner of speaking, because of briefues or some co^ moditie.
The kinds be these.

Eclypsis, when to the just Construction a necessary word lacks, which
yet is wont to be understand either by the custom of authors, or because it
is certain by other words that go before: as.

After we were come to Paul's. Church.

Why went you not straighte in? Way.

Dated the fyrit of January, Letters.

He pitched in the valley. His tent.

He is sick of a quariane. F^uer.

He is good to none but to his own. Fre^des or servants.

Since that he ceased not to lie in wai^ for his brother. Time.

There be that will ouerrunne you. Men.

Enough of this Is spoken.

In all which must be understand the words put in the margent.

Aposiopesis is, when any thing lacks to the perfect^es of speech, either
for some affection, or for p^ssing to an other thing, yt stands us more upon.

For affecc^on thus. Often have I war ned thee of this faul^e, but except tho^
beware. Here the sentence is cut of for anger.

I know when, and in what place thouhere is a stop, through shame. And thou
also, if thou remember. But I say no more. Here for passing to an other matter,
we break of the tale.

Zeugma is, when in like clauses, some common word or thing, put in one
clawse, and not changed in the other, is yet left out, and understand, and
that many ways.

That that is taken away, either is ye verb it self, or somewhat that goes
before the verb, or somewhat that follows. The verb thus.

Not the place honesteth the manne, but the manne the place. In the second
clawse is left out (honesteth.) That goes before the verb thus.

A good man loves not only his fre^des present, but makes much also of his
friends absent. Here must be supplied this word (good man.) That follows the
verb thus,

As a good man defends friends absent, so an evil man forsakes: vnder^tande
(friends.)

Zeugma is varyed also by the place, where that common word is put.

For if it be set in the foreclawse, it is called. Prozeugma. If in the myddle,
Mesozeugma. In the last. Hipozeugma in this wise.

Lechery over came chastity, boldness, fear, madness, reason.

Beauty, by age decays, and by sickness

Beauty by sickness, by sorrow, or (...) age decays.

Diazeugma, when of those things (...) which we speak, either both, or each
on^ of them is concluded, with their certain verb, thus: The people of Rome de
stroyed Numa^c^, over threw Carthage cast down Corinthe, and raced Fregels
Also, coue^ousnes hurts the body, corrupts the mind.

Prolepsis, when the general word^ going before, is divided into parts where
must be understand a coniunc^ tion copulative, as.

Aegles flee, one from the East, anothe from the west: for, and the one flies
from the East, and the other from the West

They took prisoners, partly hole, (...) ly wounded: for, and partlye they
(...) hole, and partlye they took wounded Merueylouslye serve these figures
(...) brevity both in speaking and writing

Contrary to these, is that kind (...) stands in excess, called generallye,
Pleonasmos, That happeth, when one, or many words, not necessary to the ^ust
and lawful construction, doo^ abound thus.

I saw it with mine eyes.
He spoke, it with his mouth.
I wot not in ye world where to find hi
Epanalepsis, when after some things put between, we repete again that we set
in the beginning, the constructio^ nevertheless being perfect without it. And
we repete it again either with the same words, or other yt be of like value or
else more general. With the same thus

Think not Brutus, how be it I have no need to write these thiges unto the,
that thou know well enough I think not, I say, any man like unto him, in ver
tue, constaunce and diligence. With other words that be of like value thus.

This thing confyrmed, of which if the Philosophers say true, we cannot
doubt, when in death there is no such utter undoing, that not yt lest
suspicio^ of sense may remain: this then I say well assured, we must discuss
this, what it is to lack sorrow. with more gen^ral thus

But to overcome thy mind, to restrain thine anger, to temper the victory.
Him that does these things, I do not compare to the noblest men, but judge
most like unto god.

De Hyperbato.
Now remain those figures, which trouble the Grammatical order: and there
fore as to ye chief are under this Greek word, Hyperbaton, which is as much
to sa^e, of words and construction a troubled order. His kinds be these.

Anastrophe, a preposterous orderyng or setting of words, as: The sea flows
all England about. Long when they had fought.

Hysterologia when the preposicion is not put unto the nowne where unto it
serves, but to the verb, as though it were compound with it, thus.

He slydby with his wheles the uppermost of the water: where by is joined to the
verb that properly belonges to the nowne, thus: He slydde with his wheles by
the over part of the water.

Hysteron proteron differs from the figure before, because there is but trans
posicio^ of the words: and here is a transposicion of things: that is, when
that in the order of speaking is set in ye first place, that was not first
done, but second. Uirgil. Phoebus lyghtned the earth with his golge^ Lamp, and
drove away the moist shadow from the Pole.

Here is set in the second place, that which was first done. For night was
drieuen away before the Sun gave light upon the earth.

Tmesis is, when a compou^d word being divided, some other word is put between
ye parts, thus. What things so uer pleased him to do, he did. Here (thin
ges) divides this one word, whatsoever

Interpositio, a sense cast betwixt the speech, before the talk be al ended:
which though it give some strength, yet when it is taken away, it leaves the
sentence perfect enough. Other that be of this sort (they be so many) are able
to weary babbling Fabius.

De Tropis.

De Tropis orationis.
TRopus orationis est, quum non vnius tantum verbi, sed omnium in constructione

Of Tropes.
Because the knowledge of Trop^ is very necessary for children, and t^ teaching
of them joined with those f^ gures, of which hitherto we have ta^ ked:
therefore we will brieflye shew^ expound, and divide them. For a^ entrance to
Rhethorike, by them (...) made open to such as be studious of (...) loquence.
So that the Grammari^ here seems to end his art, and Rhe^ rician to begin, and
as it were to lay hi^ foundation. A trope the^ is a bowing o^ a word or speech
from his own sig^ nification into another. And is in tw^ sorts, of a word,
and of oration.

The Trope of a word.
The trope of a word is a figure be^ ryng the word from his proper a^ vulgar
signification, to an other tha^ is not proper, either for pleasautnes o^
necessity. Whose kinds be these.

Metaphora, when a word is translate^ of his proper place i^to another, when
either there lacks a proper word, (...) the word translated is better, and
of ^ore signification, and may well be so done (...) a similitude. And that
many ways.

First from the senses of the body to, ^e mind: as, from the sight. Terence.

Look upon your old age, for have regard ^ From the hearing. Terence. Whe^er I
should leave my master, or her^en to the old man, for obey.

From smelling, does my father smell ^ut any thing? for suspect any thing.

From tasting. Cicero. Swallow up ^he pain of a few days, for think ye ^ele
it not.

From the reasonable to the unreasonable, as. When we apply the deed, or
affeccion of man to any beast: and many such be in virgil in Georgikes
touching Bees.

From the unreasonable to the reasonable, as. Cato, was wont to bark at
Scipio, for, to chide with him.

From the living, to the living: as if you will say, that an Ape rydeth on
^orsebacke.

From the living to the not (...) ^s now all the fields laughe.

From the not living to the living.

Sometime in a b^rbe there is tran^ ^acion. as, time ^yeth away.

Catachresis is a necessary abuse (...) like words, for the proper: as, when
w^ call him a manqueller, which ha^h kyl led any person, man or woman, mother
o^ wife. This (...) differs from Metapho ra, because abus^ is where there
lacked a word: translation were an other was.

Metonymia, when in things that be syb together, one name is changed for an
other, as.

The finder for the thing that is found Terence. Without Ceres and ^acchus
Uenus is cold: where Ceres is put for meat, Bacchus for wy^e, and Uenus for
Lechery.

The possessor for the thig yt is possessed: as, have here this man to be
eaten up for his goods.

The author for the ^orke: Cicero, must always be had in out hands: for, the
works of Cicero.

The captain for the host. Hannibal at Cannas killed. lx. thousand men: for,
the host of Hanniball.

The co^teiner for that that is contained, Italy cannot be overcome by war,
nor Greece by learning: for, the men that ^well there.

The sign for that that is signified, as Let weapons give place to the gown,
and the Laurel to the tongue.

This trope differs from Metaphora: because Metaphora chau^geth a word of her
own with another, though the things be very diverse: but here as ye thiges must
be very nigh, so must the words also be

Metalepsis, when a word that is dew to the cause is ascribed to the effect.

Synecdoche, when one thing is understand by an other, or we understand more
then we speak, as.

Of one many. The Carthaginian holp the spanyardes. for, the Carthaginians.

By the part the whole. O thou folish head, for foolish man.

By the kind the general. as, If thou see thine enemies Alse, fall under hy^
burden, for cattle.

By the matter, the thing yt is made of (...) as flesh and blood did not show
thee this. Flesh and blood, is put for man made of flesh and blood.

By that that goes before, the thing that follows. As he unloosed her virgins
gyrdle. For he had her virginity.

By that that follows the thing that goes before: as, in the swet of thy
face, thou shall eat thy bread. For with labor.

Antonomasia, when for the proper name, some other external is put, either of
study, art, office, or dignity, as.

Philosopher. for Aristotle. Poet. for Uirgil. Savior. for Jesus. Apostle. for
Paul.
Or contrary, proper names, for appellatiues, as.

Socrates. for Wiseman. Thraso. for Boaster.
Also the name of nation for the properties attributed to the nation, as.

A Cretian. for (...). A Scithian. for Cruel. A Sybaritie. for Riotous, A
carthaginian. for League breaker.
Periphrasis is, when that, that may be spoken with one word, is declared in
many, and that three manner ways.

By explicacion of the name: as when for this word Philosopher, we say: a man
studious of wisdom.

By diffinicion of the thing, as for Logike, the art of reasoning.

By notacion, that is, when by certain marks, and signs we do describe any
thing: as, if a man understanding anger, will say it is the boylyng of the
mind, which brings palenes unto the countenance, burning to the iyes,
tre^bling to the parts of the body.

Also, when for the proper name we put the country, the sect, or some great
act: as.

For Uirgil, the Poet of Mantua.

For Aristotle, the prince of peripateti^all schole.

For Scipio, the destroyer of Carthage and Numance.

Periphrasis is, to hide things the be foul: as when we say, I will go (...)
the privy, for.

I will make water, for

And to garnish things y^ be good^ and to make that that is short, good^ and
long, as does Erasmus upon t^ gospels and pistles.

It differs from Antonomasia, b^ cause there, but one word is (...) with
another, here one word is decl^ red with many.

Tropes of Oration.
Trope of Oration is, when the sy^ nification, not of one word only, but (...)
all that be in the construction be chau^ ged. The kinds be these.

Allegoria, which is an oration, she^ ing one thing in words, and another
(...) sense. Horace. O ship, shall new floud^ ^arye thee again into the sea?

O what do thou? take ye haue^ lustil^ Where ship is put for the common welt^
floudes for civil battle: haven for pea^ and concord. He has these kinds.

Enigma, which is an oracion, out o^ ^hiche for the darkness, there can be no
^ertaintie gathered: as. My mother be^at me, and of me anon is begotten again:
^ent of ice frore^ of water, and resolved ^gayne into the same. Also the half
is ^ore then the whole. By which is com^ended mediocritie.

Paroemia, a saying much used, and no^able for some noueltye: as. I hold ^he
woulfe by the ears. Also the woulf ^s in our tale.

Ironia, dissimulacion, not so much ^erceiued by the words, as either by
^ronunciation, or by the behauior of the ^erso^, or nature of the thing. His
kinds ^e these.

Sarcasmus, a scorn of our enemy, and a ^ipping taunt. As the Jews said ^o
Christ: now let him come down from ^he cross, and save himself, that saved
other.

Astysmus, when a thing is po^ished with some merry conceit, as Uirgil speaking
of two foolish Poets, Mauius and Bauius said: He that hates not Bauius,
let him love the verses, O Meui, join foxes, and mylk^ he goats.

Myetirismus, a counterfayted laug^ ter, but yet such one as may be perceived.
Persius. I care not, to be as Artesilas is.

Charientismus, when things that (...) hardely spoken, be mollifyed with
pleasant words. Terence. Sir I pray^ you be good master to me, quod Dauus^
when yet he desired Simo, that he mig^ not be thrust into the bakehouse.

De Schematibus se^ Figuris.
FIgurae sieve Schema, est art aliqua nouata dice^di forma, vt i^quit Fabius.
vel, co^formatio qudam orationis, remota a communi, and prim^ se offerente
dicendi ratione.

Figura duplex est, aut sententiarum, aut ver^ borum. Saepe coeunt hae figurae,
velut in illo Cic^ ronis: Iam iam Dolabella neque tui me, neq^ tuorum liberum,
and quae sequuntur. Na^ oration a iudice auersa in sententia, iam iam, and
^berum, in verbis funt Schemata, hoc est, Apo^ropha, sententiae figura. in, iam
iam, Epizeuxis, (...) liberum, Syncopa, verborum figurae sunt. Est ^utem hoc
inter figuras discrimen, quod ver^orum Schema tollitur, si verba mutaris,
senten^arum permanet, quibuscunque verbis vti ve^s.

De figuris verborum.
^Igura verborum est duplex, aut enim verbi significatio mutatur, and dicitur
Tropus, de ^uo superius a nobis dictum. aut verbi signifi^tio manet, idque vel
in singulis vocibus, de ^uo ipso quoque dictum est: aut in coniunctis, ^uam
orationem dicimus, de hac figura iam age ^us. Est igitur hoc locofigura
verborum, quu^ ^do situsque verboru^, figuratur, and mutatur, ac ^onnihil a
vulgata constructione variat. Huiu^ ^ecies sunt.

Of Schemes of figures.
Figure or Scheme, is a facion of in^ighting made new, by some craft, as
^yeth Fabius. Or a facioning of many ^ordes removed from the common ma^er of
speaking, as it comes out at ^e first.

There be two sorts of figures: of se^te^^s, and words. These often cum
together As in this saying of Cicero, Now no^ Dolebella, neither do I force of
thee^ nor thy children. For the oration turue^ from the judge, is in sentence,
now no^ and liberum, be Schemes in words: I^ iam iam is Epizeuxis, in
liberum, Syncopa. An^ they be figures of words. And this is (...) difference
between these figures, tha^ the Schemes of words be taken awa^ if thou change
the words: but they o^ sentences remain use what words tho^ will,

Of the figures of words.
The figure of words is of. ii. sorts For either the significacio^ of the word
i^ changed, and is called a trope, of ye which we have spoken before: Or the
sigu^ ficacio^ of the word reinayneth, and tha iu echeword alone, of the which
also (...) have spoken: or in words ioygned to gether, which we call talk, or
Oration Of this figure we will now speak So in this place the figure of word
is, when the order and setting (...) words is changed, and varieth some what
from the common setting of the^ together. And hereof these be the ^yudes.

Repetitio est, cum continenter ab vno atque eo^em verbo primcipia sumimus, hoc
pacto. Tibi ^tud attribuitur: Tibi habendae gratiae: I ibi ista ^es erit
honori. Venusta and acris figura.

Repeticion is, when we take o^r be^innynges still at one, and the self ^ame
word, thus. To thee this thing ^s ascribed: To thee thanks are to be ^euen:
To thee it shall be great ho^oure. This is a pleasant and sharp ^gure.

Conuersio, quae non ab vno atque eodem verbo ^incipia sumit, sed eodem modo
continenter o^ationem claudit: est que superiori contraria: vt, ^x quo tempore
concordia de ciuitate sublata est, ^des sublata est, amicitia sublata est.

Conversion is, which takes not his ^eginning at one, and the selfsame word,
^ut with all one word still closes up ^he sentence, and it is contrary to
that ^ther before: as. Since the time that con^rde was taken away from the
city, liberty was taken away, fidelity (...) taken away, friendship was taken
(...)

Complexio vtramque complectitur exornati^ nem: and hanc, and quam ante
exposuimus: vt (...) repetatur idem verbu^saepius, and crebro ad (...)
postremum reuertamur: vt, Qui sunt qui faede^ (...) ruperunt? Carthaginenses.
Qui sunt qui (...) dele bellum in Italia gesserunt? Carthaginense^ Qui sunt qui
Italiam deformauerunt? Carthag^ nenses.

(...), co^priseth both two exorn^ ^ions, both this, and that we declare^
before, that both one first (...) should be often repeted, and that (...)
should turn often to alone last word: (...) who were they that often (...)
they Leagues? The Carthaginians. (...) made cruel war in Italy? The ^ar
thaginians. Who defaced all Italie^ The Carthaginians.

Anadiplosis, est finis versus, in principio alte^ rius, repetitio, velquum
prioris sententie (...) vltimum, ac insequentis primu^ est idem, vt, (...) tur
pulcheri^ Astur, Astur equo fidens, (...) and oratores quoque hac figura
vtu^tur, Cic. Hic (...) men viuit, viuit? imo etiam in senatum venit.

Anadiplosis is, when the last word of a verse is repeted in the beginning of
ye next verse, as in this verse of (...) gil. Then followed fair Astur, Astur
bold on horseback. The orators also use this figure. Cicero. And yet he
lives. Lives? yea comes into the cou^ sell house.

Conduplicatio est, cum ratione amplificationis, aut commiserationis, vnius,
aut plurium verborum iteratio, vt, Teren. Negat Phanium esse ha^c sibi cognatam
Demipho? Ha^c Demipho negat sibi cognatam?

Reduplicacion is a rehearsyng again of one word or more, for the more
vehemence or some pity, as. Terence. This Phanium to be his cowsin, does
Demipho deny? Does Demipho deny this Phanium to be his cowsin.

Nec multum ab (...) figura distat Interpretatio hoc tantum differens, quod in
hac eadem iteratur sententia, verbis per figuram aliquam, aut (...) rationem
commutatis. Cicero. Hic tu qua letitia perfruere? quibus gaudiis exultabi^
quanta in valuptat^ Bacchabere? Fit and singulis verbis. Nobiscum iam versari
diutius non potes, non feram, non patiar, non sinam,

Interpretacion differs not much from this figure: herein only, that in
this alone thing and se^te^ce is rehearsed, the word by variacion being
changed. Cicero. What gladues shall thou feel? with what joys shall thou
leap? in how great rage of pleasure shalt thou be? It is also in several
words, thus: Thou caust now be no longar in our company. I will not bear
it, I will not abide it, I will not suffer it.

Epanalepsis, quum eadem dictio and in principio and in fine versus ponitur,
vt. Multa super pr^ amo, rogitans super Hectore multa. Sulpitius victor
Epanalepsim esse ait, eorundem verborum, and eiusdem sententiae, post multa
interiecta repetitione^. Numeratur etia^ inter figuras co^structionis

Epanalepsis, when al one word is pu^ in the beginning and in the end of a
verse: as. Many thiges they axed of Priamus and of ^ector many things. This
figure is spoken of hereafter among the ^igures of construction.

Epizeuxis, eiusdem dictionis sine medio congeminatio, cu^ impetu
pronuntiationis Cicero. Tu, tu Antoni, Cesari omnia permiscere cupienti,
caussa^ belli cuilis dedisti.

The doubling of one word nothing being betwixt: with a swift pronunciacion.
Cicero. Thou, thou Antony gaueste cause of ciuyle battle to Caesar, willing to
turn al vpside down.

Copulatio cognata repetitioni est, vbi idem verbum, aut nomen bis continuo
positum diuersa sig nificat. Vt est illud. Sed tame^ adillum diem Me^mius erat
Memmius. Posterius, notat eius iam cognitos mores.

Copulatio^ cousin to repeticion is, when all one word being put twice strayte
together, signifies diverse things, as is this. Yet at that day Memmius was
Memmius. This later notes his ma^^ers that were well known.

Huc pertinet Refractio, quum idem verbum, repetitur^n contrario sensu sic.
Scio totam hanc vi tam nihil esse quam amaritudinem, verum mihi quaeso da
huiusmodi amaritudinem.

Refraction serves to the like, when ^ll one word is repeted in a (...)
sense, as I know all this life to be but bitterness, but I pray you give me
such bitterness.

Traductio, quum eadem vox alio casu sepius repetita, non modo taedium nullum
affert, verum concinniorem quoque or ^em reddit, hoc pacto Diuitas sine diuitum
esse, tu vero virtutem praefer diuitijs. Nam si voles, ^rtutem cum diuitiis
co^parare, vix satis idoncae tibi videbuntur diuitiae, que virtutis pedissequae
sint.

Traduccion, when al one word repeted in another case, not only is not
tedious, but also makes ye oration more trim, thus. Suffer riches to belong
to rich men, but prefer thou virtue before riches. For if thou will compare
riches with virtue, thou shalt think riches scarce mete to be handmay dens
to virtue.

Diaphora, quu^ vox iterata ia^ aliud significat (...) prius. Ouidus. Talis
erat matersi modo matter erat pro, simaternu^ erga filia^ animu^ geret. Ide^. Et
multos (...) Hectoras esse puta. pro, multos viros fortes and Hectoris similes.

Diaphora, when the word reheared again signifies another thing than (...)
did before: as. Such was his mother, (...) she were his mother, for, if she
bare a motherly mind toward her son. Also. Think many Hectors to be there,
that is, many valiant men, and like un to Hector.

Annominatio, est declinatio, quaedam in contr^ ^ium ex similibus literis
additis, de^ptis, aut (...) tatis, cu^ similia verba acco^moda^tur. Ea multis
and variis rationibus conficitur: Et additis quidem hoc pacto. Hic sibi posset
te^perare misi amori mallet obtemperare. Demendis literis sic Si lenones
tanquam leones vitasset, vitaese tradidisset. Conmutandis hoc modo. Deligere
oportet, quem veli^ diligere.

Annominacion is a certain declining into a contrary, by a likelihoode of
letters, added, changed, or taken away: Added thus. If he had te^pered
himself from pleasure, he had not been thus (...) out of measure: By taking
away thus. If he had hated brokes, as well as books, he had been alive at this
hour. by changing thus. Give him a Bsble nay, give him a babble.

Asyndeton est, quae coniunctionibus sublati continuat or ationis parts. sic.
Deum time: rege^ vener are: parentibus obedito: bonos aemulare, im^ becillos
tolerato. Grauitatem addit praecipienti: and praecipue locum habet in
Articulis, and Me^bris.

Asyndeton is, which keeps ye parts of our speaking together, without help of
any conjunctions: thus. Fear God, reverence the king, obey thy parents, follow
good men, bear with the weak.

Articulus est, (...) singula verba distinguntur cesa or atione, hoc modo. Rem,
famam parents, amicos, deum, amisisti.

Article is, when each word is set from other by cutting the oration thus.
Thou have lost thy substance, thy name, thy parents, thy friends, and god
himself.

Membrum or ationis est, quod pa^cis verbi^ constructionem quidem absoluit, at
sententiam non item, Vt, patrimonium prodegisti, parents, i^ luctum
coniecisti: amicos abalienasti, famam co^caminasti: deum ad iram prouocasti,
Vtraque figura facit ad acrimoniam or ationis, quod veluti crebris ictibus
ferit animum: and in vtrisque obseruandum, vt per gradus increscat oration,
nimirum, vt quod grauissimum est, sit postremo loco. Quod si non fit, erit
congeries, na^ ea turba premit magis quam incremento. Gratiam quoque in
vtrisque addit Asyndeton.

Member of an Dracion is, which in few words makes an end in deed of the
Construccion, but not of the sentence also, as. Thou haste wasted thy
Patrimony, cast thy parents into sorrow, turned away thy friends, defiled
thy name: provoked God to anger. Both these figures serve to sharpness:
because in manner they stryke the mind with often strokes. And this must be
marked in both, that the speaking grow by degrees, so that the greatest be set
last. And if it so be not, then is it the figure called Congeries, which
forces more by heaping, the^ by e^crease. They both are well set out by
this figure Asynd^ton. Membris gratiam addit partium aequalitas. Creci (...),
Latini compar appellant, quae taemen non digitis, sed aurium sensu quodam
diiudicanda est, Puerile siquidem est numerare syllabas, quum pauciores si
productae sunt, frequenter aequent numero plures. Sed tantum affert vsus and
exercitatio facultatis, vt animi quodam sensu par membraum superioeri r^ferre
possimus. Quale est pro Lucio Valerio Flacco. Nominibusque recitatis homo
audacissimus pertimuit, loquacissimus obmutuit, Item, in prelio pater mortem
oppetebat, domi filius nuptias comparabat.

The equality of parts much commends this figure called Membruin: which
equalitte must yet be tried by a certain secret sense of the ear, and not by
measuring upon our fyngers. For that is childish to tell the syllables, when
oftentimes a few long syllables match in measure many that be short. But use
and exercise does so much, that we may soon refer one member to another.
As, for L. Ualerius Flaccus. When the names were recited, the bold man was
aferde, and the great babbler hild his tongue. Also, the father died in war, the
sonn^ ^as married at home.

Continuatio est dens^ and continens frequenta^io verborum, cum absolutione
sententiarum. Ea vtemur commodissime tripartito. In sententia, hoc pacto. Ei
non multum obesse potest fortuna, qui sibi firmiu^ in virtute, quam in casu
praesidium collocauit. In contrario hoc modo. Nam si quis spei non multum
collocarit in casu, quid est quod ei casus magnopere obesse possit? In
conclusione, hoc pact^. Quod si in eos plurimum fortuna potest, qui suas
rations omnes in casum co^lerunt: non su^^ ^mma committenda fortunae, ne
magnam nimis ^n nos habeat dominationem.

Continuacion, is a continual heaping of words, the sentences also
perfighted: and it may be used three ways. In sentence thus. Fortune cannot
hurt him much, which more firinely trusts in virtue, the^ in chance. In
contrary thus. For if a man put not hopein chance, how shall chance much
hurt him? In conclusion thus. And if fortune may do much (...) them, which
has put a^ their accomptes upon chance: all are not to be committed to
fortune, lest fortune have to great a dominacio^ upon the

Similiter cadens est, cum in eadem constructione verboru^, ^uo aut plura
su^tverba, quaesimiliter ^sde^ casibus efferu^tur, hoc modo. Homine^ laudas
egentem virtutis, abunda^te^ f^licitatis. C^cero pr^ Flacco. Nulla est in his
varietas opinionis, null^ voluntatis, nulla sermonis.

Falling like is, when in the same construction of words, there be. ii. worde^
or more, which be spoken alike in the self same cases, as. Thou praisest a man
nedy of health, ple^tiful of wealth. Cicero for Flaccus. There is in the^ no
variety of opinion, none of affection, none of communication.

Similiter d^sinens est, cu^ dictiones vel senten^ similes babent exitus, vt.
Turpiter audes facere nequiter studes dicere. Viuis inuidiose, (...) studiose,
loqueris odiose. Haec duo ornamenta inter se vehementer co^ueniunt, quorum
alterum in exitus, alterum in casus similitudine versatur.

Ending alike, when words or (...), have like e^dinges, thus. Thou dare do
filthily, and studiest to speak baudely. Thou li^st disdaifully, thou sinest
pu^ posely. Thou speak hatefully. These two kinds of orname^tes, agree
greatly together: of which the o^e is in like endinges: the other in ^ke cases.

FIGVRAE RHETHORIC AE Secundi gen^s.
INterrogatio, Interrogationum duae sunt formae Simpl^x. vt. Sed qui vos
tandem? quibus aut venistis ab oris.

Figurata multas habet species: Interrogamus enim nonnunquam, non sciscitandi
gratia, sed instandi, Cicero. Quousque tandem abutere Catilinae patientia
nostra? Aut miserationis caussa, V^ Sinon apud Vi^gilium. Na^ qu^ me tellus,
quae me nunc aequor a possunt accipere? Aut indignationis. Et quisqua^ numen
^nonis adore^ Praetere^. Aut admirationis. Dij boni, quid illic hominu^
litigat. Aut acrius impera^di gratia. No^ armae expedient, ^otaque ex vrbe
sequentur? Seruit haec figura multis and var^s affectibus. Tu^ vero
co^modissime adhibebitur, ^u^ quid argume^tis est euict^

Of demaundes there be two sorts. One plain, as. I pray you tell me what you
be, or from what coa^es you do come

The figurative has many kinds. For sometime we are, not to have an answer,
but to set our purpose more for (...) thus. Cicero. Then Latiline, how long
wylt thou abuse our patience? Or for p^tie sake, as Sinon does in (...). Alas
what ground, what sea may now receive me? for anger also. And will any man
hereafter worship the power of Juno? for meruaylyng. Terence. O Lord what a
sort now go to the law? or more sharpelye to command them. Will they not now
bring forth they^ harnes, and follow me through all the city? This figure
serves to many affections, but specially when we have won by reasonyng.

Subiectio, quum ipsirespondemus nostrae interrogationi, vt, Ideone studia
deseremus, quod mag nus in his subeundus labor. Nequaequam, Item, Quero vnde
iste diuitias nactus est? An amplum patrimonium relictum est? At patris bona
^runt, Hereditas aliqua obuenit? non potest di^. Imo a necessarijs omnibus,
exhaeredatus est.

Subjection is, when we answer to our own demand thus. Shall we therefore
forsake studies, because great pain must be taken in them? No verelye. Also,
I axe where this fellow gate this riches. Had he any great patrimony left him?
May, al his fathers goods were sold. Had he any thing by enheritaunce? it
cannot be said, for he was disherited from all things necessary.

Exclamatio est, quae conficit significationem do^ris, aut indignatione^
alicuius, per hominis, aut (...) cuiuspiam compellationem. Cicero, O fallacem
^ominum spem, fragilemque fortunam, and inanes nostras contentiones quae in
medio spacio saepe fra^guntur, and corruunt, and ante in ipso casu obruun^
(...), quam portum conspicere potuerunt.

Exclamation is, which shows the ^ignification of sorrow, or anger for
^omewhat, by calling upon any manne (...) thing: thus. Cicero. O deceyuable
(...) of men, and frail fortune, and our ^ayne contentions, which often time
^re broken in the midde way, and rushe ^owne, and in the very fall are
ouer^helmed before they can see the haven.

Execratio est, cum aliquid detestamur propter ingentia quaesecum affert mala,
sic. O (...) idololatriam, quae a^o aignum honorem aufer^ peccatoribus
creaturis illam tribuens, and idol^ per hominum manus fabricatis.

Execration is, when we deteste any thing, for the great evils that it bring
eth with it, thus. O detestable Idol^ try, which takes away the honor dew
to God, and gives it to sinne^ creatures, and images made by man hands.

Dubitatio, quum dubitare nos significamu^ vel vnde suma^us exordium propter
reru^ mu^ titudinem, vel quid potissimum agamus dolor (...) liquo affecti.
Cicero pro Roscio. Quid primum q^ rar, aut vnde pot^ssimum Iudices exordiar? a^
quod, aut a quibus auxilium petam? Tale est, (...) loquar an sileam?

Dubitation, when we signify that w^ doubt either where to take our be gy^
uyng for the multitude of things or for sorrow say, whereat shall we first
^egi^. Cicero for Roscius. Of what she I first complain^? Or, O judges, when
shall I first begin: What, or of who^ she I call for help?

Co^municatio, quu^ aut ipsos aduersarios co^sulinus, aut cu^ iudicibus
deliberamus, qui^facie^du^ ^t aut quid factu^ oportuerit. vt, Cedo si vos eo
loco (...), quid ta^de^ faceretis aliud? Et, in hoc turbu entissimo rerum
statu, date consilium quid mihi (...) faciendum.

Communication, when either we ^re our adversaries counsel, or delibe rate
with ye judges, what is to be done or ought to have been done. as. Tell me ^f
you were in the like state, what other thing would you do? And in this
troublous world, give me counsel, what you think best to be done.

Permissio, quoties aut dissimulationem, aut as^euerationem habet, tum demum
figura est. As^euerationem sic. Perfrica frontem, and dicte dig^iorem qui
praetor fieres quam Catonem. Dissimu ^ationem. vt apud Terentium. Quid isthuc?
Si ti^i isthuc placet, profundat, perdat, pereat, nihil ad (...) attinet. Haec
enim artificios^ prohibitio est, per ^ronicam concessionem.

Permissio^, when it has a dissimulatio^ or an affirmatio^, than in deed is it
a figure: asseueratio^ thus. Rub thy forehed (...) say thou art more worthy to
be co^sull then Cato. Dissimulation thus. T^ re^ce. What means this? If it so
pleas thee, let him wast, let him destroy, an^ be destroyed, I have nothing to
do wit^ it. This is a crafty forbidding, by a mo^ king grant.

Licentia est, quum mitigamus liberius dicta, n^ auditorem offendant, hoc
pacto. Si molesta est or a^ tionis acerbitas, cogitate graves morbos, non sa^
nari leuibus pharmacis.

License, when we mitigate things spoken freelye before, lest the heare^
should be offended, thus. If my bytte^ words grieve you, remember, that sor^
sickness is not eased with light remedies.

Diminutio, cum quod in nobis, aut in his quo^ defe^dimus est egregium^ne qua
significetur arrogans ostentatio, diminuitut, and attenuatur oratione, sic. Nam
hoc pro meo iure Iudices dico, me l^ bore and industria curasse, vt disciplinam
militarem non in postremis tenerem. Hic si quis dixisse^ vt optime tenerem,
tametsi vere dixisset tamen a^ rogans visus esset. Nunc and ad muidiam vitandam
and ad laudem comparandam, satis dictum est Porro, vt licentia prestat,
neoffendat libertas: it^ Diminutio facit, ne quod necessario dicitur,
arroganter, dictum videatur.

Diminution, when any thing that is excellent in us, or in those that we
defend, is by words diminished, to avoid boastyng, thus. For this dare I
boldly say, you Judges, that I have trauayled and labored to understand the
feats of war, not with ye worst. Here if a man should have said to be
as good as the best, although he should have said true: yet he should have
been thought proud, and arroga^t. Now to avoid disdayn, and get praise,
enough is spoken. Further, as this figure Licentia, causes that our free
spekyng does no displeasure: so does diminution make that which is necessarily
spoken, seem not spoken proudly.

Reiectio est cum eludimus aliquid ab aduersario contra nos propositum: ad quod
respondere difficile fuerit, and significamus vel indignu^ esse de quo dicatur,
vel quod adrem nihil pertineat, (...) seruaturos nos in alium opportumorem
locu^, hoc modo. Hac de requid attinet dicere, quan^ ad institutum non multum
facit. Huiusm^di es^ pro Milone. Quid enim odisset Clodium Mito, segetem ac
materiam gloriae suae? Nam vel principale argumentum Clodianorum elud^t tantu^
Cicero, non diluit.

Reiection is, when we trifle out a thing brought against us by our aduersarye,
to the which it is hatde to answer, and then say either it is not worcester thy to
be spoken of or that it pertains ^t to the purpose, or that we will keep it
till another meter time, thus. What need me speak of this matter, seeing it
makes not much to the purpose. Like is in the oration for Milo. For why
should Milo hate Clodius, seeing he is the gro^d and chief cause of his glory.
Here did Cicero trifle out even the principal argument of the Clo dians, and
did not solue it.

Gradatio est, quum consequentia membra ab ^isdem oriuntur verbis, quibus
antecedentia ^laudiuntur: atque ita velut gradibus quibusda^ ^ectitur oration,
vt, Africano virtutem indu^ ^ria, virtus gloriam, gloria aemulos comparauit.
Grauior hic est, quia res ipsa gradus habet. Est aliquando in verbis gradatio.
Vt, Torua Leenae ^upum sequitur lupus ipse capellam. Haud dissimile est
Anadiplosi, de qua dictum est antea.

Gradation is, when the words that go before, be forthwith repeted, and so
^unneth as it were from step to step, thus. Industry to Affrican gat
virtue, virtue glory, glory disdain. Here the matter has degrees, and
therefore is more grave. Sometime it stands in words, as. The Leeues
follows the woulf, the woulf the goat. It is much like Anadiplosis, whereof
we spoke before.

Commutatio fit inuerso sententiae ordine. vt, Non est viuendum vt edas, sed
edendum vt viuas. Huius generis est illa non sine causs^ laudata sententia. Si
quid turpe facias cum voluptate: voluptas abit, turpitudo manet: si quid
bonestu^ facias cu^ labor, labor abit, honestu^ mane^

Commutation is, when the order of the sentence is turned, thus. We must not
live to eat, but eat toliue. Of this suit is this se^te^ce most worthily
praised If thou do any sin with pleasure, the pleasure goes away: the
sin remains: if thou do virtuously with labor, thy labor goes away,
the ver tue remains.

Contentio est commoda contrariorum inter se relatio. Fitque vel verbis inter
se pugnantibus: vel se^tentiis co^trariis. Sic qui suis rationibus inimicus
semper fuerit, eum quomodo alienis rebus amicum fore speres? Hic in sententiis
est pugna. Assentatio iucunda principia, eadem exitus amarissimos habet. Hic in
verbis.

^ontention is a proper setting together of contraries. And either it is in
words that be contrary, or in contrary things, thus. He that always was
enemy to his own reckonynges, how should we hope him to be a fre^d to other
men's matters? Here is contrariety in se^tences. Flattery has pleasant
begynnynges, and the same bitter endynges. Here is the strife in words.

Occupatio, tacitae obiectionis refutatio est: vt cu^ ipsi ammaduertentes quid
obsit nobis, prius id diluimus, qua^ obiici possit. Vt Ciecro dicitscire se
(...) ^ri quosdam, quod is qui per tot annos defender^ ^ultos, leserit neminem,
ad accusandum Verre^ escenderit. Dein ostendit hanc ipsam accusati^em Verris,
sociorum esse defensionem.

When perceiving aforehande an ob^ction that might be laid against (...) and
hurt us, we wipe it away or ever (...) be spoken, as. ^icero says: that he
^noweth some me^ will marvel, sith so ^any years he defended many and hurt
^ne, he does now come to accuse verres ^hen does he show that this accusa^on
of Uerres. isa defense of their ^lowes.

Anthipophora, quum respondemus ad objection ^m quae Hypophora dicitur. Cicero.
In verrem: ^t enim haec ita commissa sunt abisto, vt non cog ^ta sint ab
omnibus. Hominem esse arbitror ne^nem, qui nomen istius audierit, quin facta
qu^ ^e eius nefaria commemorare possit. Virg. Veru^ ^ceps pugnae fuerat
fortuna: fuisset. Quem me^i moritura?

Anthypophora, when we make answer an objection that is laid against us,
thus. ^icero against Uerres. Yea^ but you say he has done these things so,
that all men knew it not. I think there be no man which has heard of his
name, but can also rehearse his mischeuous acts. Uirgil. But the chance of
fight would have been doubtful. What then? Whom feared I which was ready to
dye.

Confessio, cum quedam largimur aduersario, vt reliqua magis exagger ari
possint, vt. Esto san^ fueris aliquando amicus, vna militaueris, sint aliqua
tua in eum beneficia, quid tum? An non potuit dissilire gratia?

^onfession, when we grant some things to our aduersarye, that the rest may
be made the more grievous, thus. Be it that thou wast once his friend, his
fellow in war, and that thou have done somewhat for him. What than? Might ye
not therefore fall out?

Paradiastote, cum ita aliquid conceditur, vt, vicinum quiddam detrahi possit.
vt, Veritas la^ borare potest, opprimi non potest.

Paradiastole, when we so graunt^ ^omewhat, that we take away some thing that
is nere vntoit, thus. Troth may be in ieopardy, but never oppressed.

Aetiologia, cum propositi alicuius statim caussam subijcimus. Cicero pro
Archia. Si quid est in me ingenij, etc. Vendicabit iure Archia. Si quid mihi
princeps ad suscipiendam rationem borum studiorum.

Aetiologia, when we show by and by the cause of our purpose. ^icerd for
Archia. This wit that I have (you Judges,) Archias may justly cha^nge it unto
him. For he was the (...) and principal, that made meto set my self to these
manner of studies.

Dicaeologia, cum aliquam officij rationem expo ^nimus, aut excusationem, quod
videlicet iure id, et honest faciamus, aut alioqui caussamur ^qui ^atem: vt,
Lapsus sum sed adolescens, and inter ta^les versatus, inter quos non potui non
corrumpi.

Dicaeologia, when we thewe some cause of ourt duetye, or some excuse that it
is honest so to do, Or lay ^ome reason for our self, thus. I did amiss,
but I was young, and in such coumpanye, where I must of force be naught.

Anangeon, cum allegatur necessitaes, quae vim in deliberando summam habet, vt,
Amicum deserui, fed coactus a legibus. Co^seruaui amici^ fidem dum per leges
licuit, nunc ab illo ab alienauit me, non voluntas, fed legum vis.

Anang^ when we aledge necessity, which in de libe ration is of great force,
as. I forsook my friend, but the law compelled me: I kept friendship as long
as the law suffered me, now I am turned from him: not by will, but by fore^ of
law.

De postremo figurarum genere.
PArtitio est, quum id quod generatim dici p^terat, per parts latius
explicatur. Vt si dicamus, Cyclopediam absoluit. Hanc sententiam explicare
potes hoc modo: Mire poetarum om nium fabulas tenet, Rhetorum flosculos,
Grammaticorum laboriosos canones, Dialecticorum argurias Phisices arcana,
vltramundanae sapientiae ar du^

Theologorum abdita, Mathematicas apodixes, a^ strorum motus, numerorum
rations, verboru^, mo^ tium, fluminum, fontium, situs, nomina, interualla,
vocum co^cenius, antiquitates, nouitates, greece atque latin: denique quicquid
vnquam eruditionis ab egregiis autoribus repertum, ac traditum fuit, id
vniuersum vnus hic absolute perceptum cognitumque babet, ac meminit.

Partition is, when that that might be spoken generally, is more largely
declared by parts. As if we would say: he is perfectly seen in all sciences.
This sentence thou may declare by parts in this wise. He knows
merueylously well the fables of Poets, the flowers of Rhetorique, the
painful rules of Grammar, the subtilties of Logiti^ns, the secrets of
natural philosophy, the hardness of wisdom supernatural, the mysteries of
divinity, the mathematical demonstrations, the mocions of ^tarres, the
reasons of numbers, the mea^uring of ye earth, the situations, names and spaces
of Cities, Mountains, Floudes, and Fountaynes, the dyffe^ence, and harmonies
of Tunes, histories old, and new: antiquities, novelties, Greek and Latin:
finally whatsoever good learning has been found and taught of good authors,
all that wholly has this one man perfitlye perceived, known, and remembered.

Enumeratio est, quando singulatim ea co^memoramus, per quae ad exitum rei
peruentum est, vt hanc sententiam, Cicero Catiline conatus oppressit ita potes
locupl^tare. Catilinae nefarios conatus per iuuenes perditissimos, totius
ciuitatis Romanae in ternecionem molientes, Marcus Tullius Cicero consul sua
sagacitate statim odoratus est, singulaeri vigilantia peruestigauit, summa
prudentia deprehendit, miro in Remp. studio prodidit, incredibili eloquentia
conuicit, grauissima autoritate, ar^ mis, atque felicitate sustulit.

Enumeratio^ is, when we rehearse those things seuerallye, by which ye matter
was brought to pass: as. That Cicero oppressed the purposes of Catiline: thus
you may set it forth. The myschieuous enterprises of Catiline, by most
ungracious young men, which went about the utter destruction of Room,
Marcus Tullius the Consul, by his foresyghte did quickelye smell out, by his
^uguler vigilance sought out, by his high prudence found out, by his
meruaylous love to the common wealth showed out, by his incredyble Eloquence
proved out, by his grave authorytye, power, and happiness, thruste out.

Distributio est, cum i^plures res, aut psonas certas negotia quedam
dispertiuntur, hoc modo. Senatus officium est consilio ^uitatem iuuare,
Magistratus officium est, opera and diligentia; consequi (...) senatus: populi
officium ^st, res optimas, and homines idoneos maxim suis sententijs, eligere,
and probare. Cicero pro L. Murena: Hic ve^ro iudices, and fuit in Asia, and
viro f^rtissimo parenti suo, magno adiumento in periculis, solatio in
laboribus, gratulationi in victoria fuit.

Distribution is, when business are dyspersed into many things, or certain
persons, thus. It is ye office of the senate to help ye city with counsel: of ye
magistrate with labor and diligence to do the will of the Senate: of the
people to chose out the best things, and to chose and allow men that be most
metest. Cicero for Lucius Murena. And this man, you judges, both was in Asia,
and greatly help that good man his father in perils, did comfort him in
sorrows, and reioysed in his victories.

Descriptio nominatur, quae rerum consequenti^ continet perspicuam and
dilucidam cum grauitate expositionem, hoc modo. Nam neminem ve strum fugit
quirites, capta vrbe, quae miseriae con sequi soleant: arma qui contra
tulerunt, statim cr^ delissime trucidantur: caeter^, qui possunt per (...) and
vires laborem far, rapiuntur in seruit^tem: qui non possunt, ^ita priuantur:
vno denique atque eodem tempore, domus hostili flagrat incendio, and quos
natura, aut volunta^, necessitudine, aut beneuolentia coniunxerit,
distrahuntur, Liberi, partim e gremijs parentu^ diripiuntur, partim in sinu
iugulantur, partim ante pedes construpa^tur. Nemo iudices est, qui possit satis
rem consequi verbis, n^c refer oratione magnitudinem calamitatis.

It is called Description, which conteyneth a plain and euidente setting out
of things that follow after, and that with a certain gravity, thus? You
know right well, you people, when the city is taken, what miseries be wo^t to
follow. Such as fought against them, are by and by most cruelly killed, other
which be so strong that they be hable to labor, are made bondeslaues: they
that cannot, are slain: at one time be our houses burnt, our kynsmenne and
acquaintance pulled away from us. Young children, some are pulled from their
mothers lappes, and some are threatled in their mothers arms, and some defiled
before their fete: you judges, there is no man hable toexpresse in words or
writing the great sorrow and calamity.

Demonstratio, quam Greci Hypotyposin vocant, ^st oration exprimens rem,

Huius species sunt.

Prosopopoeia, ^ua homo quispiam depingitur. Si cut Plutarchus illustres
Graecos, and Latinos, Suctonius item duodecini Cesares. Quanquam Rhetores fere
latius vtuntur vocabulo prosopopoeie, nimi^um, vt has se^ species sequentes
complectatur

Characterismus, effictio, vel pictura corporis, aut animi, Sic Dauus effingit
Critonem. Choerea senem illum importunum.

(...), fictio personae. Quae duas habet species. Prior est, pers^nae fictae
descriptio: poetis propria, oratoribus rara. Vt, Virgilius fingit Sybyllam
furente^ fingit personas apud inferos. Altera f^rma est, quum ^ei mutae, aut
incorporeae affingimus personam, and sermonem, and affectum hominis, aut
animalis, quem admodum Harpy^s, f^riis, demonibus, somno, f^i, ^nuidiae, f^mae
i^ ^uti, and similibus personam, vel se^monem affing^ re p^eta s^lent. Item,

Ethopoeia proprietas, vel expressio moru^, et affectu^ mitiu^. Hu^tis us tres
sut formae. Prima expressio more prolixior, velut i^genioru^, artiu^, virtutu^,
vitioru^. Si^ vanu^ ostentatore^ exprimit, I hrasone^ Terentius, milite^
Plautus. Atque haec forma propria Comoedijs, atque dialogis est. Secu^da forma
est expressio naturaliu^ propens^onu^, ac natura insitaru^ affectioonu^. Vt est
expressio amoris paterni erga lib^ros: co^ iugu^, and amicoru^ inter sc:
co^iu^ctionis aequaliu^, hospitum, vicinoru^: disiunctioms, hostium inter se.
In qualibus effige^dis mirus est apud Latinos artifex Liuius. Peculiariter ^ni^
historia animoru^ cupidita tes, co^silia, and res gestas, fere sine tragi ^is
(...) motibus depi^gi. Tertia sorma est, expr^ssio affectionu^ leniorum, quae
no^ ita perturba^t animos, neque prae cipita^t. Vt siquando letiores affectus
hominum erga nos, aliosue captamus: and blandie^do elicimus vt quum animus in
spem, in loe^itiam erigitur, and in ris^n quoque.

Pathopoeia, id ^st, veheme^tioru^ affectuum, and p turbationum expressio.
Huius duae su^t f^rmae. Pri or, qua^ Imaginatione^ voca^t, qua metus, dolor,
ira, furor, odium, ^nuidia, eff^ enis cupiditas, libido (...) modica, sp^s,
i^moderata letitia, perturbatioque any mi describitur, and excitatur. Huius
exempla sunt passi^obuia in Tragoediis. Alter a forma est Co^mi seratio: qua
eliciuntur lachrimae, vel mouetur mise ricordia, vel captatur venia. Huius
exe^pla sunt ob uia in perorationibus Ciceronianis, in querelis ^pud Poetas.

Sermocinatio, quoties^ person^ affingitur or ^io breuis, vellonga, pro decoro

Mimisis, imitatio sermonis, vel morum, qua (...) modo personae orationem, sed
etiam gestum effingimus. Has praedictas sex species, Fabius atque (...),
subiiciunt Prosopopoeie.

Topographia, loci descriptio, vt Carthaginis in primo Aeneidos, Huc refer
Cosmographiam.

Topothesia, loci fictio, quum d^ribitur locus, qui fortasse no^ est vspiam in
rerum natura. Huius exemplum habes Thoma Mori Vtopiam, vel saltem non est talis
qualis fingitur. Vt in sexto Aene idos inferoru^, and Elisii descriptio. Huc
refer Astrothesiam, apud Aratum, Higinium, Manilium, Pontanum.

Chronographia, descriptio temporis, vt. Noctis in quarto Aenesdos, Pacifici

Demonstration is, when we so plainly and copiously express a thing, a person,
and an affection, manners, speech, and circu^staunce, that the reader, seems to
se^ it before his eyes, as though it were liuelye painted in a table. The kinds
be these.

The description of a thing, when not content, lightly and briefly to have
showed it, we so set it before the Readers eyes, that it seems not to be told,
but to be done: and the reader not to here it, but se it. Such is the
description of the floude in the first book of Metamorphosis, and of a
tempest in the second

Prosopopoeia, when any man is described. As Plutarche does the noble men,
both Grecians and Latins. Suetonius also the twelve Emperors. How be it, the
Rhethoricians use this word, Prosopopoeia largely to comprehend these six
kinds following.

Characterismus, the ^pression or painting out, either of the body or mind So
Dauus fetteth out ^rito: and (...) the troublous old man.

Prosopographia, the fayning of a per son. This has two kinds. The first is
the description of a feined person properlye belongyng to Poets, syldome used
of Orators. As Uirgil fayneth S^bbill to be mad, and persons beneath in
hell. Another form is, when unto a thing that is dumme, or without a body,
we f^yne a person, speech, and affection of a man, or some living thing, as
to the birds called Harpyans, Furyes, Deuilles, Sleep, Hungar, Envy, Fame,
Uertewe, and like, the Poets be ^woonte to feign a person, and speech. Also
when Orators make the common wealth speak, or as it were raise up again
dead men.

Ethopoeia, propertye, or expressyon of mylde manners and affections. Of this
there be three kinds. The first, a large setting out of manners, as of
w^ttes, arts, virtues, or vices. So Terence sets out boastyng. Thraso,
Plautus, a crakyng souldyoure. And this facyon properlye belongs to
^ommoedies, and Dialogues. The second form is a^ ^pressyon of natural
incl^nations, and affections natural, as of the fathers love toward the
children, the housebande and wife, of friends among them selves, of
compaygnions, geastes, neighbors: of hatred also, and of enemies. In
expressyng of these among the Latins, Ciuius is very ^uit ^yng. For an
Hystorye chyeflye setiet^ out the desire of minds, purposes, and deeds,
without any great outcryes, and rages. The third kind is a setting out of
cold and mylde affections, that do not so greatelye trouble the mind nor
toss it: as when we go about gentely to geat men's love and favor, or
that the mind is brought into hope, myrthe, or laughter.

Pathopoeia, that is an expression of vehemente affections and perturbations.
Of this there be two kinds. The first is called Imagination, whereby, fe^re,
sorrow, anger, furye, hatred, envy, unbridled desire, lust immoderate, hope,
or gladness, and the passions of the mind is described and styrred up.
Exaumples of these be every where in Tragedies. There is an other facion
called Commiseration, whereby we make men weep, move men to mercy, or to
pardon an offense. Ready exaumples of these are in the perorations of Cicero,
and in Poets, in their complaints.

Sermocination, is when we feign a person, and make him speak little or much
according to comlines. Such be the Concions of Liuie, and sermones or orations
made in other Historiographers. When the person that we feyn, speaks all him
self: the figure is called Conformation. But when we now and then answer to
demaundes that he puts unto us, it is called, Sermo cination.

Mimisis, an imitation of speech or manours, whereby we counterfayte, not
only what one said, but his gesture also. These foresaid six kinds,
Quintilian and other put under Prosopopoe^a.

Topographia, the description of a place, as of Carthago in the first of
Eneidos. Hither refer Cosmographie.

Topothesia, the faynyng of a place, When a place is descrybed, as paraduenture
such none is. Exaumple of this is the Utopia of Spr Thomas Moore. Or else is
not such a place as it is, feigned to be. As, is hell, and heaven in the syxte
of Eneidos. Hither pertayneth the situacio^ of stars, in Aratus, Higinius,
Manilius and Pontanus.

Chronographia, the description of time, as of night in the fowerth of Eneidos.
Of the peace world in the fourth Egloge of Uirgil. Of the four ages in the
first of Metamorphoseos.

Magna pars Eloquentiae sita estin augendo, ac diminuendo. Omnis autem
amplificatio ac diminutio, petitur aut ex rebus, aut ex verbis. Ex verbis sic.

Quum commutamus vocabulum, pro vero ponentesatrotias. Vt si occisum dicamus
eum, qui cae sus tantummodo fuit.

Augemus per incrementum, sic. Facinus est vinciri ^iuem Romanum, scoelus
verberari, parici dium necari, quid di^am in crucem tollere?

Increscit oration per Congeriem, In cetu vero populi R^ni, negotium publicum

totum tribunal implere, an non turpissimum? Differt a priore, impetu.

Per comparationem quoque in^rescit oration. Fictione, et exempli collatione.
Fictione sic. Si me fer ut isthoc pacto metuerent, vt te metuunt omnes ciues

Amplificamus per coniecturas sic. Maro de Polyphemo. Trunca manus pinum regit.
Hinc enim coniicimus, quantae fuerit totius corporis mag nitudo, eum pro
scipione haberet pinum arborem.

Incrementum maius sumitur ex rebus, quas semper comitantur circumstantiae.

Instrumentum Gladio peior^, lingua serpens Eua^occidit Et haec est per
circu^stantias amplificatio

A great part of Eloquence stands by increasing and diminishing. And all
amplification is taken either of things or words: by words thus.

When we change the very word, and instead thereof put a bygger, and say:
Thou have killed him: where peradventure he gave him but a few stripes.

An other kind of Amplification is, ^hen our words increase one bygger then
other, thus. It is offense to bind a Citezin of Rome, haynous-to beat him,
manslaughter to kill him. What shall I call it to hang him?

We amplify also by heapyng things fast together. In the company of the
people of Rome, having a common office, Master of the horse, there to cast up
thy stynkyng gobbettes, and to fyl^ thy lap and the judgment seat, is not
this a shame? This differs from the other, because it goes a pace: and the
other by steps and distinctions.

We amplifye by comparison: and se^ one exaumple to an other: or feign as
though such thing had happened, thus: If my servants did fear me in such
wise as all thy Citezins fear thee, I would think it good to leave my house.
By comparyng one exaumple to an other, thus. Cicero. Did I pray you that noble
man Scipio being a private person kyl Tiberius Gracchus, which sha ked the
common wealth but a little: and shall we being Co^suls suffer Catiline, y^ goes
about to wast the whole world with murder and fire?

We amplify by conjecture thus Uirgil speaking of Polyphemus. He held in his
hand the body of a pyne tree. By this we conjecture what a great body he
had, when he had a pine tree for his staff.

A greater am^lification of things. Which always have their circumstances
with them. A person has these. Na cion, country, kind, age educatio^, hauour
of the body, fortune, condition, nature of mind, forededes, and names. Ex
amples. If a man despise any thing that properlye belongs to his nation, it
is more grievous, as. For if an English man do despise the feate of shooting.
The c^untrey does not always cause amplification: but we may say of God. He
would be borne in the goodliest part of the world, yt as it were in an open
playing place, his might and power, might shine more abroad. Kind. As filthy
talk is a foul thing in a woman. Age. Lechery becomes not an old man,
Educatio^. ^ero (...) his first years was well brought up, it wastherfore ye
more shame to (...) afterward. The hauior of the bodi. Since god has made the
a fair psonage, why dooest thou so filthily? Fortune. Thou art of low degree
becu^ a noble man, the worse is now thy pride. Co^dicio^. Thou art a private
man and dare thou resist the magistrates? The nature ofthe mind. God has
created ye of an high and noble heart, why the^ fekest thon for so small
trifles. Fordedes. Now to be a sluggard which be fore have done so goodly
acts, is a (...) shame. Name. To sleep in so great a mat ter, and to be named
waker, was this (...)

The circumstances of things be these. Cause, place, time, instrument. Cause.
Thou wast the first that moved to this murder, the fault therefore is the
greter Place. He defiled ye virgin in ye (...). Time. The^ eat he flesh, when
there was proclaimed open fasting, Instrument. The serpent killed Eve with his
to^g worse then any sword. Thus now may yon se what Amplificatio^ rises by the
circumstances belonging to persons, and things.

Freque^tatio est, cu^ res in tota caussa dispersa, co gu^tur (...) in locu^,
quo grauior aut acrior, aut criminosior oration sit, hoc pacto A quo (...) abest
^ste vitio? quid est, Iudices, cur velitis eu^ liberare? suae pudicuiae
proditor est, insidiator alienae, cupidus, in te^perans, petulans, superbus,
impius in pare^tes, i^gra ^us i^ a^icos, infestus in cognatos, in supereores
co^tumax, in aequos, and pares fastidiosus, in inferiores crudelis, denique in
omnes intollerabilis.

Frequentatio^ is, when the things that (...) dispersed through all the cause
be (...) together into one place, that the ^ratio^ may be the moregraue,
sharper, or ^fuller, thus. What vice has he ^ot? why should you deliver hi^
you iud^s? His own chastity he sets forth cu^ whose will, he lies i^ wait
for others, he (...) inte^perate, wanton, proud, unnatural (...) his (...),
(...) to his friends, ^roubleso^ to his kinsfolks, stubberne to ^is betters,
dis^ful to his fellows, cruel to his inferiors, intolerable to all men.

Congeries est multiplicatio verborum, aut sentetiaru^rem eandem velut
inculcantium. Hoc di^ fert ab Incremento, quod illic per gradus incresci^
oration, hic velut aceruo. Cic. Quid enim ille tuu Tubero districtus in acie
Pharsalica gladius agebat? cuius latus ille mucro petebat? Qui sensu^ erat
armorum tuorum? Quae tua men's, oculi, m^ nus, ardor animi? Quid cupiebas? quid
optabas Quam multae voces hic sunt idem fere significan tes. Vt, gladius,
mucro, a^ma, Sensus, men's, any mus, cupiebas, optabas. Tum quot sententiae
eode^ spectantes, distringere in acie gladium, latus p^ tere, sensus armorum.
Eiusdem generis est sed a^ fectum habens mitiorem, quod ^st apud Virgili^ 3.
Eneid, Quid puer Ascanius, superatne and v^ citur aura Aetherea? nec adhuc
crude^bus oc^ bat ^mbris? Nihil enim aliud querit nisi an a^ huc supersit
Ascanius, sed affectus est, quod re^ eandem ter expressie.

^ongeries, is a multiplication (...) words, or sentences, as it were beatyn in
all one thing. It differs from e^crea^ in this point, because the oration
the^ grows as it were by degrees, and he^ ^y heaps. ^icero, Tubero, what did
thy drawn sweord in ye battle of Phat sal^a? whose side did the point strike
at?

What was the meaning of thine ar mour. What me^t thy mind, eyes, hands ^ury
of mind? What did thou covet? What did thou wish? How many words be
there here signifying almost all one thing? as: sweorde, point of the sweord,
weapons, sense, mind, ent^nte, did covet, did desire. Further, how
many sentences be there tendyng to one point, a^: to draw thy sweord in the
field, to run at his side, meaning of weapons. Of the same sort is, but ha
uyng a more mild affection, that is in ^irgil in the. iii. of Eneid. How
does the child Ascanius, is he on the earth; does he eat the breath
Ethereal? does he not yet lie below in the cruel dark places? He axeth nothing
else, but whether Ascanius be alive, but it is the affection that expresses one
thing thrice.

Diuisio est, quae rem semou^ns are, vtramque ^bsoluit ratione subiecta, hoc

improbus non commoueris. Et illud. Quid nunc ego de meis proprijs meritis
preaicem? Si me ministis, obiundam: sin obliti estis, cum ^e nihil egerim, quid
est quod verbis proficere possim?

Division is, whithe remouyng one thing from another, ends the^ both by
showing a reason, thus. Why should I now then lay any thing to thy charge? If
thou be good thou have not deserved it: if thou be naught, thou carest not for
it. Also, what should I now speak of mine own proper merits. If you
remember them I shall but trouble you: if you have forgot them, when I have done
nothing by deed, what may I profit by words?

Correctio est, quae tollit quod dictum est, and aliud magis i^oncum iu eius
Iocum reponit, Sic Quod si iste suos amicos rogasset, imo innu^sset do, hoc
facile perfici possit,

Correction is, which takes away that that is spoken, and puts a more
meter thing in his place, thus. That i^ he had prayed his friends, yea had n^
more but beckte, this thing might eas^ ly have been done.

Definitio est, qua rei alicuius propria vis explic^ rur, breuiter et absolute
hoc modo, No^ est ista dili ge^tia sed auaritia: eo quod dilige^tia est
accurrata co^ seruatio suoru^, auaritia n^uriosa appetitio alienoru^

Difinition is, whereby the proper pith of any thing is declared briefly and
perfectly, thus. This is not diligence, but covetousness: decause diligence is
an hedy conservation of that that is his own covetousness is an injurious desyer
of other men's goods.

Transitio est, qua monemus breuiter quid dictu^ ^it, and quid co^sequatur, vt,
In patria^ qualis fuerit habetis: nunc in parents qualis extiterit, accipite

Transition is, whereby we do brief^y show what is spoken, and what should
^olowe, thus. You have heard how he ^ath behaved himself to his country ^ow
what he has been to his parents I will tell you.

Exe^plu^ est rei gestae est co^m^moratio, and ad nostra^ aussa^ acco^modatio.
Huius ergo materia est factu^ el res gesta, ab aliquo homine: Sic, Quem admodu^
^amillus rem Romanam in extremam pernitiem adductam, restituit: Sic Laurentius
lationas literas barbarorum inscitia f^re extinctas, in pristinum nitorem
reuocauit. Porro comparatio ostendie exemplum, quod adductum est, aut simile,
aut dissimile, aut contrarium. Rursum, aut par, aut minus, aut maius. Quod in
similibus quoque efficitur.

Exaumple is the rehearsal of a thing that is done, and applying of it to our
cause. So the ground and matter of an exaumple is an act done of any maune,
thus. As Camillus restored ye Romain common wealth being brought into extreme
ieopardye: So Laurence Ualla brought again into the old pureness, the
Latin toungue, which through ignorance of the Babarians, was almost quite
lost. Further, Comparation shows the exaumple that is brought, either to be
like, unlike, or co^ trary. And again, equal, less, or bigger. Which thing
is also done in parables, or similitudes.

Similitudo est collatio rei mutae, vel inanimat^ ad nostr a^ caussa
accommedata vt, Nauis pro ve^ ^rum ratione velum tollens, aut contrahens, i^
ho^ ^ut illud latus transferens: parabola est, quae docet sapientem tempor^
cedere ae rebus presentibus sese accommodare. Sicut ergo exemplum a facto
hominis, and persona historiae petitur, sic collatio a qualibet re preter
homine^, and preter hominis factum, sumitur.

Similitude is a mete conferring of a dumme thing or that has no life, unto
our purpose, as. A ship lyftyng up, taking down, or turnyng his sails on
this side or that side as the winds blows, is a parable: which techeth a
wise manne to serve the time, and do as the world goes. So than as an
exaumple is taken of the de^e of a man, and of some person in an history: So
a similitude is taken of any thing save of man, or man's act.

Imago minimum differt a similitudine. Vt si dicas Achillem ignis aut solis
instar armis relucentem venisse in p^oelium. Aut alique^ more draconis aut
leonis in hosts insil^isse. Imago est potius quam simili^udo. Du^itur autem
Imago ab ammantis forma: Vt si hominem rapacem ac virulentum depingas similem
^ubatae dr^coni, qui oculis ardentibus, d^ntibus acutis, vnguibus aduncis,
biante rictu, per om^ circumspiciens si quem reperiat, cui possit aliquid mali
faucibus afflare, quem ore attingere, dentibus dissecare, lingua aspergere,
vnguibus dilacerere.

Image very little differs from similitude. As if thou say that Achilles came
into the field in harneys glistryng like fire, or the sun beams: Or that one
flew upon his enemies, like a dragon or lion, it is an image or rese^blance
rather then similitude. And a rese^blance is taken of the fourine of a beast,
as if you will paint out a ravening, or poisonous man like to a crested dragon,
which with burning eyes, sharp teeth, crooked nails gapyng mouth, loking every
where, upon whom he may blow out his poyso^ who^ he may gape at, bite with his
teeth poiso^ with his to^g, tear with his nails.

Oraculum id est dictum ab ore dei exceptu^, vel ex mandato dei prolatum,
qualia sunt omnia fer^ quae in Biblijs dicuntur, and praecipiuntur.

Unto exaumples is referred authority: that is a mete conferring of an other
man's saying or sentence to our cause. The kinds be these.

Sentence, is a saying pertaining to manners, or to common practices of the
world which with proper br^efnes, show eth what is to be done, or wont to be
done in this life, as. Continual labor overcomes al thing. And no man may
hope for any thing against gods will. Such be the se^tences of Salomo^, and
Cato.

Enthymeme, a sentence made of contraries: as if it be a great praise to
please good menue: to be allowed of evil, is great reproach. Also flattry gets
friends, truth hatred. Neither is it here a kind of argume^tacion dialectical

Epiphonema, is an acclamacion of any matter that is told, or allowed: that is
to say, an amplifying of honesty, dign^tie, profit, difficulty, or such
other like, put at the end for the more (...) ling, as. As so w^ightie a
matter it was to set up the Roman nation. Here is an acclamacion of a
matter told before. And so great it is to accustom our self from youth.

An acclamation of a thing that is told thus, as for Ligarius. Caesar, whose per
don is praise of thy mercy, shall there words sharpen thee to cru^?

Noema, when we signifye (...), that which the hearer may coni (...) by
himself. Or it is a taunt, spoken against any person, whose folly, and manners
are reproved. Liuie has such an ^aumple. The Athenians by letters and words
fought against Philip. Whereby, Liuius did secretly reprove the un warlike
babbling of the Grecians.

(...), a very short exposicion of any ^ede or saying, with the autours name
being recited. This is well handled of (...) in the preface of the third book
of his Offices: that Scipio was wont to say, he was never less alone then
when he was void of the common wealth matters, and never less alone, the^
when he was alone.

AEnos, a sayng or a sentence taken out of a tale, as are the Morals and
Alligories interpretyng fables, and showing there use.

Oraculum, any word that is received at the mouth of God, or spoken by his
commanndement, as are commonly all things that are spoken and commanded in
the Bibles.

Expolitio est, c^m in eodem loco manemus, and altud atque aliud dicere
vi^emur. Ergo huiusmodi vehementer ornata poterit ess^ expolitio, quae
constabit exfrequentibus verborum exornationibus, and sententiarum hoc pacto,
Ita vti conte^nendus est, qui i^ n^uiga^do, se, qua^ na^im mouult incolumem:
ita vituperandus, qui in Reip. discrimine, suae plusquam communi saluti,
co^sulit. Naue en^ fracta muli incolumes eu^serunt: exnaufragio patriaesal^us
nemo potest enatare, Quod mihi been videtur. Decius intellexisse, qui se
deuouisse dicitur, and pro legionibus in hosts misisse medios, Un de amisit
vitam, and non perdidit. Re enim vilissima^et paru^, maxima^ i edemit: dedit
vita^, accepi^ patria^, amisit anim^, potitus est gloria, quae cu^su^ma laud
prodita, vetustate quotidie magis ^nitescit.

Expolition is, when we tarry still in one place, and yet seem to speak diverse
things. So that it may be a very good ly expolition, which shall stand of many
exornations of words, and sentences, thus. Wherefore as he is to be despised
which being on the sea had rather have himself safe the^ the ship, so is he to
be re buked which in the ^eopardy of the common wealth, provides more for him
setfe, then for the safety of the common wealth Which thing me thinks D^cius
did well perceive, when he bente himself to die, and for the saving of his
soldiers to have run into the mids of his enemis. Whereby he let his life
go, but he lost it not. For with a small thing and of little: price he
redemedathi^g of great valu^ he gave his life, but he received his country: he
let pass his life, but enjoyed glory, which declared with great praise the
elder it shall wax, daily the more and more it shall shine.

Breuitas est res ipsis tantummodo verbis ne^essariis ex^edita, hoc modo.
Lemnum praterien^ cepit, inde Tharsi presidium resiquit, post, vrbem in
Bythinia sustulit, inde pulsus in Hellespontum statim potitur Abido.

Brevity is, when the matter is quick ly told, with no more words but those
that be necessary, thus. As he passed by, he took Lemnum, then he left a
garriso^ at Tharsus: after he took a city in Bythinia, drieuen from thence,
forthwith he wanne Abydus.

Atque haefere sunt senten^arum figurae: queis rerum, and orationis copia
mirabiliter augetur Ceterum a Rhetoribus appellantur vari^s nominibus, vt a
Fabio alicubi argumenta, quum sun^ parts caussarum, quae omitti commode non
possunt alicubi or namenta, and amplificationum formae, and virtutes orationis,
and lumina, and colorestum videlicet, quum non su^t parts caussarum, (...) vel
eximi, vel omitti possunt; boc est, quando non probandi, sed ornandi gratia
caussis inseruntur. Cicero vocat exornationes sentemiarum A lij nominant
argumenta rerum, quod his non solum orationis, sed and caussae corpus augeatur,
and increscat. Verum quoniam nomina declarandis rebus seruiunt, expositis
rebus, de vocibus non est cur anxij magnopere simus. Haud ignoro esse and alia
pleraque ornamenta, and figuras orationis. Verum nobis precipua sunt pro virili
collecta, and quae ma xime digna annotatu visa.

And these in manner be the figures of sentences, whereby the copye, both of
words and matter, is wonderfully increased. Howbeit they be called of the
Rhetoricians by diverse names, as some where of Qui^tilian they be named ar
gumentes, and manners of amplificatio^, virtues also of an oration, and lights,
and colors, even then in deed when they be not parts of the matter, but
either may be taken out, or quite left of: that is to say, when they be not put
in matters, to prove any thing, but to garnish it. Cicero calls them
exornations of sentence. Other name them orname^tes of matter, because by them,
not only the oration and words, but the body of the matter grows and is
increased. But because names do serve to declare things, the matters
declared, we need not to take much thought touching the words. I know there
be many other ornaments also, and figures of oracion But to my power I have
gathered the chief, and that were thought most mete to be noted.

De Tribus Generibus dicendi.
COmmonstratis de ornatu, and Eloquutione praeceptis, atque figuris, reliquae
muneris, ac instituti nostri parts erunt, vt in quibus omnis or atoria
institutio, debeat esse generibus, dicamus. Es se enim diuersa dicendi genera,
quae Graeci(...), nos figuras appellamus, in quibus omnis oration non vitiosa
consumitur, neminem arbitror ne mediocriter quidem doctum, fugit, (...) tot
artium scriptores, and Grecos, and Latinos, quos priora seeula tulerunt,
stylum, dicendique genus orationis plerunque dispar, atque dissimile sequutos,
vid^us. Sunt autem dicendi (...) tria potissimum animaduersa, Grande, Tenue,
Mediocre, Grande, illustre, vehemens, and plenum dicendi genus, diuino quod^
genere orationis, atque incredibili, caussis grauioribus ad hibetur: Habet enim
cum am^a matestate, ornatissima verba, propria; translata, extranea, ita tame^,
vt ad vnamquanquam rem acco^modata sint: and graves sententias, quae in
amplificatione, and co^ miseratione tractantur, and exornationes cum verborum,
tum sente^tiarum, quibus maximam vim in or ationibus tribuunt, ac grauitatem.
Sunt autem qui hoc genere vtuntur, vehementes, varij, copiosi, graves, ad
permouendos, and conuertendos animos instructi, and parati. Vsus est Ciecro in
oratione pro Aulo Cluentio, pro Sylla, pro ^ito Annio Milone, pro Caio Rabirio,
in Catilinam, in Verre^, in Pisonem, Sed huius imperiti sepe in vitia incidunt,
cum grauis oration illis videtur (...), que turget, and inflata est:quae nouis,
aut duriter a^unde translatis, aut priscis, and ab vs^ quotidtani sermo nis iam
(...), aut grauioribus quam res postulat verbis, vtitur hoc modo. Nam qui
perduellionibus venditat patriam, non satis suppl^ dederet, si preceps in
Neptunias ^pultus erit Lacunas.

Tenue genus dicendi, subtili quada^ and pr^ssa, atque (...) oratione fertur,
caussis pa^lo acutioribus, quam in vsu, vulgari sermonis versantur, est
accommodatum. Est enim gaenus or ationis demissum, vsque ad vsitassimam puri,
dilucid^ue consuetudinem sermonis: habet sententias tenues, subtiles, acutas,
omnia docentes, and diluci diora, non ampliora, facientes. In eodemque genere
(vt in oratore (...)) alij callidi sunt, sed impoliti, et consulto rudium
si^les, and imperitorum: alij in eadem ieiunitate concinniores, id est, faceti,
floren tes etiam, and leniter ornati. Vsus est Cicero in phi losophi^is
disputationibus, in or atione pro Quintio, pro Rosco Comedo, and Terentius and
Plautus in suis Comoedus, Errant, qui non possunt in illa facetissima verborum
attenuatione commode versari, and veniunt ad aridum, and exangue gaenus
orationis, quod non alienum est exile nominari, cuius modi est. Namistic ad
balneas accessit, ad hunc postea dixit: Hic tuus seruus me pulsauit. Posteae
dixit hic illi, Considerabo, Post ille conuicium fecit, and magis, magisque
presentibus multis clamauit.

Mediocre and temperatum dicendi gaenus ex hu (...), neque tamen ex infima, and
pervulgatissima verborum and sententiarum dignitate, co^stat. Estque recte
dictum genus sermonis temperatum quod admodum vicinum sit tenui, and grandi:
atque ita (...) in neutro excellat, sed vtriusque sit par ticeps, v^l potius
expers, cum neque hoc, neque illud haebeat, sed interiectam, moderationem
persequatur, atque temperie. Idque vno tenore, vt aiunt in dicendo fluit, nihil
preter facultatem afferens and aequalitatem, omnemque orationem orname^tis
modicis cum verborum, tum s^ntentiarum distin guens. Vtitur eo Cicero in
oratione pro lege Manilia, pro Aulo Cecinna, pro Marco Marcello, (...) ximeque
in Libris Ofsiciorum. In hoc ^itiosum est, peruenire ad co^fine genus eius,
quod fluctuans and dissolutum appeliant, eo quod sine neruis, and articulis,
fluctuet huc and illuc, nec possit confirmare, nec viriliter sese expedire, id
est huiusmodi. Socij nostri cum belliger are nobiscum vell^t, (...) ratiocinati
essent etiam atque etiam quid possent facere siquidem sua sponte facerent, and
non habe rent hic auditores multos, and malos homines and audaces solent enim
diu cogitare omnes, qui mag na negotia volunt agere. Non potest ^smodi ser mo
tenere attentum auditorem. Difflluit enim to tus, neque quiequam comprehendens
perfectis verbis amplectitur.

Of the three kinds of style or endighting.
Now yt we have showed the (...) and figures of garnishing, and eloquntio^, it
is our office and duty, to show in what kinds, al oratorie ought to be. For
that there be three sundry kinds called of the Greeks Characters, of us,
figures, in which every oration not fawtie, is occupied, I trow there is no
man meanly learned, but he knows: namelye when we se so many writers of
sciences, both Grecians, and Latins, which have been before time, to have
followed for the most part sundry kinds of writing, one unlike the other. And
there has been marked inespeciall three kinds of endighting. The great, the
small, and the mean.

The great kind.
The great, the noble, the mighty, and the full kind of endighting, with an
incredible, and a certain divine power of oration is used in (...) causes: for
it has with an ample (...), very garnyshed words: proper, translated, and
(...) (...) tences, which are handled in amplificatio^, and (...): and it has
crornati (...) both of words and se^te^ces: where unto in orations they
ascribe very great strength and gravity. And they that use this kind be
vehement, various, copious, grave, well and thoroughly appointed, to move and
turn men to their purpose This kind did Cicero use in the orati on for Aulus
Cluencius, for Sylla, for Titus Annius Milo, for Caius (...), against Catiline,
against Uerres against Piso, but they that cannot skyll of this, oftentimes fall
into fautes, when unto the^ yt seems a grave oration, which swells and is
puffed up, which uses strange words, hardly translated, or that be to old,
and that be now long sythens left of from use of daily talk, or more grave
then the thing requires.

The small kind.
The small kind of endightyng is in a subtle, pressed, and fyled oration,
mete for causes that be a little sharper then are in the common use of
speaking. For it is a kind of oration that is let dowue even to the most
used custom of pure, and clear speaking. It has fine sentences, subtilo,
sharp, teaching all things, and making them more plain, not more ample. And
in this same kind (as Cicero says in his orator) some be crafty, but vnpo
lished, and of purpose like the rude and unskillful. Other in yt leanes are
trim, that is, merry co^ceited, flourishing also, and a little garnished. Cicero
used this kind in his philosophical disputacions, in the oration for (...), for
Roscius the comedy player: and Terence, and Plau tus in their Comedies. Such
as cannot handsomely use themselfes in that merry conceited slendernes of words,
fall into a dry, and feeble kind of oration, which may be called aweake, and
feeble writi^g, thus. He came to the balenes: after he said unto him. This thy
servant struck me. I will consider. After that he chode and cried more and more
many being present.

The mean kind.
The mean and temperate kind of in^ stands of the lower, and yet not of the
lowest, and most common words and sentences. And it is rightly called ye
temperate kind of speaking, because it is very nigh unto the small, and to the
great (...), following a moderation and temper betwixt them both. And it follows
(as you would say) in one tenor distinguishing, all the oration with small
ornaments both of words and se^tences. Cicero uses this for the law of
Manilius, for Aulus Cecinna, for Marcus Marcellus, and most of al in his books
of Offices. In this is fawtye to come to the kind that is nie unto it, called
dissolute, because it waueth hither and thither, as it were without synewes and
iointes, standing surely in no point. And such an Oration cannot cause the
hearer to take any head, when it goes in and out, and co^prehendeth not any
thing with perfect words.

FINIS.
THE ARGUMENT OF the oration for Marcus Marcellus.
GNeius Pompeius being overcome in ye bataile at Phar salia, of those men that
took his part, some (...) into Afrike to the army of Juba, and Actius, to
renew the bataile again, as did Scipio and Cato: other thiking themselves
overcome, fought no more, as did Marcus Cicero: some kept a mean, as did
Marcus Marcellus, one that had be^e co^sull, and a singular wise man, which
always did much distrust ye victory of Po^pey. The great multitude for his great
and singular virtues loved this man, and therefore desired y^ he should be
restored. But ye inuin^ible stomach of his would not be restored by Cefar into
his country because he would not se at Rome, those things that grieved his
heart. Cieero be cause he was his familier, and friend even of a child, did
oftentimes exhort him to give place to the time, and obey necessi which is
always the point of a wise man ^is brother Caius Marcellus, most heartily
prayed him that he would come, and continually prayed Caesar for to save his
brother. In the Senate, Caesar being present, when Lucius Piso made mention of
Marcus Marcellns, and when his brother Caius Marcellus had cast himself at the
fete of Caesar, all the Senate rose up toge there, and lowly came to Caesar, to
pardon Marcus Marcellus. Then made Caesar an oration in the Senate, in the which
oration he accused the bitterness of Marcus Marcellus, that when he warred in
Gallia, the^ Marcus Marcelius being co^ sul, called him thief, and that he went
in hand with the counsel, that Caesar should be judged an enmy of his country,
o^les he would put of his armor, and that Mar ^us Marcellus also did beat we
rods the Decurian of Nouumcomu^, (which to be fraunchised Caesar had brought
to Rome) to declare that this ^ecurion was no Citezin, and so to disprove the
deed of Caesar For to beat the Citizens of ^ome with rods it was forbidden by
the law that Portius made, For the Citizens of Rome, both were the^ fraun
thisers, and brought out of other countries, there to enhabite. Beside this he
showed also other displeasures that Marcellus did unto him. ^eahe added that
some there were that lay in wait to kill him. But he said as touching nature I
have lived enough, and as touching glory too. Then suddenly otherwise the^ al
they looked for, as touching Marcellus he said he would not deny it, no not for
his own sake. And so he gave hun to the Senate, and to the common wealth. The
senators being demanded what they thought of his iudgem^t, gave thanks to
Caesar. Cicero which had appointed for the desire of his old dignity, to hold
his peace, moved by Cesars highness of mind, and mercy, and that the Senate did
their duetic, changed his purpose. Therefore in this Oration he gives great
thanks to Caesar. So is this the argum^t. First he shows the cause why he had
determined for ever to hold his peace among the counsaylers: and that Cesars
mercy in restoryng his eitmye Marcellus, was the cause why he changed his
purpose. For then Cesat gave a sign that all should be well in the common
weal. He does prefer Cesars acts before all the acts of the Emperors of
the people of Rome, of outward nations, of most mighty people, and most
ercellente kings. But he says that he has gotten much more glory, because
he has vanquished his own mind, repressed his anger, and tempered his
victory (which by nature is insolent and proud) and because he has restored
his enmy to his old dignity. In this victory so great was Cesars modesty, that
he showed he had rather not to have fought then to have overcome, in that he
restored again, and loved those that counsayled to peace, among the which was
Cicero. If Pompey had overcome, his victory would have been cruel: in the
victory of Caesar there was no cruelty, there was no man killed, but the armed
men in the fight. Wherefore the immortal gods seem to have referred all the
safety of the people of Rome and of the common wealth, to the wisdom and mercy
of Caesar, seeing they have helped his victory. He takes away the suspicion of
Caesar, that any man should lie in wai^ to slay him, but yet he counsels him to
take heed. He denies that he ever feared any such thing to happen to Caesar,
but yet he says the v^certayne happes of life, and frailtye of man's nature to
be feared. He exhorts Caesar to set up again the common wealth, which through
the violence of war needs was decayed. And because Caesar said he had lived
long enough touching nature, and glory: yet says Cicero, that for his
country, for which he was borne, he had lived but a little, which if he will now
set in order again, the glory of his divine virtue shall remayn for ever. He
desires Ce^ar to look to his own life, and safety. He promises in his own
name, and in the name of the rest of the Senators, that they will not only
watch for him, but also put their own bodies in i^opardye to save him.

A THANKS GEVING to Caesar for the restitucion of Marcus Marcellus.
OF this long silence, which I used in these troublous times, not for any
fear, but partly for sorrow, partly for shame, honorable fathers, this
present day has made an end: and made me begin again after mine old manner,
to say my will and mind. For so great mekenes, such mercy as never was heard of,
such moderation where one may do al, finallye such incredible, and in (...)
heavenly wisdom, (...) no wise I may pass over with silence. For Marcus
Marcellus, ho norable fathers, now restored to you, and to the commonwealth, I
think not only his voice and autoritye, but mine own also to be conserved, and
restored again to you and to the commonwealth. For I was sorry honorable
fathers, yea and very sorry, so noble a man, being in the same quarrel y^ I was,
not also to be in as good a case as I am: neither could I find in mine
heart, nor yet think it laweful, A Metaphore.
to run in this your old raze, and sit among you counsaylers, the chyefe
lover of my studyes, and labors, and as it were my fellow, and company^ pulled
away from me. Wherefore Caesar, both haste thou given again unto me mine old
facion of Iyfe, and haste set up to all these men as it were a banner of
hope, that all shall be A tra^slatio^ taken of the manner of mar.
well in the common wealth. For I have perceived in many, chiefly in my self,
and of late in all: sithe thou haste restored Marcellus to the Senators, to
the people, and to the common wealth, specially also rehearsing the greues by
him done unto thee, that thou set more by the reputation of this order, and
honor of the common wealth, then either by thine own sorrows, or suspicions.
And verily of al his life past he has received the gretest fruit, and most
honorit is unto him: that all the Senate has made intercession, and that
besides also, by thy most grave and sage judgment, he thought to do honor to
thee and to the common wealth, Whereby ve An Epipho neme to the praise of
Marcellu^
rely thou do perceive, yt since in recey uing the benefit it is so great
praise, how much more glorious it is to the to have given it. In deed happy is
he, for whose saftie, no less gladness in manner comes to all men, then to
himself. And this he well deserves. For who is more excellent the^ he, in

kind of thing worthy praise? No man's wit is so great, no man so h^ ble either

gattest greater praise the thou have this day. I am often wont to remember,
and gladly much to speak of, how that all the acts of our Emperors, of
foreign nations, of most mighty people, of most noble kings, are not worthy
to be compared with thine, neither for the greatness of the quarrel, neither in
number of battles, neither in diversity of countries, nor in spedy
perfourmance, nor in diversities of fightes: and that no countries, were they
never so far distaunt, would more quickly be gone unto on foot, then they
were made famous I will not say with thy spedy iourneys, but victories. which
things verily except I would confess to be so great, y^ scarce any man's mind,
or thought were able to comprehend them, I might worth^ly be counted witles. And
yet for all that, there be other things much greater. For as touching y^
praises of war, some be wont to (...) them with words, and to pluck them
from the captains, and part the^ with the soldiers that the captains should
not have all. And verily in battle the manhood of the soldiers, the
co^uenience of y^ place, the succors of confiderates, ships, vitailes, and
such other, doo^ help very much: and the greatest part of all Fortune

writings, but in the mouths almost of all nations, and shall b^e spoken of
even to the worlds end. But yet such things, I wotte not how, even while
they be heard, and while they be readde, seem to be allowed with cry of
souldyers, and sound of trumpettes. But ^rely when either we hear or read,
any thing to be done mercifully, mekely, justly, moderately, wisely, in anger
specially, (which is enemy to discretion) and in victory (which of nature is
insolent and proud,) Oh how bend we our herts to it, not only in matters done
in deed, but in feigned also: that often times we love them whom we never saw.
But he whom we see present, whose mind, meaning, and face, we behold,
wylling by thy mercy to save that, that war would have destroyed, how may we
praise thee, how may we love thee, sufficientlye? By my faith ^esar, the
Hyperbol^.
walls of the counsel house me thinks leap for joy, and seem to praise
the, because within them, and in their s^ates, there shall now come again the
woorshippe and authority of our old au^cestours. Uerely when I saw, and so
did you as well as I, the tears of ^aius Marcellus his good and loving brother
fall from his eyes, anon the remembrance of all the Marcelli^ns perced my
heart, which now being dead, by saving Marcellus thou haste restored again to
their old estate, and delivered almost, from utter decay, a very noble house
and family, being now brought to a few. This day therefore thou may
worthily prefer, before al thy most valyant, and innumerable acts. For this
is ^esars praise only: other acts that were done, thou being captein, were
great in deed, but yet a great com pany were partakers thereof. O^ this thou
art both captain and companion: and verelye it is so great, that no time
shall ever end it, as it does other signs and tokens of thy triu^phes and
victories. For there was never thing made by woorkemanshippe and hand, but tune
will mar, and consume it. But this thy ^nitie, and mercy of mind, shall
florishe every day more and more, and tha^ increase by process of time,
where Images s^tte up in tokens of thy victories, by time shall be consumed,
and wasted away. And in deed al other victories of civil battles now before
this, thou haste overcome by equitye and mercy. But this day thou passest
thine own self. I fear lest that, that I will say, cannot be so well

have overcome victory it self, when she by conqueste would have slain,
whom thou by mercy dooest pardon. For where by the propertye of victory, all
we that were overcome, by right should have dyed: by thy judgment of mercy,
now are we saved. Thou then only must be called vnuanquishe^ vy whom, yea the

hear I pray you Al we, which were compelled to arm our felues, I wot not
by what miserable and deadly destenye of the common wealth, although we be in
some fault of mannishe error, yet be we not guilty of any (...) act. For
where, honorable cou^failers, at your intercession, he has saved Marcus
Marcellus for the comm^ wealth, he has restored without any prayer me to my
self, and also to the co^ mon wealth, and other noble men also to themselves,
and to their country, of whom you see a great and honorable company, here
now at this present sessions. He has not brought enemies into the counsels
house, but has declared, the civil war to have been ta ke^ in hand of y^
most part, rather through ignoran^ce, false, and vain fear, the^ covetousness,
or cruelty. In which war I thought it ever best to e^treate of peace; (...)
was sorye, not only peace, but the Oration also of the Citezens crauyng peace
always to be refused. As for me, I never desired this, ne yet any other
civil battles, but always have cou^sailed to peace, and not to war. I
followed Pompey for his frendlinesse toward me, not for any cause that he had
(...) so good to the common wealth. I was not so mad, either for desire, or
hope, willingly and wittingly to run to de stroy my self: only was the
remembrance of a thankful mind great with me. And well known was the
counsel that I ^ue. For both here in this house, when al things were yet well,
and in the time of war also, I was all in one mind, yea even then, when I
was in ieopardy of my life. There is none therefore that will judge so evil,
as to doubt^ of Cesars mind touching war, when straight ways after the
battle, he determined to save the counsaillers to peace, and was angrye with
the other. And this would seem the less marvel peradventure then, when the
(...) was uncertain, and the fortune of battle doubtful. But he that loves
the authors of peace when he has the victory, forsooth declares that he had
rather not to fight, the^ to be victor. And of this I can bear Marcellus
witness. For as always of peace, even like of war also, were we of one mind.
How often, and how sorowfully, did I se him fear, partly the proud statelines
of ce^ tain men, and chiefly the cruelty of victory it self. Wherefore
Caesar, the more acceptable ought thy gentleness to be unto us, which foresawe
the cruelty of the other part. For now must we compare together, not the
causes, but the victories. We have seen thy victory ended with war, and no
sweord drawn in the city, in time of peace. The Citizens that be lost, be
overthrown by battle, not by anger of the victor. So that no man can doubt,
that if it were possible, Caius Caesar would raise again many that be dead,
sith (...) the same army, he saves whom he (...) And of the other part I
will say no more, but that we all feared, the victory would have been to
angrye. For some there were that threatened not only such as were in harness,
but them also that styred never a whit: and that it was to be considered, not
what men thought, but where they were too: in so much me thinks that the
immortal gods, though they would punish the people for some fault, and
have raised up this woeful civil battle, that yet now either pleased, or
once at the last filled: they have turned all to ye ^erey and wisdom of the
eo^querour. Wherefore ^esar, rejoice in this thynae excellent goodness, and be
glad in thy good fortune and praise, and also in thy gentle nature and manners,
whereby great pleasure, and profit comes to a wise man. Other of thy
valiant acts when thou shall remember, although thou may reioy^e in them,
yet for thy happiness thou may be glad: but as often as thou shall think of
us, whom itpleased thee to save, and to have with thee in (...) common wealth,
so often (...) thou think of thy great benefits, incredible liberality, and
singular wisdom, which I may boldlye call, not only excellent good, but
undoubtedly good alone. For in true praise, there is such bryghtnesse, in
nobleness of heart, such honor, that these seem to be given of virtue, the
other (...) of fortune. Be not weary then in saving good men, specially
which have not fallen through ^uyil desire, and leu^nesse, but by well doing
in their opin^on, foolyshe (...), yet not cuyl, but as it were for the common
wealth. For it is not thy fault if some feared thee, and contrary thy great
praise, that some think thee not to be feared at al. Now I come to thy most
grievous com plaint, and suspicio^, which must be warely taken head of, not so
much of thee, as of all ^itizens: us inespecial, who^ thou have saved. And
although I trust it be fal^e, yet will I never make it less by words, then

for? Or is he oue of them, that was in thy bend of soldiers. It is not
credible any to be so mad, that sithe by the he gatte as much good as could
be, he would not set more by thy life, then by his own. Well, ^f thine
own think thee no harm, yet must thou beware of thine enemies? What
enemies? For all that were, either through stubbernes they have lost their
lives, or by thy mercy have their lives, so that either none of thine enemies

do remain, or they that do, be thy very friends. But sith in m^nes minds
be such cor^ers, and farr^ fetches, well let us increase thy suspicion, for
so we shall increase also ou^ dyligence. For who has so little experience, who
is so unskillful of the common weal, who so little thinks upon his own
safetye, or upon all others, which perceyueth not his safegarde to be thine,
and only upon thy life, all other men's wealth to depend? I verelye as I am
bound, thinkyng upon the day and night, fear such chances as happen to
manne, the vncertaine^ happes of healthfulnes, and the frai^tie of our common
nature: and I am sorry, that where the common wealth should be immortal, it
does stand upon the life of one mortal man. But if to those chances of man, and uncertain happes, there be joined a consent of a mischievous
conspiracye, what God, if he would, should we believe to be hable to help the
common wealth? Al must be helped and holden up, by thy hand only ^sar, for
now through the violence of war, all good order is overthrown, and lies
flat on the ground. Process in law must be had again, true dea lyng
must be called again, lecherye must be suppressed, honest generation
increased, all that is slipte away, must be bound up again with stray^
laws. It could not be chosen in (...) great a ^iuile battle, but that the
co^ mon wealth being sore shaken, how so ever the war ended, should lose
many ornaments of her honor, and succors of her suertye: and that the
captains would do many things in war, which they themselves had forbid
in peace. All which wounds of war thou must heal, for beside the no man
can help them. Therefore that most wise and excellent saying of thine. I was
sorye to hear: how that thou had lived long enough both to nature, and
glory. Enough if thou will so have it, paraduenture to nature, and if it please
you, I say also to glory. But to that point that is greatest of all, eue^ for
thy countr^y sake thou have lived but a little. Wherefore leave of I pray the
this wisdom of learned men in despysyng death, be not wise to our harm. For
it often comes unto mine ears that thou speak of this to much, how thou
have lived long enough for thine own part. But the^ would I believe it if thou
did live, but for thy self alone, or else were borne but for thy self
alone: but now sithe thine acts do contain the safety of all the Citizins,
and of all the common wealth, thou art so far of from perfourmaunce of thy
greatest works, that yet thou haste not laid the foundacions thou wenest for.
^ilt thou the^ prescribe an end of thy lyse, not in the sauegard of the common
wealth, but by indiffere^ce of thine own mind? What and if this be not enough,

shall we leave behind us but little glory? yes verily for other, were they never
so many, enough: little, for thee only. For whatsoever it is, though it be
great, surely it is but little then, when there is any thing that is greater.
And if Caesar, this should have been the end of thine immortal acts, that
thine adversaries being overcome, thou should leave the common wealth in
that state, in which now it is: mar^ I pray thee whether that (...)
excellent valiauntnes of thiue, were not more to be meruailed at, then praise

the country, or to all men. This the yet is left, this part remains, in
this must ye labor, to stay and settle the (...) mon wealth, and that thou
chiefly may live joyfully in it, after it is set in great rest, and quietness.
And when both thou have paid thy country that thou owe her, and have
satisfied nature by living at full, then say if thou list, thou have lived long
enough. For what is this that we call long, seeing there is somewhat that is
last? and when that comes, al pleasure past, is as nothing, because
afterward it shall be nothing. Howbeit, this high courage of thine, was (...)
co^te^t to be within these straites, which nature has given us to live, but
was always on fire to live euerlastynglye. Neither is this to be counted thy
life, which is in breath and body: but Caesar, that is thy life, I say, that
is thy life, which shall florishe worlds everlasting, which posterity shall
nourishe, and eternity always behold. For this thou must serve, for this thou
must auaunce thy self: which life now all ready has many things to merueile
at, and looks also, for that she may praise. ^relye they that come after
shall wonder at thine Empires, at thy provinces, how thou made a bridge over
the flood Rhene to come ito Germany, how thou did transport thine army over
the occean into Britain, how thou have joined battle with thine enemies
fiftye times, they will wonder at thine incredible victories, images set up,
great rewards given unto the for thy manlines, tr^phes for thy victories, I
say, theiwil wonder, when they shall hear, and read these things. But except
this city be stablished by thy counsayles, ordinances, and statutes, thy name
shall do no more but wa^der far abroad, no sta ble seat nor certain house
shall it have to dwell in. Among them that shall come after also, there shall be
great dissension as there has been among us: when some shall praise thine
acts above the moon, and some again shall find fault, yea in this point
chief of al, if thou quench not the fire of civil battle, by saving thy
country in so much that thy victory might seem to be ascribed to deste^ye,
the quietness of this city to thy policy and wisdom. Serve therefore those
judges also, which shall judge of the many years herafter, and peradventure
more justly than we. For they shall judge both without love and flattery: and
also without hatred and envy: and although that (as some men think falsely)
shall then nothing perteyne unto the, yet now it does perteine that thou
should be such one, whose praises should never be forgotten, Diverse were the
wills of the Citizens: and diverse was their talk. For we differd not only
why, and wherefore we should fight, but also with whom, and on whose side we
should fight, But there was a doubt, and a variaunce among the noblest
capteins. Many doubted what was best to be done, many what was good for
themselves, many what was comely, and some also what was lawful. The common
wealth is past this miserable, and fatal battle: he has overcome, which
by his good fortune will not increase hatred, but by his goodness appease it:
nor will not judge al the^ whom he was angry with, either woorthye of
^anishmente, or of death. Some have laid down there weapons, from some they have
been taken away. He is bnkind, and unjust, which being delivered from the
peril of harnes, will yet keep an harnest mind: so that he is better which died
i^ the field, the^ he that shed his blood in mainteinyng the qua rel. For some
shall think yt to be stubbernes, which to other may seem constance But because
now all dissension is broken by battle, and put out by gentleness of the
victor: it remains that all, which eth^r be be wise, or in their wits, should
be all of one mind. For except thou be safe, Caesar, and be in that mind; in
which before thou have been, and art at this day most of al, we cannot be
saved. Wherefore al we, which would all were well, both exhort the, and heartily
pray the, to have regard to thy life, and al we, (to speak also for other that
I think of my self,) because thou think there is some privy matter that
thou ought to be ware of, I say, we do promise, not only to watch, and
ward for thy safeguard, but eue^ to set our own sides and bodies against thine
enemies. But to end there as I began, Caesar, we al give the most hearty thanks
in words, and in our hearts be more bound unto the. For yt we be al of one
mind, thou maiste perceive by the prayers, and wepinges of us al. But because
it needs not, each man that stands here should speak, they would that I
should tell the tale, which in mauer of necessity must do it, both because
their will, and pleasure so is, and because thou have restored again Marcus
Marcellus to the senate, to the peo ple, and to the commonwealth: therefore I
perceive, that chiefly I ought to do this thing. For I see all men rejoice, not
for the safety of one man, but as it were eu^ for the life of us all. As
touching my great good will toward him, which al m^ have so known, that scasely
his good, and loving brother Caius Marcellus has loved him better: seeing I
showed it by taking thought, care, and pain, so long as it was in doubt
whether he should live, or not, verily now at this time, being delivered from
care, grief, and so rows, Iought to show this my b^uo lence a great deal
much more. Therefore Caesar, I give thee thanks, not only for y^ thou have
conscrued me to all my goods, but also have set me in more honor than ever I
was before, and to these thine innumerable benefits toward me, (when I
thought it impossible that any more might be done) yet by this thy deed haste
increased thy goodness, and heaped up thy gentleness upon me more and more,
with thy gracious favor continuallye.
