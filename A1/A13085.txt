A most true Discourse, declaring the life and death of one Stubbe Peeter,
being a most wicked Sorcerer.
THose whom the Lord does leave to follow the Imagination of their own
hearts, dispising his proffered grace, in the end through the hardness of heart
and contempt of his fatherly mercy, they enter the right path to perdicion and
destruction of body and soul for ever: as in this present history in perfect
sort may be seen, the strangenes whereof, together with the cruelties
committed, and the long time therein continued, may drive many in doubt whether
the same be truth or no, and the ratherfore that sundry falce and fabulous
matters have heertofore passed in print, which has wrought much incredulity
in ye hearts of all men generally, insomuch that now a days few things do
escape be it never so certain, but that it is embased by the term of a lie or
falce report. In the reading of this story, therefore I do first request
reformation of opinion, next patience to peruse it, because it is published for
examples sake, and lastly to censure thereof as reason and wisdom does think
convenient, considering the subtilty that Satan uses to work the souls
destruction, and the great matters which the accursed practice of Sorcery does
effect, the fruits whereof is death and destruction for ever, and yet in all
ages practiced by the reprobate and wicked of the earth, some in one sort, and
some in another even as the Devil gives promise to perform. But of all
other that ever lived, none was comparable unto this helhound, whose tyranny
and cruelty did well declare he was of his Father the devil, who was a
murderer from the beginning, whose life and death and most bloody practices the
discourse following does make just report. In the towns of Cperadt and
Bedbur near unto Collin in high Germany, there was continually brought up and
nourished one Stubbe Peeter, who from his youth was greatly inclined to evil,
and the practicing of wicked Arts even from twelve years of age till twentye,
and so forwards till his dying day, insomuch that surfeiting in the Damnable
desire of magic, negromancye, and sorcery, acquainting him self with many
infernal spirits and feendes, insomuch that forgetting ye God that made him,
and that Savior that shed his blood for man's redemption: In the end, careless
of salvation gave both soul and body to the devil for ever, for small carnal
pleasure in this life, that he might be famous and spoken of on earth, though
he lost heaven thereby. The Devil who has a ready ear to listen to the
lewd motions of cursed men, promised to give unto him whatsoever his heart
desired during his mortal life: whereupon this vilde wretch neither desired
riches nor promotion, nor was his fancy satisfied with any external or outward
pleasure, but having a tiramous heart, and a most cruel bloody mind, he only
requested that at his pleasure he might woork his malice on men, Women, and
children, in the shape of some beast, whereby he might live without dread or
danger of life, and unknown to be the executor of any bloody enterprise, which
he meant to commit* The Devil who saw him a fit instrueme^t to perfourm
mischief as a wicked feend pleased with the desire of wrong and destruction,
gave unto him a girdle which being put about him, he was straight transfourmed
into the likeness of a greedy devouring Woolf, strong and mighty, with eyes
great and large, which in the night sparkeled like unto brandes of fire, a
mouth great and wide, with most sharp and cruel teeth, A huge body, and
mighty paws: And no sooner should he put off the same girdle, but presently
he should appear in his former shape, according to the proportion of a man, as
if he had never been changed.

Stubbe Peeter heerwith was exceedingly well pleased, and the shape fitted his
fancye and agreeed best with his nature* being inclined to blood and crueltye,
therefore satisfied with this strange and devilish gift, for that it was not
troublesome nor great in carriage, but that it might be hidden in a small room,
he proceeded to the execution of sundry most heinous and vilde murders, for if
any person displeased him, he would incontinent thirst for revenge, and no
sooner should they or any of theirs walk abroad in the feeldes or about the
City, but in the shape of a Woolfe he would presentlye encounter them, and
never rest till he had plucked out their throats and tear their joints a
sunder: And after he had gotten a taste heerof, he took such pleasure and
delight in shedding of blood, that he would night and day walk the Feelds, and
work extreme cruelties. And sundry times he would go through the Streets of
Collin, Bedbur, and Cperadt, in comely habit, and very ciuilly as one well
known to all the inhabitants therabout, and oftentimes was he saluted of those
whose friends and children he had buchered, though nothing suspected for the
same. In these places, I say, he would walk up and down, and if he could spy
either Maid, Wife or child, that his eyes liked or his heart lusted after, he
would wait their issuing out of ye City or town, if he could by any means
get them alone, he would in the feeldes rauishe them, and after in his Wooluish
likeness cruelly murder them: yea often it came to pass that as he walked
abroad in the feeldes, if he chaunste to spy a company of maidens playing
together, or else a milking of their Kine, in his Wooluishe shape he would
incontinent run among them, and while the rest escaped by flight, he would be
sure to lay hold of one, and after his filthy lust fulfilled, he would murder
her presentlye, beside, if he had liked or known any of them, look who he had
a mind unto, her he would pursue, whether she were before or behind, and take
her from the rest, for such was his swiftnes of foot while he continued a
woolf: that he would outrunne the swiftest greyhound in that Country: and so
much he had practiced this wickedness, that ye whole Province was feared by the
cruelty of this bloody and devouring Woolfe. Thus continuing his diuelishe and
damnable deeds within the compass of few years, he had murdered thirteen
young Children, and two goodly young women big with Child, tearing the Children
out of their wombes, in most bloody and sauedge sort, and after eat their
hearts panting hot and raw, which he accounted dainty morsells and best
agreeing to his Appetite.

Moreover he used many times to kill Lambs and Kiddes and such like beasts,
feeding on the same most usually raw and bloody, as if he had been a natural
Woolfe indeed, so that all men mistrusted nothing less then this his devilish
Sorcerie.

He had at that time living a fair young Damsel to his Daughter, after whom
he also lusted most unnaturally, and cruellye committed most wicked inceste
with her, a most groce and vilde sin, far surmounting Adultrye or
Fornication, though the least of the three does drive the soul into hell
fire, except hartye repentance, and the great mercy of God. This Daughter of
his he begot when he was not altogether so wickedlye given, who was called by
the name of Stubbe Beell, whose beautye and good grace was such as deserved
commendacions of all those that knew her: And such was his inordinate lust and
filthye desire toward her, that he begat a Child by her, daily using her as
his Concubine, but as an insaciate and filthy beast, given over to woork evil,
with greedines he also lay by his own Sister, frequenting her company long
time even according as the wickedness of his heart lead him: Moreover being on a
time sent for to a Gossip of his there to make merry and good cheer, ere he
thence departed he so wunne the woman by his fair and flattering speech, and
so much prevailed, yt ere he departed the house: he lay by her, and ever after
had her company at his command, this woman had to name Katherine Trompin, a
woman of tall and comely stature of exceeding good favor and one that was well
esteemed among her neighbors. But his lewd and inordinat lust being not
satisfied with the company of many Concubines, nor his wicked fancye contented
with the beauty of any woman, at length the devil sent unto him a wicked
spirit in the similitude and likeness of a woman, so fair of face and comelye
of personage, that she resembled rather some heavenly Hellin then any mortal
creature, so far her beauty exceeded the chiefest sort of women, and with
her as with his hearts delight, he kept company the space of seven years,
though in the end she proved and was found indeed no other then a she Devil,
notwithstanding, this lewd sin of lecherye did not any thing assuage his
cruel and bloody mind, but continuing an insatiable bloodsucker, so great was
the joy he took therein, that he accounted no day spent in pleasure wherein he
had not shed some blood not respecting so much who he did murder, as how to
murder and destroy them, as the matter ensuing does manifest, which may stand
for a special note of a cruel and hard heart. For having a proper youth to his
son, begotten in the flower and strength of his age, the first fruit of his
body, in whom he took such joy, that he did commonly call him his Hearts
ease, yet so far his delight in murder exceeded the joy he took in his only
Son, that thirsting after his blood, on a time he enticed him into the
feeldes, and from thence into a Forest hard by, where making excuse to stay
about the necessaries of nature, while the young man went on forward,
incontinent in the shape and likeness of a Walfe he encountered his own Son,
and there most cruelly slew him, which done, he presently eat the brains out
of his head as a most sauerie and dainty delycious mean to staunch his greedye
apetite: the most monstrous act that ever man heard off, for never was known a
wretch from nature so far degenerate.

Long time he continued this vilde and villainous life, sometime in the likeness
of a Woolfe, sometime in the habit of a man, sometime in the Towns and
Cities, and sometimes in the Woods and thickettes to them adjoining, whereas
the duche coppye makes mention, he on a time met with two men and one woman,
whom he greatly desired to murder, and the better to bring his devilish purpose
to effect, doubting by them to be ouermatched and knowing one of them by name,
he used this policy to bring them to their end. In subtle sort he conuayed
himself far before them in their way and craftily couched out of their sight,
but as soon as they approached near the place where he lay, he called one of
them by his name, the party hearing him self called once or twice by his
name, supposing it was some familier friend that in jesting sort stood out of
his sight, went from his company toward the place from whence the voice
proceeded, of purpose to see who it was, but he was no sooner entered within the
danger of this transformed man, but incontinent he was murdered in yt place,
the rest of his company staying for him, expecting still his return, but
finding his stay over long: the other man left the woman, and went to look
him, by which means the second man was also murdered, the woman then seeing
neither of both return again, in heart suspected that some evil had fallen
upon them, and therefore with all the power she had, she sought to save her
self by flight, though it nothing prevailed, for good soul she was also soon
overtaken by this light footed Woolfe, whom when he had first deflowred, he
after most cruelly murdered, the men were after found mangled in the wood, but
the woman's body was never after seen, for she the caitife had most rauenoullye
devoured, whose flesh he esteemed both sweet and dainty in taste.

Thus this damnable Stubbe Peeter lived the term of five and twenty years,
vususpected to be Author of so many cruel and unnatural murders, in which
time he had destroyed and spoiled an unknown number of Men, Women, and
Children, sheep, Lambs, and Goats: and other Catttell, for when he could not
through the warines of people draw men, Women, or Children in his danger, then
like a cruel and tirannous beast he would work his cruelty on brut beasts in
most sauadge sort, and did act more mischief and cruelty then would be
credible, although high Germany has been forced to taste the truth thereof.

By which means the inhabitants of Collin, Bedbur and Cperadt, seeing
themselves so grievously endaungered, plagued, and molested by this greedy and
cruel Woolfe, who wrought continual harm and mischief, insomuch that few or
none durst travel to or from those places without good provision of defense,
and all for fear of this devouring and fierce woolf, for oftentimes the
Inhabitants found the Arms and legs of dead Men, Women, and Children,
scattered up and down the feelds to their great grief and vexation of heart,
knowing the same to be done by that strange and cruel Woolfe, whom by no
means they could take or overcome, so that if any man or woman mist their
Child, they were out of hope ever to see it again alive, mistrusting straight
that the Woolfe had destroyed it.

And here is to be noted a most strange thing which sets forth the great
power and merciful providence of God to ye comfort of each Christian heart.
There were not long ago certain small Children playing in a Medowe together
hard by y^ town, where also some store of kine were feeding, many of them
having young calves sucking upon the^: and suddenly among these Children comes
this vilde Woolfe running and caught a prittie fine Girl by the choler, with
intent to pull out her throat, but such was ye will of God, that he could not
pearce the choler of the Childs coat, being high and very well stiffened and
close claspt about her neck, and therewith all the sudden great cry of the
rest of the children which escaped, so amazed the cattle feeding by, that
being fearful to be robbed of their young, they altogether came running
against the Woolfe with such force that he was presently compelled to let go
his hold and to run away to escape ye danger of their horns, by which means
the Child was preserved from death, and God be thanked remains living at this
day.

And that this thing is true, Master Tice Artine a Brewer dwelling at
Puddlewharfe, in London, being a man of that Country borne, and one of good
reputation and account, is able to justify, who is near Kinsman to this
Child, and has from thence twice received Letters conserning the same, and
for that the first Letter did rather drive him into wondering at the act then
yielding credit thereunto, he had shortly after at request of his writing
another letter sent him, whereby he was more fully satisfied, and diverse other
persons of great credit in London has in like sort received letters from
their friends to the like effect.

Likewise in the towns of Germany aforesaid continual prayer was used unto
god that it would please him to deliver the^ from the danger of this greedy
Woolfe.

And although they had practiced all the means that men could devise to take
this ravenous beast, yet until the Lord had determined his fall, they could
not in any wise prevail: notwithstanding they daily continued their purpose,
and daily sought to entrap him, and for that intent continually maintained
great mastyes and Dogs of much strength to hunt and chase the beast
whersoeuer they could find him. In the end it pleased God as they were in
readiness and provided to meet with him, that they should espy him in his
wooluishe likeness, at what time they beset him round about, and most
circumspectlye set their Dogs upon him, in such sort that there was no means
to escape, at which advantage they never could get him before, but as the Lord
delivered Goliath into ye hands of David, so was this Woolfe brought in danger
of these men, who seeing as I said before no way to escape the imminent
danger, being hardly pursued at the heels presently he slipped his girdle from
about him, whereby the shape of a Woolfe clean avoided, and he appeered
presently in his true shape and likeness, having in his hand a staff as one
walking toward the City, but the hunters whose eyes was steadfastly bent upon
the beast, and seeing him in the same place metamorphosed contrary to their
expectation: it wrought a wonderful amazement in their minds, and had it not
been that they knew the man so soon as they saw him, they had surely taken
the same to have been some Devil in a man's likeness, but for as much as they
knew him to be an ancient dweller in the Town, they came unto him, and
talking with him they brought him by communication home to his own house, and
finding him to be the man indeed, and no selusion or fantastical motion,
they had him incontinent before the Maiestrates to be examined.

Thus being apprehended, he was shortly after put to the rack in the Town of
Bedbur, but fearing the torture, he volluntarilye confessed his whole life, and
made known the villainies which he had committed for the space of xxv. years,
also he confessed how by Sorcery he procured of the Devil a Girdle, which
being put on, he forthwith became a Woolfe, which Girdle at his apprehension
he confessed he cast it off in a certain Uallye and there left it, which when the
Maiestrates heard, they sent to the Uallye for it, but at their coming found
nothing at al, for it may be supposed that it was gone to the devil from whence
it came, so that it was not to be found. For the Devil having brought the
wretch to all the shame he could, left him to endure the torments which his
deeds deserved.

After he had some space been imprisoned, the maiestrates found out through
due examination of the matter, that his daugh ter Stubbe Beell and his Gossip
Katherine Trompin, were both accessarye to diverse murders committed, who for
the same as also for their leaud life otherwise committed, was arraigned, and
with Stubbe Peeter condemned, and their several Judgments pronounced the 28
of October 1589* in this manor, that is to say: Stubbe Peeter as principal
mallefactor, was judged first to have his body laid on a wheel, and with red
hot burning pincers in ten several places to have the flesh pulled off from the
bones, after that, his legs and Arms to be broken with a wooden Are or
Hatchet, afterward to have his head struck from his body, then to have his
carcass burnde to Ashes.

Also his Daughter and his Gossip were judged to be burned quick to Ashes, the
same time and day with the carcass of the aforesaid Stubbe Peeter, And on the
31. of the same month, they suffered death accordingly in the town of Bedbur
in the presence of many peers and princes of Germany.

Thus Gentle Reader have I set down the true discourse of this wicked man Stub
Peeter, which I desire to be a warning to all Sorcerers and Witches, which
unlawfully follow their own devilish imagination to the utter ruin and
destruction of their souls eternally, from which wicked and damnable practice,
I beseech God keep all good men, and from the crueltye of their wicked hearts.

Amen.
AFter the exeution, there was by the advice of the Maiestrates of the town of
Bedbur a high pole set up and stronglye framed, which first went through ye
wheel whereon he was broken, whereunto also it was fastened, after that a
little above the Wheel the likeness of a Woolfe was framed in wood, to show
unto all men the shape wherein he executed those cruelties. Over that on the
top of the stake the sorcerers head it self was set up, and round about the
Wheel there hung as it were sixteen pieces of wood about a parde in length
which represented the sixteen persons that was perfectly known to be murdered
by him. And the same ordained to stand there for a continual monument to all
ensuing ages, what murders by Stub Peeter was committed, with the order of his
Judgment, as this picture does more plainelye express. Witnesses that this is
true.
