Prove. 10. 7. LONDON, Printed by E. G. for Joyce Norton and Ric. Whitakers, at
the Sign of the Kings Arms in Saint Paul's Church yard, 1638.

To my honored Friend Anthony Percivall Esquire. Captain of Arcliff Bulwark near
Dover: Comptroller of his Majesty's Customs for Kent, etc.
Sir,
I do at your request venture this rough draught to the public view; being
more confident of good men's acceptance, than fearful of others rash censure: I
had rather the busy should question my ability, than the just my will to serve
my friends: in which office he is not blameworthy, who cannot though he would,
but he that will not though he can. The subject is accommodate to comfort
concerning the deceased, in whose lives we found these marks (the blessed are
not lost, but gone before us: 2. Sam. 12. 23.
I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me, said David of his good
child, the evil he bitterly bewailed) and to inform us what is
Blessedness, lest in the pursuit of the false, we miss the true. None envy
the dead a convenient tomb: no good man will, these kind of monuments, which
equally preserve the memory of the Saints departed, and more profitably, than
the most curious Epitaphs instruct the surviving: I have supplied some things
which time straightened in the delivery. The Lord so direct and assist us in the
use of his ordinance, that when these days of sin are ended. we may attain
the end of our hopes, jalvation and eternal happiness in the world to come,
through our most blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. In whom I am

Your faithful friend I. READING.

Characters of true Blessedness.
1. Unity with God and his Church. 2. Constant praising of God in every estate.
3. Confidence and Trust in God, 4. Sincerity of heart toward the ways of God.
CHARACTERS of True Blessedness, etc.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will still be praising thee,
Selah.

Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are the ways of
them,

Psalm. 84. 4. 5.
COncerning the scope of this Psalm* there are some different opinions among
divines: some refer this blessedness to the Pis^ator after R. Kimhi.
Priests and Levites ministering in the tabernacle: Lyra citat doctores Hebr.
others say, it expresses the desire of Israel in captivity, to return and
repair the temple. Musoulus, Fabritius and Calvin.
Some refer it to David's zeal and desire to return (from the exile to which
Saul or Absolon had driven him) to the tabernacle and public worship of God.
H^n Ains worth in Psalm. Psaltes a sacris coe^ibus exulans, desiderium suum
exponit: p^^rum in ecclesia conversantium faeluitatem explicat^^^un.
Others, near to that, say that the Prophet longing for the communion of the
Sanctuary, shows how blessed they are that dwell therein. Vid^lurj ^ihi q^od
magis exprimat desideri^m sanctorum adhkc in ha^ valle m seriae deg^n^ium
deveniendi ad ^a^d u^ super ^o^^m civi^^m, ^yra
Lyra is more general: it seems to him, that it sets out the desire of
the Saints (yet living in this vale of misery) to attain the joys of heaven.
Neither does Ergo in p^e^^uris (...).
Saint Augustine seem to be of other judgment, who having discoursed of the
tribulations and pressures of the Saints in this life, concludes, Therefore
when we are under the weights of tenta^i^ns set us sound out this voice, and
send out our desires before us, how amiable are thy dwelling places, O Lord of
hosts? certainly those Levites were a Church representative, and a type of the
whole, who being a 1 Pet. 2 9 Exodus 19. 6. Rev. 5 10. Rev. 8. ^3, 4.
royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, do now daily appear before God with our
incense of Prayers, and shall join in one heavenly quire before his throne, to
which our present assembling in his public service, does now tune and prepare
us. So that this Psalm may seem written, not only for the holy Penman thereof
Fsal. 42. 1, 2.
who loved and longed to return to the Tabernacle, public service, and people
of God, but also for their use, whose hearts are by the same spirit touched
with a reverend love of Gods house and service, through which their faith
looks on the state of glory and blessed life to come.

The title of this Psalm (as of the 80.) is commonly given, Vulgar and Vatab.
ad torcularia.
ad torcularia, Augusi. pro torcularibus. (...), ad praecinendum super
torcularibus. Musculus
or pro torcularibus, for the wine-presses. (...). torcular, aut instrumentum
musicum torculari aut vindem^ae adh b^r^ ^olitum. ^sal. 8. 1. Targ. Cy^hara

The word has two significations: it signifies either a wine press, or
musical instrument, (...) the Gittith, or kind of instrument which David
brought with him from Gath. Eo quod isle Psalmus proprie ^antabat^r in medio
Sept^m. collect^s vindemiis -- and in figuram collection^s Sanctorumin-regno
coeloru^. Lyra.
Lyra gives this reason: This Psalm was (says he) wont to be sung about the
middle of September, when they had gathered their grapes to the press. Deuteronomy.
16. 13, 14. Levit. 23. 34. for a figure of the gathering together the Saints,
by Gods great harvesters, the Angels, into the kingdom of heaven: and
therefore this was a feast of great joy and rejoicing. Deuteronomy. 16. 14, 15. as
that shall be to the Elect.

This Psalm has two parts: The first shows, that eternal Blessedness is
desirable above all things in this world. The second shows how we must attain
it; by loving and frequenting Gods house.

Blessed are they: truly blessed, how ever the beguiled world account.

That dwell in thy house, by a Synechdoche, the house of God is put for the
whole Church, whether assembling in the 1 Samuel 1. 3
tabernacle in Shiloh, or 1 Chronicles. 21. 29.
Gibeon, the temple at Jerusalem, or wherever now the holy word of God
sounds, and the Sacraments are truly administered in the society of Saints.

They will still be praising thee: Declaring thy mercies, and living to thy
glory.

Selah. We read this word only in the Psalms, and thrice in Habakkuk.
Iuni^s and Tremel.
Some give it sum, or plane: the Chalde Paraphrase, iugiter, perpetuo. The
Greeks express it by (...), (...). S^idas.
which seems to be that which we call a change of Or as chrys^st. p^oem. in
Psalm, thinks, an ant^phony.

Some think it imports, certitudinens and veritatem. John Foster follows
R. Abraham, Ben Ez^ra and Burgensis, addit. 3. super Psalm* 46. Tantum ad
supplend^m modulamen cant^^, est d^ctio e^^lytica, seu paragogica. b.
that it is put only to supply the song (as other syllables in the Psalms)
carmini^ gratia. Vt diligenti meditatio^e expende^et quod p^^ec^ssisset.
Av^narius.
Some take it for a sign of the voices exaltation, so as that the mind might
have time to be elevated to a serious consideration of that which was sung: to
which opinion I willingly subscribe: if you will, add, that it now imports
the same to the Reader, and as a mark of some excellent matter there written,
Whose strength is in thee: cuius susceptin abste. August. Lyra gives it, Cuius
auxili um est a te: for, nec hom^ nec al^qua creatura potest constq^^
beat^tudin^ ultimam per (...) naturalia. Th. Aq^in. 1. 2. ^. 5 a. 5. c.
attaining of true Blessedness exceeds all power of the creature --
fortitudo ei in te; Montanus. quorum robur in te situm est, all to the same
purpose.

In whose heart are the ways of them, or thy ways. It imports a
consideration of their ways, to which they are exhorted, Hag. 1. 5. which the
wicked seldom do, but run on headlong to destruction: or because their ways
are put for Gods ways, which they go, and not their own; hence it is said
their ways, or the ways of them (the blessed Saints) are in their hearts.
High ways are in their hearts, that is, those which lead them to thy
Tabernacle, as some interpret: Ascen siones in cord suo disposuit-Vulg. Lyra.
etc.
the Vulgar has it, he has disposed ascensions in his heart: ^ following the
Septuagint herein. (...). 70
Vatablus interprets, in quorum cordibus semitae tu^e, that is, who think of
nothing else, but how they may come to thee. Take these Ascensions for the
degrees of virtues, by which we must go to heaven, or for the holy flights of
thoughts into Gods presence, by faithful prayer and meditation, take these
(...) literally, for the high ways which lead to the house of God, and
spiritually for that same Via regni, knowledge of Gods word and sanctity, as
it is taken I^ai. 40 3 Isai. ^5. 8. The way shall be called holy* the polluted
shall not pass by it, and all may be easily reconciled, the sense being like
that, Psalm. 1, 1. 2. Blessed is the man that does not walk in the counsel of
the wicked -- but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law does
he meditate day and night.

For parts observe,

First, the state and condition of those who serve the Lord, They are blessed.

Secondly, the description of them by their Characters.

1. Unity with God and his Church, that dwell in thy house.

2. Practice, they will still be praising thee.

3. Confidence, whose strength is in thee.

4. Sincerity, In whose heart are thy ways.

Blessed are the servants of God: yea as it is here (...) doubly blessed, terque
quaterque beati: unspeakably blessed, because 1 Cor. 6. 9.
eye has not seen, nor heart conceived the extent of their blessedness, that
which God has prepared for them that love him: yet are they upon undoubted
Deteflimonio minime d^bitandum est. Sufficit enim beat^ lingua quae dixit,
sicut scriptum est. Theodoret in 1 Cor. 2. 9.
record, (as it is written --) and God has revealed them to us by his Spirit,
which searches all things, Illud, (...), non pro ignoratiose, sed pro persecta
cognitio^e posuit. ib. Theodar.
not as doubting, but as knowing perfectly the deep and incomprehensible
secrets of God, making us able to search out the promised rest by the two spies
of our souls, Faith and Hope, which bring us some clusters from Esool, and
tastes of that blessedness, which he will once make us perfectly know by
enjoying. That there is a summum bonum and true blessedness of man, the
affections of all men desiring it, do as certainly conclude, as the motions of
natural bodies out of their proper place, do a center and terminum ad quem:
Beatitudo pertinet ad voluntatem tanquam primum objectum ejus. Aquin. 1. 2. q.
3. ^. 4. 2*
all men desire their own good: That most men are the sole workers of their
own evil, comes either from their mistaking true blessedness through
ignorance, or wilful indulgence to their own exorbitant affections, through a
miserable impotency of mind, caused by natural corruption, wherein they are
not able to forbear those things Vid^o meliora, proboq^e, deterior a sequor.
they know will make them finally unhappy. The first will appear, if we
consider that Omnibus in terris, (...) sunt a Gad^b^^ ^sq^e Auroram and Gange^
pauci aigno^^ere p^ss^nt Vera bona. ^uve. Sat. 10
few men can know true good. 1. Because they so much live the life of sense,
that they do too far trust to the testimonies thereof concerning good and
evil, Even in the state of innocence, when man had in himself from his
creation, a power not to have sinned, the will was perverted by the senses
approbation of the forbidden fruit Genesis 3. 6.
(so the woman, seeing that the tree was good for meat, an^ that it was
pleasant to the eyes -- took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also
to her husband --) how much more easily does the natural man now err, when
the understanding darkened, ^and the will miserably subjected to the insulting
power of sin, like a blind Judge. 16. 26.
Samson led by the hand of his servant to the pillars of the house, he
obtains his will with his own destruction? 2. 1 Cor. 15. 34.
Because all have not the knowledge of God, the sole fountain of blessedness,
1 Cor. 2. 14.
and the things of God, are like the rays of the Sun, which can be seen by
no light but his own. Therefore the heathens, whose Romans 1. 21.
foolish hearts were full of darkness (being given over to vile affections,
because of their impiety and unthankfulness) like the Genesis 19. 11
blinded Sodomites, groping for Lots door, sought one happiness, every man as
his own sense and opinion led him, all in vain. Lactan. l. 3. c. 8. Tertul de
pal* c. 5. Ambros To. 1. off. l. 2. c. 2.
Epiourus in pleasure and quiet: Aristippus in corporeal delights: Calliphon
and Di^omachus in honesty and pleasure: Diodorus in immunity from grief: the
Peripateticks in the goods of mind, body and fortune: Herillus in knowledge:
the Stoics in virtue: whereas indeed true happiness is Finis ultimus
rationalis crea^urae tantum. Aquin. 1. 2. q. 3. a. 2. c. dicit, beatitudo est
ultima hominis pe^f^ctio.
the supreme and ultimate end of the reasonable creature* enabled by
understanding to apprehend it, and by will to desire it; that is, Et ib. q. 5.
1. c. beatitudo nominat adeptionem perfecti bom. ^b. q. 3. 2. 4.
his attaining a perfect good, Qua homo conjungitur Deo -- and q. 3. 1. 1m.
which is a conjunction with, and enjoying of God, the Deus est beatitudo per
essentiam suam: non enim per adeptionem ^ut participationem a^icujus alterius
beatus est, sed per essentiam suam; homines autem su^t beati per
participationem --
absolute, eternal, independent, and self blessed good, which is in three
things. 1. In such a vision of the fountain of blessedness, as the creature
is capable of: of which our Savior says, Blessed are the pure in heart, for
they shall see God. Matthew. 5. 8. Secondly, In a divine conformity to God, and
participation of his image, who is most holy and glorious. 1 I^b. 3. 2.
We are now the sons of God, but yet it does not appear what we shall be;
and we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him -- Which Saint
Peter styles q 2 Pet. 1. 4.
a participation of the godly nature. Thirdly, in perfect and interminable joy,
of which it is said, Psalm. 16. 1^
In thy prefence is the fullness of joy, and at thy right hand are pleasures
for ever. Perfect, because in respect of the subject, nothing can be added,
seeing it shall be an absolute fullness, In quibus nec desiderium paenam
generat, nec satiet as sastidium.
without all satiety, or desiring more. In all other fruitions, desire is
restless, ever Vnus Pell^oj veni non sufficit orbis.
flying beyond all worldly acquests; but when there is attained an absolute
blessedness, then all affections, like those Ezekiel. 1. 24. 25.
creatures in the Prophets vision, let down their wings, and stand still: for
perfect blessedness fills all desire of man ( Homo non est perfect beatus,
quam d^^refiat (...) quid desiderandum, and qu^re^dum. 1. 2 ^. 3. 8. c. Cum
perventum fuerit ad beatitudinem, unusquisque attinget terminum sibi praefixum
expraede^matione divina; nec restabit ulterius aliquid quo tendatur; quam vis
in illa terminatione unus pe venia^ ad majorem propinquitatem Dei, alius ad
minorem: and ideo uniuscujusque gaudiumerit plenum ex part gauden it is; quia
uniuscujusque desiderium pl^ne quietabitur. Aquin. 2. 2. q. 28. a. 3. 2.
otherwise it were not perfect) because it is a participation of Gods
blessedness, who is (...). etc. Greg. Nazi^^ze^* o^at. ^ p^st i^it.
(...), (...). ^ lem. Alex. ^^rom. 1. 7*
of all that is desirable the chief and most excellent: when the Disciples
(being not yet free from those secular affections, which are inherent in the
most holy and refined earthly tabernacles (had but a glimpse of that
beatificall vision of the Deity in the transfiguration of Christ in the mount:
Mark* 9. 5 6 though Peter, surprised with joy, knew not what he said, yet he
said the truth, Master it is good for us to be here. -- That taste of heaven made
him forget earth, and desire to build there, where he perceived such
excellency dwelt.

This joy is likewise interminable, because it is a state, E^^^ ga^dium in
fine, sed sine fine. Bernard. de verb. Apost.
which being once had, can never be lost: The longest terms of time expire,
but eternity is an infinite and immeasurable continuation: We may lose that
which the beguiled world calls happiness, consisting of things temporal,
but that which is true blessedness, once had, we cannot lose; Aquin. 1. q. 6^.
8. ^.
because it is in the vision and fruition of God, Cum ipsa beatitud^ si^
perf^ctum ^o^^m and s^fficiens, ^portet quod desiderium bo^inis quietet, and
(...) mal^m excludat.
which as it excludes all sin, -- ^lioq^i^ necesse est quod tiwore
ami^tendi, vel dolor de certi^udine amissioni^ a^^iga^ur --
so all misery, and consequently change, and fear of change: Perfect a
beatitudo b^minis in visione drvinae essentie consisti^: est autem impossible
quod aliquis v^d^ns divinam e^^^ntiam, ve^it ea^ non videre: quia omne bonum
habi^^m quo aliquis carerae vult, aut est i^sufficiens, ant habet aliquod
incommodum annex^m, propter quod in fastidi^m ve^it: visio autem divine
essentiae replet animam (...) b^nis, cum conjungat fontitotius bonitatis.
both which are incompatible with true blessedness: because where there is no
sin, there can neither -- propria voluntate, beatus non potest beatitudinem
deser^re: Similiter etiam non pot^st eam perdere, Deo ^ubtrabente -- non potest
talis subtra^tio a Deo j^sto judice provenire, nifi pro aliqua culpa, in qua^
c^dere non potest, qui Dei essentiam videt, cum ad banc vis^onem ex necessitate
sequ^tur rectis udo vol^ntatis -- nec al^quid aliud agens potest ^am
subtra^ere, qu^a men's Deo conjuncta, super omnia alia elevatur. Aquin. 1. 2. q.
5. a, 4. c.
be a voluntary desertion of God, nor a just abjection from him.

Now we must know, that though there be but one true blessedness in the
conjunction with God, the only fountain thereof, yet has it two states in
man. First, In via, in this life, where it is begun in our communion with God,
through faith in Christ. Secondly, In patria, that is, absolute and complete in
the life to come: the one in grace, the other in glory. Which being laid down,
we have two considerable points. First, that none but the good can be blessed:
for none other enjoy the blessed presence of God, or partake of his image.
Secondly, their happiness neither consists in any secular, external, or
worldly condition (and consequently cannot be lost in the loss of any of these
things) nor is it complete in this present life. Concerning the first, the
Scripture abounds with testimonies: Blessed is the man that does not w^ike in
the counsel of the wi^ked -- but his delight is in the law of the Lord -- he
shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters -- the wi^ked are not so
-- Psalm. 1. 1. 4. 5. blessed is every one that fe^reth the Lord, and walks in
his ways, Psalm. 128. 1. Blessed i^ he whose wickedness is forgiven, and
whose si^ne is covered: Blessed is the man to whom the Lord im^uteth not
iniquity. Psalm. 32. 1, 2. Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord. Psalm.
144. 15. Mat. 5. 3
Blessed are the poor in spirit* Blessed are the ^eek, and those that hunger
and thirst after righteou^nesse. Blessed are the merciful, the pure in heart
the peace^akers -- All is to the holy: Isa. 59. 2.
sin disjoyneth man from God: Aqu. 1. ^. 94.
by how much more any creature is like God in holinesie, by so much more does
he enjoy true bleslednesse in him. The blesling is (says Hacest ^ene^ictio
^loriari in D^o, and inhabitari a Deo. Aug. in Psalm 5.
Augustine) to rejoice in God, and have him dwell in us.

For the second, it appears by that which has bin said, that the Saints
happiness is not in any secular, external, or worldly matter; for none of all
these make us more acceptable to God, more holy, or more They hu^t most m^n who
attain them, and make it more difficult for them to be saved. Luke 18. 24, 25.
Egoverd vego illud essi bonum, qu^d ^oceat hab^n^ -- divitiae possiden ^^b^s
persaepe noc^e^^^t. Bo^t. de^ous. l. 2. pros. 5.
secure from eternal misery: and by reason grounded on Gods inviolable
justice: for if riches could make happy, never should any wicked man be rich,
or good man poor: if pleasures, Christ would never have said, Luke 6. 25
woe be to you that are full, for ye shall hunger; woe be to you that now
laugh, for ye shall wail and weep. If for this life's sake only, we have hope
in Christ, 1 Cor. 15. 19.
we are of all men the most mise rabble; and therefore 1 Job. 3. ^.
it does not yet appear what we, the sons of God, shall be. Blessedness is
a Beatitudo cum si^ perfectum and sufficiens bonum, o^n^alum excludit, and omne
desiderium impl^t. 1. 2. q. 5. a. 3. c.
perfect and sufficient good, not only excluding all evil, but filling all
desire; and who is so mere a stranger to the world, that he knows it not to
be Qu^m multis amarit^ dinibus humanae faelicitatis dulcedo ^espersa est, quae
si etiam fru^ntiesse jocunda videatur: ta^^en quo minus cum veli^ abeat,
retineri non possit. Boe^t. de con. l. 2. pros. 4.
full of evil? or the condition of temporal possessors, that he is Quis est
enim ta^ compositae faelicitatis, ut non aliqu^ ex part cum status sui
qualitate rixetur? a^xia enim res est human^rum conditio honorum, etc. B^^t. de
consolat. l. 2. pros. 4.
not conscious of desiring something more? When we duly consider of any of
those things, which the world now adoreth, pleasures, riches, honor, we shall
find their splendor to be no better than that of glowwormes, how ever
beautiful it seems in our want of true light, all that luster vanishes when
we can clearly see it. Speak we of wicked men growing rich and great? are
they not like those Act. 14. 13.
bulls of Lystra, adornd with garlands and flowers for the slaughter? are they
not Miseri in ^oc altius toll^ntur, ut decidant altius: hi eni^ ut victime ad
sup^licium saginantur: ^t ^ostiae ad paenam coronantu^ --
like the Shellfish, carried up to be broken in their fall? What ever we have
of the world, is it not absque notitia Dei, quae potest ^sse solida faelicitas,
cum sit somnio similis? antequam tenetur el^bitur. Minut. F^l. O^tav.
like the riches of a dreaming man? what ever we rejoice in, may prove an
occasion of sorrow, Quod enim vol^ptate dissolvi^^r, id contraria n^c^sse est
tristitia contrahatur: nec i^mune e^istere ab anxie^ate ^oer^ris, quod lae^^tia
trepid^t, aut levitatibus extollitur gaudiorum. Arnob. adv. Gent. l* 7.
seeing these affections are conversant about the same things: and if
happiness be not in any of these things, then it necessarily follows, that
the want or loss of these, that is, pleasures, honors, riches, or the like,
can no more take away from a Saint of God his true blessedness, than the
violent wind can move the beams of the Sun, which against all force thereof
shine through the air; or tha^ the furious storms which sometimes draw hideo^^
curtains over Stars or Sun, can extinguish their light.

And lastly, this happiness is not complete in this life, we are yet but in
via, toward it: as Moses said to Isr^el in the wilderness, Deuteronomy. 12. 9
Ye are not yet come to rest, and to the inheritance which the Lord thy God
gives thee: So may I here, the blessedness to which we tend now, is, like the
Extra port^m Collinar^. Aug. de C. D. l. 4. c. 16.
temple of Rest at Rome, set out of the gate: Ego conjectu^a d^^cor, Quiet^^
^an^ ad mor^^os pertin^isse. Lodovic. Viv. com. in Aug. dec. D.
which some think imported rest to the dead only: as Revel. 14. 13. the voice
from heaven pronounced, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord -- they rest
from their labo^rs: according to which Heb. 13. 13, 14.
it is said Let us go forth therefore out of the camp bearing his reproach: for
here we have no continuing City, but we seek one to come. Such are the
Saints, that they who will not live their life, would yet feign die their death:
Number. 23. 1^.
all desire their last condition: O that I might die the death of the righteous!
let my last end ^ee like his. The -- dicique beatus, A^te obitum nemo, sup*
emaque f^nera debet* Ov. Met.
heathen Solon knew that happiness could not be before the end of this life,
pronounced it so. Others confessed the same: experience preaches it: reason
concludes it: *it is the end which makes completely happy: and therefore
Neminemque omnino ^sse securum, nec debere ^sfe securum, done^ ad illam patriam
ve^ niatur, unde nemo exit amicus, quo nemo admittitur inimicus. Aug. ^^ar. in
Psalm. 67. Phil. 2. 12.
no wise man ought to be secure, until he arrive at that country, from
whence no friend departs, to which no enemy is admitted: therefore Saint Paul
says, make an end of your own salvation with fear and trembling, not with
such a fear as leads to despair, but with such a fear as shakes off
presumption and security: which is the souls guardian, Timor custos
innoc^ntiae, de quo Cyprian. l. 2. ep. 2. Sit tantum timor in nobis innocentiae
custos -- ne accepta securit (...) indiligentiam pariat, and ve^us denuo hostis
obrepat. --
and virtues keeper. Such a trembling, as like Ionahs storm, gives that no
rest, for which the anger was, which none can calm, till that sin be cast
over board, which God pursues, like the needle in the compass, which
continually trembles, and by continual shaking returns to the C^nosure to
guide us tight: Such is true faith, Modo enim nihil quietis aut securitatis
invenire possumus, dura adhuc in nobis ipsis ingemiscimus gravati: adopti^i^m
expectantes redemptionem corporis nostri, etc. Greg^^n 7. Psalm. poenit.
which here can never be secure, till the last enemy be destroyed, till death
be swallowed up in victory: it has here continual trialls, so agitating it,
that it never rests, till it return to a blessed confidence in God;
according to which the Psalmist, after his fears and dangers said, Return
unto thy rest, O my soul Psalm. 116. 7. like the weary Dove to the Arc; so
faith, after its flight over a vast deluge of trialls, returns with assured
signs and Emblemes of peace.

All this is to teach you, not to seek happiness with the deluded children of
this world, in those things, concerning which a true experience shall at last
pronounce with the Preacher, E^cles. 2. 11. Eccles. 1. 14. Quid igitur O
mortales extra petitis intra vo^ positam faeli^itate^? Bo^^. de cons. l. 2.
pros. 4.
All is Vanity and Veocation of spirit. In all their labors, cares, and most
diligent inquests, they seek happiness, as those fifty men Eliah* 2 King. 2.
17. which sought but found him not. It Is only to be found in our union with
God, and that in sanctity: for what communion can there be between CHRIST and
Belial? therefore Nemo mal^s faelix. Iuv. Sat. 4.
no wicked man can be happy, though he have what he desires: Omnes be^^i
^abent qu^d v^lunt, quamvis and s^^t miser^, qu^ v^l n^n habent quod volun^,

It Is true, all the blessed have what they would (yea in the midst of wants)
though having of our wills makes us not blessed: but they are ever unhappy,
who either have not what they would, or have that which they should not desire:
Nearer then to Blessedness is an holy will, without success, than a wicked,
which obtains what it desires: and this the Prima ^s^ haec ultio, quod se

joys commonly aggravate our succeeding sorrows, leaving us doubtful whether

Which brings me to the next part, the Saints Unity with God and his Church.

the faithful, and all the Churches of Christ are but one Catholic Church, as
all seas (however they receive diverse denominations from the diverse shores they

temple, which Christ (of whom Solomon, the son of David, was a figure) did
build, and to which he calls all nations of the earth, in one faith, one
baptism, one truth, and one hope of salvation in him, who is the sole Savior
and Mediator between God and man, 1 Timothy 2. 5. Act. 4. 12. Hic est templi

the only door of the great temple, the way of light, the guide to life.

So that we are here to consider these three ascensions in the house of God:

First, the house of prayer, set apart, and consecrated to the service of God,
where the holy oracles of God, and Sacraments are rightly administered, whence
the spiritual incense of public prayers, and sweet odours of thankesgiving
are offered from the golden censer, by the Angel of the Covenant, before the
throne of God, Rev. 8. 3, 4. where the blessed assemble on earth, where the
honor of God dwells among men: where Christ has promised to be present,
Matthew. 18. 20. where that blessed Anna Et in prosperis, and in adversis ab hoc
opere non cessat. Alcuinus in sest. purif.

night and day, Luke 2. 37. neither in prosperity, nor in adversity ceasing:
this house the Church militant in sundry parts of the world frequenteth, and
reverenceth for his sake, who there, most evidently manifests his presence on
earth, and in his holy ordinance and sacred mysteries is there worshipped: it
was David's greatest grief in Psalm. 42. 1. 4.
his exile, as of other Saints, that they could not be present here: for this
they Psalm. 84. 2. 3.
emulated the sparrow and swallow, who had free access to the places near
Gods altars. And undoubtedly, all the Saints on earth bear the like affection
to the house of God, above all amiable places of the earth. With this we may
join all that are by the outward seals of the covenant, admitted into the
visible Church, as Guests invited to the Luke 14.

2. The communion of Saints, who are the body of Christ, and temple of Gods
holy spirit, built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus
Christ himself being the chief corner stone, in whom all the building coupled
together, grows unto an holy temple in the Lord; into which are admitted
only those Ezekiel 9* 4

gave himself to me; and when he gave himself for me, he restored me to my
self. What shall I render the Lord? if I could give my self a thousand times
over, what am I to the Lord? there is nothing in Heaven or Earth among all the
creatures, so divine, so excellent as Christ: he that has him Affatim dives
est, qui ^^m Ohristo panper est. Ierom. l. 2. ^p. ad Heliodor.
has all things, and having nothing else abounds: no wonder if the Saints
ever praise him, yea when they go per vallem flet^s: here is their Laus
flagella^^is med^cina est (...) Aug in Psalm. 144.
wounds medicine: here is the trial, here is the Selah set to erect the mind
to consideration: it is an easy matter to praise the Lord blessing us, and
giving us good things (yet too many forget that plain song) but if thou art a
blessed man indeed, thou must praise the Lord in the Valley of Baca, in tears
and bitter forrowes, when he afflicts thee and takes away all earthly
comforts from thee: Job 1. 21. In* boc itaque men's j^sta ab injusta
discernitur: quod omnipotentis Dei laudem and inter adversa conside^^r: q^od
no^ cum rebus srangitur, non cum casu gloriae exterioris cadit: sed in hoc
magis qualis cum r^bus suerit demonstrat, quae and sine rebus robustius stat.
G. ego. Mor. in Job. l. 11. ^. 1^.
'twas Jobs resolution, The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken it, blessed be
the Name of the Lord: such is the possession of Christ, as that no external
estate, no nor death it self can make that possessour unhappy, or any more
take away his blessedness, than the storms we feel on earth can shake down
the orbs of heaven: what ever God takes away, if he take not himself from
thee, thou art blessed, neither can thou be otherwise, no not when thou
seem, to others and thy self most miserable: Therefore the Psalmist (though
in bitterness of spirit and present affliction he recounted his happiness
past) yet recalleth his affections, Why art thou cast down, Psalm. 4^. 11.
O my soul, and why art thou so disquieted within me? wait on God. For
indeed we may not be ungrateful. 1 Samuel 1. 8
Why weepest thou? (said Elkanah to afflicted Hannah) why eatest thou not? and
why is thy heart troubled? am not I better to thee than ten sons? how much
more may our blessed Jesus say to us (when we turn our debt of praises into
dedolency, and 2 Samuel 19 2.
our victory, for 1 Cor. 25. 57.
which the Saints praise GOD, into mourning, and dejectedness of souls) why
mourn you thus, who have such interest in me? what ever GOD does to the Saints,
it is best for them: the Physician, better than the patient knows what is good
and necessary for him: if it be sometimes best for a man to be grieved with
the Putridae carnes ferro curantur and cauterio. D. Hieronym. ^
lancer and cautery, how much better is it for a sinner to be cured by
afflictions?

It Is a character of the blessed man, ever to praise the Lord: the Laudant^m
v^de^, (...) p^oba^ ama^^em. Aug. in Psa. ^04.
wicked can never do it: because they neither love nor serve the Lord: the
sinner dishonors him in all his actions, and therefore can but subdolously
praise him in words: It Is a dishonor to a good man, to have some notorious lewd
fellow praise him, Melius est ut tu vituperares, quam dolose laudares. Aug. in
Psalm. 119.
twere more honor to have such a one dispraise and condemn him: feldome do
they condemn any but the good, or No^ nisi grande bonum a Nero^e damnatum.
Tertull. adv. Gent.
applaud any but the evil, because every one loves his like: he that knows
him (said Quis enim nesciat nibil nisi flagi^i^sum t^o ore laudari? Ierom. l.
2. ep. 3. Sabiniano.
Tertullia^ of Nero) might understand, that he condemned nothing but some
great good? when a wicked mouth (used to cursing, profanation, and filthy
talk) presumes to sing the praises of God, I may say (as Quomodo Deum viola^,
qui boc modo placal? M. Fell. Octa.
Minucius Foelix, in another kind) how does he violate the sacred Majesty of
God, who would so please him? Edixit, ne quis ipsum ali^s quam Appelles
pingeret, quam Pyrgoteles sculperet, quam Lysippus ex aere duceret. Plin. not.
bist. l. 7. c. 37.
Alexander would not suffer any but apelles to take his picture, least by
unskilful hands his countenance should be misreported to posterity: with how
much better reason does GOD forbid any but his Saints to praise him, least they
that know him not, should blaspheme and think him evil whom such men praise?
he therefore that says, Psalm. 50. 5, 14. 16.
Gather my Saints to gather unto me -- offer unto God praise: says unto the
wicked* What have thou to do to declare mine ordinances, and that thou
should take my covenant into thy mouth; seeing thou hate to be reformed?
praise is not Ec^lus. 15. 9.
seemly in the mouth of a sinner: when the devil confessed Christ, Mark. 3.
1^, 12. Luke 4. 41.
he sharply rebuked those unclean spirits, and suffered them not to say that
they knew him to be the Christ; (...). Theophylact. in Luc. 4.
that we might know, such are not to be heard though they speak truth,
because they do it to some evil end: and that Christ needed no such witnesses
as both (...), ib* i^ Matthew. 8.
professed enmity, and in their best profession call the truth of Religion into
question; for who would not suspect that to be evil, which the wicked seem to
like and allow? therefore if thou will be admitted into this blessed Queere,
be thou Neli bonae cantilene tuae obstrepere moribus malis -- qui laudatis,
been vivile -- ^auda^io impii ^ffendit Deum* Augustine, in Psalm. 146.
holy, that thou may truly praise God, and trust in him, which is the next
character of the blessed man.

Blessed is the m^^ whose strength is in thee.

Blessed are they whose confidence and trust is in the Lord. Psalm. 121. 2
My help comes from the Lord who has made Heaven and earth, says the
Saint: Some put Psalm. 20. 7
their trust in Chariots and some in horses; but we will remember the Name of
the Lord our God. And good reason: for

1. They Psalm 125. 1.
who trust in the Lord shall be as mount Sion, which cannot be removed. This
is a trust which cannot i Psalm. 9. 10.
deceive.

2. None but the Saints which are the sons of God can trust in him: the
reprobate (though he may have a false confidence for a time, as he may have
Mat^h. 13. 20, 21. L^ke 8. 13.
a temporary faith) knows what he must expect, and therefore beholds God as
an angry judge: but he is the just Isai 63. 16.
man's father: and not only Psalm. 103. 13.
pittieth him as a tender father does his child, but Romans 8. 14, 15, 16.
gives him the spirit of adoption to lead him, and assure him that he is
indeed a child of God.

3. They only have Romans 5. 1, 2
access through faith unto his grace, by the Ephesians. 2. 18
spirit which dwells in them, they have peace with God who are justified by
faith in Christ. God will no more remember their sins and iniquities, and
therefore Heb. 10. 17, 22.
they may be bold to draw near in assurance of faith to the Throne of grace,
Christ being their advocate to appear always and to mediate for them. He ever
offers up their *petitions for them Revel. 8. 3
upon the golden Altar (his precious merits) which is before the Throne of God.

4. He gives his Psalm. 91. 11, 12.
Angels charge over them: and they Psalm. 34. 7.
pitch their tents round about them: so that when they seem most forlorn, 2
King. 6. 16.
they that are with them are more than can be against them.

5. He has not only given them Ephesians. 1. 13, 14. 16. 4. 30 Romans 8. 23. 2 Cor.
1. 22. Galat. 4 6, 7.
the first fruits of the Spirit, the earnest of his covenant; Qu^m* d^^^dum
enim nobis arrabonem spiritus reliquit, ita and a nobis arrabonem car^is
a^cepit, and vexit in coelum, pignus toti^s sum^ae i^luc qu^nd^ ^ue redigendae:
securae e^^o^^ Caro and sa^guis, usurpastis and c^elum and regnum Deiin
C^^^isto. Tertull. deresur* carnis. c. 51.
but ascending into Heaven, he has taken up with him an earnest and pledge of
their flesh and blood, which shall through him at last possess the same
blessed inheritance with him.

6. There can be no sure trust in any other: all earthly things are subject to
the Laws of time, and therefore to sudden and continual changes: Thou that
risest cheerfully in the morning, N s^is q^id s^r^^s (...) vebal.
know not what the late evening may bring. There are many chances in this
life, and one certain change in the end thereof: Look on proud Dan. 4. 27 30.
Nebuchadnezzar, ostenting his magnificent Babel, built for the honor of his
Majesty; while the word was in the Kings mouth, the voice from Heaven told him
his Kingdom was departed from him; and the very same hour was it fulfilled.
Look on profane Dan. 5. 1, 2, etc. 5. 30.
Belshazzar, feasting with a thousand Princes drinking in the impropriated
vessels of the Temple of Jerusalem an unknown hand writing a terrible doom
upon the wall, and the same night executed. Behold the rich man, projecting for
greater barnes, singing a re^uiem to his soul, but presently hearing, Luke 12.
19.
Thou fool, this night shall they take away thy soul; and thou shall in these
examples see a true scene of humane changes.

The Job 14. 2.
flowers are Emblems of our Vita itaque in carne f^^s in fan^ est. -- homo enim
more floris procedit ex ^cc^lto; and subito apparet in public^; qui statim ex
publico per mortem retrabitur ad o^^ultum. Carnis nos viriditas oftendit: sed
ariditas pulveris ab a^pectibus retrebit. Gregor. Moral. in Job. l. 11. ^. 27.
present lives, now sweetly flourishing in the vigor of their youth, vying
beauty with the fairest Rachels, and luster with the most magnificent ( Mat. 6.
29
Solomon in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these.) presently cropped
and withered. An Aristot.
Ephemeron, whose whole story is but, oritur, moritur, such is man; A morning
vapor, which a little hear dissolveth; such is man. A Jonah 4. 6, 7.
Ionahs Gourd, in the height of the owners joy, smitten and withered quite
away; such is man.

1. O vain hopes of men, and idle thoughts, how often do you beguile us? how
often are you broken in the middle of your flight; or like ceiled Doves, mount
till you die? or like Exodus 14. 25, 27.
Pharaohs Chariot wheels, there falling off, where we are most deeply
engaged in the returning floods of sorrows? vain confidence in riches: Fluxa
est d^vit^urum na^ura, etc* Basil. in Psalm. 61.
they ebb and flow uncertainely: their gliding streams continually change
their masters: this field is thine to day, to morrow it passes to another:
look upon this place; how often have these mountains changed Lords, and these
houses, owners? all earthly goods, at the last hour of our lives, shall (like
2 King. 2 13.
Eli^hs mantle, in his ascension) fall from us to some others use: vain
confidence in any of the sons of men: the wise, the illustrious, the noble,
the virtuous, the strong, the fair, the chaste, the lovely, the young, all
die: experience teaches it: one day tells another, one night certifieth
another (I would we had wanted this days example) none are exempted, let us
not therefore strive with our Maker, but humbly subject our hearts and
affections to his blessed will, who ever will do that which shall be best for
us: let us consider that it is our own fault when we are to disconsol^te, if we
will needs build on any but God, that ground failing us, our hopes are broken:
but the foundation of the Lord remains sure: Fixis rationibus peraguntur res
eius, and quod semel decretum est fi eri, nulla potest novitate immutari
Arnobius. advers. Gent. l. 2.
his immutable decrees are certain, and shall take effect at the appointed
time.

2. Examine thy trust in God, whether it be faithful before the time of
trial: many profess confidence, and yet in trials it fails them. Examine
therefore first, whether thy trust be grounded on Gods Word: that only is
infallible, and cannot deceive: the confidence which crosses this, must needs
fail, because this cannot: if an incorrigible sinner, trust to Deuteronomy. 29. 19,
20.
impunity: that confidence must fail him: if any man trust in wrong and
robbery; that confidence must fail him, because Gods justice cannot: if any
man trust in lying vanities, he forsakes his Jonah 2. 8.
own mercy. If any man make himself rules of wisdom, and counsel, against
the revealed will of God, and trust therein, (were those counsels as profound
as Achitophels) the Lord will infatuate and make them void. If any man will
trust in riches, or in his heart serve idols: his trust against Gods Word, must
fail: they that make them, are like unto them, and so are all they that put
their trust in them: all senseless ^ when the N^c sentit sua nativitatis
inj^riam -- ita nec p^slea de v^stra vene^ atione etc. Mi^ut. Eel. q. s.
line is s^retched over the idol, when it is hewed, finished, adored, it
perceives not: it cannot defend it self: when, the birds sit on their heads,
and spiders derive their slender webs from their mouths ( Quant^ verius ^e diis
vestris animalia muta naturaliter j^dicant? non sentire cos sciunt, r^dunt,

more reasonably judging of them, then superstitious men) they feel it not.
It Is not easy to resolve, which was the most unreasonable and ridiculous
custom of heathens setting dogs, Est and anser^ vigil cura Capitolio test^ta

senseless gods to keep their bodies, souls, lives, and states.

2. Whether it be built upon that which is unchangeable: Cursed be the man
that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and withdraws his heart from
the Lords for he shall be like the heath in the Wilderness. -Blessed be the man
that trusts in the Lord, -for he shall be as a tree planted by the water,
-her leaf shall be green, and shall not care for the year of drought,
neither shall cease from ^eelding fruit. Iere. 17. 5, 6, 7, 8. That sailers
trust must fail, who in the storm, lays hold on a loose rope. If a man
trust in Physicians as Asa did, 2 Chronicles. 16. 12. to an Egyptian confederacy,
as Iohana^ and the Captains of the host would do, Ie^. 42. that trust shall
fail, and this prove but a staff of reed, Ezekiel. 29. 6. If a man trust in
riches, as that wealthy fool in the Gospel did, L^ke 12. 19, 20. If in
strength of armies, and prosperity, as Vzziah did (when he was strong, his
heart was lift up to his destruction. 2 Chronicles. 26 16.) they shall not help in
the day of affliction; and the Lord will break these: if a man trust to his
own counsels, or assistance of friends, he may have those prove like
Achithophels, and these like Jobs mis^r^ble comforters. If a man trust in any
thing in this life, or life it self, it must fail: Job 17* 13 14.
I bough I hope the grave shall be mine house, and I shall make my bed in the
dark. I shall say to corruption thou art my father, and to the worm* thou art
my mother -- all things under the Sun are subject to change: there can be no
sure trust in them.

3. Examine whether it be a firm and continuing trust: not only when thou art
prosperous, but appearing in the greatest of afflictions. Job 13. 15
Though he slay me* yet will I trust in him, said Job. This is true confidence
which will hold the fiery trial: and true Nunqu^m est patientiae virtus in
prosper^^; ^lle a^tem est vere pa^i ens, qui and adversis atteritur, and t^men
a ^pei suae re^t^^udine non ^n^^r^a^ur. Gregor. mor. in Job l. 11. c. 18.
patience, which will endure adversity It Is not the trust of the blessed, which,
like that seed which fell on stony ground, comes up and dureth but for a
season: M^tth. 13. 21. or like the Job 6. 16, 17.
rivers which are rank in Winter, but in time are dried up with heat and
consumed: and when it is hot, they fail out of their places* Which least
appear when we have most need: As those ^tellae caedentes, were never any
part of the celestial orbs: so that trust which at any time fails, was never
true. To him that Ma^h. 24 13* 46. Revel. 2. 10.
persevereth unto the end, are all the promises: resolve therefore to trust in
the Lord in every estate, and that shall demonstrate thee blessed.

So we come to the last character of true blessedness, Sincerity of heart: And
in whose heart are thy ways. Not man's own ways, but the commandments and
ways of God: Isai. 55. 8. Galat. 5. 19, 20.
My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, says the
Lord. The ways of man are the works of the flesh, Adultery fornication,
uncleanness, wantonness, idolater witchcraft, hatred, debate, emulations,
wrath, contentions, seditions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, and such
like: but the way of God, is the fruit of his Spirit, love, joy, peace,
long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekene^^e, temperance.
Concerning the wicked, it is said, their inward parts are very wickedness: The
Psalm. 14. 1
fool said in his heart, there is no God. Luke 12. 17, 18.
The rich man thought with himself, I will build greater barnes: there was the
way of the world in his heart: but the way to blessedness is Gods way: the
Math. 7. 13.
narrow way of faith and obedience to all his commandments, and (that which is
not the least difficulty) constancy therein. Hil^rie says well, Semitam esse
q^ae trita est* in Ps. 118.
a way is that which is a beaten path: it is not a pace or two, which makes the
way, but a constant walking the same way. The hypocrites heart is like an
anvill, for any thing to be forged thereon: like a theater, on which is
represented, sometimes the Saint, sometimes the Devil: like a mercenary
press, whose Letters are sometimes set for holy pages, sometimes for impious
and lascivious pamphlets. But our present character is of Gods ways in the
blessed man's heart: in this way was Enoch walking with God, till he was
translated. Some go a little way willingly, but like Raeth. 1. 14
Orpah, are easily persuaded to go back to Moab. You may sometimes f^nde Saul
among the Prothets: it is but for a (...) you shall after have him at End^r. You
may find Iu^as among the holy Apostles: it is but a flash; you shall have him
afterward with the High Priests, selling his Masters blood. Mad men have their
lucid intervalls: the worst have some better fits, and resolutions, but in the
blessed man's heart are the ways of God.

Not in the tongue, and outward semblance only: Romans 2. 29
he is an Israelite, which is one within. Such a one was Job. 2. 47.
Nathanael, in whom was no guile. It Is the sincerity of the heart, which is the
seal of the covenant of God, and mark of the blessed man. All is, as is the
heart to God: some (like that Clem Al. ^ Paed. l. 2. c* 1 fine.
Asellus piscis) have Cor in ventre; as says the Apostle, Phil. 3. 19. Whose
God is their belly. Some have the world and riches there: If riches increase,
set not your ^ea^^ ^po^ them: they are the thorns which commonly choke up the
seed of Gods word: there (...). Theophy^^ct in Mat. 13.
is a lawful possession; the danger is for him that will be rich, 1 Timothy 6.
9. there is a good use of riches; the danger is, if a man trust in them, or
fix his heart upon them: there is a good use of thorns; if they be orderly
set about the field, they make a good fence; the mischief is, if they grow up
in it. Such are riches, good in any place, but the heart of the owner. But thou
blessed man, have the fear, love and worship of God in thine Verus cultus est
in p^ctore. Arnob. l. 4. adv. Gent.
heart, there all is sincere: do not thou desire to Ne^ ^ppet^^ ultra videri
quames, ^^t possis ^ltraesse quam vider^s. Greg. l. 4. cp. 58.
seem more than thou art, because the searcher of hearts beholds all thy
ways. Fronti nulla fid^s: a very hypocrite may have the ways of God in his
external behavior, and yet be but like an Clem. Al. Pad. l. 3. c. ^ Init*
Egyptian temple, with a reverend comeliness without; but if you examine the
inside, you shall find a cat, a goat, or serpent, in stead of a God. Such
Christ styles painted Sepulchers, which have (...) ib. strom. l. 4.
only an inscription, and name of sanctity, no more.

Thou must have these ascensions of heart, to think of God, if thou will be
blessed. The more Moses conferred with God in the mountain, of the more divine
countenance was he: the more thou think of God, and conferrest with him,
the more like him, the more blessed shall thou be: which that thou may do,
Quanto plus amaveris, tanto plus ascendes. Aug.
love him, speak to him in frequent prayer, and study his word, Romans 3. 16, 17.
which shows destruction and unhappiness in our own ways, but life and
blessedness in his. Romans 8. 7.
For if ye live after the flesh ye shall die -- But as many as are lead by his
spirit, are the sons of God. Once Number. 7. 89. Exodus 25. 22.
the soft voice whispered from the mercy seat, to declare all things which he
would give in commandment to the children of Israel. Once the cloudy pillar
lead them in the way, but now the word of God, the holy Scripture, is our
oracle, and cloudy pillar. The Arc, which the Priests bare, I sh. 3. 6.
went before Israel into Canean. Why they first? why not the prudent
Magistrates? why not the armed legions? that we may know that there is no
entering* into the heavenly rest, true blessedness, but by following the Arc
of GODS testimony, which the Priests bear before the people, the word of God:
this is as that Math. 2. 9
star, which lead the wise men to Christ; this is 2 Timothy 3. 15.
able to make a man wise unto salvation, and therefore blessed: this is as that
river Ez k. 47 1. 9. 12.
issuing from the threshold of the house of God, every thing that lives by it,
shall grow and be fruitful: to this the Saints resort, as doves to the
waters: let us all sit down by this, that as we go the Moritur omne quod
nascitur. Minut* Fell.
way of all flesh to death, we may with the same paces go the way of all the
blessed to eternal life.

To you that mourn for the deceased, is my last address. Genesis 37* 31. 34.
Jacob sorrowed for his loved Joseph, when he had seen his coat dipped in
blood: but when he was assured by the Genesis 45. 26, 27.
Chariots, which Joseph sent to carry him, that he was alive, and happily
honored in Pharaohs court, then the spirit of ^acob revived. It Is your great
loss which you bewail, and Christ's tears at Lazarus grave warrant an holy
mourning for the dead: yet not beyond faith and reason: 1 *I bes. 4* 13.
Sorrow not even as other that have no hope. Faith must stay excess: and in
reason, D^l^^d (...) est q^o^ nab^^ ^i^^ ra^tus sit: consola^dum quod ad
melio^a transterit Am^rosde Valentinorat.
setting our own interests aside, why should we mourn for them that are
blessed? C^em. Alcitat. Empedo^l. Euripi them, etc. strom ^. 3.
Some ancients, which knew no more but rules of reason, wont to celebrate their
friends Natalls with mourning, because all are borne to miseries, but their
Funerals with rejoicing, because in death they rested. If this our deceased
Sister could hear and reply, would she not cry from Heaven, Weep not for me,
for I am blessed? the whole course of her life proclaims it: Ps. 128. 1
Blessed is every one that fears the Lord -- I am confident to say, she did
so. Mat. 5. 9.
Blessed are the peace makers: to what controversy did she ever approach, but
like the Dove to the Arc, with overtures of peace in her mouth? Blessed are
they that have Unity with God and his Church: She was a constant lover of the
Saints, and the place where Gods honor dwells. The blessed praise God: it
was her constant practice: witness this Psalm, often in her mouth, and one of
the last she sang among the living. Is confidence in God a mark of the
blessed? her conversation sounded out, Whom have I in heaven but thee -- her
last, Lord, Lord. expressed with breaking heartstrings and an expiring spirit,
when death shut up her senses by a sudden arrest, witnesses for her. Is it
happiness to have the ways of God in the heart: I am confident, that malice
it self never laid on her the imputation of hypocrite. Excuse me in the
abridgement which I now gather. I know the light of one star obscureth not
another, because all borrow from the same Sun; neither do the due praises of
one Saint derogate from another, 1 Co^. 4. 7.
seeing all receive of one God. She (...). Naz. ^^at. 11.
was an orname^t of women a pattern of virtue; a blessed child to her parents:
a faithful Sarah to her husband: a Act. 16. 14
Lydi^ to the word of God; a Act. 9. 36 39. She was none of them, of whom Cl.
Alexandrinus said, pueru^ Orp^an^m non adm^^t^nt, quae ps^^^^cos and (...)
enutr^u^t. Paed. l. 3* ^. 4.
Dorcas to the poor widows and orphans: a Martha to strangers: to all, as
N^zianze^s Gorgo^ia, Citra superciliu^^ p^dic^. Therefore blessed, she now
res^eth in Christ, and her works follow her. Which that we may likewise do,
the good Lord teach us all so to live, and number our days, that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom, whereof his fear is the beginning, and eternal
salvation the end and consumma^ion: hear us O Lord, and have mercy upon us,
through the merits of thy Son, our blessed Lord and Savior JESUS CHRIST, to
whom with thee, O Farh^r, and the Holy Ghost, be all honor, praise, and glory
asscribed in heaven and earth, now and for ever. Amen.
