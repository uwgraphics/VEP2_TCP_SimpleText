IF Poets may prove
and try their own wit
In feyneyng of Fables
great Vices to blame:
And if they be blameless
although they do hytt
The Treuth* in their Treatise
under a straynge name
Then may I by right
(me thyncke) do the same
Wherefore though I touth the
take it in good part,
For I will the none Ill
as God knows mine heart.
I grant I have feyned
and written a lie,
And yet not so loud
as I would it were,
For treuly this Gigant
great Philargyrie
Is present in great Brytayne
even every where
Not one man is free
From his Tyranny there,
For all men he polled
first by Hypocrisy,
And now by self Love
he does all destroy.
The Hypocrites had gotten
into their own hands
All placis of Pleasure
in every coaste
So had they the good
and profitable lands
Which now by self love
are spoiled and lost
No good thing at all
remains welmoste
The thyngis that were best
are now made so bad
That where much thing is
there naught can be had.
The Hypocritis were Ill
but worsse is self love
Wherefore gentle Reader
I pray the hertily
Make ernest petition
to the Lord above
To deliver great Britain
from Philargyrie
Who has brought that rich Island
into such misery
That things of greatist plenty
are scantist to be had
And al thing that good was
is now made to bad.

Unto such as be yet without All thyngis shall be spoken in Parables. Mark.
iiii.
The fable of Philargyrie ye great Gigant of great Britain, what houses were
^uilded and lands appointed for his prou^^i^ns, and how all the same is wasted
to content his gredie gut wythall and yet he rages for honger
Give ear a while
And mark my style
You yt has wit in store
For with words bare
I will declare
Things done long time before
Sometime certain
Into Britayne
A land full of plenty
A Gyaunte great
Came to seek meat
Whose name was Philargyrie
He was so strong
That none emonge
That brutyshe nation
Durst take in hand
Him to wythstande
In any station
That curssed ladde
A fre course had
That Island over all
Boeth vale and hy^^
Were at his will
With towns both great and small
Then let he cry
That low and hye
That would to him resort
Should still endure
In all pleasure
And live in play and sport
So that they would
Do as they should
And honor him as God
With Baggis of gold
In many fold
In number even or odd
Come unto me
Who so will (quoth he)
There shall no law him bind
I will him make
Free for to take
All thyngis that he can find
Force and strong hand
By sea and land
Shall be his law and right
He shall be bold
To take and hold
Al thyngis by force and might
So that he bring
To me some thing
I will defend him still
None so hardye
Him to deny
Or to say he does Ill
When this was known
And a broad blown
Throughout that Island wide
From every port
Men did resort
To him on every side
So that anon
A Legion
Were ready at his will
To do all thing
At his bidding
Whether it were good or Ill
Then forth he stood
With full mylde mode
Desiring them silence
Till he had told
All that he would
Unto that Audience
Philargyries Oration.
GOod syrs (quoth he)
Full well I se
That ye have been oppressed
Long time with laws
Not worth two strawes
But that shall be redreste
Henseforth there shall
No law at all
Restrain your Liberty
But that you may
Boeth night and day
Do your own will freely
Catch what you can
From every man
And hold it for your own
Reap, let me se
And bring to me
That other men have sown
And when you find
Ought to your mind
That force can not bring in
Then beat your brain
About some train
Whereby you may it win
Se nothing let
You forto get
All things into your hand
Which other men
Must now and then
Needs have by sea or land.
Then set the price
Above all syse
Your bags therwyth to fill
Make the vile slaves
And paysant knaves
Pay you at your own will.
And where you spy
Commodity
There plant your dwelling place
And then employe
Your whole study
To get it up apase
And by each port
Where is resort
Se that ye do conueye
All manner thing
Whereof might spring
Profit to this country
For so shall ye
Enriched be
And have money in store
For you shall sell
Thyngis twyse so well
As men did heretofore.
The woule, the lead
The corn for breadde
The bear butter and cheese
Will be well sold
Wherefore be bold
By them you can naught leese.
Metalle of Bellis
Lether and fellis
And woulsted yarne also
Are redye gold
Let them be sold
With thyngis a thousand more
And if you may
Convey away
These thyngis beyond ye foam
Then shall the pryse
Of that arise
That shall be left at home
You must therefore
Have evermore
All those thyngis in your hand
Wherein the spring
Of every thing
And first increase does stand.
The pasture grownde
That feadeth sound
You must in no case lack
All manner mines
And myllis that gryndis
Must help to fill your sack
Copsis of wodde
Be very good
For you to have in hand
You must needs have
Great fermes a thraue
With all good fruitful lands.
Short tale to make
You must all take
And whorde up still in store
Till that be scant
Whereof no want
Was ever seen before.
Draffe is plenty
Yet certainly
If it were handled well:
It would be sold
For ready gold
And that some men can tell
The time has been
That men could win By smoke and by Vryne
And why should not
Gain rise of that
Where with me^ feed their swine?
Se to all thing
Whereof may spring
Any Lucre or Guyne,
For Gain does smell
Exceeding well
In every thing certain.
I will therefore
Now say no more
But se you do apply
Your busynes
To get richesse
My mind to satisfy.
You must me feed
Aye at my need
With bags of most pure gold
For I could eat
None other meat
Sense I was two days old.
A God am I
That can not dye
Wherefore I must be fed
With gold most pure
That will endure
And not with bryckle bread
Bring, bring bring, bring
Always some thing,
And then you shall me please.
All that is sold
For ready gold
Does my stomach much ease.
And as you will
Continue still
Al your days in pleasure
Even so apply
You busily
With gold me to honor
I am your God
And have the rod
Of honger in my fyste
Wherefore take heed
Ye do me feed
With gold that is fynest
And him that can
Best play the man
In getting gold and fe
I will promote
And set aflote
In wealth and high degree
And in the end
I will him send
To Plutos dwelling place
Were he shall be
Next unto me
Wherefore, gather apase
Dixi, quoth he
And bowed his knee
Unto his audience
Thankyng them all
Boeth great and small
For their quiere scilence
How the people of Britain beca^^ subject to Philargyrie.
THen with one voice
All did rejoice
And clapped their hands apas^
And after that
They fell all flat
Prostrate before his face
Then rose they up
And in a cup
Of gold, they did him bring
More thousandis than
Any man can
Well express by writing
Then began they sing
Behold we bring
Our mornetydis sacrifice
Desiring the
That it may be
Pleasant before thine eyes
Then forth he raught
His hand, and caught
The cup full of pure gold
should at one sup
He drancke it up
Thankyng them many fold
Henseforth, quoth he
Look that you be
With me thryse in the day
With such a sup
In such a cup
That I do not decay
And be ye bold
To get the gold
As I have said before
No law shall let
You forto get
So much, and ten times more
All trembling then
One of his men
Fell flat upon his face
And desired
To be pardoned
To speak his mind a space
Stand up quoth he
What so thou be
And tell to me thy name
Thou shall have grace
To speak a space
Thou shalt sustain no blame
Dear Sovereign
Quoth he again
I am Hypocrisy
There is on mould
No man that would
Serve you lever then I
But this one thing
My Lord and king
If I might be so bold
To say my mind
A fault I find
In that which you have told
Say on, quoth he
I pardon the
Let me know all thy thought.
If thy counsel
Do like me well
It shall in deed be wroughte
Then manerly
He made curchy
As one that could his good
With mylde wordis than
Thus he began
Before them as he stood
Hypocrisies Oration.
MY Lord and king
This is the thing
That does my mind offend
And causes me
Thus bold to be
Trustyng you will it mende
You have us told
We should be bold
To take all at our will
And spoil the rich
And pore alyche
Our baggis with gold to fill
But well I wotte
This thing will not
Be suffered any while
Except that we
Work subtyltee
And get their goodis by gyle
We must pretend
Some holy end
That may the people please
And so we shall
Be Lordis of all
And fyl our baggis with ease
Send me to preach
And I will teach
The people over all
That they shall lie
In purgatory
After their death fatal
I will them tell
That pains in Hell
And pains there are a lone
Save that of this
An end there is
But of the other none
Then that they may
Be sure always
To crepe out at their will
I will them tell
We have to sell
Pardone of all their Ill
So they will bring
To us althynge
Whereof we shall stand ned^
Houses to build
Boeth thackt and tylde
And bye us fode and wede
Then will I prove
It does behoue
That we have land and rent
That we may pray
For them always
To God omnipotent
And when they lie
Ready to dye
Then will I be at hand
Forto declare
How hard we fare.
For lack of rent and land.
Then will I tell
The pains of Hell
And purgatory fire
And what great pain
They shall sustain
Unless they do us hyre
For we are they
That fast and pray
For them that give us ought
And our doing
Is worth nothing
Unless it be dear bought
Now when they se
Them selfs to be
Set in so great distress
With all their heart
They will depart
With much of their riches
In hope that we
Will factours be
For them, when they begone
And by this train
We shall obtain
Great landis and goodis anon
For what is he
That will not be
Glad to redeem with gold
His soul, which he
Shall thyncke to be
Dampened a thousand fold?
And specially
When he shall dye
And leave all things byhynde
For if he would
Then whorde up gold
He can not have his mind
I will I trow
In some ears blow
So terrible a blaste
That they shall quake
And for fear make
Us their heirs at the last
Yea Kyngis with crowns
Shall give us towns
And Cities to be sure
That we shall pray
For them allwaye
Whylse the world shall endure
Thus shall we have
All that we crave
And much more at our will
Our selfs to feed
As we shall need
And give you gold your fill
Dixi, he said
And then he prayed
Philargyrie of grace
And then with that
He fell down flat
Prastrate before his face
How Philargyrie commits the Governance of all his Subjects to Hypocrisy.
FVll myldly than
This God began
And bade his man arise
Stand up, quoth he
For well I se
Thou art prudent and wise
Wherefore with me
Thou shalt chief be
I will work by thy read
And all that be
Subject to me
Thou shalt govern and lead
Then let he cry
That low and hye
That would take him as king
Should with all speed
Fulfill in deed
Hypocrisies bydynge
For he is wise
And can dyuise
Ways to get gold and fe
And make men fill
With right good will
Your baggis to bring to me
Then all that were
Present to hear
That proclamasion
Showed them content
With full assent
And thus they said each one,
Hypocrisy
Is most worthy
To rule under our king
For he can preach
And men so teach
That they will gladly bring
Then went there out
A full great route
From Philargyries place
And by and by
Hypocrisy
Began to preach apace
All manner men
Were ready then
To give even what he would
They were so mad
They thought he had
Salvation to be sold
Then builded he
A great City
Nodnoll he did it name
It was all one
With Babylon
If it were not the same
In that City
Then Bylded he
A temple to his God
Setting therein
Of his own kyne
An hundred Knights and odd.
The Arch knight was
Byshope Chayphas
Who rode with spear and shyld
Haueynge his corse
Armed with force
To cause all men to yield
Then in each place
That pleasante was
He planted houses sure
Of lyme and stone
They were echone
Because they should endure
Bulwarkis also
A thousand more
Then any man can tell
To beat them down
That ware the crown
If they did once rebel
So was that land
Whole in the hand
Of Philargyries men
No wight was free
From them if he
Were worth pore shyllyngs ten
But to couloure
His endeavor
He did those places name
Houses for clerks
And the bulwarckes
Lodgyngis for blind and lame
Then poynted he
That there should be
Leches of wondrous skyll
In every plare
Who in short space
Should help their bags to fill
At Walsyngehame
Was Noterdame
At Elye good Audrye
And at Wylsedon
Were great cures done
By bolstryng of Baudrye
At Hayles there was
One in a glass
That wrought wounders full great
And at Wynchcome
Were cured some
That could Keuelme intrea
There were also
A thousand more
Leaches of his poyntynge
That could heal all
Boeth great and small
That would any thing bring
They would not stycke
To heal the sick
In body and in soul
They had such wit
They could do it
By drynckynge of a bole
When this was done
Then was al wone
They need to seek no more
They had all thing
At their liking
To spend and keep in store
Hypocrisy
Thought then to stye
Up to Nodnoll anon
To se what was
There brought to pass
After he was thense gone
But ere he went
More gold he sent
To his God Philargyrie
Then thousandis ten
Of brutysh men
Could bare, to make him merry
Wych he eat up
All at one sup
And yet was not content
But said that they
Had by the way
Spent some of that was sent
Al ragynge than
This God began
On them his wrath to wreake
He laid about
Emonge the route
Till none of them cold speak.
And when he had
Like one half mad
Slain all that company
In all his rage
He calde his page
Who came forth by and by
Come on (quoth he)
I will go see
What provision thereis
They shall it bye
Full dear if I
Fare not better then this
Fetch forth my steed
Trusty at need
For now I am in haste
I must go try
Hypocrisy
And se if he make waste
His lad was priest
With his steed dreste
Ready For him to ride
And right anon
He leapt thereon
And would no longer bide
He ryd forth fast
Tyllat th e last
He came to I gralk place
Where he did spy
Hypocrisy
Fyllynge his bags apase
Then laughed he
And said I se
Hypocrisy is just
Naught can him let
Treasure to get
To satisfy my lust
Hypocrisy
Heard by and by
His Lord and masters voice
And ganne to sing
To leap and spring
So much he did rejoice.
All smylyngly
Philargyrie
Then began his man embrace
And said my son
How haste thou done
Sense thou wast at my place
My Lord said he
And bowed his knee
I have had good success
For all this land
Is in my hand
With infinite richesse.
Then said he come
You shall se some
Of that I have in store
Take you your fill
Of what you will
There comes in daily more,
Then with a keye
He made his way
Into his treasury
Where was more gold
I dare be bold
The^ would in poulis church ly
How Philargyrie deuored all the treasure that Hypocrisy had laid up in
store.
Full hungerly
Philargyrie
Began then forto eat
Even as he had Been more then mad
For lack of needful meat.
Goblettes of gold
Went down twofolde
So did owches and ryngis
Tablettis with stones
Made for the nonce
With many other thyngis
So fast he eat
That he ganswere
As it had been a bull
Ten tun I wot
Went down his throat
And yet he was not full
Then carefully
Hypocrisy
Bethought him of his store
And with words wise
He did advise
His lord to eat no more
It shall, quoth he
Right healthful be
To leave with Appetite
For all fulness
Does cause syckenes
As Phisickes masters write
Yea sir, quoth he
But when I se
That sycknes does me prick
I can be bold
For ready gold
To have present Physic
Wherefore I will
Now eat my fill
There shall nothing me let
Therefore be gone
Let me alone
I must live by my meat
Full Heavily
Hypocrisy
Then took leave to depart
And said Adiu
Much good do it you
But thought it not in heart
With boeth handis than
This God began
To crambe into his crawe
Till all the gold
Whereof I told
Was mowed up in his mawe
Than sat he down
And began to frown
As not content in mind
Because no more
Was left in store
And he had not half dynde
Then up he rose
And cast the nose
Alofte into the wind
Even as a swyne
Holds up the groyne
When he would fedyng find
Come on, quoth he
For well I se
Here is no meat in store
Hypocrisy
Will him aply
I thyncke to get in more
Then home he went
Half mysse content
And laid him down to rest
But he could get
No sleep quiet
To fasten in his breast
How Hypocrisy went about to wythstande Philargyrie,
IN this mean space
Hypocrisy was
At Nodnoll, full busy
Some way to find
Him self to wind
Out of that misery
Thus did he cast
Then at the last
In his disceytefull thought
I will, thought he
Liberal be
Of that which cost me naught
As many as will
Shall have their fill
Of meat and drynck with me
Boeth low and hye
Shall have plenty
Of fode, with gold and fe.
So shall I keep
With them frendshype
And have them on my side
With al their heart
To take my part
What so shall me bytyde
Full well I know
That hye and low
Will take part of my chere
For in each coaste.
Boeth sodde and roste
Are waxen very dear
And it is like
That they will stycke
To me always at need
For houndis are wont
Freshly to hunte
For them that do them feed,
And so I say
I shall always
Be able to wythstande
That wicked wight
If he will fight
Either by sea or land
Then by and by
He did employe
Him felfe to make good chere
And for to spend
By the years end
All that came in by year.
This did allure
I am right sure
The hertes of thousandis ten
To be ready
To live and dye
With him like faithful men
Then was he bold
And thought he could
Withsta^de his masters might
He did therefore
Keep naught in store
For him as he had plyght
Great fees he gave
An hundred thraue
To men that had no need
For well knew he
That it must be
Such that must do the deed
How self love uttered Hyyocrisie his intent to Philargyrie
THen was there one
That did anon
Conceive his wole intent
And in a night
He did him dyght
And to Ppilargyrie went
He went so fast
And made such haste
For fear to come to late
That long ere day
He rydde the way
And was come to the gate
Full fiersly than
To knock he began
As one that would come in
Till the wycket
Was open set
To knock he would not blinne
Then came forth one
To him anon
And said what haste is this?
Say on quoth he
Declare to me
What thy busynes is
Sir, quoth the freke
I must nedis speak
With my lord Philargyrie
I can him tell
All is not well
About Hypocrisy
Then ran the page
As one in rage
Unto the chaumber door
And at one pushe
He did it rushe
Down flat into the flore
With that awoke
That God and shoke
His lockis yt were full thynne
What may this
Sir knave (quoth he)
That thou come so fast in:
Upon his knee
Then kneled he
(So well he could his good)
And myldly than
Thus he began
With a most heavy mode
My Lord, he said
I am a frayed
Our heavy news to tell
For fear that ye
Should angry be
And take it nothing well
News? quoth he than
And bade his man
Tell him without delay.
Speak man, quoth he
What ayleth the
Why do thou make this stay?
Then at the last
His man out braste
And in few wordis he said
Surely there is
Some thing amysse
Some man has you betrayde
Betrayed, quoth he,
How may that be?
And then in hand he took
His bostarde bright
So goodly dyght
And began fiersly to look
Tell me quoth he
Who it should be
That has this treason wrought
That I may wreke
Me on the freke
And bring his stock to naught
Hypocrisy
I thyncke treuely
Quoth Philargyries men
For one came now
To speak with you
And thus the freke began.
I must, quoth he
If it may be
Speak with Philargyrie
I can him tell
All is not well
About Hypocrisy
Than the God bade
Fech in that ladde
That I may here him speak.
Full lightly than
His saruant ran
And brought to him the freake.
Full manerly
He made curchie
And lowted to the grownde
Than said the lad
I am right glad
I have your lordshipe found
For I have spyed
And thoroughly tried
Thingis by Hypocrisy
Which do declare
That he does bear
Grudge to your majesty
For certainly
Hypocrisy
Has now in his own hand
The half welmoste
In every coaste
Of this pleasant Island
And does employe
Him busily
There with forto obtain:
All men's good will
That he may still
In this rich Island raygne
He goes about
To have a route
Knytte to him in frendeshyp:
And to that end
He does intend
A right great house to keep,
He will therefore
Keep naught in store
For you to feed upon,
He will all spend
By the years end
That he may lay hands on
And if you would
Do what you could
To recover your right
The loselles shall
Be ready all
In his quarrel to fight
Wherefore I say
Invent some way
Betyme, for this myschyefe,
Else certainly
You shall shortly
Lack your needful relyefe
Then curtesly
Philargyrie
Thanked this man and said
Ten thousand pound
In nobles rownde
Thou shall have treuly payede
Tell me thy name
And I shall frame
My ways after thy skyll
For I se well
Thou canste me tell
Ways to escape this Ill.
Dear sir quoth he
My name has be
Philaute sense I was borne,
Hypocrisy
Is clombe so hye
That my stock is nygh worn
Well said he than
Be content man
I will thy stock restore
For thou shall be
Chief under me
As Hypocrisy was before
I have no dread
But by thy read
I shall bring it to pass
That, that vile slave
And wicked knave
Shall be brought down full base
Tell me therefore
If any store
Of counsel do remaye
What way we may
Best porue and say
To subdue this vylayn
My Lord, quoth he
If it so be
That ye will, as you say
Take my counsel
Then know ye well
I thyncke this the best way.
Let me be sent
To preach in Lent
And out of Lent also:
And I shall draw
Them from his awe
I trust with small ado
I will declare
How mad they are
To give him of their good
To be made just
Sens all men must
Be made just by Christis blood
For though he ring
Great belles and sing
A thousand masses and more
Yet must Christis blood
Shed on the rode
Deliver all men from woe
Then you shall give
Each man good leave
To wytholde what he can
From that vile slave
That does still crave
A flyse of every man.
They must be bold
All to wytholde
And eke to take him fro
Boeth land and fee
Where so it be
And rych Iewelles also.
When this is told
You may be bold
All men will be full priest
Your part to take
And him forsake
And then the knave is dreste,
Let me alone,
There shall not one
Hold on his side I trow
After they do
Once hearken to
The blaste that I shall blow.
With words myry
Then Philargyrie
Said, be it as thou have told
To use thy skyll
At thine own will
Thou may hensefore be bold
Be thou, quoth he
Next unto me
And eke my cosen dear
Henseforth certain
In all Britayne
There shall not be thy pear
And all that be
Kynne unto the
Be it never so small
I will promote
And set aflote,
Cosens I will them call
Now sweet Kynsman
Do what you can
That Vylaynes will to let
And get me gold
Either new or old
Else shall I starve for meat
For I had not
My fill I wot
This hundred years and more
Which causes me
So leave to be
That scarsely I can go
Hold you content
It is now lent
You must needs fast a while.
Lenten quoth he
Lent let it be
And then he began to smyle
With that began
Philaute his man
To demand with words mild
What thing might be
The cause that he
When Lent was named smyld
Oh Couse qouth he
The time has be
That I have eat more gold
In one short lent
Then some have spent
In fyftie wynters cold
For certainly
Hypocrisy
Did in lent most provide
Good gold to feed
Me at my need
In every time and tide.
But let that go
He does not so
Now, well he shall repent
You will I trow
Couse bring him low
Before an other Lent
Yea sir, quoth he
Sure ye shall be
I will so bring him down
That the vile knave
Shall nothing have
In field nor yet in town
Let us therefore
Now talk no more
I must this matter plye
It shall be best
For you to rest
Whylse I to Nodnoll stye
Go you to bed
And lay your head
Upon a pyllowe fine
I trust to get
You golden meat
Ere it be time to dyne.
Couse go thy way
That God began say
God pluto be thy speed
My sprite shall be
Present with the
To help the aye at need
My lord, quoth he
It shall best be
That no man does is know
Wherefore let not
Your servants wot
Lest they some rumors sow
For I must preach
And al men teach
That gods son has me sent
For so shall I
Have by and by
My purpose and intent
Couse, thou shall se
I warant the
All shall be kept secret
For counsels known
And abroad blown
Will our procedyngis let
Depart therefore
And say no more
For I know al thy mind
Thou shall well se
That I will be
As reasone does me bind
Then louted he
With either knee
And said, my lord Adiu
The God of sleep
Vouchsalfe to keep
All that belong to you
How Philargyrye went to Nodnol and what he did there.
THen forth he went
As he was sent
Till he to Nodnoll came
Where by and bye
He made outecrie
Against Hypocrisies name
Give ear to me
All you, quoth he
That do your own wealth love
For gods own son
Did bid me run
Your enmie to remove.
Hypocrisy
Has dealt flasely
With you full many a year
To gather pelf
And keep him self
In ease and bealy chere.
Do you not se
How greasye he
And his be, and how fat?
His chekes be bolne
And for fat swollen,
His nose is cowched flat
He walloweth in
That fylthy sin
Of gredy glottonnye
He will not swynke
For meat nor drink
But live still Idellye
Yet will he eat
Naught but fine meat
And drink of the best wine
Who so has been
With him has seen
His fare to be right fine
I grant he will
Your bealies fill
Till your backis can not bow
But all that is
Nothing of his
But byggis of your own sow
Open your eyes
If you be wise
And se to your own gain
Let not this slave
The riches have
That you have got wtih pain
You need not pass
For his vain mass
His diryge and prayars long
For well we see
All those thyngis be
But labor of the tongue
Your self can pray
As well always
As he, and also feed
All such as ye
Shall know to be
Pore and nedie in deed
His prayars shall
Help none at all
Christis blood has paid the price
You need therefore
To do no more
That one price does suffice.
What madness than
Is in that man
That will so much bestow
Upon a thing
Worsse then nothing?
No man is so mad It row
How the people forsook Hypocrisy.
THe people anon
Much mused on
These words that seemed straynge
Yet did they embrace
Them, in short space
Because they love to chaynge
And naturally
You know pardie
Each man will love him self
Then a small thing
May him sone bring
In love with this worlds pelf
The brutes therefore
Took Philautis lore
And left Hypocrisy
Then range the bell
To a Counsel
That thing to ratify.
In this Synnodde
Ten score and odd
Took Hypocrisies part
Yet all they lost
For all their boaste
In dispyte of their heart
It was decreed
There and agreed
That Philaute should possess
For ever more
Hypocrisy store
His lands and his riches.
Then Philaute sent
In contient
Ten thousand tons of gold
To Philargyrie
To make him miry
Therewith, what time he would
In short time than
His store began
To waste and wear apase
For he eat still
And could not fill
His paunch, in.vii. years spase
Then Philaute fed
His God with lead
With stones, and with timber
And told him that
Gold was to fat
For men that fast Imber.
You must, quoth he
Contented be
With such as does remain,
Ye must forbear
This preciouse gear
Yet for a year or twain
Then Philaute sold
For ready gold
Fortes that were builded strong
And made so sure
Forto endure
That they had stand full long
Great lands also
Philaute let go
For gold that was full fine
And sent it all
To Philargyries hall
For him therwyth to dyne
But all was gone
And spent anon
And he looked for more
But yet in vain
For naught certain
Remained then in store
Well thought he than
I trow I can
Make right fine gold of bras
And so he did
But it framed
Full euel as resone it was
Well, yet he sent
And raised rent
From five grotes to a pound
Yet was there not
Much wone by that
For more was lost then found
Well thus at the last
All hope was paste.
His God he could not fyl
Unless he should
Be found so bold
The king and his reame to syl
Then began this God
To take the rode
Of hunger in his fyst
And said that he
Would filled be
No man should him resist.
Then with strokes sore
He smote the pore
And then they began to cry
To god almyght
For them to fight
Against Philargyrie
How Truth told all to the king.
But then took truth
Pity and ruth
And to the king he went
And said sir king
Amend this thing
Thy realm else wylbe shent
Philargyrie
Hypocrisy
And Philaute have spent all
Thy people are
So full of care
That now to god they call.
Vengeance therefore
Is at thy door
Ready the to destroy
Unless thou will
Purge out the Ill
That does thy flock anoye
An horrible thing
It is sir king
To fall into godis hand
Thou may trust me
No man can be
Able him to wythstande
Take heed therefore
Suffer no more
These fell felons to raygne
Lest God almyght
For thy stock fight
And thou thy self be slain
What though they be
Myghtie to se?
Yet fear not thou at all
For (God no doubt)
Will rowte them out
If thou wylt on him call
For he has said
He will the aid
Against his enemies
If thou wylt go
Forth straight and do
Thyngis pleasant in his eyes
How the king drove that wicked sort out of his realm
With that the king
For fear began spring
Unto the Bible book
And by and by.
Right reverently
That sword in hand he took
No wight, quoth he
Shall spared be
That does my flock oppress
God has me set
Such thyngis to let
And all wrongis to redress
Then let he cry
That low and hye
In whom gods fear did dwell
Should never rest
But do they best
Gods enmies to expel
Then fell he down
And cast his crown
And diadem aside
And lokyng on hye
Up to the sky
To God aloude he cried
Lord God, quoth he
Thou have chosen me
Over thy flock to raygne
Make me of might
All wrongis to right
And make all well again
Then God him sent
Men that were bent
Oppression to expel
Who chased out
This gygante stout
And then all things were w^
Finis.
