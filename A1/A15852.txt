A Young man's most earnest affection to his Sweetheart. Expressed in a dainty
Courtly Sonnet: First read and hear it, then censure upon it. To a curious new
Northern tune.


COme come my Dear that art so pretty,
li^^^d my suite and y^ld some pity,
For all the world shall nere r^moue me,
Until the ^ay I die I vow to love thee:
And all the birds in every valley.
Will gladly sing the praise of Jack and Dolly.
Thy rare perfection I admire,
Thy company I do desire,
Thy presence y^^lds to me such pleasure,
I would not miss thy sight for any treasure.
Be thou my sweeting constant ever,
And I in love will still persevere:
The Ocean sooner shall be dried,
Than my firm love to thee shall be denied.
Let me enjoy thy lovely presence.
Which I do hold my earthly essence,
And with reciprocal affe^tion
I will be constant to my ^^rst election.
Though both my parents* friends and kindred
Seek^ means to have my meaning hindered,
I will not change my resolution*
Though I were sure the same were my confusion
Thou (...) desire in haste to marry.
Yet if I were constrained to tarry
A doozen years for that happy meeting,
patiently would stay for thee my sweeting.
Then let not thy affections wau^r,
^ut let me still retain thy favor:
Be not unkind nor fickle minded,
My heart has found more woe then ever thine (...)
I many proff^rs have refused,
Whereat my friends hau^ greatly mused:
When I think on thee that so surpasses,
Then for thy sake I loath all other ^asses.
Me thinks thy sparkling eyes I see still,
Which is a comfort unto me still,
I dreamin^ see thy shadow nightly,
And waking with to see the substance rightly.
Thy body is straight, small and sl^nde^,
Thy skin is white, smooth, so^^ and tender:
Thy leg and foot is framed neatly,
And all thy lineaments are made completely.
The Poet with his witty phrases,
Will gladly write thy pretty praises,
And all the Birds in every valley.
Will gladly sing the praise of Jack and Dolly.
The Second part. To the same tune.


ANd as thou prop^r a^t and pretty
So art then courteous prompt and witty,
Both Art and Nature a^^ co^^ined.
To make o^ th^^ a pei^e of E^r^d refined.
And all the birds in every valle.
Will gladly sing the praise of Jack and Dolly.
How can I then be discontented?
Or why should my choice be pr^uented?
Though thou ha^st not one copper T^^en,
I Will not rec^nt the words that I have spoken.
I might have riches out of measure,
But what care I for worldly treasure?
(...) me a ^asse endowed by nature,
I Will labor hard or beg for such a treasure.
No tortures that man can endure,
Shall make my fancy prove impure:
(...) parents frown, nor friends reproving,
(...) make my settled mind to be removing.
Thou ^^th my permanent affection
^^^^its it self to thy direction,
Let not thy heart* my only swee^ing,
( Like Cresida) be mutable or fl^^ting.
Be thou like Hero to Leand^r,
Let not thy thoughts like H^lens wander,
To leave thy first Lou^ for a (...).
Duplicity in choice has still br^d danger.
That which twixt faithful friends is ^^wed,
^'th Court of heaven is allowed,
And he or she that the same ^^^ringeth.
Must know yt such contempt great love auenge^*
But why seem I to m^sdoubt thy doing,
No just ^^^^ion by thee knowing?
No, though I speak all this in passion,
I dare be sworn thou has'st all of that fashion.
Then be not thou my Dear offended,
Nor let thy angry brow be bended:
Yet if thou speak to thee I Will be beholding.
I love to hear thy voice, though it be in scolding.
Then be thou constant in thy carriage,
Until that we be linkt in marriage,
Then farewell ^a^e and melancholy*
Since l^ckie has possessed his dearest Dolly.
And all the Birds in every va^l^y.
Will sweetly si^g in praise of Jack and Dolly.
FINIS.
