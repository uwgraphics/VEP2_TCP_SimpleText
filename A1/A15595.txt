FINIS.



THE LAST BLAST OF THE TROMPET OF Godis word aganis the vsurpit authority of
Iohne Knox and his Caluiniane brether intrudit Precheouris etc.

Put forth to the Congregatioun of the Protestantis in Scotla^de, be Niniane
Winet, ane Catholic priest borne in Renfrew:

At the desire and in the name of his afflictit Catholic brether of ye
inferior ordoure of Clergy, and laic men.

Vir impius procaciter obfirmat vultum suum: qui autem rectus est, corrigit
uiam suam.

Proverb. 21. Edinburgi vltimo Iulij. 1562.

Ane Submonitioun to the reder.
THe cause quhy we haif intitulit yis tractate on the manner preceding, is: that
we first soundit the trompet of godis word* twiching this purpose in three
questions specialie, amangis money ma proponit to Iohne Knox and his brether,
and delyuerit to him in name of yam al. Quhilkis we iugeit sufficient occasion
to any man in quhome had been the feir of god, to examinat him self, and to
wtdraw him fra ye rolkis of error and arrogance in this matter. And secundlie
quhen this fornamit Iohne was not mouit thairby, bot erar puffed vpe with mair
pride, intendit to preue his vocation planelie in ye pulpet (bot quhat strenth
had his armor of defense their, lat cunning me^ judge quha hard him) we blew
the samyn trompet again in three wrytingis according to his preching on sindry
dayis: and yat verray schortlie as it had been be three sindry so^ndis blawin
almast at ane time. Be ye quhilks albeit he was abaissit, Hebre. 4.
and woundit in conscience before god (quhais word is mair peirceand tha^ any
two aigeit sword etc.) it ye wylfull blyndnes and obstinat arrogance leidand
all prouersit erroneus men as captiuis and bunde presoneris, haldis him and his
brether sa fetterit, as it war with certane strange chenis of Irne, that they will
not it descend in thaim selfis to humility and penance: bot indurit as Pharao
wthaldis the people of god in thraldu^ aganis his expres co^ma^d and approuin
ordinance. Quhair for ye the blind of thaim and their scoleris be not impute
till us in ye sycht of god, for not schawing our brother lie lufe to thaim, in
admonising of their error and perrell: we put forth this third and last
blaste, to call abak the scoleris from ye plaig of godis justice, as we callit
(as we mycht) their techaris before: think and this to be sufficient
aduertisme^t to al thaim quha hes earis to heir ye treuth, yat we neid not in
this matter any ofter to sound this trompet.

Reid and Judge. To the Congregatioun of the Protestantis in Scotland.
QVHILL we are aluterlie irkit, honorable and deirbelouit, we haif kep it
silence, almaist aganis our conscience, sen the twelft of March, awaityng on
Iohne Knox answeir in writ, of his lauchfull vocatioun, according to his
promis maid in the pulpet to our last writtyng, delyuerit to him yat day
thairupon. Quhilk promis sen he another fulfyllis (another ane^tis this, nor our
other questionis) nor it he nor his brether desistis fra vsurpinge sa hie ane
office, to the quhilk they can nocht schaw thaim lauchfullie callit conform to
godis ordinance, nor it make any answeir thairin without their schame (as we are
peruadit*) except they godly schaw their repentance: We may not bot pray and
beseik our prudence for the health and saifing of our awin saulis, that e reid,
consider and judge sinceirlye without all affectioun our questionis and
answeris maid to Iohne Knox declaratioun thairupon. And exhortis ow alswa gyf e
may collect forth of the Euangell any defece be precept or exemple, to assure
us of our precheouris lauchfull vocatioun: that e assiste to thaim thairwith,
and make the samyn patent till us: Quhair by that e and we sum time brether of
ane kirk, may be to gidder, it obedient brether but schism and discord, to
the Prphetis and ministeris of god (of our precheouris we meine) fra they be
knawin vndouttitlie to be send be him. Bot faileing thairof (as we hope e sall)
we exhort ow in the bowelis of JESUS Christ our only Saluiour and Mediator
that e set aside all blind affectioun, and auert our earis fra the sweit venum
of deuyllish eloquence of wordis, and begin to feir and trimbe at the feirfull
exemplis of deid in Core and his cumpanie, Number. 16.
and of ye proud king Osias quha temeruslie in his arrogance ingerit him self,
2. Par. 26.
to make sacrifice at the altar of God, wtoute all lauchfull vocatioun
thairto. For of their dais now prensent aduertissis ow, Jude. 1.
nocht we, bot the Apostle Jude. Woo be to thaim (sayis he) quha in the
rebellioun and tressoun of Core hes perissit. And give e think their exemplis
nocht sufficient to persuade ow, quhilkes we haif writtin to Iohne Knox in
otheris tractatis: remember alsua may effectuouslie we ou pray, 1. Kng. 13.
yt for vsurpyng Samuelis office, as for ane falt in special, king Saul was
repellit fra his kingdom. The mercy of god stay, yt we and e for defending of
sic misordour, be not repellit fra our native possessionis heir, and after fra
our kingdom eternale. Quhat? sulde nocht the arrogance and murmuring of Maria
the sister of Moses, with Aaron, and ye foul lippre quhairwith schowes plagit
thairfor, stryk ow with feit? Quha murmuring aganis Moses, and ascriuing
authority to her self, without all lauchfull vocatioun thairto, Number. 12.
(as our precheouris dois prese^tlie) said this: hes god spokin be Moses
only? hes he not spoki^siclik to us? Eui^ as our prophets sais now* Have we
not science knaulege, and vndsta^di^g ye gift of god? Quhy ar we not
thairthrow, but farther authority orordinatio^, 3. Reg. 14*
lauchfull pastores Bischopis and prelatis? Ibid. 12. and 11.
Reid and consider siclyke to quhat miserable end Hieroboam was brocht for his
wickit consaitis and doingis* causing ye Isralites nocht to pass to
Hiersualem, to make sacrifice to god, quhair the Arcke, Tabernakle, and prestis
(as in the town quhilk god peculiarly had elect) was appoyntit than to remane:
and nocht chesing the preistis of the tribe of Leui according to godis special
command, bot passing with the people to Bethel and Dan, and their offerit
sacrifice to strainge goddis, electing be his authority aganis the ordinace of
god, ane confusioun of wickit prestis of quhat sumeuer Tribe thairto. Mark and
observe with all diligence we exhort our prudence in the name of our lord Jesus,
gif e haif folowit Hieroboa^ i^ like manner or nocht: drawing ye people and our
selfis, fra our true Jerusalem godis haly kirk universal (out of ye quhilk
yair is na sacrifice of prayer, Cant. 6.
loving, or rychteousnes plesand to god) to Bethel and dan to the private
conuenticules of Schismatikis and heretikis: and give e have their maid
sacrifice to falls godis: yt is alsua (as ancient fatheris godly exponis it)
hes embraceit falls and erroneus doctrine, vincent.
for the treuth: hes worschippit, and adornit erroures, Lirinen,
hereseis and leis for the eternal verity of godis word: and that e mycht
haif our awin consaitis wicketlie fulfyllit, consider give e prurientes
auribus hes not electit preistis and precheoures, 2. Timo. 4.
and heipit up masteris to our selfis: not discending of the tribe of Leui: Io.
20.
That is not succeding to the Apostles and their successouris after ye ordinace
appoyntit be the word of god. Act. 2.6.13, 14.
And gyf al their terrouris may nocht mollify our hartis to know our just
motiones: 1. Timo. 5.
Tit. 1.
and that ordinare authority and obedience thairto quhilk Christ hes left i^
his kirk be his Apostlis and yair successors: Aduert we pray ow and mark the
office of ane bischope to be sa hie and sa excellent, that our Saluiour self
tuke not that office upon him without the lauchfull vocatioun of his heavenly
fader, as S. Paul writtis, Hebre. 5.
Euin sa Christ alsua glorifeit not him self to be maid the hie priest: Psalm.
2. and 109.
Bot he that said unto him: Thou art my son this day have I begottin the:
glorfeit him. As he sais in ane other place. Thou art ane priest for ever after
the ordour of Melchisedech. And sen e reding the haill new Testament sen
Christ, and ye historiis of al cuntreis, sensyne, findis na bischope, priest,
nor deacone institute, and ordanit be ye laic people in ye haly catholic kirk
bot be the Apostlis and their successouris bischopis alanerlie: Insamekle that
ye few in Diacones electit be the people to be steuartis specialie to ye pure in
godis kirk, Act. 6.
was presentit before the Apostlis and tuke their ordinatioun and power of
thaim: Ar e not affrait to auante samekle that e have godis word for ow, and
not we: and contrare the word of god sa express and salargelie put before our
eine to manteine and defend sic misprdoure? Will e not schaw ane authority of
godis word for our mii^sters vocation? Quhair find e ever any of the Apostlis
writting to the Romany, Corinthianis, or any other multitude commanding thaim
to constitute and ordinat bischope or other minister, as e may reide yat he
geuis express co^ma^d to ye bischopis, 1. Timo. 3. and 4.
Timothe and Tite, to use that power every ane off thaim seueralie. Tit 1.
Quhair reid e ever in the apostolis dais amang sa money thousand Christianis
turnit to the faith, or it sensyne any multitude of laic people allane to have
ordinatit ane bischope, priest, or diacone? Bot that we appeir nocht to deprive
any part of the kirk, me^bris off Christ of any dignity appoyntit to thaim in
the scripture. We confess (and to that glaidlye we assent) that the laic people
sumtyme hes electit sic persons, Act. 6.
as the sewin Diaconis before namit: and in the presence of the people the
bischopis to have been ordinatit: quha before had been co^monlie in the law of
grace, electit and presentit to the Comprouinciall Bischops be thaim, giving to
thaim testimony of their godly conversation, and consent of their favor to
thaim: as to sic personis quho^ eft they should reverence, both for their office
and haly leuing. Number. 20.
Sa institute Moses the Bischope Eleaarus on the hyech montane Hor before the
haill multitude: as before thaim quhay sulde testify alvvayis of his haly
life. Sa was Mathias ordinatit in the place of Judas in the middis of the
discipulis: Act. 1.
quhome before with Joseph thai head electit* On the quhilk place the haly martyr
Cypriane writtis this: Cyp. li. 1. epist. 4.
Quod vtique idcirco tam diligenter and caute, conuocata plebe tota gerebatur,
ne quis ad altaris ministerium, vel ad sacerdotalem locum indignus obreperet.
That is, quhilk thing verily yairfore was done sa dilige^tlie and warlie the
haill people being callit to gidder, yat na unworthy persoun mycht quietly
creip to the ministry off the altar: Ioh. Knox quhataltar is this? and quhat
priest?
or to the preistis roum. And in the samyn place contendis he: yat be ye
authority of godis word it should be obseruit, that the priest or bischope be
admittit, in ye p^sence of all the people, that he be haldin be the judgment and
witnessing of all to be worthy and apt to yat office: Electioun, and
ordinacion are not ane as it is pate^t abbe
Se ye people (sais he) hes special power to elect the worthy preistis, and to
refuse the unworthy. Heirfore sen the princes in our dayis takis on thaim the
haill power of electioun vote and suffrage of the people, presenting quhat
persoun they pleis, wald god yat their presentation war void of all symonie,
Act. ^.

and consent of ye people in every Diocesie and parrochin, according to the

Give any of ow will object that the prestis bischopis and ye clergy in our
dais hes been blekkit with the saidis deformiteis and sa ignorant or vicious, or
both, and alsua scladerous. yt they ar unworthy ye name of Pastores. Allace
we are rycht sort that this is treu for the may part, and mair. Bot wald e

Bot of the two proud princes dame Heresy and her sister we will not talk,
knawing that our mastres faithful simplicity, and lufe and lawrie, with their
