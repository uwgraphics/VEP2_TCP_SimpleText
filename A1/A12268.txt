Good Sir, you wrong your Britches, Pleasantly discoursed by a witty Youth, and
a wily Wench.
To the tune of Oh no, no, no, not yet: Or, I Will never love thee more.


A Young man and a Less of late,
within a Garden Ally,
As Cupid had commanded him,
began to court and dally:
She bade him have a special care,
he fell into no Ditches,
For so, (quoth she) the proverb says,
good Sir, you will wrong your Britches.
Thou art my only dearest love,
the Yongman then replide:
I will buy thee a silken gown,
a Petticoate beside,
A Kirtle laid with silver Lace,
with gallant golden stitches.
In doing so, good Sir, (quoth she)
you well may wrong your Britches.
We Will walk about the Meddowes green,
each Summer morning early.
Forbear (quoth she) it is better far,
amongst green Pease and Barley.
Where if you will a peazing go,
you must take up no Fitches:
Lest those that owe the Pescod field,
do say you wrong your Britches.


I Will give thee all my ewes and Lambs,
and Kine unto thy Dary.
To keep the horns your self (quoth she)
I hope you will be wary.
For they will serve you passing fit,
to be your hous-hold riches,
Where if you go to borrow horns,
you will greatly wrong your Britches.
The Minstrell of our town shall play
thee still thy mornings Dittie.
Good Sir (quoth she) I want rewards,
for one that is so witty.
For when I hear your music sound,
my fingers always itches,
To crown you with a Fiddlers fee:
you wrong (good Sir) your Britches.
We Will feed no more on Barley broth,
the Grape's a sweeter diet.
Too deep a taste (quoth she) will bring,
your body out of quiet,
And vex you with tormenting gripes,
of many rumbling stitches:
That you will be constrained (good Sir)
at last to wrong your Britches.
The Second part.
To the same tune.


I Will fight, my Love, in thy defense,
my weapons at thy pleasure,
Whereat the wily Wench repli'de,
I doubt you will have no leisure.
And so you will a dastard prove,
When as the field he pitches:
And ^oming thence for fear away,
you much may wrong your Britches.
I am a lively Iouiall Lad,
and for thy sake will swagger:
Until the ground look blue (my Wench)
my wit shall never stagger.
Take heed (quoth she) lest Midas Ass
your drowsy pate bewitches:
For being drunk, then with your Punke,
good Sir, you will wrong your Britches.
A Pot and Pipe is all my life,
for this becomes a wooer:
Come, bonny Besse, let us coll and kiss,
I am no other dooer.
Hold off (quoth she) your hands are foul,
and all my clothes bepitches;
For if you thus bemoyle your self,
you will greatly wrong your Britches.


My dapple gray to bear thee hence,
shall soon be saddled finely:
To ride and run for thee, my Love,
so thou will use me kindly.
But if you ride too fast (quoth she)
he will throw us into ditches:
And so shall I bemyer my self,
and you much wrong your Britches.
The Yongman at these wilely words,
in friendly manner smiled:
In that she had so cunningly,
his proffered love beguiled.
But yet at last she took of him,
himself and all his riches:
And would no more then scoffing say,
(Good Sir) you wrong your Britches.
Thus Cupid is a wilely Lad,
and well his Bow can handle:
To make young Wenches light their lamps,
to burn by Venus Candle.
For I am now in love (quoth she)
this young man me bewitches:
And I am vexed that ere I said,
(Good Sir) you wrong your Britches.
FINIS.
