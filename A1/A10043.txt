A Lamentation from Rome, how the Pope does bewail,
That the Rebels in England can not prevail,

To the tune of Row well ye Mariners.


ALl you that news would here,
Give ear to me poor Fabyn Fly,
At Rome I was this year,
And in the Pope his nose did lie,
But there I could not long abide,
He blew me out of every side:
For furst when he had hard the news,
That Rebels did their Prince misuse,
Then he with joy,
Did sport him self with many a toye,
he then so stout,
From that his nose he blew me out.
But as he was a sleep,
Into the same again I goot:
I crept there in so deep,
That I had almost burnt my coote,
New news to him was brought that night.
The Rebels they wear put to flight,
But Lord how then the Pope took one,
And called for a Mary bone,
up howgh make have:
My lovers all be like to waste,
tyse Cardnall, up priest,
Saint Peter he does what he lest.
So then they fell to Mess,
The Friars one their Beads did pray,
The Pope began to bless,
At last he weist not what to say.
It chanced so the next day morn,
A Post came blowing of his Horn,
Saying Northomberland is take,
But then the Pope began to quake.
he then rubd nose,
With Pilgrome salve be noynt his hose,
run here, run there,
His nails for anger began to pare.
Not Northomberland alone,
But many of his wicked aid:
Such as thought not to groan,
They hoped well for to aplayd,
There parts to have there hearts desire,
But now is quenched there flames of fire,
The greatest and the mean beside,
With other youths fast bound must ride,
Ketch fast, keep well,
There youthful blood they long to sell,
trust this dear Pope,
what is it than wherefore ye hope.
When he perceived well,
The news was true to him was brought,
Upon his knees he fell,
And then S. Peter he be sought,
That he would stand his friend in this,
To help to aid those servants his,
And he would do as much for him,
But Peter sent him to Saint Simme.
So then he snuft,
the Friars all about he cuft,
He roard he cryde,
the priests they durst not once abide.
The Cardnalles they begins,
To stay and take him in there arm,
He spurnd them on the shinnes,
Away the trudgd for fear of harm.
So there the pope was left alone,
Good Lord how he did make his moan,
The Stools against the Walls he threw,
And me out of his nose he blewe.
I hopt I skipt,
From place to place about I whipped,
he swore he tare,
Till from his Crown he pold the hear.
He courst me so about,
In the house I conld find no rome,
Loath I was to go out,
And shrind my self under a Brom.
Then by and by down he was set,
with anger he was one a swet,
He rubd his elbowe on the Wall,
So fell a railing on Saint Paul.
Fie fie blood heart,
He scratchde him self till he did smart*
poll nose rube eye,
Grash the teth draw mouth awrye.
He wept and wrong his hands,
yea worse and worse began to fret:
Thus radging still he stands,
then out at door I did me get,
I was not sooner gone from thence,
But worse and worse was his pretense,
The post he plucked from the house,
he left no harbor for a Mouse,
thus now the popes mad.
Because no better luck they had,
forlorn molest,
that they so ill their meat digest.
When I had vewed all,
To bring this news my wings I spread,
to this parplict he is fall.
I wish some would go hold his head.
For certainly he does ill fare,
yet for the same I do not care,
For God his power will convince,
And aid with right his beloved prince.
then Pope radge thou,
The God in heaven has made a vow,
to keep all his,
That God is just our stay he is.
