THe immortal gloir, that procedis be the rycht line of virtue, fra our

abundantly dilatit athort al cuntreis, throucht the quhilk, the precius germe

quhilk is ane immortal ande supernatural medicyne, to cure and to gar

our grace is ane rycht nobil, baytht of virtue ande of genoligie. al their
thingis before rehersit, i beand summond be institutione of ane good eil, hes
taken ane ^emerare consait, to present to our nobil grace, an^ tracteit of the
first laubir of my pen bot it i vas lang stupefact ande timide, for falt of ane
pere^ptoir co^clusione, i nocht heffand ane perfyte determinatione, of quhat
purpos or matter that var may necessair ande honest to be dilatit: than
dredour ande schame beand repulsit fra my melancolius cogitations, i began to
reuolue the librarye of my vndirstanding, ande i socht all the secreit corneris
of my gazophile, ymaginant vitht in the cabinet of my interior thochtis, that
there var na matter mair convenient ande necessair, for this present dolorus time
nor to rehearse the cause an^e occasion of the onmersiful afflictio^e of the
desolat realm of scotland the quhilk desolatione hes occurrit be the
mischance, of fureous mars, that hes violently ocupeit the domicillis of
tranquil pace that sueit gods of human felicite. the quhilk tracteit i hef
dediet ande direckyt to our nobil grace, in hope that our grace vil resaue it
as humainly, as it var ane rich present of grit conseque^s. it vas the custum
of perse, that none of the subiectis durst cum in the presens of there king, bot
gyf tha brocht su^ gift or present, to be delyurit til him, efferad for there
qualite. the historigraphours rehersis of ane pure man of perse, quha be chance
recountrit king darius. this pure man throucht grit pouerte, head no thing to
present till his king, eff^ir the custum of perse, quhar for he ran til ane
reueire that ran neir b^, and brocht the palmis of his handis full of that
fresche vat^ir to the king for ane present. that nobil king, persauand the good
vil ande hartly obediens of this pure man, he resauit that litil quantite of
cleen vattir as humainly, as it head been ane rich present of gold, ande he
gart delyuir to the said pure man sex thousand pieces of gold. and ane goldin
vattir lauar. Exiguu^ munus cu^ dat tibi pauper amicus.
fra this exe^pil cummis ane vlgare adagia, quhilk sais that quhen ane pure man
makkis ane sacrefeis, and throucht his pouerte he vantis ensens to make the
seremons of his sacrefeis that sacrefeis sal be acceptabil before the goddis,
Accipit^ placide and plene laudare mem^nto. Chato.
be cause that he dois sa mekil, as his pissance may distribute. it is vrytin
in Sanct marc, quhou our sa^uiour estemeit ande comme^dit, the oblatione of
tua half penners, that vas offrit in the tempil be ane pure vedou that head na
mair money. nor he estemeit the grite offrandis that vas offrit be rich
opulent men. Nou for conclusione (illustir princes) my esperance is sa grite,
Cu^ venisset autem vnavidua pauper: mi sit duo mu nita quod est quadraus.
that i belief that our grace vil resaue this tracteit as humainly, as king
darius resauit the clean vattir fra the pure man of perse. this tracteit is na
bettir nor as mekil vattir, bot it my good vil and hartly intention ande my
detful obediens, excedis the hartly intention of the pure man that offrit the
fair vattir to king darius, pray and to god to preserve our grace in perpetual
felicite. Marci. 13.


PROLOG TO THE REDAR.
Indegetet var goddis of egypt quhilkis head bee^e verteouse princes quhe^ thai
lyuit.
AMasis the sycond, quhilk vas the last king ande indegete of the egiptie^s,
(ande as diodore rehersis, he vas the fyift legislator of egypt) maid ane
ordinance, contrar the vice of ydilnes, that al his subiectis of egypt, var
oblist under the pane of deed, to bring every eir, there namis in vrit, to the
prouest of the province quhar they remanyng vas: ande there to testife the stait
other vacatione, ande the maneir of there living. be this politic ordinance, the
egiptiens ^ar inducit till adhere to virtue, ande to leyrne (...) ande mecanyke
occupatio^s may comodius ande convenient for the public veil of egypt. Tha^
efftir this ordinance of amasis the Gymniosophistes institut ane mair strict
ordinance amang the pepil of inde: Gymniosophistes var philosophours of inde,
quhilkis var aynakyt, vitht out any sort of cletyng there doctrine aperit to be
rather civil launor philosophi^.
that is to say, that ane person should nocht be admittit to resaue his corporal
refectione, quhil on to the time, that he head manifest realye, or ellis be
certan testificatione the frutis of his laubours, of the day precedent. the
seuerite of their strict ordinance, var augmentit, be ane edict of sesostris the
grit king of egypt for he statut ane ordinance til excerse his propir childir
ande the ong princis ande ge^til men of his court, to yse them til endure
excess of laubirs: he statut that none of them should tak there refectione, quhil
thai head gone ande run, the time of fife or sex houris: to that effect, that
throucht sic excerse, there membris mycht be purgit fra corruppit humors, the
quhilkis humors nocht beand degeistit, mycht be occasion to dull there spreit,
ande to make there body on a bil to resist ydiln^s* their ordinances of the
egiptiens, ar verray necessair to be vsit in all realmys: be rason that the
may part of the pepil, throucht there natural fraigilite, consumis the may
part of there dais in ydilnes. This detestatione that i have rehersit of
ydilnes, par chance may be ^ugit be inuyful ignorantis, that i condampe my
self, in sa far as thai persaue me nocht ocupeit vitht mecanyc byssynes, non to
confound ignorant detrakkers i will arm me vitht the vordis of publius scipio
as cicero rehersis in the prologe of the third beuk of his officis. sayand that
scipio vas neuyr les ydil as quhe^ he aperit to be idil nor he vas neiuyr les
solitair as quhe^ he aperit to be solitair. for quhe^ he aperit to be ydil tha^
he vas solist i^ his mind anent the gouuernyng of the pub^ic veil ande quhen
he aperit to be solitar, than he vas speikand vitht him self anent his auen
byssynes and sa he vas neuir ydil nor solitair quhou beit that he aperit sum
time in the sycht of the vulgaris to be ydil and solitair nun qua^ se minus
ociosum quam cum ociosus, nec minus solum, quam cum solus esset. i will apply
their vordis to my self. for quhou beit that the laubir vitht the pen and the
study on speculatio^e of virtue apei^ to be yd^lnes, it thai ar no ydilnes bot
rather ane solist byssynes of the body and of the spreit. ande nou sen good he^
nocht dotit me vitht speculatione of liberal scie^s nor philosophe, nor vitht
stryntht of my body til endure servile subiectio^e, nor it vitht no art nor
mecanyc craft, there for i will help (...) the auansuig of the public veil vitht
my study and vitht my pen In the antiant dais, the romans var mair renforsit
in curageus entreprisis be the virtue of the pen, ande be the persuasions of
orators, nor thai var renforsit be the sourdis of men of veyr. Every craft is
necessair for the public veil, ande he that hes the gift of traductione
compiling or teching, his faculte is as honest as crafty ande as necessair: as
is to be ane marynel, ane merchant, ane co^dinar, charpenteir, captan, ciuilist
or any vthir crafft or scie^s. there is na degreis of virtue ama^g the^, for gyf
ane craft or sciens be good, tha^ it is as good, as any craft can be, for all
sortis of verteous, facultes ar of ane lyik virtue, as cicero sais i^ the third
of his paradoxis, that ane good man can be na bettir nor ane vthir man that is
good, for gyf ane man be good than he is as good, as any good man can be
siclyik gyf ane craft be good, than it is as good. as any craft can be there for
ane man of ane craft, should nocht detest ane vthir sort of craft, considerand
that our hurt nature hes nocht dotit ane man til use al craftis. Aristotil
sais in the first beuk of his politiques, that nature hes nocht maid ane man
lyik gladius delphicus The significatione of gladius delphicus is of this sort.
Nihil eni^ natura facit tale: quale statuarij delphicu^ gladiu^ obindiciam sed
vnum ad vnum.
delphos is ane solemnit place, on the hyl of pernasus, quhar there standis ane
tempil dedicat til appollo, there came daly to that tempil, diverse pure men in
pilgremage, there duelt on that hill, smythis, and forgearis of yrn ande steil,
the quhilkis culd make ane instrament of yrn, convenient for money officis for
tha vald gar ane instrament serve for ane hammyr, ane turks, ane file, ane
sourd, ane knyf ande ane borrel* this sort of instramentis var sellit to pure
pilgryms that head nocht mekil money, Polit. 1.
to by ilk instrament be the self: ande be cause that instrame^^ seruit til
money officis, there for it vas callit gladius delphicus, of this sort aristotil
makkis ane co^parisone sayand that nature hes nocht maid ane man abil for
every craft or office, bot nature hes maid ane man abil to be ane prince, ane
abil to be ane seruand ane abil to be ane clerk, ane abil to be ane craftis
man, be rason that our hurt nature hes diuidit our co^plexions to be of
diverse qualiteis, ande for that cause ve sal find amang ane thousand men,
Mill hominu^ species and rerum discolor vsus vel le suu^ cuique est nec voto
viuitur vno perseus. Quot homines tot sententie. Ci^de fin^
ane thousand consaitis ande ane thousand conditions. for that cause aristotil
hes said in his politiques that in ilk comunite there is ane multitude, ande ilk
ane hes sum part of virtue of diverse degreis, ande ilk ane of their degreis ar
ordand til help vthirs in necessite, Cicero gyuis ane exempil in his retoric,
quhou that the citinaris of cartomat in ytalye, send for ane excellent
payntur, callit eracleon, thai promest to gyf him ane grit some of money, for
to paynt ane fair image of the deesse juno. than eracleon gart all the fair ande
best lyik ong vemen of that cite cum in his presens ande tha^ he chesit fife of
the best lyik amang them al, to be his patron, quhen he head contemplit and
spyit the proportions and propreteis of nature of their fife ladeis he chesit
the face of ane, the even of ane vthir the handis of the third the hayr of the
feyrd, the armis the myddil ande the feit of the fyift, of this sort he formit
the patron of the image of juno, efftir the proportione of diverse of the
me^bris of their foirsaid fife ong ladeis: be cause he culd nocht get al his
patron in ane special lady. for sche that vas pleysand of her face, vas nocht
pleysand of her hayr, ande sche that head plesand handis head nocht pleysand even,
No^ in oe^s omnia conueniunt. Cic. pro roscio amerimo.
ande sche that head ane veil proportionet body head evil proportionet feit ande
to conclude he culd nocht get ane lady in special that vas sufficient to be his
patron, nor it that culd be comparit til gladius delphicus quhilk vas ane
instrament that seruit til money officis. be this exempil ve may co^sidir that
nature hes nocht dotit ane person to be qualifeit to excerse al sortis of
craftis, for that cause aristotil, sais that al sortis of craftis should co^cur
to gyddir, ande ilkane til help vthirs, as nature prouidit first in the
beginning. their prolixt vordis before rehersit, ar ane preparatiue, ^o^trar the

Ande quhou beit, that there var na detrakkers, till accuse or to repreif my

Annibal that vaileant cartagien, beard venquest be nobil scipion, past for
refuge, till anthiocus king of sirrie, quha vas at that time, ane vaileant
prince, This storye is i^ the apothigmes of plutarc.
he refauit annibal in his realm, ande in his protectione, ande did him grit
honor ande reuerens, ane prince can nocht schau him mair nobil, nor mair
verteouse, as quhen he resauis in his fauoir, ane desolat prince distitute of
remeide, ande disparit of consolatione: quhilk hes been violently affligit be
adverse fortoune. their tua princis vsit often to visye the feildis to tak there
recreatione, ande to pas til hounting, ande til vthir gammis, convenient for
there nobilite. at sum time thai vald pas to the sculis, to heir the lecture of
ane philosophour callit phormion quha remanit in the town of ephisye, ande
techit natural ande moral philosophy to the o^g men of the cuntre. on ane day
their tua princis be chance, entrit in the achademya to heir ane lesson of
philosophy techit be the said phormion philosophour. he persauand their tua
princis entir in his scule, he changit the matter of that present lecture, ande
but prouisio^e, he began to teache the ordour of the veyris, declarand quhou
that captans should ordour battellis contrar there enemeis. this philosophour
techit sa profundly the maneir of the ordoryng of battellis in presens of their
tua princis, that thai that herd him neuyr of before, meruellit nocht alanerly
of his quyk ingyne: bot as veil thai that hard him daly var in grit
admiratione* it is the nature of ane man that hes ane quyk spreit, ande ane
ripe ingyne, that every purpos ande questione is familiar till him. king
anthiocus tuke grit gloir, be cause he head sic ane prudent philosophour in his
cuntre: quhar for he inquirit annibal, quhat judgment he head of his
philosophour phormion. Annibal ansuert vitht as hardy curage, as quhen he
venqueist the romans at the battle of cannes: for ane vaileant prince, tynis
nocht his curage, quhou beit that adverse fortune resist his felicite: bot
rather hes good hope that dame fortonne vil mittigat hyrauen crualte. this vas
then ansuer of annibal till anthiocus in the presens of phormio^. Nobil prince
anthiocus, i hef seen money ald men tyne there vyt, bot i sau neuyr sa grite ane

mirror of folly, there ca^ nocht be ane mai^ folly, as quhen ane ydiot

can thole, or quhat to^g ean be still. quhe^ thai see, or heris tell, of the
presumpteous comsait of thy vane philosophour, quhilk he^ been neurest al his
dais in ane solitar achade mya of greice, ande it he dar be sa bold to present
him before prince annibal, to disput ande till indoctryne the the maneir of the
^eyris ande of the batellis, as he var prince of africa or captan of rome. for
verite he hes ane small judgment of sic matters, or ellis he estemeis us to be
litil experementit in the veyris. be his vane consaitis that he hes studeit on
beukis, he beleuis to leyrne annibal, the prettik of the veyris ande the
conquessingis of realmis o king anthiocus, all the goddis vait, quhat defferens
is betuix philosophy techit in sculis, ande betuix the stait of captans in the

iunyng of ane battle, vitht cruel escharmouschis in the ryding of forrais. he
sau neuyr the array of men of veyr brokyn, ande tua armeis myxt amang vthirs,

retere fra ane dangeir, he persauit neuyr the trason of ane party, nor the
couuardeis of ane vthir party. he sau neuyr the litil nummir of them that
fechtis, nor the grite nummir of them that fleis for dreddour. O anthiocus, thy
philosophour should teache the thing that he hes studeit at the sculis and the
thing that he he is seen vitht his even: to them that vas neuyr at the sculis,
ande to the^ tha^ vas neuyr pretykkit in the veyris: rather not til us that hes
been experimentit in the veyris al our dais. the prettik of the veyris is mair

Thou vait king anthiocus, that this sex ande thretty eiris ^ hef been excersit

visdome: bot the end of the veyris consistis in the chance of fortune. There
for it is grit folly to thy philosophour, til vndirtak to leyrn the ordiring of

quhen thai pleyse him nocht ande he makkis small pottis of the brokyn verk of

certane, quhou beit that prosperus men, prouidis nocht to resist the occasions
of the mutabiliteis: quhilk occasions ar ay vigilant, to suppedit and to spule,
al them that are ingrate, of the benefecis o^ good. the mutations of monarchis
ande dominions, ar manifest in the holy scriptur, ande in the verkis of the
may famous ancia^t historigraphours. quhar is the grite ande rich tryumphand
cite of nynyue, quhilk head three dais iournais of circuit? at this time there is
nocht ane stane, sta^dant on ane vthir. Quhar is the grite tour of babilone?
the quhilk vas biggit b^ ane may ingenius artifeis, of proportione, quantite,
ande of stryntht, it aperit to be perdurabil, ande inuyncibil. bot nou it is
desolat, ande inhabit be serpens, ande vthir venemuse beystis Quhat sal be said
of the ^^che tryumphant town of troy, ande of castle y^ione, quhilk head all the portis of euoir bane, ande the pillaris of fine siluyr: bot at this time,
ane fut of hicht of the vallis can nocht be seen, for all the grond o^ the palce

sone of agenoir, the quhilk vas a^ that time, the may pepulus town abufe the

no thing quhar i^ stude bot barrane feildis. Siklyik lacedemonya, quhar the
legislator ligurgus gef to the pepil strait famous lauis, of the quhilk, ane
gri^ part ar vsit presently, in the universal varld, is ^ocht that nobil town
extinct furtht of rememorance? Quhat sal be said of athenes, the vmquhile

rich monarche of rome, quhilk dantit ande subdeuit all the varld? is nocht nou
the superiorite of it, partit ande diuidit i^ money ande diverse par^is,
conformand to the vordis of lucan, quha said that the vecht of rome, should gar
it ryue in money partis: the vecht of it signifeit nocht, the vecht of hauy
vallis, housis, stonis, ande vthir materialis: bot rather it signifeit, the
vecht of the inexorbitant extorsions, that it committit on the universal varld.
quhilk is the cause tha^ the monarche of it, is diuidit amang money diverse
princis. of this sort euere thing hes ane time, for mutations of varldly
felicite is ane natural habitude, quhilkis is the cause, that nathyng remanis
lang constant in ane prosperus stait: ande that is the special cause, that al
dominions ^^^ri^ dochaei^ ande cummis, to subuersione. The first monarche of
the varld vas translatit fra the assiriens to them of perse, ande fra perse to
the greikis, and traslatit fra the greikis to the romans, fra ^he romans to the
franche men, ande fra the franche men to the germanis. ande quhou be it that
the pepil knauis their mutations to be of verite, it there is nocht money that
knauis, the cause of their mutations, Quis eni^ cogitabit sensum d^mini aut quis
consiliarius e^^
be rason that the judgment of good (quhilk virkis al thing) is ane profou^d
onknauen deipnes, the quhilk passis human ingyne, to comprehend the ground
or limitis of it: be cause our vit is over febil, our ingyne over hard, our
thochtis over vollage, ande our eiris over schort. There is money ignorant
pepil, Sapien. 9.
that imputis the subuer sio^s ande mutations of prosperity, to proceid of
fortoune: Intelle^i quem omniu^ operu^ dei nulla^ possit homo inuenire ratione^
corumque fiunt sub sole.
sic consaitis procedis of the gentilite ande pagans doctrine ande nocht of
goddis lau nor it of moral philosophy: quhou be it that niuenal hes said, that
fortoune is the cause, that ane small man ascendi^ to digni^eis ande that ane
grite man fallis in ruuyne. Sic opinions should nocht be haldin nor beleuit for
there is no thing in this varld, that cummis on mankind, as prosperity or
aduersite, bot al procedis fra the dyuyne pouer, as is vrityne in the.xi.
cheptour of ecclesiasticus, bona and mala vita and mors, Ecce. ^
paupertas and honestas, adeo sunt. There for it may be said, that al thai that
imputis aduersite or prosperity, Si fortuna volet, fiet de rethore co^sul: si
vol^^ hec eade^, fies de consule rethor iuuenal.
to proceid of fortune. thai may be put in the nu^ tayr of them that Sanct
paul prophetiit in the sycond epistil to tymothie, erit enim tempus, cum fanam

O quhat familiar promese is this that god hes prormeist till al them that vil

his justice sal extinct our generatione furtht of rememora^ce, ande that he

quhilk sal be occasion, that sieve of us sal chaise ane hundretht of our ald
enemeis, ande ane hu^dretht of us sal chaisse ten thousand of them furtht of
our cuntre as is rehersit in the foir said xxvi cheptour of leuitic. for quhon
be it that god hes permittit the inglis men to scurge us, as he permittit
satan to scurge the holy man Job, Job. ca. 2.
it follouis nocht that god vil tyne us perpetualye, nor it it follouis nocht,
that the cruel inglis men, quhilk is ar boreaus ande hang men permittit be god
to puneis us, that thai ar in the fauoir of god, for the exsecutione of goddis
punitione on us, as i sal explane be ane exempil of comparisone. ane boreau or
hang man is permittit be ane price to scurge ande to puneise tra^sgressours,
ande there efftir that samyn boreau, is stikkit or hangit eftiruar^ for his
cruel demeritis, as is the end of them that settis there felicite to skattir and
to skail blude. Siklyike the cruel inglis men that hes scurgit us, hes nocht
dune it of manhede or visdome nor of ane good oil: bot rather the supreme
plasmator of hauyn ande eird hes permittit them to be boreaus, to puneis us,
for the mysknaulage of his magestie. Quhar for i treist, that his divine
justice vil permi^ sum vthir straynge natio^e to be mercyles boreaus to them,
ande til extinct that false seid ande that incredule generatione furtht of
rememorance, be cause thai ar, ande alse h^s been, the special motione of the
iniust veyris that hes trublit cristianite, thus sex hundretht eir by past.
quha list^^ to reide the prophesye of ysaye tha sal find ane exempil co^fo^mand
to this samyn purpos, quhou that the realm of the assiriens vas the scurge of
good to puneise the pepil of israel for there disobediens. bot fra time that the
pepil of israel vas reterit fra there vice, good distroyit there scurge, that is
to say, he distroyt assure the king of the assirriens, ande transporti^ his
realm, in the subiectione of the king of perse ande meid. Sikliyk the grite
town of babillon vas permittit be good to scurge the pepil of israel: ande
there efftir quhen the israelieteis var reterit fra there inniquite good delyurit
them fra the captivity of babillon ande distroyit that grite town, ande maid
it ane desert inhabitabil for serpens ande vthir venesu^ beystis. Euyrie thing
is corruppit be ane vthir corruppit complexione, ane file is ane instrumento to
file down yrn, ande ane synnar is maid ane instrument of the divine justice,
to puneise ane vthir synnar, the file that filit the yrne is vorne ande cassin
auaye as ane thing ^nutil to serve to do any good verk: bot the yrn that hes
been filit be the forgear or be ane smyth^, is kepit to serve to the necess^te
of men, the father takkis the vand or the scurge, to puneise his son, that
hes brokyn his command, ande quhen his son becummis obedient, the father
brakkis the vand ande castis it in the fyir: bot it gyf his son rebellis
contrar the correctione of the vand, than the father takkis ane batton or su^
vthir ^^^rk vappin to puneise his son, and forettis fatherly discipline, ande
vsis rigorus extreme punitione. ane ox that repungnis the brod of his hird, he
gettis doubil broddis, (...) he that misprisis the correctione of his
preceptor, his correctione is changit in rigorus punitione.

Of diverse opinions that the pagan philosophours held of the conditions ande
enduring of the varld, ande quhou the actor d^claris that the varld is neir ane
end. Chap. V.
THe special cause of the scurge that hes affligit us, hes procedit of our
disobediens co^tra^ the command of god. Ande the cause of our disobediens hes
procedit of ane varldly affectione ande cupidite that ve have touart the vile
corruptio^e of this varld that the scriptour calli^ mammon, Facite vobis amicos
do ma^mo^a iniquitatis.
quhilk ve hald for ane souerane felicite, bot nochtheles it is bot ane
corrupit poison in sa far as vecan nocht serve good ande it to gyddir. L^ce. 16
as Sanct mathou hes said, e may nocht serve god ande ma^mon. there is ane
vthir cause that makkis us disobedient, Non potestis d^o se^ire and ma^mo^^.
money of us beleuis in our consait that there is na thing perdurabil bot the
varld alanerly. sic abusione procedis of onfaythtfulnes, ande of our blind
affectione, quhilk makkis us sa brutal, that ve vait nocht quhat thing the
varld is, Mat. 6. ca
nor quhou lang it sal endure, bot rather ve believe that it sal be perpetual.
there for our cupidite constreneis us to desire prolongatione of our dais:
that ve may use the blind sensual felicite of it, quhilk money of us thynkis
mair comodius ande necessair for our veilfayr, nor ve thynk of the sempeternal
olimp. Bot vald ve considir the diffinitione of the varld, than i believe that
our solistnes ande vane opinione vald al^ir in ane faythtful consait. There is
money that speikis of the varld, and it thai vait nocht quhat thing is the
varld. the pagan philosophours held money vane opinions and tynt mekil time i^
vane questions and speculations, ande hes tormentir the spreitis, drauand and
co^pil and money beukis, quhilk is ar set furtht in diverse cuntreis, bot it
there vas neuyr ane final accordance co^cludit ama^d ehem, for of the final
verite that thai socht, thai gat litil, ande the ignorance that thai have put
in vrit, is verray mekil, be rason that the smallest part of there ignorance in
supernatural ^acis, excedit the may part of there knaulage. Plato, aristotel,
pithagoras, empedocles, epecurius, thales, and money vthir of the pagan
philosophours, hes head grite defferens ande contentione to paynt ande discriue
the origyne ande propriete of the varld Pithagoras said that the varld is ane
thing, and it that ve call universal is ane vthir thing. the philosophour thales
said that there is bot ane varld. the astrologien metrodore affermit, that there
is money and infinite varldlis. selencus the philosophour said that the vardlis
eternal. Plato said that the varld head ane beginning, ande sal have ane end,
epicurius said that the varld is ronde lyik ane boule, and empedocles said that
the varld is lang and ronde lyik ane eg. Socrates techit in his achademya,
sayand, that eftir seuyn ande thretty thousand eiris, al thingis, sal return,
to that sammyn stait, as thai began, ande he to be borne agane in his mother

thingis that are by past sal return agane to there first stait. My purpos is
nocht to speik of this material varld that i^ maid of the four elementis, of
the eird, the vattir the air ande the fyir: bot rather i will speik of the varld
that garris us mysknau good, ande disobedient till his command, quhe^ the
creator of al thingis, came in this varld, to redeem us, fra the ^ternal
captivity of satan, he complenit ande repre^it the varld, bot it he repreuit
nocht the eird, the vattir, the air nor the fyir, for thai four elementis brac
nocht his command, i have herd diverse pepil regret, maling, ande make
exclamations contrar the varld, sayand, o false varld, o miserabil. varld, o
dissaitful varld, o inconsta^t varld, o malicius varld, ande it thai kneu
nocht, quhat thing is the varld. eftir my purpos, that vard that the pepil
malingnis, is nocht ane substancial material mas maid of eird, Nunc iudiciu^
est mu^di: nu^c pri^ceps huius mundi.
vattir, air and fyir, bot rather it is the evil life of the pepil that
conuersis viciuslye, ande the prince of this last varld, is the devil, the
quhilk sal be cassin furtht as is rehersit in the euangel of Sanct ihone: this
varld is noch^ formit of the fouer elementis as of eird vattir air ande fyir as
good creat the material varld in the beginning, Ioha^. 12.
bot rather it is crea^ of seuyn elementis of satan's creatione, tha^ is to
say, auereise, ambitione, luxure, crualte, dissait, on faythtfulnes,
dissimulatione, and insaciabil cupidite. allace al their seuyn e^ementis that
this last varld is creat of, at over abundand, vithtin our affligit realm,
quhilk is the cause of the calamite that it induris. bot var ve as solist to
considir the vanite of this last varld as Solomon considrit it, than doutles ve
vald be verray solist to resist the invasions of it, Cu^qu^ me conuertisse^ ad
vniuersa opera qua fecere^t manus me vidi in omnibus vanitate^ and
afflictione^ adimi.
quhilk prouokis us to vice, or var ve as solist til impung the occasion of
syn, as ve ar solist to seik remeid contrar the exterior accidentis that often
occurris til hurt our body, than doutles our sensual cupidite vald be cum
mortefeit ande venqueist. Often tymys ve seik remeide to keip us fra evil
accidentis that hurtis our body, as quhen the sune castis our grite heyt: ve
pas under the vmbre or the schaddou. quhen ve ar tirit to ga^g on our feit, ve

ve pas under the thak, or vthir couuert place. quhen ve ar thrsty ve se^k

duelling place under ane temperat climat. Bot in opposite, quhen auereise
assaileis us, ve seik nocht the virtue of liberalite, nor quhen vile luxure
trublis us, ve adhere nocht to the virtue of temperance ande contenens. quhen
ire affligis us, ve seik nocht the virtue of patiens quhen arrogans ande
ambitione entris in our hartis, ve seik nocht the virtue of humilite. ande nou
be cause that ve seik na remeid contra^ our disordinat cupidite, nor it
resistis the occasions ande temptations of the prouocatio^s of vice, ve becum
haistylye venqueist, be rason that our small resista^ce, generis grit hardynes
in the adverse party of our saul. there is ane mair odius thing amang us, for all the vicis that our cupidite prouokis us to conmit, our blind affectio^e
garris us believe, that tha ar supreme virtue ande felicite be cause thai ar
pleisand till our fragil nature, the quhilk is the principal occasion that ve
converse sa viciusle as this miserabil se^sual lyif var perpetual, ande as the
deed head na pouuer to sla our bodeis, Ia^ vi^unt hoi^es tanqua^ more nulla
sequatur and velud infernus fabula ficta foret.
and as there var nocht ane hell to torment our saulis, bot as there var ane
fenet hell of the poietis fictions; as virgil hes set furtht in the sext beuk of
his eneados. Bot as i hef before rehersit, i suspect that there is over money
that beleuis in the opinione of Socrates, that is to say that the varld sal
endure seuyn ande thtetty thousand eiris. bot admittand under potestatione,
that Socrates opinione var of verite, it socrates hes nocht said that the term
of our live dais sal pas the course of nature, that is to say, to pas the
course of ane hundretht eir, ve have experiens daly, that quhar ane man lyuis
ane hundretht eir in any cuntre ane hundretht lyuis nocht ane hundretht
monetht. Nou to confound the opinione of Socrates, ande to confound al them
that vil nocht believe that the varld is neir ane final end, i will arm me
vitht the croniklis of master ihone carrion, quhar he allegis the prophesye of
hel^e. say and that fra the beginning of the varld, on to the consummatione of
it, sal be the space of sex thousand eir. the quhilk sex thousand eir sal be
deuydit in three partis. the first tua thousand eir, the varld sal be vitht out
any specefeit lau i^ vr^^* quhilk vas the time betuix adam ande abraham. the
nyxt tua thousand eir vas the lau of ^irconcisione, vitht ane institutione of
divine policy, ande vitht adoratione of god, quh^lk vas the time betuix
Abraham ande the in^arnatione quhen crist ihu^s resauit our humanite for our
redemptione. the third tua thousand eir sal be betuix the incarnatione and the
last aduent quhilk sal be the co^summatione of the varld. bot thi^ last tua
thousand eir, (as master ihone carrion allegis in the prophesye of helie) sal
nocht be completit, be rason that the day of judgment sal be antecipet, be
cause of them that are his electis, as is vrityn in the xxiiii cheptour of Sanct
mathou, and nisi breuiati fuissent dies illi, non fieret salua omnis caro: sed
propter electos breuiabu^tur dies illi. quha listis to reide all the xxiiii
cheptour of Sanct mathou, tha sal persaue euid^ntly that the varld is verray
neir ane end, be rason that money of the singis and taikkyns that precedis the
day of judgment that are expremit in the foirsaid cheptour, ar by past, and the
remanent ar nou presently in our dais: there for efftir the supputatione of
helie as mastir ihone carrion hes rehersit, the varld hes bot four hundretht
fyfty tua eir till endure be cause that there is five hundrethe forty aucht eir
by past of the foir said sex thousand eir. bot eftir the vordis of Sanct
mathou, the co^summatione of the varld sal be haistiar nor four hu^dretht
fyftye and tua eir. it god hes nocht affixt ane certan day to fall vitht i^ the
said term of iiii. c. lii eir, as is rehersit in Sanct mathou, de die au^t
illa and hora, nemo sit neque a^geli celoru^ nisi solus pater. there for ve have
mistir to be vigilant ande reddy, sen the term of cristis cumming is scho^t,
ande the day oncertane, as is said in the foir said euangel. vigilate ergo quia
nescitis qua hora dominus vester venturus sit. this veil considrit, may be ane
probabil raso^ that the varld is neir ane end. quhilk should be occasion til
have it in detestatione, ande til have premeditatione of the future eternal
beatitude and felicite, that good hes promeist til al them that haldis it in
abhominatione.

thai tua tablis hes been regester and fundatione til al them that hes studeit
in cosmographie geographie and in topographie. There for to make ane
diffinitione of cosmaghraphie (as far as ve scheiphirdis hes co^templit) it is
ane universal discriptione of the varld, contenand in it, the four elementis,
the eird, the vattir, the air, and the fyir the sone and mune and all the
sterius: there for ane man that desiris till hef any judgment of cosmaghraphie,
he should first contempil and considir the circlis of the spear celest. for be
that distinctione of the said circlis, it sal be facil to knau the distance of
diverse cuntreis that lyis under the said circlis baytht of there longitude and
of there latitude and the proportione of the climatis, and the diversity of the
dais and nychtis of the four quartars of the varld, and it sal declair the
mouyng eleuatione, and declinatione of the sone mune, and of the sternis fixed
and sternis erratic. and it sal declair the eleuatione of the polis, and the
lynis parallelis, and the meridian circlis, and diverse vthir documentis and
demonstrations mathematikis.

Nou first to speik of the mouyng of the spear and of the diuisione of the
hauynis, e sal knau that the varld is diuidit in tua partis that is to say. the
first part is the regione elementair quhilk is subject til alteratione and to
corruptione. the nyxt part of the varld is callit the regione celest (quhilk
philosophours callis quinta essentia) vitht in the concauite of the quhilk, is
closit the regione elementar this said regione celest is nothir variabil nor
corruptabil it is diuidit in ten speris, and the gritest spear quhilk is the
outuart spear inclosis in it, the spear that is nyxt til it and sa be
progressione and ordur euyrie spear inclosis the spear that is nerest till it.
in the first, the regione elementair is inclosit vitht in the spear of the mune
and nyxt it is the spear of mercurius, and syne the spear of venus, and nyxt it
is the spear of the sone, and abufe and about it is the spear of mars. and syne
the spear of Jupiter and than the spear of Saturnus. and ilk ane of their speris
hes bot ane stern or planete that mouis in the zodiac, contrar the muuyng of
the first mobil that ve call the te^t spear. nyxt their speris, is the firmament
quhilkis callit the hauyn or the spear of the sternis and about it is the nynte
spear callit the hauyn cristellyne, be cause that there can nocht be na sternis
seen in it. Al their nine speris or hauynis ar inclosit vitht in the tent spear
quhilki^ callit the first mobil the quhilk makkis reuolutione and course on the
tua polis fra day to day in the space of xxiiij houris fra orient til occident
and returnis agane to the orient. bot the mouyng of the tothir nine hauynis is
fra the occident to the orient, quhilk is contrar to the mouyng of the tent
spear callit the first mobil. it nochtheles the mouyng of the first mobil is of
sic violence that it co^streneis the tothir nine speris or hauynis to pas vitht
it fra orient till occident quhilk is contrar to there auen natural mouyng there
for the co^pulsit retrograid mouyng is callit be astronomours motus raptus
accessus, and resessus stellarum fixarum. all the thing that circuitius this
last tent hauyn or first mobil is immobil and mouis nocht, there for it is
callit the hauyn empire quhar the trone divine standis, as effermis the famous
doctors of the kyrk Nou to proceid in the discriptione of the speris of the
hauynis. in the first, e sal ymagyn ane line that passis throucht the spear
lyik til ane extree of ane cart callit axis spear, quhilkis the rycht dyametre
of the spear, on the quhilk line or extre the speris and hauynis turnis on.
tha^ at the endis of the said line e sal ymagyne tua sternis quhilk ar callit
the tua polis of the firmament ane of them standis at the northt quhilk is
callit the pole artic boreal or septe^trional, it aperis til us in our
habitatione be rason that it is eleuat abufe our orizone, the tothir stern
standis at the southt, and it is callit the pole antartic austral or meridional
it is ay hid fra us for it aperis neuyr in our hemispere be rason that it is
under our or^o^. e sal vndirstand that the stern quhilk the scheiphirdis and
marynalis callis the north stern, that stern is nocht the pole artic for the
pole artic is bot ane ymaginet point dista^t iiij degreis fra that stern that
ve call the northt stern the quhilk stern is callit alrukaba, and alse e sal
vndirstand that the soucht stern that is eleuat abufe the orizon of them that
duellis beond the equinoctial it is callit canapus there for it should nocht be
callit the pole antartic for the pole antartic is bot ane ymaginet point,
quhilk standis iiij degreis fra the stern that is callit canapus. There is ane
vthir circle callit orizone the quhilk cuttis the spear in tua parti^, there is
tua sortis of ori^on^ ^ne is callit the rycht orizon, the ^^thi^ is callit the
oblique orizone. thai that hes there zenith in the equinoctial thai hef the
rycht orizon be rason tha^ the tua polis ar in there orizon. ande thai that hes
ane oblique orizon, ane of the polis is eleuat abufe there orizon ande the
tothir pole is hid under there hemispeir and orion. There is ane vthir circle in
the spear callit meridian the quhilk gais betuix the tua polis rycht abufe our
head than quhen the sune cummis fra the orient to that circle it is just tuelf
houris of the day and quhe^ the sune is in opposite til our meridian under our
orizo^ tha^ it is mydnycht. There is ane vthir circle of the spear callit, the
circle equinoctial the quhilk deuidis the spear in tua partis it is of ane lyik
distance fra the tua polis, it is callit equinoctial, be cause that quhen the
sune cummis til it, than the day and the nycht ar of ane lyntht in enerye part
of the varld and that occurris tua tymis ilk eir that is to say, quhen the sune
cummis in the first degree of aries quhilk is the xj day of march, and in the
first degree of libra quhilk is the xiij day of september. There is ane vthir
grit circle in the spear callit the zodiac the quhilk deuidis the circle
equinoctial i^ tua partis the zodiac is deuidit i^ tuelf partis and ilk part is
callit ane sing the quhilk zodiac extendis til tuelf singnis callit Aries,
Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus,
Aquarius, Pisces. Ande euyrie sing is diuidit in xxx degreis. There is tua vthir
circlis in the spear callit colures ane of them passis be the zodiac in the
beginning of Aries and Libra quhilkis ar tua singnis equinoctialis the tothir
circle passis in the beginning of Cancer and capricor^ quhilk ar tua solstice
singnis. There is four vthir litil circlis in the spear ane is callit the tropic
of Cancer quhilk is the solstice of symmyr it is dista^t xxiij degreis xxx
munetis fra the equinoctial touart septemtrion, quhen the sune cu^is til it
than it is the langest day of the eir to them that duellis betuix the pole
artic and the equinoctial. The circle of capricorn is callit the solstice of
vyntir, quhen the sune cu^mis til it passand touart the pol antartic than thai
that duellis betuix the equinoctial and the pole antartic, hes there langast day
of the eir and tha^ ve hef the schortest day of the eir. The circle artic is
xxiij degreis xxx munitis fra the pole artic siclyik the circle antartic is
xxiij degreis xxx munitis fra the pole antartic and alse the septemtrional
solstice callit the tropic of ca^cer is xxiij degreis xxx munitis fra the
equinoctial and the meridional solstice of capricorn is xxiij degreis xxx

Siklyik ane man beand on the head of ane hill he vil see ane schip farrar on the

there is pepil that duellis under our feit. i should hef rehersit of be for quhou
that thai, that hes the equinoctial for there enych ande hes the tua polis in

equinoctial touart the meridian tropic of capricorn than thai that dueillis
under the northt pole thai hef ane conteneual nycht and no day quhil on to the
time that the sune return and is en^trit in the first degree of Aries the rason
of their lang nychtis is be cause that the sune beand past the equinoctial
touart the meridional tropic than it is all that time under the orion of them
that hes the northt pole for there enych. Siklyik quhen the sone cu^mis fra the
equinoctial pasland tonart the septen trional tropic of cancer than thai that
duellis under the meridional pole hes co^teneual nycht quhil the sone return

artic hes ane conteneual nycht half ane eir to gyddir and the to their half eir
thai hef co^teneual day and no nycht half ane eir to gyddir and it is of the
samyn sort to them that duellis under the pol antartic. And nou sen i hef
declarit the circlis of the spear i will speik of the reuolutions and of the
nature of the vij planetis. O e scheiphirdir, e sal contempil in the firmament
ane stern call^t saturn quhilk is hie abufe all the laif of the planetis and
for that cause it aperis verray litil to mennis sycht it makkis reuolutione in
thretty eir, and returnis to the samyn point that it came fra it makkis ane
circle fra occident til orient contrar the fy^st mobil it is of ane called frosty
nature. Nyxt saturn standis the spear and hauyn of Jupiter quhilk makkis the
course and circuit in tuelf eiris it is of ane temperat nature be cause it
standis in the myd vay betuix the caldnes of Saturn and the byrnand heyt that
Mars induris throucht the vicinite of sol. Ande nyxt to Jupiter standis the
hauyn and spear of Mars quhilk sum men callis Hercules it reuoluis in ane
circle in tua eiris it is inflammit in ane fervent heyt that ascendis fra the
sone. Mars
Nyxt to Mars standis the hauyn of the sone the quhilk makkis reuolutione in
three hu^dretht three scoir of degreis quhilk is the space of ane eir, Sol
the verteous heyt of it, tempera^is all the sternis of the firmament, Nyxt
under the spear of the soune sta^dis the spear and hauyn of Venus quhilk is ane
grit stern of ane marvelous lustir, Venus.
i^ the morning it aperis ane lang time or the soune ryise and gyffis ane grit
lycht at that time it is callit lucifer be cause it auancis the day before the
crepusculine. and siclyik it aperis verray haisty on fair day lycht quhen the
soune discendis under the vest ori^on, at that time it is cal^it vesper be
cause it prolongis the day, sum men callis it Juno and sum callis it isis. al
thing that the eird procreatis, is confortit be it be rason of the virtue of the
fresche deu that disce^dis fra it, it makkis ane on stabil revolution in three
hundretht xlviij dais and ay it is vitht in xlvj degreis fra the soune. Nyxt
under thespere of Venus, standis the spear and hauyn of Mercurius, Mercurius
quhilk sum men cellis appollo quhilk makkis reuolutione, nine dais mair
haistiar nor dois venus bot it aperis nocht sa grit as Venus, it is ay seen
before the soune rising and haisty eftir that the soune is cum to the vestorizon
and it is ay xxij degreis neir to the soune. The last and the nerest planet
quhilk is callit the mune the quhilk is ane familiar friend to the eird, Luna.
the creator of al thingis orda^d it to be ane remeid co^trar mirknes of the
nycht it is the may admirabil stern of the firmament, the diversity and the
varia^ce of it hes trublit the vndirsta^ding of the^ that co^te^plit it be
raso^ that su^ time it grouis and su^ it decressis time quhilk is contrar the
nature of vthir sternis for sum time it aperit neukyt heffand hornis and sum
time it vas al rond and sum time it vas bot half rond sum time it vald schau
lycbt half the nycht and sum time it vald schau lycht all the nycht and su^ time
it vald be three dais to gyddir nocht seen and alse the reuolutione and circuit
of it maid as la^g passage in xxvij dais and viij houris as the planet saturn
did i^ thretty eir. Nou i will rehers the cause of the variance ande the
mutations of the course of the Mune e fall vndirstand, that the mutatione and
variance of the mune, in sa money diverse sortis, procedis as i sal rehearse. The
mune is ane thik mass, round lyik ane boule or bal, heffand no lycht of her
self: for sche and all the vthir sternis resauis there lycht fra the soune, there
for sa mekil of the mune that hes her aspect touart the soune hes lycht, bot
the tothir half of the mune, that hes no aspect to the soune, resauis no lycht.
The cause quhy that the mune schauis lycht one time, and is obscure ane vthir
time, is be rason that sche is moir suift in her retrograid course nor the soune
is. for of her auen propir mouyng fra occident til orient in the zodiac, sche
cummis euyrie xxvij dais viij houris under the samyn degree that the sone is i^
til, at that time the vulgaris sais that the mune is in the co^iunctio^e vitht
the sone Sum time the mune is in oppositione, that is quhe^ the mune and the
soune ar in apposit degreis, tha^ ve see the may part of the lycht that the
mune hes resauit fra the soune, the vulgaris sais at that time, that the mune
is full. it nochtheles the mune is ay full, as veil at the conjunction as at the
appositione bot quhen the mune is in the eclipis for in the time of the eclipis
the ^ird is betuix the mune and the soune, quhilk is occasion that the mune
resau^ no lycht fra the soune at that time. There (...) ane vthir admiration of
the variant course (...) the mune, for sche resauis mair lycht in hy^
oppositione fra the soune, nor aptris till v^* The quhilk i sal preif be this
rason. Ane (...) roundnes of lycht, sal gyf lycht to mair no the half of ane
les roundnes be rason that the superfice of ane grit roundnes hes ane largea
aspect, touart ane roundnes, of ane les quantite nor ane small roundnes came hef
touar^ ane grit roundnes. There for sen the soune is of ane gritar qua^tite,
nor is the mune be tha^ cause, mair nor the half of the mune resauis lycht fra
the soune. bot it ve see nocht sa mekil lycht in the mune as sche hes resauit
fra the soune in her appositione. Ane parso^ that behaldis ^ne roundnes of ane
gritar quantite nor is the space betuix his tua even, that parson sal nocht see
sa mekil, as is the half of that roundnes be rason that the superfice of that
roundnes is of mair quantite nor is the space or largenes that is betuix his
tua even. The eclips of ^he soune.


Nou i will rehearse the cause of the eclipsis of the soune and mune. ve may

The visione that aperit before the actor in his sleipe. Chap. VII.
IN my dullit dreyme ande sopit visione, i thocht that there aperit to me, ane
lady of excellent extractione ande of anciant genolygie, makkand ane
melancolius cheir, for the grite violence, that sche head sustenit and indurit.
it aperit be her voful contenens, that sche vas in grite dout ande dreddour,
for ane mair dolorus future ruuyne, that vas aperand to succumb her haistylye,
in the may extreme exterminatione. her hayr of the color of fine gold, vas
feltrit and trachlit out of ordour, hingand over byr schuldirs. sche head ane
croune of gold, hingand and brangland, that it vas lyik to fall down fra her
head to the called eird. sche bure ane scheild in the quhilk vas grauit ane read
rampand lyo^ in ane field of gold, bordoryt about viht doubil flower delicis.
This read lion vas hurt in money placis of his body. the acoutreme^tis ande
clethyng of this dolorus lady vas ane side mantil, that couurit al her body of
ane meruelouse ingenius fassoune, the quhilk head been tissu ande vrocht be three
syndrye fassons of verkmenschips. the first part quhilk vas the hie bordour of
her mantil, there vas money precius stanis, quhar in there vas grauit, scheildis,
speyris, sourdis bayrdit horse harnes ande al vthir, sortis of vaupynis ande
munitions of veyr. in the middis of that mantil there vas grauit in carrecters
beukis ande figuris, diverse sciensis divine ande humain, vitht money cheretabil
actis ande supernatural miraclis. on the third part of that mantil, i beheld
brodrut about al her tail, al sortis of cattle ande profitabil beystis, al
sortis of cornis eyrbis, plantis, grene treis, schips, marchantdreis, ande money
politic verkmanlumis for mecanyc craftis. This mantil quhilk head been maid and
vrocht in ald tymys, be the prudent p^decessours of this foyr said lady, vas
reuyn and raggit i^ money placis, that skantly mycht i persaue the storcis ande
figuris that head been grauit vrocht ande brodrut in ald tymis in the three
partis of it. for the first part of it va^tit money of the scheildis ande harnes
that vas first vrocht in it ande ane vthir part of the scheildis and harnes var
brokyn ande roustit, ande reddye to fall ande tyne furtht of the bordour of that
mantil. Siklyik the pleisand verkmenschips that vas in the middis of her
mantil, vas seperat fra vthirs, ande altrit fra the first fass^ne, that na man
culd e^tract any profitabil sentens nor good exempil furtht of any part of it.
Nou to speik of the third part of her mantil, it vas verst grathit, ande spylt
be ane grit defferens nor vas the tothir tua partis of that mantil: for it
aperit that all the grene treis cornis bestialite mecanyc craftis ande schips
ande marchandreise, that head been curiouslye vrocht in ald tymis in the bordour
of the tail of that mantil, vas spilt ande distroyit, ande the eird vas becum
barran and stirril, ande that na ordinance of policye culd be persauit in it,
nor esperance of rele^f. Nou to conclude of the fassone of this ladeis mantil,
it vas baytht altrit in culour ande in beaulte, ande reuyn in money placis,
hingand down raggit in pecis, in sic ane sort, that gyf they head been present
that vrocht ande maid it in the beginning, thai vald have clair myskend it, be
rasone that it vas sa mekil altrit fra the first fassone. This affligit lady
beand of this sort troublit ande disaguisit, ande al her gaye cl^this reuyn and

l^mentabil r^grettis, vitht money salt teyris distilla^t down fra hyrpiteous

remeid, sche began to contempil the vi^thrid barran feildis, quhilkis in vthir
tymis head been fertile in all prosperiteis, quhar s^he persauit cummand tou^rt
her, three of her auen native natural sonnis. The eldest of them vas in harnes,

Machabe. 2.
Quhar is there ane mair evident exempil nor is in the bibil in the first beuk
of the machabeis, quhou anthiocus king of sirrie, be vsurpatione ande tirranrye
subdeuit the cu^tre of judah ande the cite of jerusalem? he spuleit the tempil
ande reft the goldin alter, the chandelaris of lycht, ande all the goldin

Of this sort (o e my five sonnis) e may believe that fra generation to

vitht ane gryt curage, heffand hope in god thai came contrair anthiocus and

venqueist men be came conqueriours and fugityuis be came assaileours, and humil
affligit pepil of ane lytil nu^mer be came lordis and masters of ane gryt
multiply of tirra^s. There is ane vthir exempil of gedeon in the time of the
cruel oppression that the king of madian did on the pepil of Israel gedeo^
vitht three hundre^ht men discumfeist ane hu^dretht and tuenty thousant men,
Iudicu^. 8.
and he delyuerit the remanent of the pepil of Israel fra captivity and misere
it nochtheles he vas ane pure lauberar of lytil reputatione and discendit of
small lineage of the tribe of menasses, quhar for ve may persaue that quhar the
grace of god and the virtue of men ar coniunit to giddir, there is no leiful
thing onpossibil to be exsecut, And ofttymis god puttis in the pouer of men the
thing that mennis vit ca^ nocht believe that it is possibil to be done. There is
ane vthir exempil of darius king of perse, that entrit in greece vitht ane
hundretht thousand fut men and ten thousand men of armis, At that time their
vas gryt sedition and discentione amang all the gryt personagis of greece quhair
for athenes vas of ane opinion to randir them to darius be rason that the

athenes callit miltiades quhilk vitht ten thousand men discumfeist al king
darius gryt army and delyuerit al greece furtht of captivity.

Their is ane vthir exe^pil of xerxes king of perse the sone of king darius
quha gadderit ane army of three scoir and ten thousand men of armis of his aue^
realm of perse, and alse he head of strangearis that var his frendis and of his

king of lacedemonia came be hynd the gryt army of perse vitht four hundretht
lace demoniens and escharmouschit xerxes gryt army and sleu tuenty thousand
persuns betuix tua hillis, it noththeles the remanent of his gryt army past
til athenes quhilkis var reddy to be randrit til xerxces throucht the counsel
of ane prince of athenes callit circisus quha head secret intelligens vitht
xerxes king of perse, quhilk vas occasion that he seducit diverse grit
personagis to rebel co^trar athenes. bot the prudent themosticles vas co^trair
til his opinione (saya^d) O nobil vailea^t pepil of athenes e should keyp the

vthir partis of greece that is nou in their subjection, there for it is mair
honest to dee in the deffens of our liberte nor to live lyik venqueist slauis
in captivity. Throcht the counsel of themistocles all the atheniens tuke gryt
curage contrar the gryt army of perse, and also the vemen of the town stanet
cyrsilus to deitht be cause of his evil counsel. Than the atheniens and there
allya be gryt vaileantnes assailet the persans be escharmouschis and incursions
quhil that exerxes and his gryt army var constreneit to depart fra greece. of
this sort god turnit the hazard of fortoune and tuke vengeance on xerxes gryt
pride quhilk should he ane gryt exempil til al princis, that thai gyf notht there
trest in ane particular pouer of multiply of men, bot rathere to set there
trest in god, for xerxes vitht four hundretht thousand men purposit til usurp
the dominione of al greece bot fra the time that the greikis accordit amang them
selfis ane sobir company of greikis chaissit the persans furtht of greece. It
is notht sex scoir of eiris sen the inglismen var violent dominatours of mekill

the king of ingland vas crounit king of France in Paris, bot as god vald, he
vas schamefully chaissit furtht of France and his pepil slane down be gryt

it nochtheles god almythty hauand pity of our affligit cu^tray he restorit
Robert bruce to the crone quha rytht vaileantly brocht the realm in guide

The actor declaris quhou the inglismen gifis vane credens to the prophesies of

THe orators of Ingland at there protectors instance hes set furtht ane buik
quhair be thai intend to preue that scotland vas ane colone of england quhe^
it vas first ^nhabit there raso^s that thai allege aperis to them to be

contrar the just verite. Augu. de ciui. dei. Li. 10. ca.
it notheles realmis ar nocht conquest be buikis bot rather be bluid. there is
ane passage in the said beuk the quilk the inglismen hes ane ardant desyr to se
it cum til effect. The tenor of the pass^ge sais that it var verray necessare
for the veilfayre of ingland and scotland that baytht the realmis var coniunit
to giddir, and to be under the gouuernyng of ane prince and the tua realmis to
be callit the i will of bertan as it vas i^ the beginning quhe^ the toria^ brutus
conquest it fra the giantis and also the inglismen gifis ferme credit to
diverse profane propheseis of merlyne and til vthir ald corruppit vaticiuaris,
to quhais ymaginet verkis thai give mair faitht nor to the prophecy of ysaye
Ezechiel, Jeremy or to the euangel: the quhilkis profane prophetis and
vaticinaris hes affermit in there rusty ryme that scotland and ingland sal be
under ane prince. The ardant desire and the disordinat auerisius affectione
that inglismen hes to be violent dominatours of our cuntray hes prouokit them
to make cruel veyris contrar us their money eiris by past, to that effect that
there diabolic profane propheseis may be fulfillit, nocht regard and give the
vil of god hes permittit be his divine gudnes that sic propheseis cum til
affect, Nor it thai considyr nocht that al propheseis hes doutsun, and duobil
expositionis. it nochtheles i hope in god that the rycht sens of there profane
prophesye sal be fulfillit in this generatione, and that inglismen, sal get
there desire to there perpetual confusione. the inglismen exponis the prophesye
of merlyne to there auen affectione as the iueis exponit the prophecy of
cayphas. Cayphas of ane evil intent spak treu prophesye, bot it he and the
iueis interpret it to the vrang sens, quhilk vas cause of there auen
condamnation. Of this sort cresus king of lidie exponit and interpret the
ansuer of apollo to the vrang sens, quhen the cruel veyris vas betuix him and
cirus king of per sand meid. At that time the tua gryt battellis of onnumerabil
men of veyr var campit neir to giddir, except that the reueir of almy ran
betuix them. On the morn king cresus past to the oracle of appollo in the
tempil of delphos ^^syrand to knau the fine of the veyris that vas sa cruel
betuix him and king cirus. Appollo gave to king cresus ane doutsum ansuere of
ambiguite this vas his ansuer, cresus perdet almi tra^sgressa maxima regna.
This vord perdet is ane verb equiuocum it signifeis to distroye and it
signifies to tyne it is vritin in the fyft psalm of David, perdes omnes qui
lo^uuntur mendacium. the expositione of this passage, signifies nocht that god
tynis them that are learis, for god can tyne na thing, there can no thing be
tynt bot quhen he that tynis ane thing, and syne knauis nocht quhair it is: bot
god knauis al thing. of this sort king cresus exponit the ansuer of appollo of
ane sens, Cresus per det almi transgressa maxima regna
and appollo said his ansuer of ane vthir sens Cresus interpret that verb
perdet for to distroye, and for that cause he and his gryt army past over the
reueir of almiin hope to distroye king cirus, bot cirus venquest cresus and al
his gryt army the quhilk mischief ca^on king cresus for the v^ang
interpretatione of the ansuer of appollo for he considerit nocht that perdet
vas ane verb equiuocum quhilk head ane expositione of ambiguite.

There is ane syklik exempil of pirrus king of eporite that past to the oracle
of appollo til inquyre of the fine of the veyris that vas betuix him and the
romany, appollo gave ane doutsum ansuere of this sort. dico te pirre romanos
vincere posse, Pirrus exponit that verse of this sort, pirre dico te vincere
romanos, bot appollo said it of ane vthyr sort, pirre dico romanos te vincere,
as came til effect eftyruart. for the romany venquest king pirrus and chaissit
him furtht of Italy. There is ane vthir exempil of ferrand erl of Fla^deris
quha maid mortal veyr contrar the ykng of France. he, his mother, and his vyfe,
Augureis ane person that tellis of thyngis that are to cu^ throucht, the
judgment that thai have of hirdis vocis and of therfleing
past til ane augure in holland til inquyre of the fine of the veyris betuix
him and the king of France. the augure ansuert. quod he thou sal entir in Paris
quhair that gryte tryumphe and joy sal be maid at thy entres. ferrand beand
rycht glaid of the ansuere of his augure he enterit i^ France vilht ane gryt
army bot or he came to Paris, he and his army var venqueist and he vas taken
presoner and led to paris than all the parisiens maid gryt triu^phe and joy for
blythtnes be cause that ferrand there mortel enemy vas disconfeist. Of this
fort, ferrand exponit the ansuere of his augure til ane vra^g sens. Th^r
exemplis may be conferrit and applyit vitht the prophesies of merlyne to the
quhilk the inglismen giffis mair confide^s nor thai gif to the euangel, be
cause that there ald profane propheseis sais that england and sco^la^d sal be
baitht under ane prince. on this misteous prophesels, thai have inte^dit veyris
co^trar scotland in hope to conques it: bot as i have before rehersit, i believe
that there prophecy sal cum til effect bot nocht to their inte^^ and that
ingland and scotland sal be ane monarche under ane prince in this generatione,
co^formand til ane prophecy that i have red in the inglis chronyklis in ane
beuk callit pollichornicon, the quhilk prophecy sais that ingland sal be first
conqueist be the deynis, and syne be the saxons, and thridly be the Normandis,
and there last conquessing sal be conquest be the s^octis, quhome inglismen
haldis may vile. and fra that time furtht england and scotland sal be bot ane
monarche, and sal live under ane prince, and sa inglis men sal get there
prophecy fulfillit to there auen mischief.

for he vsit the samen practik contrar irland and valis as sextus tarquinus

This vas the tenor of the said ordinance. in the first he ordand three

Quhou the affligit lady declaris til her three sonnis that the familiarite that
is betuix inglismen and scottis men in ane pace varld at morcattis and
co^nentions on the tua bordours is the cause of the traison that the scottis
men committis co^trar there natyfe cuntre. Chap. XIII.
THere is no thing that is occasion (O e my three sonnis) of our adhering to
the opinione of ingland co^trar our native cuntre bot the grit familiarite that
inglis men and scottis hes head on baitht the boirdours ilk ane vitht vtheris in
marcha^deis i^ selling and bying horse and nolt and scheip out fang and infang
ilk ane amang vtheris the quhilk familiarite is expres contrar the lauis and
consuetudis, baytht of ingland and scotland in the dais of moises the ieuis
durst nocht have familiarite vitht the samaritanis, nor vitht the philistie^s,
nor the romans vitht the affricans, nor the grekis vitht the persans, be rason
that ilk ane repute vtheris to be of ane barbir nature for euere nations
reputis vthers nations to be barbariens quhen there tua natours and complexions
ar contrar til vtheris, and there is noch^ tua nations under the firmament that are mai^ contrar and different fra vthirs, nor is inglismen and scottis men
quhoubeit that thai be vitht in ane i will and nythtbours, and of ane la^gage: for
inglis men ar subtle and scottis men ar facile, inglis men ar ambitius in
prosperity, and scottis men ar humain in prosperity, inglis men as humil quhen
thai ar subieckit be forse and violence, and scottis men ar furious quhen thai
ar violently subiekit inglis men ar cruel quhene thai get victory, and scottis
men ar merciful quhen thai get victory. and to co^nclude it is onpossibil that
scottis men and inglis men can remane in concord under ane monarche or ane
prince be cause there naturis and conditions ar as indefferent as is the nature
of scheip and volius. quintas cursius rehersis that darius king of perse send
ane imbassadour to alexander king of macedon and offrit him sax mulis chargit
vitht gold, sa that he vald live vitht him in pace and concord under ane crone
and monarche, alexander ansuert to the imbassadour, quod he it is as onpossibil
to gar me and king darius duel to giddir in pace and concord under ane monarche
as it is onpossibil that tua sonnis and tua munis can be at one time to giddir
in the firmament. This exempil may be apply it to ingland and scotland for i
trou it is as ompossibil to gar inglis men and scottis men remane in good
accord under ane prince, as it is on possibil that tua sonnis and tua munis can
be at one time to giddir i^t he lift, be raison of the grit defferens that is
betuix there naturis and conditions, quhar for as i hef before rehersit there
should be na familiarite betuix inglis men and scottis men be cause of the grit
defferens that is betuix there tua naturis in ald tymis it vas determit in the
artiklis of the pace be the tua vardanis of the bordours of ingland and
scotland, that there should be na familiarite betuix scottis men and inglis men
nor marriage to be contrakit betuix them, nor conuentions on holy dais at gammis
and plays, nor marcha^dres to be maid amang the^, nor scottis me^ til entir on
inglis grond vitht out the king of england sa^e conduct, nor inglis men til
entir on scottis gro^d vithtout the king of scotla^dis save conduct, quhou beit
that there var sure pace betuix the tua realmis, bot their scuyn eir bygane thai

lang time betuix inglis men and scottis men baytht in pace and in veir, as
scottis men vsis ama^g theme selfis vitht i^ the realm of scotland. and sic
familiarite hes been the cause that the king of ingland gat intellegens vitht
diverse gentil men of scotland. it is nocht possibil to keip sne realm fra
conspiratione and trason fra time that the pepil of that realm vsis
familiarite vitht there enemeis there is ane ald proverb that says, that ane
herand damysele and ane spekand castle sal neuyrend vith honor, for the
damysele that heris and giffis eyris to the amourus persuasions of desolut ong
men sal be eysile persuadit to brac her chaistite siklik ane spekand castle,
that is to say quhen the captan or sodiours of ane castle vsis familiar speech
and comionyng vitht there enemeis that castle sal be eysylie conquest be rason
that familiarite and speech betuix enemeis generis trason. in ald tymis the
vaileant annibal and vtheris grit captans baitht romans and grecians, thai set
mair there felecite to purches secret familiarite and comonyng vitht there

vthers Their vordis of iugurtha makkis manifest that there is nay thing that

the pepil hes vitht there enemeis, throucht the quhilk familiarite there is sum
evil persoune that knauis the secret determinations of the lordis of the

that perpetratis this traisonabil act, bot it i am sure that as sune as the
lordis of the counsel hes determit any guide purpos for the deffens and

quhou that quintus metellus beand proconsul of rome vas send vitht ane army in
to spane co^trar the celtibriens quhilkis duellit in the realm of nauerne.
Valerius maximus. Libro. 7.
he set ane seige about the town of tribie quhilki is the methropolitane and
capital cite of that cuntre, that cite resistir and deffendit vaileantly
contrar quintus metellus, than he beand in melancole be cause he culd nocht

tounis of nauern, sum time bakuart sum time forduart, sum time he past to the
montannis, and sum time to the valeis, and remanit never in ane stedefast

agitatione and commotione of his army up and down, vas nocht knauen be none of
his men of veyr nor it knauen be his enemes, quhar for ane of his familiar
fre^dis inquyrit him of the cause of his inconsta^t vagatione, quha ansuert,
quod he decist and inquyre na mair of that purpos, for gif that i vndirstude
that my sark head knaulege of my secret or of the deliberatione of my mind,
doutles i should birn it hastelye in ane bald fyir. than quhen metellus head vagit
up and down there ane lang time, and head put his host and army in ignorance,
and his enemes in error eftir diverse turna^d coursis, at hourtht the cu^tre,
he returnit suddanlye to the forsaid town of tribie and laid ane sege about it
or his enemes var aduertest to make deffens, and sa be this dissimilatione and
be the keeping of his counsel secret fra his frendis and fra al vtheris, he
conquest the said town. vald god that the counsel and deliberatione of
scotland var kepit as secret as metellus kepit his secret fra his men of veyr,
than doutles the inglis men vald nocht be so bold. There is na thing that is
cause that the counsel of ingland gettis sa haisty aduertessing of the
priuitate that is ama^g the lordis of scotland bot the vice of auareis that hes
blyndit the raiso^ and hes infekkit the har^is of diverse grit me^ of scotland
the ald proverb is treu that sais that it is as onpossibil to gar ane auaricius

quha head mortal veyr contrar the grekis. he send ane rich present extendant
til three scoir of thousa^dis pieces of gold til ane nobil man of athenes cal^it
phosion, ane man heffand great autorite in athenes. Tha^ phosion said to the
inbassadours of king allexander quoth he my frendis, for quhat cause hes king
allexander send this rich present of gold to me alanerly, ande hes send na
thing to the remane^t of the lordis of athenes. The inbassadour ansuert, our
master king allexander hes send ou this present of gold, be raison that he hes
iugit ou to be the may nobil ande may verteous, abufe al them of athenes.
phosion ansuert. gyf that king allexander hes iug^t me to be of grit prudens
ande virtue, e sal pray him to thole me to remane prudent and verteous for gyf
i tak his present of gold tha^ i am nothir prudent nor verteous, for there is
no thing mair regu^gna^t to prude^s nor virtue nor quhen ane person resauis gold
or reches fra his enemee. there for e sal tell to our master king allexander,
that he sal nocht corrupt me vitht gold nor venqueis me in battle, nor it he
sal conqueis na thing in greece bot sa mekil eird as vil be sepulturis til his
nen of veyr. this exe^pil makkis manifest that quhen ane prince presentis gold
ande siluyr to the subiectis of bis enemei doutles his intention is to seduce
them to conspire ande to betraise there native cu^tre. quhar for i exort ou (my
three somnis) that e detest auerese ambicion ande traison, ande that e gar our
solistnes of the deffens of our comont veil, preffer the solistnes of our
particular veil: for quhe^ our particular veil is spuleit or hurt be our
enemeis it may be remedit be our comont veil. ande in opposite, gyf our comont
veil be distroyt than it sal neuyr be remedit be our particular veil, for our
particular veil is bot ane accessor of our comont veil ande the accessor
follouis the nature of the prencipal, accessoriu^ sequitur naturam sui

There is ane exe^pil quhou that eftir the dolorus battle of cannes quhilk i hef

There is ane vdir exempil of the punitione of traturs as thucidides the
historien greik rehersis in the xv cheptor of his first beuk, quhen pausanias
quha head commissione of the army of the lacedemoniens quhen he past to defend
hellespont he vas depriuit of that dignite be cause he head intellegens vitht

it vas ane of the subiectis of rome. bot notheles his purpos vas to pas to the
king of meid quha vas mortal eneme to al greice in hope to conueen and accord
vitht the said king of meid contrar the greikis. t^a^ to make his traison mair
patent, he send ane certan of presoners of meid to the king and he gart the
bruit gang that thai presoneris head eschaipit and brokyn the preson co^trar his

bia^te quhen the king of meid head left them in garnison to kep the said cite
fra the grekis and also he vreit ane lettir to the king of meid as eftir

Pausanias duc of spart, to the king xerxes salut, i hef send to the their
presoners the quhilk i hef conquest in fair and honest veyris, contrar the
quhilk present i hef send to the, to that effect that i may conques thy love

gef commissione til accord vitht pausanias. this vas the tenor of exerxces
vryting. King exerxes of meid to pausanias salut, i thank the of the pleseir

vyf, thou sal gif credence to this berar artabasus, quha is my secretar and my

meid he began euere day to prattik his intent contrar the grekis and als he be
came familiar vitht the barbariens the quhilk familiarite vas occasion that the
grekis tuke ane real suspetione and ane vehement imaginatione of his
co^iuratione and conspiratione. quhar for til eschaip the danger and damage
that mytht succeed fra his trason, the ephores of lacedemonia send there sergent
to summond him to compeir in the town of spart under the pane to be reput
rebel and enemy to greece. tha^ he beleua^d to keip him fra ane gritar
suspetione and als he fand hope to purge him of al crimes throcht giftis and
money that he thocht to distribut amang the senaturis of lacedemonia, he past

constitut him presoneir for the ephores of lacedemonia var of sa grit authorite
that thai mycht constitut and compel there king or there duc to be presoneir. the

quhar he gat the samyn thing i^ the^ quhilk he suspekit and doubtit of hefor,
that is to say quhou that pausanias vrit to artabasus to resaif his vrytingis
and there eftir to s^a the messengeir, this said seruitur brocht the vrytingis

ane seruand that offensit his master vas punest be the iugis as ane trespassar

pausanias quhou that his seruitur head taken gyrtht in the tempil for sum crime

Pausanias beand aduertest of the presonyng of his seruand past incontenent to

Ter is ane vthir exempif of the punitione of trason in the first cheptor of
the second beuk of samuel quhen the philistiens faucht in ane battle contrar

There is ane vthir exempil of the punitione of trason as is vrytin in the fyft

O my natural mother, my co^playnt is hauy to be tald, bot it is mair displesand

sal cum haistyly on them be the rycht judgment of god, conformand to the vordis
of the prophet, propter miseriam inopum and gemitum pauperum nu^c exurgam dicit
dominus that is to say be the expositio^e of the doctoris. for the misere of
mistirful men, and for the vepyng of pure men, the divine justice sal exsecut

disparit of my lyif, necessite pulsis and constrenes me to cry on god and to
desire vengeance on them that persecutis me, in hope that he vil releif me or
else to tak me furtht of this miserabil lyif, for the ingratitude of my tua
brethir, there dissolutione, and the mysknaulage of god, and there disordinat
misgouernance, is the cause of my impatie^s, and cause of al my afflictione,
for as there evil conquest reches multiplies, there disordinat pomp and there
delicius ydilnes vitht misknaulahe of god augmentis, quhilk is occasion that
tha ar ambitius in there stait, couetuse of gudis and desirus to be gouernouris

my tua brethir nobillis and clergy ar in sic melancole be cause that i

therefore my i^pacie^s should be supportit be cause that the occasion of it hes

there is sum good and sum evil, and first to speik of the deffere^s of kyngis,
david that roial prophet, vas ane holy king, and king saul vas cruel and

mother thou erris in thy accusatione, in sa far as thou makis na acceptione of

concludit be al lauis, divine and humain, that euere person sal bayr his auen

that throcht pouerte of gudis and trocht debilite of my person, i can nothir
do good to my frendis nor evil to my enemes. quharfor i exort the til altir thy

proverb may be applyit to my dolorus fortoune, for i may be comparit til him
that is deed in his sepulture considerand that there can be na dolor eikit to

thai sal neuyr ken god nor it sal hef pity of pure affligit pepil. the quhilk

lamentabil complaynt procedis fra ane affligit heart, quharfor i exort the to

for thy vordis ar verra iniurius vitht out perspectione to the verite thou

that trason is neuyr generit nor inuentit in the hartis of the pure comontis,
and quhou beit that there ignorance culd gar the^ cansaue ane grondit maleis
contrar ane prince that hes perpetrat exactionis on the pepil, it notheles thai
hef nothir prude^s nor knaulege til conuoye and til exsecut any point of
trason. there for quhen the committaris of trason ar tryit furtht, it sal be
fundyn that i and al vthir of my faculte sal be clean and innocentis of that
foul crime, be rason that it is nocht possibil that ane pure man can have
oportunite til exsecut ane traisonabil act contrar ane prince be cause of sa
money disicil impedime^tis that may impesche him, as pouerte dreddour ignorance
and notht hefand familiarite vitht ane prince, and the perellis and dangers
that may succed fra coniurationis ar vondir grit nocht alanerly in the
conuoyng and in the diuising diverse consaitis to bring there purpos til
effect, bot as veil the dangeir and perrel is as grit in the exsecutione of it
and na les danger and perrel eftir that it be exsecut therefore i think that ane
pure man can commit na trason contrar ane prince, bot gif that he vald haszard
his lyif in ane disparit vilfulnes and quhar any man takis hardynes to commit
trason of that sort it is rycht seyndil seen that he eschapis the deitht in the
present time of his exsecutione. there for i can nocht belief that any person
vil offir him self til ane certan detht vilfully, for quhou beit that pausanias
sleu philip king of macedon passand to the tempil quhar he head ane thou^and of
his men of armis about him in the presens of his sone and of his good sone, it
noththeles that act culd neuyr hef been exsecut head nocht been that pausanias

that ringis nou prese^tlye, that schot, sleu nocht basit bot it the exsecutio^e
of that act culd nocht hef been vitht out hardynes and oportunite therefore O my
desolat mother ve that are pure lauberaris should neuir be suspekkit of trason,
considerand that ve have nothir time, oportunite, reches, credens, hardynes,
prude^s, nor familiarite vitht ane prince, therefore al historiographours
rehersis that al coniurations hes been exsecut be grit personagis of ane realm
or ellis be the familiaris seruandis of ane prince. there for ve that are pure
comontis distitut of credit, prudens, and autorite, and nocht heffand
familiarite vitht the majesty of ane prince, ve can hef na comodite of the
necessair thingis that are requirit to put ane trasonabil act til exsecutione,
for quhou beit that our ignorance vald gar us consaue ane malicius intent

speciale in causis of trason, for euere person hes sum fre^d that he louis as
veil as him self, and that friend hes ane vthir friend, and that tothir friend
hes the third friend, and the third friend hes the feyrd friend and of this sort
there intrepricis is manifest, fra the quhilk succedis perdition of body and
gudis. for there is nocht money men i^ this varld bot sum vil schau there secret
to there brother, or to there companone, or to there vyfe or to there familiar

to be discouuert be there seruandis or childir troucht suspectione and
conjecture that occurris quhe^ their coniuratours ar over ample and plane in
there deliberatione of there purpos ande of there entreprice in the presens of
there serua^dis and childir, as is rehersit in the fy^st be^k of titus liuius
that quhen the sonnis of brutus var make and ane sedicius pactione vitht the
imbassadours of tarquinus quhilk there father brutus head bannest fra rome, at
that time ane seruand of the sonnis of brutus herd all the pactione of the
coniuratione the quhilk seruad accusit them of trason to there fat^^re brutus,
and to the senate quilk vas occasion that brutus vsit extreme justice on his
tua sonnis nocht heffand regard to the pity that fathers hes touuart there
natural sonnis, bot rather he did preffer the public veil before natural love
quhen he gart strik the heydis fra his tua ong sonnis. Sum time coniuration is
reuelit ^hroucht facilnes of the co^iuratours that schauis there secret til ane
voman or til any friend that thai love hartfully, as did ane gentil man callit
dinus qusia vas participant of the coniuratione that philotes intendit til
exsecut contrar king allexander, this foir said dinus reuelit his secreit til
ane o^g child that he louit callit nic^macus, ande nicomacus reuelit that samyn
secret til his brother ciballinus. and ciballinus reuelit it til king alexander
quhilk vas occasion that the coniuratours suffrit the detht. Therefore (o my
dolorus mothere) thou may considir that the defeculte of the comitting of
trason is vondir grit, and the perrel and the dangeir that succedis is na les,
quharfor grit men and alse the familiaris of princis that coniuris, ar affligit
in there heart vitht ane thousand deffeculteis or tha tak on hand til exsecute

vengeance that pure comontis can exsecut co^trar ane evil prince is to gar our
vyuis and bayrnis pray nycht and day to send ane mischief on him and to send
him schort live dais and to send ane vthir good prince in his place co^formand
to the prayer of sanct david in the 108 psalm of his psalter quhi^k sais
etene^ occidantur qui no sperturbant, fiant filij eius orphani, and episcopatum

quhe^ve happyn to cu^ in any straynge company, ve pray deuotly vitht ane fenet

he did mair extorsions to the pepil nor did his father, quharfor i prayt to the

quhilk the inglis men poflest violentlye, gart it be forse til us to be assurit
or ellis ve head lossit al our gudis, and our selfis til hef been slane. for it

bot nou at this dolorus time ve ar constrenet to be assurit the quhilk

confiderand as the bissynes of the cuntre standis presentlye. for ane
dissimilatione that procedis nocht of ane astuce intent should be callit ane hie

heffand dreddor to be slane be his oncle, and to tyne his patrimo^e, he of ane

iunius brutus persauand the commotione of the pepil, he thocht it couenient

to the frendis of lucrecia and til diverse other nobil romans and gart them
depone ane serment that thai should al concur and conuene to gidthir in ane

and bettir kepit, for brutus and the vaileand romans bannest tarquinus fra rome
and al them of that surname quhilk vas occasio^e that the comont veil of rome

Bot it is nocht siklyik amang the pepil for every man settis his felicite to

ande nobilnes, i will discriue the stait of nobilnes ande ge^tilnes, to that
effect that e may persaue our grit error.

THE PHILOSOPHOVR'S ande ^^r^sconsultours in the ancient dais, hes familiarly
discriuit one thing be the contrar thing. thai gart the discriptio^e of ane
vilaine (quhilk ve call ane carlin our scottis langage) manifest the conditions
of ane gentil man siclyik thai gart the discriptione of ane gentil man manifest
the condition of ane villain be rason that ane gentil man or ane nobil man.
ande ane villain hes direct contrar conditions, and sa be the discriptione of
any ane of their tua contrareis, tha gat ane solid knaulage of the tothir.
Siklyik quhen thai discriuit virtue, tha first delatit ande payntit the
conditions of vice, ande quhen thai discriuit liberte, thai first payntit ande
dilatit the condition^ of servitude. And nou sen this purpos hes occurrit to
speik of gentreis ande nobilnes, i will first discrine the origin of gentil men
be the quhilk e may knau, quha is ane vilaine. Bot first i man rehearse the
stait of the pepil that var in the good anciant dais quhilk sum men callit the
goldin varld, there vas na defferens of staitis at that time amang men, ^othir
in preeminens dignite superiorite nor honor, for at that time, al men var
egal, and nocht partial nor deuidit, for the pepil lyuit al to gydthir in ane
tranquil and l^uabil co^munite, ande thai left no thing to there posterite, bot
regrettis for the alteratione of that good varld. in thai dais the pepil eit
nor drank nocht bot quhen hungir constrenet them and than there may delegat
refectio^e vas acquorns, vyild berreis, green frutis, rutis and eirbi^ ande
thai drank the fresche vattir. at sum time they past in the forrestis to the
course and hunting, and sleu vyild beystis syne dryit the flasche at the sune
or thai eit it. and thai that var of may tendir conplexione, couurit the^
vitht the skynnis of tha vyild beystis to keip them fra called At that time there
vas no ceremonial reuerens nor stait, quha should pas before or behynd, furtht or
in at the dur, nor it quha should have the dignite to vasche there ha^dis first in
the bassine nor it quha should sit down first at the tabil. at that tym^ the
pepil var as reddy to drynk vattir in there bonet or in the palmis of there
handis as in ane glass or in ane tasse of siluyr. At that time thai la^
altogydthir in ane cauerne, as dois presenti the sophistic egiptiens. thai
purgit there belleis ande excercit the verkis of nature, ilk ane in vthirs
presens vitht out schame reproach or offens. than ane lang time there eftir
nature prouokit the^ to begin sum litil police. for sum of them began to plant
treis, sum to da^t beystis, sum gadthrid the frutis, ande kepit them quhil on
to the time of necessite, ande sum neureist there childir, at that time the
pepil drank nothir ^yne nor beir, nor na vthir confekkit drynkis. at that time
straynge cu^treis var nocht socht, to get spicis eirbis drogis gu^mis and
succur for to make exquisit electuars to provoke the pepil til ane disordinat
appetit. At that time there vas no sumpteous clothyng of fine claytht and of
gold and silk of diverse fassons. at that time i^ the beginning of there police,
coppir bras and yrn and vthir mettellis var meltit to make vte^sel veschel
necessair to serve ane houshald and var nocht meltit to be gunnis ande cannons
to sla down the pepil. Ande nou sen that goldin varld is past, there hes
succedit ane yrn varld, quhilk hes altrit every good thing in infelicite and
myscheif, for meiknes is changit i^ maleis, trauail in ydilnes, rest in
excess, pace in veyr, eyse in pane, love in hatrent, cherite in crualte,
justice in extorsions, almis in thyft, kyndnes in persecutione, supporting of
ignorance in detractione pity in rigor, ande faytht in ypocrysie, and sa
euyrie thing is altrit fra ane good stait in ane abho minabil qualite. The
cause of this alteratione hes procedit fra the evil co^ditio^s of men that
began till oppress there mychtbours, ande til eschaip sic oppressione, the
pepil chesit ane certan of gouuernours of the may robust and ma^st prudent to
be there deffendours, ande alse thai randrit the^ tributaris ande subiectis to
there said gouuernours and there gouuernous gat for there panis and laubyr the
butin and spule that thai co^queist fra the tirran oppressors. Thai
gouuernours var sa nobil in there auen curage that thai distrubut the may
part of the butine ande spule ama^g the pepil that head vsit them may
vaileantly contrar there enemeis, ande thai that var lasche couuardis gat
nothing. Of this sort began the first nobilnes ande gentreis in the varld, for
thai that var vaileant, thai var reput for nobilis ande gentil men, ande thai
that var vicius and couuardis var reput for vilainis ande carlis. The
chartagiens vsit that sammyn fassoune ane lang time for thai gave to the
sodiours that bure them may vaileantly contrar there enemeis, ane certan of
gold ringis, for ane takyn of perpetual nobilite. Siklyik euyrie vaileant roman
sodiour vas crounit vitht ane croune on his head in takyn of nobilite. The
macedoniens vsit that sammyn use ane lang time, ande quhen ane macedonien head
nocht venqueist ane of his enemeis, he vas bundin til ane post, ande degradit
fra his nobilite. in ald tymis i^ germanye, ane al man vas ay repute for ane
villain, quhil on to the time that he vas mareit, and he gat neuyr lecens to
marye, quhil on to the time, that he head presentit the head of ane of his
enemeis to the king of germanye. Siklyik in sythia at ane banquet of tryumphe,
the king presentit ane goldin tasse full of vine to the company at the tabil.
bot nane of them vas admittit to drynk in that tasse, bot sa money as head
venqueist ane of there enemeis in ane conflict, for he that head neuyr dune ane
vaileant act contrar his enemeis, vas reput for ane inciuile villain.
Mardochens conqueist the gre of nobilite fra artaxerxes throucht his virtue,
ande Iosehp vas maid ane gentil man be pha^aon for his virtue. Than the
successors of thi^ nobil men var repute for gentil men as lang as thai vsit
verteous verkis of nobilite, as did there predecessors. Bot fra time that the
successors of their nobil men, be came vicius, than tha var degradit fra there
nobilite and^ fra i bear gentreis, and thai var repute for inciuile vilaynis.
Valerius maximus rehersis the nobilite of scipio the affrican, Valerius
maximus. Li. ^. ca. 5.
quha head ane soune that vas nothir vaileant nor verteous. on ane day, he
bea^d clet hid i^ ane lang quhyt goune, as the use vas to be borne at the
distributione of the officis of rome, he desirit the office of pretoir at the
senate, on ane place callit campus martius. At that time, his frendis came til
him, and but reuerens, thai reft fra him ane signet of gold that vas on his
fingare, vitht in the quhilk vas grauit his fathers head, say and til him, o
inperfect ande vicius contrafait gentil man, thou deseruis nocht to veyr this
nobil signet, vitht in the quhilk is grauit thy fathers head, considera^d that
thou hes nothir virtue nor vaileantnes, there for ve degraid the, frathe
nobilite ande gentreis, that thou pretendit to succeid to, be the deceisse of
thy fathere. This exempil of scipio makkis manifest, that na man can mereit or
can be capabil of nobilnes or ge^treis bot gyf tha be verteous. There for that
stait of gentreis is ane accidental qualite, in sa far as it may cum til ane
persoune be his virtue, ande he may be degradit fra it for his vice. (O my
eldest soune nobilis and gentil men) the armies that e bair in our scheildis and
in our seylis in our signetis, and alse is payntit on our vallis and in our
glasyn vin dois, thai var gyuyn to our p^decessours, be the prince, for ane
takyn of nobilnes, for the nobil actis that they head dune for the como^^ veil
of the realm and e that are there successors e bayr the samyn armis for ane
takyn that e ar obleist to follou the futsteppis of our predecessors in virtue.
or ellis e merit to be degradit fra the armis that e bair and fra the gentreis
that e profess, as vas dune till o^g scipio before rehersit. There is diverse
princis that gyffis the tryumphe of knychted and nobilite, vitht leuerairis,
armis ande hertetage to them that hes committit vaileant actis in the veyris,
siklyik as the empriour makkis the ordur of knychthed of the fleise the king of
France makkis the ordour of the c^kkil the king of england makkis he ordour of
knychthede of the garta^. None of their knychtis resauis their hie digniteis,
throucht ane affectuy love that there prince hes touart the^. bot rathere for
the vaileant actis that there prince hes knauen them til have committit for
there public veil. Valerius maximus in the cheptor of tryumphe.
The romans in the anciant dais, ordand ane tryu^phe of nobilite to be gyffin
to them that head borne them may vaileantly contrar the enemeis of rome. The
ordour of there tryumphe vas of this sort, quhen any roman head dune ane
vaileant act, he vas set in ane chariot veil acoutreit, quhilk vas drauen
vitht four hor^e, be cause in the ancia^t dais, the romans vsit to fecht in
battle in charriotis. Than he that head venqueist his enemy be straikis ande
string battle he vas crounit vitht ane palm of gold, be rason that the palm
tree hes schearp broddis and pikis. And he that head venqueist his enemy, be
practik of veyr ande sleu and tuke his enemeis flea^d fra the battle vitht out
hurt til him, he vas crounit vitht ane croune of laure tree, be cause the laure
tree hes no schearp broddis nor pikis. This last tryumphe of laure tree vas
callit tropheum, quhilk singnifeis ane joyful victoree, for the victoree is
joyful quhen the enemeis ar venqueist vithtout damage to the ve^quesair. quhen
their romans entrit in rome to resaue there tryu^phe for there vaileant actis,
the senate the gentil men and the comont pepil met them in there best array
vitht grit solempnite, and syne conuoyit them to the plane market before the
capitol to resaue there tryumphe of dignite as tha head deseruit. Bot allace (o
e my eldest sone nobilis ande gentil men) there is nocht money of ou that
meritis to veyr the ensene of the fleise, of the cokkil nor of the gartan, nor
it there is nocht money of ou that meritis to be borne in ane chariot to resane
the tryumphe of the palm tree nor of the laure tree, for our imbecilite auereis
ande contentione that ringis amang ou, rather deseruis degrading fra our
pretendit gentreis, nor e deserne loving or commedation for virtue. There for e
ar in grit error quhen e profess ou to be gentil men, and syne committis no
actis efferand for our professione bot vald e considir the origin of our
gentreis, than e vald nocht be sa arrogant as to desire the gloir and the stait
of ane dignite that e deserve nocht. There is money of ou that professis to be
gentil men be successione of our predecessors bot e co^sidir nocht that the
gre of ge^treis procedis fra virtue. The philosophour sais that the cause of ane
thing is of mair efficacite, nor is the thing that procedis fra the cause, ergo
virtue should preffer the successors of verteous men. Ane verteous man beand
discendit of ane verteous genoligie doutles he is ane rycht gentil man, and in
opposite, ane vicius man beand discendit of verteous genoligie, he should be reput
mair vile and odius nor any infamous vilaine plebien, ande alse thai should be
degradit fra there ga^treis that thai have ascribit til have be successione,
ande thai should be conpellit to virk vile mecanyk laubir to that effect that the
honor of verteous gentil men, be nocht maculat vitht the vice ande inciuilite
of vicius pretendit gentil men. There for as i have said of before the sone of
ane prince beand distitut of virtue is no gentil man, ande in apposit ane sone
of ane mechanyc plebien bea^d verteous he is ane gentil man for that cause the
poiet francis petrarcha florentyne said, i head leuyr be the sone of vicius
tarsites i vsand ane verteous conuersatione nor to be the sone of the vaileant
achilles i beand vicius. The philosophour plutarque rehersis, that iphicrate^
vas ane pure mecanyk craftis man discendit of inciuil plebiens it nochtheles
throucht his virtue he vas elect to be king of the cuntre, there vas ane vicius
gentil man at that time callit hermodius quha reprocht iphicrates, sayand, o
iphicrates it esseris nocht for thy stait and faculte to be ane king be rason
that thy father vas ane mecanyc tailour discendit of inciuile pure pepil, there
for thou art nocht ane gentil man. iphicrates ansuert, o hermodius, throucht my
virtue, my successors sal be reput gentil men, and sa my gentreis begynnis at
my self bot thou ande thy gentreis sal end to gydthir, and thy successors sal
be reput for vilaynis be cause of thy vicius co^uersatione. This exempil makkis
manifest, that ane person may succeid to heretage and to mouabil gudis of his
predecessors bot no man can succeid to gentreis nor to virtue, for vertie and
gentreis most proceid fra the spreit of him self and nocht fra his
pre^ecessours. iuuenal the poiet rehersis, that buciphal the grit horse of
allexa^der head money comodius propreteis for as sune as he s^u alexander, he
knelit ande maid him reuertens, ande syne thoht him to lope on him, and al^e he
vas strynthy ande auful in ane battle contrar the enemeis of alexander. ande
quhen he vas saidlyt vitht his best bayrdit harnessing, he vald thole no man to
ride on him bot alexander. This samyn horse busiphal head ane brother, generit
and folit of the samyn horse and meyr that folit him. this to their horse vas
grit fair and good lyik, bot nochtheles the may perfyit industreus horse
dantars of macedon culd nocht gar him be veil br^dilit nor mane^ir in na
comodius sort convenient to serve ane prince, q^har for he vas nocht treittit
bot rather deiekkit ande chaissit to the vyild barran f^ildis to seik his meyt,
ande often tymis he vas put in ane cart to drug and drau, quhar he vas evil dung
and broddit.

This exempil may be conferrit to t^a brethir gottin ande borne of ane fathere
and ^other ane of them beand verteours should be reput for ane gentil man. and
the the other beand vicius fuld be estemeit and reittit lyik ane bar bir inciuil
vilaine. There hes been diverse ge^til me^ that thynkis schame that there
fathe^s and mothers gudschers and grandsch^us hes been mechanyt blebiens, Bot
sic vane gentil men takkis nocht exempil of agathocles the king of ce^lle, quha
vas the fone of ane pottar that formit clay pottis, it nochtheles quhe^ he vas
elect i^ dignite royal, he gart gold smythis grave ane pot in his armies on
every piece of his siluyr veschel, and alse he gart paynt the vallis of
hispalleis vitht pottis, the quhilk thing he did to ^anifest to the pepil that
he thocht noschame that his father head been ane mecanyc craftis ma disce^dit of
ane pure genoligie. Iuuenal Satiric. 7
it is ane grit soly til ane pers^n to pretend to gentreis be successione or be
reches innenal conf^rmis this samyn purpos, nobilitas sola est animu^ que
moribus orna^, and the vordis of ovid ar consonant to this samyn, Non ce^sus
nec clarum nomen auoru^, sed probitas magnum ingeniumque facit.

There for it is grit arrogance and nales folly quhen any person gloris in his
hie genoligie considerand that euyre person is discendit of ane origyne, as
boiecius de consolatione hes rehersit in his third beuk. Boiecus de
consolatione philosophy.. li. 3.
Omne hominum genus in terris simili surgit ab ortu. there for vald euyrie man
cosidir his first origyne he sal find that al man kind ar creat of mud and clay
as is vritin in the sycond cheptour of genesis, Formauit igitur homine^ de limo
terre. ande alse Ihesus sirach sais in the 10 cheptour of ecclesiasticus, quhar
he repreuis the gloir ande pride of men quid superbis terra et ciuis, that is
to say, quhou ar e becum predeful, and takkis gloir in this varld? considerand
that e ar bot eird ande puldir. it is vrityn on the 18 cheptour of genesis,
loquar ad dominum cum sim puluis and ciuis. that is to say, i sal speik to the
lord, quhou be it i am bot puldi^ ande ass. it is vrityn in the 17 cheptour of
ecclesiasticus, Omnes homines terra et ciuis, al men ar eird ande alse.

Their exemplis should be occasion to gar gentil men, paynt in there scheildis,
ande grave in there signetis, puldir ase ande eirde, rather nor til have gart
paynt ande grave the armis of there predecessors, be rason that fra time that
thai be aryuit to the fine ande to the liuitis of there peregrinatione of this
mortal lyif. than thai return to there comont ande general mothere the eird,
the quhilk eird makkis na acceptions of persons nor defferens of qualiteis
betuix gentil men, and mecanyc men, bot resauis them al indefferently in her
domicil and receptacle than quhen the corrupit flesche is consumit fra the
banis, no man can put defferens b^t^ix ane prince ane beggar. The
historigraphours rehersis, that quhen king cirus he^ ven qu^^st king cresus, he
led him til his p^^ets ande treittit him mair humainly, nor is the use to treit
presoneirs. On one day cresus spak hardyly to king cirus sayand, Nobil prince
the vulgaris ascribis grite gloir for the vailyeant actis that thou hes
committit for the public veil of perse ande meid, it nochtheles thy father
cambifes did mair vaileant actis in his time, nor thou hes dune. king cresus
vas temerair i^ his question for cirus vas offe^dit co^trar king cresus
thinkand that ane presoneir should nocht have been sa bold, as til reproach ane
prince that haldis him in captivity. Than cresus persauand king cirus in
collere and ire, he said, nobil prince gyf thy nobil grace vil gyf me lecens to
rason the matter, thou sal sune persaue that i said nothing till offend the, bot
rathere til augment thy gloir. i said that thy grace head nocht dune sic ane
vaileant act, as thy fathere ca^bises did in his time, for he did ane nobil
act, quhen he engeneret the on thy mothere to gouuerne this realm eftir his
deceisse, bot thou hes nocht dune sic ane nobil act, as to genner ane nobil
prince lyik thy self to gouuerne the realm quhen thou art deed.

Quhen king cirus herd the subtle discymilit pleisant interpretatione of cresus
vordis, he smylit and leuch and changit his collar in glaydnes. bot it king
cirus exortit cresus familiarlye till expone the just verite of his vordis.
Cresus ansuert, nobil prince, sen thou hes coniurit me sa extremly to decl^ir
the verite, doutles i sal hald no thing obscure, quhou be it thou gar me suffer
the cruel detht the occasion of my vordis procedit, be cause i judge that thou
art nocht sa quyk spretit, sa prudent nor sa nobil, as vas thy fathere
cambises, ande to conclude, thou hes nocht sic ane head, as he head in all his
byssynes. king cirus ansuert, i sal sune knau the verite of thy purpos. than
king cirus past to the tempil ande he gart delue up all the ba^is of the detht
pepil furtht of there sepulture and keist over euyrye bane ande contemplit
euyry hardyn pan, ane be ane than cresus and vthir gentil men metuelit noc^t
litil of his consait, sayand, ve exort the nobil prince to tell thy intention
of that byssynes. Cirus ansuert o cresus thou said, nocht lang syne, that my
head vas nocht to be comparit to my fathers head, there for i am leukand gy i
ca^ find my fathers hardyn pan, amang their deed mennis banis bot i can nocht
ken it amang them for all the hardyn pannis that are heir ar al of ane sort,
there for i believe that my fathers head ande my head and al vthir mennis hedis
of pure ande rich ar but desserens, there for in time to cu^ thou sal make na
comparison betuix men, for i persaue that al men that euyr vas or euyr sal be
ar creat of ane masle of clay and eird. This exempil declaris that na man should
gloir in his nobilite or gentil blude considerand that our c^rious ande
corporal nature and carnal origyne is baytht vile ande infekkit ande there is da
defferens nor acceptions of persons betuix us. the prudent Solomon accordis
vitht this samyn purpos in the 7 chept^r of his be^k of sapiens sayand sum

O my eldest soune nobilis and gentil men, quhy vil e nocht consi^ir their

verkis testifeis that e ar bot inciuile vilainis. e vald be reput and callit
virtuous and honest qu hou be it that e did neuyr ane honest act, and e reput
vthir men for vilanis that did neuyr ane vilaine act, it aperis that quhen our
nobil predecessors decessit, thai tuke there virtue and gentreis vitht them to

the vordis of the holy man Job may be veil applyit to this samyn purpos quhe^
he said mor tui sunt nobiles, and innobiles sunt filij eoru. quod he al nobil
men ar decessit and there sonnis ande successors ar bot vilanis the vordis of
Job ar over manifest in our cuntre, for i see no thing amang gentil men bot
vice. for honestee is maculat ignorance is prisit, prudens is scornit, chestite
is banneist the nychtis ar over schort to gentil men to comnit there libedeneus
lust and the day is ar over schort to them to commit extorsions on the pure
pepil, there blasphematione of the name of god corruptis the air. The prodig
pride that ringis amang gentil men is detestabil. nocht alanerly in costly
clethyng abufe there stait bot as veil in prodig expensis that thai make on horse
and doggis abufe there rent or reches. ane man is nocht reput for ane gentil man
in scotland, bot gyf he make mair expensis on his horse and his doggis nor he
dois on his vyse and bayrnis. The poiettis feneis that the grecian dyameid head

The horse of diameid ei^ no men, bot the supers^u and prodig expensi^ that he

fort the po^ettis feneis that dyamedis horse eit men, be cause tha eit the

acteon vas nocht transformit in ane heart nor it his doggis sleu him nocht. the

po^etis feneis that his doggis distroyit him. alace there is over money horse in
scotland lyik dyam^dis horse that eitis the pure pepil, and there is over money
doggis i^ scotland that virreis th^re master as acteo vas virre it, i repreif
nocht gentil men for the halding of horse and doggis, for horse ar necessair
and doggis ar for recreatione. bot i repreif the over prodig expensis that sum

the philosophour xenophon rehersis that cirus king of perse and meid vas verray

O e my eldest soune nobilis and gentil men i exort ou to correct our selfis of

the may part of the vicis that thy tua brethir hes co^mittit, may be

alanerly in the knaulage of divine sciens bot als veil in humanite as in til
scie^s liberalis and in moral and natural philosophy the quhilk gracis and
propreteis ar nocht granti^ be god for thy particularite bot rather god hes
ordand the, to be ane dispe^satour of his gyftis amang the ignorant pepil, there
for I vald thou var solist to distribute the talent that the lord gef til his
saruand. And thou can nocht distribut it bettir nor to purches unite and
concord betuix the and thy tua brethir for the prudens and autorite that the
lord hes gyffin to the should suppreme there ignorante error and obstination There
for as lang as thou ar neneclegent in thy office sa lang sal there ay be
discentione discord and hatrent in the realm, quhilk sal be occasion of thy
auen ruuyne. T^erfor i exort the til animaduert and to perpend maturly their
vordis in dread that thou repent thy neclege^s quhen thou hes nalasar nor
oportunite to remede thy abusion. And first to begin thou should set al thy
felicite to correct thy self of thy lang abusione, that is to say thou should gyf
good exempil in thy conuersatione, c^nformand to thy professione and to thy
doctryn, to that effect that the pure pepil may follou thy futsteppis as is
vritin in Mathou Luc and Ihone, sic luceat lux vestra coram hominibus, vt
videant opera vestra bona. There for thai that hes autorite and gyfis evil
exempil, should be mair rely puneist nor the pepil should be that contennis and
disobeys there authorite. it is vritin in the brasyn tablis of the antiat lauis
of rome, that there vas mair rigorus punitione exsecutit on ane man of autorite
that gef evil exe^pil nor vas exsecutit on murdresaris and tr^tours. Romulus
the first king of rome, inst^tut ane lau amang the ytaliens that transgresours
should be puneist mercyfully effera^d for the qualite of there crymis, and alse he
statu^ that quhen men of autorite and dignite committit thai samyn crymis, tha
var led and co^uoyit dishonestly to the plane marcat before the capitol quhar
they resauit doubil punitione, be cause the evil exe^pil of there maluersatio^e
prouokyt the pepil til adhere to vice and to detest virtue. Hermes the
philosophour said, that the error and the evil exe^pil, of ane man of autorite
may be co^parit til ane on expert master of ane schip, quhilk throucht his
misgouernance is occasion that the schip pereseis, and tynis nocht him self
alanerly, bot as veil he tynis al them that are of his company. there for it var
verray necessair that men of autorite or ministers of the kyrk, to gyf good
exemp^l in there conversation to that effect that the ingnorant pepil may follou
there futsteppis. The philosophour plutarque rehersis ane exempil of the partan
quhilk repreu^t ane of her ong partans be cause the ong parta^ vald nocht gang
even furtht bot rather sche eid crukit bakuart and on syd. than the ong p^rt^n
ansuert, quod sche motber, i can nocht ga^g of my aue^ nature as thou biddis me
bot (...) theles vald thou gang furtht rycht before ^e, than i sal leyrn to
follou thy futsteppis. ^his exempil tendis rhat the discipil follo^^s the
conuersatione of his preceptor rather nor he follouis his doctrine. allace o my
sune sperualite the abusion of thy office is the cause of the discentione that
is betuix the and the temporal stait for e tua ar lyike cattis and doggis
berkka^d on vthirs there for there, is nocht ane of ou bettir nor ane vthir, for
that cause the gramariaris can find na greis of comparaiso^ in our gudnes, for
that terne bettiris of the comparatyue gree and that term good, is of the
positive gree, the quhilk positive gree, is nocht in money of ou, conformand till
ane reul of the lau. L. cum furti. ff. de con di. furti. the quhilk reul sais,

sone speritualite to correct thy maluersatione for quhen the pepil disobeyis
thy good doctrine throucht the evil exempil of thy maluersatione thou sal be
mair doubil puneist nor tha sal be for the disobedie^s of thy good doctrine, be
rason that god hes gyffin to the baytht knaulage and autorite to gouuerne there
ignorance, doutles thy abusione and the sinister ministratione of thy office is
the special cause of the scisma and of diue^s sectis that trublis al
cristianite, and qu hou be^^ that the rute of their scismes and sect^s be in
germane denmark and ingland it nochthe les the branchis of them ar spread
athortal cristin realmis in sic ane sort that tha hef may fauoraris no.
aduersaris for diverse men desiris ane part of the temporal patrimonye of the
kyrk be cause of the abusione and evil exempil of the ky^k men. And this plag
and scisma sal neuyr be reformit for na statutis, lauis punitio^s, bannessing,
byrnyng, hayrschip nor torment that can be deuisit quhil on to the time that
the speritualite reform there auen abusion. there for gyf the speritualite var
as solist to reform and to correct there aue^ maluersatione as tha ar solist to
puneise them that detrakkis and murmeris there obstinat abusione tha^ for certan
the good exempil of there good conuersatione vald extinct and supedeit mair
haistyar al peruerst opinions and scismas nor all the punitione that al
cristianite can exsecut. The punitione that the sperutualite remanent in there
abusione, exsecutis on scismatikis, may be comparit til ane man that castis
vlye on ane heyt birnand fyir in hope til extinct it and to droune it furtht,
the quhilk vlye makkis the fyir mair bold nor it vas of be for. the experiens
of this is manifest for as sune as there is ane person slane brynt or bannest
for the halding of peruest opinions incontinent there rysis up three in his
place, there for sic punitione may be co^parit till ane serpent callit hydra
quhilk head seuyn heydis, The poietis rehersis that quhen this said sepent vas

be grouuen on her as of before and of this sort sche did grit damage baytht to

straik al her seuyn heydis fra her. fra that time furtht sche lyuit neuyr
agane, this exempil tendis that the scisma that ringis in this varld sal neuyr
be extinct for na punitione that can be exsecutit bot gyf all the heydis of the
universal cristianite be strikkyn fra them orellis bot gyf the ministers

Quhar for (o my sone speritualite) exort the that thou cause al thy membris

invasions of our dissaitful and incredule ald enemeis. Thou hes mair occasion
and mystir to be vigila^d in the dessens of the liberte of thy faculte nor hes

conquessis our realm doutles thy tua brethir vil tyne there gudis and there

slauis, and renegat scottis. bot he vil nocht grant na grace to thy faculte bot
the samyn grace that king henry the eycht gave to the sperutualite of england
that is to say in the first, he tuke the patrimone and the temporal landis of
the kyrkis of england and anext ane part of the^ to the proprite of his croune
and ane vthir part he dis^r^but ama^g ane certan of grit personagis of his real

There for (o thou my sycond sone sperualite) thou may believe surly that the
king of ingland, vil be na mair gracius, curtas nor merciful to the quhome he

Quhou the affligit lady dame scotia makis ane exortatio^e til her three sonis,
quhilk is the conclusione of this beuk. Cha. XX.
O e my three sonnis i hef accusit euyrye ane of ou pericularly i^ special for
the abusione of our faculte ^is and officis. the quhilk abusione is the cause
of the co^tentione and discord that ringis amang ou, the quhilk contention and
discord hes dune mair damage in our cuntre, nor the grit army of ingland hes
dune. i vald speir ane question, quhat medicine can help ane seik man that
hurtis him selue vilfully and prouokis his auen seiknes daly? or quhat cite can
endure, quhen it is seigit and assaileit vitht out be enemeis, and vitht in the
cite ringis mortal veyr amang the gouuernours and inhabitantis? O e my three
sonis, quhat can the varld estime of ou, quhen e ar sa solist on the ruuyne or
our prospeite and on the demolitio^e of our como^t veil? our conditions and
conuersations is mair lyik til barbarien pepil nor it is to cristyn pepil, e
lament hauyly the cruel veyrs, and e cry and desyris pace at god, e heffand
rancor in our hartis co^trar our nychtbours, e desire mercy at god, e heffand
ane draue^ sourd in our hand to slay ane innocent, e vald be louit vitht al men
and e hef na cherite to n^ man Quhy should god delyuyr ou fra our enemeis? sen
that e ar mortal enemeis to our selsis, our honor is tynt sen that our
vaileantnes is changit in berkyng on vthirs lyik cattis and doggis. e hef left
the protectione of our comont salut, and e ar be cum sodiours and pensionaris
to our enemeis, and alse e ar be cu^ enemeis to our auen veilfair and
prosperity. allace vald e considir the grit ruuyne and perditio^e that hescu^
on diverse realmis throucht the discentione and diuisio^e that rang amang the
pepil, than i believe that e vald treit pace in our conscience, and cherite to
our nychtbours. the holy scriptour confermis this samyn purpos, Math. 12.
quhar crist Jesus said, Omne regnum in se diuisum desolabitur, Luce. 11.
al realmis that are deuidit vitht in them selfis be discentione and
contentione, sal be left desolat. there for (o e my three sonnis) it is na
meruel that our cuntre cum to ruuyne and desolatione, considerand that al
sortis of detestabil and onleful veyrs and battellis that distroyit the romany
in the ancia^t dais, ringis presently amang ou, throucht the discentione,
diuisione inuy rancor and auareis that ringis universally throucht al scotland.
the first sort of battellis and veyris that broucht the romani to ruuyne vas
callit battellis finityuis, Justin. Lib. 1.
A finibus, that is quhen ane man under takkis to co^ques be violence and
tirranye, the landis of his nychtbours that marchis and lyis contigue vitht his
landis, as did Ninus king of the assiriens, quha vas nocht contentit vitht his
auen cuntre, there for he maid veyr on all the cuntreis that circuit his realm.
this sammyn sort of v^yrs is in scotland for there is nocht money men, grit nor
small that hes heretage, bot is aye inuentand cauillatione and vra^g titilis to
hef there nychtbours heretagis that lyis contigue beside them, other be process
and pleyis, or ellis be violence. there vas ane vthir sort of battellis amang
the romans callit battellis socialis, that is quhen tounis of ane cu^tre makkis
veyr contrar vthirs, as of diverse tounis of germanye and ytalie. Their samyn
sort of veyrs ringis presently in scotland, for there is nocht ane boroustone
nor landuard paris vitht in the realm, bot thai hef inuy contrar the tounis
and parisis that are nixt nychtbours to them. the third sort of veyris var
callit battellis ciuilis, that is quhen citinaris and induellaris of ane cite,
hes mortal feed co^trar vthirs as vas betuix silla and marius, and quintus
lipidius. this samvn sortis of veyris ringis instantly in scotland, for there
is nocht ane borroustoune nor parise i^ scotland bot there is deidly feed amang
sum of the induellars of the saidis tounis there is ane vthir sor^ of veyris
callit battellis intestynis, that is quhen kynsmen and frendis of consanguinite
or affinite hes mortal veyr contrar vthirs, as vas betuix Julius caesar and his
good sone grit pompeus, this samyn sort of veyris ringis instantly in scotland
for the intestine veyris that ringis amang the barrons and gentil men of
scotland is detestabil to be rehersit, for thai that are nerest of kyn and
blude, hes may mortal feed contrar vthirs, quha ca^ calkil the degreis of kyn
and blude of the barro^s of scotland, thai vil conferme this samyn. there is
ane vthir sort of veyris c^llit battellis asephales, that is quhen the pepil
gadris to giddir in ane grit conuentione but the autorite of the superior, as
did the comontis of germanye quhilkis var the numer of ane hundyr thousand men,
thai did grit damage, thai obeit nocht to their dukis and superioris, tha^ the
duc of saxon and the langraue of hiss ve^quiest and distroyit them siclyik as
did the comontis of ingland the eir of 1553 eris quhilkis var distroyit under
the trettye of concord, this samyn sort of veyris ringis instantly in scotland
for i he^ seen nine or ten tho^sand gadyr to giddir vithtout any commissione of
the kyngis letteris, the quhilk grit co^uentione hes been to put there
nychtbours furtht of there steding and takkis on vytson veddy insday, or ellis

Seneca. Aut ridenda omnia, aut flenda sunt. THyr exe^plis of their tua

gif thai mittygat and mortife there detestabil pride, inuy, and auereis. i
meruel that thai considir nocht that god behaldis al there obhomination it
aperis that thai believe that god sleipis and seis the^ nocht, for there
conversation is, as there var nocht ane detht to sla there bodeis nor ane hell to
puneis there saulis. I am viuunt homines tanquam mors nulla sequatur, Et velud
infernus fabula ficta foret God seis al thing and there is nay thing ob^enre
fra him as is vrityn in Mathou Marc, and Luc. Nihil enim est tectum quod non
sit retegendum and nihil occultu^, quum futurum sit vtsciatur there for it is
grit foly^ to my three sonnis to couuer there vice vitht dissymilit virtue, for
there is nathing that is hid or sylit, bot the time sal make it manifest for
every thing is subieckit to the process of the time, and the time consumis al
thing, as it consumis the quhyt fleureis of green treis except the verite and
virtue quhilk sal neuyr consume bot rather augmentis in every time. It vas
sperit at the philosophour tales, gyf that the goddis kneu the verkis that men

exemplis should be apply it to the pepil that are dissymilit in there
conuersations, and that cullurs and couuers there false hartis vitht verkis
aperand to be verteous and faythtful. bot there isna dissymilatio^. O e my three

our hartis ar evil, and that men kennis that our verkis ar evil i exort ou chat

to the sammyn and than doutles god sal schau his mercy and sal releue ou of the

extreme ruuyne that is to say fra veyr fra pest and fra hungir. and sic good
pollice sal neuyr cum til effect quhil that e have treittit pace and concord
amang our selfis, the quhilk concord amang our selfis vil be ane mair auful

querrel contra ingland, our cronikmakkis manifest that that the inglis me^ van
neuyr na thing at our handis bot rather lossit quhen thai intendit veyr contrar

quhilk vas occasion that the barbarie^s the perfiens and mediens and the
grecians co^queist all the grit empire of Alexander and maid sklauis of his

nocht hef ane marrou in rome, and pompeus vald nocht hef ane superior the
quhilk discentione vas occasion of the civil and intestine veyrs that rang
universal in ytalie. and for that cause the romans that head dominion athort all the varld be came subject to them quhom thai head dantit of before siclyik the
triumphand cite of cartage quhilk dantit al africa, spange, and ceciland did
money vailant actis contrar the romans, it be came subject to them that it head
venqueist of before, fra time that discentione and diuisione raise amang the
nobillis of tha^ town.

Quhar for i exort ou my three sonnis that e expel discentione discord, and ald
feed that ringis amang ou, quhil the veyris be dune, and than e sal triumph
contrar our enemeis. i vald e tuke exempil of diverse nobil romans and
grecians, that head mortal feed contrar vthiris it nochtheles quhen there
enemeis assailet there native cuntre, than al their nobillis concurrit in ane
accord, and set there particular rancor and feed on side, as did the tua
vaileant consulis of rome, ane vas callit marcus emilius lepedus, the tothir
fuluius flaccus, quha head mortal heytrent and deidly feed contrar vthirs. At
that instant time Annybal conqueist cannes, at the dolorus battle quhar that
the consul emelius Paulus vas slane, quhar that Annibal gat at the spule of the
romans, three muis full of gold ringis that var on the fingaris of the romans
that var slane. Than eftir this dolorus discumfiture of the romans, diverse
citeis and castellis of Italy randrit them til Annibal, sum be forse, and sum
be trason, and in speciale the town of capes vas randrit be trason, be the
prencipal citinaris of the town Than their tua nobil consulis Marcus emilius
lepedus, and fuluius flaccus quhilkis head mortal feed betuix them, for
particular occasions, and thai persauand al there native cuntre in dangeir of
ruuyne, thai said til vthirs It is necessair that ve foret and put on side the
lange dedly feed that hes bea^ betuix us for our particular veil, for gyf
Annibal conqueis al Italy, our particular veil sal nocht be save. of this sort
their tua nobil co^sulis past in ane accord vitht xxxiij legions of men of veyr,
and conqueist vaileantly the town of capes, and sleu all the chartagien
sodiours, that annibal head left in garnison vitht in the town of capes, and
alse tha gart justify to the detht xxv of the prencipal citinaris be cause of
there trasonabil seditione committit co^trar there comont veil. There is ane
vthir exempil of the grit hatrent and mortal feed that vas betuix tua nobil
consulis of rome, ane vas callit Claudius nero, the tothir vas callit liuius
salsinator, the senate send claudius contrar Annibal vitht ane grit army, at
that instant time the post came to the senate declarand, that hasdrubal, quh^ vas
the bruther of Annibal, vas cum fra affri^a, and past throcht spange and France
and cumandour the alps of ytalie vitht ane grit army to succur his brothir
Annibal i^ hope to distroye al ytalie. for that cause the senate send liuius
salsinator contrar hasdribal. quha head nocht ane sufficient nu^mer of men. of

hostilius vytht the half of his army contrar Annibal, quha sleu xxx thousand
of Annibal men of veyr and claudius nero past vitht the tothir half of his

and alse thai tuke viij thousand presoners, and thai cuttit the head fra
hasdribal. and in there returnyng to rome thai keist the heyde before the^ on
the gait and playt vitht it vitht there feit as it head been ane futbal, fra
that time furtht Annibal tynt curage in sic ane sort that his men of veyr var
daly deffait. There is ane vthir exempil of the dedly feed and hat rent that
vas betuix Munitius master of the horse men and the consul fabius, their tua
romans head the gouernyng of ane^ grit army of romans contrar Annibal. Munitius
the master of the horse men vas verra proud in him self, and alse in his veyrs
he vas mair furius nor prudent, bot his collig fabius vas called graif and
pacient in his bissynes Munitius in his furour vald have often gyffin battle til
Annibal, bot fabius vald neuyr consent be cause he sau the aperand danger that
vas to succed throucht the subtilite of Annibal, than Munitius desirit at
fabius that he vald thole him to have the hail gouuernyng of the army ane

gouuernyng of the army his day about to the quhilk fabius vald nocht consent
sayand i will nocht thole ou til haszard all the grit army of rome in dangeir
throucht our ignorant furius consait bot i am content that the grit army be
partit in tua partis, and e to haif the half of the army, and i sal have the
tothir half i^ gouernyng tha^ e may hasard and fecht quhen that e think our
comodius time. Munitus vas verra glaid of this ansuer, on this accord thai
partit and diuidit there legions and campis in tua equal partis. this debait
and discention vas reportit til Annibal be his spyis and his exploratours,
quhilk vas til him doubil joy, ane^ cause of his joy ^as be cause he thocht
to venqueis the furius fule hardynes of munitius, even as he vald him self, the
tothir cause of his joy vas, be raison that the half of the stryntht of fabius
vas dymynischid, be cause of the parting of the tua hostis in tua partis. there
vas ane hill betuix Anniballis host and the host of munitius quhilk hill, quha
euyr head gottyn it, he should have been able to do mekil displeseir til his
enemeis, bot it Annibal desyrit it to make occasion of battle to munitus,
quhome he kneu veil that throucht his furor and fule hardines, vald gane stand
and stop him fra the takkyng of the said hill. than Annibal persauit and spyit
at the fut of the said hill qu. hair there vas diverse cauis and cauernis and
grit nolis, vitht in the rocche cragis, vitht in the quhilk he pat five
thousand fut men and horse men, nocht persauit be the romans. on the morn
Annibal send ane feu mu^nir of men to tak the forsaid hill. Munitius persaua^d
that ane feu nu^mer of chartagiens var in purpos to tak that hill, than the
romans brak there arraye to ryn to impesche the taking of the said hill, for
first Munitius send lycht harnessied ong men, and syne he send ane grit numir
of horse men contrar Anniballis men. and Annibal send syklyik fut men and horse
men to reskeu his men that he head send to the hill than Munitius in grit furor
came vitht the remanent of his army contrar the hill takkaris than Annibal seand
occasion and time oportune to gyf battle he past forduart vitht his army
contrar the romans on the tothir side all the five thousand men that var hid in
the cauis and holis of the hill ischit furtht on the bakkis of the romans vitht
money hiddeous cryis. the romans beand in this grit perplexite, beand closit
betuix tua armeis, thai be came discuragit, quhilk gart them fle fra the battle,
bot Anniballis army follouit and sleu money romans. At this instant time fabius
the collig of Munitius persauand the grit discu^sytur of the romans throucht
the misgouuernance and furor of Munitius, he said, fortou^e hes schauen her
folly na sooner nor i beleuit, Munitius throcht his fule hardines hes lossit the
half of the gryt army of rome he hes euyr been my mortal enemy and nou i have
time oportune to revenge me on him. bot at this time i will nocht thole the
comont veil to perreise for my vendicatyue particular affection^ there for i will conteneu our querrel and ald feed til ane moir oportunite than fabius
causit his men to display there baners and standardis and syne came forduart in
good arraye contrar Annibal to succur and reskeu munitius and his men that var
fled than the romans that var fast fle and persauand fabius army cu^mand to

fabius in Arraye, and rycht vaileantly thai ve^queist and sleu the may part
of Anniballis men and chaissit him self to tuscan.

O my three sonnis nobilis clergy and lauberaris, their exemplis of their nobil

for defens of there natyue cuntre. should provoke ou to foret the hatrent and

and e he^fand all the inunitions for veyr that is in europa al their thingis be
for rehersit sal be confusione to ou, rather nor supple, as lang as e have

giddir in unite for the deffens of our cuntre as did their romans befoir
rehersit and in apdosit gyf our particular feed contrar vthirs remanis in our
hartis than doutles tuenty thousand of our enemeis sal venqueis ane hundretht
thousand of ou, and thai sal put our generatione and there posterite furtht of
rememorance, and our mortal enemeis sal inhabit and ocupe our placis.

O my three sonnis, i hef often tymis rehersit of before of the trason that
occurris i^ scotland. and quhou beit that there be money trasonabil actis
manifest in scotland, it nochtheles i can nocht condescend in special on na man
that hes committit any trason, and alse i vait for certan that there is money
nobil men in scotland that are suspekkit of trason and ar sklandrit for the
samyn be the vulgar pepil quhou beit that thai be innocent of that foul crime.
the occasion of the samyn suspitione hes procedit of the subtilite of our ald
enemeis, for ane dispyt that tha have ymaginet co^trar ou, be cause that thai
dreid our vaileantnes, and for that cause thai have gart ane secret brute pas
in scotland that sum of ou hes intelligens vitht them, and to gar there inuentit
subtle cauteil contrar ou entir mair large in the vulgaris hartis, thai have
gart there borderaris make incursions and forrais far vitht in scotland quhar
thai have spuleit and reft grit multiply of mouiabil gudis, ascheip nolt, and
horse and thai have dune na damage nor hayrschipis to su^ of our stedingis and
takkis, the quhilk thing thai have dune to that effect that e may be haldin
odius and suspetius be our prince, throucht the quhilk suspitione our prince
may gar preson our bodeis, than e beand in varde or in preson, e can nothir
resist nor deffend our cuntre fra the on merciful invasions of our ald enemeis.
Quhair for it is necessair for our veilsayr that the commit sum vaileant act
contrar our enemeis, to that effect that the prince and superioris, and, alse
the comont pepil of the realm may knau our innocens.

There is ane exempil conformand to this samyn purpos in the feyrd cheptor of
the syco^d beuk of tucidides quhou that pericles of athecles and fabius before
rehersit, to that effect that the remanent of the pepil may gyf confidens to
ou, quhilk vil be occasio^e that the hail body of the realm vil haszard there
lyuis and there gudis in our company for the just defens of our comont veil
and our natyue cuntre Allace the suspetione that the pepil hes contrar sum of
ou is nocht causles for men of small experie^s may persaue that there is diverse
men of scotland, that are be cu^ neutral that is to say, thai vil nothir tak ane
plane part vitht england nor vitht scotland, for quhen their neutral men speikis
vitht inglis me^ thai lament hauyly the inco^stance of the lordis of scotland
that hes brokyn there promit and band the quhilk vas honestly co^trakkit to
compleit ane marriage betuix our nobil princes h^retour of scotland and eduard
the ong king of ingland, the quhilk contract beand fulfillit, vald hef been
the cause of ane perpetual unite betuix the tua said realmis, and quhen their
said neutral men speikis vitht scottis men that regret and lamentis hauylye the
discentione and diuisione that ringis amang the nobilis of scotland quhi^kis
occasion that the inglis men be there falsed and subtilite persecutis our
realm vitht out any just titil. Of this sort the neutral scottis men
entretenis baytht the realmis quhil on to the time that ane of the realmis
conqueis the tothir. and than thai vil adhere til his opinione that conquesis
the victore. both dissymilit and subtyl neutral men at the end of the veyrs
vil be reuardit. the cordinar of rome vas reuardit be augustus caesar as i sal
rehers. The beuk of the annals of rome rehersis, that in the time of the civil
veyris that vas betuix Augustus Caesar, and Anthonius, quhilkis tua contendit
for the empire. the judgment of the victore that vas aperand to be betuix them,
vas verray incertan to the universal pepil of ytalie, be ras^n that thai var
profond hic spretit vaileant men and verray opulent in reches and of grit
allya, quhilk vas occasion that the romans var deuidit in tua ad^erse parteis.
at that time there vas ane cordinar of rome ane verray subtle rich villane,
quha be ca^ neutral, in during the time of the veyris betuix Augustus and
Anthonius, tariad quhil on to the time that ane of them var superior of the
tothir, it he nocht beand certan quha should be superior of rome, and alse beand
desirus to have the grace and fauouris of him that hapnit to be imperiour, he
be grir subtilite neurissit tua ong corbeis in tua cagis, in tua syndry housis,
and he leyrnit them baytht to speik. he leyrnit ane of them to say, god save
thy grace nobil victoreus augustus caesar. and he leyrnit the tothir to say god
save thy grace nobil victoreus empriour anthonius, than this subtel cordinar
set ane of his corbeis that gef loving til augustus furtht at his vindo on the
plane reu, quhen he beheld any gentil men of augustus allya pas or repas before
his house. and siklyik he set furtht his tothir corbe at his vindo quhen he
beheld any of the allya of Anthonius pas or repas before his house. the quhilk
thing he did to that effect that he mycht vyn the fauoir of augustus and nocht
to tyne the fauoir of anthonius. of this sort he vas lyik to the sourd vitht
the tua edgis than quhen Augustus caesar venquest anthonius, and vas pacebil
empriour this subtel cordonar presentit the corbe til Augustus quhilk gef him
loving in her artificial speech, of the quhilk caesar vasverray glaid, quhar for
he gef to the cordonar fyftene hundretht pieces of gold, bot sune there eftir it
vas reportit to augustus caesar, that the said subtel cordonar head ane corbe
that gave as grit loving til anthonius, than augustus causit the said corbe and
the cordonar to be brotht in his presens and quhen he persauit that the
cordonar vas ane astuce subtel falou and dissymilit, he gart hang him on ane
potent before the capitol and his tua corbeis be side him.

Of this sort (O e my three sonnis) any of ou that is be cu^ neutral to scotland
and ingland and is tariand quhil there be ane prince superior to baytht the
realmis, doutles e sal be recompensit be that prince for our as^uce
dissymilitnes as the cordinar vas recompensit be augustus caesar. There for i
exort ou to revoke our neutralite and that e be cum special vaileant
deffendours of our natyue cuntre. it vas sperit at cicero in the time of the
civil veyris betuix Julius Caesar and pompeus quhais querrel and part that he
vald tak. cicero ansuerit, quem fugiam scio, quem sequar nescio, this is to say
i vait quhais part i sal refuse, bot, vait nocht quhais part i sal tak. this
ansueir of ambiguite declarit that cicero vas be cum neutral in the civil and
intestine veyris, that vas betuix julius Caesar and grit pompeus, it nochtheles
the romans murmerit h^s ansueir of ambiguite to the vrang part allegea^d that
he head mair fauoir to p^^peus querrel nor to Julius Caesar bot it is the nature
of inciuil comont pepil to judge euirye purpos to the vrang face. Ane
propositione or ane respo^ce of ambiguite should be ay interpreit and exponit to
the best sens conformand til ane reul of the lau de vsu L creditor, cum ibi no
C and L si vsuras. the quhilkis cheptours sais. Ambigua solutio pro meliori and
certiori part est interpretanda et intellige^da. bot nou to proceid in my
purpose Cicero head ane honest cause to refuse h^ytht there querellis and to be
neutral be rason that thai conten in baytht to be superiors and kyngis of
rome, quh kvas express contrar the antiant lauis of the ro^^ns The sophist
logicinaris per chance may argon that tua contrareis can nocht be baytht (...)
and be this mutul at freuole reul of leg^e^i^ i vald infer and allegie that
Julius and po^peus culd nocht baytht hef ane vrangus titil i^ there debait
consider and that the comont proverb sais that in euyrie tu^ contrar opinions
there is ane rycht and ane vrang their freuole sophistari^s that marthirs and
sklandirs the text of aristotel deseruis punitione for quhou beit that there be
comparison of greis in euyrie thing, that follouis nocht that the positive gre
and the co^paratiue gre ar contrar till vthir, for good and bettir or desserent
in greis and it thai ar nocht contrar til vthirs siklyik evil and var ar of
defferent greis bot it thai ar nocht contrar til vthirs. it nochtheles there is
tua reulis in the lau that sais. Aliquid est iustum cuius contrarium est
iustius. L. exigendi C. de procu, per glo. the tothir reul sais. Aliquid est
malu^cuius contrarium est deterius. ff. de re in L. quotiens bot their tua
reulis of the lau makkis no just tittil nothir to julius nor to pompeus quhou
^e it that there querrellis var baytht co^trar til vthirs considerand that
baytht there querellis tendit to the demolitione of the antiant public veil of
the romans there for there vas na greis of comparison in there debait there for
nocht ane of them head ane just titil in th^r contrate querellis nor it the
opinion of Julius vas na var nor the querrel of pompeus co^sidera^d that the^
contraire debait var baytht of ane evil equal qualite. Nou to make ane end of
this degressione i will conclude that the neutralite of cicero deseruis
reco^me^datione quhe^ Julius and pompeus contendit quhilk of the^ should be
kyngis of rome. Bot it is nocht siclyik betuix ingland and scotland. for quhou
be in that forane princis that are indesserent til england and scotland and alse
there subiectis vil remane neutral in our veyris co^trar inglis men that
follouis nocht that scottis men can hef any just titil to remane neutral quhen
our ^^tre is inuadit be our dissaitful ald enemeis.

Quhar for i exort ou (o e my thresonnis) that gyf any of ou be suspekkit that
e hef been neutral in tymis by past that nou e purge ou vitht sum vaileantnes
contrar our enemeis, to that effect that e may revenge the extreme violent
damage that e hef sustenit be the oniust veyris of ingland. And quhou be it
that our ald enemeis vald decist fra there oniust veyris and that thai vald
treit pace vitht ou it nochtheles e should nocht condescend to sic pace, bot gyf
the king of england vald restoir ande reform the damage and violence that e
have indurit. And alse doutles the inglis men vil offir ou no pace, bot ane
dissymilit pace for there auen auantage ande to disaue ou eftiruart be ane mair
cruel veyr it is knauen throucht al cristianite that inglis men socht neuyr
pace at scotland and France at ane instant time bot rather quhen thai socht
pace at scotland there purpos vas to make veyr on France and quhen thai socht
pace of France, there purpos vas to make veyr on scotland there for sic dissimilit
pace fra the quhilk may succeid veyr, susd nocht be resauit bot rather veyris
should be maid, in hope that sure pace may succeid conformand til ane cheptour
in the xxiij distinctione in the first question quhilk sais. Non pax queritur
vt bell um excerceatur, sed bellum geritur vt pax acquiratur. there for quhen the
legatis of england offris to ou ane dishonest pace fra the quhilk may succeid
ane mair cruel veyr, e should refuse it, conforma^d to the vordis of Cicero in
his inuectyue philipiques co^thar anthonius, Philip. 12.
saya^d pax est repudianda, si sub eius nomine latitet bellum. There for (o e
my three sunnis) e have ane just titil, to refuse pace and til intend cruel veyr
contrar our enemeis. for as tucidides sais in the thretten cheptour of his
first beuk, quod he, Tucidides Libro. 1.
as it is convenient till honest and prudentmento live in pace, quhen there
nychtbours dois them na oultraige nor violence: Siklyike it is honest and
convenient, to verteous men to change there pace and rest in cruel veyr fra
time that thai have resauit oultrage and violence fra there nychtbours. for the
changeyng of ane dissymilit pace, in ane cruel veyr salbe occasion of ane
ferme and saythtful pace. Cicero co^fermis this sammyn purpose in the first
beuk of his officis. Cice. offi.
Suscipienda bella sunt, vt in pace sine iniuria v^uatur. Ande quhou be it that
there is diverse parsons in scotland that sais, that rest and pace var verray
necess^ir for us. i confess that honest pa^e should preffer on just veyris. for
that cause the empriour traian said, that it var les skaytht to make ane iu^t
veyr nor to live in dreddour under ane dissymilit pace. Tucididos li. 2. ca. 9.
Every man is oblist to deffend the gudis heretagis and possessions that his
antecestres and forbearis hes left to the^. for a^ tucidides hes said in his
sycond beuk. quod he it is ma^r dishonor till ane person, to tyne the thing,
that his antecestres and forbearis hes conqueist be grite laubours, nor it is
dishonor quhe^ he faileis in the conquessing of ane thing that he intendit till
have conquesit fra his mortal enemy. Be this rason, euyrie nobil man should be
verray solist to deffend his just querrel, for siklyik as ane man offendis his
conscience quhen he dois violence extorsions and damage till his nychtbour siklyik
ane honest man offendis and hurtis his conscience, quhen he deffendis him nocht
in his just querrel contrar his enemeis and alse reuengis him nocht of the
violence and damage that his enemeis hes perpetrat co^trar him. Quhar for i
exort ou my three sonnis, that e condescend in ane faithful accord, tha^ doutles
god sal releue on of the grit afflictione that e have indurit be the incredule
seid of ingland, and alse i believe that he sal make ou ane instrament til
extinct that false generatione furtht of rememorance, and sa fair veil.
