A compendyous treatise of sclau^dre / declarynge what sclaundre is / and what
it sygnifyeth / and how many kinds of sclaundre there be.

Woe be unto him by whom sclaundre comes. Matthew. xviii. Beware therefore what
thou spekest / of whom and by who^ / that it be not for evil will or malice /
lest thou be in dau^gre of judgment.

SClaundre is or synifieeh an offense / whereby man's mind is sore disquietid or
trobled: that is to say / it is other discouraged or couraged to or from the
imitacyon or following of a thing. ii. manner of sclau^dres. one phariscycall /
another called sclau^dre taken.
leaf; There is a double kind of sclau^dre / one is pharisaycall / which
comenly they call sclaundre taken: and that is when that ypocrytes be offended
other with right doctrine / or with necessary doing / and thereupon comes
hatred of the gospel and of godly men: as the pharisyes hated the gospel and
the teachers of the same / and pretended great causes of their grefe and hatered
taken of man's Mat. xv
wit and reason: for what man endued but with a mean wit would not be grieved
/ that the facyon of relygion should any thing decay / that comen peace should
be disquyeted / that sysmes should rise in the church / that hye powers and
commen welthes should be brought to naught. They saw that their relygion and
manner of worshipping of god was little esteemed and that the commonwealth was
hyndred / and the auctoritye of superyoures contempned: But although these be
great causes / which worthily does move men / yet it is mete to know / that
before these causes yea / before all things / that the commandment of god be
prefarred after this rule: It is necessary rather to obey God than men. Actu.
v.
Therefore this pharisaycall sclaunder or offense is not to be eschewed / for
the commandment of god excuses us. But it is necessary ye doctrine be true
certain and profitable to the church. For it is a very grievous syn to troble
the church with evil / uncertain or unprofitable disputacions.

leaf; There is another kind of sclau^dre / which they call sclau^dre given.
Sclaundre given
And it is ungodly doctrine or evil example which hurts / other because they
follow it / or because it scarreth men from the gospel. All wicked doctrynes
ar sclaundres and offenses of this kind. Also idolatrers worshippynge and men's
inuencyons / which can not be observed and kept without sin: as worshippyng
of images / going on pylgrymages / purchasyng of popysshe pardons for remissyon
of sins. Christ threat the auctors of these sclaunders chefely.

leaf; Woe be to the men by whom sclaundre comes. Mathei. xviii.
and ce. Than these sclaundres and offenses with great dilygence must be
eschewed / lest we be other auctours or alowers of ungodly doctrine and
folowers of such wicked worshippyng. etc.

A rule of the use of lybertye.
leaf; There is also another kind of sclaundre to be eschewed / that is / wha^
that a work which is indyfferent / is done out of time: as the untimely use of
christyan lyberte. Of this lyberte / there is often dysputacyons and reasonyng
/ when it is lawful / and when it is not lawful. It is sin to break men's
tradicyons / in case that the brekyng of them should be occasyon of sclau^dre
or offense to any man. Therefore the rule of Poule is to be holde^ as touching
the use of lyberte. Romans xv
Poul commands the learned men to bear thinfyrmyte of the unlearned and weke /
and follow their minds / and certify them for their good and for their
edifyeng that is / that through their gentylnes they may courage them to the
Gospel and not skarte them: For not alonly ipocryts and the ungodly sort /
but also godly men / and men of sobre living / specially they that be not
taught nor suffyciently instruct when they se ancient customs broken / they
judge by that manner of doctrine / men to be given to a wild lyberte / and
become all ungodly and so be skarred from the knowledge of the gospel.
Therefore lybertye is not to be used before them which have not yet herd this
manner of doctrine / as a fore / men not yet suffycyently confyrmed / but the^
ample of saint Poule is to be followed: I have been weke to them that are weke:
i. Corin. viii.
If my meat does offend my brother / I will never eat flesh / lest I
offend my brother. But now where as the gospel is clearly preached / and the
church meanly confirmed in the same / the grievous obseruacyon of unprofitable
tradicyons is not greatly to be required. yea / Poul for to show example of
lyberte / he would not syrcumcyse Tyte. Gala. ii.
And Christ excused his Apostles / brekyng the tradicyons of the fathers / and
says: Mathei. xxb.
Let them alone / they be blind / and gydes of the blind. etce. Mat. xb xx.iii.
But yet in this thing it is good to use sobrenesse and dyscrecyon / for even
among enemies there be some that rather should be reconsyled than styred and
provoked / and it becomes christen men to refarre all their doings not to
their own affectyons and lusts / but unto the profit of other / and to the
glory of Christ. Apoc. v.
But many there be that break ancient customs / not to profit or do service
to other / or to do better things / but because this lyberte delyteth the^.
This is a wicked thing to dyspyce ancient customs and laws / it is no
christyan thing Furthermore / the brekynge of comen customs / redily stores
up great uproar / and co^mocio^s ought not rasshely to be excyted: for it is an
hard thing afterward to have conscience that thou have given occasyon of
comen calamytes and myseres

The second rule
The second rule. Also in churches ryghtly instruct / there is to be had a
consyderacyo^ of sclaundre / lest our example do hurt other / as these be:
Often times not to force of the comen customs / and to show any contempt / and
to cause other to be forceles / or to give occasyon to dyssencyons / sysmes /
sects or factions without necessary cause. If any man after this manner breketh
tradicyons / certainly he does sin. Without such occasyon of sclaundres / we
vndrestande tradicyons to be free. This moderacyon and equytye in tradicyons is
very good to hold / for it keeps the auctoryte of tradicyons and conserueth
the comen customs and good order / and it delyuereth men's conscyences from
that old tyranny / when that they know that tradicyons be outward things and
indyfferent / and may be omytted and left without syn except it be in case of
sclau^dre.

Sclaundre of doctrine.
Furthermore / the sclaundres and offenses of doctrynes / be much worse than
evil examples i^ manners. Therefore with great dilygence / a man must be ware /
first that he teache no ungodly things / uncertain or unprofitable.
Furthermore when ye teach true things / that ye set them not forth so
confusely and doutefully / that the herers conceive any evil opinyons in such
confused and doutfull doctrine: as we se how much it profyteth the people to
be monysshed after what manner men's tradicyons may be reproved: and again for
what purpose / and to what use traditions ought to be kept and loved. Except
these things be aptly and discretly expressed / they that be unlearned conceive
a contempt of al laws and customs. Thus also in other artycles / except
they be aptly and clearly expressed / there rise opinyons very perylous.

When that men be justified by faith / how detestable opynyons does there rise
/ except the herers be monysshed what thing is entreated of / and that the
person is reconcyled by faith / and after that / our obedyence is necessary /
and in men reconcyled / is ryghtousnesse. Romans v.
Like wise of free will / that god is not the cause of evil / and many other
things / that deseruynge is not taken from works / because we can do no
thing that can deserve out of god / but because the promise of god is our
forgyuenes / that the remissyon of sin may be certain. Fre^yll
Ephe. ii.
Actus. ii
More over in men reconcyled / good works be also merytoryous. ^^ot. x.
So in all places dilygence must be given / that without sofestry or craft /
they be expressed aptly and distynctly Therefore would Paul that a bishop
should be apt to teache that he should teache aptely and distynctly. Titua. i
And Christ would that a learned man / instruct in the kingdom of god / should
belyke unto a good father of household / which in his techi^g can use discrecyon
in vttryng both new things and old. For except prechers use this diserecyon
and dilygence / many men's conscyences be sore trobled / and evil opinyons rise
in their minds / which will hurt religyon and manners / and than spring
vprores and many other matters of sclaundre and offense. Therefore let us beware
and do our dilygence that our manners beutyfye the gospel. Moreover also /
that the way of prechyng and playnesse of the same may conforte men's
conscyences / ryd them of all doutes / and redress their erroures.

Amen.
