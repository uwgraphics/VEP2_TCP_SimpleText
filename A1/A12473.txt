TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, THOMAS, Lord COVENTRY of ALESBOROVGH, Lord KEEPER of
the Great Seal of England, and one of his Majesty's most honorable Privy
Council, etc. And to his Right Honorable and Noble Lady, ELIZABETH, etc. Lady
COVENTRY, all happiness.
Right Honorable:
AS there is nothing which does more beautify and adorn this great admirable
frame of Heaven and Earth, then the wonderful variety of those rarities,
created in and about the same, in so many subiiects of diverse kinds of things,
whereof they subsist. So amongst those varieties, nothing is so wonderful as
the several gifts proceeding from that. All-quickening Spirit of God: which as
at first, It moved upon the waters, cherishing, upholding, and quickening that
rude, undigested great formelesse lump, until by Divine power, it had
animated that, and all things therein contained, setting them in their most
beautiful forms; breathing, as natural life in man, so, at length a more
abounding spiritual life, which should vent and diffuse it self in so many
thousand several gifts and excellencies, as (in a manner) there are several
Christians: especially in the Ministers of the Word: whose lips, as they
preserve knowledge, so have they their several abilities, some to cast down,
raise up, entreat, persuade, convince, instruct, threaten, insinuate, reform,
illustrate, explain, open, divide, and conueigh truths to the several
capacities of their hearers. In which the Author of this Book (a man well
known to your Honors) being so excellently sometime adorned with a compound of
these and many more gifts, (in most whereof he excelled) that the memory of so
pious, painful, and learned a man of God might not be forgotten, I adventured
to shroud this book under your Honors wings of protection, to receive some
luster and countenance by your favor, clearing the obscurity thereof, in place
of the curious hand of the most worthy Author now dead: who as he was, and his
Name and Fame (I hope) yet is and ever will be precious in your sight; So I
hope the Relation he sometime had with some of yours, and estimation from you,
would purchase me easily a pardon for this intruding boldness, whereby I have
assayed to declare my self ever,

Your Honors in all humble duty bound, I. HEART.

To the Reader.
I Know not what Apology to make for my self, that now in the copious
multiplicity of Treatises of this nature, I should yet thrust forth more, as
though I could be a poor means to bring unto thee any new matter, which by
some former Worthy had not been said before. And surely, this had almost
discouraged me, until I called to mind the speech and counsel of a Right
Reverend Father of the Church, (yet alive) which was, That if a thousand
several men had all written on these several subjects: yet he could wish them
all Printed. For (said he) though all do agree in the maine, yet should we see
a different carriage of elegancy and variety of the same spirit in the diverse
distributions, amplifications, and prosecutions of the same subject; Whereby
(at least) this profit would come, that the soul might now and then be
ravished in the admiration of the rarities of that Wonder-working-spirit, which
so diffuseth it self in choice of excellent abilities (all exquisite and
diverse) among such multitudes of several men. This with the delight I took in
reading, trimming and writing them out (with very much ado) together with the
desire I had to do some poor service to the Church, and perpetuate the memory
of the All-deseruing, most worthy, and learned Author (sometime my dear
friend) imboldened me to venture them unto thy view: at the request of his
sometime dear Wife and Executrix. I beseech thee therefore, favorably, to
censure what is done, accepting the same in good part, from him who chused
rather to present thee with a few Crummes which fell from this Holy man's
Preaching: then altogether bury in silence with him, his Words and Works. True
it is, he wrote an infinite, intricate exceeding small abreuiated hand: out of
all hope and possibility to be read (a fault yet incident to too many good
Preachers, whereby they rob Posterity of their Labors) by reason whereof,
these three Treatises (mangled as they are) were, with much ado, by a painful
Writer, and other helps, fetched (as it were) out of the fire, and so brought
to this imperfect perfection. The former two by him were never intended for the
public view: only that of Repentance, with his own Epistle, he had appointed
for the Press, at our earnest entreaty, but left it unfinished to his mind.
Therefore if therein thou find any thing pleasing for thy good: and so can
measure Exvngue Leonem: judge, if the Echo of his voice, the traces of his
footsteps, be such in scattered imperfect Notes; what were those sweet and
Excellent Strains of Learning and Piety, wherewith he was most Plentifully
endowed, and wherewith this Book had been more abundantly stored if his exact
curious hand had limned it out for this use. Much more I might say of him, but
why should I? seeing it were but to extenuate the worth of such a shining and a
burning Lamp, by laboring to express, that which was inexpressible, and
which my ignorance was never able to reach or search into. Only my request
unto thee now is, to forgive my weakness, and those mangling mistakings,
which (by my ignorance and want of judgment to dispos^ aright) are found
therein: assuring thy self I meant well, though I could not reach the Altitude
of the Author as I wished; nor amplify his breuities (as not daring to meddle
with Apelles unfinished Picture:) which great favor shall bind me yet further
to aim at thy good: remaining in the mean time,

Thy servant in Christ Jesus, I. HEART.

The end of the Table.
SMITHS GROUNDS of Religion.
Question. WHy was man made?

Answer. To serve God, Pro. 16. 4. Acts 17. 27.

Q What gather we of this?

A. That our first, and chiefest care must be to serve God, Math. 6. 33. Pro.
4. 7.

Q. Whom does this Doctrine mere withal?

A. First with those that think it enough to live ciuilly and honestly in the
world, having no love to Religion no care of serving God.

Secondly, it meets with those; who though they have some care of it; yet
make it not their first and chiefest care, but let every worldly business take
place before it.

Q. How do we know there is a God? God.


A. First, by the Scriptures. Secondly by the light of Reason.

Q. What be the reasons?

A. The first is drawn from the Works of God: The second is taken from the
Testimony of our own Conscience.

Q. What is the first?

A. When we see a fair and a goodly Tower, though we saw not the workman when
he built it, yet we easily conceive that there was some Architect that framed
it, and set it up; So when we see the glorious frame of Heaven, and Earth, we
easily conceive, that there is a God who made it, though we see him not.

Q What is the second?

A. When as a man has committed any horrible fact as murder, theft,
blasphemy, and the like; Though he hide it from men, yet he feels (then
especially when he is wakened up with some judgment) continual gripings and
gnawings, and fearful terrors in his heart, which is nothing else, but a
secret guiltiness, and a close feeling, that there is a God, who will revenge
it.

Q What is God?

A. God is a Spirit, or a spiritual substance, having his being of himself,
John 4. 24.

Q. What gather we of this that God is a Spirit?

A. That they that conceive God to be like an old man sitting in heaven,
worship an horrible Idol in stead of the true God, Luke 24. 39. Numbers 23. 19.

Q. What say you then of p^turing God in glass windows to worship?

A. It is one of the abominations in Popery, electely condemned by the Lord
Deuteronomy. 4. 14. 19. Romans 1. 23.

Q. Why is God said to have his Being of himself?

A. Because all that we have, we have from God, but whatsoever God has, he
has of none, but of himself alone, Heb 1. 3.

Q. How are we to conceive of God?

A. By his properties, That God is a Divine power. First most Mighty. Secondly
most Wise. Thirdly most Iush. Fourthly most Merciful, And fifthly Infinite.

Q Wherein appears the g^eas might and power of God?

A. First in making the world of nothing, all the world being not able to make
one^^lly fly. Secondly, in upholding it now 5622. years; Whereas Iron houses
that men make will moulder away (...) ^any less.

Thirdly, in converting the soul of a sinner, it being a harder matter, then
to make the world: For in creating the world, the Lord found no resistance,
nothing that stood up against him to hinder his work, but in converting the
soul of a sinner the Lord finds a resistance, ^en laboring to hinder his
work in them, and opposing themselves against it, Ephesians 1. 19.

Q What use may we make of this Property?

A. First, that seeing we be glad to get the favor of mighty men, we be
more careful to get the Lords favor, who is mightier, then they all, Psalm.
20. 7.

Secondly, that we faint not in any trouble seeing God is most mighty that
takes our part; For no man is so poor, but God by his power can make him rich;
No man is so sick, but God by his power can make him whole: No man is so
weak, but God by his power can make him strong, Heb 13. 6.

Thirdly, that we fear to displease him, who is able to do us more ha^^e,
then all the men in all the world can do, Luke 12. 5.

Q What is the second Property of God?

A He is most Wise.

Q Wherein appears the Wisdom of God?

A. In two things principally. First, In framing the world so wisely; that men
and Angels may wonder at it: If the Sun had been set lower, it would have
burnt us; if higher, the beams of it with such comfort would not have reached
unto us. If all had bin Summer, hea^e would have parched us. If all had been
Winter cold would have killed us. If all had been Day, many a ^^ser would have
killed up himself, and his servants and his cattle with too much working,
many an angry man would have killed himself with Fretting.

Secondly, In ordering the things of this world with such most excellent
wisdom surpassing all admiration. For somethings we may buy, as Meat,
Drink, and clothes; And somethings again we cannot buy, when we have
meat, we cannot buy a good stomach to our meat; When we have Corn, we
cannot buy seasonable weather to soweour corn, most wisely God has laid up
some part of every blessing with himself, and retained it, as it were in his
own hand, that men might be driven thereby more often to resort unto him. For
if men might have all things here below; They would never go so far as
Heaven to fetch any thing thence.

Q. What use may we make of this Property?

A. To rest contented with that portion, that God gives us, with that weather,
which God sends us, with those losses, and troubles, that God brings upon us.
God is wiser then the wisest of us, and therefore knows always what is
fittest for us, And therefore to think, when God sends us sickness, that
health were better; when God takes away our children, it were better to have
them still; It is the folly of our hearts to make our selves wiser then God.

Q. What is the third Property of God?

A. He is most Just.

Q. Wherein appears the Justice of God?

A. In blessing the godly, and punishing the wicked.

Q. How stands it then with Justice, that the godly are commonly in worst state?

A. Very well, for though they have but little, yet they have more contentment,
and more joy in that little, then the wicked have in all their plenty, Psalm.
37. 16.

Secondly, though they have but little, yet God gives them a true, and an holy
use of it: they spend, and use that little well, Esaias 23. 18.

Thirdly, that little they have is a pledge and a pawn, that God has greater
things reserved for them: As a man is put in possession of the whole field by
receiving a little Tur^e in his hand, Prou. 13. 9.

Fourthly, that they want outwardly, they have inwardly, Psalm 45. 13. Though
they be not rich in the purse, yet they are rich in Faith, James 2. 5. Though
they have not gold, yet they have that which is better then gold, Job 28. 15.
16. 1. Pet. 1. 7.

Fifthly, that which God is behind with them in this world, shall be paid them
with vantage in the world to come, Mat. 19. 28.

Q. What use may we make of this Property?

A. That seeing all our sins were punished in Christ, they cannot in justice
be punished in our selves again eternally, and therefore all they stand fully
discharged before the Judgment seat of God, who by a true and a lively faith
have received Christ. For as when the Surety has answered the debt, it cannot
in any right be demanded of the debtor again: So seeing Christ has discharged
for our sins, we ought not in any equity to be charged with them, Esaias 53. 5.

Q. Why then are the godly punished when they sin?

A. They are punished not in Judgment, but in Mercy to weaken the strength of
sin, and to keep under the rebellion of their nature, which still dwells
in them, Psalm. 119. 71.

Q. What may we further learn from this Property?

A. That God will right wrongs of his children, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 6. 7. And that the
wicked have good cause to hang down their heads, knowing that God in Justice
for every sin will be avenged of them; they must pay full sweetly for every
oath they swear, for every lie they tell, for every Sabbath they mispend, and
therefore with trembling hearts they may look every hour when the fire will
fall from Heaven, that shall burn them, when the great Judge shall appear in
the clouds, who will condemn them, Prou. 11. 21.

Q What is the fourth Property of God?

A. He is most Merciful.

Q. Wherein appears the mercy of God?

A. First in making us Men, when he might have made us Beasts; In making us
wise, when he might have made us stark fools; In giving us limbs, when he
might have made us lame; In giving us sight, when he might have made us blind?

Scondly, in providing things needful for us. When we are sick, herbs to
heal us: when we are cold, fire to warm us: when we are hungry, meat to
feed us: when we are naked, wool to cloathe us. And the more to commend his
Mercies, he prouides us of all thesethings, when we are his greatest enemies.
No man will do so much for his friend, as God does for his foes. We came into
the world with never a penny in our Purse, with never a sheare in our Barnes,
with never a sheep in our folds, with never a Coat on our back, and yet the
Lord has filled our lives with great abundance.

Thirdly, in sparing of our (...), and that diversely. First, in hiding many of
our sins from the eyes of the world: For if the world knew as much by us as
God knows, the best man that lives would blush to show his face.

Secondly, in giving us a time to repent; for if God should damn every sinner
so soon as he sins against him, woeful were our case, for none would be
saved: it is Gods mercy, that we live and breathe upon the Earth, being
guilty of so many rebellious mutinies, and treasons against our heavenly King,
as Ieremtah says, Lament. 3. 22.

Thirdly, in using all means to draw us to repentance like one that would
gladly undo a door; he tries key after key, till he has tried every key in
his bunch. So God has tried by Mercy, and tried by Judgment; he has tried by
poverty, and tried by plenty, because he would gladly by some means bring us
to him, Esaias 5. 4. As when a great fish is caught upon the hook, the fish
pulls and the man pulls, and the fish pulls again. So God and the sinful
soul lie wresting together, the soul draws to Hell, and God pulls to Heaven,
so f^ine God would have us, who care too little to be saved of him.

Q. What use may we make of this Property?

A. First, that men have good cause to love God, seeing he does more for them
then the dearest friend in the world will do; If we should iniure your friend
but half so much, as we iniure God, he would sooue cast us off, Psalm. 27. 10.

Secondly, they do the Lord of Heaven great wrong who pray to the Virgin Mary,
or to any of the Saints, as if they were more favorably inclined to Mercy
then the Lord, Psalm. 50. 15.

Q. What is the last Property of God?

A. He is Infinite.

Wherein appears the infiniteness of God?

A. In two things First, in respect of Time. Secondly, in respect of Place.


In respect of Time; because he is everlasting without beginning, and without
end, beyond all time, Esaias 51. 5.

In respect of place; because he fills all places with his presence, Psalm
139. 7. 8.

Qu What use do we make of this Property?

A. First, to walk with fear and reverence all our days, because God is an
eyewitness of all we do, or say, and therefore we ought to walk with as
great shamefacednesse, and bashfulnesse before him, as before the greatest
Prince or power in the world, Prou. 15. 11.

Secondly, not to be dismayed in any trouble, because God is ever at hand to
take our part; As a child will not care for the servants, so long as he is in
his fathers presence, Psalm. 23. 4.

Thirdly, that the divine Nature ought rather with reverence to be adored, then
curiously to be searched, for seeing God is infinite in all his nature; so
mighty that none can conceive how mighty he is, so wise that all the wits in
the world cannot tell how wise he is; We are no moreable to comprehend his
excellent Nature, then we are to graspe the Mountains in our arms, or to
span the broadest of the Sea with our fingers, 1. Tim. 6. 16.

Qu. How many persons be there in the Godhead? Godhead.


A. Three, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.

Qu. Is it needful for us to know the distinction of the Persons?

A. Very needful, for the Turks and the Jews confess one God, but because
they deny the distinction of the Persons, they neither acknowledge the Son
of God their Redeemer, nor the holy Ghost their Sanctifier.

Secondly, the Majesty of God is unsearchable, and cannot be apprehended, but
as it comes forth, and reueales it self in the Person of the Son, and
therefore they that know not the Son of God, they in very deed know not God,
John. 1. 18. 1. Ioh. 2. 23.

Qu. What is the Father?

A. The Father is that Person in the Godhead, who begets the Son, Psalm. 2.
7.

Qu. What is the Son?

A. The Son is that person, who is begotten of the Father, John 1. 14.

Qu. What is the Holy Ghost?

A. The Holy Ghost is that Person, who proceeds from them, both from the
Father and the Son, John 15. 26. Gal. 4. 6.

Qu. Was not the Father before the Son?

A. The Son is everlasting as well as the Father, for the Son is the
Wisdom of the Father, and therefore as we cannot say, there was any time when
God was without wisdom: So we cannot say there was any time, when God was
without a Son, Pro. 8. 23.

Qu. Are there not three Gods as there are three Persons?

A. No, for all the three Persons, are but one and the selfsame God; so that
as the Root, and the Body, and branches of a tree, are all but one tree; So the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are all but one God, and therefore they
that conceive, the three Persons to be so distinct, as threemen are; they
entertain a false conceit of the living God, Cor. 8. 4.

Qu. What use may we make of this?

A. That whosoever worshippeth one of the divine Persons, worshippeth them all,
because they are all but one and the selfsame God; And therefore men may not
think when they pray to one of the divine Persons, the other is passed by, but
he that honors one, honors all, and he that prays to one, prays to
all, John 5. 23.

Qu. How must we serve God?

A. According to his Word, not after our fancies, but as God himself will be
served, Deuteronomy. 12. 32.

Qu. What gather we of this?

A. That all will worship brought in by men without warrant of the Word of God,
is to be condemned, Mark. 17. 17.

Qu. What is the word of God?

A. That which is contained in the holy Scriptures in the Books of the old and
new Testament, there God speaks unto Word of God.
us, and breaks his mind familiarly, how and in what sort he will be served
of us, 2. Tim. 3. 16.

Qu. What use may we make of this?

A. To remember, that as often as the Bible appears, the blessed mouth of God
is open to instruct us, and that they which regard not the Scriptures, regard
not the voice of God, and they that suffer the Bible to lie clasped and shut in
their houses, do as it were seal up the mouth of God that he may not speak
unto them.

Qu. How know we that the Scriptures are the word of God?

A. By the power of them, for God alone is able to convert the soul of a
sinner, and to beget faith, and therefore seeing the preaching of the
Scriptures has begotten faith in us. and converted us unto God, we must
needs confess, even from our own feeling, that the Scriptures are the very
arm and power of God.

Qu. Why are they termed the old and new Testament?

A. Because as a man by his Will and Testament disposes those lands and goods
which he has: So God in the Scriptures, has bequeathed many blessings, as it
were a number of legacies to the sons of men.

Qu. What did God bequeath in the Old Testament?

A. Salvation and eternal Peace to those that fulfill the Law; Misery and
hell, and eternal death to those that break the Law, Deuteronomy. 28. 15.

Qu. What did God bequeath in the New Testament?

A. Salvation and eternal Peace to those that believe in Christ, and
contrariwise; Condemnation and Eternal death to those that believe not in him:
By the Old Testament none inherit, but those that fulfill the Law. By the New
Testament, all those inherit, who believe in Christ, Mark. 16. 16.

Qu. Are all the Books in the Bible to be received alike?

A. No, for the Apocryphal, are no further to be received, then they consent
with the Canonical books, or with sound reason.

Qu. What Books are Canonical?

A. All in the New Testament, and so many in the Old as were written by Moses,
or any of the Prophets, so that all are Canonical from Genesis to Malachy who
was the last Prophet.

Qu. Why are they called Canonical?

A. Because they are the rule to direct our faith, and our life; for Canon in
Greek signifies a Rule, or a square, which a Mason, or a Carpenter uses for
his direction in his work; So that as they work all by Rule and line; so we
must square out both our Faith and our life by these holy Books.

Q. What Books are Apocryphal?

A. All in the Old Testament, that were written after the time of the Prophets,
as the first of Esdras, and the second of Tobith, Iudeth, Wisdom,
Ecclesiasticus, or Jesus Sirach, certain pieces of Esther, and Daniel, with
the Prayer of Manasses, the 1. of Maccabeus, and the second.

Q. Why are not these Canonical as well as the rest.

A. Because they were not written by Moses, or the Prophets, who were the
penne-men of the Holy Ghost, but by other godly men, who having not so great a
measure of the Spirit, could not write all things so heavenly, and so purely as
the Prophets did.

Q. Why are they called Apocryphal?

A. Because they come not forth with public authority from God, but crept in
closely, and by stelth into the Church: for Apocryphal in Greek signifies a
thing lurking in a hole or a corner, to show that these Books are not nobly
borne; And therefore howsoever they may be profitable, yet they ought not to
speak with equal authority in the congregation of the Lord, Deuteronomy. 23. 2.

Q. Had we not need of good warrant to strike off so many Books from the
Canon?

A. So we have Christ himself, who interpreting all the Scriptures,
interpreted no more but Moses and the Prophets. And therefore seeing these
Books of Tobith, Iudeth and the rest, belong neither to Moses, nor the
Prophets, as being written after their time. It is manifest that our Savior
Christ, has shut them out from the Canon of the Scriptures, Luke 24. 27.

Q. What is the drift and scope of all the Scriptures?

A. To teach us how to be saved, and to chalk out the way that leads unto
true happiness, and eternal life, 2. Tim. 3. 15. Scriptures.
John 20. 31.

Q. How may a man be saved?

A. There are three things required of him that will be saved. First, he must
know and be persuaded of his own miserable Salvation.
estate, by nature, and be humbled for it.

Secondly, he must be persuaded of his happy estate in Christ.

Thirdly, he must practice that godly and Christian kind of life, which every
one is commanded to live, that believes in Christ.

Q What is the first thing required of him that will be saved?

A. He must know his miserable estate in himself, how wretched and how woeful
he were if God should not look upon him with favor, and mercy in the face
of Christ.

Q. Why is it needful to know our miserable estate?

A. Because the sight of it will send us more speedily to Christ. Secondly, it
will make us set greater price on the benefit, which we have by him.

Q. How does this appear?

A. For when we see, how deeply we are indebted, and endangered to God, that it
is no dribling sum that we owe him, but so huge a matter, that neither we,
nor all the friends we have, are able to discharge it; This will make us seek
more carefully to Christ to discharge it for us, and offer occasion to think
more highly of him, who has brought us a full discharge for so great a debt.

Q. What is our Estate in our selves?

A. We are dead in sins, like a Corse, that is laid out, and waits but the
burial, to be cast into the grave.

Q. How are we fallen into this estate? Fall.


A. Two ways,

Partly by Adams sins, Sin.
And partly by our own sins.
Q. What was Adams sin?

A. The eating of the forbidden fruit, whereby he wrapped up himself, and all
his Posterity in the wrath of God, as we see a Noble man by committing
Treason, not only hurts himself, but stains his blood, and does hurt to his
children too, Romans 5. 12.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That he that will stand off from Christ, had need have a good purse, when
he shall not only pay that which himself owes, but that also wherein Adam his
father was indebted to God.

Q. What is our own sin? Our sinful state.


A. Our own sin is of two sorts, 1. Original Sin, 2. Actual sin,
Romans 5. 24.

Q. What is original sin?

A. Original sin is that backwardness, and untowardness of our nature,
whereby we stand not indifferently affected, but utter enemies to all the
duties of obedience, and holiness required of us, Romans 7. 23.

Q. In what part is original sin?

A. It has stricken like a poison through all our parts, so that they are all
bent against God like a sort of Rebels, that have put themselves in arms
against their King, Gal. 5. 27.

Qu, How is the Understanding corrupted?

A. It is blind and ignorant in the things of God, and therefore even they
that are wise and witty in the matters of the world, in the matters of God are
of no capacity, and of no conceit, 1. Cor. 2. 14.

Q. How is the will corrupted?

A. It only wills and lusts after evil, like a sick man, that cares not
for wholesome meat, but his stomach only stands to sluppersauce, and that
which is naught, James 4. 5.

Q. What is Actual sin?

A. That which arises from the corruption of our nature, like sparks from a
Furnace, Galat. 5. 19.

Q. How many sorts are there of it?

A. Three sorts, 1. Evil thoughts in the mind. 2. Evil desires in the heart.
3. Evil words and works arising thence, Math. 15. 19.


Q. What gather we of this?

A. That we are not dead in some one sin, but are dead in many sins, the
soul being wounded in every part, and having bled as it were to death at every
joint.

Qu. What is the misery of this estate?

A. Exceeding great, partly in respect of sin it self, and partly in respect
of the punishment of sin, Romans 7. 24.

Qu. What is the misery of this estate in respect of sin?

A. First, that men grow worse and worse in this estate, even as a dead man,
the longer he lies above ground, the more he senteth; So they that are dead in
sin, the longer they live, the more sinful they are, as years increase, so
wickedness and sin is increased with them, 2. Tim. 3. 13.

Secondly, That men live in it without any feeling, and trouble of mind; even
as a dead man, though he sents and savors, that no man can abide him; yet he
smells it not himself, and therefore is never grieved nor troubled for it. So
they that be dead in sin, though they be loathsome both to God and man, yet
they have no feeling of their bad estate, and therefore they are never vexed
nor grieved for it, Reu. 3. 17.

Thirdly, that men seek not to come out of it, even as a dead man will never
stir his foot, nor so much as becken with his finger for one to help him,
and give him life. So they that are dead in sin, are well content to lie
still in that estate, and will not use the least means for the recovering of
themselves, Mat. 4. 16.

Fourthly, that they profit nothing by all the means that should do them
good; let the Lord ring his judgments in their ears, yet they hear no more,
then a dead man hears: let him set up never so many shining lights in the
Church, yet they see no more then a dead man sees: they taste no more sometimes
in the word, then a dead man does in his meat, Math. 13. 14.

Q. What is our misery in regard of the punishment of sin?

A. We are subject to the curse of God, both in this life, and in the life to
come, Gal. 3. 10.

Qu. What is the curse of God in this life?

A. It is of two sorts, Partly on our selves. And partly on the things that
belong to us.


Qu. What is the curse of God on our selves?

A. It is the loss of our happy estate: For whereas before we were the heirs
of God, and all his blessings belonged unto us; now we have no right, nor
interest in any of them. As a dead man loses all that his father by will had
bequeathed him.

Secondly, the calamities, that are fallen upon us; on our bodies; riches,
sickness, and death it self: on our souls; fear, sorrow and despair.

Qu. What is the curse of God on the things that belong unto us?

A. In our Goods, hindrances and losses. In our Name, infamy and reproach. In
our children, servants, parents, and friends, infinite miseries that may grieve
us.

Qu. What is the Curse of God in the life to come?

A. Eternal damnation both of body and soul in hell fire; Whereas the state
of the wicked is much more miserable then the state of a dog, or a road; For
when they die all their miseries end, but when the wicked dye, then their
greatest misery begins, Math. 25. 41.

Q What will the fight of our miserable estate work in us?

A In those that belong to God, it will work true humiliation and sorrow for
their sins. For when they shall see themselves so many ways guilty of the
wrath of God; This will melt them into tears, and turn their joys into
heaviness, and all their mirth into mourning, Acts 2. 37.

Q What gather wo^ of th^^?

A. That they, who have not truly sorrowed for their sins, nor wept as it
were at the feet of Jesus in remembrance of them, can find no sound comfort,
nor peace in Christ, Mat. 21 28.

Q What are the means to further and help on this sorrow for sin?

A. First to consider, that we and all we, so long as we live Sorrow for Sin.
in sin, are subject to the Curse of God, cursed in our selves, and cursed in
our friends, cursed in our bodies, and cursed in our souls, Deuteronomy. 28. 16. 17.

Secondly, to consider that we are subject to all the curses of God: And
therefore if some one be so heavy and intolerable, that it makes us even
weary of our lives; How will it be with us, when the whole wrath of God shall
be poured out upon us, Deuteronomy. 28. 45.

Thirdly, to consider that we are subject to the curse of God, continually,
sleeping and waking, riding and going, working and playing, living and dying,
in this life, and in the life to come, Deuteronomy. 28. 46. 47.

Fourthly, to consider that many thousands lie Damned in Hell for those sins,
where in we live. Sodom is in hell for pride, and yet we are proud. The Glutton
for abusing his wealth, and yet we abuse it. Corazin, because they profited not
by the Gospel, and yet we profit not by it, Jude 7. verse.

Fifthly, to consider our mortality, and the uncertainty of our life, that we
know not how soon we shall die, and if we die in this sore, we go oamned to
hell, Luk 12. 20.

Sixthly, to consider, that there is no means to shift away from the judgment
of God, but howsoever they seem to sleep for a while: yet they will awake,
and overtake us at the last, Number. 32. 13. 2. Pet. 2. 6.

Seventhly, to consider the judgments of God upon other men, and to weight
that what God has been to them, he will be to us, if we live in these
sins, Luke 13. 3.

Eighthly, that we use all our afflictions to this end, to consider they be for
sin; and that we have as well deserved all the rest of Gods judgments, as
these which presently lie upon us. And therefore that we sorrow not so much for
the Evils, as for our sins that are the causes of them, Lament. 5. 16.

Q. What is the second thing required of him, that would be saved?

A. He must know, and be persuaded of his happy estate in Christ.

Q What gather we of this?

A. That though sorrow for sin be necessary: Yet if any Salvation second
thing.
rest in this sorrow, and seek not the remedy in Christ, he shall never be
happy, Ierem. 50. 4. 5.

Q. What is our estate in Christ?

A. By Christ we are free from all our miseries, and fully and Christ.
clearly restored to true happiness, Romans 8. 1,

Q. How did Christ work this?

A. By bearing the whole punishment, that was due to our sins, for thereby
the justice of God was fully answered, and we discharged of all the fearful
curses that were written up against us, Gal. 3. 13.

Q How is this declared in the Scriptures?

A. By the similitude of a Debtor: If a surety discharge the debt, the
principal debtor in no good conscience can be troubled, or arrested for it.
So Christ having cancelled the Bonds, and brought us a full discharge for all
our sins, we cannot in any equity be challenged for any of them, Colos. 2.
14.

Q. What may we learn by this?

A. That as a man in a tempest betakes himself unto a tree, and the tree
bears off the rage and the violence of the storm; So we must run to shelter
and save our selves under Jesus Christ, when the rage of Gods wrath like a
tempest beats upon us, Isay 4. 6.

Q. What is the second means, whereby Christ has brought us to happiness?

A. His obedience and perfect righteousness in fulfilling the Law. For life
and happiness is often promised to those that fulfill the Law. And therefore,
seeing all the faithful have fulfilled the Law in Christ, in as much as Christ
has fulfilled it for them; They must needs live therein, and be happy by it,
Romans 8. 3. 4.

Q How is this declared?

A. As a manmakes over a Bill of debt to his friend, whereby he may recover a
great piece of money to the enriching of himself for ever: So Christ has made
over his righteousness, and obedience to us; So that now we are able to
purchase heaven, not by our own penny, but by that stock, which Christ our
rich friend has lent us, Reu. 3. 4.

Q. What may we learn from hence?

A. That as a man, when as his own legs are so weak, that they will not
bear him, he lays all upon his staff; So we must learn to lay all upon
Christ, when our own righteousness will not bear us out.

Q. What is the third means?

A. His intercession, whereby Christ is our Advocate, and entreats God the
Father for the faithful, when we are sleeping, or sinning, or not thinking on
God; Then Christ in heaven is praying and entreating for us, Romans 8. 34.

Q How does Christ pray for us?

A. Not by prostrating himself at his Fathers feet: but his very presence
before God, has in it the force of a prayer to entreat Mercy and favor.

Q. What is the means to receive Christ?

A. Faith is the only means to receive Christ, and to make Faith.
him ours: So that as a poor man reaches out his hand, and takes the bag of
gold that is given; So a man does but reach out the hand of Faith and receive
Christ, John 1. 12.

Q What gather we of this?

A. That the devil wil'lay hardest at our faith, and had rather we had any
gift, then the gift of Faith, and therefore it must be our wisdom above all
our virtues, to labor most for the nourishing, and maintaining of faith,
knowing, that without it, all the rest will do us no good, Iud. 3. verse.

Q. What is Faith?

A. Faith is a sure persuasion of the heart, that all our sins are pardoned
in Christ, and that God by means of his death is reconciled, and become
favorable to our souls, 1. Ioh. 5. 11.

Qu. How many kinds of faith are there?

A. Two kinds, An Historical faith, And a Justifying faith,


Q. What is Historical faith?

A. The Historical faith, is that, whereby a man believes in general, there
is a God, and that there is salvation in Christ, but for his life, he cannot
apply any of these things particularly to any comfort of himself, this faith
may be in the Reprobates and in the devils, James 2. 19.

Q. What is Justifying faith?

A. The Justifying faith is that whereby a man believes, not only that there
is a God; but, in particular, that he is his God. Not only, that Christ is a
Savior; but in particular, his Savior, as Thomas said in John 20. 28. Thou
art my God, and my Lord, And as Paul also says to the Galat. 2. 20. I live by
faith in the Son of God who has loved me, and given himself for me.

Q. How is it declared, that special Faith is needful?

A. If a man be impleaded for debt, it shall not be enough to say, such a man
at such a time paid a great sum of money for other men, but he must bring his
Evidence that he was one of those for whom he paid it. So it is not enough to
say, that Christ dyed for sin, unless thou be able to show thy Evidence,
even special faith, that Christ dyed for thy sin.

Q. What is the means to be get Faith?

A. The outward most usual means, whereby faith is wrought in us, is the
preaching of the word, Romans 10. 17.

Qu. What gather we of this?

A. That they that absent themselves from the preaching of the word, or mark
it not when they be present, deprive themselves of the means of Faith, and so
consequently of all the happiness, that comes by Christ.

Qu. What is the inward means?

A. The working of the Spirit of God, who opens the heart to believe those
things that are preached, Acts 16. 14.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That faith is not of our selves, but the gift of God, and therefore we
stand wholly beholden to God for our salvation, who has given us Christ, and
also the hand of Faith to receive him, Ephesians. 2. 8.

Q. Must we rest here, when faith is begotten in us?

A. We must labor by all means to strengthen and increase our faith, and
daily to grow into a more sweet feeling of the love of God in Christ, Romans 1.
17.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That those men who neglect the ordinary means to increase faith, as
preaching, praying, reading, meditating, the Sacraments and the like, have no
true saving faith: Because saving faith continually grows, and increases in
those that have it.

Q. What are the fruits and benefits of Faith?

A. We enjoy wonderful liberties, and privileges thereby. Fruits of Faith.
First, we are justified. Secondly, we are adopted and made the sons of God.
Thirdly, we are sanctified by faith in Christ.

Q. How are we justified by Faith?

A. In that Christ, having clearly discharged for all our sins, we know and
are assured upon the promise and the word of Justification.
God, that though we sin daily, and there be infinite matters of condemnation
in us: yet we shall not be challenged, nor impleaded for any of our sins,
but shall be accepted as just, and righteous for the obedience of Christ, To.
8. 33.

Q. How is this declared?

A. By a similitude; For no suite in law holds against the wife, so long as
her husband lives; but if the wife owes any thing, her husband must answer for
it: Even so when our souls by true faith are espoused and married unto Jesus
Christ, if the Devil lay any thing against us, he cannot bring his Action
against us, but against Christ our head and husband, who has undertaken to
answer for us.

Q. What is the first fruit of Justification?

A. The first fruit, is Peace of Conscience. For whereas before we had a hell
in our hearts, and our conscience was eu^g us, and arraigning us for our
sins, now we have re^^ and pe^^e with God, and as it were a heaven in our
hearts by the assurance which we have in the blood of Christ, that it has
fully and clearly discharged us of all our sins, Romans 5. 1.

Q. What is the second fruit of Justification?

A. It is joy in the holy Ghost, whereby a man rejoices with unspeakable
gladness for the great favor, and mercy of God in Christ, Romans 5. 2.

Q. What is the third fruit of Justification?

A. The third fruit is rejoicing in troubles; for all the troubles of the Godly
are the blessings of God, and are sent for their good, and therefore unless
they will grieve at Gods blessings, and the furtherance of their own good,
they cannot grieve at any of the troubles, which God in favor and mercy brings
upon them, Romans 5. 3.

Qu. What gather we of this?

A. That when the will of God is so, it is better for us to lose cur wealth,
then to have our wealth: To lose our children, then to have our children; to
part with our liberties, then to enjoy them, and therefore we ought to rest
with comfort in whatsoever it shall please God to bring upon us, Romans 5. 4.

Qu. What is the fourth fruit of Justification?

A. Sensible feeling of the love of God; for the godly shall even sensibly
perceive, that they are in good regard, and in good account with the Lord, in
that he takes not every occasion to break off, and to be angerie with them,
but passes by many injuries, and many wrongs that are done against him, Romans
5. 5.

Q. What is the second benefit we receive by faith in Christ?

A. We are daily Adopted and made the sons of God, Adoption.
Gal. 3. 26.

Q. How are we made the sons of God by faith?

A. By faith we are made one with Christ, members of his body, flesh of his
flesh, and bone of his bone, And therefore, seeing Christ is the Son of God,
we who are one with Christ, must needs be the sons of God; for being
members, and parts of Christ, we have good right and interest in all the
honor, that arises unto our Head, Ephesians. 5. 30.

Q. What are the fruits of our Adoption? Fruits of Adoption.


A. We are thereby made the heirs of God, and have all his royalties, and the
right of his Crown, and kingdom made over to us, so that if God be most
blessed, then we shall be most blessed, who must sit down in the Throne; and
in the kingdom with him, Romans 8. 17.

Qu. How stands this with the poor, and base estate of Gods children here?

A. Very well; for they are yet under age, and their lands are not yet come
into their hands, and therefore no marvel, if in this their minority, they
differ nothing from Servants, though they be Lords of all, Gal. 4. 1.

Qu. What may we learn of this?

A. To pass our days with comfort, remembering, that how hard soever our state
be in this world: yet we are the heirs of a great King, and the day will
shortly come, when we shall be fetched home with honor to endless happiness
in our Fathers house.

Q. What is the second fruit of our Adoption?

A. We are thereby put in assurance of eternal life: For the Son, says
Christ in John 8. 35. abides in the house for ever, and therefore if we be
the sons of God, we are sure that we shall abide with him for ever. A
father will not cast his children out of doors for every fault; No more will
God his children for every sin, Psalm. 89. 30.

Q. How is this further declared?

A. By the care a father has of his childrens good. For as a father will bend
all his wit and wisdom to prefer his children, and will put by as much as
he can those lets and hindrances, which may stop them from it: So God bearing
a fatherly affection to his children, will employ the uttermost of his
wisdom, and his skill to save them. And therefore, unless we will say, God
has not wisdom, or skill enough to do it, we must needs confess, that we
shall be saved, 2. Tim. 1. 12.

Q. What is the third fruit of our Adoption?

A. We grow into such confidence of God, that we dare trust him with our
whole estate; and therefore laying down our lives and our liberties, and all
we possess, at his holy feet, we are well content, he dispose of us, and of
all we have according to his own will, 2. Sam. 15. 26.

Q. What is the fourth fruit of our Adoption?

A. We are assured thereby, that God cares for us, and watches over us, and
delights to do us good, for being our Father, we may assure our selves we
shall find him a Father, even most tenderly and most fatherly affected to do
us good: So that as a father is carking and caring for his children when his
children are fast asleep: So God cares more for us, then we care for our
selves, and many times thinks of our good, when we our selves are careless
of it, Deuteronomy. 8 5. 1. Pet. 5. 7.

Q. How is this further declared?

A. A kings child shall not be suffered to go abroad without his guard: So
without a Guard of heavenly Angels, we stir not a foot: always these
heavenly warriors are attending and waiting on us, Psalm. 91. 11, 12.

Q What is the fifth fruit of our Adoption?

A. We may pray with boldness and assurance, that we shall be heard: For as a
child will moan himself to his father, thinking that if any will help him,
his own father will do it: So we may boldly pour forth all our complaints
into the lap of God with assurance, that if any man hear us, he will (being
our Father) be most ready to hear, and to help us, 1. John 5. 14.

Q What is the sixth fruit of our Adoption?

A. We know that God will accept our poor service, and our weak obedience at
our hands. For even as a father had rather hear his little child stammer,
then some others speak plainly; So God is more pleased with the weak prayers,
and the small obedience of his children, then with all the toils, and labors
of the wicked, Heb. 11. 4.

Qu. What is the third benefit we receive by faith in Christ?

A. Sanctification, whereby we are freed from the Bondage Sanctification.
of sin, and by little and little enabled through the spirit of Christ
dwelling in us, to love that which is good, and to walk in it, 1. Cor. 6. 11.

Qu. How are we sanctified by Faith?

A. Faith makes us members of Christ, and Christ is the head, distills Life and
Grace, and holiness into all his parts: So that they who are Christ's, must
needs partake of the Spirit and life of Christ, Ephesians. 4. 16.

Qu. How is this further declared?

A. As a wild Olive being ingrafted into a natural, and a kind stock,
loses his wild nature, and partaketh of the stock: So we being once
ingrafted into Christ, feel our natural corruption by little and little to
abate, and the sanctifying grace of Christ to pour forth it self into us, and
partaketh of the goodness of the stock.

Qu. What gather we of this?

A. That they which live wickedly and loosely, howsoever they profess; yet
they have indeed no part of, nor portion in Christ, Ephesians. 5. 5.

Qu. What are the fruits of Sanctification? Fruits of Sanctification.


A. First spiritual freedom and liberty, from the enbondagement of sin;
For whereas before, the Devil and Sin did so possess us, that for our
lives, we could do no more, but what he would have us. Now we have
willingness, and ableness through the spirit of Christ to live holily and
righteously in the sight of God, Luke 1. 74. 75.

Qu. What is the second fruit of Sanctification?

A. Exceeding comfort in doing well, as Christ says; It is meat and drink to
do my Fathers will: So it does us as much good as our meat, and it makes us
even glad in our hearts, when we can remember we have done any thing that
pleases God, Psalm. 119. 14.

Qu. What is the third fruit of Sanctification?

A. Deliverance from many evils, whereinto the wicked and ungodly fall, for
whereas the wicked are shamed many times for their wickedness: As theft,
treasons, oppressions, and the like; The godly living well, get a good name
amongst men, so that they which will not live like them will speak well of
them, Acts 5. 13.

Qu. What is the last fruit of Sanctification?

A. A further sealing of our election, and our adoption in Christ. For by
nature, we are wholly given to that which is naught: And therefore, if there
be any love of righteousness, or hate of sin in us, it is a token that we
are regenerated, and so consequently the sons of God, Romans 8. 14. 2. Pet. 1.
10.

Qu. What is the third thing required of him that will be saved?

A. He that will be saved, must endeavor himself to lead a Christian and a
godly life, Heb. 12. 14.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That howsoever men profess; yet unless they labor to refrain, and amend
their lives, they shall never be saved.

Qu. Seeing we are saved by faith only (...) How is good life Godliness.
needful to salvation?

A. Good life is needful not as the cause of salvation: for we are saved by
the free favor of God in Christ, but it is needful as the pathway, that
leads to salvation: Eue^ as a friend should give us a great deal of Treasure
upon the top of an hill; the treasure were ours by our friends gift, and yet
we should not enjoy it, unless we would climb up the hill: So heaven and
salvation is ours by the gift of Christ, and yet we cannot enjoy it, unless by
a godly, and a good life, we will walk unto it, 2. Tim. 1. 9.

Qu. Where must we begin the godly life?

A. First a man must labor to reform his heart, to bring it out of love with
sin, and to like well of the holy things of God, Ier. 4. 14.

Qu. How is this declared?

A. If a man would make a bad tree good, it is not enough to chop of the
branches, and the boughs, unless he change the very nature, and sap of the
tree: So unless the very nature of the heart be changed, and the innermost
affection be altered in it, all our labor in the godly life is but cast away,
2. Cor. 4. 14.

Qu. What must a man do first in reforming his heart?

A. He must clear it of those sins and corruptions, that naturally cleave
unto him: For if the best seed be sown among thorns and briars, it will never
thrive; So till sin be weeded out, let us never look that any good will
prove or prosper in the heart, Ierem. 4. 4.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they which labor after good things, and yet take no pains to weaken
their corruptions, and to shake off their sins, shall never attain to a godly
life.

Q. What sins must we labor to shake off?

A. All that cleave unto us, as the Apostle says in 2. Cor 7. 1. Let vscleanse
our selves from all filthiness of the flesh, and spirit, and grow up into full
holiness in the fear of God, Heb. 12. 1.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they which have reformed some one sin or more, and yet suffer some
other to sleep quietly and possess them, are short of the truth of the godly
life, 1. John 1. 8.

Q No man is able to free himself from every sin.

A. Yet every man must strive and labor for it, and it must Sin.
be his griese that he cannot attain it. We must not suffer sin to dwell
peaceably, and quietly in our hearts, but we must ever be warring, and
fighting to drive it thence, 2. Cor. 12. 8.

Qu. What are the helps and furtherances hereto?

A. First a man must labor to know his own heart, to grow acquainted with his
own soul, to see the special ruins and breaches that be in it: For though
we have somespice, and some grudging of every sin: yet every man has some
one special sin or more, that hurts and pesters him above the rest.

Qu. How shall a man know his special sin? Darling sin.


A. Because the devil will labor mightily to hide it from us. Therefore some
diligence must be used to discover it. First, a man must mark the course of
his life, and see what sins he is most tempted with, which sins he is least
able to resist, what of all other he can hardliest forgo, and that be it one,
or more are master sins in him.

Secondly, he must mark, what sins reign most in the place and in the
country where he dwells; what sins are the chief in his kindred, and in
those that company with him. For hardly can a man dwell in Sodom, but he
shall carry some smatch of the sin of Sodom, Genesis 19. 33.

Thirdly, he must mark the judgments of God, that fall upon him, for God
has engraven upon every judgment, the name of the sin for which he sends
it: So that a man in his punishment, may plainly read his sin. As David
sinning in his people, was punished in his people. And Pharaoh sinning in
drowning the Infants, was drowned himself. And therefore, when we are
punished in our goods, let us think we have sinned in our goods: When we are
punished in our children, then let us think we have sinned in our children,
and so in our wives in our friends, and the rest.

Fourthly, lastly if these means will not work; it is good to consult with
some wise and some dear friend of our state, and entreat him in the love of
God, and our selves, that he will tell us in truth, what sins he sees us
most prone, and inclined unto.

Qu, What must a man do for the weakening and killing of his sins?

A. When a man has found out his sins, then he must get Killing of sin.
him to the Ministry, and to the Bible, and there mark the spiritual places,
that meet with such sins; those of all other he must lay to heart, and be
continually musing, and grating on; as if a man be given to swearing, let him
look St. James 5. 12. If a man be given to lightness or the like, let him
look, Ephesians. 5. 5. Where it is said, no whoremonger, neither any unclean
person, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God; and so
every special sin, a special place, Psalm. 119. 11.

Q What gather we of this?

A. That they who either in hearing or reading the words slip by those
places, which make most against them, and strike deepest at their faults, shall
never attain to true reformation of their hearts.

Q What is the second help to weaken sin?

A. A man must mark what feeds his sin, where it gets strength. For as
fire is nourished with fuel: so there is ever somewhat that nourishes our
sins: If a man can find that, and reform it, he shall soon weaken the
greatest corruption that is within him. As if companiedraw thee to sin, away
with that company: If fear of displeasure, away with that fear: If hope of
commodities, away with that hope, Math. 5. 29.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they, who say they would feign leave sin, and yet leave not such
company, use such pastimes, such means as they know cannot but nourish and
increase it in them, do but deceive themselves. As if a man would clap dry
^aggots upon the fire, and say he does mean to quench it, when indeed he
kindles it the more.

Q. What is the third help to weaken sin?

A. A man must cry to heaven, and beg the Lords aid and his helping hand; as
a little child, if he have a tough stick, which he cannot break, runs to
his father with it, that he may break it for him: So because we cannot master
our sins, therefore we must run to God by prayer, that he may master them
and kill them in us, Psalm. 41. 4.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they who purpose and resolve to leave their sins, and yet are not
often upon their knees craving strength from heaven, and grace to leave them,
shall never shake them off.

Q. What if these things work not?

A. If these things work not upon us, we must consider what is thereason, why
they do not work; either we do not use them so diligently, and so carefully
as we should, or else we have used them but a little while: A man cannot fell
a great Oak with one stroke of an Axe, it will ask him many a blow: So our
sins being of so great a growth, will not quickly down. It is well if after
many labors, and much pains, we may feel them begin, 2. Cor. 12. 8. or else
the heart may not yet be loosened from some darling eorruption, until which
time all means are ineffectual, Psalm.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they who use these means for a spirt, and practice them not
continually and wholly, shall never get any sound comfort, or profit by them.

Q. What is the second thing a man must do in the reforming of his heart?

A. When a man has weeded out his sins, he must not then give over, but
fall to work a fresh, and labor to plant somewhat in the garden of his soul:
as one vice goes out, so he must labor to plant an other virtue in the room,
Hos. 10. 12.

Q. What gather we of this?

Q. That a man must not think his conversion to be true, unless he be
carried with as great love to godliness, as ever he was to wickedness, and
be as careful for good things, as ever he was for evil. And therefore they
that are come from Popery, and stick there, having got no judgment, nor
knowledge in the Gospel, do but deceive themselves: As they also, who will
not openly break the Sabbath, and yet are not careful to sanctify it in the
holy duties thereof, Psalm. 27. 27.

Q What are the things we must first plant in the heart?

A. A love of God, to delight in him, as in the greatest portion we have in
this world, to rest in him with joy and contentment, Love of God.
as in our chiefest good: to set more price on him, then we do on all the
world besides. And therefore having such a Jewel, and such a wonderful
treasure of the Lord, we account all our wants to be nothing, so long as we
want not him: All our losses nothing, so long as we lose not him: All
displeasures light, so long as God is not displeased with us, Math. 21. 38.

Q. Why must we begin at the love of God?

A. Because the love of God is the fountain of all true obedience, and it
sends forth the careful Christian to good works: For loving God, he will
seek to do that which God may like of, and will willingly do nothing that
may displease him: Even as if a man have a dear friend, he will not willingly
do any thing that may offend him: but will seek by all duties to make his
love and his good heart known unto him.

Q. How may we bring our hearts in love with God?

A. By considering what God has been to us, and what we have been to him:
We, the worst of all his creatures, worse then Toades or Snakes, for they
sin not against God, but we sin against him: Worse then the Jews, for
they crucified Christ but once, but we buffet him, and pierce him with our
sins every day, worse then any of the damned Ghosts, that lie damned in hell,
for they sinned in darkness, but we sin in the light, they having but weak
means, we having many great helps to weaken sin, and yet (mirror of
mercy) none so spared, as we are spared; none so blessed, as we are blessed;
none so loved, as we are loved of the Lord. And therefore how can we, but even
burn in love toward him again, and make more reckoning of him, then of all
the world besides, Solomon's song. 2. 5.

Q. What is the second thing?

A. The fear of God, to be more afraid to displease him, Fear of God.
then all the Princes and powers in the world. To be more abashed, and more
ashamed, when God sees us sin, then if all the eyes in the world were gazing
on us, Genesis 28. 17.

Q What will this work in us?

A. The fear of God will be as a bank, to keep in the raging lusts of the
heart, that they break not out; Even as the Sea bank beats back the waves,
and breaks the force of them, that they cannot ouerflow, Ier. 32. 40.

Q. How may we settle the fear of God in our hearts?

A. First, by considering the great power, and the mighty arm of God, that he
is more able to do us more harm, then all the powers in the world can do.
And therefore if we fear to displease a Prince who can kill but our bodies;
how much more should we fear to displease God, who can damn our souls, Isay
51. 12. 13.

Secondly, by persuading our selves, that we are always in Gods presence,
that he ever looks upon us with a bright and a shining face; So that we do
nothing but what God sees us do; we speak nothing, but what he hears us
speak. And therefore if a man's presence would bash us, how much more should
the holy presence of God strike fear, and reverence into our hearts.

Q. What is the third thing?

A. Knowledge of the will of God, to understand what is holy, and what is
unholy: what is right, and what is wrong: what is pleasing, and what is
displeasing in his sight, Ephesians. 5. 17.

Q. What are the parts of this Knowledge?

A. Two 1. Spiritual Wisdom, 2. Spiritual understanding,
Coloss 1. 9.

Q. What is spiritual understanding? Spiritual understanding.


A. A general knowledge, what is to be done, Prou. 9. 10.

Q. What is spiritual Wisdom? Wisdom.


A. A particular waighing of the circumstance of time, place, and person, to
know what is expedient, 1. Cor. 6. 12.

Q. What is the use of our Knowledge?

A. It will be, as a candle of the soul to light it, and shine unto it in the
ways of God: For many times we sin, when we think we do not sin; and
many times we would do well, if we had knowledge and judgment how to do it,
Ephesians. 1. 18.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they which say, they carry as good a mind to religion as the best,
and yet take no pains to grow in the knowledge of it, do but deceive
themselves, Hos. 4. 6.

Q. What is the fourth thing?

A. Obedience to the will of God: to have our hearts at commandment, so that
in any duty at any time, we can have it pressed Obedience.
and ready for the Lord; So that if God say but love this, we can love it: If
God say, bear this, we can bear it: If God say, but leave this, we can leave
it. And this not only, when Gods will and our affection suit together, but
even then, when there is an utter disagreement between them, Ier. 42. 6.

Q. How may we bring our hearts to obedience?

A. First, to consider that God loves us dearly: And therefore, he will never
command any thing at our hands, but it shall be for our good, Ier. 32. 39.

Secondly to consider, God is far wiser then we, and therefore his course is
better then ours, Psalm. 119. 24.

Thirdly, to consider, we owe our lives and our liberties, and all we have to
God, and therefore when God commands, he commands but his own, 1. Cor. 6. 19.
20.

Fourthly, to consider, we shall have no good success in our ways, if we
leave the Lords, Hos. 5. 13.

Fifthly, to consider, that the Lord will not bless us in his own ways, what
unlikelihood soever there be, that it shall not speed, Psalm. 37. 3.

Sixthly, lastly to consider, that our obedience to God, is the placing of him
in his seat of glory, and as it were, the crowning of him to be our King: So
that to disobey him, is to disclaim, and renounce his dominion over us, Deuteronomy.
26. 17.

Q. What is the second general thing required of us?

A. Well ordering of the life, that our whole behavior be seemly and
seasoned with grace, as well when we are in secret, as in the sight of men,
Ephesians. 2. 10.

Q. What must we first do in the well ordering of our life?

A. We must sit down and consider our state, of what condition, Ordering of
our life.
and place we be. If a Christian, then we stand charged with the duties of a
Christian: If a master, then we perform the duties of a master: If a Father,
then the duties of a Father, and so of the rest.

Q. What are the common duties of every Christian?

A. They be of three sorts, 1. To live soberly in respect of himself. 2. To
live righteously, in respect of his neighbor. 3. To live holily in respect of
God, Tit. 2. 12.


Q. Why does the Apostle begin first with our selves?

A. Because a man is given naturally to love himself, and to seek his own
good. And therefore if we cannot hold within compass of duty toward our
selves, much less shall we be able toward others.

Q. What is the duty which we owe unto our selves?

A. To live soberly, and temperately in this present world.

Q. What is this sobriety which the Apostle speaks of?

A. A moderate, and sparing use of our lawful liberties; which moderation must
be kept in all the actions that concern Sobriety.
our selves; in our diet, in our recreations, in our mirth, in our sorrows,
and so in the rest.

Q. How shall we keep this godly moderation in our Diet?

A If two things be cared for: First, that it be not too costly, too
sumptuous: no though our purse will bear it, and our ability In Diet.
reach unto it. The Glutton, which we read of in the Gospel, was able enough
to maintain his cheer, for he dyed rich. And yet for his feasting on earth,
he was saine to fast in hell: And the Devils made as merry with his soul, as
ever he made merry with his meat, Luke 16. 19.

Q. Is it not lawful to feast our Neighbors?

A. Yes, it is lawful to make Feasts of love, as the old Christians did in
Jude 12. verse. But neither must this be common, nor usual every day, nor to
fare more then for honest and sober delight. Not common, Isay 56. 12. Not
excessive, Nehemiah 5. 18.

Q. What is the second thing?

A. We must look, that we use not those meats and drinks, which we have (how
homely, and how mean soever they be) intemperately, that we do not surfeit,
nor feed cormorantly, to the glutting, and whole satisfying of the flesh:
washing our brains with drink, and basting our bodies with meat, more then
needs, Ezekiel. 16. 19. Fullness of bread, was one of the sins of Sodom, Isay
5. 22.

Q. How shall we be sober and moderate in our Apparel?

A. If it be not too garish, too light, too costly, or strange, In Apparel.
but grave, usual, beseeming our Calling and our Country, strange Attire is
condemned, Ephesians. 1. 18. light and wanton Attire 1: Tim. 2. 9.

Q. Do the Scriptures give any certain directions for Attire?

A. There are two Rules to be kept in our Attire. First, that we do not
stretch forth our selves unto all that we may, and go as far as our place
and ability will let us, but cut short off some part of that which is lawful,
for men of our degree, 1. Tim. 2. 9.

Secondly, that we square our selves to the most sober of our age, degree,
condition, and state of life, 1. Pet. 3. 5. Also we have an example in the 2.
Sam. 13. 18. where the holy Ghost clears King David, that he gave no occasion
to the evil which came upon his daughter, because in apparel he kept her
within the rule appointed, and let her go no otherwise, then other maids of
her age, place, and condition went.

Q. Is nothing but apparel to be cared for?

A. Yes, regard must be had of our gate, of our hair, of whatsoever we are set
out, and attyred with. In this also an honest, and godly moderation must be
used, That our gate be not stately and proud: That our hair be not indecently
long: That no more ornaments be hanged upon us, then seemelinesse, and that
Christian sobriety, which has been spoken of, will permit. Of the gate, Isay
3. 16. Of the rest, 1. Pet. 3. 3.

Q. Is it not lawful for men to have long hair?

A. The Apostle says 1. Corinthians. 12. 14. It is a shame for a man if he wear
long hair. And therefore unless it be not lawful for men to shame
themselves, it is not lawful for men to have long hair: And he give us such a
reason, as being well weighed, may move them much; Does not nature it self
teach you, says he; As if he had said, Though men have neither religion nor
honesty, nor grace, nor any conscience in them: yet nature it self may teach
them, that when they glory in their long locks, they glory in their shame.

Q. How may we use our recreations moderately and lawfully?

A. If we be not excessive in them, if we spend not too much time upon them,
but use them so sparingly, that thereby we may become the more fit, and
cheerful in our calling, Colos. 4. 5. and redeem the time which we do not,
when our exercises do not make us more fit for our duties.

Secondly, if we be not eagerly set upon them, that we fall to swearing,
chafing, fretting, quarrelling, or hurting our neighbors corn, grass,
cattle, and the like.

Thirdly, if we use them at lawful and convenient times, not when we have
fitness to better things, nor upon the Sabbath, nor in time of private, or
public mourning, Ecles. 3. 1.

Q. Why may we not use them, when we are fit for better things?

A. Because Recreations are permitted only to refresh us, and therefore if we
play when we are as well able to work, or to pray, or to read, or to do some
such better things, we abuse our liberty, because we run to recreations
before we need them.

Q. Why may we not use them on the Sabbath?

A. Because the whole day is set apart for the service of God, Isay 58. 13.

Qu. Why not in the time of mourning?

A. Because we may not laugh, when God would have us weep: We may not be
sporting, when we had more need be repenting for our sins, Isay 22. 12. 13.
14.

Qu. How may we be sober and moderate in resting from our labors?

A. If no more time be spent in our rest, then may well serve to refresh us,
Mark 6. 31. In Labors.


Q. How may we always keep our selves in work?

A. If we consider, that the Lord has stored us with such variety of duties,
that we need not be idle one hour in a day. In work.
If we cannot work, yet we may read: If we cannot read, yet we may hear
others read: If not that, yet we may pray or meditate, or comfort our
brethren. If we tired in one, yet we may recreate, and refresh our selves in
another, Coloss. 4. 5.

Qu. How may we be sober and moderate in our sorrows?

A. If we observe three things. First, that we grieve not In Sorrows.
our selves for every needless thing; for the Lord would have us live in some
comfort, and in some cheer: And therefore, we must not take every thing to
heart, and make our lives wearisome and bitter to us, Phil. 4. 4.

Secondly, that we grieve less for matters of less weight, and more for
matters of greatest weight: More for our sins, then we do for our troubles,
and more when we lose God, then when we part with our dearest friends,
Zachariah 12. 10.

Thirdly, that we suffer not our selves to be swallowed up of sorrow, no
though it be for the best things, 2. Cor. 2. 7.

Qu. How may we be sober and moderate in our mirth?

A. If we weigh the matter of our joy, that we never rejoice In our Mirth.
in evil things, as in jesting, scoffing, talking wantonly, nor in those
things that are transitory, and pass away; as in riches, favor, honor,
further then they are pawnes and pledges of the love of God (not in evil
things, 1. Cor. 5. 6. not in transitory, Ier. 9. 23. and the 24. Job 31. 25.

Secondly, if we show not too great lightness in our mirth, but always it
have some seasoning of Christian gravity in it, Ephesians. 5. 4.

Thirdly, if we be not merry, when our own sins, or our brethrens miseries,
give us more cause to mourn, Hos. 9. 1. Amos 6. 5. 6.

Q. Are there no other things, wherein sobriety must be showed?

A. Yes, many other things, as in our sleep, in our fears, and in our cares
for the world, and the like; But by these few, which have been handled, we may
measure out all the rest.

Q. What is the duty which we owe to men?

A. To live righteously, that is to give every man that which To men
Righteousness.
is his due, Romans 13. 7.

Q. What is their due?

A. That we love them in their persons, both in their bodies and in their
souls, in their goods, in their good names, and in every thing that belongs
unto them, Romans 13. 8.

Q. How may we show love in their persons?

A. Three ways, 1. In our Affections, 2. In our Words, 3. In our Deeds,
1. John 3. 18.

Q. How in our Affections?

A. We must not rashly be angry with them, for love suffers In our
Assections.
long, it will put up many injuries, and pass by many wrongs, and therefore
they that fall out, and suffer their love to quench for every offense, declare
evidently they have no love, See Solomon's Song 8. 7.

Q May we not be angry?

A. Yes: but therein three things must be looked unto. First, Anger.
that the cause be just and earnest, Math. 5. 22.

Secondly, that our anger be not furious: that it break not out into
immoderate heat, into cursing, banning, reuiling and the like, Ephesians. 4. 31.

Thirdly, that it hold not long, for both should seek Reconciliation: As the
father ran to meet his son and the son his father. And therefore, they
that being once salne out, will never be reconciled again, or strain
courtesy, who shall begin, bewray notably their want of love, Ephesians. 4. 16. 1.
Cor. 3. 12. 13.

Q. What is the second point of Inward love?

A. We must not envy their good: It must not grieve us to see others
wealthier, wiser, and better thought of then ourselves: We must be as glad of
their welfare, as of our own, and rejoice as much to hear them praised, as we
would do if our selves were commended, Romans 12. 15.

Q. What is the third point of Inward love?

A. We must not take that which may be well meant in evil part: we must not
be too jealous, and too suspicious of our brethren, upon every conceit,
thinking hardly of them, Romans 1. 29.

Q. What is the fourth point of Inward love?

A. We must not disdain them, nor set up our selves against them: For though
in some one gift, they came behind us, yet happily in some other they go
before us; and though they do not, yet happily, they have not had such helps,
such means, so many sweet motions to bring them on as we have had, Phil. 2. 3.

Q. How must we show our love in our words?

A. We must not speak bitterly, scoffingly, nor crossely to In Words.
them: if we be wronged, yet we must deal coldly, gently, and mildely with
them, not bitterly, James 4. 11. not scoffingly, Genesis 21. 9. 10. not crossely,
Pro. 15. 1.

Q. May we not be sometimes sharp in our speech?

A. Yes, but in Gods cause, rather then in our own, and neither in both, till
we see gentle means will not work: as a Physician uses strong Medicines,
when the weaker will not help, Nehem. 13. 25.

Secondly, we must not speak evil of them behind their backs, but by love
conceal those infirmities that are in them, unless either Gods glory, or
their good shall require an opening of their faults, 1. Pet. 4. 8. 1. Cor. 11.
11.

Thirdly, we must not brawle, and wrangle contentiously about questions that
shall arise amongst us, 1. Pet. 3. 15. 16.

Q How must we show love to them in our deeds?

A. We must not withdraw our selves from them in their In our Deeds.
needs, but to our power and ability, seek to make their lives sweet and
comfortable to them; We must not be altogether our own men, shut up within our
own profit, and pleasures, and wholly taken up of them: But by love we must
go out of our selves to the good and profit of our Brethren, Deuteronomy. 15. 7. to
the 11.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they who are so far off from helping their needy brethren; that they
make even a spoil, and a prey of them, most unchristianly increasing their
miseries, and by usury and hard bargains, putting of them further into debt
and danger, they have no drop of humanity, much less any sound ground of
Christianity in them, Leu. 35. 36.

Qu. What other thing is there wherein we must show our love?

A. We must not do any violence to their person, we must neither smite them,
nor hurt them in life or limb, as appears, Leuit. 24. 19. 20. For though the
Ceremony of that Law be now abrogated, yet the equity of it stands still in
strength.

Qu. What further thing is there to declare our love?

A. We must not procure hurt to their persons by any means, Love to their
Persons.
so tenderly the Lord would have us regard our brethren, that we should not be
any occasion, whereby hurt and dammagement may grow unto them, 1. Chron. 11. 19.

Qu. What gather we of this?

A. That they who delay suites in law, or blow tales into men's heads, and so
give occasion of blood, or they that rashly venture men's lives for their profit
or pleasure, are highly guilty of the want of love.

Qu. Shall we think our selves discharged toward our Brethrens persons, when
we have performed this?

A. No, the chiefest thing is yet behind, love to their souls, which is the
very life of Christian love, Romans 10. 1.

Qu. How must we love them in their souls?

A. We must mourn and be sorry for their sins, as Christ Souls.
wept over Jerusalem; so we must weep over the souls of our brethren, Ier.
13. 17.

Qu. What is the second thing?

A. We must pray for them, that the Lord would forgive them, and fill their
hearts with the riches of his grace, James 15. 16.

Q. May not one man's prayer get pardon for another man's sins?

A. It may, as it appears in the 1. John 5. 16. and yet not without the faith
of him, whom we pray for: For without faith it is impossible to please God,
Heb. 11. 6.

Q What gather we of this?

A. That they who see other men drowned in sin, and yet are not often upon
their knees to entreat the Lord heartily, and earnestly for them, are highly
guilty of neglect of duty toward them.

Q. What is the third thing?

A. We must labor to draw them to Christ; as one candle In drawing them to
Christ.
lights another: so one man must bring another to God; As Peter being
converted, must convert his brethren; so we being turned, must turn others to
the faith, Zach. 8. 21.

Q. What is the fourth thing?

A. We must bring them on, being come, we must encourage ^o encourage them.
them, and lead them forward in the ways of God. As a man plies a lamp with
oil: so we must nourish and feed good things in them, that they go not out,
Heb. 10. 24. 25.

Qu. How is this declared?

A. By a similitude: for as in a great Family where are many children, the
elder help to carry and tend the younger: So in the family and household of
God, the antienter and elder Christians must help and support and bring
forward those that are the weaker, and came lately to the faith, Acts 18. 27.

Q. What is the last thing?

A. We must admonish them of their faults; For he that rebukes not his brother
of his sin, hates him in his heart, Leuit. Admonition.
19. 17.

Qu. How does this appear?

A. Because we know the Lord will punish his sin and bring it to light: And
therefore, if we dissemble and admonish him not to leave it, what do we else
but desire the Lord to blaze him, and to shame him for it?

Q Yea, but men will be angry with us if we tell them their f^ult^.

A. And God will be angry if we tell them not. And therefore it is better to
lose men's favors then Gods favor, and to have our neighbors displeasure then
Gods displeasure: And yet many times that falls out that Solomon speaks of,
Prou. 28. 23.

Q. What things are to be regarded in reproving?

A. Three things: First, that we do it mildely and lovingly, that we set not
too eagerly and too hardly on them, Gal. 6. 1.

Secondly, that we do it mightily and with power, not only making them see
their sins, but even all the shame of it, to bring them to a greater hatred
and loathing of it, Micah 3. 8.

Thirdly, that we do it discreetly, not casting of precious seed upon every
ground; but having some hope of the party, that it shall do good, Prou. 9. 8.
Math. 7. 6.

Qu. Is every profane man to be given over in his sins?

A. Surely no: Great care must be had that we judge not men past physic, till
their disease be grown very desperate indeed. Though a man have been a
scorner before, yet we know not whether now he may leave it. And though he
have been very impatient of reproof at other men's hands, yet we know not how
he may take it at ours. And therefore, as long as there is any spark of hope,
we must not cease mildely to admonish them of their faults, Mark 12. 4. 5. 6.

Qu. What is the second Point to our neighbors?

A. We must love them in their goods: For love not only We must love them in
their goods.
regards the person of our neighbor, but also deals tenderly and lovingly
with all those things that belong unto him; So that if any thing of his shall
not find honest and trusty dealing at our hands, there shall be just cause to
arrest, and indict us of the want of love, Romans 13. 9.

Qu. How must we love them in their goods?

A. First, we must preserve them the best we can.

Secondly, we must not withhold or detain any thing from them.

Thirdly, we must not take away, either by force or fraud, any thing that is
theirs.

Q. What does the first point teach us?

A. That if our neighbors house, or cattle, or corn be endangered, every
man must lend his helping hand to preserve them safe. If our neighbors house
be on fire, every man runs with his bucket to quench it. So if our neighbor
be oppressed in law, every man must help to defend his right; If by sickness
he be cast behind, we must further him and help him the best we can, Exodus
23. 4. 5.

Q. Who be they that offend in this Duty of love?

A. First, they that suffer their cattle through negligence to break into
other men's grounds, and when they have trespassed him, are not willing and
ready to make ull recompense for their hurts, Exodus 22. 5.

Secondly, they who hurt or lugge their neighbors cattle excessiuely. For
what conscience or equity is this, that a man for half a pennyworth of
grass, should do his neighbors beast a shillings-worth of harm Exodus 22. and
the 5. 6. verse.

Thirdly, they that turn their own dangers upon their neighbors neck, as
they that turn the ouershoote of their water upon their neighbors land, or by
many means draw him into peril that themselves may escape, Luke 6. 31.

Fourthly, they that can give evidence in a matter, and yet by their silence
suffer their neighbor to be defeated of his right, Leuit. 5. 1.

Fifthly, they that will run to law for every injury, and for every wrong. For
though a man have done us some harm, yet that is no reason why we should waste
him in the law, and turn him out of all he has: But we must seek as near
as may be, that his punishment may be answerable and equal to his offense, 1.
Cor. 6. 7.

Q. What is the second thing whereby we must show love to our Neighbors goods?

A. We must not withold or keep back any thing that is his, but restore
with conscience and care, whatsoever in any right or equity belongs unto him,
Prou. 3. 27.

Q. Who be they that offend in this?

A. First, they that keep back the laborers hyre; not only they that
defeat him of his wages; but even they also, that keep it in their hands when
it should do them good, Deuteronomy. 24. 15.

Secondly, they that are not careful to discharge their own debts, Psalm. 37.
21.

Thirdly, they that find any thing that was lost, and are not careful to
restore it: For as a Master lays certain loose money up and down his house,
to try whether his servants will steal it: So when we light upon any thing
that was lost, let us remember, the Lord makes trial of our honesty, whether
we will possess with an evil Conscience one pennyworth of our neighbors
goods or no, Deuteronomy. 21. 3.

Fourthly, they that have hired or borrowed, or taken any thing to keep, and
are not careful as much as in them lies to restore it as good as it came,
Exodus 22. 14.

Q What is the third thing whereby we must show love to our Neighbors goods?

A. We must not get away by force or fraud any thing, that is his: we must
suffer him to rest in a peaceable possession of those things which the Lord in
mercy for the comfort of his life, has cast upon him, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 6.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That in bargaining, we must always give him a pennyworth of ware for his
penny: Covetousness and greediness of gain must not rate our Commodity, and
set price upon our Wares, but we must look as near as may be, that the
goodness of the Commodity we sell, even in truth and good conscience be
quall to that money the Buyer pays for it, Leuit. 25. 14. 15. 16.

Q. Who be they that are condemned hereby?

A. First, it condemns all uttering of deceitful and naughty wares, Amos 8.
6. 7.

Secondly, it condemns those that ouersell their Commodities, and labor to
drive the price as high as possibly they can, Amos 8. 4. 5.

Thirdly, it condemns those that use false Measures and false weights, or if
they be true, yet they can so cunningly convey the matter, and help it with a
slight, that the Buyer is sure to come short of his due, Deuteronomy. 25. 15. to the
16.

Fourthly, it condemns those that lie in the wind to prey upon a man (that
must needs sell his Commodities for ready money) to get them for half the
worth: For what is it to oppress our brethren in bargaining, if this be not
to oppress them.

Q. What other Duty are we charged with?

A. We must not take Interest, or Usury of our Neighbors, for all usury is
biting usury, howsoever some can lick themselves Usury.
whole again, yet the greatest part carry the print of the Usurers teeth to
their dying day, Exodus 22. 25.

Qu, What is Usurie?

A. Usury is a certain gain exacted by Covenant above the Principal, only
in lieu and recompense of the lending of it: and it is clearly condemned by
the Lord, Deuteronomy. 23. 19.

Q Does not the Princes law allow Usurie 10. pounds in the 100. pounds?

A. The Princes Law restrains Usury, but allows it not; The Prince had
rather men would lend freely to their brethren, but if they will not for the
hardness of men's hearts he permits 8. in the 100. lest they should take 20. in
the 100.

Q Why is not Usury condemned in the New Testament?

A. Because it is sufficiently condemned in the Old: For the Moral law always
stands in strength and is never repealed: And therefore Usury being a branch
of the moral Law, in as much as it concerns love, and good dealing too with
our neighbor, is as strictly forbidden in the New Testament, as it was in the
Old, Math. 5. 17.

Q. What is the last duty we learn from hence?

A. We must not filch or pilfer the least pin or point from our Neighbor:
for it is not the value, but the dishonest manner of coming by a thing that
makes it theft, Ephesians. 4. 28,

Qu. What is the root of all hard dealing with our brethren?

A. Covetousness and greedy desire of gain, for why do men rack the prises
of their Wares? Why do they scant their measures? Why do they sell they care
not what? Why are they Usurers, oppressors, pilferers, and the like? But
because their hearts run after covetousness, and they are mightily overtaken
with greediness of gain, 1. Tim. 6. 10.

Q What are the causes of Covetousness?

A. There are two causes of it. First, coffeehouse with Covetousness.
our present state, not resting in it, as in our portion with great
thankfulness of heart to God for it. For when we are once fallen into love with
a better state, and grow discontented with the present blessings of God that
are upon us: then we fall to scraping, and fetching in we care not how, 1. Tim
6, 9.

Secondly, Infidelity and distrust in God, mistrusting the Lords care, that
he will leave us in the dust, and not provide sufficiently for us; we think
to make shift for our selves, and to be furnished for a rainie day, though the
Lord should leave us. Heb. 13. 5.

Qu. What are the remedies of it?

A. The remedies are two: First to rest contented with our present estate, as
in the portion which the Lord in wisdom knows to be fitrest for us, Phil. 4.
11.

Secondly, to have hearts strongly persuaded, that the Lord will not leave us
nor forsake us in our need, but graciously will supply us with the riches of
his power, whatsoever is wanting in us, 1. Pet. 5. 7.

Qu. What is the last thing wherein we must love our brethren?

A. We must love them in their names, taking care for their credit and
estimation, that we bring not any blot or blemish upon them, but by love,
maintain and uphold their good report, Tit. 3. 2.

Qu. What is the first duty we are charged with in this behalf?

A. Whenever occasion serves, we must be willing to make report of those
graces and good things that be in them, and to bestow their just and deserved
commendations on them: We must not be given to smother and conceal our
brethrens praise, to bury and rake up their commendations in the dust, but be
forward in remembering those things, whereby credit and estimation may grow
unto them, 3. John 12. verse.

Q. What is the second duty required of us?

A. If we hear them falsely charged with any crime, we must stand out in their
defense, being content to hazard and adventure some part of our own credit
and welfare for them, 1. Sam. 20. 32.

Q. What is the third duty required of us?

A. We must not raise up any slander or lying tale against them. It is a foul
sin to gadde up and down from house to house, whispering in this bodies
ear, and that bodies ear; this tale and that tale to the discrediting of our
brethren, Leu. 19. 17.

Q. What is the fourth duty required of us?

A. We must not open our ears to give entertainment to them that carry tales.
For the law of God not only condemns those that first set them on foot, but
even those also, that by approving them, and lending an ear unto them, do as
it were underprop, and uphold the same. And therefore it shall be no excuse
to say, that we were not the authors, and first b^oachers of them: But if we
be hasty to harken to flying tales, or give countenance to every busy body
that will fill our ears; there shall be just cause to condemn us in this
behalf, Exodus 23. 1. Prou. 25. 23.

Q What is the fifth Duty required of us?

A. We must not blaze abroad the infirmities and offenses of our brethren; if
by any private dealing they may be reformed, Prou. 11. 13.

Q. What is the last Duty required of us?

A. We must not amplify and aggrauate men's faults, though they be bad, yet we
must not make them worse then they be: For this shall even make our enemies
say, we love them, when they see we do not rack and tenter their faults, but
speak so sparingly and so tenderly of them, as possibly we can, Acts 16. 22.

Q. What is the duty we owe to God?

A. That we live godly and holily in this present world: So that it is not
enough to discharge our duties toward men, unless Godliness.
also we walk carefully in those duties that concern the Lord, 1. Tim. 4. 7.

Q. What is the first Point of godliness?

A. We must labor to show in our life that we love the Lord: That we have him
in high account and in high regard: that we reckon more of him, then we do of
all the world besides, Deuteronomy. 10. 12.

Q. How may we show that we love the Lord?

A. If we be more careful to please the Lord, and to keep his favor, then
we be to please all the Princes and powers in the world besides, John 14. 15.

Secondly, if we love the children of God; for loving the wisdom, the
righteousness, and the holiness which is in God, we cannot but love even the
least spark of these excellent things in whomsoever we find them, 1. John 5.
1.

Thirdly, if we be zealously affected for the glory of God, so that we be
ready to stand out in the Lords defense, and to oppose our selves against every
profane head, that lifts up it self against him, John 2. 17.

Fourthly, if we rejoice and take sensible comfort in the favor of God, and
contrariwise grieve and mourn whenever we find him displeased with us,
Psalm. 4. 6. 7.

Q. What is the second Point of godliness?

A. We must show that we trust in God, that we are strongly Second poi^^
Godliness. Trusting in God.
persuaded in our hearts, that seeing God has taken upon himself the care,
and provision for us; Therefore it shall go well with us, and he will store us
and provide us of every thing that is needful for the comfort of our life, 1.
Pet. 5. 7.

Q. How shall we show that we trust in God?

A. If we be joyful and comfortable in our wants, not clean out of heart,
and at our wits end as the wicked are, Math. 8. 25. 16.

Secondly, if we fall not to unlawful shifts, winding our selves out of danger
we care not how, 1. Sam. 27. 1.

Q. What is the third point of godliness?

A. We must humble our selves under the mighty hand of God, bearing patiently
and contentedly those crosses and troubles Thirdly Humbling,
that he brings upon us, 1. Pet 5. 6.

Q. How may we strengthen our selves to be patient in troubles?

A. First, to consider, that it is our own sin that has pulled these
judgments on us, Micah 7. 9. Affliction.


Secondly, to consider, that it is the Lord that afflicts us, who having
absolute power over us, may dispose of us either by poverty or plenty, by
sickness or health, by life or death, as best pleases him, 1. Sam. 3. 18.

Thirdly, to consider, that they shall turn to their greatest comfort in the
end. So that God may seem to afflict his children, only to sweeten and relish
their prosperity, 2. Sam. 16. 12.

Fourthly, to consider, that though the Lord have deprived us of one blessing,
yet he has left us many others to rejoice in: Even as if a man having
forfeited an hundred pounds, and the Creditour should take but 100. shillings
of him: So when we by sin have forfeited all our blessings, and all the
comforts of our life: yet the Lord straineth but some one part and portion of
them, Lamen. 3. 22.

Fifthly, to consider, that impatiencie does but increase our cross; like one
in Irons, that struggling and striving to wring them off, hurts himself more
then the Irons do, Luke 21. 19.

Q. What is the fourth point of godliness?

A. We must be diligent in commending our whole estate Fourthly Prayer.
by earnest prayer unto God; For therein we do the Lord this honor, that we
acknowledge our whole welfare to depend on him, and it is he alone that
blesses all things that we take in hand: And therefore we must never begin
any thing without prayer: We must not eat unless we first pray God to
bless that we eat: We must not give, unless we pray God to bless that we
give, 1. Thessalonians 5. 17.

Q. What is the Reason?

A. There is a double use of the good things of God, A lawful use, and An holy
use.


Q. What be they?

A. As when a man eats, or refreshes himself, or sleeps moderately; when
he utters his Commodities at a reasonable rate, then he does these things
lawfully: But when he sanctifies and performs all these things with holy
prayer unto God: Then, he uses them not only lawfully but holily too. So that
by this means our thoughts are holy, and our works holy, our recreations
holy, yea and our sleep is holy to the Lord, 1. Sam. 3. 5.

Q. What think you then of giving thanks before meat?

A. It is a holy use sanctified by the example of Christ and much commended by
the Scriptures; our Savior Christ looked to heaven and blessed the loaves and
fishes, Math. 13. 19. So did Paul, Acts 27. 35. And we read of the people in
the 1. Sam. 9. 13. That they would not eat of the Sacrifice till Samuel had
blessed it. And therefore their boldness is great, that dare use the creatures
of God with greater boldness then Paul or Samuel, yea and the Son of God
himself would use them.

Q. Is it not good to have certain set times of Prayer in our houses?

A. It is very needful, the rather thereby to draw our selves into Gods
presence, and to bring our selves in remembrance of this great duty, that lies
upon us, as Daniel 6. 10.

Q. What are the fittest times to set apart for Prayer?

A. The Morning and the Evening. In the morning we must pray that the Lord will
lead us throughout the day: That he will shroud us and shadow us under the
wings of his grace, and be with us in every thing we take in hand. And this may
be termed the morning Sacrifice of a Christian, Psalm. 5. 3. At night again we
must reckon with the Lord for the sins of the day, that we lie not down in
Gods displeasure: but having reconciled, and as it were made even for our
faults, we may sleep in the lap and bosom of the love of God. And this may
be termed, The evening Sacrifice of a Christian, Psalm. 141. 2.

Q. How is this further declared?

A. As Noah's Dove, having wandered all day abroad, yet returned, in the Evening
to the Arc: So we having toyled, and labored all day in the world; yet at
night we must be careful to return, and take up our rest (as it were) with
God.

Q. Are we to rest our selves in this thing?

A. We must not think our selves discharged, when these set times of prayer
be performed: but many times in the day, we must lift up our hearts to God in
the heat of all our business: bethink us of the Lord, who alone can prosper
and bless that which we have in hand.

Q. What is the fifth Point of godliness?

A. We must lift up our hearts with great thankfulness unto God for all his
blessings and benefits that are upon us. For Fifthly Thanksgiving.
therefore Moses declares in the first of Genesis, how God made the Heaven and
the Earth, the Sun and the Moon, and all things here below; To show that if
we have any comfort in any thing in this world, God the Creator is to be
blessed, and thanked for it, 1 Thessalonians 5. 18.

Q. Is it enough to thank God for his mercies?

A. Surely no; but as we are thankful for his blessings, so we must be
thankful for his judgments too, and therefore we must bless God, as well for
our poverty as we do for our plenty; as well for our weakness, as we do for
our strength: as well when we lose our comforts, as when we have them, Job 1.
21.

Q. What is the Reason that so few are thankful for their troubles?

A. Because men are not able to look through the present evils that are upon
them, into the special favor and love of God, who by this means compasses
and procures their greater good. And therefore men think it an unreasonable
thing, that they should thank God for the loss of their wealth, of their
peace, of their liberty, and the like, because they see not into that good,
which the Lord by this means will bring upon them, Romans 5. 4.

Q. How may we provoke our selves to thankfulness?

A. First, if we keep a faithful Register of the blessings of God, and
engraue them (as it were) upon the gates of the soul, that we may behold in
one sight, and in one view, all the rich blessings of God, that are upon us,
Psalm 103, 1. 2. etc.

Secondly, if we consider how unworthy we are of the least of those blessings
which we enjoy: For we are not worthy the earth should bear us; the heavens
should cover us: the Sun should shine upon us. And therefore it is the Lords
exceeding favor that we are blessed in any measure, and regarded of him, 2.
Sam. 7. 18.

Thirdly, if we consider our preferment in many of our blessings above other
men, and how they are thankfuller for half our happiness, then we are for the
whole, Math. 13. 17.

Fourthly, if we consider how the number of Gods blessings grows daily
toward us. So that if we had cause to thank God yesterday; we have greater
cause to thank him to day. And if we have cause to thank him this year, we
shall have greater to thank him the next year; the Lords mercy still more and
more increasing on us, Ezekiel. 36. 11.

Q. What is the last Point of Godliness?

A. The sanctifying of the Sabbath, which is one of the chiefest Sabbath.
duties of a Christian, as being the very sinnewe, and the life of all the
rest: For though a man be never so sick and diseased; yet so long as he lies
at Physic, and uses good means of health, there is some hope he may do
well; but when he lets his disease run, and will not come under the
Physicians hands, then his case is desperate, we have little hope that he
will ever mend. Even so, though a man be never so sick and diseased in his
soul: yet so long as he has care to sanctify the Sabbath, to partake in the
holy Prayers, and the Ministry of the Church, there is some hope that in time
these good things may work upon him: But if he will not come to join in these
exercises of the Church: if he have no care to hear, to pray, to meditate and
the like; then his state is woeful, we have little hope of amendment, Isay 38.
13. 14.

Q. How must we sanctify the Sabbath?

A. First, in setting our selves apart from our worldly businesses, that we may
with greater liberty, bestow our selves in the service of God: And therefore
it is not lawful to journey about our worldly matters upon the Sabbath day,
Exodus 16. 29.

Secondly, it is not lawful to keep Fayres or Markets on the Sabbath, Nehem.
13. 13. 16. 17.

Thirdly, it is not lawful to sow or reap, or to load our cart, or to weed
in our corn on the Sabbath, Exodus 14. 21.

Fourthly, it is not lawful to buy or sell bargains upon the Sabbath, Nehem.
10. 31.

Q. Whom does this Doctrine meet withal?

A. First, it condemns those, that take up that day for their worldly
affairs, and many times cast the greatest burden of their business upon the
Sabbath.

Secondly, it condemns those, who though they rest from their labors
outwardly; yet notwithstanding they have their heads and their hearts so
fraught with worldly matters, that indeed they do not perform the tenth of
the Sabbath, Amos 8. 5.

Qu. Are all works forbidden on the Sabbath?

A. Not all, but such only as be lets and hindrances to the Sabbath. And
therefore we learn Math. 12. That three sorts of works are lawful on the
Sabbath.

Qu. What are they?

A. First, works of necessity, as if our enemies invade us, it is lawful to
repulse them. If our house be on fire, it is lawful to quenchit. If a gappe be
made into our corn or pasture, it is lawful to mend it, Math, 12. 3. 4.

Secondly, works of holiness, such as lend their helps to the Sabbath: As a
man may go forth on the Sabbath day to preach, by the example of Christ, Math.
12. 9. or to hear a Sermon by the example of the Noble women in the 2. Kings
4. 23.

Thirdly, Works of mercy, as a man may dress his meat, and pull his beast
out of the pit, and minister unto a sick body upon the Sabbath day, Math. 12.
11. 12,

Q. What is the other thing wherein we must sanctify the Sabbath?

A. In practicing the holy Exercises of the Sabbath; And therefore they that
rest from their labors, and yet are not careful to sanctify the Sabbath in
the holy duties thereof, do not indeed truly keep a Sabbath to the Lord,
Exodus 3. 2. 3.

Qu. What are the exercises of the Sabbath?

A. They are of two sorts, Some are Public, and Some are Private.


Q. What are the public Exercises of the Sabbath?

A. The first is hearing of the word of God with fear and reverence, Nehem. 8.
3. to the 9.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they which either loyter at home: or when they come, either gaze, or
sleep, or read, when they should hear, do not indeed sanctify a Sabbath
unto the Lord.

Q. What if they have no Preacher in the town where they dwell?

A. Yet they must seek abroad, as the little bird leaves her warm nest, and
flies for her food where she can get it: So must they by the famous example of
the Noble woman in the 2. Kings 4. And also of the Queen of the South, Math.
12. 14.

Qu. What is the second Exercise of the Sabbath?

A. Thanksgiving to God for his many and geeat blessings bestowed upon us all
the week before, together with earnest prayer for the continuance of the same
all the next week, and ever after Acts 16. 13.

Qu. What gather we of this?

A. That they which think it enough to be at the Sermon, and withdraw
themselves from the Prayers of the Church, do not Sanctify the Sabbath in all
the duties of it.

Q. Are none else faulty in this point?

A. Yes, even they also, which run out before the end of the exercise,
turning up the heels to God and departing, before the Lord give them liberty
to depart, Ezekiel. 46. 10.

Q. What example have we of this?

A. Matthew 26. 30. We read that the Disciples of Christ went not out, till
the Psalm was sung, only Judas was so hotly set upon his business, that we
could not tarry the Psalm, John 13. 30. 31.

Q. What is the third Exercise of the Sabbath?

A. Receiving of the Lords Supper at the appointed times, and attending to
Baptism, if occasion serves, that thereby we may be brought in better
remembrance of the vow and promise, which we have made to God, and also lend
our helps too in prayer to the little Babe then presented to the Church, Act.
20. 7.

Q. What are the private exercises of the Sabbath?

A. They are of two sorts, 1. Such as prepare us to the public duties of the
Sabbath. 2. Such as must be performed afterward.


Q. What are the Exercises in the holy Preparation of the Sabbath?

A. Private prayer, that the Lord will fit and enable us to the sanctifying of
the Sabbath, so that we may reverently attend unto the ministry of the word,
and the prayers of the Church, and profit thereby, and that God will be the
mouth of our Minister, that he may speak with grace and power to the hearts of
the hearers, Eccles. 4. 17.

Secondly, Rising early, and making the shorter meals that we may have the
more time to bestow in private prayer, and be the more cheerful in the rest
of the exercises that are behind, Psalm. 119. 148.

Q. What is the equity of this Duty?

A. That if we cut short our sleep, when our own bus^nesse is in hand, much
more should we do for the Lords: and if we cannot make a good meal when we
have a worldly matter in hand, much less should we dwell upon our dishes, when
the glory and honor of God calls us from them.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That their sin is very great, who being content to rise early all the
rest of the week, yet give themselves to sloth and sluggishnesse exceedingly
upon the Sabbath day, bewraying thereby their profane and worldly mind, that
they carry more good will to their own business, then they do to the Lords.

Q. What are the private duties of the Sabbath, after we have been at Church?

A. A joyful thanksgiving to God for the gracious and good things, that we
have heard, blessing the Lord in our souls, that it has pleased him to pour
out his whole heart unto us in the ministry of the Word, and to reveal those
things in our days, which many years have been shut up and sealed from the
world, Nehem. 8. 12.

Qu. What learn we by this?

A. That as John says Revel. 5. 4. That he wept much when the Book was
sealed, and no man was found to open it: So men should weep to see the Book
of God lie clasped in their Churches, and no man (to open it and) expound it to
them.

Qu. What is the second private duty of the Sabbath?

A. Meditation, and beating over by our selves that which we have heard. For
this is that, which mightily strengthens the ministry of the Church, and
without which, all the preaching in the world will do us little good, Acts 17.
11. 12.

Q. What is the third private duty?

A. Conference with others when it may be had, at the least to talk in the way
of Jesus, as the Disciples, Luke 24. 17. to the 20.

Q. What is the end of Conference?

A. That others may supply that which we want, and so we may reap double fruit
of that which our selves remember, and then of that which others have learned.
If every one of us had but one coat, or but one stick upon his fire, it would
cast but a little heat: but if all we should bring our fuel together, and
lay it on one hearth, it would make a mighty blaze: So while every man
catches but a little at a Sermon, that little does him but a little good: but
if every man would bring his little, then we might make (as it were) one common
stock, we should be better able to set up and go through with Christianity,
then we do.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That their sin is exceeding great, who so soon as their backs are turned
upon the Preacher run presently into the world, and fall immediately into
speech of worldly matters, as if they had been at a Market, or a
Beare-bayting, unbeseeming the Gospel of Christ, the holiness of the day, and
the honor of the place from whence they came.

Q. What is the fourth private duty?

A. Reading of the Scriptures for the further strengthening and settling of our
faith. For if the godly Christian must read somewhat in the Bible every day,
this exercise may not in any wise belayd to sleep on the Sabbath day, Psalm. 1.
2.

Q. What is the last private duty of the Sabbath?

A. Comforting of our brethren, both relieuing them when they be in need, and
instructing them when they want instruction, Math. 12. 12.

Q. Why has the Lord appointed so many Exercises upon the Sabbath?

A. Not to burden us, and tire us out with the number of them, but to make the
Sabbath more easy for us; for how tedious would it be if we should do nothing
else but pray, or nothing else but read: But now the Lord has appointed us
variety and change of duties, that being weary in one, we might recreate and
refresh our selves in another.

Q. How long does the Sabbath last?

A. Not some few hours of the day, but the whole day, Leuit. 23. 32.

Q. What is the reason hereof?

A. Because on the Sabbath day, we are to make our provision, and to store our
selves for all the week, so that all the rest of the days may feel the
benefit and comfort of this one day, and therefore men must not think it is
some few hours, a little in the morning, and a little in the afternoon, that
will store us with all that faith, love, patence, humility, that is needful
for us: The greatest part being scant able to get up in many days so much as
will serve them for one.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they who think it enough to spend an hour in the forenoone, and an
hour in the afternoon at Church, neglecting the rest of the day, know not
what it is to sanctify a Sabbath to the benefit of their souls.

Q. If the whole day must be holy to the Lord? why then do we eat and
drink, and sleep on the Sabbath day?

A. Because these are works o^ necessity. Secondly, because they lend their
helps to the sanctifying of the Sabbath: For by sleeping in the night, and
eating in the day moderately, men are the better enabled to go through with
the duties of the Sabbeth, not being able to hold out in them, if these
comforts and refreshings should be taken from them.

Q. When does the Sabbath begin?

A. Ouer-night at the shutting in of the day, as appears evidently, Leuit.
23. 32.

Q. What is the reason hereof?

A. That the night before, might be (as it were) a preparation to the Sabbath,
both to put them in mind what they are to look for the next day, and also by
private prayer, and repeating that they heard the week before, to make them
the readier and the fitter for it.

Qu. Was not this Law particular for the Jews only?

A. No: For the Christian Churches observed it as well as the Jews, and
therefore St. Augustine in his 251. Sermon De tempore, grounding his judgment
on this place of Leuiticus, faith, Let us wholly employ our selves in the
service of God, leaving off our husbandry, and all other business from
Saturday at night, till the Lords day at night again. So long Charles the
great Emperor enacted the Lords day should be kept in French Churches, and
the Council of Torragon in the Churches of Spain, which use the Spaniards
they say hold even to this day.

Qu. Is this all that is required in the Christian life?

A. Besides these general Duties, there are many particular duties required of
us. He that is a Father, must think that he stands charged with the duties of
a Father. He that is a Master must think that the duties of a Master will be
looked for at his hands, and so of a Servant, of a Subject, and the like.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That a man must not think himself discharged, if he have walked with some
care in the general duties of a Christian; unless also he perform the same
in those particular duties, which in regard of his particular state and
calling, are laid upon him.

Q. What is the Husbands duty to the wife?

A. It is laid down in the 1. Peter 3. 7. in three points, first, he must dwell
with his wife: That is, he must live in a sweet, and lovely communion with her:
He must not absent himself more then needs: Nor make himself strange to her,
when he is at home.

Q. Whom does this Doctrine meet withal?

A. It condemns those, that upon every light occasion will be shifting from
their wives; For howsoever she sure not with thee, yet thou must remember,
that she is the companion of thy life, whom God and thy own choice has joined
to thee, Math. 19. 16.

Secondly, it condemns those, who not settling their hearts at home, love to
be rouing, and ranging much abroad; for the Lord would not have the least
occasion of suspicion to be left to the jealous wife, and therefore has tied
the husband the more strictly to delight himself at home, Prou. 5. 18. 19.

Q. What is the second Duty?

A. First, he must dwell with her according to knowledge, knowing that God has
made the man the head of the woman, and therefore he must not lose the honor
of his place; but by wisdom, gravity, and all good advise, seek to direct
her in an honest course, Ephesians. 5. 25. 26. The husband is charged to love his
wife as Christ loved his Church: But Christ so loves his Church, that he
sanctifies it, and makes it an holy Church; and therefore the husband must so
love his wife, that he suffer her not to lie in her sins, but by all good
means seek to reclaim her, and to bring her from them.

Secondly, knowing that a woman is the weaker vessel, and therefore it is an
unreasonable thing to look for all that faith, patience, humility, discreet
and wise carriage, that they find in men.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That the wife must be supported, and borne withal in her rashness, heat,
want of discretion, and the like infirmities haunting and waiting upon the
Sex: And therefore every advantage must not be taken against her, but we must
break through many discour^esies, and many wrongs to hold love and friendship
with her.

Q. What is the third Duty?

A. He must give honor unto her, as unto the weaker vessel.

Q. What is meant by this?

A. He must have her in good reckoning and in good regard, not dispising her
for the infirmities of her Sex, but accounting well of her for the graces
whatsoever that are in her, esteeming her as a vessel, as one needful and
necessary in the house.

Secondly, he must provide for her the best he can, he must not set over her
the whole care of his provision; but as she is the weaker vessel, so he must
think in the maintenance of the Family to be assisted more weakly by her.

Q. What is the Wives duty to her husband? Wives.


A. She must be subject to her husband, humbling her self to the yoke of
government, which God has laid upon her. For God has made the man the head of
the woman, and therefore this must abate all pride and self-love, and work
true honor in her heart toward him whom God has made the chief in the
house, 1. Pet. 3. 1.

Qu. How it this further declared?

A. That the husband is Gods deputy, and Gods Lieutenant in the house, as
Christ is in the Church, and therefore to despise the husband is to despise
God; to disobey the husband in lawful things, is to disobey God, because they
lift up themselves against the power, which God has placed in his own steed
and room, Ephesians. 5. 22.

Q. Why does the Scripture beat so much upon this duty?

A. Because there is a secret swelling in the heart which will hardly brook
the government of the man, especially, if in any good qualities they go beyond
him.

Q. How must this subjection be declared?

A. Both by reverend speech, and all humble behavior to her husband. Some take
it to be their grace to speak rudely and bluntly to him. But it was Sarahs
honor that she obeyed Abraham and called him Lord, 1. Pet. 3. 5.

Q. What is the reason hereof?

A. A man is bound to love his wife, though there be nothing in her that
deserves love; But because a man is not easily brought to this love, where
there is not some cause of love: Therefore the Lord would have the wife by
gentle and sweet behavior, deserve, and win love at her husbands hands.

Q. What is the second Duty of the wife?

A She must be of pure conversation; no hauocker, no waster of her husbands
goods, no inticer of him to dishonest things, like Jobs wife, that was Jobs
tempter, not idle, not sluggish, no babbler abroad of her husbands faults, Prou.
31. 10. 11.

Q. What is the third duty?

A. She must fear her husband, and she must be loath to displease him, such
a tender care she must have of his comfort, and of his peace, that she must not
do willingly the least thing, that may displease him, Ephesians. 5. 23.

Qu, What is the fourth Duty?

A. She must not be proud and costly in her attire, stretching out her self
to all that she may, but keeping under her husbands ability, rather then any
whit above it, 1. Pet. 3. 3.

Q. What is the fifth Duty?

A. She must entertain no secret dislike of her husband, but rest her mind
with all contentment in him, ever pleasing her self in her husbands face,
Cant. 5. 9. 10.

Q. What is the last Duty?

A. She must be of a meek and an humble spirit, nor given to cursing,
brawling, fretting and fuming with him, but by meekness and love support him
in his hastiness, rashness, and other infirmities, which he has. 1. Pet. 3.
3.

Q. What is the Parents duty to their children? Parents.


A. They must bring them up in the fear of God; they must seek to place
religion and true godliness in their hearts: They must not only train them up
to live ciuilly, and honestly in the world: But their chiefest care must be to
acquaint them in their tender years with the ways of God, Ephesians. 6. 4.

Qu. What is the second Duty?

A. They must not be churlish and bitter to them, moping them too much, but
living with some cheerfulness among them, Col. 3. 21.

Qu. What is the third Duty?

A. They must not let their Children run out, but hold them in and correct
them moderately for their faults, for better the Parents by discreet correction
make their children weep, then their children through their ungracious
behavior, make their aged Parents weep, and lay down their hoarie heads with
sorrow in the grave, Prou. 19. 18.

Qu. What is the fourth Duty?

A. They must consecrate such as be fit unto the Lord, as Anna did Samuel,
bestowing the rest in some honest Trades, so that none be suffered to lie idle
upon their hands.

Qu. What is the fifth Duty?

A. Mothers must nurse their children at their own breasts, for even the
Estredges in the Wilderness draw out their breasts unto their young, and
proffer food, but then there leave their eggs to be hatched by another, Genesis
21. 7.

Q. What is the sixth Duty?

A. When their children be ready, they must be careful to match them with men
of understanding and such asfeare God: They must chiefly look not how rich
they be, how personable they be, but how godly they be.

Qu. Is it not lawful for a Christian to match with a Jew?

A. No, for this is amping of the holy seed, and a wilful flinging of our
selves into a continual temptation; a lugging of ourselves with a continual
yoke.

Q. What is the seventh Duty?

A. They must so labor, and care moderately for outward things, that when they
depart this life, they may leave some blessing amongst their seed.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That their sin is great, who live so riotously and so idly, that they
be able to leave no means to their children when they dye.

Q. What is the Childrens duty to the Parents? Children.


A. They must seek the honor of their Parents, Math. 15. 4. first so to
behave themselves, as that their Parents may have credit by them: For a good
child is an honor to the parent: but he that is evil is the shame of them
that has brought them up.

Q. How must we honor our Parents?

A. By making good account of them, and using them reuerendly with all
humbleness and fear, Leu. 19. 3.

Q. What if the Parent be a meaner man?

A. Yet the child must perform him that reverence and honor that is his due;
Though a King should not be the wisest, nor the grauest, nor the learned man
in the kingdom; yet because the Lord has stated him in his royal Throne,
therefore they that are grauer and wiser, and learneder then he must bow before
him. So though the Parents in many things come short of their children: yet in
that they are their Parents, they have their honor and their excellency above
them, Genesis 48. 12.

Qu. What learn we from hence?

A. That Parents must keep the dignity of their place, and look for due
reverence at their childrens hands, as Jacob though but a shepherd, yet was
well content that Joseph his son should bow before him.

Q In what else must we honor our Parents?

A. In being obedient to them and performing their wills, both when they be
alive and when they be dead, so far forth as lawfully we may, especially in
the weighty matter of Marriage, which may not be dealt in without their
consent, Prou. 23. 22.

Q. Who are they that are condemned hereby?

A. Such as make light of their Parents, doing all upon brain, never caring
for their counsel or consent, Prou. 30. 17.

Q. What is the best thing wherein we must honor our Parents?

A. In maintaining and relieuing them in comfortable sort according to our
ability, when they be in need, 1. Tim. 5. 8.

Q. What is the reason hereof?

A. We have received much more at our Parents hands, and they did but trust us
with their wealth till themselves were old, and therefore we cannot in any
equity, but render and repay them their own when they be in need, 1. Tim. 5. 4.

Qu. Are these duties to be performed to our own Parents only?

A. They belong also to our Parents in law. Christ was obedient to his
stepfather Joseph, Luke 2 5. And Micah notes it, as one of the sins of the
People ca. 7. 6. That the daughter in law set up her self against her Mother
in law; a sin too common in these woeful days.

Q What is the Masters duty to their servants? Masters.


A. They must teach them religion, and the fear of God, that their servants
may continue the Lords worship when our selves are in the grave. For why is the
Centurion said to fear the Lord with all his house, Acts 10. 2. but to teach
us, that it is not enough to be godly our selves, or to have one good Servant
like a Joseph in the house: but it must be our care that all within our gates,
and under our power and authority may fear the Lord, Genesis 18. 19.

Q. How may masters be stirred up to some care of this duty?

A. If they consider, That their own good, and their own welfare is procured
thereby; for many a master is blessed for his godly servant, as Potipher was
for Joseph; and he fares every day in the week the better for him. But where
bad servants be, there falls the curse of God for the servants sake, Genesis 39. 5.

Q. But what if the Master teach, and the Servants will not learn?

A. If the Master do his faithful endeavor, his conscience is discharged: Man
can but persuade, it is God only that must change the heart. Noah preached to
his own family, as well as to the old world, 120 years, and yet when the
godly man entered into the Arc, he had not one godly servant after all his
pains that would enter with him. So Lot was a just and a righteous man, and
that had care of his house; yet when he was called out of Sodom, he had not one
servant in all his house, that would go out of Sodom with him.

Q What is their second duty to their servants?

A. T^y must cause them to live peaceably and honestly toward m^^, not bearing
them out in their wrongs, but brideling and remaining them the best they can,
1. Sam. 22. 2. with 1. Sam. 25. 7.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That as David's servants were the better for his service, so we should seek
to make our servants not the worse, but the better for our houses. For what a
fearful saying will it be at the judgment day, In such a man's service I took
my bane, I may curse the hour that ever I came into his house, there were my
righteousness wounded, and all my graces taken from me.

Q. What is their third duty to their servants?

A. They must not ouer-labour their servants, laying more upon them than their
strength will bear. A man would be loath to ouer-worke his beast; how much
more his servant, in whose face he may see the image of God shining, as well
as in his own, Job 31. 13.

Q. What is their fourth duty?

A. They must pay them truly for their pains, for the labourer is worthy of
his hire, 1. Tim. 5. 10.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That their sin is great, who send away their servants empty after all
their toil. Laban is the pattern that such men may be painted by: they can
well be content, that their servants should labor and toil, and spend out
their hearts and strength in their service; but care not though they go away
without one hal^epenie for their pains, Deuteronomy. 11. 13. 14.

Q What is their fifth duty?

A. They must chasten them with discretion and moderation for their faults: for
the Lord would not have the servants life by any hard dealing of ours to be
made wearisome and bitter to them. We read of furious Saul, That his spirit was
mastring at any little word: and of Nabal, so fierce that a man could not
speak to him. To the like reproach of those that will hear nothing when they
be in heat, but let every thing fly that first comes to their hands, Leu. 25.
49. How many blessings did Laban lose, only by entreating a good servant ill?
This makes our Servants, even the Jewels of our house, weary of our service.

Q. How may they keep a moderation in their punishments?

A. If they look that the cause be just. Secondly, That the punishment be
equal as may be to the offense, keeping under it rather then any whit above
it, Deuteronomy. 25. 2. 3.

Q. What is their sixth Duty to them?

A. They must wink at many slippes, and pass by many faults through love. For
if the Master should take the forfeit of every offense; he shall never live in
any peace, but vex himself more then his servants that offend him, Eccles. 7.
23.

Q. What reason is there to move us to this?

A. As they are servants under us; so we are servants to a greater Lord.
Wherefore, if we would not have God take us at advantage for every sin, we
must not take our servants short for every fault, Ephesians. 6. 9.

Q. What is their last Duty to their servants?

A. They must esteem best of their best servants, accounting of every one
according to that trust and faithfulness, that they find in them, as
Cornelius cast special favor on that soldier that feared God, making him his
Jewel and treasure above the rest, Acts 10. 7.

Qu. What is the servants duty to their Masters? Servants.


A. Servants must be obedient to their Masters not their own men, but living
wholly at their beck and at their command, as the Centurion says to his
servant, come, and he comes; So when we say to our servants, come, they must
come, etc. Ephesians. 6. 9.

Qu. What is their second Duty?

A. Servants must be diligent to please their Masters, having a tender care,
that nothing may slip through their fingers, which may offend them: They must
seek even to fit themselves to them (so far forth) as they may with an
unstained Conscience to the honor, and not whole dishonor of their Masters
with whom they dwell, Tit. 2. 9.

Qu. What reason is there to stir them up to this?

A. In serving their Masters they serve the Lord Christ. And therefore if a man
would be ashamed to serve Christ slothfully, or idly, or grudgingly, he must
be ashamed to serve his Master so, his Master being but Christ's deputy, and
Lieutenant in the house, Col. 3. 24.

Qu. What is their third Duty?

A. They must not murmr, nor answer again, when they be reproved, but in
silence and patience commend their cause to God, Tit. 2. 9.

Q. What is their fourth Duty?

A. They must not filtch or purloyne the least point or pin, nor make
havoc, and spoil of their meat, or of any thing else that comes into their
hands, Ioh. 6. 12.

Q. What is the fifth Duty?

A. Servants must show all good faithfulness to their Masters, discharging
their places with all trust in the places committed to them; not beseeming
themselves, whiles their Masters are in sight, and proclayming looseness and
liberty when they are gone, but carrying themselves with as great trustiness
in their absence, as if they were present with them, Ephesians. 6. 5. 6.

Q. What reason is there to bring them to this?

A. To consider, that that which they hide from their Masters they cannot hide
from God; for though their Masters see them not, yet God looks upon them from
heaven with a bright and a shining eye, and he sees them maintaining and
gaming, and trifling out their time: and therefore when their Masters back is
turned, they must still think the Lords back is not turned upon them, Heb. 4.
13.

Q. What is their sixth Duty?

A. Servants must tender the credit of their Masters, burying their private
faults within the private walls, by no means publishing the secricies of the
house, no not then, when they are departed from them, 1. Prou. 11. 13.

Q. What is their last Duty?

A. They must settle themselves in their service, and not upon every light
displeasure be flitting to a new. A good servant is not then going every day;
but is sometimes 20. years in a place together, as Jacob was: But now in 20
years, the greatest part will have 20. services by their Wills, Genesis 16. 8. 9.

Q. What general reasons are there to edge them on to these Duties?

A. Christian servants must so behave themselves, that they may be an honor to
the Gospel, that as Potipher was glad of Joseph: So men may say, there are no
such servants as the servants of Christ for faithfulness, care, and diligence,
and honesty, they may carry the torch unto all the rest, 1. Tim. 6. 7.

Q. What is the Duty of those that be in office?

A. They must be men of courage, they must not let every Officers.
bold-face dash them, and bear them down, but stoutly oppose themselves to
the discontinuancing of every disorder that reigns, Deuteronomy. 1. 17.

Q What gather we of this?

A. That as men wish all things were well, so they must have courage for the
truth to oppose themselves against all those that be hinderers of their goods,
Ier. 9, 3.

Q. What is their second Duty?

A. They must be men fearing God, and therefore they must make a conscience of
their Calling, and be content rather to displease their dearest friend then to
displease the Lord; rather to lose men's favors then Gods: rather the whole
world should frown, then God should frown upon them, 2. Chron. 19. 9.

Q. What is the reason hereof?

A. Because this is a great damping, and a great cooling to them that are in
place, they dare not execute their office lest men should be angry with them,
and therefore Gods fear must be opposed, as a brazen buckler to the fear of
men: to think that as men will be angry if we do it; so God will be angry if
we do it not: as men will vex us, if we press it; so God will vex us and
be terrible and fearful to our souls if we press it not. And who art thou
that fear the face of men, and fear not the face of the mighty God, who
is able with one blast of his mouth to blow thee into hell, and with the least
touch of his finger to fling down the pillars of heaven and earth about thine
ears, Job 32. 22.

Qu. What is their third Duty?

A. They must be men hating covetousness, they must not be so greedily set
upon their gain, that they will spare neither time nor money to discharge
their duties. But they must be content many times to pass over all regard of
themselves, and even to let their own business sleep, that the causes of God
and the people may be set on foot, Exodus 18. 21.

Qu. What is their fourth Duty?

A. They must not be ready to do all upon a brain, but in matters of moment,
and beyond their reach be glad to advise with those that be wiser and
skilfuller then themselves, Exodus 18. 22.

Q. What is their last Duty?

A. They must apply themselves to their office, that is, ever set, and buckle
themselves to perform the duties of it, Heb. 12. 2.

Qu. What learn we by this?

A. That they have much to answer for, who being chosen to the offices of a
Town, sleep in them, and slubber them over they care not how, as if
Magistracy were a chair of ease.

Q. What is the duty of Private men?

A. They must make choice of fit and able men to rule among Subjects.
them, Deuteronomy. 1. 13.

Qu. What gather we of this?

A. That it is a great sin to cast our offices we care not where, never
regarding the fitness and ability of the parties that we name. So we set up
officers in the Church like scarre^rowes in a field, Idol officers like Idol
sheepheards; That have eyes and see not, ears and hear not, mouths and
speak not against any thing that is amiss.

Qu. What is their second Duty?

A. They must not shift out themselves from the offices of the Commonweal, or
of the Church, finding some reasonable fitness in themselves to discharge
them: For what is this, but to bury our Talent in a napkin, and deprive our
being of all the benefit and comfort of our graces, Phil. 2. 14.

Q. What is their last Duty?

A. They must reverence and regard those, whom God has placed in office and
authority, though otherwise in many respects inferior to them, Acts 24. 5.

Q. What is the duty of the Pastor of the Church?

A. He must approve himself both to his own conscience, Pastors.
and to the judgment of others to be the Minister of God, 2. Cor. 6. 8.

Q. What is the Duty of the People to their Pastors?

A. They must seek to have a godly and a good Minister People.
placed amongst them.

Q. How must we seek it?

A. By prayer unto God, that he will raise up faithful and good Pastors to
his people, Math. 9. 38.

Q. What gather we by this?

A. That their fault is exceeding great, who content themselves with that weak
ministry which they have, are not often upon their knees, and do not labor
careful in their places to set up a sufficient and an able man among them.

Q. What is their second Duty?

A. They must pray for their good Ministers, that God would pour grace into
their lips, and wisdom into their hearts, that they may speak the word
faithfully and feelingly to the people. For as when Moses hands fell down,
Aaron and Hur helped to bear them up: So when the good Moseses of our land wax
weary in their labors, and are out of heart; by the Prayers of Gods people,
they must be strengthened in their Ministry and cheared up again, Col. 5. 3. 4.

Q. What is their third Duty?

A. They must love the Ministers of the Word, and that not with ordinary and
common love, such as they bestow upon every one; But with singular love above
the rest, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 13.

Q. What is the reason hereof?

A. Men love them best, which wish them best: But none wish us more good then
the good Ministers; For they would have us to be all saved; to be Kings in the
new Jerusalem, and to sit crowned in glory with Christ upon his throne, for
this they labor, and watch and spend their strength, caring more for us then
we care for our selves, and therefore they deserve to be loved in an high
degree, Gal. 4. 15.

Q. What is their fourth Duty?

A. They must reverence the Ministers of the Gospel, having them in good
reckoning, and in good regard, not accounting of them, as the profane sort
do, as of the basest and meanest in the world, Leu. 21. 8. 2. Cor. 3. 9.

Q. What Ministers are most to be esteemed?

A. Ministers are more or less to be accounted of according to the benefit,
which the Church receives by them. And likewise, they are to be had in
greatest regard, who have labored most for the profiting of the people, 2.
Cor. 11. 23.

Q. What are the helps and means to continue us in this good course?

A. The first help, is diligence, when a man bestirs himself in goodness,
and pursues religion even at the heels, laboring Helps to a Holy life.
in it notably, and sweating about his soul. And therefore 1 Diligence.
Christianity is commonly compared to an Occupation or a Trade, because there
is no good to be done in it, unless it be thoroughly applied, 2. Pet. 1. 10.

Q. What is the reason hereof?

A. Because a man goes no further in Christianity, then he drives forward his
soul, and luggs it on. And therefore if he once slack his pains; let him
look also that his love, and his zeal will quickly slake.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That they who content themselves with a cold profession of the Gospel, and
to go along in Religion for company sake, and do not gird their loins, and
set themselves unto it seriously, shall never attain to any soundness in it,
Prou. 13. 4.

Q. What is the second Help? 2 Graces nourished.


A. To nourish our graces, and to plie the fire of the Spirit, that it go not
out so soon as we feel any declyning of our state, as coldness in prayer,
deadness of heart, wear^nesse in good duties; not to let the disease to grow,
but immediately to labor the reforming of it, Heb. 12. 13.

Q. Declare this more fully?

A. As a man feeling the grudging of an Ague, seeks to meet with it, and to
prevent it before it come: So when we feel any declyning of our state, a fit
and a pang of sin, we must gather up our selves from that weariness and
deadness, and coldness that is grown upon us.

Q. What is the third Help? 3 To watch our Life.


A. To set a watch over all our life: to look that we speak nothing, but what
God would have us speak, and that we think nothing, but that which God would
have us think and do. And that we have the Lords word, and the Lords Warrant
for every thing that we take in hand, Psalm. 39. 1.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they who let their lives run at random, they care not how, and do
not first consider before they do any thing, what God would have them do; and
before they deal in any business, how God would have them deal; and before
they say any thing, what God would have them say, must needs offend exceedingly.

Q. What is the fourth Help? 4 Daily Trial.


A. To try our state daily; how we come forward, what gain we make, and
whether our profit be answerable to our time, and to our Ministers pains, how
sin dies in us, what corruptions are yet strong, and what pains we take
for the weakening of them; This will comfort us and encourage us forward, if we
have done well, and make us ashamed of our sloth, if we be not the better by
our means, 2. Cor. 13. 5.

Q. What is the fifth Help? 5 Scriptures reading.


A. Reading of the Scriptures privately as often as we can, though it be the
less, and that which we want at one time to supply it another, so that we be
constant in our course, Josh. 1. 8.

Q. How may we read the Scriptures with profit?

A. First, if we remember it is God that speaks in the How to read with
profit.
Scripture, and therefore when we open the Bible, we do open the mouth of the
blessed God to speak unto us; So that when we come to read, we may say as
Samuel says, Speak Lord for thy servant hears, 2. Pet. 1. 21.

Secondly, if we think that God comes not to talk with us of trifles, for
this beseems not the Majesty of God; but he comes to speak with us of
matters of great moment, and of great weight, of such as concern the
everlasting welfare of our souls, and therefore we are to quicken up our
selves in the hearing of him, Deuteronomy. 32. 47.

Thirdly, if we think that there is never a word that God speaks in vain,
but it has something for our instruction and good, if we could take it; And
therefore when we read without profit, we may say; Lord, that God should
talk so long with my soul, and I never the better for it, Romans 15. 4.

Fourthly, if we apply the Scriptures to our selves, not reading them as
strange stories that concern us not: But to think that we shall find him the
same God to us in our troubles, prayers, sins, and repentance, which Abraham,
and David and Job, and Jacob have found him before us, Iam. 5. 11.

Fifthly, if we insist, and dwell longest upon those places which meet most
with our corruptions.

Sixthly, if we meditate of it afterward, and lay up that which we
understand, and ask of that which we do not, Acts 8. 34. Praying to make it
profitable.

Qu. What is the sixth Help?

A. To read twice or thrice in a week, as our leisure will 6 Marking
Particulars.
afford those places of Scripture, which concern our particular calling; to
consider with what faithfulness we have walked in the duties that are there
commanded. As he that is a servant to peruse those Scriptures, that lay down
the duty of a Servant: and he that is a Master those places that describe the
duties of a Master. This will be a great advantage to godliness, to have the
Lord so often calling us, and ringing duty continually in our ears, Deuteronomy. 17.
18. 19.

Qu. What is the seventh Help?

A. To be always meditating on good things, and set the 7 Meditation on good
things.
mind on work in holy thoughts, especially to consider the cursed estate of
the wicked to avoid it, and the happy estate of the godly, and to be
heartened to the like, Psalm. 119. 97.

Q. What difference is there between the state of the godly, and of the wicked.

A. Great difference while they live, but greater when they die: For the godly
die like lambs, they make a sweet close: they fall asleep in the arms of
Christ; Whereas the wicked die like hogs, that go grunting and whyning to
their death: so they struggle for life, and stick to the world, and are loath
to die. Numb. 23. 10.

Q. What is the eighth Help? 8. Affliction Sanctified.


A. To make an holy use of our Troubles, to remember they are as whippes in the
hand of God to scourge us home to him, Psalm. 119. 67.

Qu. How is this declared?

A. By a Similitude: For if a sheep run from his fellows, the shepherd
sets forth his dog after him, yet not meaning to weary the sheep but to hunt
him home to the flock again. So when we wander astray away from God, the
great sheepeheard of our souls sets out his dog after us, sometimes poverty,
sometimes sickness, sometimes dearth of corn to chase us from our sins, and
to drive us to God again.

Qu. What is the ninth Help?

A. To bring our selves often in rememberance of the vows 9 Remembrance of vows
and Covenants.
and covenants which we have made with God, and to call upon our selves for the
performing of them: For if it be dishonest to break with men, how much more if
we shall not keep touch with God, Psalm. 66. 13. 14.

Q. What is the tenth Help? 10 Communion of Saints.


A. To use the company of the godly, that we may be the better by it, Psalm.
119. 63.

Q. What good is gotten by it?

A. First, We are thereby provoked to be like them: As Saul a wicked man
falling into the company of the Prophets, and seeing how godly they spent their
time, was made ashamed of his own life, and began to prophecy with them, 1.
Sam. 19. 24.

Secondly, we have our benefit in all their gifts; we are the wiser for their
wisdom, and their zeal kindles ours, as one candle lights another, Prou. 13.
20.

Thirdly, we are thereby kept in some compass, and our corruptions nipt in the
head, that they dare not stir, Josh. 24. 31.

Fourthly, we fare the better many times for their sakes; God revealing that to
them, which he would not have done to us, 2. Kings 3. 14.

Qu, What is the eleventh Help?

A. To withstand and avoid all the lettes which may stop and hinder us in our
Christian courses, be it pleasure or profit, 11 Withstanding Lettes.
or company or friend, away with every thing that may hinder us from Christ,
Math. 5. 29.

Q. What is the last Help?

A. To bring this to every days practice, that our whole 12 Daily Practice.
life may be nothing else, but a walking with God, and a continual iourneying
toward our heavenly home, 1. Tim. 4. 7.

Q. What is required in the daily Practice?

A. First a certain Preparation to the day, and then the holy spending of the
day it self.

Q. Why is the Preparation needful?

A. Because as a man in time of a common plague takes somewhat in the morning
next his heart to keep out the infection; So the world being mightily poisoned
with sin, the Christian must lay some good thing next his heart, else every
thing that he deals in will infect him, Psalm. 119. 148.

Q. What is the first thing wherewith we must begin the day?

A. We must seek to awake with God, to have our minds Daily Practice how?
running on him, as soon as we look up; For we cannot awake so soon, but
with Gods Blessing, and Gods Mercyes be up before us: And therefore let God be
in the beginning of our thoughts, and let him have the first place in the day,
Mark 1. 35.

Q. What are we then to consider of?

A. That we have slept more sweetly under the Lords defense, then if we had
had Iron walls, and Brazen doors to defend us: When we were fast asleep and
could not watch our selves; then the Lord watched over us, and he set a guard
of Angels to keep us. And therefore seeing we have rested with such safety
under Gods defense, let us thank him for his mercy, and seek to diue under
the wing of the Almighty, and to go shadowed with the hand of his protection
all the day, Psalm. 17. 8.

Qu. What are we to consider else?

A. That we rise the servants of God, as we went to bed; and therefore that
we must spend the day in his service, not in doing what we list, but in
performing those duties that he requires. For seeing this is the cause why we
were borne, and why God lets us live here in this world, that we may serve
him: We are to think every morning when we rise, that God lets us live one
day more, but to have one days service more at our hands: and if he let us
live another day, it is but to have another days service at our hands.
Therefore, as our servants get up to do our business, so must we rise to do
the Lords, 1. Cor. 15. 34.

Qu. What are we to do then?

A. Then we are to take a view of our work, to cast in our heads, what are the
days wherein we must spend the day; The consideration of our own state and
calling will soon lead us to this; For many times we are to think, I am a
Christian, and therefore I must spend this day like a Christian; I am a Father,
and therefore I must peforme the duties of a Father: I am a Preacher or a
Master or a Servant, etc. Luke 14. 28.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That it is not possible for those simple souls to live well, which know
not what are the particular duties which their own place and calling require
at their hands. For how can they spend the day Christian-like, that know not
what Christianity means? And how can they live like Fathers, that know not
what belongs to the duty of a father? And therefore every one that will live
well, must have at his fingers ends the draft of duties mentioned before,
Ephesians. 4. 18.

Qu. And may we then safely enter upon the day?

A. No in no wise, till our spiritual furniture be on, and we have taken unto
us the whole armor of God, without the which we enter into the world like a
naked man into the field: And therefore when our clothes go on, then let us
remember to put on our virtues to, Ephesians. 6. 13.

Q. What are the parts of this Armor?

A. The Parts are 6.

First, Sincerity, and a faithful and a true heart to God, Daily Armor.
that we make not show of more then we have, but seek that our inward care,
zeal, love of God, may be answerable to that which we outwardly profess.

Secondly, Righteousness, and an upright and honest mind to our brethren,
that whatsoever of theirs shall come into our hands, shall pass in peace and
safety as good as it came.

Thirdly, Preparation for afflictions, to be ready to lay down our lives and
all we have at the feet of Christ, and to undergo patiently those troubles
which the evil of these evil days shall cast upon us.

Fourthly, Faith, to persuade our selves, that God is at peace with us in
Christ, and therefore that he will bless us, and be with us in all our pains.

Fifthly, Knowledge of Gods will, to direct us what we have to do, and to
beat back the sundry temptations that shall se^ upon us.

Sixthly, Prayer in the spirit, and fervent and earnest prayer unto God, that he
will be with us, and lead us throughout the day, and enable us by his power to
discharge in some measure, the duties that are laid upon us.

Q. Yea, but poor men will say they have no time no pray?

A. They might rather say, they have no will to pray; For they that can find
always time to eat in their greatest business, would sure find a time to
pray, if they minded God, as they mind their meat. Again, when they have
most business, it is but rising a quarter of an hour sooner. Little do they
care for Gods blessing, that will not take so little pains to have it.

Q. How is the Christian to spend the day?

A. If the day be a Sabbath day, we must set our selves wholly apart for the
Lord, we must not let any worldly business ^ay spending. Lords day.
take us up, but resort diligently to the Ministry of the word, Isay 58. 13.

Q. What are we to do as we come?

A. We are to think with our selves whether we are going: we are going into
Gods presence; into the presence of that Majesty that is greater then all the
Kings and Princes of the world; and therefore with what fear and reverence
should we come into his sight, at whose feet all the Kings in the world must
cast down their Crowns, and the Angels stand with covered faces, as not being
able to behold the excellent glory that shines in him, Eccles. 4. 17.

Q. What are we to do when we are come?

A. Then we must attend with care and conscience to the Ministry of the word of
God, remembering, that though the voice be the voice of a man: yet the word is
the word of God, and therefore we may not let it fall to the ground, but set
open all the doors of our hearts, that it may have free access, and entrance
to work upon us, 1 Thessalonians. 2. 13.

Q. What are we to do after?

A. We are to lift up our hearts with great thankfulness to God for the good
things that we have heard; and then we are to examine our selves what we have
profited, what we know now which we knew not before: what virtue is
strengthened; what vice is weakened in us, and when we go home, then we must
remember, that we talk (as the two Disciples did of Jesus Christ.) We must not
run out into the world, and speech of worldly matters, so soon as we be come
out of the Church; but then meditate with our selves, or confer with others
of that which we have heard, Acts 8. 39.

Q. What are we to do when we are come home?

A. To call our Children and our servants to account, to see what profit they
have made of the day, and to spend the rest of the day in reading and in
praying, in comforting the sick. This is to sanctify a Sabbath to the Lord.

Q. What if the day be a working day, how are we to spend it then?

A. If the day be a working day, then after prayer is performed, Week day.
we are to set upon the duties of our Calling cheerfully, and to walk in them
with such faithfulness and trust, that we may approve of our care and good
conscience, not only to men, but to the Lord himself.

Q. What is the second thing?

A. We must look that our godly care in the mean while be not laid asleep,
but even in the midst of our business, lift up our minds to God, and crave
his blessing upon every thing, that we take in hand, and many times in the day
thank him for his goodness rejoicing in him, as in the greatest portion and
treasure that we have, Prou. 3. 6.

Qu. What is the third thing?

A. Our next care must be,

Q. What is the fourth thing?

A. Care must be had, that we hurt not our brethren in their bodies, goods, or
names, or any thing belonging to them, but that we be helpefull and comfortable
to them all the ways we may; That we commend their estate by earnest prayer
unto God, that we labor for the recovering of them in their falls: that we
stir them up as we are able, to good things: that we oppress them not,
deceive them not, etc.

Q. What is the last thing?

A. For the better performing of all these duties, we are to use the means
that God has given us; as daily prayer, reading of the Scriptures: trying of
our estate, etc. And though we cannot use all these every day: yet to use so
many of them, as conveniently we may, and to add the rest as our leisure and
opportunity will afford: This is an holy and a Christian-like spending of the
day, wherein a man may rest with peace, assuring himself, that he leads a
life in some measure pleasing to God.

Q. What are we to do at night?

A. When the night is come, then we are to look back, and to mark how we
have spent the day: then we must call our selves to a reckoning, and an
account, how we walked in the duties of our Calling: then how we have behaved
our selves toward God: toward our brethren: toward our selves. If we find
that we have spent it well, then to bless God, and to thank him for it; if
not, then to be humbled by it, and to seek to God for comfort and grace, that
we may lie down in his favor, and make an end of all after-reckonings.

Qu. For further practice of Religion; What is to be done?

A. We must see what is to be believed, and practice the The Creed.
same: The sum whereof is contained in the Apostles Creed.

Q. Why is it called the Apostles Creed?

A. Not, that the Apostles made it; for then it should be Canonical
Scripture, as well as the rest of their Writings: But because it contains the
sum of the Apostles doctrine.

Q. How many parts has the Creed?

A. Two, The first treats of God. The second of the Church.


Qu. What is the sum of the Creed?

A. We profess therein, that we believe in God, distinct in three Persons,
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And that this God has gathered to
himself a Church; that is, A company of faithful people, upon whom he will
bestow his graces in this world, and the glory of his Kingdom in the world to
come.

Q. What is it to believe in God?

A. Not barely to believe that there is a God, (for the Devils do so, and
tremble,) and if this were our faith, our faith were no better then the devils
faith, and therefore to believe in God, is to put our whole trust in God, and
rest our selves upon him in all estates, to be assured in our hearts, we
shall find him a God, that is merciful and good to us in all our needs, 2.
Tim. 1. 12.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they who are clean out of heart in their troubles, be they never so
great, or seek to wind out of themselves by unlawful means, they care not
how, do not believe in God. And therefore so often as they say the Creed they
lie; because they say they Trust in him; when indeed they are not inwardly
persuaded that he will help them.

Qu. How many kinds of faith be there?

A. Two, An Historical faith, which the devils may have, Iam. 2. 19.
Secondly, Justifying or saving faith, which none but the true Christians, and
Gods elect may have, Tit. 1. 1.


Q. What difference is there between these two?

A. The devils believe that there is a God; that there is a Christ; But they
do not believe that they shall fare the better for him. Nay, they know that
heshall one day condemn them, and therefore their faith does not comfort them,
but make them the more afraid. But the Christian believing that there is a
God, that there is a Christ; believes also that he shall fare the better by
them: that God will be his God, and Christ the Savior, will be a Savior as
his Savior. And therefore this faith is so far from affrighting him, that it
comforts him exceedingly, Gal. 2. 20.

Q. Why do we say, I believe, not we believe, as we say, our Father?

A. Because our prayers may be profitable unto others. But our faith shall not
save any but our selves, Abac. 2. 4.

Q. May a man know that he has faith?

A. He may; for he that believes in God has faith: But every man, if he
would search himself and his own Faith.
heart, can tell whether he repose trust and confidence in God or no: And
therefore every man if he would search himself can tell, whether he have
faith or no, 2. Cor. 13. 1.

Q. If a Christian may be sure that he has Faith: then he may be sure of his
salvation?

A. It is true; For he that believes in the Son of God, he shall be saved,
John 3. 36. But I know that I believe in God, and therefore warranted by Gods
promise, I know that I shall besaued, 1. John 5. 13.

Q. Do not many deceive themselves in their assurance?

A. Surely many do; because they think they have faith, but when it comes to
scanning, it is not faith, but a vizard, and a shadow of it: like one that
keeps an old Evidence by him, and thinks his land is sure: But when it comes
to trial, his deed is naught, and will not carry it.

Q. How may a man know that he has true faith?

A. Two ways, By the Nature of Faith. And by the effects and fruits of it.


Q. How may a man know it by the nature of Faith?

A. If a man feel himself inwardly persuaded in his heart, that God loves him
in Christ, and because he loves him, will provide him of all things needful
both for this life, and for the life to come, so that we run not out to any
wicked and unlawful means, but rest our selves on God with contentment in all
estates. This is a sure note, that his faith is true, Job 13. 15.

Q. How may a man know it by the effects of Faith?

A. If a man have an earnest love to God, so that he be glad to do any thing
that may please him, and loath to do the least thing that may displease him.
Secondly, if he love them that love the Lord, so much the more they show the
more affection to him; This seals to his soul that his faith is true, 1.
John 3. 14.

Qu. Why do we say, I believe in God, not I believe in the Catholic Church?

A. Because we must believe in God, and in none but God, not in Saints, not in
Angels, nor in any other power, Ierem. 17. 5.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That as we believe in God, and in none but God: so we must pray to God and
to none but God. For prayer and faith be linked together: So that we may not
pray to any, in whom we may not believe, Romans 10. 14. And therefore seeing we
may not believe in the Saints, but in God alone, it is evident, that we may
not pray to any but to God alone.

Q. Who is this God in whom we believe?

A. The three Divine Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That the Turks and Jews, though they confess that there is a God: yet
because they do not confess the three divine Persons, acknowledge not the
true God: the true God being he, whom the Scriptures describe the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, 1. John 2. 23.

Q. Whose Father is God?

A. He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: And then by means of Christ, he
is our Father, Ioh. 20. 17.

Q. What is the meaning, when we say, we believe in God the Father?

A. We profess thereby, that whereas God the Father was God the Father.
displeased with us for our sins, now he is reconciled to us in the blood of
Christ, so that we dare boldly trust him with our whole state, and persuade our
selves, that as we call him Father, so we shall find him a Father, even most
tender, and fatherly affections in him.

Q. Wherein are we to persuade our selves we shall find him a father?

A. First, as a Father feeds his children, and clothes them, and prouides
things needful for them, though happily they deserve it not. So we are to
persuade our selves that God being become our gracious, and good Father in
Christ, will feed us, cloathe us, and provide for us, though we deserve it
not, Math. 6. 31.

Secondly, as a father turns not his children out of doors for every fault.
So we must not think God will cast us off for every sin, if there be any
hope of amendment in us, John. 8. 31.

Thirdly, as a father makes his son his heir, and leaves him his lands and
his living: though he keep him short and under for a time. So howsoever our
portion be but small in this world: yet we are to believe, God will make us
his heirs, and one day bestow his Crown and Kingdom on us, Luke 12. 32.

Q. What are we to believe concerning God the Father?

A. Two things, First, that he is Almighty. Secondly, that he Created Heaven
and Earth.


Q How is God said to be Almighty?

A. Two ways: first because he has all might, and all A mighty.
power in his hand, and is able to do whatsoever he will in Heaven and in
Earth, no power being able to hinder his work, and to hold out against him,
Psalm. 114. 3.

Q. God cannot do all things, for he cannot sin?

A. It is true, that God cannot do any thing that is contrary to his Nature
to do, Heb. 6. 18. he cannot lie, 2. Tim. 2. 13. he cannot deny his word,
and yet he is Almighty: Because these things imply not power, but want of power.

Q. What mean we when we say: We believe in God Almighty?

A. We believe not only that God is Almighty in himself, but that he is
Almighty for our good, and we shall feel the benefit of that Almighty, and
infinite power that is in him.

Q. What use may we make of this?

A. It serves to strengthen our faith, not only concerning the things of this
life, but also of the life to come.

Qu. How for the things of this life?

A. Seeing God is Almighty; that is, able to do all things: We know we are
never so poor, but God is able to enrich us, never so low, but God is able to
exalt us; never so heavy, but God is able to rejoice us; never so entangled,
but God is able to loose us, Romans 4 21.

Q. How for the things of the life to come?

A. Seeing God is Almighty, we know, that though our weakness be great, and
our corruptions many: yet God is able to carry us comfortably through the vast
and warring, Wilderness of this world into the land of happiness, and
eternal rest, Ioh. 10. 29.

Qu. How is God secondly said to be Almighty?

A. Because all the might and power that is in any of the creatures is from
God, the least thing in the world being not able to move it self, but by the
strength and power which it has from God.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That the Sparrow lights not on the ground: that a hair falls not from the
head: that a leaf dropps not from the tree, but it is ordered and disposed by
the mighty hand of God, Math. 20. 29. 30.

Q. Does nothing then happen by fortune and chance?

A. Surely no: these are terms brought in to rob God of his glory in the
government of the world. For ever, that which seems to be most casual, is
carried wholly by a secret hand of God, Prou. 16. 33.

Q. What use may we make of this?

A. First, it will teach us patience: For seeing all things are wrought by the
hand of God; we make our account that sickness, losses, miseries, they are all
from God, and therefore must be borne contentedly, unless in the pride of our
hearts, we will lift up our selves against the Lord, 2. Sam. 16. 10.

Qu. What is the second use?

A. It will teach us comfort; for seeing nothing is able to lift up it self
without the Lord, we are to make our account, that a dog cannot wagge his
tongue, a wicked man cannot move his hand against us without his leave and
license, who is our Father, Ioh. 19. 11.

Q. What is the third use?

A. It will teach us thankfulness: For seeing it is God that works all in
all; it is God alone, who is to be blessed for all the comforts that we have,
because it is he that enclineth men's hearts to us, and causes this or that
thing to do us good, 1. Sam. 25. 32.

Q. Why is God called the Creator of Heaven and Earth?

A. Because he made Heaven and Earth of nothing, all the Creator of Heaven and
Earth.
power in this world, being not able to work, unless it have some matter to
work upon, Heb. 11. 31.

Q. How did God Create the world?

A. We must not think that the Lord lay laboring and soyling at it, as we
see men do, when they build an house, but as Psalm 35. 6. by the word of God
were the Heavens made, etc.

Q. What is meant by Heaven and Earth?

A. By heaven is meant Heaven, and every Creature in Heaven, and by Earth is
meant the Earth, and all things in it: so that the meaning indeed is, that God
created all.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That if we have any comfort in any thing in this world; in the earth that
bears us, in the heavens that cover us: in the fire that warmes us, in the
water that cooles us: in our eyes that we see with, in our ears that we
hear with, in our legs that we go with; God alone is to be thanked and
blessed for it.

Q. Why is Heaven set before Earth?

A. Heaven is mentioned first, to teach man to seek it first, and to begin our
work at heaven, as God begun.

Q. What use may we make of this?

A. He that made all, is able to destroy all. And therefore in a moment God is
able to strip and turn the wealthiest of us out of all we have.

Q. What is the next Person we must believe in?

A. In Jesus CHRIST.

Q. What does he Creed teach us concerning Christ? And in Jesus Christ.


A. Two things, 1. What his Person is. 2. What his Office is.


His office is set our two ways, 1. By the Titles. 2. By the actions of it.


Qu. What is the first Title?

A. Jesus, which signifies a Savior, according to that, Math. 1. 21. Thou
shall call his name Jesus.

Qu. What does he save us from?

A. From sin and the punishments thereof.

Q. How does he save us from sin?

A. By delivering us from the guiltiness of sin, 1. John 17. And secondly by
freeing us from the power of sin, that it reign not in us, Ioh. 8. 24.

Q. How does Christ save us from the punishment of sin?

A. First, by delivering us from the wrath of God, that was kindled against us,
1 Thessalonians. 1. 10.

Secondly, by delivering us from the clamours and cries of our own guilty
conscience, which continually accuses us, Romans 5. 1.

Thirdly, by delivering us from the pains of Hell, Romans 8. 1.

Fourthly, by delivering us from the power of the Devil, who before ruled us
as a Lord, Heb. 2. 14.

Q. What is the meaning then of these words; I believe in Jesus?

A. The meaning is, that I believe, there is a life and Salvation in Jesus
Christ for all that come unto him: And that as he is Jesus; so I shall find
him a Jesus, that is, a Savior to save me from sin, and all the punishments
due to it: So that though I be a sinner; yet through the Spirit of Christ
working in me, I shall sin every day less then other; and through the Lords
mercy, I shall not come into condemnation for any of those sins, which
through frailty and weakness I commit.

Q. What is the second title of our Savior?

A. He is called Christ, who was anointed, and it is the same that Messiah is
in Hebrew, Ioh. 4. 25.

Q. How was Christ anointed?

A. Not with bodily oil, as the Kings and Priests, and Prophets were in the
old Law, but with the holy Ghost, the Spirit of God without measure being
poured on him, Acts 10. 38.

Q. Whereunto was Christ anointed with the holy Ghost.

A. To be the King, the Priest, and Prophet to his Church.

Q. Why is Christ said to be the King of the Church?

A. Because it is governed by the Law of Christ, and secondly, because it is
defended by his power against the rage of the devil, of sin, and of all the
enemies that oppose it, Luke 1. 32. 33.

Q. Why is Christ said to be the Priest of the Church?

A. First, because he has made an atonement for it, offering Heb. 24. 25.

Q. Why is Christ said to be the Prophet of the Church?

A. Because he has revealed the royal will of God unto his people, sometimes
by his own mouth, and sometime by the ministry of the Prophets and the
Apostles, fitted and enabled by his Spirit thereunto, Acts 3. 22.

Q. What is the meaning then of these words, I believe in Christ?

A. The meaning is, I believe that our Savior Christ is the true Messiah, the
Lords anointed, he that was ordained of God to be the King, Priest, and
Prophet of our Church, the King to rule it, the Priest to purge it, and the
Prophet to teach it.

Q. Why are we called Christians?

A. We are called Christians of Christ, because all true Christians are
members of Christ, and in some measure partakers of his annoynting, so that we
are Kings and Priests, and Prophets too, Acts 11. 26.

Q. How are all true Christians Kings?

A. They are Kings over their own hearts to command them of God, and over
their own corrupt affections to subdue them, and keep them under that they
reign not in them, Romans 1. 6. Secondly, because all the comforts of this life,
and the life to come belong unto them.

Qu. How are they Priests?

A. They are Priests to offer up their own bodies and souls by holy service
unto God. And secondly to entreat God for themselves and their brethren, 1.
Pet. 2. 5.

Q. How are they Prophets?

A. They are prophets both to stand out unto the death for the maintenance of
the truth, and also to teach that which they know to others that knew it not,
Acts 2. 17.

Qu. What think you of those who do not so?

A. Howsoever they carry the name of Christians, yet indeed they be none, but
mere hypocrites and dissemblers; whatsoever they pretend.

Q. What are we to believe concerning the Person of Christ?

A. We are to believe two things, 1. That he is very God. 2. That he is very
man.


Q. How does the Creed show him to be God?

A. First, because he is the Son of God. For as he that is the Son of
natural man, must needs be a man: So he that is the natural Son of God,
must needs be God. And therefore he is called the mighty God, Isay 9. 6. the
blessed God, Romans 9. 6. and the true God, 1. Ioh. 5. 20.

Q. Why was it needful that Christ should be God?

A. He that must redeem us, must bear the infinite wrath of God. But no
creature in Heaven or Earth, was able to bear the infinite wrath of God, and
to rise under it. And therefore none but God was able to redeem us, Job 9. 13.

Qu. What is the second Reason?

A. That the death of Christ might be of infinite value, and of infinite price
to redeem us. For it was more that God was scourged: that God was nailed to
the Cross: that God was killed for us, then if all the Angels and men in the
world had suffered, Act. 20. 28.

Qu. What gather we of this, that Christ is God?

A. That if Adam being but a man was able to condemn us; much more Christ
being God, is able to save us, Romans 5. 17.

Qu. How is Christ said to be the only Son of God, seeing all the faithful
are so also?

A. Christ is the only Son of God by Nature, and we are the sons of God
by Adoption and Grace: Christ is the Only Son.
Son of God; because he was borne of God: And we be the sons of God,
because it pleases God in favor to accept us for his sons, Psalm. 8 15.

Qu. What is the second Title, whereby it is showed that Christ is God?

A. In that he is called our Lord. For God is our only Lord, Deuteronomy. 8. 14. and
therefore seeing he must be acknowledged Our Lord.
to be our Lord: he must also be acknowledged to be our God, Ioh. 20. 28.

Q. Why is Christ called our Lord?

A. Because the godly ones are ruled by him, the wicked ever laboring to shake
off their yoke, Luke 19. 14.

Secondly, because he rules for our good, we having the whole fruit and
benefit of his government in the world, Deuteronomy. 33. 26.

Q. What is the meaning then of these words, I believe in Jesus Christ our Lord?

A. I believe that he was but a bare man: but the Son of God, that came to
redeem the world, even he that rules with all power, both in Heaven and in
Earth; and therefore is most mighty to save all those, who by true faith fly
unto him.

Qu. Why was it needful that Christ should be man?

A. Because he could not suffer in his divine Nature. First, and therefore
unless he had taken upon him the weak nature of man; he could not have
suffered for us, 1. Tim. 1. 17.

Secondly, because man had sinned; and therefore it was needful that man
should suffer for son, Heb. 2. 16.

Thirdly, that he might be the more pitiful and tender to us, having felt in
himself the many weaknesses and infirmities, that our nature is subject to,
Heb. 2. 17.

Q. How did Christ become man?

A. He was conceived by the Holy Ghost, borne of the Virgin Mary.

Q. How was he conceived by the Holy Ghost?

A. The holy Ghost sanctified the flesh of the Virgin, and therefore created
the Body of Christ without man's help, Luke 1. 35. Conceived by the Holy Ghost.


Qu, Why was he so conceived?

A. That he might be pure from original sin in his conception, Heb. 7. 26.

Q. Why was he borne of a Virgin?

A. That his strange birth might move men to look for Borne of the Virgin Mary.
some strange work at his hands, Isa. 7. 14.

Q. What Heretics are rebuked by this Article?

A. Simon Magus scholars, who denied that Christ was come in the flesh, and
therefore are called Antichrists, 1. John 4. 3.

Secondly, the Ualentinian heretics of old, and the Anabaptists of late, who
affirm, that Christ brought his body from heaven with him, and so passed
through the womb of the Virgin, as water through a Conduit Pipe, contrary to
the Scripture, Gal. 4. 4.

Q. What do the rest of the Articles concern?

A. The execution of Christ's office, whereof there are 2. parts, 1. His
Humiliation. 2. His Glorification.


Q. What is the first degree of his Humiliation?

A. He suffered under Pontius Pilate.

Q. Why is no mention made of his life, but of his sufferings?

A. Because his whole life was nothing but a suffering: his Passion began at
his birth, and from his cradle he was weeping He suffered
toward his cross.

Qu. Why is no mention made of his miracles?

A. Because we have more benefit by his suffering, than by all his miracles;
his miracles benefited only to those that lived in that present age with him:
but the virtue of his suffering reaches down to us, 1. Pet. 2. 24.

Q. Of whom did Christ suffer?

A. Of all sorts of men: he that came to save all, had all against him: the
Jews against him, and the Gentiles against him: the Priests against him, and
the People against him: the Soldiers against him, and the Thief against him,
yea and his own Disciple too.

Q. What did Christ suffer?

A. All the punishments that were due to our sins, Poverty, Hunger,
Contempt, Shame, Whipping, and buffetting, and the Wrath of God, which was
greater than them all.

Q. Why do the Martyrs suffer so cheerfully, and Christ so heavily?

A. The Martyrs though they felt pains in their bodies, yet they were
infinitely comforted in their souls: but Christ's inward sorrows were more
than his outward pains, Mat. 26. 38.

Qu. For what cause did Christ suffer?

A. He suffered for our sins; we are they that caused the death of the Son
of God; as we increased sin, so the torments were increased upon him. Isay
53. 5.

Qu. What was this Pontius Pilat?

A. He was the governor of Iewrie, Deputy to Tiberius Caesar Under Pontius
Pilate.
Emperor of Rome, Luke 3. 1.

Qu. Why is he here mentioned?

A. To show, That the Sceptar was now taken from Judah, and therefore this was
the time wherein Christ should come, Genesis 47. 10.

Q. Why was Christ condemned of Pilat?

A. That we might be acquitted at the judgment seat of God, Christ having
borne the whole penalty of our sin.

Q. What was the second degree of Christ's humiliation?

A. He was crucified. Was Crucified


Qu. What kind of death was that?

A. It was a most painful death, and a most infamous death.

Q. How was it infamous?

A. It was infamous two ways: first, By Gods Law, Gal. 3. 13. Secondly, By
Man's Law, because none but base and vile persons were adjudged to the Cross.

Q Why did Christ suffer such an infamous death?

A. That we might see what an hateful thing sin is in Gods sight; which
could no otherwise be expiated but by such a fearful and infamous death of
the Son of God. There is not the least sin that we commit, but it cost our
Savior Christ the dearest blood in his body.

Qu. What learn we by this?

A. To account no sin little, seeing the least we have cost our Savior Christ
not a little pain.

Qu. What other reason is there?

A. It meruailously commends our Saviors love, That Christ performed not some
slight matter for us, but underwent a most vile death, the death of the Cross
in our behalf, Phil. 2. 8.

Q. When was Christ crucified?

A. At noone day, that all men might see clearly life and salvation lifted up
upon the Cross, Ioh. 3. 14.

Q. Where was Christ crucified?

A. Without the City, to show that we must go out from this world, if we
will be partakers of the Cross of Christ, Heb. 13. 13.

Q. Who did crucify Christ?

A. The Jews, who longed for Christ's coming, yet killed him when they had
him, 1 Thessalonians. 2. 14.

Q. What miracles were done at it?

A. There was darkness from high noone till three of the clock. God put out
the candle of heaven, that man might leave work: When Man would not blush, the
Sun was ashamed and hid his face: When men's hearts would not quake, the earth
quaked for fear: and when men's hearts would not rent, the veil of the Temple
rent in twain, Mat. 27.

Q. What was the third degree of Christ's humiliation?

A. His death. Dead.


Q. Why did not Christ come down from the Cross, as the Jews would have had
him?

A. If Christ had come down from the Cross, the Jews

If Christ had come down, he had left the work of our redemption imperfect:
and therefore howsoever it might have

Christ showed then a greater miracle than that, if they would

Q. How did Christ die?

A. He died a voluntary death, and a holy death.

Q. How did Christ die a voluntary death?

A. He died not with extremity of pain, as others do, but he willingly
yielded up his life, when he could have lived longer if he would, Ioh. 10. 18.

Q. How did Christ die an holy death?

A. Though he had many sharp conflicts before his end, yet he made a sweet
close, in so much that the Centurion was more moved with his sweet death, than
with all the miracles which he had seen, Mark. 15. 39.

Q. Why did Christ die?

A. To free us from eternal death; for unless Christ had died on earth, we
had died everlastingly in Hell.

Q. Yea, but the Godly die daily.

A. But their death is not a punishment for sin, but a passage to Heaven and
Eternal life. And therefore it is one of the greatest blessings that God can
bestow upon a godly man, Phil. 1. 23.

Q. What Fruit have we by Christ's Death?

A. Remission for our sins; for Justice will not suffer that Psalm. 53. 5.

Mortification of sin; Christ's death obtaining not only Cor. 1. 30.

Q. What is the fourth degree of Christ's humiliation? And Buried.


A. He was buried:

Q. Why was Christ buried?

A. For two causes: First, the more to assure us of his death;

To confirm us the more, That Gods wrath is appeased thorough Jonas was cast
out of the Ship.

Q. What Fruit have we by Christ's burial.

A. By Christ's burial sin is buried in us, so that we have strong hope, that
it never shall arise, Romans 4. 6.

Q. What is the last degree of Christ's Humiliation?

A. He descended into hell?

Q. What is the first Degree of Christ's Exaltation?

A. The third day he arose again from the dead.

Q. What is the meaning hereof? Third day He rose again from the Dead.


A. That as a man that chops up a morsel that is too hot for his mouth, cannot
hold it, but is glad to give it up again: So death having swallowed up our
Savior Christ, and finding him too hot for him could not hold him, but was
glad to render him up again, Acts 2. 24.

Q. When did Christ rise?

A. The third day, not the first day, lest the Jews should think he had not
been dead indeed, but had been in a trance, Not the fourth day, lest his
Disciples should have despaired if Christ had been longer absent from them,
Luke 24. 21.

Q What difference is there between Christ's rising, and ours?

A. Christ rose by his own power, but we shall rise by the power of Christ,
as in a shipwreck, one swimmes to the bank, and a many hang at his heels, and
he draws them all out to the shore, 1. Cor. 15. 22. 23.

Q. What are the fruits of Christ's rising?

A. We are assured hereby, that Christ has discharged for all our sins: For
if Christ had not paid our whole debt, if but one sin had been left behind,
Christ could not have risen from death, the guiltiness of that one sin would
have kept him down. And therefore God in raising Christ, has declared
himself to be fully satisfied, and contented for all our sins, Romans 4. 25.

Secondly, by Christ's rising, we are raised up to newness of life. As it is a
shame for the Servants to lie in bed when the Master of the house is up: So
seeing Christ is risen, it shall be our shame, if we lie still sound a sleep
in sin, Romans 6. 4.

Thirdly, we are assured thereby, that our bodies shall rise again, being
parts and members of Christ, and living by the same Spirit, which raised Christ
out of the grave, 1 Thessalonians 4 4.

Q. What is the second degree of Christ's Exaltation?

A. He ascended into heaven.

Q. What is the meaning hereof?

A. That Christ left the Earth, and went up to Heaven, so He ascended into
Heaven.
that he is no longer in Earth, according to his bodily presence, either
visibly or inuisibly, Ioh. 16. 7.

Qu. What think you then of the Real Presence of Christ's body in the
Sacrament?

A. It is directly contrary to the Articles of our Faith, as Christ himself
shows, Ioh. 6. 62. For ask them of our faith, where Christ's body is; They
will answer it is ascended and gone into Heaven, ask the Adversaries, they
will say, it is still on Earth in this Sacrament on the Altar, etc. So that if
the Articles of our faith be true: their doctrine of the Real Presence cannot
be true, Math. 24. 23.

Q. How does Christ say then, he will be with us to the end of the world,
Math. 28. 20.

A. Christ will be with us always according to his Godhead, according to his
grace, according to the effectual working of his Spirit, as St. Mark expounds
it, Cap. 16. 20. but according to his bodily presence he is not always with
us, as himself says, Math. 26. 11.

Q. Whither did Christ ascend?

A. Into heaven, as all the Scriptures show, Mark 16. 19. Luke 24. 51. Act. 1.
11.

Q. What fruit have we by Christ's ascension?

A. First, Christ ascended into Heaven, has carried the hearts of the Godly
into Heaven with him: So that though they live here below; yet they have their
minds continually raised and lifted up to Christ that is above, Phil. 3. 20.

Secondly, we (by Christ's ascending into heaven) are already possessed of
Heaven: For as one friend takes possession in an others name, and it is as good
in Law, as if he had done it himself; So Christ in our name and in our right,
has entered into heaven, and made it as fine, as if we our selves were already
seized of it, Ephesians. 2. 6.

Thirdly, Christ ascended into Heaven, that he might appear in the sight of
God to make intercession for us. So that now we have a friend in the Court of
heaven, who keeps us in favor with God, and obtaines many blessings for us,
Hebr.

Q. What is the third Degree of Christ's Exaltion?

A. He sits at the right hand of God.

Q. What is meant by the right hand of God?

A. To speak properly, God has neither a right hand nor a left: For God is a
Spirit, and therefore has no bodily parts, as we have, but the right hand of
God, is the power of God, and the Majesty of God, as the Scriptures expound
it, Luke 22. 69. Heb. 1. 3.

Q. What is it then to sit at the right hand of God?

A. To be next to him in Majesty and in Power: for as Kings and great
personages, cause them to sit down on their And sits at the right hand of God
right hand, whom they will have honored, as second to them in the kingdom,
and next to themselves: So Christ is set down at the right hand of God. Because
God has lift him up even in his humane Nature far above men and Angels, and
made him in glory and honor next unto himself.

Q. Why is Christ said to sit?

A. First, to show that he is the Judge of the world, and all causes must be
brought before him.

Secondly, to show that he has finished the work of our Redemption, as a man
that sits down when his work is done, Heb. 10. 12. In the Sanctuary there was
no stool for the Priests to sit down, etc.

Q. Show yet more fully the meaning of the Creed in this sitting?

A. The sitting down of Christ, at the right hand of God, is the installing of
him in his Kingdom, and in his Throne, the advancing and lifting of him up to
be the head of the Church, and that person by whom God will rule all things
both in Heaven and in Earth, Phil. 2. 9.

Q. What learn we of this?

A. That Christ is now exalted in his kingdom, and in his Priesthood: So that
now he administreth both his kingly and his Priestly office, with greater might
and Majesty then ever he did before.

Q. What fruit have we by the lifting up of Christ in his Priesthood?

A. We know thereby that Christ's Intercession shall be more profitable for
us. For if Christ's prayer on Earth was always heard; we may well think that
being Sutour for us in so great Majesty and glory, he shall not be denied,
Romans 8. 34.

Q. What fruit have we by the lifting up of Christ in his kingdom?

A. Cor. 9 8.

Romans 26. 20.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they who doubt of Gods favor, or fear they shall not be able to live
this hard year; or think they shall never get Religion, or overcome the lets,
howsoever they say they believe: yet do not indeed believe that Christ sits at
the Right hand of God; that is, that he more mightily administreth his
Kingdom and Priesthood now, then ever he did before.

Q. What is the last degree of Christ's Exaltation?

A. From thence he shall come to judge quick and dead. The Judgment day.


Q. What is the meaning hereof?

A. That Christ in the end of the world, when the sins of men be ripe, shall
descend in a Cloud and sit down upon his throne, and all both great and small
shall stand before him, and the Books shall be opened, and they shall be
judged according to the things that they have done, be they good, or be they
evil.

Qu. What note we hence?

A. 1. That there shall be a Judgment. 2. The generality of the Judgment. 3.
The Person of the Judge. 4. The Time of it.


Qu. How know we that there shall be a Judgment?

A. First, by the Scriptures.

Secondly, by the light of Reason.

Q. What Scriptures prove it?

A. Jude 14. 15. 2. Cor. 5. 10. Act. 17. 31.

Q. What is the Reason?

A. We know that God is a just and righteous God, and therefore he cannot but
make the state of the godly better then the state of the wicked. But in this
world it is not so: For godly Lazarus lies pyning at the door, while the
wicked Glutton sits surfeiting at the Board. And therefore there must be a
Judgment, that the godly may be blessed, and the wicked punished.

Q. What fruit have we by this?

A. We know that Christ's coming, is for the further glorifying of his Church,
and the punishing of the enemies of it. And therefore, howsoever we are here
pressed and afflicted for a while, and crowned with contempt (as our Master was
with thorns) yet a day will come, when all our infirmities and miseries shall
have an end, and the faces of our enemies shall be filled with shame, 2 Thessalonians.
1. 6. 7. 8.

Q. What are we taught concerning the generality of the Judgment?

A. That all shall be judged, both quick and dead.

Q. Who are meant thereby?

A. By the quick are meant they, whom Christ shall find alive at his coming;
And by the dead, they are meant, that shall be dead before: So that all shall
be judged, Romans 14. 10.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That a day will come, when every one of us shall give an account to God for
his whole life, for every oath that he has sworn; for every lie that he has
told; for every penny that he has deceived; for every Sabbath that he has
profaned. And therefore, that we must be careful to fly these sins, and
the like, as we will answer to God for the contrary at the Judgment seat.

Q. Who shall be the Judge?

A. Christ in his humane Nature, John 5. 22. 27.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That Christ's coming shall be comfortable to the godly, and fearful to
the wicked; Comfortable to the godly, because he shall be their Judge, who is
their Savior, Luke 21. 28. Fearful to the wicked, because he shall be their
Judge, whose blood they have despised, whose Ministers they have disgraced,
whose name they have blasphemed, whose Sacraments they have contemned, whose
Sabboths they have profaned, Reu. 6. 15. 16.

Q. When shall the Judgment be?

A. In the end of the world: what year, or what day, or what hour knows no
man, no not the Angels but God alone, Math. 24. 36.

Q. Why would the Lord have it secret?

A. That men might be always upon their watch, and preparing for it: For the
count day will come suddenly, and therefore we must ever keep our reckonings
straight, lest it come like a thief in the night to steal away all our peace
and prosperity, and pleasures for ever, Mark. 30. 35.

Q. What is the third Person in whom we must believe?

A. The Person of the Holy Ghost. I believe inthe Holy Ghost.


Q. What are we to believe concerning the Holy Ghost?

A. Two things; First, that he is the effentiall Power of the Father, and of
the Son; the same God in nature, but distinct in Person: That he proceeds
from the Father, the Scripture is plain, John 15. 26. That he proceeds from
the Son, is as plain, Gal. 4. 6. That he is a distinct person from them both
is clear, John 14. 16.

Secondly, that he is the Sanctifier of Gods elect, and therefore he is called
the Holy Ghost, not only because he is holy in himself, but also because he
makes us holy, sanctifying both our bodies and our souls unto God.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That by nature we are more barren then the barrenest ground in the world;
having no spark of grace or goodness in us; And therefore, if there be any
love of virtue, any hatred of sin, we may well know it is not of our selves;
but the Spirit of God which wrought it in our hearts, Phil. 2. 13.

Qu. What does the Spirit of God work in us?

A. First, knowledge of the will of God: For whereas by nature a man has no
more true Religion, then a very beast: The Spirit of God opening and
enlightening the eyes of his mind, makes him able to conceive the secret
things of God, 1. Cor. 3. 14.

Q. What is the second thing?

A. Regeneration; For by nature a man is given to like best of the worst
things, and worst of the best things, and therefore the Spirit of God is feign
to cast him new, and to change every affection in him, John 3. 5,

Q. What is the thirdthing?

A. Communion with Christ: For by Faith the Spirit of God implanteth us into
Christ, as the Branches are knit into the stock; so that as the Branches live
and are nourished from the stock: So we partake of all the rich graces that
be in Christ, 1. Cor. 6. 11.

Q. What is the fourth thing?

A. Spiritual Government; For by nature we are so babish, that we know not
when to speak, nor when to hold our peace; how to pray, nor how to use our
Christian liberties, etc. And therefore the Spirit of God is given us as a
guide to direct us in every thing that we take in hand, Romans 8. 14.

Q. What is the fifth thing?

A. Comfort in Troubles; For the Spirit of God (assuring our hearts, that God
loves us in Christ) makes us to contemn the vanities of the world, and
(setting us in hope of the life to come) makes us set the less by the things
of this life, Ioh. 14. 16.

Q. What is the sixth thing?

A. Strengthening us. For whereas naturally we are quickly weary of good
things (the Spirit of God so upholding us in grace) that every day we feel
our selves brought into greater love and liking of the same, Ephesians. 3. 16.

Q. In whom does the Spirit of God work these things?

A. In none but the Elect. A Reprobate may have the Spirit of God, according to
some effects of it, as to make him see his sins, to be ashamed of them; and
to restrain him from the outward acts of them, to live ciuilly in the world:
But the Spirit of God inwardly killing sin, and sanctifying the Soul in all
his gracious effects, is never given but to Gods Elect, John 14. 17.

Q. May a man lose the Spirit of God?

A. The wicked (because they never had it soundly) may wholly lose it. The
godly cannot lose it wholly, but only according to some graces of it, and that
not finally but for a time: Because the Spirit like Sampsons hayne, will revive
again, John 7. 38.

Q. May we therefore live secure, because we cannot lose the Spirit?

A. Nay, but we must use the means which God has appointed for the
nourishing of the Spirit; as hearing of the Word, Prayer, Meditation, etc.
otherwise the best of us shall find the Graces of Gods Spirit, wonderful dead
and damped in us, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 18.

Q. How may a man know that he has the Spirit of God?

A. He may know that he has the Spirit of God by the working of the Spirit;
For, as a man knows there is life, in himself, as long as he breathes and
moves, and does the rest of the actions of a living man: So when a man lives
the life of the Spirit, and does the things which without Gods spirit he could
not do; he may well know that he has the Spirit in him.

Q. Do not many deceive themselves in this point?

A. Many do for want of judgment, for there is a certain working like the
Spirit, but it is not the Spirit. A certain boldness in the heart like Faith,
but it is not Faith: A certain kind affection like Love, but it is not love:
A certain hot humor like Zeal, but it is not Zeal; They be but vizards,
and counterfeits, which the devil makes to deceive poor people with, To make
them believe they have Faith and Love, and other virtues, when indeed they have
not; but certain empty shows and shadows of them.

Q. What is the first mark whereby a man may know that he has the Spirit of
God?

A. If a man feel himself better able to conceive the Mysteries of Faith, and
to take profit by the Ministry of the Word, either to the begetting or
strengthening of Faith in him: This is a sure token, that he has the Spirit,
Act. 16. 14.

Q. What is the second Mark;

A. If a man feel a sensible change in himself; so that he loves that good
which he thought he should never love, and hates that evil which he thought
he should never hate; and sets himself with diligence to the weakening and
killing, not of some few, but of all his sins: This is a true Testimony, that
he has Gods Spirit working in his heart, 1. Cor. 6. 11.

Q. What is the third Mark?

A. If a man feel himself checked inwardly for sin, so that he cannot tread
or look awry, but by and by he is closely touched and rebuked for it. This is
a sure token that he has the Spirit, Isay 30. 21.

Q. What is the fourth Mark?

A. If a man have an earnest desire to please God; to wish from his very heart,
that he could walk with greater care and obedience in all the ways of God.
This shall seal unto his soul, that he belongs to God, 1. John 2. 5.

Qu. What is the fifth Mark?

A. If a man feel himself much given to Prayer, not only in company, and at
ordinary times, but also privately by himself alone, with assured persuasion
that he shall fare the better for it: This is a certain sign of the Spirit
of God, Gal. 4. 6.

Q. What is the fifth Mark?

A. If a man dare trust the Lord with his whole state, and say unto God in
sincerity of heart. Lord, I desire not health nor peace nor plenty, but
according to thy will. I lay down my self, my life, and my comforts, and all
that I have at thy feet, dispose of me as best pleases thee; this is a seal,
that the Spirit of God works in his heart, 2. Sam. 15. 26.

Qu. What if a man feel not all these in himself?

A. Yet he is not to despair if there be any one of them truly in him. For as
there may be life in man, though he can neither see nor hear, nor speak nor
move: So though the Spirit work not so strongly in one, yet as long as he
desires to please God; so long as he is sorry for his sins; or at leastwise
sorry, that he cannot be sorry for them; he is not utter, ly to discomfort
himself in his estate, Romans 7. 22. 23.

Qu. What does the second part of the Creed entreat of?

A. Of two things, 1. The Church. 2. The Benefits bestowed upon it.


Q. Why is the Church mentioned immediately after the Doctrine of the Trinity?

A. Because, whatsoever the holy Trinity has wrought, The Church.
they have wrought it for the good of the Church. And therefore the benefit of
the Father in Creating: of the Son in Redeeming: of the holy Ghost in
Sanctifying wholly and entirely belongs to the Church: It is the Churches
dowry.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That if a man can approve himself to be a true member of the Church: Then
he may assure himself that he has his part in Christ: But if he be not a
true member of the Church; then neither God nor Christ, nor life, nor salvation
belongs unto him, Acts 2. 48.

Q. What is the Church?

A. The Church is the whole company of Gods Elect in all places and in all
Ages, knit by true Faith unto Jesus Christ their head, Ephesians. 1. 10.

Q. Are none but the Elect true members of the Church?

A. Hypocrites and wicked men may be in the Church, but they are not of the
Church; They may be in the outward society, and fellowship of the Church
mingled for a time, but they are not true members of it, because they are not
knit by true faith unto Christ their head, 1. John 2. 19.

Q. Why are the visible Assemblies called the Church?

A. Because in charity we are to think they belong to Gods Election, till by
Apostasy, or notorious evil life they give proof to the contrary.

Q. What are we to believe concerning the Church?

A. Two things. 1. That it is holy. 2. That it is Catholic.


Q. Why is the Church said to be Holy?

A. Because all the true members of the Church are washed from their sins by
the blood of Christ, and have holiness in some measure begun in them, Ephesians.
5. 28.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That they who are not holy, that is sanctified in some measure by the
Spirit of Christ, belong not indeed to the Body of the Church, and therefore
are quite cast on from all benefit by the death of Christ.

Q. Why is the Church called Catholic?

A. Catholic, is as much to say, as Uniuersall, or general. So that when we
say, We believe the Catholic Church. The meaning is, that we believe the
Church is not now tied to any one Country, as it was before Christ's coming,
to the Jews only, but in every Nation, whosoever fears God and works
righteousness, is accepted of him Ephesians 2. 14.

Q. Is not the Church of Rome the Catholic Church?

A. No: For the Catholic Church cannot fall away from the faith, Math. 16. 18.
But the Church of Rome, has no more privilege in this point, then any other
Church; for it both may and has departed from the faith, Romans 11. 22. And
therefore it is not the true Catholic Church.

Q. What be the marks of the true Church?

A. 1. Sincere preaching of the Word. 2. A right use of the Sacraments.


Q. Is not the Popes doctrine sound?

A. No; for whereas the Scriptures teach, that God alone is to be worshipped,
Math. 4. The Pope teaches that we may worship Saints, the Wood, the Crucifix
with the same divine worship that belongs to God. Where the Scriptures teach,
that there is one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Jesus Christ: The
Pope teaches, that every Saint and Angel may be a mediator for us.

Qu. Have they not a right use of the Sacraments?

A. No: For whereas Christ and his Apostles ministered in both kinds: they give
nothing but Bread unto the people: Where Christ and his Apostles celebrated it
in a known tongue; they mumble up all in a strange tongue, which the people
do not understand.

Q. What does the Pope make the chief marks of the Church?

A. First, Antiquity. Secondly, Universality. Thirdly, Succession of Bishops
and consent.

Q. Does not the Antiquity of the Church of Rome prove it to be the true
Church?

A. No, for as old as it is, it is not so old as the Devil. Again, there is
as great difference between old Rome and Rome now; as is between a chaste
Virgin and a common Harlot.

Qu. Does not Uniuersalitie prove it. For before Luthers time, all were of the
Romish faith?

A. That is not so; For before Luther, the Valdonses, and the Christian
Churches in Greece, in Armenia, in Syria, in Aethiopia, and other places, as
much abhorred fellowship with the Pope as we do. Secondly, is it had been
so, yet who knows not, that St. John has foretold; R^^. 13. 3. cap. 8, that
all the world should worship the Beast.

Q. Does not succession of Bishops from Peter prove it?

A. No: For Caiphas had succession from Aaron, and yet condemned Christ, and
their own stories tell, that there have been Monsters hather then Bishops
that have, sat at Rome, Tiberius, who subscribed to the Arian heresy,
Honorius, condemned by two General Councels, and John 2, 3. who held a
damnable heresy concerning the (...) of the Soul.

Q. Does not their unity and agreement prove it?

A. No: For howsoever they agree as Herod and Pilate did in condemning Christ:
yet they have infinite iarres and contentions among themselves, Pope against
Pope, and Cardinal against Cardinal, Doctor against Doctor, and that in
matters of faith, concerning the efficacy of the Sacraments, The Virgin Mary,
matter of Orders, Justification, etc. So that their unity is no other, then
such as is spoaken of, Acts 4. 27.

Q. What be the Benefits which God bestows upon his Church?

A. They are four in number, The two first concern this life. The two later
the life to come.


Q. What is the first of them that concern this life?

A. The Communion of Saints.

Q. What is meant thereby?

A. That all the holy people of God, have fellowship one with another, and with
Christ their Head, 1. Ioh. 1. 3. Communion of Saints.


Q. What is the fellowship which we have with Christ?

A. By faith we become one with Christ, of his flesh, and of his Bones, by
means whereof we have a community in all his Merits, and in all his riches:
So that his sufferings for sin stand us in as good stead, as if we our
selves had suffered for them: And his fulfilling of the Law benefires us as
much, as if we in our own person had fulfilled it. And his ascending into
heaven puts us in as good assurance, as if our selves already were ascended
thither, Ephesians. 2. 6.

Q. What is the fellowship which we have one with another?

A. It stands in four things. First, in joining together in the outward
worship of God, whereby we bring mutual comfort, and encouragement one to
another, Acts 2. 46.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That they who live idly at home on the Sabbath day, or content themselves
with some private duties of their own, and do not resort to the public
places, and public assemblies, which God has sanctified and ser apart for his
own worship, are found to despise the Communion of Saints.

Q. What is the second thing wherein our Christian fellowship consists?

A. In praying one for another, and that not slightly and coldly, but pressing
and importuning the Lord, as if our own state, and our own danger were in
hand.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That he that is a true member of the Church has all Gods people in all
places praying for him, yea many times, when he is not able to pray for
himself, a thousand hands are lifted up to Heaven in his behalf.

Qu. What is the third thing wherein this fellowship consists?

A. In communicating our gifts and Graces to the good and benefit one of
another. For as the eye sees not for the good of it self alone, but for the
comfort and benefit of the whole body: Even so we have our part and profit in
the gifts and graces bestowed upon others, 1. Cor. 12. 6. 7.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That as one candle lights another; So one man must bring on an other unto
God.

Qu. What is the last thing wherein the Communion of Saints consists?

A. It consists in the communicating of the good things of this life to the
mutual help and comfort one of another, accordingly as God has enabled us,
Acts 4. 32.

Qu. What gather we of this?

A. That they who are wholly taken up with the care of their own good, and do
not by love go out of themselves to the comfort of their brethren, whatsoever
they pretend, yet they belong not to the Communion of Saints indeed, 1. Cor.
12. 26.

Qu. What is the second Benefit?

A. Forgiveness of Sins.

Qu. What are we to believe concerning this?

A. Four things. The forgiveness of sins.
Even the godliest in this world: Not only they who walk with no care: But
even they who set a most narrow watch over their ways, and that not some
venial and petty sins, but even deadly wounds, whereof without the favor of
God, they might surely die.







Qu. How am I to apply this Article to my self?

A. By believing that I have many sins, and those so great, that without the
Lords mercy, I may be justly damned for them? Secondly, that all these sins
are forgiven in Christ, so that I shall never be challenged for any of them.
Thirdly, if God punish me at any time, it is not for my sins which be
pardoned; but either for my trial, or to keep down the corruptions of my
heart, that they break not out. Lastly, that howsoever I may fall of
infirmity, yet I shall be so-strengthened in grace, that I shall never
wilfully and purposely oppose my self against the Lord.

Q. What are the benefits which God will bestow upon his Church in the world
to come?

A. Two, The Resurrection of the Body. And Everlasting Life. The Resurrection
of the Body.



A. What are we to believe concerning the Resurrection?

A. Four things, 1. That the body shall rise again, 2. That the same body
shall rise again. 3. That it shall rise a glorious body. 4. That it is the
privilege of the godly only to rise so.


Q. How know we that the body shall rise?

A. By the Scripture, and by the power of God, Mar. 12. 23.

Qu. What Scriptures prove it?

A. Dan. 12. and Ioh. 5. 28. 29.

Q. How is it proved by the power of God?

A. Because it is as easy for God to raise man out of the dust, as it was at
first to make him of the dust: It is easier to raise man, then to make him. For
as when a house falls, the stones remain, and the timber remains, only it
wants the form and fashion of an house: So when a man dies, the soul
remains, and the body remains, at leastwise the bones, the spar and chief
rafters of the house, and therefore they may the more easily be knit together
and fashioned again.

Q. Why shall the same body rise?

A. Because it were injustice to punish that body for sin, that had never
committed sin, and to crown another body with Christ, and not the same that
had suffered for him.

Q. How shall it rise a glorious body?

A. First, it shall rise immortal; hunger and thirst and cold, and sickness,
and death shall no more prevail against it.

Secondly, it shall rise in perfect state; The Power of God supplying all those
members that now be wanting: he that lacked in eye, shall then receive an
eye; and he that lacked an arm, shall then have both arms restored.

Thirdly, it shall rise more beautiful then it was at first: For he that is
now crooked, he shall bestreightened; and he that is now weak shall be
strengthened; and he that is too big shall be lessened: And he that is
foul shall shine like the Sun in his strength.

Fourthly, it shall rise a spiritual body, ready and willing to do any duty
that the Spirit shall enjoin.

Q. Shall not the wicked rise too?

A. Yes they shall rise; but it were better for them if they might never rise:
if they might eye as a dog or a toade dies. They shall rise, but it is, that
their torments may be the greater, their bodies also then feeling as much, as
now their souls feel.

Q. What is the last benefit?

A. Everlasting life.

Qu. What are we to believe concerning it?

A. That the state of gods people shall be infinitely more Life Everlasting.
happy in Heaven, when God shall be all in all, reigning immediately in his
Saints?

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That we are set in a better state by Christ, then we lost by Adam: For by
Adam we lost but an earthly Paradise, but by Christ we have recovered an
heavenly for it.

Q. What else do we believe of this point?

A. That this happy estate of Gods People shall be for ever, the comfort of
it increasing, rather then abating any whit.

Q. Declare this.

A. In the delights of this world, the greatest joy is at first (as when a man
comes out of the cold to a good fire, after his joy abates by little and
little, until at length he be weary of it.) But when a man has been in
heaven a 1000. years, he shall find as much joy and contentment, as the
first hour that he came thither.

Q. Shall not the wicked rise to everlasting life?

A. No: For theirs is an everlasting death; they are ever dying, and yet can
never dye: ever consuming, and yet can never consume: ever burning, and yet can
never burn: like the Salamander that lives in the fire.

Q. How may a man attain to Eternal life?

A. Only by a lively faith in the Son of God: when a man stands persuaded in
his heart through the holy Ghost, that this is a chief part of Christ's
purchase, which without the high price of his blood we could never attain.

Q. What are the means to strengthen Faith?

A. Three, The Word. The Sacraments. And Prayer.


Q. What is Prayer?

A. Prayer is a pouring forth of the Soul before God in the feeling of our
wants, together with an earnest desire of remedy Prayer.
for the same.

Qu. How many things are required in Prayer?

A. Three things, 1. That a man know his wants. 2. That he earnestly desire
to have them supplied, 3. That for this end he put up his suit to God.


Q. Why did the Lord teach us a set form of prayer?

A. Because we are not able to look into the bottom of our own hearts, nor
to carry our selves in such a wise course, as becomes speakers to so great a
King: Therefore the Lord vouchsafed to direct us with his own mouth, that
keeping our selves to the rule that he has set us, we might be assured that
our prayers should be to his good liking and well accepted.

Q. How many parts be there of the Lords Prayer?

A. Three, 1. The Preface. 2. The Petitions, and 3. The Conclusion.


Q. Why does the Lord use a Preface to the Prayer?

A. To teach us that we may not pray without reverence, till we have in some
holy and heavenly sort fitted and prepared our selves for it. My heart is
fixed, etc. my heart is fixed, Psalm.

Qu. What learn we by this?

A. That their sin is great, who rush bluntly and boldly upon the Lord
without due consideration, and most holy regard of the excellent, and high
Majesty before whom they stand, Eccles. 10. 1.

Q. What other reason is there?

A. To teach us, that we may not pray without zeal till we have quickened
and wakened up our hearts to it.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That they sin in prayer, who let their prayere fall from them without
zeal, and without life: For why should God care for those prayers which we
ourselves care not for.

Q. How must we prepare our selves to Prayer?

A. By a serious meditation of the great mercy and power of God: his mercy will
teach us how willing and ready he is: his Power how able and mighty he is to
help us in our needs.

Q. How is the mercy of God set forth?

A. In tearming himself our Father. For in calling God Father we bring our
selves in mind, that we shall find him a Father, even fatherly affections in
him, ready to hear us and incline to our demands.

Q. What will this work in us?

A. An undoubted assurance that we shall be heard. For where shall a man
speed himself, if he speed not with his Father: And therefore seeing we come
to God in prayer, not as to a stranger that knows us not, not as to a stately
person that regards us not, but as to a most loving and tender Father; whose
ear hearkeneth, whose eye pittieth, whose hand is helpful to our needs, we
may assure our selves, that we shall not come empty handed, and with faces
cast down from his presence.

Q. How is God our Father?

A. By nature we are become the children of the Devil: Our Father.
But through Christ God has adopted us, and taken us for his own sons,
intending to bestow his crown and kingdom on us.

Q. Why does Christ direct this prayer to God alone?

A. To show that none but God is to be prayed unto, neither Saint nor Angel,
nor any other.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That the Papists in praying to Saints and Angels pray amiss, because their
prayers be contrary to the rule of prayer. Indeed they knock often and lay load
upon the door, but they knock at a wrong gate, and they mistake the door.
Two little rappes at Gods gate would do more good, then all their crying like
Baals Priests to them that hear them not, etc.

Q. Why are we taught to say our Father?

A. First, to teach us that we must pray for our brethren as well as for our
selves, and that their miseries must bring us many times upon our knees.

Secondly, to show that if we be true members in the body of Christ, we have
a part in every man's prayer; so that when we are heavy and troubled, and
cannot pray for our selves, we may then remember that a 1000. hands are lifted
to heaven, and a 1000. mouths are speaking to God in our behalf.

Q. How is the Power of God set forth?

A. In saying that he is heaven, for thereby we are brought Which art in
Heaven.
in mind of the heavenly Majesty and power that is in him, whereby he is
able to go through with his own work, and to accomplish whatsoever shall be
for our good, Deuteronomy. 33, 26.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That God is able to speed us, and we need go no further for any thing we
want.

Q. What else do these words teach us?

A. First, to lift up our hearts to Heaven when we pray.

Secondly, to think that God sits in the Watchtower of the world, and
therefore he sees us and marks how and in what sort, and how often we pray
unto him.

Q. How many Petitions are there?

A. 6. Whereof The three first concern the glory of God. The three other our
own good.


Q. What learn we by this?

A. That nothing must be more precious and dear unto us then the Name and
Glory of our God, and therefore that we must always begun our suite in the
earnest desire that the Lord may have a wonderful name among us, that we, may
set forth his glory whatsoever become of us.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That the prayers of such shall never be heard to any benefit or comfort of
themselves, who are wholly taken up with a care of their own good, and never
think what honor and glory may come unto the Lord thereby.

Q. What think you then of the Prayers of the Common sort?

A. That for the most part they please not God, for it is not the care of Gods
glory, but the only feeling of their own wants, that makes them pray: For if
it were not; more for their own good, and for their own comfort, then for any
care they have of Gods glory, they would never pray.

Q. What do we pray for in the first Petition?

A. We pray for the hallowing, or sanctifying of the Name Hallowed be thy Name.
of God.

Q. What is the Name of God?

A. It is the report of him, his remembrance and his memorial amongst men: so
that when we pray, (Hallowed be thy name) we pray that the Lord may have a
glorious and a great Name among us, that we may neither think nor speak of
him, but with high reverence and fear, with holy admiration of the excellent
and great things that be in Him.

Q. What are the special good things we pray for?

A. First, we pray that God would make his Mercy, Justice, Love, etc. so known
unto the world, that every one may be forced to admire it, and wonder at it:
That the Lord would show forth such evident, and clear tokens of the great
might and wisdom, and Justice, and power that be in him, that all men might
be convinced in their consciences, to confess that the whole Sovereignty of
glory and renown is due unto him.

Q. Declare this more fully?

A. We pray, that the Lord would stand up for his own glory: that the Lord
would get himself glory and praise by blessing and defending the godly, and by
punishing and afflicting the wicked.

Q. Do not many herein pray against themselves?

A. We all pray, that if we be any let or hinderance to Gods glory, so that
the Lord be the worse thought of for our sakes, that he will recover his glory
at our hands, ye though it be with the destruction of us.

Q. What is the second thing we pray for?

A. That we may acknowledge with inward feeling of our hearts the excellent,
and holy things that be in God, that we may do the Lord this honor to
think that he is most Mighty, and therefore will defend us when the whole
world is set against us: that he is most Wise, and therefore will do nothing
but it shall be for our good: That he is most pitiful, and therefore will
pity us, when no eye else will look upon us; that he is most lust, and
therefore will stand up in our just defense.

Q. What is the third thing we pray for?

A. That we so live, and so carry our selves in the whole course of our ways,
as God may have glory by us: That as a good servant does his Master credit, so
the Lord may hear well for our honest life.

Q. What is the fourth thing that we pray for?

A. That we may be so wholly possessed, and taken up with the care of the
Lords praise, that we may never speak or do any thing, but with this mind,
and to this intent to get some honor, and some glory to the Lord thereby.

Q. What are the evils that we pray against?

A. First, that we may not be so blind, but that we may see the great
glory of God, that shines in the world, his Providence, wise government, care
for his people, and the Judgments that he brings upon wicked men.

Secondly, that we may not doubt of any of the excellent things that be in
God; That he has not power enough to protect us; Mercy enough to forgive us,
Wisdom enough to direct us in the safest course.

Thirdly, that we may not dishonor the Lord by our ungodly and wicked life:
That we may not be a shame to the Gospel, men thinking the worse of it, for
the looseness of our lives that profess it.

Fourthly, that we may not seek our own praise more then the praise of the
Lord; and so greedily hunt after our own credit, that we care not in the
mean time, though the Lords honor lie in the dust.

Qu. What do we pray for in the second Petition.

A. For the means of Gods glory, that his kingdom may Thy kingdom come.
come among us.

Q. How does this Petition depend upon the former?

A. In the first Petition, we prayed, that we might glorify God: and now we
pray that God would rule in our hearts, that we may glorify him the better:
For unless God rule us by his Spirit, we are so set to pursue our own
praise, and peace and pleasure, that we shall never glorify him sincerely
while we live.

Qu. What is the meaning of this Petition?

A. Whereas the Devils kingdom is come already, and Sin holds up the
Scepter in a number of our hearts, we here pray as men weary of it, that Gods
kingdom may here come into our hearts, and the Devil and sin may no longer
rule among us.

Q. What is the kingdom of God?

A. Gods kingdom is twofold, The kingdom of Grace. The kingdom of Glory.


Q. What is the kingdom of Grace?

A. The kingdom of Grace is that whereby God governs the hearts of the
faithful in this world.

Q. How does God govern us in this world?

A. Two ways, Inwardly By his Spirit. Outwardly By his Word.


Q. How by his Spirit?

A. When by his Spirit and grace conveyed into our hearts, he not only shows
us the good way wherein we should walk, but also leads us in the way, and
gives us strength to continue in it, and checks our hearts when we go amiss.

Q. How by his Word?

A. As Princes rule their Subjects by those Laws and statutes which they make:
So God rules us by his Word, having there taught us what is right, and what is
wrong, or what is lawful and unlawful for us.

Q. What are the special good things that we pray for?

A. We pray, that God would give his gracious and good spirit into our hearts,
to the governing and guiding of us in our ways, that we may so live, as the
good Spirit of God would have us live, etc. and further increase this good
work when it is begun.

Q. Do all pray thus with desire to have it so?

A. No; many say, Thy kingdom come, that would not for any good, Gods kingdom
should come upon us: Many would be sorry in their hearts to do no more, then
God would have them do to part with so many sins, and leave so many vanities
as God would have them leave.

Qu. What is the second good thing that we pray for?

A. That God would rule us by his Word, that we may not be left to wander
after our own hearts, but that we may have the word of God to a continual
directing of us in an honest course.

Qu. What is the third thing?

A. We pray for all the good helps, and means, that may further Gods
kingdom, and namely for good Ministers, and good Magistrates.

Q. What do we pray for good Ministers?

A. That God would give good Ministers to all places, faithful and able men,
full of Spirit and power, who may build up the decaies and the ruins of the
Church, and seek up the lost souls of their brethren, and bring them home to
the Fold of Christ.

Secondly, We pray that God would bless and continue such as we have
already, that they may not be discouraged in their labors, nor hindered in the
Lords works, but may minister with great grace and cheerfulness amongst us.

Thirdly, we pray that God would make their Ministry effectual to us for our
good, that it may work upon our hearts to the killing of sin, and the
strengthening of Gods graces in us.

Q. What do we pray for Magistrates?

A. First, that God would raise up such, as may be Fathers of the Church: such
as may tender Religion, and wound with the sword of Justice, the head of all
ungodliness in the land.

Secondly, that God would bless and continue those that be such, especially
our gracious King, that his days may be as the days of Heaven, and his Throne
may be established in prosperity and peace, as long as the Sun and Moon
endure.

Q. What is the Kingdom of Glory?

A. It is that whereby God shall more fully reign in us in the world to come,
when all sin and wickedness shall be taken from us.

Q. What do we here pray for?

A. That God would make an end of this wicked world, and hasten to Judgment,
to the utter confounding of the wicked, and the more full and perfect Salvation
of those that belong unto him.

Qu. Why are we to pray for the day of Judgment?

A. Chiefly for this end, that the name of God may be no more dishonored in
the world, but the kingdom of sin and Satan may have an end.

Q. Do all wish for the day of Judgment?

A. No, many had rather it would never come. For O! if God should come to
Judgment, what should become of a number in the world? they should cry to the
hills cover us, and to the mountains fall upon us. And therefore, though they
say, Thy kingdom come, yet they would be glad in their hearts that Gods
kingdom might never come.

Q. What is the second thing we pray for?

A. Secondly, we pray for the day of our own death, for no other end, but
that we may make an end of sinning, and displeasing of God. For seeing how
prone we are to evil, and how the number of our sins increases every day
like old trees that gather moss; This must make us weary of the world, and so
to sigh and groan in our selves, desiring to be dissolved, and to be with
Christ.

Q. May a man then pray for his own death?

A. A man may not pray for it of impatience as a number do, who be running
out of the world, so soon as they feel the cross: But only in the desire to
be disburdened of the body of sin, and to serve God in the holy heavens, with
greater freedom and liberty of spirit then here they can do.

Q. What are the Evils that we pray against?

A. First, we pray, that whereas we have kept open house for sin and Satan
these many years, they may no longer overcome us, and prevail against us.

Secondly, we pray against all the letts and hindrances of Gods kingdom both
at home and abroad, as the Turks and the Pope.

Thirdly, we pray against the love of this world, that we may not dote upon
it, desiring to prolong our days in it, but that we may be always ready to
depart in peace, and to haste hence to our heavenly home.

Q. What do we pray for in the third Petition?

A. That we may do Gods will in Earth readily and willingly, Thy will be
done, etc.
as the Angels do in Heaven.

Q. How does this Petition depend upon the other?

A. Before we prayed that God would rule us, and now we pray that God would
give us sort and pliable hearts that we may yield our selves to be ruled by
him.

Q. What is the will of God?

A. The will of God is that which is revealed in his Word, and may be
considered in three things. First, it is Gods will we should leave our sins,
before they leave us. Secondly, it is Gods will we should lead a Christian and
a godly life, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 3. Thirdly, it is Gods will we should bear quietly
and contentedly whatsoever it shall please him in his wisdom to lay upon us.
So that we pray, that Gods will may be done.

A nobis, both of us, and De nobis and nostris, and of us and ours.
Qu. What are the good things we pray for?

A. We pray that we may leave our sins; that we may leave our swearing,
because it is Gods will we should not swear: our coveting, because it is Gods
will we should not covet.

Qu. What is the second thing?

A. We pray that we may live righteously, and holily in the world, that we
may love our brethren, because it is Gods will we should love them; that we
may make conscience of all our ways; because it is Gods will we should make
conscience of them.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That they which pray, that they may do Gods will, and yet have no care to
do it: They that pray against sin, and yet hug it, and keep it warm in
their bosoms, do but mock God in their prayers.

Q. What is the third thing we pray for?

A. That we may humble our selves with patience, and contentment to those
several troubles and trials which the Lord shall bring upon us.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That their sin is great, who pray every day that Gods will may be done on
them; And yet when it is done, fret and fume, and rage against it; and had
rather a great deal their own wills were done then the Lords.

Q. How must we do the will of God?

A. As the blessed Saints and Angels in Heaven do it, though not in the same
measure, yet in the same manner.

Q. How do the Angels do it?

A. First, they do it willingly and chearefully, and therefore they are
described to be winged, to show that they fly about it.

Secondly, they do it faithfully and not by halfes.

Thirdly, they do it constantly, as well at one time as at another.

Qu. What then do we pray for in this later part of the Petition?

A. First, we pray that we may cheerfully obey God like Christ, that said it
was meat and drink to him to do his Fathers will.

Secondly, We pray that we may not do Gods will by halfes, but faithfully
obey God in every duty required of us.

Thirdly, we pray that we may be constant in this course not to serve God by
moodes and fits, but at all times, and in all companies, as well in one state
as in another.

Q. We cannot possibly do the will of God so perfectly as the Angels do it.

A. Indeed we cannot, so long as we dwell in these weak houses of clay: Yet
we must still aspire to a better life, desiring in a greater measure to serve
God.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. A clear difference between the godly and the wicked; For the wicked ever
think they have religion and good lives enough, though they have never so
little. But the godly never satisfy themselves in it, but still desire to
walk more obediently, faithfully and uprightly with God.

Qu. What do we ask in the fourth Petition?

A. All things needful for this life.

Q Why do we pray for the things of this life first?

A. First, to the end, that being dispatched of our worldly Give us this day
our daily bread.
ears, and having things necessary aforehand, we might with more liberty
seek after those things which concern the soul.

Secondly, that finding the Lord easy to yield in these things of less good,
we might be the more imboldened to solicit him for the greater. For he
that will not trust the Lord for his meat and drink, will not trust him for
the saving of his soul: And he that thinks the Lord will stand with him for
a piece of bread, will easily think that God will stand with him for eternal
life.

Q What is meant by Bread in this place?

A. Not only bread. but whatsoever is as needful, and as comfortable as
bread, as health and strength to work in our Callings, houses to dwell in,
peace and friends, and good servants, etc.

Qu. Why does the Lord ^ame nothing but Bread?

A. To teach unto be content, if we have no more but bread, seeing we ask
no more: if God giuemore, we are to take it thankfully, and to use it well:
But if God shall cut short our fare, and bring it to bread only, yet we are
to rest with contentment in it, Phil. 4. 11. 12.

Qu. What gather we of this?

A. That they who pray for heaps of gold and silver, for stately and gay
houses, for sumptuous fare, for great livings, and the like, sin in praying
because not Christ, but Covetousness taught them to pray so.

Q. Why do we ask our Bread of God, seeing many of us have means ever to
get it?

A. Because all our pains is not able to procure us one morsel of bread,
without the Lords blessing be upon it, and therefore we pray God even to give
us that Bread that we labor for, knowing that without his blessing we may as
soon perish, when we have the greatest means to feed us, as when we have no
means at all, Psalm. 127. 1. 2.

Qu. What learn we by this?

A. That we must as hardly beg bread of God, that is, good succession in our
affairs, when we have the greatest means in the world, as when we have no
means at all, neither money nor friend, nor counsel to compass it.

Q. What need they ask bread, who have bread enough?

A. First, though we have bread: yet the bread that we have is none of ours:
For by sin we forfeit every day all we have into the hands of God, and we
dispossess our selves of all right, and title to it. And therefore unless the
Lord restore us and give it us again, we do but usurp upon any thing that
we have.

Secondly, though we have the substance of bread, yet we have not the staff
of bread, that is, the nourishing and feeding of it, but from God alone.
Unless God bless it, as good take a mouthfull of gravel, as a mouth-full of
meat, And therefore even then, when we have our Tables full of bread; yet we
had need pray still for our daily Bread, because our bread without his blessing
shall no more nourish us then a stone.

Q. Why do we say; give us our bread, and not give me my Bread?

A. To show that we must not regard our selves alone, but in a fellow feeling
pray for other men's wants as well as for our own.

Q. Whom does this condemn?

A. First, it condemns the covetous man who had rather say, Give me my
Bread, then give us our bread, wishing well indeed to no body but himself?

Secondly, it condemns those, who be spoylers of their brethren. For it is
as much as if he should say to God; Lord do thou give him bread, and I will
take it from him: Do thou make him rich, and I will make him poor: Do thou
make him merry, and I will make him sad.

Q. Why do we pray but for the Bread of one day?

A. Christ teaches us thereby to restrain and cut short our cares for the
time to come, and not to be tormented with the fear of any hard estate before
hand, but to resort to the Lord for the necessity of the day in the day
thereof, Math. 6. 34.

Qu. What encouragement have we to do so?

A. Gods care for the little Birds. For when they have dyned, they know not
where to suppe, and when they have supt, they know not where to dyne, and yet
God feeds them from day to day; how much more safely may we rest upon the
providence of our God, assuring our selves, that he that feeds us this day, will
feed us the next day, and the next, and so to our lives end.

Q. What other reason is there?

A. The Lord would bring us every day in prayer to him: For seeing we ask but
the bread of one day, when that day is past, our patent and our grace is out.
And therefore we must come to the Lord the next day to renew it again.

Q. What else do we learn by this?

A. We ask our bread every day of God, as being not able to live any one day
without him, and therefore it must be our chiefest care to stand fast by God,
to keep him our friend, whosoever be our foe, and that he may be pleased
whosoever is displeased with us.

Qu. Why do we say our Bread?

A. We are hereby taught to ask our own Bread, that which we have labored
for in some honest calling or other, for that only is ours, which is gotten by
lawful and by honest means: That which is unlawfully gotten is none of ours,
it is not our bread which we have of God, but the diuill and sin is the
purueyer and prouider of it.

Qu. What gather we of this?

A. First, that a man cannot eat his Bread with a good conscience, that has
not done something according to his ability, strength and place, to make
himself in some sort fit and worthy of it.

Secondly, that their sin is great, who desire other men's bread, and are not
contented with their own. And therefore break in upon their brethren, seeking
to defeat either their neighbors of their houses, or their servants of their
wages, or their laborers of their hyre, or the poor of their relief, which
in right and conscience is due unto them.

Q. What is meant by daily Bread?

A. That which is meet, and convenient for the day. The Nobleman has need of
more then the mean man: he that has a greater charge, has need of more,
then he that has a less charge; And therefore in asking our daily bread, we
ask so much as may be fit and convenient for our state, Prou. 30. 8. 9.

Q. And how much is convenient for us?

A. The Lord bids us not ask any set and certain stint, but to leave that to
him, and to his most wise disposition, who knows better, then we what will
serve our turns.

Q. What learn we hence?

A. That it can be no small comfort to us, that the Lord is most privy to our
estate, and knows what children, what servants, what charge we have, what
earnings, what commings in, and what goings out, and accordingly will fit us
with that, which he shall judge to be meetest for us, 1. Pet. 5. 7.

Qu. Do we ask these things absolutely of God?

A. No, we ask them no further then they may stand with Gods glory, and
therefore if they may be any means whereby we may glorify God the better,
we pray that we may have them: if they may not, we pray that both bread and
friends, and strength, and health, and all may be taken from us.

Q. What do we ask in the fifth Petition?

A. We pray for the forgiveness of the sins that be Forgive us our sins.
past.

Q. Why is this Petition knit to the former?

A. For two causes: First, because without the forgiveness of our sins, all
the bread in the world will not do us any good: For what shall it profit a
man to have a mountain of gold, and yet to carry a fire-marke in his soul,
the brand and mark of a condemned man, and to know that whenever he goes
hence, he goes damned to the devil, Math. ^6. 26.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That every Christian man and woman must make it their chiefest study, and
their chiefest care to find Mercy and favor with God in the forgiveness of
their sins, rather then to enjoy ten thousand worlds without it.

Q. What is the second reason?

A. Our sins are so many and so grievous against the Lord, that we are not
worthy of one morsel of meat to put into our mouths: yea, we deserve even
to be starued, and famished upon the face of the earth. And therefore, because
our sins are the bar and stop, that let and hinder Gods blessings from us;
therefore we pray God to forgive our sins, that the true hindrance of our
comforts being taken away, all his blessings in most rich and plentiful sort
may flow unto us, Ier. 5. 25.

Qu Why are our sins called debts?

A. Because, as a debt binds a man either to satisfy the party, or to go to
prison: So our sins bind us, either to satisfy Gods Justice, or to go to
hell.

Qu. What learn we from hence?

A. First, that we are all in the Lords debt, and it is not some dribling
sum that we owe him; but a thousand Talents at the least, more then we and
all the friends we have be able to discharge.

Secondly, that unless God be contented for them, we are sure to go to hell,
where we shall endure, not a months or a years imprisonment; But we shall
lie bound in the chains of horror and darkness, as long as there is a God in
heaven to revenge our sins, and the Devil in hell to torment us for them.

Thirdly, that there is no way to deal with God, but only by entreaty and by
request: We cannot choppe and change with him as the Pope thinks; Lord I have
so many sins, and here are so many good deeds for them: But we must beg
our pardon, and become humble sutours to the Throne of grace, that God for
Christ's sake would show Mercy upon us.

Fourthly, that we shall find the Lord ready for to yield unto our suit,
especially seeing the Lord Jesus, who sits at the right hand of God, is an
Intercessour for us?

Q. Must we pray thus every day?

A. As we pray every day for our daily Bread, so we must also pray daily for
the pardon of our sins: The pardon of our sins being as needful every day
as the bread that we live by.

Qu. What may this teach us?

A. That we sin every day, howsoever God shall bless us or punish us, or
teach or touch us with his Spirit, yet we know aforehand, that we shall sin
tomorrow, and the next day, and so every day to our dying day.

Secondly, that we sin often every day, and therefore we speak in the
plural number, Forgive us our sins: as having many sins to be forgiven;
And though we be able to discern but a few of our sins: yet our ignorance
is the greater, who sin many times, when we think we do not sin.

Thirdly, that as we sin daily, so it must be our care every day to make
even with the Lord, that we come not with after reckonings, with sins of 10.
20. or 30. years old not repented of, but that every day we reconcile our
selves to God, for the sins of that day, that whenever we shall die, we
may have but the sins of one day.

Q. What is meant by these words: For even we forgive them.

A. They contain, 1. A Comfort. 2. An Instruction.


Qu. What is the comfort?

A. That if we who are full of hatred and revenge can forgive our brethren:
much more will the Lord who is full of Mercy and compassion be ready to forgive
us. For we are not to think, that we can go beyond the Lord in any grace,
and therefore if we can love him that loves not us, and pass by many wrongs
we may well think, we shall find the Lord much more favorably inclyned to
us.

Q. Is our forgiveness a cause why God forgiues us?

A. No: For if we forgive our brethren some little fault, that is no reason
why God should forgive us our huge and mighty sins: But the Lord adds this
as a sure testimony of our souls, that if we who have but a drop of Mercy can
forgive our Brethren, much more will the Lord, who is even full of goodness
forgive us.

Q. What is the Instruction?

A. That we shall never find favor at Gods hands, till such time as our
brethren find love and mercy, and good dealing at our hands. For look what
we be to others when they offend us: the same we shall find God to us, when
we offend him.

Q. Whom does this Doctrine condemn?

A. First, it condemns those who will use extremity to their brethren, that
will not by any means bate of their right, but eagerly pursue every advantage
they can get against them.

Secondly, it condemns those that will say they forgive and forget, and yet
notwithstanding the memory of it is most quick in their hearts, and upon
every little occasion they break out again. Alas, do we look for such
forgiveness at Gods hands? how is it then that our Brethren can find no
better at our hands.

Thirdly, it condemns those that can be content to forgive some small
offenses of their brethren: but if it touch them somewhat near in their goods
or names, oh then the matter is heinous and so prejudicial, it touches us so
deeply, that it may not in any wise find favor at our hands? Why alas our
brethren cannot commit any so grievous offense against us, but we commit far
greater against the Lord, and therefore as we except against them: so we may
well look, the Lord will except against us.

Q. What do we pray for in the sixth Petition?

A. We pray for strength and grace against sin.

Q. Why are there two Petitions for the Soul, and but one for the Body?

A. The Lord would teach us thereby, that our care for heavenly And lead us not
into temptation.
things should be twice so much as our care for earthly; and therefore, where
we are once upon our knees for the blessings of the body, we should be twice
upon our knees for the blessings of our Souls.

Qu. How does this Petition depend upon the former?

A. In the former Petition we prayed for the pardon of our sins that be past,
and now we pray for grace and strength against those evils that be to come.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. First, that none are more subject to Tentations then the godly; For of all
men they are most laid unto, sin will be ever nibling, and the devil will
labor mightily to regaine his hold.

Secondly, that it is not enough to have our sins pardoned in Christ, unless
we have also grace to lead a better life, and to abstain from the same, or
like sins in time to come.

Qu. Do not the Papists say well? Let us not be led?

A. No, for they would seem to be wiser then Christ, and therefore they have
delayed his words, as being too harsh.

Q God tempts no man, ^ames 1. 13.

A. It is one thing to tempt a man to sin, another thing to lead a man to be
tempted of it. It was the devil that tempted Christ in the desert, but it was
the holy Ghost, that lead him forth as the Lords Champion into the field, Math.
4. 1.

Q. How may God work in tentation, and yet be free from sin?

A. First, by withdrawing his grace, and leaving us to our selves, as if a man
should send another his staff to go by, when his legs be lame, and
thereupon he begins to despise him and to set him light, the other takes away
his staff, and the lame man fall: So God having lent us his grace to walk by,
when we begin to think we stand not any way beholden to him for it, but that
we could shift as well without it, the Lord withdrawes his grace, and we
^unne into sin, and yet God is not the cause of our sin, but our own
weakness not able to bear up and to sustain it self.

Secondly, by offering occasion to try, whether he will sin or no: As a man
leaves a little loose money about the house to try whether his servants, or his
son will steal it: So God sends fear to tempt us to see if we will yield
to fear, Pride to tempt us, etc. if we do yield, it is our fault not Gods,
who did but vent us and set us a broach, and discover the bad liquor that was
in us.

Thirdly, by causing the motion, but not the evil of the motion, as when the
Sun shines upon a dead carcass there arises a stinking and a loathsome
smell, and yet the Sun is not the cause of it, but the corruption of the
carcass: So in every action God is the cause of the motion which is good: But
if we sin in moving, that comes of the Devil or of our selves.

Fourthly, by ordering the evil of the Action to some good end. As a Father
seeing his child to be busy about the fire, catches his finger and thrusts
it to a coal, to make him the more afraid of it after: So God sometimes lets
us taste of sin, that we may the more detest it, and hate it while we live.

Q. How many parts are there of this Petition?

A. Two: First, we pray that we may not be tempted to sin. And secondly,
though that we be tempted; yet that we may not be overcome of sin.

Q. Why do we pray that we may not be tempted to sin?

A. We know our own weakness to be so great and unable to resist
temptations, that we pray that we may not be tempted: So ready we are to
yield to sin, that we pray we may not be provoked to it. Often we sin,
and oftener we should sin, if we were oftener tempted to it; Many times we
are angry, and yet if we had ofter occasions, we would ofter be angry.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That their sin is great who fling themselves into tentation, that will
take up their dwellings in those Towns, and venture themselves into those
companies, where they know are many and strong entisements unto sin. What do
they else but offer the devil Blocks of advantage against themselves, and
hold him the stirrup, that his Tentations may the more easily mount upon them.

Qu. What are the Evils that we pray against?

A. They are of two sorts, 1. Sin without us, as the Devil and the world. 2.
Sin within us, as the corruptions and lusts of our own hearts.


Q. What do we pray for against the Devil?

A. That whereas the devil is wont to pull a vizard upon upon his face, and
to translate himself into an Angel of light, that we may have wisdom to
discrie him, and strength from heaven to stand against him.

Q. Does not every one hate the Devil?

A. Indeed many will say, fie upon the Devil, and say they detest him with all
their hearts; and yet in leading a profane and a wicked life, they bear him
about in their bodies with them.

Q. What do we pray for against the World?

A. First, that we may not be poisoned, and corrupted with the bad examples
that be abroad: That we may not catch the infection, but keep our selves
unspotted to the world.

Secondly, that neither our friends by flattery, nor our foes by fear, may
quench us in good things, and draw our hearts from God.

Thirdly, that our worldly cares may not ouergrow our godly cares, so that we
have more love to the frothy things of this life, then to those that concern
the life to come.

Q. What do we pray for against our own lusts?

A. That God will weaken the strength and power of sin in us every day, that
we may feel it either clean killed or so mightily weakened, that as a man
that has received his deaths wound; though he lives and breathes, yet
languisheth and faints, and droopeth every day more and more until he dye:
So sin may have less and less strength, till at length it have no strength
at all.

Q. Why do we ask all these things of God?

A. Because we are not able of ourselves to stand; the least enemy being
stronger then we, and therefore we pray to be girded with the strength of
God, that through his might we may do that which of our selves we should
never do.

Qu. What other thing do we pray for?

A. That if we fall into sin, that we may not lie in it, but that the Lord
will find us out in our falls, and seek up our lost souls, and bring us upon
the shoulders of his mercy to his fold again.

Q. Do the godly sin then as well as the wicked?

A. Yea, but the godly are ever desirous to be delivered from sin, and
therefore do both pray and watch against it, whereas the wicked hug it and
keep it warm in their bosoms, and are well content to continue in it, using
no means to get out of it.

Q. What means does God use in delivering us from sin?

A. The chiefest means, is the Ministry of the word, it being the hand of God,
whereby he pulls us out of sin, as a beast is lugg'd out of the mire: And
therefore we pray, that we may be obedient to it, and profit by it, that it
may make us wise unto Salvation, and mighty through God to withstand all
assaults that rise against us.

Q. What is the last part of the Prayer?

A. The Conclusion or shutting up of the Prayer.

Q. What is the use of the Conclusion?

A. It contains certain Reasons to strengthen our faith, For thine is the
kingdom, etc.
that we shall be heard. For this is a great cause why our prayers come so
coldly from us without heart or life, because we stand not strongly persuaded
in our hearts; that we shall fare the better for our prayers, and shall never
return empty handed from the Lord.

Q. What are the Reasons?

A. The first is taken from the kingdom or government of God q. d. Lord thou
art our king. And therefore as it is for the glory of a King, that his Subjects
be in good state, safe from their enemies, and abounding with all good things:
So thou Lord shall much commend thy self, and thy government to the world, if
thou prouidest well and sufficiently for us, who be the worshippers and
seruers of thee.

Q. Is this consideration so full of comfort?

A. It must needs yield all the children of God great comfort, that the
kingdom is come into their Fathers hand, and he has taken upon him the care
and the provision for them, who sits at the stern of the world, and does
whatsoever he will both in heaven and earth, Psalm. 97. 1.

Q. What is the second Reason?

A. The second is taken from the power of God q. d. Lord I have asked nothing,
but thou art able to give it: My wants be not so many, but thou art able to
supply them: My sins be not so great, but thou can for give them: My
enemies be not so strong, but thou can subdue them: I therefore cannot but
have great hope, seeing it is in thy power and hand to do me good.

Q. What is the third Reason?

A. The third is taken from the glory of God. Indeed if we pray not, then it
is our fault if we speed not well: But if we pray in Faith and reverence, and
make our requests known unto the Lord; then it shall be for the Lords honor
to be as good as his word, and he shall get himself great praise in the world
by hearing the poor and weak prayers that be made unto him.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That the Lord has joined his own glory with our good, and therefore will
hear us and bless us, if it be but to hold up his own estimation and honor
in the world, Ezekiel. 36. 22.

Q. What other sense do these words yield us (Thine is the Glory.)

A. Whatsoever gift or Grace thou shall bestow upon us, we will wholly employ
it to thy honor: we will rather seek thy glory, then our own praise, or
peace, or pleasure in the good use of it, Psalm. 81. 8.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That seeing we ask health, and peace and plenty to this end, that we may
glorify God the better, that when we have these things we be not found to
be far less careful of it, then before we had them, Deuteronomy. 32. 15.

Q. What else do you note in these Reasons?

A. That all the Reasons be from without us, and none from within us, there
being nothing in the best of us, in the merit and worthiness whereof, we may
think to be hear; whatsoever enclines the Lord to hear us, it is chieflly
and wholly in himself and not in us, Dan. 19. 18. 19.

Q. What is that other means of strengthening Faith?

A. The Sacraments?

Q. Whence have the Sacraments their name?

A. Of the Latin word Sacramentus, which signifies an Sacraments.
oath, whereby Soldiers were wont to bind themselves to be true to their
Captains: So in the Sacraments, we swear and bind our selves to be true
and faithful servants unto Jesus Christ.

Q. What is a Sacrament?

A. It is a visible sign of invisible Grace: So that in every Sacrament there
are two things. The visible sign that we may see: And the invisible Grace that
we cannot see. As in Baptism, there is a washing of the body, and there is
washing of the soul: The washing of the body with water, a man may see: But
the washing of the Soul with the Blood of Christ, he cannot see: So in the
Lords Supper, there is a feeding of the body, and there is a feeding of the
soul? The feeding of the body with Bread and Wine, he may see: But the soul
with the Body and the Blood of Christ, he cannot see, but by faith.

Q. What is the use of a Sacrament?

A. To confirm our faith by that which we see, in the truth of that which we
do not see. As in Baptism, the washing of the Body with water, assures our
hearts, that our souls are likewise washed with the blood of Christ. And the
receiving of Bread and Wine in the Supper is an evidence that the Body and
Blood of Christ is as truly received by faith, Romans 4. 8.

Q. What is the visible sign in a Sacrament?

A. It is the outward Element, together with those Ceremonies that are used
about it. As in Baptism, water, and the pouring on of water: In the Lords
Supper, Broad, and the breaking, and taking and eating of it.

Q. What is the Invisible Grace?

A. Christ (...) all his benefits as truly offered to ou^ hearts and souls is
the outward Elements are to the body, Galat. 3. ^7.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. Two things. First, that we receive no more in the Sacraments, then we do
in the bare preaching of the word. For the same Christ and the same Benefits
are tendered to our faith in both, only the signification is more lively in
the Sacraments, and the promises of Grace more particularly applied. John 1. 12.

Secondly, that the old Fathers received the same Grace by their Sacraments,
that we do by ours, for they received Christ.

Q. How many Sacraments are there?

A. Two, Baptism and The Lords Supper.


Q. What is the outward sign in Baptism?

A. Water, and the pouring on of Water. Baptism.


Q. What is the signification of it.

A. As the Water poured on the body washes away the filthiness of the flesh:
So the blood of Christ being poured upon the soul, washes away the
filthiness of sin.

Q. What sin have children of a day old?

A. They have Original sin, which is a secret naughtitinesse of nature,
whereby they are wholly given and inclined to that which is evil, Isay 48. 8.

Q. How is this taken away in Baptism?

A. In Baptism we receive the Spirit of Christ, and this Spirit works upon
our hearts renewing them, and enclining them to better things, and every day by
little and little prevailing and getting strength and ground of those
corruptions that are in us, Tit. 3. 5.

Q. May Children be saved that dye without Baptism?

A. Undoubtedly they may; For God has not tied his Grace to the Sacraments,
but that many times he works without them: And therefore it is not the want
of Baptism, but the contempt of Baptism, that brings danger, Act. 10. 44.
and 47.

Q. What proof is there of it?

A. Circumcision was as straightly required in the old Law, as Baptism is in
the New Testament, Genesis 17. ^4. But children that dyed without Circumcision
might be saved; As namely those that dyed before the 8. day, And therefore
Children may be saved without Baptism.

Q What other proof is there?

A. Children that are elected to Salvation, are holy before Baptism, 1 Cor. 7.
14. they are within the Covenant, Genesis 17. 7. the kingdom of heaven belongs
unto them, Mark. 10. 14. And therefore undoubtedly they may be saved.

Qu. How then does our Savior say, John 3. 5. Except a man be borne of Water
and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God?

A. We are to mark the person to whom he speaks it, to Nicodemus, who might
have been baptized if he would: So that our Saviors speech reaches no
further, but to those who may have Baptism and will not: For if none
absolutely might be saved without Baptism, how could the Thief be saved who
was converted upon the Cross, Luke 2. 3.

Q. Is it lawful for a private person to Baptize?

A. No: For this is to corrupt the holy Seals: For none may meddle in the holy
things, but they that are warranted thereunto by the Lord: But private persons
men or women, have no warrant from the Lord to Baptize, and therefore they may
not presume to intermeddle in it, Heb. 5. 4.

Q. What other Reason is there?

A. Baptism is a part of the public Ministry of the Church, Math. 28. 19. But
private persons, and chiefly women may not intermeddle in the Churches
Ministry. And therefore they may not take upon them to Baptize, 1. Tim, 2. 11.
12.

Q. Yea, but there is a case of necessity in it?

A. There is no necessity to break the Law of God, if we may have the
Sacraments according to the Lords institution, we are to accept them with
Thankfulness if we cannot, we must not think it lawful to come by them we
care not how.

Q. Zipporah in case of necessity did Circumcise her child.

A. The reason does not hold; For the Sacraments of the New Testament are tied
to the Ministry; And therefore none but the Ministers may intermeddle in them:
But the Sacraments of the Old Testament were not tied to the Priesthood (as
appears) for that Christ and his Apostles caused kill the Passover, who were
not of the Tribe of Leui, Luke 22. 19: Also in that Joshua did circumcise,
Josh. 5. 3.

Q. What is the other Sacrament?

A. The Sacrament of the Lords Supper.

Q. Why is the Lords Supper needful after we be Baptized?

A. Because by Baptism we do enter into the household of God, and by the
Lords Supper we are fed, and nourished in The Lords Supper.
the same: So that Baptism is the Seal of our entrance into Christ: and the
Lords Supper gives us our further growth and continuance in him, 1. Cor. 12. 13.

Q. How is this further declared?

A. By a similitude. For as a Master makes provision for his Family, that they
may be the more able to go through with their work: So the Lord has
appointed this Sacrament, for the strengthening of his people, that they may
be the better able to hold out in the holy labors and duties required at
their hands.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That they who come seldom to the Sacrament must needs be very faint, and
weak in the spirit; As a man feels his strength through long fasting to
abate, so that he is not able to walk with any cheerfulness and comfort in
his calling.

Q. What is the outward sign in the Lords Supper?

A. Bread and Wine, and the Sacramental Rites that be used about them.

Q. What does the Bread signify?

A. It signifies the Body of Christ.

Q. What resemblance is there between the Bread and Christ's Body?

A. First, as the body cannot live without bread no more can our souls live
without Christ. And therefore we must labor for Christ, as we do for bread,
John 6. 51.

Secondly, as bread strengthens the body, and makes it the more able and fit to
work: so that the eye sees the cleerer, the hand mooues the quicker, the foot
sets the faster for it: So Christ received by faith strengthens the Soul,
and makes it mighty through God, to perform the duties of obedience required
of it. Phil. 4. 13.

Q. What Bread did Christ use in the Sacrament?

A. Ordinary and common Bread, such as was usually at that time eaten with
their meats.

Qu. Why did Christ use common Bread?

A. First, left men (if the food had been finer) should have left the care of
feeding their souls, and fallen to filling their bellies.

Secondly, that as Naman learned, because the Waters of Jordan were not better
then the Waters of Damascus: Therefore, it was not the water of Jordan, but the
God of Israel, that cleansed his leprosy: So because this Bread is but
ordinant and common bread; we may therefore know, that it is not the bread,
but Christ signified by the bread, that sanctifies the receiver.

Q. Why did Christ take the Bread?

A. Christ by taking the Bread from the Table, showed that he would separate
it to another use: So that where before it served but to strengthen the body,
now it should serve to the strengthening of our Faith.

Q. How did Christ bless the Bread?

A. As the Lord blessed the Seventh day, by appointing that day to an holy use:
So Christ blessed the Bread by making (...) holy Sign, and a Sacrament of
himself.

Qu. What does the breaking of the Bread signify?

A. The breaking, and (...) of Christ's body upon the Cross. For as it is not
the whole loa^e, but the breed broken that feeds us: So it is not the life of
Christ, but the death of Christ; not Christ walking and working Miracles; but
Christ Crucified, (...) and torn with the Nails and Spear, that brings sound
peace and comfort to the heart.

Q. What are we bidden to take inn this Sacrament?

A. Two things, Bread to the feeding of our bodies, and Christ himself to the
feeding of our souls: For as the Bread is offered to our bodies: So Christ
himself is offered to our faith.

Qu. What learn we by this?

A. That he which comes to this Sacrament, must bring two hands with him: An
hand of the body to receive the Bread, and an hand of Faith to receive Christ,
John 1. 12.

Qu. Do not all receive Christ that come to the Sacraments?

A. No: For then every one should be the better for it, whereas now many
through their own default are not the better, but the worse after, God justly
revenging their irreuerence and contempt, 1. Cor. 11. 17.

Qu. Who be they that take no good by this Sacrament?

A. First, they that want Faith, which is declared by their evil life: For
they wanting the hand of Faith, must needs defeat themselves of the whole
fruit of the Sacrament which is received by Faith.

Secondly, such of the godly, as do not quicken and stir up their Faith, by
private prayer and meditation when they come to receive: For as a man that has
his arm benumbed, or asleep, is not able to reach out his hand to receive the
Bagg of gold that is offered him: So if our faith be dead and cold, and not
quickened up, we shall go from the Sacrament as empty as we came.

Q. How can we receive Christ's Body that is absent in heaven?

A. By Faith we may make it present, setting Christ (...) lively before the
inward eyes of our Souls, as if we saw him hanged, nailed, crowned, bleeding
upon the Cross, So Abraham by faith had as lively a sight of Christ, as if
with his bodily eyes, he had looked upon him, John 8. 56. So the Israelites
did eat and drink Christ in the Desert, 1. Cor. 10. 3. 4. and yet Christ was
not borne till 1500. years after.

Q. How are the godly said to eat Christ?

A. As a man is said to eat the meat that he lives by, which he does apply,
and appropriate to his body to the nourishing and feeding of the same; even so
when by special faith we do apply Christ unto our selves, and make him ours,
so that we live by Christ as a man lives by meat: then we are said to eat
Christ.

Qu. How is the Bread the body of Christ?

A. It is not verily and indeed his body: (For Christ's body is in Heaven only,
Act. 3. 21.) but it is his body Sacramentally, that is, a certain pledge and
token of his body. For as the Rock is called Christ, because it signifies
Christ, 1. Cor. 10. 4. So here the bread is called Christ's Body, because it
signifies his body.

Q. Do we then receive nothing but a Sign of his Body?

A. Yes, we receive the very body of Christ by Faith: for the bread which we
receive with our mouths, is a true token that Christ's body is received by
faith: For as a man that takes a key in sign of possession takes not the bare
sign, but the very possession together with the sign: So they that worthily
Communicate, receive not a bare sign of the Body, but the very body it self
spiritually and by faith.

Q. What difference is there then between the Papist opinion and ours?

A. They think that they eat Christ corporally, and carnally with their
teeth, and therefore they cage him up in the consecrated Host, and hold that a
cat or a mouse may devour him. But we (knowing that Christ is now food for the
belly, but food for the soul) affirm that Christ is not (...) ca^al^^ with
the teeth, but spiritually by faith, John 6. 63. 1. Cor. 10.

Q. Why does Christ add, My body which is given for you?

A. To show that it is not Christ's body glorious in Heaven (...) down in great
Majesty upon the Throne of God, but it is his wounded body, his bleeding body,
his dead body, that our faith must feed upon: So that here we are led back to
the cross of Christ, that we may lay to our mouths, and ever suck life and
Salvation out of his bleeding sides.

Q. How may we feed upon the dead body of Christ?

A. By faith we must set our selves upon Mount Caluery, and there behold our
Lord upon the Cross with his shoulders trickling, with his head spinning, with
his hands streaming, with his sides gushing, all his body running down with
blood, and then say, Behold, this is the Body that is given for me: These
sides were whipped, that mine might be spared: These hands were nailed that
mine might be freed: These cheeks were buffeted, that mine might be kissed:
This head was crowned with Thorns, that mine might be crowned with glory:
These torments Christ suffered on Earth, that I might not suffer greater things
in Hell, Zach. 12. 10.

Q. What is the second Reason?

A. To show that we were the Authors, and causes of the death of Christ. It
was our sin that brought all these punishments and these pains upon him: As
an unthrift that comes behind hand, and his surety is made to pay for all: So
all our sins were charged upon Christ's head, and he was feign to suffer
whatsoever we should have suffered for them, Psalm 53. 5.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That if we detest Judas, that betrayed Christ, and Pilate that condemned
him, and the Jews that killed him; Much more should we hate our sins, that
were the chief causes of his death.

Q. To what end must we celebrate the Lords Supper?

A. To stir up our faith to a more lively consideration of the death of
Christ.

Q. Is there any that forget the Death of Christ?

A. Too many forget it, or very coldly consider it. First, they that will do
nothing for their brethren, little considering how much Christ has done for
them. Secondly, they that live in sin, little consider, what Christ suffered
for it. Thirdly, they that will bear no disgrace for Christ, little remember
how he was disgraced for them. Lastly, they that will sell themselves for a
^^rifle to the Devil, little consider how dearly they were bought.

Q. Why are there two signs in the Lords Supper, and but one in Baptism?

A. Christ is set forth in Baptism, as washing the soul from sin: And
therefore, because water of it self is enough to wash the body, therefore
there needed nothing else to signify the washing of the soul. But in the
Sacrament of the Supper, Christ is proposed, as a nourishment feeding us and
upholding us in the life of Grace: And therefore, because bread is not
sufficient to sustain the bodily life without wine, nor wine without bread.
Therefore two Signs were appointed, to show that we have our whole
nourishment by Christ.

Qu. What resemblance is there between the Wine and Christ's blood?

A. As Wine makes glad the heart of men, and a man having tasted of it,
forgets the trouble and the miferie that lies upon him: So the blood of
Christ (which speaks better things then the blood of Abel, even peace and
salvation to those that killed him) brings unspeakable joy and comfort to the
heart, Ephesians. 2. 13.

Secondly, as wine breeds good blood, and good spirits in a man, and a man
having tasted of it, the very color and the strength of it will appear in his
face; yea, it will make his very breath smell the sweeter for it: So the blood
of Christ breeds good thoughts, and good desires, and good affections in the
heart, and a man having tasted of it by faith, all his actions and all his
thoughts will be full of the good taste, and good relish of the same.

Q. When did Christ ordain this Sacrament?

A. After Supper, that is, after the eating of the Paschall lamb. When they
had now sufficiently filled themselves with meat, and so needed not any
further nourishment for this life; to show that it is not the bodily life, but
the spiritual, that he seeks to feed, and to nourish in them, Luke 22. 20.

Q. What learn we by this?

A. That men must come to the Lords Table not to fill their bellies, but to
seed their souls, to have their faith strengthened, their zeal kindled, their
love increased, all their graces to be quickened in them.

Qu. What else may be observed in the time?

A. That the Disciples having supped before, had so moderately used the matter,
that they were fit to receive the Sacrament afterward, which may teach us to
use such sobriety and moderation in our meats, that we be not thereby made
any way unfit for holy duties.

Q. Whom does this meet withal?

A. It meets with those, who stuff themselves with meat, especially upon the
Sabbath day; That thereby they become utterly unfit for any holy Duty, being
readier to sleep then to hear, and to seek ease for the body, then any
comfort for the soul.

Qu. Is the Cup indifferently to be administered unto all?

A. If the Bread must be administered unto all, much more the Cup, Christ's
commandment being more express for the Cup, Math. 26. 17.

Qu. Why did Christ make such express mention of the Cup?

A. Christ being a Prophet foresaw in his Spirit, that the Pope would deny the
people the Cup, but not the Bread, and therefore he has given a more
express charge for the Cup, to break the neck of this heresy before it
rose.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That the Papists bearing hatred to the truth, through the just judgment of
God upon them, are commonly cast upon these errors, which may most easily and
most plainly, be convinced by the Scriptures.

Qu. How is W^e the Blood of Christ?

A. It is not properly indeed his blood. (For Christ's blood was not then in the
Cup, but in the ^nes and arteries of his Body, else how could the soldiers
have shed it the next day,) but it is called his blood, because it is a sign
and a figure of his blood.

Q. How is this proved?

A. First, the drinking of blood was condemned by the Law as an horrible thing,
Leu. 7. 27. (...) Christ never brake the Law, Math. 5. 17. And therefore ^ee
drank not his own blood, nor commanded others to drink it carnally.

Secondly, Christ expounds himself, For le^t some should mistake his meaning,
he shows in the very next verse, that it was not Blood, but very Wine, that
he drunk, Math. 26. ^9.

Q. Why is Christ's Blood called the Blood of the new Testament?

A. Because the new Testament was ratified and confirmed by it, Heb. 9. 16.

Q. What is a Testament?

A. It is that which we commonly call a dead man's Will, whereby he gives away
his goods, and disposes of his lands and livings that belong unto him. Such a
will Christ made at his death, that he gave away all he had. The Soldiers had
his Garments, the grave had his Body, heaven had his Soul: But his
righteousness, his holiness, his merits, his kingdom and glory he bestowed
upon his people.

Q. How many Wills did the Lord make?

A. The Lord made two Wills or Testaments, An Old Will, And a New Will,
Gal. 4. 24.

Q. What was the tenor of the Old Will or Testament?

A. Therein the Lord bequeathed life and Salvation to those only that fulfill
the Law, Romans 10. 5.

Q. What is the tenor of the New Testament?

A. Therein the Lord bequeathes heaven, and the happiness thereof to those
that believe in Christ, Romans 10. 9.

Q. Why did the Lord make this later Testament?

A. Because we were all cut off of all by the former, for that gave us
nothing, but upon condition that we should fulfill the Law, and therefore
seeing we could not perform the condition, we could not recover one penny by
the Will. Therefore the Lord to relieve us made a new will, and a^^exed (...)
easier condition: That all should be saved who believe in Christ, Heb. 8, 6. 7.

Q. What gather we of this?

A. That the Papists folly is exceeding great, who make our state far worse
by the second Testament then it war by the first. For by the first Testament
Merits only were required to Salvation: But by the later (as they say) both
our whole task of works is required, and besides that, Faith in the
Mediator; So that our condition is now harder then in the Old Testament, God
requiring then but works only; but now as they say, both faith and works, as
needful to Salvation.

Q. Why does Christ say his Blood is shed for many?

A. To show that all have not benefit by the blood of Christ. For though
Christ's blood be a fountain to wash away uncleanness: Yet we see a number
had rather run further into the mire, then come to the lauour of Christ's
blood to wash away any one corruption that is in them.

Q. Why did Christ shed his Blood?

A. To purchase pardon, and forgiveness for our sins, Christ suffering that
in his body and soul, which we should have suffered for our sins.

Q. Have we no other benefit by the Blood of Christ?

A. Yes: Through the blood of Christ, we be not only discharged of the
sins that be past, but we have strength and power against those Tentations
and evil motions that be to come, Heb. 9. 14.

Qu. How have we this?

A. Even as a Corrasiue, being applied unto the diseased part, eats out the
corrupt flesh, and draws out the poison and the venom that is in it: even so
the blood of Christ being applied by faith eats out the dead affections, and
suckes out the Cankered corruptions that are in it.

Q. Why then does Christ mention no benefit but Remission of sins?

A. Because this is the chiefest. For every day we deserve to be cast into
Hell; and we give the Lord just cause to strip us, and to take away all his
blessings from us: And therefore if Christ's blood did not obtain pardon for
our sins, we might not look to live one day in any tolerable estate.

Q. May all come to receive the Sacrament?

A. No, none but they, who upon due trial find themselves meet and fit to
receive it, 1. Cor. 11. 28.

Q How must a man make trial of his fitness?

A. First, whether he be Gods servant or no. For God has furnished his Table
for none, but for his own people, and therefore unless a man can approve
himself to be one of Gods Family, and of Gods household, he may not press,
and presume to come unto it, 1. Cor. 10. 21.

Qu Wherefore may not others come?

A. If a man had provided a good meal for his servants that have done his
work, and a sort of R^ans, and roysters, that have done nothing for him,
should come in and eat it up, would not he frown and take on, when he
should spy them at his Board: So God having provided this Sacrament for his
Servants, will not take it well, if heespie any other there, that have not
served him, Math. 22. 12.

Qu. How shall a man know, whether he be Gods servant or not?

A. By considering whose business it is that he has labored in, whether it
be Gods work, or the devils work which he has done. Love, and Patience, and
Temperance and holiness be Gods works: But malice and envy, and slandring,
and lying, and swearing be the devils works: So that a man may soon see
what Master he has served, Romans 6. 16.

Q. What is the second Point of a man's trial?

A. If he be Gods servant, he must then see with what faithfulness he has
walked in his service, how he has carried himself toward God, the Master of
the house, whether he has loved him, feared him, served him, obeyed him,
been thankful for his mereies; humbled by his Judgments, and how he has
carried himself toward his fellow Servants in the house, whether he has
sought their comfort, strengthened them in good things, tendered their credit,
etc. 3. How he has lived toward himself in the moderate use of his
Christian liberties, in eating, drinking, sleeping, sowing, etc. Psalm. 119. 59.

Q. What is the third Point of a man's trial?

A. When a man sees how loosely, and how unfaithfully he has done his work;
how ill he has performed his task. Then he must consider, whether he be
truly sorry for it, whether he be even ashamed of his negligence, and of his
sloach, that he has lived no better toward God, toward man, toward
himself; and whether he have no remorse nor feeling of it, Exodus 12. 8.

Q. What is the fourth Point?

A. Then he must consider, whether he do not desire to rise out of his
estate, and whether he be careful to use the means in reconciling himself
to his brethren; in seeking to be at one with God, and so minding to come to
the Sacrament and for no other end, but to renew the Covenant between God, and
his soul, and to draw strength from Christ, to live better after then before,
Ier. 50. 5.

Q. What is the fifth Point.

A. Lastly, whether if God shall set him upon clear board again, he have a
full purpose to watch better over his ways, never to live as he has lived,
to avoid the occasions of sin, and to take more pains for the nourishing,
and increasing of good things in his heart.

Qu. What is the use of this?

A. That a man finding these things in some measure in himself, may be bold to
come with comfort: But they that have no care to get them, may well look for a
cold welcome of the Lord.

Q. How are we to behave our selves in the receiving of the Sacrament?

A. First, we are to come with great reverence, as into Gods presence; with
great care, that we do not provoke the Lord by any light, or wanton, or
unseemly behavior of ours, that the Lord spy no contempt, no looseness, no
profaneness in us, Leuit. 10. 3.

Q. How is this declared?

A. If a man were to go but into the presence of a Prince, how careful would
he be, neither to do nor to speak any thing that might offend: How much
more when we come into the presence of Almighty God, must we take great heed,
that we do not the least things that may be displeasing in his fight.

Q. What is the second Point?

A. Secondly, we must apply our selves to the Action that we have in hand,
bethinking our selves what we came for: namely, to have our sins weakened,
our faith strengthened, our zeal kindled, our care quickened, our Graces
nourished, and answerably thereunto laboring and indeauouring, the supplying
of our wants, to draw life and strength from the dead body of our Savior
Christ, that as the woman was healed by touching him, Mark. 5. 29. and straight
way the course of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she
was healed of her plague: So we touching Christ by Faith, may have the course
of sin stopped, and the fountain of uncleanness dried in us all.

Q. What is the third Point?

A. Thirdly, we must look that our hearts consent with our mouths in the
prayers of the Church: That we lie not to God, and say we bewail our sins,
when indeed we be never a whit sorry for them: That we repent us of our
faults, when intruth we have not so much as a purpose to amend: We lift up
our hearts to God, when many times we do not so much as think of God. For
what an heavy thing is it to sin there, where we come to crave pardon of our
sins, Isay 65. 3.

Q. What is the fourth Point?

A. Fourthly, we are to mark what is done in the holy ministration, not to
sit in a brown study, as a number do, but to fire our eyes upon the
Sacramental signs, and when we see the Bread broken and pulled in pieces;
Then to think, even so was the Body of our Lord, rent and torn upon the
Cross for our sins. When we see the Wine poured out; Then to think, even
so was the Blood of Christ poured out of his Body, that I might have health
and comfort by it: And therefore when I reach out my hand to receive the bread:
Then I must look that my heart be ready to receive Christ who is offered to my
Faith.

Q. What is the fifth Point?

A. Fifthly, the Lord having sealed the Covenant on his part; we are likewise
to Covenant on our parts, that seeing it has pleased God to forgive the sins
that be past, and to bring us into favor again; That therefore by his
Blessing, we will never live as we have lived; we will never spend our time
as we have spent it; we will never love sin as we have loved it: But the
rest of the days, that we have to live, shall be wholly dedicated and vowed
unto the Lord.

Q. What is the last Point?

A. Lastly, when our selves have received, then we are to look how others
receive; that seeing we be all servants of one Lord, all feed at one Table,
all nourished with one meat: That therefore, there may be more mercy, more
kindness, more Christian love among us: And it may be our shame; that we
cannot live peaceably together on Earth; who hope one day to live joyfully
together in heaven, 1. Cor. 10. 17.

Q. What are we to do after we have received?

A. We are to give the Lord great thanks for the death of his Son, for
giving us our part in him, and for the holy use of the Sacraments, wherein
Christ is so freely set forth, that we may after a sort taste him with our
tongues, feel him with our singers, smell him with our noses, behold him with
our eyes, and even feel him sensibly bestowed upon us, Psalm. 116. 12. 13.

Q. What is the second thing?

A. Secondly, we must have great care to live better after, then before: That
we fall not back to our old sins, and suffer our woonted malice, and sloth
and vanity to creep upon us: and this not for a day or two, but all the days
of our lives, even as long as it shall please God to continue us here below,
John 5. 14.

Qu. Whom does this Doctrine meet withal?

Answ. First, it meets with those, who as soon as they have received, run
immediately to profaneness; spending the best part of the day in gadding, and
swilling, that it may justly be feared, that the Devil makes a better market
that day, then he does many days beside.

Secondly, it meets with a number, that will Saint it, and live very devoutly
that day: But the very next day or few days after, they return to their old
bent, and run themselves, as deep in the mire as they were before.

Qu. What is the third thing?

Answ. We must bring our selves often into mind of the Covenants and vows
which we have made to God, thinking with our selves that such and such a day,
we were before the Lord, and there we swear in his hearing, and in the
hearing of his People, that we would never live as we have lived: We would
lie no more, curse no more, bear no more malice: And therefore, what a
Judgment shall we pull upon our heads, if we shall not be careful in some
good measure to perform it.

Qu. What is the fourth thing?

Answ. Fourthly, we are to mark how the Sacrament works upon us: Whether we
find our selves the better for it; the stronger to resist sin: the
cheerefuller in Gods service, the tenderer to our Brethren: And if it do not
work; What is the reason of it? Whether want of preparation, or want of
reverence, or want of care afterward; that the next time we come, we may
come to better fruit.

Q. What is the last thing?

Answ. We must not be long away, but so soon as we feel any deadness, or
coldness, or weakness to grow upon us: we are to make recourse hither again
for the recovering of our strength: For as a man in a long journey had need of
many Baits: So the Christian that has a long Journey to go from Earth to
Heaven, from man to God, from Mortality to Immortality, had need to come often
to the Lords Table to be refreshed.

Quest. What is the reason then that some come so seldom?

Answer. Many of the Passengers do not feel their need: no, though they be
ready to drop down into every ditch: But such as feel the want, they are
careful to use the Lords help against it.

ON THE LORDS PRAYER. Being the Sum and Marrow of diverse Sermons, written and

AN EXPOSITION ON THE LORDS PRAYER.
MATTHEW. 6. 9. After this manner therefore pray ye. Our Father which art in
heaven, Hallowed be thy Name.

Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.

And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the
Kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever, Amen.


Having already spoken of the first part of Christian profession: the second
follows, and that is Prayer, wherein we can have no better guide to direct
us, then the Lord himself, nor sweeter words then those so effectual of our
Savior Christ.

There are then two things commended unto us in the words of our Savior Christ.

1 A Duty, which is, that we must pray.

2 A direction in this Duty, how, and in what manner we must pray; both which,
are employed in these first words of Christ. After this manner pray ye.

1 Concerning the Duty, two things are required, 1 What it is to pray? 2 Why we
must pray?


For the first; Prayer is a lifting up of the heart unto 1 Prayer, what it is?
God, whereby we desire things needful of him, as the welspring and fountain
of all goodness. Whence it appears, that there are three things remarkable
in Prayer.

Prayer is an action or motion of the heart: It is not a moving of the mouth,
or an action of the lips only; but properly, an action or moving of the
heart; as 1 Samuel 1. 13. Anna prayed in her heart, but her mouth 1 Samuel 1. 13.
spoke not. So Psalm. 20. 4. the Prophet prays; And grant Psalm. 20. 4.
thee according to thy heart, etc. So Ephesians. 5. 19. the Apostles Ephesians. 5. 19.
words are, Speaking to your selves in Psalms and Hymns, and spiritual songs,
singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord. So that Prayer must needs
have the working of the heart, for if it come not from thence, if that be not
moved to pray, it is but lip-labor, and an idle sound; It is no prayer,
because in prayer, there must be a moving of the heart. The Lord by the
Prophet, complains of this neglect. And they have not cried unto Hos. 7. 14.
me with their hearts, when they howled upon their beds, etc. and 1 Kings 8.
39. Solomon prays to God, 1 Kings 8. 39.
that when any man prays, the Lord would give unto him, as he knows his
heart. For the Lord only knows the hearts of the children of men. By which
it is evident, that the Lord accounts not of that prayer which comes not from
the heart.

Oh that men of this world did well consider this, they think that if they
tumble out words of prayer, though their minds wander and are unsteadfast,
though their thoughts be upon other things, though their hearts be transported
with diverse wanderings, yet they pray unto God. But the truth is, that as
Prayer is an Action and Motion of the Heart, so if the Heart do not join in
prayer, though a man use words never so often, he cannot truly say that he does
pray. Nay, I would this were the fault of the world only, that even the good
servants of God did not fail in this: For surely, the best men have their
stragglings and wanderings in prayer. Let a man come to prayer, and he shall
have much ado to hold his heart fast unto God. As the fowls troubled Abraham
in his sacrifice: So a Genesis 13. 11. Fowls.
number of by-thoughts are ready to trouble us in prayer. Wherefore every good
servant of God must accuse himself for this, and pray to God for grace, and
strength to amend it. As Abraham, Genesis 22. 5. used his servants and his Ass to
help him in his journey, but when he Abraham's servants. Genesis 22. 5.
came to Mount Moriah (the place of worship) then he discharged them, and left
them a far off: So worldly thoughts are tolerable and lawful; if we use
them as servants, to carry us through this our journey from Earth to Heaven.
But when we come home to prayer, to present our selves before the Majesty of
God; then we must dismiss, and discharge them. So that this is the first thing
to be observed in prayer, that Prayer is an action or motion of the heart.

Prayer is a motion of the heart, as it is lifted up and elevated unto God with
intentiuenesse and devotion, according to that which David says, Psalm. 5. 3.
In the morning will I direct me unto Psalm. 5. 3. Psalm. 25. 1.
thee, and I will wait: and Psalm. 25. 1. Unto thee, O Lord! will I lift up my
soul, etc. Thus in prayer, there must be always an earnest lifting up of the
heart unto God, that whereas our affections ordinarily dwell here below, by
prayer, they must be carried above Sun and Moon, and Stars, to the very
Throne of grace, to seek things needful at the hands of God. A learned Father
defines Prayer to be nothing but a mounting Damasc. lib. 3. Cap. 24. Fiery
Chariot.
up of the heart unto God. So that prayer is like the fiery Chariot, in which
Elias was transported from earth into heaven: even so by Prayer, we are carried
out of ourselves, out of this world, and all worldly things, to be present with
God in the highest heavens. So that there must be special excitation of the
Heart in Prayer, that thereby we may come nearer unto the Lord himself: which
is the second thing to be observed in Prayer.

The third thing in Prayer is, that we be careful to desire 3 Psalm. 10. 7.
things that be needful, as Psalm. 10. 7. Lord, thou have heard the desire of
the poor, tho^ preparest their heart, etc. and Psalm. 27. 4. One thing have I
desired of the Lord, etc. Psalm. 27. 4.
So Psalm. 38. 9. Lord I power my whole desire before thee etc. So that in every
prayer there must be an earnest desire: whence we may consider two things in
Prayer.

1 A sense and feeling of our own miseries and wants. 2 An earnest desire to
have them supplied.
there must be a feeling and former apprehension of our wants. By which means,
a man shall the willinglier pray for a supply of the same. If we do not find
the Fever, feel the fits, be not pressed with it, as with a heavy burden; no
man will seek to the Physician that is not sick; care for a fire, that is not
a cold; creep to a fountain, that is not a dry: So there must be a sense of
want and misery, before men be induced to pray: The blind men in the Gospel,
cried after Christ, Matthew. 20. 10 and why? because they had a sense of their
own misery, that made them cry. Others Matthew. 20. 10.
should have seen the salvation of God blessed the means of their Redemption
that God had sent into the world. But oh! as men buried in darkness, they
could see nothing: only the sense of misery makes men cry unto God. So Exodus
17. 4. Moses cried unto Exodus 17. 4.
the Lord, etc. the sense of danger thus set him on. O Lord (says he) these
people be ready to stone me, etc. Thus we see, it must be a sense and feeling
of our miseries and wants, which must drive us to prayer.

There must be an earnest desire to have them supplied; for though a man see
his wants, and yet does not regard them, nor wish or endeavor to have them
relieved, this man will never pray to God; so that it is not enough for a man
to have a sense and feeling of his wants, and to bustle under them, and hang
down the head as a bulrush, but he must earnestly desire and seek supply for
them at the hands of God. So Jehoshaphat says, 2 Chronicles. 20. 12. O Lord we be
not able to stand, 2 Chronicles. 20. 12.
but our eyes are toward thee, etc. So Iam. 1. 5. If any Iam. 1. 5.
man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, etc. So that in prayer there must be
a desiring of needful things at the hand of God. For as ground when it is dry,
opens it Ground.
self into clefts and cranies, and gapes toward Heaven, as though it would
devour the Clouds. So must the true Christian be affected in prayer,
earnestly desiring the supply of his wants at the hands of God. Thus it
appears, a man may speak words of prayer a hundred times, and yet never pray
truly, if his heart be not disposed and affected to God. Prayer being (as I
have said) first, a motion of the heart; secondly, not every motion but that
which is elevated and lifted up to the Lord; thirdly, not every lifting up of
the heart, but whereby we desire things needful; fourthly, there must be a
sense of our wants; fifthly, and last of all, yea, chiefest of all, an earnest
desire to have them supplied. And thus, as when many hands lift at a burden.
It is Many hands.
the easier heaued up; so when all these concur together, Prayer is the more
fully made, and the better accepted.

2 General point in prayer.
The second general thing in this Duty of Prayer, is,

Why we must pray?

For though the bare words of Christ might be enough for us, and we should
answer all temptations, as the lame man answered the Jews: John 5. 11. He
John 5. 11.
who healed me, said unto me, Take up thy bed and walk. So we may say, He
who healed me with a plaster of his own blood, He that delivered me by his
own death, and paid the ransom for my sins: ipse dixit mihi: He said to
me, Pray thus, etc. Yet because much subtilty and infirmity lies in the heart
of man, I will a little enlarge my self in this point, though I say this
answer might be enough for us.

First then, there be certain Objections to be answered Why we need not pray:
Secondly, we will show the Reasons, Why we ought to pray.

The Objections that may scale the heart of a man, and put in his heart that he
need not pray, are two:

The first is: Because no man can make any change or Objections against Prayer,
answered. Malac. 3. 6.
alteration in the Lord, Malach. 3. 6. Ego sum Deus, and non mutor, etc. I am
the Lord, I change not. Therefore if we cannot change God with our prayers, to
what purpose is it that we should pray?

I answer, we pray not to make a change in God, for God is unchangeable, but we
pray to make a change in 1 Objection answered.
our selves; that we may be capable of that goodness, kindness, and mercy,
etc. that is in God. A man that stands in the Sun with his eyes shut, If he
desire to have the sight of the Sun, he must not think to have Sun, eyes
shut.
it by making any change or alteration in the Sun, but he must make a change
and alteration in himself; open his own eyes, lift up his own eye-liddes;
and then see the comfortable light of the Sun that shines about him: Even so,
if a man would participate of those precious and rich things that are in God;
the way is not to think by our prayers to make any change or alteration in
Him, but to make a change in our selves, Draw Dionis. cap. 3. de Diuis
Nominibus. Sicut si quis slans, etc.
our hearts and affections nearer unto God. As an ancient Father well observes,
where he most excellently well opens the very same point, etc.

The second Objection is; All things are decreed of God, etc. So that if God
have decreed this or that, then whether we pray, or pray not, It matters not,
for nothing can alter the Decree of God.

I answer as a learned man says; What soever God 2 Objection answered.
has decreed, he has decreed nothing without means to effect the same. For
God has not only decreed the particulars etc. but God has also ordained,
that by such and such means, we should be led unto the ends. Now because
prayer is a means, and a special means to accomplish the Decree of God.
Therefore we must pray, for this does not take away prayer, but confirms it
rather. For example, God decreed to prolong Hezekiah's 2 King 20. 5.
life, etc. and yet the prayer of Hezekiah, was a subordinate means to
accomplish the Decree of God, and serving to that purpose. Take another
example, Acts 27. 31. God had decreed to save all in the ship, but how? by
means of the ship, for when the Master and Soldiers would have fled into the
Boat; The Apostle Act. 27. 31.
Paul told them, that unless these tarried also, they could not be saved. So
to apply this unto our purpose; God has decreed to give such and such
blessings, comforts, and graces to his Saints, and yet not to give them but by
the means of prayer, etc. So that if we will not use prayer, we must not look
for any thing to be either granted or obtained.

Having thus dispatched these Objections, come we to the Reasons, Why we must
pray? First, Because it Reasons why we must pray. Psalm. 50. 15.
is the command of God; that we should pray, Psalm. 50. 15. Call upon me in the
day of trouble, and I will hear thee, etc. So Luke 22. 46. Why sleep ye?
arise and pray, least ye Luke 22. 46.
enter into tentation. And Jam. 5. 13. If any man be afflicted, let him pray,
etc. So that it is a clear Commandment Iam. 5. 13.
of God, that we must pray. Now as we make a conscience of any of the
Commandments of God. So also we must learn to be conscionable in this. There
is no man but will make some conscience of stealing and killing, and why
because he knows God so commands him. Now you see it is the Commandment of
God to pray, let it then be our care to perform it accordingly; and more then
this, it is such a Commandment of God, as that no man can excuse himself, if
he neglect it. And therefore (says Augustine) Thou need not give alms to
the needy, because thou have not Augustine.
where with all to relieve them. Thou need not come into the Congregation
because thou art diseased, thou need not visit the sick, because thy
strength will not bear it; but there is none so poor, so lame, so needy, so
weak in the body, but he must pray; so that if we do not pray, let us look
for nothing at the hands of God.

2 Reason, why we must pray.
Secondly, Because it is the means to convey all the blessings of God unto our
souls; for Prayer is the very key whereby we open all the Treasuries and
storehouses of Gods power and goodness: Christ says. Mark 11. 24. Mark 11.
24.
What soever ye ask of God in prayer, believe, etc. So 1 John 5. 14. This is
the confidence that we have in him, 1 John 5. 14.
that if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us. So that
Prayer is a means to conueigh all graces and blessings unto our souls. The
woman^ of Samaria, John 4. 11. says to Christ, The Well is deep, and John 4.
11.
thou have nothing to draw: but God be thanked, though the Well of Gods
goodness be deep, yet we have somewhat Deep well.
to draw with: the holy bucket of prayer will diue into the depthes of God, and
fetch us waters of comfort from them, yea search the very lowest bottom of
grace that is in God: as diverse of the Fathers August. Ascendit Precatio, and
discendit misericordia. Gregor. Oration in terra: o pater in Coelo etc.
Chrysostom. Hom. 53. ad P. idem. Feeding fountain.
well observe. So that these things are evident inducements to every Christian
man to pray. For as, if there were a goodly fountain, that seeds a whole
town, yet if men have not vessels and pipes to carry water home unto their
houses, they were never the better. So, though there be a Fountain of
goodness in God, yet prayer is the means to conueigh it unto us, and bring it
home unto our souls, etc.

3 Reason, why we should pray. Psalm. 14 4. Isa. 46. 7. Temple robbery.
Thirdly, Because it is the note of a wicked man not to pray, Psalm. 14. 4. David
says plainly, They call not upon the Lord, etc. Isaiah, 64. 7. Notes, that it
was a great sign of the calamity of the Church, when the Chaldeans had taken
away the riches of the Temple, and the daily sacrifice ceased. Even so it is a
sore sign of Gods displeasure, when the daily sacrifice of prayer cease. It
is with a Christian then, as when the Chaldeans had taken the Temple. For then
the Devil does dangerously possess the heart of a man, and carries it quite
away from God, as a child is carried in ones arms, and Child weak.
laid wheresoever the stronger party lists.

4 Reason, why we must pray. Iam. 4. 2.
Fourthly, Because all our labors and endeavors are but in vain without
Prayer, as Iam. 4. 2. Ye fight and war and get nothing, because ye ask
not, etc. So that all our labor is lost, if we have not prayer to attend the
same. Thus we see Abraham's servant, when he went about a business of his
Masters, prayed unto the Lord, Lord send me good speed, etc. And Isaac having
sent his servant about a wife, he in the evening went out into the field Genesis
24. 12. and 26.
to pray unto God: as knowing all his labor was nothing without the Lord. Now
these goodly examples are for us to follow; that whenever we stand in need of
any blessing, we should power out our prayers unto God. A certain man, we
read, once sowed good seed, Seed sown.
but never could have any good corn, at last a good neighbor came unto him,
and reasoned what should be the cause, he sowed so good seed, and reaped so bad
Corn? why truly said he, I give the land her due, good tillage, good seed,
and all things that be fit: why then (replied the other) it may be you do not
steep your seed: no truly, said the other, nor never heard that seed should
be steeped. Yes truly, said the other, but I will tell you how? It must be
steeped in Prayer; when the party heard this, he thankt him for his good
counsel, put it home to his conscience, reformed his fault, and had as good
Corn as any man. Thus have we heard of the Commandment to pray; the first
maine point in the Preface.

New come we to the second maine Branch, which is,

Our Direction how to pray.

Wherein, there are two things to be considered.

1 Why Christ gives this Direction? 2 What the Direction is.
For the first, why Christ gives a direction, there be three Reasons of it.

1 Reason why Christ gives a direction to pray. Luke 11. 1.
First, To help the weakness of such as cannot pray: This reason is touched,
Luke 11. 1. where when Christ ceased praying, one of the Disciples came unto
him, saying. Master, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
Whereupon Christ delivered this form of prayer to them. So that as I say, It
was to help the weakness of such that are not able to utter their own
thoughts and desires. Therefore Christ, as he puts good thoughts in our hearts,
by his holy Spirit: so here he puts good words into our mouths; yea the words
of prayer. So the Lord, Hos. 14. 3. Having exhorted Hosh. 14 3.
the people to repent, puts the very words into their mouths saying, Take unto
you words, and turn to the Lord, and say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and
receive us graciously, so will we render the calves of our lips. In Genesis 47.
12. It is said of Joseph that he nourished his Father Gen 47. 12. Joseph's Piety.
and his Mother, and all the household; yea, put meat into little childrens
mouths. So does the true Joseph, the Lord Jesus, he does put even meat into
the mouths of his children; that is, he does put the very words of prayer
into the mouths of such as cannot pray.





2 Reason why Christ gives a direction to pray.
The second reason why Christ gives a direction to pray, was, To correct a
number of errors, and obliquities that be in prayer. This is the reason that
is given, both in this place, and chap. 7. where Christ says, Be not as the
Heathen, but after this manner pray ye, etc. So the Lord prescribes this
form of prayer, as a correction of the abuses and corruptions which otherwise
might creep Romans 8. 26.
into our prayer. Saint Paul says, Romans 8. 26. For we know not how to pray as
we ought, etc. For howsoever we can speak wisely in the ears of men, yet we
are the veriest fools in the world when we come to speak unto God. And so (as
I have said) to help the errors and defects of prayer, our Savior Christ has
given us a direction how to pray; for as Cyprian says, He who has given
life, has also taught us how to pray. Divines Cyprian.
show, that the inward intent without the action, is as much as the action it
self, for though the action be good, yet if the manner be not so also, God
will not accept it. Isai. 58. 3. The people say, We have fasted Isa. 58 3.
and punished our selves, etc. but the Lord says, Ye fast to strife and
debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness, etc. So though that the
action be good, yet because the manner of performing it was not, God did by the
Prophet reprehend it. So 1 Chronicles. 15. 13. David's 1 Chronicles. 15. 13.
action was good, when he sought to bring up the Arc, but because the manner
was not good, because he did not seek God devoutly, but put God's Ark upon a
Cart, whereas it should have been carried upon Priests shoulders, the Lord
made a breach amongst them, etc. So that we see in regard of gracious
acceptance, the manner of the action is as much as the action it self. And
thus we may not only pray, but we must pray, to acceptance, and keep a due
manner in our prayer.

3 Reason why Christ gives a direction 10 pray. 1 John. 14
The third Reason is, That we might have the greater assurance that God will
hear us when we pray, etc. As 1 John 5. 14. This is our assurance, that if we
ask any thing according to his will, he hears us. Now no man can doubt, that
when we follow Christ's direction, we ask according to Gods will, and so no
question but God will hear us. When the woman of Tekoah made Woman of Tekoah.
a report to David, concerning Absalom his son, David said, Is not the hand
of Ioab in this? which when he understood that it was so, David did the better
accept 2 Samuel 14. 19.
of it: Even so, when a poor Christian comes to prayer unto God, and the Lord
says, Is not this tongue taught by Christ? Is not Christ a counselor in this
action? we may think the Lord will the rather entertain and accept of it.
Saint Cyprian says, As the Lord our Master has taught us: and of prayer. It
is a friendly, and a familiar Cyprian.
kind of prayer, to entreat God with his own words. When any one prays, the
Lord knows the words of his Son. So you see the Reasons, why it pleased
Christ to give a direction in prayer: First, to help the weakness of such as
cannot pray: Secondly, to correct a number of errors in prayer: Thirdly, that
we might have so much the greater acceptance with God.

Now we come to the second thing in the subdiuision.

2 What this Direction is.

Which follows in these words: Our Father which 2 Maine Branch.
art in Heaven, etc. Of this direction there are three parts.

1 The Preface. 2 The Petitions. 3 The Conclusion.
First, There is a Preface, for our Savior Christ does not set down the
Petitions abruptly, but he first begins with a solemn Preface: and why with a
Preface? to show that there must be a provision for prayer, a disposition of
our selves, and a composing of the affections Note.
before we pray. We may not bluntly rush upon this holy Duty; but come forward
with devotion, rejecting all worldly thoughts, and prepare our selves before we
pray, Psalm. 10. 17. Thou preparest their heart, Psalm. 10. 17.
thou bendest ear unto them, Psalm. 108. 10. O God my Psalm. 108. 10.
heart is prepared. So that there must be first a Preparation of the Heart: Now
there be two Reasons, why we must be prepared in our hearts for prayer.

1 In regard of God. 2 In regard of our selves.
That we may come with holy reverence before him; for because it is not a
mortal man, or earthly power, that we have to deal with in prayer, but a
glorious and great God, before whom we ought to tremble, before whom the very
Angels stand with an awful regard and reverence; at the feet of whose Throne,
all Kings of this world cast down their Crowns; therefore so we must have the
more care, how and in what sort we come before him. If a man were to speak to
a mortal King, in a matter of some importance, how would he labor to fit
himself for it: Speech to a King.
to compose his speech, his gesture, all his actions, that there might be
nothing to offend. How much more when we, who be but dust and ashes, worms
meat and rottenness, come into the presence of Almighty God, ought we to be
prepared and labor so to be composed, that nothing offend this great God of
ours.

Because we cannot by and by set up our affections, and stir up our hearts
to prayer, as soon as we have occasion to pray: as when the Sea is moved and
rouzed with the winds, though the wind lie, yet the Sea works still, a good
while after, Seamooued.
before it will be calm: And as in the miracle of the Gospel, the winds were
laid at the words of Christ, which were wont to work and rage a long while
after: So it must be with our thoughts, though we have laid aside our worldly
labor, earthly desires, lusts, and such like; yet some waves are working
still, some thoughts, cares, and cogitations are about us, till we prepare our
selves otherwise. So that there must be a a settling of our affections to
prayer before hand. These be the reasons why it pleased our Lord to use a
Preface to this prayer, to teach us how to prepare our selves to pray, before
we set about it. For, as in a Clock, though A Clo^.
there be many wheels, yet the motions and agitations of all, depend upon the
great wheel: So it is in all worldly business, all these lesser wheels of
our affairs, and cares of this world, must depend upon this greater wheel of
Prayer. Thus our heart being settled and prepared to pray, it carries all the
rest of the thoughts with it.

Again, In this Preface, we are taught three things.

1 To whom we must pray. 2 With what affection we must pray. 3 What be the
duties required of them that pray?
First, we must pray, to God only; For Christ he directs (...)
us to pray unto our heavenly Father: Thus we must pray unto none but Him,
seeing by Christ's own Rule, we are directed unto God only, as in the whole
Scriptures is evident, Phil. 4. 6. In all things let your requests Phil. 4. 6.
be shown to God in Prayer, etc. So Iam. 1. 5. If any Iam. 1. 5.
of you lack wisdom, let him ask it of God. Saint Paul shows the ground of
this, Romans 10. 14. But how shall Romans 10. 14.
they call on him in whom they have not believed? Now by the Rules of Christian
faith, we are bound to believe in none but in God only, and so our prayers to
be directed only unto him. Of which there be two Reasons, why the Lord will
have prayers directed only to himself.

1 Reason why Prayer must be directed to God only.
First, That a man might have an immediate dependence upon God, and not depend
upon any creature: or any power August. lib. de vera Religione. cap. 55.
of Angels, but upon God only: being carried by immediate relation unto God,
as our Savior teaches. So Saint Augustine shows: There is no intermediate
nature betwixt God and man: and so concludes, that we have but one God Almighty
to pray to.

2 Reason why Prayer must be to God only.
Secondly, GOD would have all prayer directed unto him, That he only might be
known to be the fountain of goodness, and the spring of all good things.
For, howsoever by his servants and other means, other blessings and benefits
are conveyed unto us, us, yet in prayer, the Lord will have us go unto him, as
acknowledging him to be the Fountain, and all oother means to issue from him.
For howsoever the Lord afford means, which must be used, yet must God bless
the work, or it will turn to nothing. Saint Paul says, 1 Cor. 3. I have
planted. Apollo watered, but 1 Cor. 3.
God must give the increase. Very Philosophers can say, Secunda causa non
operatur nisi in virtute primae. Second causes work not but by virtue of the
first moouer, as we see in a Clock; if a man will watch the first motion, A
Clock.
and bring it into order, there is no doing with the Leads, or lesser wheels,
but he must go unto the great wheel, to deal with it to order all the rest.
So, because God is the great Wheel of this world, upon whose motion, all
others do depend, sensible and insensible, earthly, and heavenly; If in our
first labor we make our stay upon God, there will quickly be a stay in any
of the creatures that be out of order. And so because all efficacy and workings
in all effects, is from the Lord, and all instruments and means can work no
further then it shall please him to work by them: our Savior would have us
likewise to go only unto the Lord himself, who is the principal agent and
workman for our good.

Bellarmine in the name of all the rest, undertakes 1 Lib. de Inuocatione
Sanctorum. 1. 20.
to clear this: That they do neither pray to Angels, or Saints for any thing,
as the giuers and authors of any thing, but that they should pray for us. But
we see the words of Christ are directly against it, for he says plainly, when
ye pray, pray in this manner: Sic Orate, etc. so pray, etc. not in the Popish
manner: thus Christ, not only prescribes a rule, but also sets down a
special direction unto whom we must pray, as well as in what order, and with
what affection. And August. lib. 114. Enchirid. Maledictus, etc. Chrysostom. Hom.
9. Quand^ orat quis, etc.
for this are all the holy Fathers.

The second thing is, With what affection we must pray: which may be seen by
the two attributes given to God. First, that he is here called Our Father.
Secondly, that he is said to be In heaven.

Now, in that he is called (Our Father) this may teach us two things. First,
That we must pray in faith, 1 Affection, we must pray in.
that is, with an assured trust and confidence, that we shall be heard; for if
God be our Father, we need never doubt, but we shall find loving and fatherly
affection in him, for there is no father so ready to hear the requests of his
children, as the Lord is to hear us in all our desires. So he says, 2 Cor. 6.
vlt. I will not only (says 2 Cor. 6. vlt.
God) take the title upon me, and appellation of a Father, but I will be a
Father, you shall find in me all the affections of a Father, yea, and that more
plentifully, then any father can have. As the Lord will hear us, so upon this
ground, we must pray unto him in faith, that is, with a full assurance that we
shall be heard when we pray. Thus we have it, Iam. 1. 6. If any man ask in Iam.
1. 6. Mark 11. 24.
faith, he shall receive. And Christ himself says, Mark 11. 24. Whatsoever
ye ask in prayer, believe, and ye shall obtain it.



Augustine says, Augustine.
Non audit Dominus ad voluntatem nostram, etc. God does not always hear
according to our will, but in that he knows to be best and meetest for us. As
when a Surgeon lays a Corrasiue. A Corrasiue.
or a burning Iron to a soar, the Patient feeling it to smart, cries out, and
would have it removed, the Surgeon hears him, but lets it tarry, and the
Patient lie still. He hears him to his health and recovery. So says another,
Mothers rub their children there for their Mothers diligence and love.
health, although they rore and cry again: yet for all that they do: not spare
them: and why? it is for their health, etc. So must we think and conceive,
that when God does not hear or grant our requests, he hears so far as it is
for our good, though he do not hear us to our wills. For it is a dangerous
thing to be heard according to our desire. Because thus Christ heard the
Devil, when he suffered him to enter into the heard of swine, or we may say
thus: This is not the greatest mercy to be heard according to our will, but
this, to be heard for our profit, when God gives us that only which is best
for us.

2 Affection we must pray in.
Secondly, That we must pray in love. For Christ instructing us to say (Our
Father) would teach us love and charity; that is, not only to pray for our
selves, but also in the behalf of our brethren; for this is a duty requisite
in our prayers, to take in the whole Communion of the body of Christ, that
every one may have a part in our prayer. So holy men of God have done before
us, David says, Pray for the peace of Jerusalem, Psalm. 122. 6.
Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy Palaces. He prays God
to hear the prayers which he made speaking, Dan. 9. 20.
and praying, and confessing his sins, and the sins of his people. Whereupon an
Angel came flying unto him. Pray one for another in the time of trouble. Thus
by the Iam. 5. 16.
rule of Christ, we must not only pray for our selves in faith, but for our
brethren also, in love and compassion, and fellow feeling of the wants and
needs one of another. When many ships Trade and Traffiicke upon the sea, Ships
trading.
some go for one thing, and some for another, some go to one place, and some
to another; and yet all tends to the good of the Country. So it is in the
prayers of the Saints, some pray for one thing, some for another, some for
grace, some for remission of sins, some for peace of conscience, some for
temporal blessings, and yet all in the end for the good of the Church.

I should now come to speak of the Duties of them that pray: but first I must
a little enlarge my self in the former of Faith and Love, which should have
been touched before.

Faith, being a maine pillar and foundation, whereupon Two grounds of Faith.
this building of prayer consists, yea, such a one as I may truly affirm,
Sine qua non: Ere I go further I will show two grounds of Faith.

1 A persuasion of the power of God that he can. 2 A persuasion of Gods
willingness, that he will help us.
For if we doubt, either of his power, that he cannot, or his will that he will
not help us, though he be able, We can never pray in Faith; that is, with
undoubted assurance that God will hear us. And because the greatest question
is, of the will of God, for not many (especially amongst Christians) I suppose,
doubt of the power of God. Christ first resolves and settles us in that point,
and shows that God is (Our Father,) and because he is our Father, we shall be
sure to find a most fatherly affection in him, that no father shall be so ready
to hear the requests of his children, as the Lord will be to hear us in all
things we pray for. So that this is one ground of our Faith not to think we
come unto God as unto a stranger that does not respect or regard us in our
needs; but we come to him as to a Father and one that does love us, tenders us,
and will be as ready to relieve us, as the dearest friend we have in this
world. So David says, Psalm 103. 13. As a father pittieth his Psalm. 103. 13.
children, etc. And Malach. 3. 17. I will spare them as a Malach. 3. 17.
man spares his own son that serves him. The prodigal son, when he had
slipped away from his father, and naughtily spent all he had, he had no hope to
return with any comfort but this; Ibo ad Patrem, etc. I will go to my Father,
etc. Howsoever I have been a bad and a lewd child, yet I thank God I have a
good Father to go to. This now is our very case: Alas we have run away from
God, as far as ever did the Prodigal son from his father; we have spent
all, we have nothing left by our bad husbandry: only we have this hope and
comfort remaining, that still we have a good Father to go to: God is our
Father, who will hear us, receive us, relieve us, and this (as I said) is the
ground of a Christian man, that he may pray in faith: which thing holy men, in
their prayers have much regarded. Isa. 63. 16. Though Abraham be ignorant of
Isa. 63. 16. and chap. 64. 8.
us, doubtless thou art our Father, etc. and chap. 64. 8. But now, O Lord,
thou art our Father, we are clay, etc. work of thy hands. Yea, our Savior
Christ himself, in this very Preface of Prayer, argues from the very
disposition and nature of an earthly Father, Matthew. 7. 9. Matthew. 7. 9.
For what man is there, if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone,
etc. from whence his inference is: If ye then, being evil, can give good
things to your children who ask, etc. how much more will your Father which is
in Heaven, give his holy Spirit unto those who ask it. So that this needs must
be a goodly comfort unto a poor Christian to consider of, because it is our
Father, not a stranger, our good Father, our loving and compassionate Father
that deals with us, so that we shall easily find him inclined to goodness
and mercy toward us. Many places of Scripture do enlarge this, and all to
strengthen our faith, and make us come the readier unto God, Psalm. 27. 10.
Though my father and my mother Psalm. 27. 10.
should for sake me, yet the Lord will gather me up, etc. Isa. Isa. 49. 15.
49. 15. Can a woman forget her child, and not have compassion upon the son
of her womb? Yea, they may, etc. Where the Lord himself shows, and says
that he will not forget us: so that knowing this love, care and tenderness of
the Lord, and that he has this fatherly affection in him, we may well think,
the Lord will be most ready to hear and help us in all that we pray for.
Alas, they that be not thus persuaded, that God has such a heart, bosom, and
bowels of love open unto us, that he has a fatherly care and compassion
toward us; he, I say, that has not this sweet and comfortable apprehension of
God, that knows not God to be a Father to him, must needs make faint and cold
prayers unto God. But whosoever shall be persuaded in his soul, that the Lord
is become a Father unto him, accepts of him as his son, what is it, but that
such a man may hope for at the hands of God, which (as I said) is the first
ground of our Faith; viz. A persuasion that God will hear us when we pray unto
him.

2 Ground of Faith.
The other ground of Faith is, A persuasion of the power of God: for if he be
willing to help, and yet not able, as wanting power, what are we the better?
but remain even weak people; such as Isaiah speaks of, Chap. 3. 7. In that
day he shall swear, saying, I cannot be an Isa. 3. 7.
helper, for there is no bread in mine house: And it makes us uncomfortable in
that we go about; but Christ shows that all power abides in God, and all
things are subject unto him, whether in Heaven or in Earth, or under the Earth;
yea, he rules and gouernes all, and is able to supply whatsoever man stands in
need of. As may be seen, Psalm. 50. throughout: and Psalm. 115. 3. Psalm. 50.
Psalm. 115. 3.
But our God is in heaven, he does whatsoever he will: and Deuteronomy. 33. 26. There
is none like God, O righteous people, Deuteronomy. 33. 26.
which rides upon the Heavens for thy help, and on the Clouds in his glory,
etc. So that in truth all that he does, is to show forth his goodness and
power in helping us. Of which he has given sufficient testimony in Scriptures,
that he both can and will supply our wants in whatsoever we stand in need of.
Indeed earthly fathers they may be willing to help their children, but they
are not always able, as we may read, 2 King. 9. 14. 2 King. 9. 14.
When the little child cried out to his father, My head, my head; he could do
no more then command one to carry him unto his mother, and so the child died:
but the Prophet came, and by the power of God restored him. So in all things
else the power of God, as it is manifest in things above our reach, so it is
extended even in this world, when it pleases him to fulfill all things that
men can desire. And therefore we see the leper cried out, Matthew. 8. 2. Master
if thou will, thou Matthew. 8. 2.
can make me clean. So David, Psalm. 8. attributes all Psalm. 8.
things to the power of God. Yea, Christ himself, confesses this in his
prayer, when he says, Matthew. 14. 36. Matthew. 14. 36.
Father, Omnia tibi possibilia, all things are possible to thee. So that these
be the two pillars of faith, to aid and give wings to our prayers. A
persuasion both of the will and power of God to help us: thus have we done
with that first affection we must pray with; in Faith,

The second affection we must pray withal, is love; for Christ teaches us to
say (Our Father) and not my Father, (Give us) not me; teaching thereby that we
must not pray for our selves only, but for others also. We must take in the
whole body of Saints, all that love God: all that think God their Father, yea,
all the world that are the children of God. So David, Psalm. Psalm. 122. 6. Iam.
5. 6.
122. 6. says, Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: and Jam. 5. 6, Pray one for
another, etc. So that Christians must not only pray in faith, but in love, and
that for the communion of the whole body of Christ, whereof he himself is a
member: for as the sick man in the Gospel, Sick man. Mark 2. 3.
when he could not come unto Christ (Mark 2. 3.) upon his own legs, though
his faith was great, and that he believed Christ could heal him; was borne
upon the shoulders of four men, who let him down at the house top, and
brought him to the presence of Christ: So must we do by our brethren, howeuer
they can pray in faith themselves, yet must we pray in love for them. If this
course were kept amongst us, that we did thus pray one for another; O what a
comfort would this be to afflicted and distressed souls, to think that
whenever they went about to pray unto GOD, there were many thousand hands and
hearts lifted up to God in their behalf. I am persuaded it would much animate
every Christian to go forward in this Christian duty; thus you may see, how
efficacious this affection of love is, but hereby is not meant every sudden
wish for the good of some particular persons, or private respect of friends,
riuals, allies, acquaintance, or such like, wherein we may exercise our selves;
but the general care of the Church of God, and love to our brethren, as having
feeling of our fellow members.

3 Affection to pray with.
The third affection that we must pray with, is (fear) and that for especial
reasons. First, Because it is our Father that we have to deal with. Secondly,
Because he is in Heaven, the place unto which all Majesty, reverence and
glory is due.

Now we know that all reverence is due to our earthly fathers, yea when they
are sharpest unto us, as Hebr. Heb. 12. 9.
12. 9. We have had the fathers of our bodies which corrected us, and we gave
them reverence, etc. So then if our earthly fathers must have reverence, much
more our heavenly Father; most highly advanced in dignity and power above this
world. Wherefore this is a caution for us, Eccles. 5. 1. To take heed what we
utter before God, Eccles. 5. 1.
For He is in the Heavens. And in another place: We must look to our feet
when we enter into Gods house. For God is not only a Father, but such a Father
that we have to deal withal in Prayer: one so eminent and so high lifted up,
that he is as high as heaven, therefore we must labor as much as may be, to be
abashed and fall down before him. So Abraham, Genesis 18. 2. Bowed Genesis 18. 2.
Genesis 32. 10. Rudinius in Genesis 24. Rebekah.
himself to the ground. So Jacob humbled himself, Genesis 32. 10. To this
purpose, Rudinius in his History upon Genesis 24. says thus. If Rebekah rode upon
the Camels amongst the servants, but when she came into the presence of Isaac
she lighted down from the Camels; So must we do, howsoever in the world we
bear up our heads above our brethren, and are bold and careless when we are
to deal with men; yet when we once come into the Lords presence, and are to
deal with the Lord of heaven and of earth, we must all come down from our
Camels, be as humble, lowly, and base in our own eyes as possible we may. If a
man would conueigh water from a Fountain, if he lay his Leads Water
conueighed.
too high; that is, be not dejected in spirit, stoop in humility be not low in
the Lords sight, he shall be defeated of all the blessings and comforts that he
looks for, so that it must be our care to come into the Lords presence, with
all reverence, Fear, and Humiliation.

But here the Papists do so dazzle men's eyes with the greatness of God, that
they run beyond the mark. On the other side, saying, that sinful men must not
be so bold to approach and come to Gods presence, but they must send a far
off, and send in others to be suitors and mediators for them. But our Savior
Christ shows us, that all this high Majesty of God, must not drive, or chase
us from his presence, but it must only qualify us in our coming unto God,
that we do not rudely and bluntly rush in before him, but that we come humbly
and submissiuely into the Lords presence, abiecting and casting down our
selves, as before a power greater then all the power of this world. It is a
distinction that one has of two sorts of Humility: Humilitas Immediata, and
Humilitas Accepta.

It was a kind of Humility in John Baptist, when he refused Christ's offer,
Matthew. 3. 14. saying, I have need Matthew. 3. 14.
to be baptized of thee, and come thou to me? but Humilitas accepta, was in
Christ's acceptance, that he would have it so: and answered him accordingly.
So it was humility in Peter, John 13. 8. When he said, thou shall never John
13. 8.
wash my feet: but Humilitas accepta, when Christ was content to do it. So in
this case it is a kind of Humility, when we can say, O I am a sinful man, I
dare not be so bold with such a power; but Accepta Humilitas, tells us, we must
do it, we must come at the Lords bidding, at his commandment. So that this
glory of the Lord, must not drive us from him, but we must come of our selves,
and to him alone, and that with fear and reverence.

4 Affection of Prayer.
The fourth affection that must be used in prayer, is, That we must come with
elevation of our hearts and minds as high as Heaven. For seeing God is in
Heaven, our affections must never stay till they come as high as Heaven, where
God is. And so often as we pray, so often in our thoughts, and in our minds, we
must rise higher then the clouds, above Sun and Moon, and all the Stars.
Elias his story shows, that he was carried in a fiery Elias.
Chariot into Heaven, even so must we by prayer be transported out of this
world, to be present with God in the highest heavens. It was a sign betwixt
David and Jonathan, when he shot his Arrows, that if any of Ionathans Arrows.
them fell short, there was no danger in it, etc. So it is not with our
affections, if they be short, and not elevated and carried up as high as
Heaven, there is great hazard and danger, that the Lord will not accept, nor
regard them. Thus have we seen, with what affection we must pray. In Faith, in
Love, with Reverence, with Elevation.

Yet ere we come to the Petitions, we must consider certain duties of them
that pray.

1 Duty of them that pray.
First, We must labor for the grace of adoption. For how ccn we truly call God
Father, if we be not his children? Alas, what do we otherwise, but so often as
we pray unto God, so often continually we do lie in the ears of God. It is like
the aggrauation of Ananias his sin, Act. 5. 4. Thou have not lied unto man,
but unto God. So if Acts 5. 4.
we come unto God in prayer, and call him father, and yet be not his children,
the very same may be said of us, etc. Then you see now, what great cause there
is, that every man should labor for this grace of Adoption in himself, to
repent his finnes, to lay hold upon the promises of the Gospel, to be renewed
by the Spirit of Christ, that we may truly call God Father, because now we
have his true word, if we be his children, he is our Father: yea, we may the
bolder go unto God, and challenge him of his promise, according to that
comfort in Hosea, after so many threatenings, chap. 1. 10. Ye are the sons
Hos. 1. 10.
of the Living God, etc.

2 Duty.
The second Duty is, That we must labor to be persuaded of the fatherly care
and love of God toward us; that we have a Father in Heaven, one that does
respect and regard us. And so whatsoever our estate is in this world; though
never so poor and mean, yet to thank God, that we have our honor with the
Lord, we may come as boldly into the presence of God as the greatest King,
Prince, or Monarch of the world, as Malac. 2. 10. Mal. 2. 10. 1 John 3. 1.
Have we not all one Father? and 1 John 3. 1. Behold what love the Father has
showed on us, that we should be called the sons of God? so that as I say, it is
our honor, comfort, and happiness, that what estate soever we be of in this
world, yet we know, that he who is the Father of Kings, is our gracious and
good Father, by the means and merits of Jesus Christ.

3 Duty.
The third Duty is, that seeing God is our Father, We endeavor to walk worthy
of such a father; that we do not dishonor, and disgrace him by our sins, 1
Pet. 1. 1 Pet 1. 17.
17. And if you call him Father, pass the time of your pilgrimage in fear.
Thus if we proclaim God our Father, then our care must be to walk worthy of
him; It is the blame that God lays upon the Jews, Ierem. 3. 5. Ierem. 3. 5.
Thou have said thou art my Father, and yet thou do evil more and more,
etc. So when men will call upon God as a Father, and yet have no care to please
and obey him, to do his will and honor him with a true heart; O how shall
this one day light heavy upon their hearts, howsoever we do not feel, or
regard it in this world. Thus then, if woe call God Father truly, carry in our
hearts a settled purpose, never to offend him, howsoever our own weaknesses and
frailties put us by; yet the end of our life must be that we walk worthy of
such a father, that is, strive with flesh and blood, as far as possibly we
can, to live in holiness and righteousness, to come to repentance and
compunction of spirit, every day to renew our Covenant, for the amendment of
our sinful lives.



1. PETITION. Hallowed be thy Name.
THey be six in number, whereof the three first concern, The glory of God.

The last three, Our own good.

In the three former, the first prays for the glory of God in it self: the
second and third, pray for the means of his Glory.

First, then we pray for the glory of God in it self that the Lord may have a
holy Name amongst us. The Name of God is most holy in it self, But we pray
that it may be holy unto us, that we may give the Lord glory and honor, which
is his due, as God is a most excellent Meaning
and most high power of himself: so we pray that he be so taken and
acknowledged, all the world over; that the whole world may be ready to stoop
and yield to the excellent and eminent power that is in God. This I take
briefly to be the sense and meaning of this Petition (Hallowed be thy Name,)
that is, Lord that thy Name may be holy in the hearts and mouths of all men.
In the Petition, we are to consider three things.

1 The order of the Petition. 2 The discovery of our own corruption in it. 3
What be the special graces we pray for.
The order is such, that the first thing prayed for, i^ 1 Thing prayed for, the
glory of God.
the glory of God; that he may have his glory and honor, whatsoever become of
all other things of this world: this is the thing we must all care for, that
God may have his honor, may be respected, regarded, loved, feared, etc.
Whatsoever become of all things in the world, which may teach us two things.

there is nothing that we must more desire then the glory of God: We must be
contented to let all go for it, lay down our lives for it, whatsoever become
of us, howsoever despighted and abused yet if God have his glory, be esteemed,
and regarded, it is well. For we see we are here taught to begin all our
prayers with the desire of this, before we pray for daily bread, yea, any thing
else belonging to our selves: Yea, (as one says) Before the Kingdom of God,
we pray for the glory of God: to show that if we could redeem the glory of God
with loss, I say, not of our own lives only, but our own souls, we must
be contented: I could wish my self to be separated from Christ for my
Brethren, etc. as if he Rom 9. 3.
should say, if God may have any glory by it, then I could be contented to
redeem his glory with my life, nay, lose my part of eternal happiness: as
Moses wished, rather then God should be dishonored, to be blotted out of his
Book. Exodus 32. 32.


That we must prefer the glory of God before all other things in this world.
And what end we seek, labor for, plead for, desire or travel for, we must
remember in all to prefer God above all, so that howsoever we can be patient
and quiet in other Cases, yet when it comes to the Case of Gods glory, then we
must begin to rouse and stir up our selves, so as to have all our affections
inflamed in us: as Eliah, 1 Kings 19. 14. 1 Kings 19. 14.
so to say to our selves. I have been zealous for the Lord God of hosts. So
did Hezekiah, when Sennacherib had Isa 37. 34.
sent him a railing letter, he went and opened it before the Lord, as that
which more touched him, when the Lord was dishonored, then when his kingdom
and life was threatened. So Christ himself that patiently heard all the rest of
the Devils temptations, yet when he came to take the honor from the Lord: then
Christ begins to rouse up himself, and chide him. Avoid Satan, Matthew. 4. 10.
It is written, Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou
serve; Thus even against the mightiest, we must stand out for the glory of God.
How lamentable a thing then is it for wicked men, who can let the glory of God
be trodden under foot, and suffer him to be despised, dishonored and blasphemed
from day to day and yet let it pass as a thing of nothing: O how shall we be
able to answer this another day! or give an account for it, when God shall come
to judge us for our sins? We see in the whole course of Scripture, God is
always more ready to stir in our cause, when the matter concerns us, then
when it concerns himself. So dealt he by Caine: The Lord let him go for the
Genesis 4. 7.
wrong he had done to himself, for his bad sacrifice, for his hypocritical
worship; but when he began to malign his Brother, then said God unto him: What
have thou done? The voice of thy Brothers blood cries unto me from the ground.
So dealt the Lord by Pharaoh, he Exodus 3. 7.
was contented to put up all the injuries against himself; his Idolatry, his
blasphemy, and such like: But when he began to stir once against the Church,
and the Lords people, then the Lord opposed him, and when he would not desist
from his cruelty at the last, he drowned him and all his host in the Red Sea.
Now if the Lord be thus ready to show himself, and stir in our cause, then
ought we to be much more ready, and rouse up our selves to stir in his,
against all oppositions whatsoever. 2 The discovery of our corruption.


The second thing considerable in this Petition, is, The discovering of our
corruption in it: that is, a neglect of Gods Name, and an immoderate care of
our own: for when we pray, Hallowed be thy Name; there is a secret opposition
between our name, and the Name of God: we be all too careful of our own
name, to derive the credit and glory of things to our selves: but Lord teach us
to glorify thy Name above all, and before all. Genesis 11. 4. We read that the
people built a Tower Genesis 11. 4.
whose top might reach to Heaven, and all to purchase to themselves a Name, but
not at all to get any Name unto the Lord, or enlarge his glory: but for the
increase of their own. This did Nabuchadnezar in his pride Dan. 4. 30.
aspire to: Is not this great Babylon which I have built for the house of my
Kingdom, and for the honor of my Majesty. So that I say, this is our own
corruption that we so neglect the Name of God in his glory, being so careful
of our own. Thus the Lord complains of his people, Hag. 1. 3. That they built
houses for themselves, Hagg. 1. 3.
went into the woods, fetched home timber, squared it and carved it, to make
houses for themselves, but left the house of God unbuilt. So it is with us in
this case, we can build up our own names, do any thing to grace and honor
our selves, but not one amongst thousands, thinks of advancing of the Name of
God: thus do we all lean too much to the corruption of our Nature; but oh!
why do not the thoughts of David come into our minds. See now I dwell in a
house of Cedar, but 2 Samuel 7. 2.
the Ark of God dwells within Curtains. So say thou, I that am but a worm,
dust and rottenness, I that am but a bulrush, in regard of the Lord God, I
have my glory in the world, I am esteemed and regarded as if some body; But
what care have I of God? must God glorify himself, or not have glory? He that
is so glorious, and affords all the blessings we enjoy, shall not he be
regarded? He that is the Fountain and Storehouse of all things, the glory and
beauty of us all, should not his euer-glorious Name be praised and glorified?
Thus we should learn to take notice of this corruption in our selves.

The third thing to be observed in this Petition, is, The graces that we pray
for. 1 That we may glorify the Name of God. 2 That others may do it. 3 That
though both should fail, that yet the Lord would maintain his own glory.


Concerning the first, we pray here that we may glorify 1 Grace we pray for.
the Name of God, any way whatsoever, that he may have some glory by us: which
must be three ways. 1 In our hearts. 2 With our mouths. 3 In our lives.


For the former of these: see 1 Pet. 3. 15. says he, 1 Pet. 3. 15.
But sanctify the Lord in your hearts: for the second, we have Romans 15. 6.
where the Apostle exhorts them with Romans 15. 6.
one mind and one mouth to praise God: for the other: see 1 Cor. 6. vlt. says
he, For ye are bought with a price, 1 Cor. 6. vlt.
therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit which are Gods. First,
We must inwardly acknowledge 1 In our hearts.
that all things come from God; That we neither have, or can receive any thing
but at the hands of God: we must therefore love and fear Him, trust in Him,
praise Him, and submit our wills to his will: and thus we pray that we may
glorify God in our hearts, when we acknowledge all the power in the world to
be nothing to his: all the wisdom and love in the world to be nothing to his
wisdom and love: when we do labor above all things to keep the Lord to be
our friend, not regarding whosoever be displeased with us, whosoever be against
us, whosoever rages and stormeth, when we see God accepts of our zeal and
Piety toward him; which if we pray for truly, then are we sure to glorify
God in our hearts.

Secondly, We glorify God with our mouths, both by 2 With our mouths.
speaking reverently of the Name of God, and by confessing the Lords wisdom,
goodness and Justice in all his works: for although the Shepherds were
abashed to find Christ in a manger, the King of Kings in so poor Luke 2. 20.
Shepherds.
an estate, yet they returned to their Flocks and Folds, and praised God. So
must we do, whenever we have heard of Gods goodness, or tasted of his
mercy, we must return home to our houses, (as the shepherds did to the
fields) acknowledging the Lords kindness and mercy in it. Yea, what ever
chance, though it be loss and correction, yet we must say as Job did in the
midst of his troubles: The Lord has given, and the Job 1. vlt.
Lord has taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord. So then this is that we
pray for, that of all other things we may give glory unto God: according to
that admonition of the Angel, Revel. 14. 7. Fear God, and give glory Revel.
14. 7.
to him; for the hour of his Judgment is come, and worship him. And again,
Revel. 19. 7. Let us be glad and rejoice, Revel. 19. 7.
and give glory to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come. So that
whatsoever is laid upon us, what change of estate soever the Lord sends, we
must give the glory to God, and confess with our mouths, that he is worthy of
all honor.

Thirdly, We must glorify God in our lives, that we may so live, as the Lord
may have glory and honor by us, 3 In our lives.
and no disgrace, for our good life is an honor to the Lord, as Christ
himself says, Math. 5. 16. Let your Matthew. 5. 16.
light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify
your Father which is in heaven, etc. So 1 Pet. 2. 12. the Apostle says, And
have your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that they which speak evil
of you, as of evil doers, may by your good works, which they shall see,
glorify God. So must we pray, that we do not disgrace the Lord by our sins,
but live so as the Lord may be honored by us. It is for this purpose a good
meditation which one of the Fathers has: God (says he) thus speaks unto a
sinner: O man, if thou have no care of thine own credit and safety, yet have a
care of mine, Think man that I am dishonored by thy sin, for if any
disgrace or shame thereby rest upon thy self, much more upon me whom thou
ought to regard: but if thou could so put it over with iollity and
carelessness, yet is God disgraced by it, therefore O man, though thou neglect
thy self, tender my glory, deface not my honor. Thus it is clear, as our
good life honors God: so our ill life dishonours him: as Romans 2. 24. says the
Apostle. For the Romans 2. 24.
Name of God is blaspemed amongst the Gentiles through you. O then! let us all
take heed of this, that we tender the glory of God: let us pray, that we may
so live in this world, converse here amongst men, that the Lord may be honored
by us, and not dishonored by our gross and presumptuous sins.

For our help herein, There be three things which may 3 Things to quicken our
care of Gods glory. 1 Psalm. 19. 1. Revel. 5. 13. and 14.
quicken us to this duty and care.

First, to consider, That all the creatures do glorify God in their kind: as
the Psalmist speaks. The Heavens declare the glory of God, etc. So in the
Revelation, it is written of all Creatures; That all they which are in heaven,
and in earth, etc. And the four beasts said Amen, when glory was given to the
Lord. Therefore now seeing that all Creatures not only most noble, as Angels
and Spirits, but the very lowest and meanest, yea, the insensible Creatures
give glory to God in their kind: oh how great shall our sins be, and how much
our wickedness aggrauated, if we do not care to bring glory unto him. O with
what gladness should we persuade one another to this duty, that seeing there
is no creature, but in his kind, does in some measure set out the glory of
God, how often should man much more meditate then and practice the same?

That if we glorify God, he will glorify us: we cannot be so ready to set out
the Lords Name and praises, but he is more quick to requite and exalt us: as
it is written, 1 Samuel 2. 30. For them 1 Samuel 2. 30.
that honor me, I will honor, etc. They who despise me shall be despised. Unto
which we may use the words of our Savior, in that solemn prayer, John 17. 4,
5. where he John 17. 4, 5.
thus (amongst other arguments) prays for glory. I have glorified thee on
earth, I have finished the work which thou gave me to do: and now glorify
thou me, O Father with thine own self: with the glory that I had with thee
before the world was. So that when we have glorified God in the time of this
life, then may we assuredly expect that the Lord will glorify us at the day of
death: but if we have no care to glorify him in this world: how can we be
persuaded that he will glorify us, after our departure hence.

That God will severely punish the contempt of his glory: for there is nothing
in this world that he does more tender then his glory. For which he commanded
his people thus: Thou shall not give my glory to another. Yea see for neglect
of this duty, how severely he punished his people, whose carcasses all perished
in the wilderness: because they did not ascribe and give glory to the Lord.
Yea, the hand of God fell upon Moses and Aaron, because they failed in this
duty: Because (said he) you did not sanctify me in the eyes of Number. 20. 12.
the children of Israel, you shall not bring this Congregation into the land
that I have given them. Thus if God will so severely punish the neglect of his
glory in his own dear children and servants, how shall they escape that are not
so dear unto him, and yet are much more faulty in the same kind.

The second part of this Petition, is; that as we pray 2 Part of this Petition.
that we our selves may glorify the Name of God, So we pray that others may
do so also. That the whole world may know and acknowledge the Goodness,
Mercy, Wisdom, Power, and Greatness that is in God. So we are exhorted to
do by the Prophet, Give unto Psalm. 96. 7, 8.
the Lord (the families of the people;) give unto the Lord glory and power,
etc. Give unto the Lord the glory of his Name, etc. Ierem. 23. 16. says he,
Give glory unto Ierem. 13. 16.
the Lord your God, before he bring darkness over the land, etc. So that it
is clear, we must not only glorify God our selves, but also be careful that
others, especially servants and children under us, do the like: as we read of
Job, that because he was jealous of his childrens Job 1. 5.
actions, he offered sacrifice for them: and the Lord himself says of
Abraham, I know that Abraham Genesis 18. 19.
will command his household to serve me. Wherefore let us cast up this account
with our selves, that if of duty and conscience we serve God; it is likewise
our duty to provide that our children and servants do the like. Ye shall find
many men that put away their servants because they be idle, stubborn,
careless, and false unto them: but where is there one that puts a way a
servant because he is a swearer, a blaspemer of the Holy Name of God, a
prophaner of the Sabbath, etc. This shows that we have more care of our own
works and profit in particulars, then of the Lords glory. But true Christians
should take another course, and pray, that above all things, the Name of GOD
may be Hallowed all the world over: being diligent withal, that all under
their charge and government do the like also Again, we pray in this Petition,
That though both do fail, yet that the Lord would maintain the cause of his
own glory. This shows a sincere true affect on to the glory of God, when we
are contented that the Lord should do that which is for his own glory,
howsoever the matter light heavy upon our selves; as Christ said, Father
glorify thy Name, so say we: Lord Job. 12. 2^.
though it be by death, though by my extinction, abolishing, though I suffer
all pains, though I endure the greatest misery that may be, yet glorify thy
Name, whether in life or death. Thus when one can be contended to be exposed to
all the mischiese in the world, all the shame and disgrace that may be, to set
forth the honor of God, if he may be glorified by the same; this shows that
such have a desire of the glory of God, and that this sincere affection comes
from the Lords mercy, being powered into our hearts by his blessed Spirit,
whereby we can effectually cry out: Hallowed be thy Name.

2. PETITION. Thy Kingdom come.
in the next Petition we are taught to pray for the means of his glory; that
the Kingdom of God may come, etc. for then indeed God shall have his glory,
when looking for the Kingdom of God, it comes into our hearts to enable us to
perform his commandments, and that we be always ready to do his will; for
until it be so, God shall have little glory or honor amongst us, so that
first we pray for the glory of God, and then for the means of his glory. It is
the error of the world to desire the End without the means. The glory of God
(which is the End) they would have: But the means of his glory, which is the
Kingdom of God to come, and his will to be done, this, they care not for. The
wicked Jews, Isa. 66. 5. could say, Let the Lord be Isa. 66. 5.
glorified, which is spoken of all those who be worshippers of the true God. So
the Pharisees, John 9. 24. were John 9. 24.
contented to say unto the blindman, Give glory to God, but they would not
allow of Christ the means of their salvation: for, said they unto him, we know
that this man is a sinner, whereby it appears, that the common course of the
world is, to desire the glory of God without the means of his glory.

In this Petition also we may observe three things.

First, when we pray that the Kingdom of God may 1 Sense of the Petition.
come; It is in opposition to another Kingdom that is already in the world:
for the sins of men: The kingdom of darkness, and of the Devil, which is a
great and mighty kingdom, and has a number of proppes and pillars to uphold
it: as for the Kingdom of Christ there be a very small company to uphold it:
but the kingdom of darkness has a number of great ones to sustain it, whole
swarms of people in every corner, one would wonder at the multitude, and at
their conditions. For howsoever men will say, I defy the devil, and
(according to the custom) spit at him, yet as long as they do the will of the
Devil, practicing works of darkness, there is no hope that by their
endeavors they can advance the Kingdom of God; or labor that it should come
upon them. Does not either ignorance or blindness eat up their souls so that
they be either liars, swearers adulterers, fornicators, covetous, drunkards,
contentious, etc. wherein so long as they continue, they be the very proppes
and pillars to uphold and shouldor up the kingdom of darkness and the
Devil. Thus it appears the Devil is a great Monarch, because the greatest
part of the subjects in all Kingdoms serve him, be obedient to him, and
disobedient unto God: they run, as the Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 2. 2. After
Ephesians, 2. 2.
the Prince that rules in the ayrel, even the spirit that now works in the
children of disobedience. So 2 Cor. 4 4. It is 2 Cor. 4. 4.
said, That the God of this world has blinded their minds, etc. For as God
spoke the word and it was done, saying, Let there be light; and there was
light: So the Devil Genesis 1. 15. Light.
cannot so soon speak the word, but by and by it is done, by worldly men. He
can no sooner say, let there be an oath, lie, bribe, quarrel, fashion, or
wickedness, but by and by some one or other puts it in practice.

Thus he rules like a God in this world, a great pity it is, that men should
so be deceived, for God will pull down the Kingdom of darkness, and set up
the Kingdom of his dear son. Yea, this kingdom must first be pulled down,
ere the other be erected. For as in laying a foundation, when one would build a
new house, he first pulls down the ruins of the old, so must House.
he first pull down this kingdom of the Devil, ere that other of Christ be
set up. Wherefore here we pray against this kingdom of darkness that God
would destroy it, for which at this day, there is great need we should so pray,
because the Kingdom of the Devil is like a Sea, which as Philosophers say,
gets in Sea-gaining.
one place, if it lose in another: So is it with it, look how much it has
lost by a defection and revolt from Popery, so much has it (in a manner) got
by the filthy sin of Drunkenness, Irreligion, Pride, Contentions, and other
foul sins of this land, what need have we then to pray, that God would pull
down this kingdom of the devil, and every where set up that of Christ Jesus.

Secondly, In that we pray for the Kingdom of God to 2 Thing observed.
come: It shows, that there are a number of impediments and lets to hinder
this Kingdom from coming. Which are of two sorts.

1 Many impediments in others. 2 Too many in our selves.
Concerning others, we see daily, how men are drawn 1 For others.
by example, by ill counsel, by diverse discouragements, whereby they are
affrighted from seeking the peace of the Gospel: as Matthew, 20. 31. when the
blind men Mat. 20. 31.
cried out on Christ, the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold
their peace, so it is with us in this world, how are we scoft and derided, yea,
chidden again and again. If we serve God in sincerity, and be zealous for the
coming of this Kingdom. See it in the beginning, when the children of Israel
came out of Egypt, how were they hindered and stopped in their Amalecke.
journey. So whenever we shall begin to make after Christ, we shall be sure
of a many lets and impediments: like unto the Pharisees in the Gospel, who
were ready to answer the Officers, and discourage the people from following
after Christ, saying, Do any of the Rulers believe in him, but this people who
know not the Law? Thus it is with the whole swarm of wicked men, who discharge
men from the ways of God.

Again, we have too many impediments in our selves. Self-love, love of the
world, love of riches, honor, 2 Impediments in our selves. John 12. 42, 43.
preferment, and such like, as it is John 12. 42, 43. said of many, that they
believed in Christ: but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, for
they loved the praise of men more then the praise of God. But we must not do
so, for though we sit far in darkness from letting in the light of God unto
us, or howeuer we seem to close up our eyes from beholding the light, yet let
us not be so contented, but pray to the Lord that he would break through all
these hindrances and impediments, and let down his graces of mercy and love
so amongst us, by his grace, that this Kingdom may come upon us, yea, that we
may do as the Palsy man did, who brake through the roof of the house to come
Palsy man.
to Christ; Remembering that the Lord Jesus brake through all impediments and
hindrances, to come unto us and fill us with his blessings, wherein we may
further observe two things, that in Christ's coming to us, and our coming to
him, a number of lettes and hindrances do concuire: yet he has so wrought by
his Spirit, as we can say, Thy Kingdom come; and he so ouercomes all, as he
will at length say unto us, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom
prepared for you, etc.

The third thing prayed for in this Petition, is, That 3 Thing praid for in
this Petition.
we pray.

1 For the Kingdom of grace. 2 For the Kingdom of glory.
Which two Kingdoms differ not in nature, but only in measure and in degrees:
for the Kingdom of grace is nothing else, but a beginning and inchoation of
the Kingdom of glory, there being no way to attain unto the one, unless they
pass through the other. It is a common custom of the world, that most men
aspire to the Kingdom of glory; and yet cannot endure the Kingdom of grace,
how should they ever attain it, think you? we that by Gods blessing, are
better taught, therefore first, pray here for the Kingdom of grace, to be
governed and ruled by the Lord here in this world. But more particularly let us
Definition of the Kingdom of grace.
see what the Kingdom of grace is? namely, The special power of Christ
whereby he rules and gouernes in the consciences and souls of all his
servants. This is the Kingdom which we do pray for, that the Lord Jesus would
set up a Throne in our hearts to rule and govern in us by the rule of his
Spirit, subduing and bringing under all our thoughts and consciences to
himself. Now all men do outwardly speak well of Christ, think sure enough
to be saved by him, but yet cannot endure to be guided and directed by the
Spirit of Christ, but in effect do what those wicked Jews say, Luke 19. 14.
We will Luke 19. 14.
not have this man to reign over us. So it is with most of the world, they can
be content to hear of Christ as a Savior, to have the Word preached, and to
see the Gospel flourish: but they will not have him reign, strictly direct
them in all their actions, restrain them in their passions, and guide them in
their lives: doing whatsoever seems good in their own eyes. Yet ere we
proceed.

Objection, as Luke 19. 21. our Savior speaks, That the Kingdom of God is
come already: how then are we directed to pray for that which is come?

I answer in two respects; first, Esau, Genesis 27. 38. when Esau. Genesis 27. 38.
he saw that his father had blessed his brother Jacob, cried and roared out,
Bless me my father, even me also; thus must we do when we see the Kingdom of
God to come upon others, how God rules in them by his Spirit, orders them in
their lives, directs them in their consciences, we, I say, must pray that the
same grace of God may continually attend upon us.

we pray for an increase thereof, that every day we and others might feel the
power of it more and more in our hearts and lives. For there is no man but
feels himself, in some sort and measure bound and inthralled to the
Temptations of sin. Holy Paul himself complains of this, I delight in the
Law of God concerning Romans 7. 22, 23.
the inner man, but I see another law in my members, rebelling against the law
of my mind. And surely the state of the godly, are like unto a man that has
been deadly sick, and now is so on the mending hand, that he is peradventure
Sick man, Godly.
able to creep abroad with a staff, yet not able to do the tenth part of the
business that he sees he should, and at sometimes was wont to do. Thus it is
with the best of us all, whilst we live here, though the Kingdom of Christ be
come amongst us, yet had we need to pray, that it may more and more come into
our hearts, that we may feel the strength and vigor of it to our endless
comfort, and full recovery of our health in Christ. Yea, great reason there is
why we should thus pray for the Kingdom of Christ, being that no Kingdom is
comparable unto his: there being as much difference betwixt the Kingdom of
Christ, and other Kingdoms of the world, as there is between Heaven and
Earth, and that for diverse respects.

In regard of continuance, for earthly Kingdoms Differences and excellency of
Christ's Kingdom of grace, before all others.
howsoever they begin in glory, yet by and by, both Lord and Crown, and
Scepter, withal their glory falls into the dust: But Christ is a King for
ever, and although he once ware a Crown of Thorns upon earth, yet now he has
a Crown of glory in Heaven, and is in possession for ever: Of whose Kingdom
there shall be no end, as it is, Luke 1. 33.

In regard of the saciety of his Kingdom; For other Kings have but rule over
the bodies, goods, and lives of their subjects, at the farthest. But Christ he
rules and gouerns the very hearts of them, and inclines their wills to effect
spiritual graces, wherein the Kings of the Earth, can neither satisfy
themselves nor their subjects. Christ will give us Crowns, and make us Kings
also.

In regard of the right and Justice of it: For though other Kings being sinners
themselves, can be content to tolerate much sin and profaneness: yet
Christ is so righteous and so just a King, that he will tolerate no sin or
injustice whatsoever, no not in Kings themselves; of whom it is said. Isa. 32.
1, 2. Behold a Isa. 32. 1, 2.
King shall reign in righteousness, and Princes shall rule in Judgment.

In regard of the fruit and commodities of it; for other Kings receive Tribute
from their Subjects, but Christ gives a thousand things more then he receives,
he takes away death and damnation with his left hand, and gives us life and
salvation with the right hand; so both hands are full of blessings, and store
us abundantly to the supplying of all our wants.

In regard of administration and employment of it; for other Kings after they
have entered into their Kingdoms, commonly sit still, go little, live at ease,
or at least, seek by all means they can to maintain the pleasures of their
lives, and give themselves to quietness. But our Savior Christ does most
mightily rule and govern all things for tho good of his servants, watching
over them to do them good, night and day at all times. and in all places,
preventing them with mercies: and working all his works for their good: great
reason it is therefore, that we should pray for the coming of his Kingdom.

Yet we must further know, that we do not only A further scope of the
Petition.
pray for the Kingdom of grace: but also for all good means conducting and
leading unto it, for every thing that may incite and help to the Kingdom of
grace amongst us. As for good Magistrates, Ministers, a pure right use of the
Sacraments: holy discipline of Christ in the Church for the good government
thereof, and for every thing that may further this great work of God amongst
us. So 1 Timothy 2. 1. Saint Paul wills that Prayers 1 Timothy 2, 1.
be made for all men, and for Kings and Princes, and for all that be in
authority: That under them we may live a godly, peaceable, and a quiet life.
And Christ himself, Matthew. 9. 38. commands prayers to be made unto Matthew. 9.
38.
the Lord of the Harvest, that he will send forth laborers unto his harvest.
So you see it is our duty to pray for all the means which may advance this
Kingdom. Worldly men can say, they desire that the Kingdom of Christ may
come, though they care not a rush for Heaven or newness of life, for the Word,
or Saints, or Ministers, or Holy orders of Christ, without which there can be
no Kingdom of Christ amongst us. It was not only a tyranny in Pharaoh, to
take away the straw from Exodus 5. 7. Pharaob.
the people, but also when he had so done, to require of them the whole tale
of Brick, as formerly. So it is the madness of the world, they take away the
Word and the Sacraments, the holy government of Christ, and when they have thus
done, yet they think to have their whole tale of Brick: as much Patience,
Love, Humility, Faith, Obedience, Sobriety, Temperance, and the like; as if all
these gracious and good means were entertained amongst them. But we must
remember what the Scripture says, Where there is no vision, there the people
perish. Therefore whenever we settle our Pro. 29. 18.
selves to remain any where: as little Isaac said to his father, when they
went up to the Mount Moriah: Behold Isaac. Genesis 22. 7.
the wood and the fire, but where is the offering? So should we say wheresoever
we go to dwell. Lo here is a Church, good air, a good house, means enough
to increase wealth: but where is the Preacher? and the means of grace for the
salvation of our souls.

Thy Kingdom come. Let us pray unto God often, that he would rule and reign
in our hearts, so by his holy Spirit: that sin may no longer rule us, nor we
be ruled by our selves, but that God would rule and guide us in all our ways,
so that in all things we may be ready to submit our selves to the holy
government of God: as Saint Paul writes, That the peace of God may dwell in our
hearts Colos. 3. 15. Psalm. 48, vlt.
plenteously: and with David, that God would guide us unto the day of death:
and then this will bring great joy unto us, as Zephaniah speaks, when the King
of Israel Zeph. 3. 15.
is in the midst of us, then we shall see no evil. And withal, let us often
remember to pray, that there be no want of government, but that God by himself
may rule and reign in us, that though the world love looseness, and cannot
endure this kingdom, yet we may be pliable and yielding to be ruled by it. For
as the blindman Blindman.
is best and safest, whose eyes being shut, follows his guide: so is every
Christian when they disclaim their own wit, reason, and wisdom, and are
ruled and guided by God in all things. Yea, the people of God never think
themselves better, then when they be under the government of God, and submit
wholly to his will, and in so doing, let us not be discouraged for our
weakness and wants, for if we endeavor to do this sincerely grace (which at
first in us is like seed, because it must grow, not like straw which cannot
increase) will grow from a little, to greatness of stature, and proportion in
time.

Now there be three Motives to move us to this subjection to the will of God.

If we will not have God to be our King, we shall be subjects and slaves in a
worse Kingdom: as the Lord speaks by Moses, to persuade them to admit of Gods
Kingdom: Because thou have not served the Lord thy God with ioyfulnesse and
with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things, therefore shall thou
serve thine enemies Deuteronomy. 28. 28.
which the Lord shall send against thee, in hunger, thirst and in nakedness,
and in want of all things. So the Lord threatens his people with captivity, 2 Chronicles. 12. 8 for their sins, saying, Nevertheless, ye shall be his
servants, 2 Chronicles. 12. 8.
that ye may know my service, and the service, of the Kingdoms of the
Country: So that if we will not be Gods servants, we shall sure be subjects and
slaves unto a tyrannous kingdom, a kingdom of many Lords: of which a Father
speaks: Oh how many Lords have Ambrose. o quam multos habent Dominos, etc.
they, etc. For if God be not our King, then every foul lust, sin, and
temptation, will be our King to rule and govern us at their pleasure.
Therefore it is best to say with holy David, Lord I am thy servant, etc. So I
would Psalm. 116.
have every good Christian say, I have no lord to rule over me but Jesus
Christ: Come Lord and possess me for thine own.

Because of the comfortable fruits thereof, Paul says of this Kingdom, that
the fruits thereof are Righteousness, Peace, Joy in the Holy Ghost; so that
there is much comfort for a man to live in this Kingdom. We see that all the
people of God, who most, or at all yielded to Gods government, to set him high
in their hearts, they always passed so much the more comfortably their time in
this world: And again, the more any of them withdrew themselves from this
government of God, they became always the more distressed and miserably
perplexed with troubles and dangers. So David says, As for me, it is good for
me to Psalm. 37. vlt.
draw near to God. So Hosh. 2. 7. the Church is brought Hosh. 2. 7.
in thus resolving: I will go and return to my first husband, for at that
time was I better than now. So must we say, when we have gone astray; It was
much better with us, when we dwelt under the government of God, therefore we
will return to that good government again. A Tenant, you know, as long as he
pays A Tenant.
his rent, and does suite and service to his lord, all is peaceable and quiet
with him, nobody can molest him, but if he deny to pay his Rent, and do no
suite or service to his lord, then the Bailiffes will be busy to arrest and
strain his goods, yea many times to ceaze on his body: Even so as long as we
pay the Lords Rent, acknowledge his government, be ready to do suit and
service unto him, so long we shall find all peaceable and quiet, but if we
fail in our duty, then must trouble and mischief come upon us.

Because the Kingdom of grace, is the only roadway to the Kingdom of glory;
No man when he is dead can come to reign with God, unless God first reign in
him, being alive in this world.

We see no man can enter into a City, unless first he Cit^e.
pass through the Suburbs thereof. So Heaven is the great City of the Saints,
they all seek and aspire to; the Kingdom of grace is the Suburbs thereof, by
which we must pass: therefore there is a necessity to be in the state of grace
here, ere we can hope to reign with God in glory hereafter.

The next thing we pray for in this Petition, is; For 2 Thing we pray for, is
for the kingdom of glory. Cant. 2. 16.
the Kingdom of glory: that God would make an end of the Conflicting days of
sin, and hasten the Kingdom of his dear Son, the Kingdom of glory. So
the Church prays. Return my Beloved, and be like a Ro^, or a young Heart upon
the Mountains of Baether: So in the Revelation, Come, Lord Jesus, Come
quickly; and Saint Revel. 22. 20. Romans 8. 22.
Paul shows, That all the Creatures do groan for this happy day of Christ's
appearance: So that here, in the second place, we pray that the Lord would
abolish and darken all the Kingdoms of this world: amongst Impertinent.
whom the holy Ordinances of God appointed unto them for peace, are abused to
their condemnation. So in Daniel, This Kingdom of Christ is compared to a
tree, under the shadow whereof, the beasts of the Dan. 4. 8.
field might rest, and the birds of the air find shelter; Therefore the
Apostle says, It is ordained of God, so Romans 13. 1.
that though we have no cause to murmr or grudge at the kingdoms of this
world, but to thank GOD for them, yet we must know every state has his
abuses, and so have these. But as a lame man in a garden, though Lame man.
he cannot do that work which one that is perfectly able to walk can do,
yet he serves, and is useful to speak, direct, and fray away birds, keeping
much annoyance from the fruit thereof, which otherwise might be lost. So it is
with worldly governments and states, though they be not so well ordered as they
might be, yet no body can deny, but they fray away enemies, many dangers, and
many ravenous birds that would else devour up the fruits of our labors.
Therefore we pray not for the Kingdom of Christ in any detestation to these
earthly kingdoms, but only because we prefer the Kingdom of Christ before
them. We thank God for the Kingdoms of this world, but we would much more be
thankful for the Kingdom of Christ. As men that use a Coach to bring them to
a house, as soon as they come there, send away the Coach, as having no A Coach.
more use of it: So the Kingdoms of this world, be but as Coaches, helps and
furtherances to transport and carry us to a better Kingdom, the Kingdom of
Christ: where being arrived, farewell all the Kingdoms of the world.

The reasons why we prefer, and especially pray for the Reasons why we pray,
especially for the kingdom of Glory.
Kingdom of glory are diverse. Because in these earthly Kingdoms, most of us
are subjects and inferiors, but in the Kingdom of glory we shall be all
Kings, no King in this world can be so glorious, but the poorest and meanest
Christian there shall be as glorious as he; as Christ speaks, Matthew. 19. 28.
Uerely I say unto you, Matthew. 19. 28.
that ye who have followed me in the Regeneration, when Iuke 22. 50.
the Son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory, yea, also shall sit
upon twelve thrones, Judging the twelve Tribes of Israel.

Because many grieuances and annoyances are in these earthly kingdoms; even in
the best of them, some Gall mingled with Honey, some Aloes with the Manna, some
bitterness with the sweetness of them. Therefore as the people could say of
Salomons Kingdom (which was one of the best) that it was but a yoke, and too
heavy for them to bear: so the best is but a yoke, and many times a heavy
yoke too, but in the sweet Kingdom of Christ, there shall be nothing
offensive to us; as it is said of the Angels at that day: And they shall
gather out of his Kingdom all things that Matthew. 13. 4^.
offend, says our Savior. So it is said, There shall be no Revel. 21. 4.
Bees.
more sorrow. Bees we know be driven from their Combs and Honey with a
little smoke; even so the vexations, puthers and smoakes, which we find on
these earthly kingdoms, should make us all long for that happy Kingdom of
Christ, wherein there shall be nothing to annoy us.

Because earthly Kingdoms, they yield us peace and tranquillity, but for a
time only; for either they end or we end, and so all comes to nothing; But our
happiness in Christ's Kingdom shall be for ever and ever: for when we have
lived a hundred thousand thousand years in the full inioyment of it, we have
more and more and more ages without end to possess it: therefore Heb. 12. 28.
it is called a kingdom which cannot be shaken; good reason then have we Hebr.
12. 28.
whose eyes he has opened to behold this kingdom, to pray especially and
groan for it.

Now there be two ways, whereby the kingdom of God may come unto us.

1 Generally at the day of Judgment. 2 Particularly, at the day of our own
death.
We pray for both these: First, that God would be pleased to sold up the
times, make an end of this 1 Thing we pray for.
world, hasten the great coming of his dear Son: Thus the Saints cry under
the Altar; How long Lord Revel. 6. 10.
Holy and true: do thou not avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
We know this kingdom of Christ cannot come, but first there must be a
dissolution of this world, when all the glory thereof must turn to nothing:
(as Peter speaks) The Earth and all the 2 Pet. 3. 10.
works thereof shall be burnt up. God forbid therefore that the world or any
thing in it should make us loath to come to Heaven: rather let us be contented
to suffer the loss of all, so we come thither to enjoy this happy and blessed
kingdom of the Lord Jesus, for which we are commanded to pray. Which as we
pray for, so must we be careful to fit and prepare our selves for it, that
when it comes, it may come to our comfort, we all pray, Thy Kingdom come.
But know, O man, if thou have not fitted and prepared thy self for it, if thou
do live in thy sins, if thou have had no care, nor regard of reconciling
thy self to Christ, for thy salvation, if thou have not been thoroughly washed
over and over in the blood of the Lamb; Oh whenever this kingdom comes, I
foretell thee in the Name of the Lord it will come to thy cost, to thy ruin
and utter desolation in the day of Christ.

Therefore consider of this, all ye that live in known sins without
repentance: yea, pray (I say) that the Kingdom of God may come, and oh, what
have you to do with the day of the Lord: This coming shall be sorrow, woe,
confusion, darkness, nay, Blackenesse of darkness, and tempest unto you for
ever, and reiection from the presence of CHRIST: but if you would have comfort
of CHRIST'S coming, live well and be prepared for it with the Wise Uirgins,
having Oil in your Lamps, and your Loins girded.

life, savor nothing but of earth and earthly contentments: the true mortified
Christian professes another thing, he desires to leave all and go home to
Christ, as soon as may be; So Job, If a man dye, shall he live again? All the
days of my appointed time will I Job 14. 14.
wait till my changing shall come, etc. and Paul, Philip. Phil. 1. 23.
1. 23. professes, I desire to be loosed, and to be with Christ, which is
best of all.

It is true indeed, that no man may desire the day of death out of
coffeehouse with life, because of the trouble and crosses of this world: It
was Jonas fault to do so yet in two respects, one may pray for death, yea his
own death.

First, That we may make an end of sinning and offending GOD, that whereas he
every day breaks out Respects to pray for death. 1
in the dishonouring of GOD, which vexes and grieves him, he may pray the Lord
to shorten these days of sin: with abatement of our days, so finishing our
offenses, as Saint Paul does: O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?

That we may enjoy the blessed fruition of the presence of God, as his holy
Angels do.

Moses you know, desired but to see the back parts of God on the holy
mountain, for he could not see his face and live.

If Moses so desired to see but a glimpse of his glory, as it were through a
creuice or a chinke; how much more excellent will be the shining of his face in
full glory? therefore because every day we live in this world, we lose a day
in Heaven, as detained from him, who is our true life indeed: we may therefore
pray, that as soon as may be, we may finish up our course in this world, and
cry to be away, to go home to the house of our Father, to the possession of a
better life, the Kingdom of Glory, and happiness prepared for us, for which
we are taught to pray. Thy Kingdom come.

3. PETITION. Thy will be done even in Earth as it is in Heaven.
We have heard before, that in the first Petition, we pray for the glory of
God, and in the second, for the means of his glory, that is, that the kingdom
of God may come into our hearts, and rule us by his Spirit. Now in this third
Petition we pray that we may be contented to submit unto it, and be always
ready to do the Lords will, and not our own. So that whereas in the former
Petition, we prayed for the inward government of God, the work of grace, holy
motions, striuings in our selves, that the Lord would do his part; now we pray
that we may be willing to do our part, not resist this inward government of
God, be ready ever to yield obedience unto it. All the Question (as one says
very well) betwixt God and us is, whose will shall be done, Gods will should,
but man is unwilling to have it so, but aspires to have his own will for the
rule of his actions, this is that which breeds all the quarrel betwixt God and
us: Now our Savior Christ, he teaches us in this Petition, to give all the
Souerainty to God, to take his part against our selves, praying to do his
will, whatsoever may befall us in this world: Thus have we the sum of the
Petition, in which, three things are to be considered.

1 Whose will must be done? Gods will. 2 What will of God we must do? His
revealed will, that is, the will of God revealed in his Word, his secret will
being a thing reserved to himself, the other, quo ad nos, belonging unto us,
to follow as the rule of our actions.
3 In what manner we must do it? As the Angels do in heaven.
Concerning the first, Whose will must be done? It is the will of God, that
will is it we all pray that we may 1 Whose will must be done?
do, obey, submit to it in all our actions, and courses of life, so that this
will of God may be the only rule of our wills: Thus David professes: I desire
to do thy will Psalm. 49. 8.
O God: And again, he prays: Teach me, O Lord, to Psalm. 143. 10.
do thy will. As if he should say, I need no body to teach me to do my own
will, but Lord instruct me that I may do thine. So the Apostle Peter exhorts
us for holy life, Not to live any longer in the flesh to the lusts of men, 1
Pet. 4. (...).
but to the will of God: So that Gods will must be the Ruler and Moderator of
our wills, all our days, bringing our will to Gods, and not Gods will to ours,
as Balaam did. To this purpose Saint Augustine says well on Psalm. 44. 6. If a
man lay a crooked stick upon an even Crooked stick.
level ground, the stick and ground ill suit together, but the fault is in
the stick. In this case thou must not strive to bring the even ground to the
crooked stick, but bow the crooked stick even with the ground: So it is
between Gods will and ours, there is a discrepancy and iarring betwixt them,
but where is the fault, not in the will of God, but in our crooked and corrupt
affections: in which case, we must not seek to bring Gods will unto ours, but
be contented to rectify and order the crookedness of our will by the
rectitude and Sanctity of the will of God, which must be the rule of our
wills; for which cause we pray, Thy will be done, etc.

Now this will of God is opposed to three other wills Will of God opposed by
three other wills. 1
which be in the world: First, the Devil has a will, which is ever a crossing
the will of God. God would have us do one thing, and the devil would have us
do another. If once the will of God be known, by and by, it is easy to know
the Devils will, because it stands in a mere contrariety and opposition to
the will of God.



Adam, we see, when the will of God, and the will of the Devil hung up in an
equal balance by him, how soon was he ready to be guided by the Devil,
rather then to obey the will of God. And so the best of us, howsoever we pray
daily, Thy will be done; yet what a stir have we to bring our hearts unto it,
how gladly would we take a contrary course if we might, and have Gods will
another way of our own?



Put away lying. But the will of the Ephesians. 4. 25.
Devil is lying, as it said of Ananias, Act. 5. 3. Why Act. 5. 3.
has Satan filled thine heart to lie? So it is of swearing and other
prophannesse, which is not the will of God but the will of the Devil. The like
we have, Hebr. 12. 16. Hebr. 12. 16.
Let there be no profane person, as Esau, amongst you, etc. and so in all the
rest. So long therefore as we live in our sins against conscience, and will
not repent of them and amend our lives, so long as we be thus given over to
wickedness, our wills stand in subjection to the will of the Devil: as Christ
said to the Jews, Yeeare John 8. 44.
of your Father the Devil: So he who does the works of the Devil, without
doubt is at his subjection; this is the first thing we pray against, that we
may not do the will of the Diuill.

Secondly, There is a will of the flesh, as the Apostle calls it, Ephesians. 2. 3.
The fulfilling the will of the flesh. Against 2 Ephesians. 2. 3.
this will we pray also, and that we may be enabled to bring our will in
subjection to the will of God: for which there be two maine reasons; Jews
said, Ierem. 44. 16. The word that thou have spoken unto Ierem. 44. 16.
us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hear of it of thee. So John 5. 40.
Christ complains of the Jews: But John 5. 40.
you will not come to me, that ye might have life. And Psalm. 36. all the
Psalms show so much, so that the will of man is apparently rebellious, till
God alter and change it by the power of grace. Therefore we pray that our will
may be ouermastred by the power of grace, so as to submit to Gods will.
Secondly, because Gods will is always better then our will. Adam would needs
have his own will in eating of the forbidden fruit, but I pray you whose will
was the better? Thou shall not eat: but man's will would needs eat. Now
(considering the curses which came after) any fool can tell which was the
better. The Mariners, Act. 27. 1^. would needs have their own will, when Acts
27. 12.
they might have been in a safe harbor and sure Haven, they would needs put
forth to Sea, well they did Mariners.
so, but what was the end thereof? they all suffered shipwreck and hardly
escaped with their lives, though Paul told them of the danger: so is it with
us, for the most part we will have our own wills, though we miscarry in our
courses: and then we are feign to tell you (as Paul did the Mariners) O my
brethren, you should have hearkened unto the Lord, and obeyed and kept close
unto him, and so have shunned this loss,

Peter and John answered boldly to the Jews, Whether Acts 4. 19.
it be right in the sight of God to obey you rather then God, judge you. So the
three children commanded to fall down before Nabushadnezars golden Image,
answered likewise: Be it known to thee, O King! that we will not serve thy
gods, nor worship the golden image which thou have set up. So that I say,
whatsoever the will of man commands, we must always look to the will of God,
and hold our selves unto it, as the only rule of all our actions and courses:
Thus when we pray, Thy will be done, it is in opposition to these three wills.

1 The false and wicked will of the Devil. 2 The corrupt and crooked will of
the Flesh. 3 The perverse and abusing will of the World.
So a true Christian in all estates ought to pray, Lord grant that I may not
guide my self by these wills, but that I may be always ready to be directed
by thy will: And so I have done with the first point, Thy will be done.

2 Thing, what will of God must be done.
The second thing to be observed in this Petition, is, What will of God must be
done? Not the secret will, but the revealed will of God in his Word; for herein
the Devil uses great art and cunning, contrary to Gods will to buzze in men's
heads, many intricate and secret things, under the color of art and deep
necessary knowledge, leaving the principal matters and maine points. But we
must know, that it is the revealed will of God, not his secret will must be the
rule of our lives. As God speaks to Moses, Deuteronomy. 12. vlt. You shall do Deuteronomy.
12. vlt. Psalm. 119. 105.
only that I command you. And Psalm. 119. 105. It is said by the Prophet, Thy
Word is a lantern to my feet, and a light to my paths. Thus whatsoever the
secret will of GOD be; let us always hold to that will of GOD revealed in his
Word: doing as Mariners when they Mariners.
are at Sea, who when they have no direction to sail by, cast up their eyes to
heaven, and are altogether directed by the Pole-starre: So must we do in all
our Pole-starre.
actions, think of no other guide or direction, but the bright star of the
holy Word of God, which will safely conduct us to the heavenly City. Wherefore,
because this will and Word of God, must still be looked upon as our Compass,
let us labor to know it, and be acquainted with it, that we may be fitted to
be advised by it. To this purpose Christ says, John 5. 39. Search the
Scriptures for they are they which testify of me: Unto John 5. 39.
which Saint Paul adds, That they are able to make us wise unto salvation:
and Josh. 1. 8. he says, Let not Josh. 1. 8.
this book of the Law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day and
night, etc. Most men, you see, will have a book of Statutes in their houses,
and if they be to do any great matter, they will do nothing before they
Statute book.
look on their book; even so, because the Bible is the Book of Gods
Statutes, the best men should get this book into their houses and read it
themselves, or get others to read for them, that thereby they may first know
the will of God, and then practice to perform it. Whereby you see what a great
fault it is amongst us, that such a Christian duty is so much neglected.
Therefore let us labor to correct this corruption in our selves, and so pray
that we may do the will of God: first, laboring to know it, and afterward
putting it in practice. Now, as depending upon this,

There are four special wills which God requires in his Word.

It is the will of God that we should be penitent for our sins: to which
end God speaks by the Prophet Ezekiel, As I live, says the Lord God, I desire
not the death Ezekiel. 33. 11.
of a sinner, but that the wicked turn from his way and live, etc. So 2 Pet. 3
9. It is said, God is patient toward us, 2 Pet. 3. 9.
and would have no man to perish, but that all men should come unto repentance:
so you see it is the will of God that we should repent us of our sins, that
how soever we cannot do our duty, live as we should, yet always to grieve at
our hearts, be wounded in our souls, that we have offended God, and cannot do
as we ought. They say that wounds which bleed, will the sooner Bleeding wounds.
heal, but when a man has a grievous wound, and does not bleed, there does
usually great danger follow. So it is in a wounded conscience which bleeds:
when we are sorrowful, lamenting, weeping, mourning, and meditating of our
sins, then comfort follows, but when no remorse or repentance follows for
sins which offend God, this is very dangerous.

Secondly, It is the will of God that we believe in Christ: 2 1 John 5. 23.
As 1 John 5. 23. This is the Commandment, that we believe in the Name of his
Son Jesus Christ. For though we be sinners, and infinitely guilty in our
selves, yet it is the will of God, that we should lay hold upon the promises of
Grace, and embrace life and salvation offered unto us in the person of his
dear Son. Men in a shipwreck, be glad to lay hold on any thing that may
bring them to the shore; so must we do in the dangerous shipwreck of our
souls, cast both our arms Shipwreck.
about Jesus Christ crucified, and killed, that he may bring us safely to our
heavenly Country.

It is the will of God that we should live a sanctified, and a heavenly life,
here in this world. As 1 These. 4. 3. This is the will of God, even our
sanctification: for because he is willing to come amongst us, and remain with
us, he would have us forsake our sins, and keep both body and soul, as a
pure Temple for his holy Spirit to dwell in; for if Balteshazzar was so
severely punished for abusing the vessels of the Temple, dedicate unto GOD:
what shall we be, if we defile and contaminate the Temple of the Holy Ghost.

It is the will of God that we bear patiently and quietly, all the crosses and
troubles that God sends us: as Peter says, It is better (if the will of God be
so) that ye suffer for well-doing, then for euill-doing. And so because this is
also a part of the will of God, compose your selves quietly and meekely to
undergo the troubles and crosses that God sends.

Thus Christ prays, Luke 22. 42. Let this Cup pass Luke 22. 42.
from me, nevertheless, not my will but thy will be done. So says David, in
that great cross of his chasing from the Crown: Behold, here am I, let him
do unto me what seems good in his eyes. So when we pray (Thy will be done)
the special care is to consider of these four things: which if we pray for,
let us labor by all means to perform the same; for what a strange thing is
this for a man to come before GOD in prayer, to lift up his hands and eyes unto
heaven, entreating that God will may be done, and yet have no care to do it,
being unwilling to repent of sins, and to lay hold on the promises of Christ?
to which purpose it was a weighty speech of a learned man: We may as well spit
upon CHRIST, buffet Him, beat Him with rods, bow before Him, with cursed
mocking, say, Hayle King of the Jews, etc. as kneel in His Church, in our
Pew, and say (Thy will be done) and yet never have any care to do it; but
grieve God with our sins add wickedness to wickedness, day by day, never
thinking of reconciling our selves, and examining our hearts and consciences,
toreformation and newness of life.

The third general part of this Petition, is: In what 3 General thing in the
Petition.
manner we must do the will of God? You see we pray that we may do it in
Earth, as they do it in Heaven, that is as the Angels and blessed Spirits do
it which are in the presence of GOD, and the reason of this is, because (as we
have heard before in all duties) the manner of a thing (in regard of grateful
acceptance) is as much as the thing it self.

As if one build a man a house, yet if he do not build House.
it to the mind of the owner, if it be too high or too low, too wide, flat,
or such like, he thinks all his charges lost.

So if one plough a field, what is all his labor and Field Ploughed.
pains, if it be not to the will of his Master? So in holy duties, howsoever
we do the will of God, yet if we do it not in such and such manner as God
prescribes, he will not accept it. Yea, Schoolmen say, that the Modus rei
cadi^ subpraecepto.
ground of this is, because The manner of the thing is as well commanded as the
thing it self. So Jeremy, Cursed be he who does the work of the Lord
negligently. Though it be the work of God, yet cursed is he, yea, (so much
the more) if he do it negligently, not in such sort as he should.

It is said of Noah to his praise, that he not only did all things, but also
in the very same sort and manner as the Lord had commanded. Moses was commanded
Heb. 8. 5.
to do all things according to the pattern showed him in the Mount, this is
that we pray for in the last clause of this Petition.

In which two things are especially to be considered.

1 Why the Lord fetches us a Pattern from Heaven, and not rather from good
men in this world? 2 How, and in what manner the Angels do the will of God?
Concerning the first, There are four special Reasons of it, why the Lord
fetches us a Pattern from heaven, rather then from Earth.

First, Because a rare example does most move us. Few examples in this world be
rare, and those few that be, David says, The Lord looked from Heaven, and saw,
that none did good, no not one. So Isa. 64. 6, 7. the Prophet brings in the
Psalm. 14. 12. Isa. 64. 6, 7.
people confessing, We have all been as an unclean thing, and our
Righteousness is as filthy cloutes, etc. And he concludes, for there is none
that stirs up himself to call upon thee. Yea, also of this Saint Paul
complains, affirmatively, Philip. 2. 2. For all seek their own, and not
Philip. 2. 2.
that which is Jesus Christ's: So because there is such a rarity of good
examples in this world, therefore our Savior Christ sends us as far as
Heaven, to take our example from thence: as Mariners on the Sea, who are
Mariners.
always guided by the Stars, because they want in the Sea firm marks to
direct them home to their own Country. So must we do, because we want firm
and sure examples in this world, to raise up our thoughts by into heaven and
mount us beyond the clouds: we must take our pattern from those blessed
Spirits and powers that continually do serve in the presence of God.

because those few examples that are in the world, be not pure and perfect,
but have their defects. Saint Paul (as I have said) likeneth the examples of
holy men, to the cloud that led the people out of Egypt, which had two parts,
one bright, another dark, somewhat to be followed, somewhat to be declined.
Now because the corruption of our nature is such, that we are more prone to
imitate evil then good, to follow David in his sins, rather then in his
tears, to follow Peter in denial of Christ, rather then in his repentance,
therefore to help this, our Savior Christ directs us to the example of holy
Angels which be pure and perfect.

Because these earthly examples be but of men terrestrial, like unto our
selves. But Angels be the most noble spirits of God, the glory and beauty of
all creatures: so that the direction is forcible; If Angels elevated and lifted
up to such a high degree, be always ready and willing to do the will of God,
then much more we that be men much meaner and lower then they be. Saint Paul
tells us, that God when he brings his first begotten Son into the world, he
says, Let all Heb. 1. 6.
the Angels of God worship him: why gives he such a charge unto Angels? was
there any doubt, but that the Angels were ready to stoop and do service to
the Son of God? The answer must be, that it was especially, to raise up men
to do the like: that if the most noble spirits of God, fall and sink down at
the feet of Christ, then much more, we that be but dust and ashes, wormes-meat,
and wretched men, must be still ready to fall before him, and to do him
service. Thus our blessed Savior in this place, shows how prompt and ready
the holy Angels be to do the will of God, and therefore does the more incite
and stir us up to be like them.

That we may make our conversation heavenly, while we be upon earth; That
though our bodies be here upon ground, yet that we might converse above the
Stars, amongst Angels and Archangels, and all the blessed spirits continually
attending to do Gods will. According as Saint Paul speaks, Phil. 3. 20 But
our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for Phil. 3. 20.
a Savior, even the Lord Jesus Christ, etc. And of men thus elevated, he
says, Ephesians. 2. 19. Now therefore we are no more strangers and forraigners,
but Citizens with the Ephesians. 2. 19.
Saints, and of the household of God. Thus, as I say, though we live upon earth,
yet in affection, we must labor to be joined to this heavenly troop of
Caelestiall and blessed Spirits, which attend to do the will of God.

The next thing to be considered, is; How the Angels How the, Angels do Gods
will.
do the will of God? and in what manner: for seeing Christ has set them for
our example, it is good for us to know what altitude and height we must aspire
to, and aim at, though we be not able to reach it. Now there be many ways for
our imitation, wherein Angels perform the will of God.

They do the will of God in purity of affection; not for any by-reasons or
respects, but in sincere obedience only, because it is the will of God; as it
is said by the Prophet David, Psalm. 103. 20. Ye Angels that excel in
strength, that do his commandments in obeying the voice of his word etc. So
must we perform the will of Psalm. 103. 20.
God in purity of affection, because it is the will of God; only desiring to
please him in doing thereof. Thus Saint Paul's exhortation is, Ephesians. 6. 6 That
we do the will of God from the heart. And Psalm. 119 56. says the Psalm. 119.
56.
Prophet, This I had because I kept thy Precepts. So our care must be to do
that which he commands in soundness of heart, without any worldly respects.
Many times, indeed, men do the will of God, but it is not out of any purity of
affection to Gods will, but because it is for their own profit, and brings
them worldly ease, false comfort or some other respects, as Pharaoh, who would
let the people go, not in any obedience unto God, or because God had commanded
it, but in hope of his own ease. The like of Abner, 2 Samuel 3. Who thought to 2 Samuel 3.
establish the Kingdom to David, not in obedience to God, but to maintain his
own greatness and power, and out of private revenge upon others.

Secondly, Angels do the will of God with readiness, never disputing or
reasoning upon the matter, but as soon as they understand it to be the
pleasure of God and his will, by and by, they are ready to perform it. So
Ezekiel. 9 7. As soon as the Angels had their charge, Ezekiel. 9 7. Dan. 8. 16.
by and by they went forth to perform it. And Daniel 8 16. No sooner did the
voice command Gabriel to make the man understand the vision, but he came and
stood near unto him. So must we do, never to dispute or debate the matter,
pretending excuses, but as soon as we know his will, by and by address our
selves to perform it. So did Peter, Luke 5. 5. When he was Luke 5. 5.
commanded to let down his net, and you know the success, they were scarce
able to pull in the net, for the multitude of fishes. So the Governors
servants, John John 2. 7.
2. 7. When Christ bid them fill the pots with water, (which he turned into
wine) never reasoned nor disputed upon it, but did as they were commanded. So
Psalm. 18. 44. It is foretold of that change to be wrought by Christ: As soon
as they hear of me, they shall obey me. Psalm. 18. 44.
Thus must we adresse our selves to do the will of God, with all readiness in
every thing. But if we examine our selves, we shall find such a strange
backewardnesse and reluctation in our hearts; how unwilling be we to come to
this duty, what ado has the Lord with us, as is wonderful, ere we can be
brought to learn this lesson: how often do we fly off and yield to sense and
reason? Well, we must learn to see, dislike and pray against this
untowardness in ourselves and that GOD would give us more true judgment and
understanding, with cheerful willingness to do what he commands us.

Angels do the will of God with delectation; that is, take singular delight
and comfort in doing of it, so must we endeavor to do it with delight and joy;
like as Christ speaks of Himself, John 4. 34. My meat is to do the will of
him that sent me, and finish his work. John 4. 34.
And it must not be grievous in Abraham's sight for the Genesis 21. 12.
Child and the Bondwoman to be turned out of doors. So we must not think it
enough to do good duties, but also look that we have special delight in
doing of them; as David professes, Psalm. 119. 16. I will delight Psalm. 119. 16.
my self in thy statutes, etc. And Psalm. 4. 7. Thou have Psalm. 4. 7.
put gladness in my heart, more then in the time when their corn and their
wine increased. But now this is our sin, that though in many things we are
content to obey God and to do his will, yet we do it with so little delight
or spiritual joy, with such irkesomnesse, tediousness, and unwillingness,
that we endanger all the grace of our well-doing. In this case it fares with
us, as it did with Ezekiel, who says of himself: that he went in the
bitterness and heat of his spirit. So, Ezekiel. 3. 14.
though we are contented to go, that is, to do as God wills, yet it is with
that repining and backewardnesse, that it loses the benefit of the action.

The Angels with earnestness and intentiuenesse do the will of God; they do
not freeze in their business; but bend all their strength about it. So Dan. 9.
21. Dan. 9. 21.
says, The Angel came swiftly flying unto me; so must we do the will of God,
not coldly and idly, but with all our intention and power; yea, this should
also move us, in that this is the commandment of the Lord. Thou shall love the
Lord, with all thy heart, with all thy Deuteronomy. 6.
soul, and with all thy might. Thus much also David confesses, Psalm. 119. 4
Thou have commanded us to keep thy Psalm. 119. 4.
precepts diligently. Many indeed do the will of God in show, but coldly,
loosely, lasily, with dead affections, there is no life in their obedience, nor
spirit in their prayers, how then can they think that God will accept of them.
He that strikes upon a little Violl, and would Sound Violl.
know whether it be sound or not, hearkens to the sound, for if it give but a
dull sound, If the ringing be not shrill, he knows that there is some crack
or flaw in it: So it is with us in our obedience, when we give but a dead
sound, be not shrill, full of spirit and life; and when good duties come but
slack and coldly from us, certainly we have some dangerous crack and flaw
within us, against which we must pray and seek for reformation.

They do the will of God with constancy and continuance; not at one time, and
neglect it at another, but they are always ready and serviceable. So must we
be ready to do at all times, and in all places. As David prays, Psalm. 119.
33. Teach me, O Lord, the way Psalm. 119. 33 Psalm. 44. 18.
of thy statutes, and I shall keep it unto the end. So Psalm. 44 18. the Church
professes, Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined
from thy way. And Luke Luke 1. 75.
1. 75. It is said we should serve him all the days of our life, in holiness
and righteousness. Indeed, for a fit or a spirt we can be content to do so,
hear the word, and frame our selves to some good courses, but to walk on in a
constant course, and do the will of God, as well at one time as another, this
is hard: for commonly men do by their Religion, as great men do by their
Retayners Retayners.
on Feast days, they come up, and are all put in silks and veluets, commanded
to attend: but as soon as the time is past, they are sent to the Country
again, to slouen it as they did before. Even so do we in our courses of
Religion, when a great day comes, a Communion day, or such like; then we get on
all our devotion, we are ready to do some service unto GOD, we seem to
trim up our affections, and to attend with the best as live the life of the
righteous; but as soon as that time is over, by and by we be gone: Lord who
hears of us, till there be the like occasion: This is one of our corruptions
that we must pray against.

Angels do the will of God wholly: in integrity, not in one part and neglect
an other: but do as it is said of the man who had the Inkehorne, Ezekiel. 9. 11.
Lord I have done as thou have commanded me. So must we not make a conscience of
some things, and leave the rest undone, but do all so far as frailty will
permit, For all his ways were before me, (says holy David) and in Is^l. 18.
22.
another place. Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have Psalm. 119. 6.
a regard unto all thy Commandments.

Here we are to take notice of the common course of the world, for there is no
body so vilde and wicked, but is content to do some part of the will of God.
But when it comes to any strait or narrow search, to let all go, and submit
our will to Gods will in all things; Here is that hard trial which makes us
fly off. Pharaoh could be contented to do one part of the will of God, to let
the people go: but to keep back the women and children: at last he would let
all the people go, but not the Cattle: therefore Moses tells him, we will not
leave so much as a hoof behind. The Lord will have all or nothing; so let us
say in our striuings against sin, not a hoof must be left behind, not a
sin, not a corruption, but all must be hated, forsaken, left off, in Gods
service and for Gods sake.



cannot come to perfection of obedience; yet such a resolution must be set up
to do all, being humbled and sorry that we can do no better.

Again, we may, and must do this, to abstain from gross sins which duls
the conscience, and deadens it in time: and then for the other frailties
accompanying our life; We shall find God a merciful Father (upon our
confession) pardoning and passing by all our infirmities: when we endeavor
truly to do his will; as here we pray: Thy will be done in earth even as it
is in Heaven.

4. PETITION. Give us this day our daily Bread.
WHere in before I come to the Petition, I must first speak somewhat of the
order. Having in the three former Petitions, prayed for the glory of God, we
are here taught to pray for our own good, that God would give us all things
needful for this life: by which order of the Petitions, our Savior Christ
would teach us two things.

1 To Order, 2 To moderate our care in the things of this life.
For the first, touching the ordering of our care, for 1 To order ou^ care.
things of this life. Religion does not exclude all care for our selves, but
only to bring it in due order, that we may go the right way to speed. First,
caring for those things which belong unto the Lord, then afterward providing
for such as belong unto our selves. We may seek our daily Bread, but we must
seek it in due order, we may not seek it before Gods glory, Gods Kingdom,
Gods will, but first the one, and then the other. Questionless, the thinking
of our daily Bread, is not unlawful, yea, every thing belonging to this
temporary life, may be looked after: but first Gods glory must weigh down all,
as Christ's Counsel is, Matthew. 6. 33. Matthew 6. 33.
First. seek the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all other things
shall be administered unto you. So Christ says to Martha, Luke 10. 42. One
thing is needful, Luke 10. 42.
God must have the first place. We read that Abraham's servant, when there was
meat set before him, would Abraham's servant.
not eat till he had done his Masters business, which he came for: and when
he had once dispatched that, then the Text says, He did eat and drink. So
must we do in the business we come for, concerning the glory of God, the
Kingdom of God, etc. When we have done that, we may rest with the better
conscience, and look unto our selves for our daily Bread, and ordinary
comforts of this life.

But the world are quite contrary, they begin with the care of themselves,
their own delights, ease, and pleasures: and then if any ouerpius remain, or
have any spare time, they can be content to look out a little for the glory of
God. But you see our Savior Christ would here rectify our thoughts, and
order our care in these things.

2 To moderate our care.
Secondly. To moderate our care; that we do not desire our daily Bread in any
sort rashly, but only with subordination to the best things, so far forth as
may stand with the glory of God, the Kingdom of Christ, and the doing of his
will: and so far forth as these temporary things may be a furtherance and a
help unto those better things. As a man wanting water to Water to a Mill.
drive a Mill, must not too greedily open too many Springs and Sluices, for
fear of glutting and damming it up: So must it be with our wants in this
world; for an ouer-hasty desire and endeavor to satisfy them may quickly
drown up our care for spiritual graces, not caring what becomes of the glory
of God, so we may enjoy our base contentments. Wherefore our Savior shows
that the care of these earthly things, must be with subordination to Gods
glory. Why we pray for daily bread before remission of sins.


Another point to be considered, is, why we first pray for our daily Bread, and
afterward for the pardon of our sins? for in all reason, one should think
that the pardoning of sins, being most necessary should be first, and then
the other? I answer, there are two Reasons of it.

Christ condescended herein to our weakness, and would graciously, first
dispatch us of our worldly care, and fear of wants, that having earthly things
supplied, we might have the more leisure to attend and be better prepared for
the heavenly. Because many times we are so disturbed and incombred about
earthly things, that we have little care for heavenly thoughts, which in that
estate be unwelcome unto us, having but bad entertainment.

As the Woman of Samaria was so troubled about the Fountain water, John 4. 10.
as she could hardly John 4. 10.
hearken to conceive of the water of life which Christ spoke of. And as the
children of Israel hearkened not unto Moses, by reason of the anguish of their
spirits, so it is with us in our troubled thoughts, for the things of this
life. Wherefore our Lord having a regard to this our weakness, would first
rid us of the care of these earthly things, that we might with the more care
and attention, apply our selves to heavenly.

That by experience of the smaller things, we might climb up to the hope of
greater. For at first, men be not easily persuaded of the Remission of sins,
and high Mysteries of eternal happiness, but must be brought to it by steps
and degrees. Therefore our Savior works upon us in this place with a secret
wisdom, that by finding God to be good unto us, in food and raiment, the
things of this life, we might learn to rest and rely upon him for a better
life to come, for it is a sure thing, that he who will not trust unto God for
meat and drink, and such like, will not trust him for the salvation of his
soul, and he that thinks that GOD will stand with him for a piece of Bread,
will never believe that God will give him pardon of his sins, and heavenly
glory; Christ therefore would have us begin at the smaller, that finding the
Lord favorable and friendly in these lesser things, we may be drawn to
conceive, that he will be as graciously inclined in greater matters. As a man
that would try a vessel; first, he puts water into it, and such mean Vessel
tried.
liquor; And then if it hold water well, he is the more bold to trust it with
Wine, or Rosasolis, and the like. So when we find God to be good unto us, in
the meaner things of this life, this makes us the more bold to rely and rest
upon him for greater things belonging to eternal salvation.

Now to come to the Petition it self, therein are diverse particulars to be
considered.

1 What it is that we pray for? (Bread.) 2 Of whom we ask it? (Of God.) Lord
do thou give it, meaning if God do not give it, we shall never have it. 3 By
what right? (Of Free-gift) we do not deserve it, but pray, do thou give it us
good Lord. 4 What quantity of Bread we pray for? (Daily Bread) only so much
as is sufficient to sustain us for a day. 5 Whose Bread we pray for? (Our own)
not bread of others. 6 For whom we ask? (For our selves and others.) 7 For how
long time? (Only for a day.)
(Give us this day our daily Bread.) Concerning the first thing we ask, Bread:
herein we are to consider.

1 The Extent of the Term, 2 The Limitation of it.
First, for the Extension of the Term, by Bread our Bread, he means all
things else, as needful to man's life, as Bread is, so that whatsoever is
comfortable and helpefull to the life of man is here covered under the name of
Bread, as we see, 2 Samuel 9. 7. David said to Mephibosheth, and thou 2 Samuel 9
(...),
shall eat bread continually at my Table; Thereby meaning all things
concurring to the comforts of this life. So Isa. 4. 1. We will eat our own
bread, and wear our own Isa. 4. 1.
garments, etc. That is, live of our own provision, get all things needful
for this life. So that by Bread here (as in many places of Scripture) our
Savior Christ means all manner of comforts of this life. For we know that
many have bread, yet if they have not other good blessings of God, houses and
harbor, fire and water, sleep, health, and rest, they may for all that
perish: therefore when we pray for bread, we pray that the Lord will give us
whatsoever is needful to sustain our weak and frail life in this world.

And for the Limitation, we know that bread is a necessary and a needful
thing. It is not a frivolous thing of superfluity, that we may well want, but a
most necessary thing: wherein our Savior Christ has here so bounded our
desires to guide them to needful things only, Bread, or that which is as
needful as Bread: so that if we once go beyond the compass and reach of
bread, If we desire a thing that is not needful, a superfluous thing to
nourish vanity and pride: then we may not expect that the Lord will give us
that thing which we pray for, because, being not Bread it is out of the
compass of the Lords grant: of which the Lord compla^nes, Psalm. 78. 18. of his
people. And they tempted Psalm. 78. 18.
God in their heart, by requiring meat for their lusts. So Jam. 4. 3. He tells
us why Christians ask and have not: Iam. 4. 3.
Ye ask and have not, because ye ask amiss, to spend upon your lusts, etc so
that our Savior Christ by limiting us to Bread alone, teaches us to ask only
things needful at the hand of God.



Ia^kobs practice and prayer was, Genesis 28. 20. And will give me bread to eat,
and Genesis 28. 20.
clothes to put on; as the Apostle wills us, 1 Timothy 6. 8. When we have food and
raim^^t let us therewith be contented, 2 Timothy 6. 8.
all joining here with Christ's precept for our direction.

Secondly, We ask it of God, Lord do thou give us our Bread, where in we are
to take notice of two things.

1 Of our duty, that we seek for Bread no where, but at the hands of God. 2
Of our weakness and frailty, that have nothing of our selves, but what God
gives us.
Concerning the first, we have many examples in Scripture, to teach us to lift
up our eyes and hearts to heaven in prayer, looking for nothing elsewhere:
that belongs to the comforts of this life. For says David, Psalm. 136. 25. It
is he which gives food to all flesh. So Psalm. 136. 2^. Psalm. 145. 15.
Psalm. 145. 15. The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou give them meat in
due season: Thus all good things are to be sought for from God. What a
wretchedness is then amongst men of this world, and grievous sin, when they
have any sickness lamenesse, strange diseases, or unlooked for accidents, they
do not seek God for their daily Bread, or mitigation of those things by
prayer, or humbling themselves before God: but run to Soreerers, and Witches,
and unlawful means, as though the Devil were more merciful then God, or
Hell more ready to afford them comfort then Heaven: O the end of such is
fearful, as that of Saul, whom the 1 Chronicles. 10. 13.
Lord is said to have killed, because he asked counsel at a familiar spirit.
Some other examples there be to this purpose, but I pass them. But the sum
is; as we must beg all good things from God, so learn we, though the Lord do
not by and by give us, yet to tarry his leisure, and not to repine or murmr
at any thing Moreover, we must always acknowledge, that all the bread we have,
(though our cup do ouerflow) comes from God, we have no bit of bread, not the
least comfort we have, but all comes from him unto us; as David confesses, Ps.
23. 5. Thou do prepare a table before me; and again, He filled the hungry
soul with goodness. Thus as all Rivers come from the Sea, and in all
Countries discharge themselves into the Sea again: So all blessings Rivers Sea
running.
come from God, and must return to him again, with thanks and acknowledgment.

In the next place, we are to take notice of our own weakness and frailty,
that we are not able to supply one bit of bread into our selves, with all our
wit, wisdom, skill and cunning prayers, and labor, unless God do give it.
The Devil persuaded our first Parents, by disobeying the Lord God, that they
should be as gods: but now we may see what goodly gods we are, that we See for
this, August S^rm. 43 D^ plenitudine Dei.
be not able to supply one bit of bread unto our selves, with all our cunning
and skill, unless God give it, and provide it out of the treasury and rich
store* house of his goodness and mercy. All I say is, to set out the state and
condition of the very best of us in this world though we carry our selves never
so high, yet we are not able to put a bit of bread in our mouths, unless God
give it, for every bit we receive is of God, though we impute it to our own
industry and policy.

Why we do pray for Bread, seeing the most of us have bread enough already in
our store, and houses.



1 The substance or quantity of Bread. 2 The virtue and power thereof
Which the Scripture terms the staff of Bread: as Isa. 3. 1. He threatens to
break the staff of bread. Now Isa 3. 1.
though we have the substance, yet if we have not the staff of bread with
the power, we are never the better, for without Gods blessing, there will be no
more feeding and nourishing in it, then of a very stone, yea, as good take a
mouthfull of gravel, as a mouthfull of bread without Gods blessing upon it;
otherwise wrath attends it, as Psalm 136. 15. it is said, so He gave them their
desire, but withal he sent leanness into their souls. And so, though we have
bread yet we must pray GOD to bless it unto us, or else we shall be never the
better for it. This is a point which most of the world know not, they think
that if they have bread in their houses, and tables, all is safe they need not
pray to God for Bread. But if we would consider that all these things come to
nothing, unless the Lord afford a blessing unto it, and breathe upon them with
sweetness from his mouth, this would make us do our duty, and pray heartily
unto God to bless our bread, and to give it.

By what right we demand our bread? we do not challenge it of duty, or
right, but pray that God would give it of his free goodness and grace: so that
herein we profess our own sinfulness and guiltiness to be such, in regard
of sin, that we be not worthy of one drop of drink, or bit of bread, nor can
by any means procure it to our selves. For every day by our sins we forfeit
all we have to God: dispossess our selves of all right and title to that, or
the least and meanest blessing of this life; therefore unless God do give it,
and release us of the forfeit, and admit us into favor, we be but intruders
upon his blessings, which teaches us two things.

Jaakob, Genesis 32. 10. I am Genesis 32. 10. 2 Samuel 7. 8.
not worthy of the least of all thy mercies. So David, 2 Samuel 7. 8. Who am I, O
Lord God, and what is my house, that thou have brought me hitherto: Thus must
we do considering our great unworthiness.



The Papists think they can deserve with their works, and so make themselves
worthy of heavenly glory, God not giving it as a gift, but as their just wages
and hire. But our Savior Christ shows that God does give us our daily Bread
freely; yea, and therefore shows that God does much more freely give us
Heaven: as Romans 6. 23. But the gift of God is eternal life Romans 6. 23.
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Away therefore with the Pride of the Papists
that dare challenge Heaven as a due.

How much Bread we pray for? (Daily Bread) so much only as may be sufficient,
we do not pray for an excessive quantity of bread but we pray to the Lord to
give us so much as is needful, fit to sustain our weak and sinful nature.
The children of Israel desired meat for their lust, not their hunger; and when
they had it, inioyed it not, but the wrath of God came upon them, therefore we
must take notice of this, and learn to moderate our desires, to desire only so
much as is sufficient for use, and no more, as Iaacob does. Genesis 28. 20. If
thou will be with me and keep me in the way that Genesis 28. 20.
I go, and will give me b^^ad to eat and raiment to put on; So Agur, Pro.
30. 8. Remove far from me vanity and lies, give me neither poverty nor
riches: Feed me with food Prou. 30. 8.
convenient for me. Thus there must be a holy moderation of these things.
Chrysostom says well, Ships that be lightly burdened, easily pass through
the Seas, and are many Ships.
times without dangers, but they that be ouer-laden, are ready to sink upon
every storm. So it is when men moderate themselves in the things of this life,
they pass through this life with less danger: are the ^itter and more
contented to go home to their heavenly country. But when ^hey ouerlad the ship
of their bodies, taking in more then they can carry: enjoy more then they can
tell how to dispose of, they are ready to sink, and to cast away all their
precious Merchandise. Therefore let us pray to God to give us suff^cient bread
and no more.

O the corruptions of our life, what excess, is now crept into this world? men
are not content with great matters, but must abound even to exceed others, nay,
we never cease till we have wrested all out of other men's hands, got all the
money out of their purses, all the goods in their houses: but take heed of
this: low Meddowes or Marshes, when they came to be overflowed, Low Meddowes
overflowed.
and the water to stand in them, breed nothing but Frogs and Toades, that
continually creep and annoy them. So it is with our hearts, how soever
otherwise fruitful and capable of some goodness, yet if once they come to be
overflowed with covetous desires, and grow muddy and myery, as standing pooles,
they will breed nothing but frogs and filthy lusts, sins that croke and cry
to annoy and terrify us. Now because by Bread (as you have heard) we
understand all things needful for the sustentation of this life, we must
learn also not only to refrain our diet, but to keep a moderation in all
things appertaining to this life, and hold our selves close to good order and
temperate sobriety that our desires be not like a sea which has no bounds nor
bottom. Esau (though a profane man) could say, I have enough my brother; but
our corruption is otherwise, Esa^.
we cannot be contented with any measure, whatsoever we have is not sufficient:
Nay, though we have enough yet still we desire more and more, we can never be
filled. The Lord complains of this, Isa. 5. 3. Woe Isa. 5. 3. Habak. 2. 5.
be unto them that join house to house, etc. And H^bakk 2. 5. He paints out a
proud man that never keeps at home, who inlargeth his desire as Hell* and is
as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gather^th unto himself all Nations. So
Sa^nt Bazill (...) treating of a covetous man, says, That he never ^easeth day
nor night, nothing satisfi^th him, no boun^ takes hold of all, and turns all
into it se^ ^
small beginnings by l^ttle an^ at length, with force and vi^ their banks, but
bear down whatsoever (...) (...) with* So it is with the covetous men, etc.
But we must learn to repress this affection in ourselves, and pray to God for
an orderly moderation in all things. One says well, That acouetous man is like
a Mole, digging and laboring, when all that he has dug, he gets upon his
shoulders: So Covetous man.
whatsoever such men have got, it lies heavy upon their conscience, puts them
in pain: and becomes a heavy load for them to carry unto the Throne of
Judgment. And as Mice besmeared with Bird-lime, creep up and Mico.
down, gathering a great deal of dust and filth, or other fit matter to
burn: and so lighting on any fit occasion are undone by their own doings, so
it is with a number of men in this world, they scratch and scrape, and when all
is done, it is but sticks and strawes which they gather, to increase the fire
of their own condemnation everlastingly.

There is yet one thing more to be considered in this matter, a point worthy
the noting. That whereas we pray for a quantity of Bread, yet we do not
determine how much. We do not say, Lord give us so much and so much bread, to
teach us all to leave the particulars to the Lord, we pray to be contented
with that which He in his wisdom does determine. A man may indent with a
friend, as the man in the Gospel: Lend me five loaves: but none of us may
indent with Indenting.
God, but refer all to his assignation and appointment. As a man making
challenge to a field, yet is contented to refer the matter to friends, and
stand to their award: so much the rather, if they be just and wise, how much
more ought we to submit all unto God.

Whose bread we pray for? Our own bread, not the bread of others, but we pray
to God to give us our own bread. Now our own bread is that we have faithfully
and honestly labored for in our Calling, well got by lawful means, and no
more. This is that which the Lord promises as a blessing unto his people,
Psalm. 128. 2. That they shall eat the labor of Psalm. 128. 2.
their hands, Thus the Apostle, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 12. Commands 2 Thessalonians. 3. 12.
every one to work with quiernesse, and eat their own bread; so that there
are two kinds of Bread unlawful.

1 The bread of idleness. 2 Bread of the fatherless and wickedness.




The Devil came to Christ in his hunger, and would Matthew. 4.
have had him turn stones into bread, he could not Stones.
prevail with Christ, but he does with many men. Indeed when men get bread by
unlawful means, by lying, cozening, deceit, etc. then they not depending upon
Gods providence in lawful means, do turn stones into bread, and take the
Devils counsel, not being ruled by God as they should. We read Isa. 11. 7. In
that Isa. 11. 7.
great change to be wrought under the Gospel; It is said (amongst other
things) The Lyong shall eat straw like the Ox: Meaning, that then where that
change is truly wrought, they shall be so far from feeding and ravening upon
others (as formerly) that they shall eat straw, be easily pleased: and brought
to a better conformity, being contented with mean, and their own things. So a
man truly converted and brought into the Kingdom of Christ, will rather eat
straw* feed meanly, be contented with what God allows him, then by any
unlawful means come by his food.

Thus you see we pray for our own Bread, that we may provide bread orderly
for ourselves, and not live upon others, or use unlawful means. The Poets
say, that Aelous gave Ulysses all his winds in a box, who Ulysses.
when he was asleep, thought it had been gold, and so opning the box, let out
the winds, which had like to have lost all their lives, and put them in danger of
drowning. So many times it is when men will not be contented with their own;
by doing wicked practices, and performing unlawful actions, they raise up
storms and tempests against themselves, even many times to put their lives in
danger. Therefore let us be contented with our own things.

For whom we do pray? For others as well as ourselves; (Give us our daily
Bread,) which word has a double relation.

1 Respectively to that which went before. 2 To the rest of the members of
Christ's body.
Which is first us that have hallowed thy Name, us that desired thy Kingdom
might come into our hearts; us that had care to do thy will, Lord give us our
daily Bread: So that this Petition is conditional, as if he should say, Lord
if we have done these things, then give us our daily Bread, then feed us, then
Lord give us all things needful for our life. But if we have done nothing for
thee, then we dare not claim that thou should do any thing for us, for
howsoever thou have promised to do us good, yet we must fear thee, and first
Honor thy Name. As Psalm. 34. 9. Fear the Lord, ye his Saints, for Psalm. 34.
9.
noehing wants to them that fear him. So that first we must obey and please
him, ere we may with boldness, use the promises to our comfort: for with what
face can we st^nd up and lay claim to Gods promises, when we have not
performed the conditions, and are not qualified like those parties and persons
the promises were made unto? as Iehu said to Iehoram, when he demanded, Is it
peace Iehu; what peace (said he) so Iehu.
long as the whoredoms of thy mother Iezebell and her witchcrafts are yet in
great number? So may I say, so long as men dishonor God, have no care of his
glory, love of his Kingdom, no desire to do his will, how do they look to
have their daily Bread, their peace, or things needful for this life.

A second relation is, To the rest of the members of Christ's body; and so we
are taught to pray, not Lord give me; but, Lord give us our daily Bread: So
that a Christian man must not regard himself only, but in a fellow-feeling of
other men's miseries, he must pray for their wants as well as his own. The
covetous man he had rather say, Lord give me Bread, then give us Bread: but
the true Christian, extends his care and love unto the whole body of Christ,
whereof he himself is a member. As Abraham sitting in his tent door, in the
Abraham.
cool of the shadow, pittyed them which were traveling in the heat, and was
ready to refresh them: so it is with every true Christian, they are
tenderhearted and have a simpathy with others miseries. So we see in Nature,
when the Sun shines upon these inferior bodies, if solid bodies when they
reflect their beams Sun-shining.
they cast their light and heat upon other bodies that are nearest about them:
but ifthey be empty and hollow bodies, such as have no solidity, they take all
into themselves, and reflect not: So it is in this case, they that be sound
Christians only possessed with power of grace, they cannot hold any goodness
to themselves, but are ready to reflect it, and make others partakers of it: so
must our labor and care be: not be hollow and false, but sincere and true
affecting the good of others, as of ourselves.

how long time we pray for bread: But a day only, (Give us this day our daily
Bread,) of which there be three Reasons.

To teach us to depend upon God from day to day; because we usually rest not in
the present blessings of God upon us, but are ever casting and contributing for
the time to come. Therefore our Savior Christ sets this down to prevent
our carking and caring for the things of this life: for if from day to day the
Lord give us bread, we must be contented, and leave all the provision for
future times unto the Lord, who gave his own people Bread, but for a day
only, Exodus 16. That they might altogether depend upon Gods goodness and
heavenly care from day to day. The little birds (as we all know) when they have
dined, know not where Little birds.
to suppe, and when they are fed one day, they know not where to feed the next,
and yet God prouides for them, and if God remember and favor them, much more
may we rely upon his care and mercy toward us: persuading our selves, that he
who feeds us to day, will feed us to morrow, this week, next week, this
year, next year, and so for ever as we trust in Him.

To teach us to live exceeding carefully, as if our last day were come: for our
life is so uncertain and hangs by such a slender thread, that we know not how
soon it may be broken and gone, and therefore our Savior Christ would have us
live exceeding carefully and watchfully over our selves from day to day even to
our last.

The people of Israel we know do eat the Passover Exodus 12. 11. Passover
eating.
with their loins girded, as men ready to depart at a short warning, so must
we eat our dinners and suppers, as ready to depart and take leave of this world
at all times or whenever the Lord will have us.

That every day we may come to God in prayer: to be not a day from him, for if
we made our suites before men only, we would attend their leisures, much more
must we wait upon God: we may well think when the day is past, our pattent is
expired, and our grant ended, till we have renewed it again, so that every day
(as we have said) we are taught to come to God in prayer, to renew our Patents
and grants of blessings, that God may extend his mercy unto us. For it is the
corruption of the world, yea, of our course nature, that we would not come unto
God once in a month, nay, not in a year, if mere necessity do not drive us.
Therefore our Savior Christ has stinted this Petition to a day only, that
every day we may learn to sue unto God, to have communion with him, in begging
the things of this life: that so we might be led the more happily unto those
eternal better things of life everlasting: and so to be led by the use of
these weak temporary refreshments, to the feeding upon that bread of life,
which the Son of man does give his Saints and servants. So much shall serve
for the fourth Petition: come we now to the fifth.

5. PETITION. And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
Our Savior Christ (as we have seen) in the three first Petitions, teaches
us to beg those things tending unto the glory of God, and the means conducing
unto the same: and in the three last, to beg for our own good things,
tending both to the comfort of this life, and of that to come: as the
forgiveness of sins, a sanctified and a holy life, assisted by the power of
grace.

In the former Petition, we have heard on what conditions and how we ought to
beg for the good things of this life, which as things necessary, tend especially
to the bodily preservation of health and life. Now here in this 5 Petition, we
come to the good of eternal life, and this is either the grace of
Justification in this Petition, or the grace of Sanctification in the next,
which yet is no further good, then as we apprehend and bring home the comfort
of it. The world in their ignorance do usually say, Who will show us any good?
Meaning, a good Lease, Purchase, or bargain, not knowing any good beyond the
good of this life: But there is a further good to be aimed at, for holy David
proceeds and looks up higher, saying. But Lord lift thou up the light of thy
countenance Psalm. 4.
upon us. Lord let me have the feeling of thy favor, and of the forgiveness
of my sins: and grace to live well in thy favor, hating sin, and I shall
joy in it as my chiefest portion. So I say, after the good of this life, our
daily Bread, we are here willed to pray for the good of a better life, pardon
of our sins, and then grace and strength against them.

But before I come to the Petition, two questions must be answered.

1 Why there is but one Petition for earthly things, and two for heavenly, that
is: (daily Bread) and in the other. First, Pardon for sins: Secondly, For
graces against them.

2 Why this Petition is linked to the former, by a coniunctiue practice (Give
us this day our daily Bread) And forgive us our sins. Which close conjunction
we find not amongst the rest.

Because the Lord would not have us too careful for worldly things, but to be
holy and heavenly minded, as much as may be; that we might be discreet in our
demands, and not dwell too long upon earthly things. It is the custom of the
world, (who use to pray) not to care how long they continue their suit for
daily Bread, being pleased to conclude all under that, as Hosh. 7. 14. The Lord
complains, They assemble themselves for Hosn. 7. 14.
their Corn and Wine, the things that they only think on and care for, so as
they could be contented continually to pray for them. Wherein our Savior
Christ perceiving a natural corruption in us, would therefore have us soon to
have done with this thing, and by and by to adresse our selves to better, to
seek more pertinent matters, pardon of sin, salvation of souls; strength,
and means to live holily, without which, all the rest would turn to nothing,
though we had as much as Sea and Land could afford us: so that as Birds which
Birds dipping.
dippe into the Sea to get their food, soar up again and quickly rise, lest
they should dull their wings, and wet their feathers that they cannot fly: So
in our prayers, we must take heed that we do not diue too deep into the
world, bringing our affections so low, as we cannot mount and raise up our
heavy hearts to the contemplation of those heavenly blessings and graces as the
Lord would have us.

Numbers of men though they seem likely in this world, yet are like the Lead
and Plummets of a Clock, Plummets of a Clock.
that continually drive downe-ward, and had need still to be wound up. So it is
with us in praying for spiritual blessings: we decline and draw downe-wards,
so much to the world, as we are heavy and dull in raising up our selves toward
heaven. Let us then recover our selves, and raise up, and wind our hearts up,
and our thoughts as high as heaven, to the love and meditation of heavenly
things.

In a Garden, you see when men have store of heavy Mould mingled.
mould, they mingle it with Chalk and Sand to make it high and lighter: so
when our thoughts be heavy, earthly, and lumpish, our Savior Christ would have
us lift them up with the cogitation and thinking of better things. In the Law,
things that crept upon all four, were forbidden, yet if they had feet to leap
up withal, Creeping things leaping up.
they were judged to be clean. Even so, howsoever some thoughts are about the
things of this world, our Trades and business, yet if we have legs to leap
up with, that we can raise our hearts to God, and better things; when we come
to pray and prostrate our selves before God: it is not to be condemned, they
may pass for clean well enough.

But if they always creep on the ground, if never raised higher then the
earth, if no good thoughts of God, if no looking upward to better things, O
then no doubt they were unclean: not legally unclean as the beasts were but
really unclean in the sight of God and his holy Angels.

To show us, that our care must be twice so much for heavenly things as for
earthly: we must have twice as much care of our souls, as of our bodies:
begging oftener spiritual, then temporal things. In the Law, the weight of the
Sanctuary was double, to the common weight, which was to show that the Lord
Sanctuary weight.
must always have double weight in matters that appertain to the Lord, in the
salvation of our souls: in all such things, double weight, double care, double
endeavor: but how clean contrary is it with the world, who lay all the bent of
their care upon earthly things, and their endeavor for transitory things of
this life; whereas we are taught by our great Teacher, always to ouerweigh our
earthly cares with more heavenly meditations, that thus having quieted our
consciences, we may the more safely go about our worldly affairs.

Again, to the second question, I answer, this is annexed 2 Question answered.
1 Answer.
to the former Petition to show us two things.

First, That pardon of sins in as necessary as our daily Bread: Therefore
with praying for Bread, we are taught also to pray for pardon for our sins
and offenses. So that it is very necessary to have these two joined together,
that whenever we pray to GOD to put meat in our mouths: we always
remember that there is more excellent things to be looked after, then this
temporary food: the pardon of sins, with hope of everlasting life in Heaven.

This is the reason why our blessed Savior so closely joined these together,
that the thought of this temporary Bread might move us to desire the Bread of
Life, for which cause Christ would have these two Petitions connected together.

The Jews (badly enough in other things) say well in this: A woman takes two
children to Nurse, the Child nurse.
one is a very mean one, deformed, crooked, blind, and not likely to live
long; the other as goodly a child as may be, beautiful, well-fauoured, and
likely, infinitely, to out-liue the other. Now the foolish woman, who bestows
all her care, diligence, and attendance upon the worst child, and never looks
unto the best, must needs be ignorant and very foolish in so bad a choice, and
so great a neglect.

So is it with us, we have taken two children to nurse, our Body, and our
Soul, they be the children, and the Soul, we know, is infinitely better then
the Body, more beautiful, and of longer continuance; and yet like the foolish
Nurse, we bestow all our care, labor, and pains about the worst, we are all
for the body, care little for the soul, which yet must live when the body
shall die. But our blessed Savior would have both children looked unto, the
Body respected, the soul remembered, wherefore he strictly connects and ioynes
these two Petitions together.

That though God give us our daily Bread, yet if we have not pardon of our
sins, all the Bread of the world can do us no good. For it is a sweet and
most comfortable thing to the conscience, to be persuaded of Gods favor in the
forgiveness of sins. For if one have all the variety of good things in this
world, though his meat be Manna from heaven, Raiment as precious as Aarons
Robes his life as long as that of Methusalem, his strength as Sampson, Beauty
as Absalon: Glory, Wisdom, and Riches, like Solomon, yet if he have not this
Petition granted him, which Christ here speaks of: The pardon of his sins,
all is lost, all is nothing worth: yea, in terror of conscience, all is
displeasing and uncomfortable.

For says Christ, Matthew. 16. 26. What shall it profit a man to win the whole
world, and lose his soul, or what ransom shall a man give for his soul? This
question Tertullian demands: What will all thy dainty dishes avail Ter^ul.
quid prodest Regium alimentum si ad Gehennam pascat.
thee, if they do but feed thee to the fire of Hell? Therefore remember to
say, Lord give me daily Bread, but O! Give me also pardon of my sins; for
unless I have a feeling sense of thy favor, and hope of heaven, all things
else are nothing unto me. We know that condemned men in the Tower, who have
goodly lodging, lie well, great Tower condemned men.
attendance, yet have poor, or no comfort in all this; when they daily expect
to be brought forth to execution. Even so it is with all the magnificence and
glory of this world, there is no comfort in any part thereof, without the
forgiveness of our sins: one must go to hell. The rich Glutton (we read)
when he was in Hell, howsoever he possessed all things in this life, and was
glorious in estimation and riches, yet afterward they profited him nothing;
nay, they were the greater corrasiue unto him, as he had formerly ioyed and
flowed therein: who found by woeful experience, that one drop of Christ's blood,
one Dram of the forgiveness of sins, had done him more good, then all his
infinite wealth and store of money. Let us then all pray with David, Psalm. 50.
Cast me not away from thy presence, and Psalm. 50.
take not thy holy Spirit from me, give me, with daily Bread, forgiveness of
sins, and howsoever thou deal with me in the things of this world, yet let
me have the comfort of the salvation of my soul.

Hitherto of the entrance into the Petition, and the questions touching the
same; In the Petition it self, three things are to be considered.

1 A Confession. 2 A Request. 3 A Condition.
In the confession three things are to be observed of us.

1 That every sin is a Debt. 2 That we be all fallen into this Debt. 3 That
we be not able to pay this Debt.
For then we would never pray to have this debt forgiven, if we were able to
pay it.

First, concerning the Confession, we acknowledge sin (...) The Confession.
Luke 11. 4.
to be a debt, (for by debts here are meant sins) as Christ in another place
teaches his Disciples, Luke 11. 4. And forgive us our sins. So the debt we
speak of, is the debt of sin: which for two causes is compare^ to a debt.

Because it arises after the manner of a debt; for as a debt (as we know)
arises upon the non-payment of money, and not performance of that which is
due: so because we have not rendered unto the Lord that which is his due, not
paid him that service, love, honor, obedience, etc. that we owe him, being
mightily behind with him; Hence it is, that we come to be mightily indebted
unto the lord, being so far in arrerages unto him, and so sin arises in
the first place, after the manner of a debt.

Secondly, it is compared to a debt because it binds us (...).
to a debt; for as a debt binds us either to payment, or to punishment, to
content the party, or to go^ to prison, so do our sins bind us either to
content the Lord in his Justice, or to undergo eternal damnation so that there
is but one of two ways to escape judgment, either to content divine Justice,
or to undergo punishment. And yet the debt of sin is a worse debt then any
other, for it is not a money matter to be imprisoned for, but this casts him
into Hell, for ever and ever. Indeed the Law has been stricter, for a man
that made not payment of his debt, was to be sold, his wife, his children, and
all he had. Amongst the Parthians the Laws were more cruel, for if thae debt
were not paid, every creditor was to take away so much of his flesh, as the
debt came unto, but these were courses barbarous and cruel. Now by the laws
we see, to be cast in prison is the punishment inflicted for a debt. But for
the debt of sin, we shall not only be cast into prison, which is Hell, but
there suffer pains and torments, easelesse and endless.

Another thing is, that sin is not like a debt we owe in this world, for many
a man, though not able to pay his debt, or not able to pay the interest for the
time, yet may devise some means to avoid and shift it off by a trick,
pretend danger in the way, or conscience in the business, or if all fail he
may die, and then no body can compel him to pay the debt, but no man in the
world can shift off the debt of sin.

Job speaks, Chap. 18. 23. Mine iniquity is sealed up as in a bag.



Psalm. 139. 7. Whither shall I go from thy spirit, or whither shall I fly
from thy Psalm. 139. 7.
presence? If to heaven, thou art there, If to Hell, thou art there also, If I
take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the outermost parts of the Sea,
even there shall thy hand lead me, etc.

Fear him (says our Savior) that when he has killed the body, can cast both
soul and body into hell: so that of all debt, the debt of sin is the most
grievous, wherefore let us be careful above all things to avoid and get out
of this debt. A man that loves quietness and peace, cannot abide to Peace
lover,
run in debt, O how careful will he be to shun it, he will live hardly and
poorly, go thin, and live of his own; so must we do, if we love our own
peace and quiet safety, avoid this grievous debt of sin by all means.
Especially, in age take heed we continue not in this woeful debt. But do as a
man does when he comes into an Inn, calls for no more then he means Inn.
to pay, for though he see a great deal of good cheer before him in the
house, yet he considers what his means and ability is, for otherwise, if he
never think of it, but calls, in for all he sees without thought how to
discharge it, when the reckning comes, and he not able to pay, it is shame unto
him, besides the danger of imprisonment; so fares it with us, it is good to
take up no more then we are able to pay for: but howsoever we see a number of
goodly things in this world, which may allure us, and set our desires on fire,
causing expense of money, let us take heed of being in debt: especially of this
debt of sin, the worst of all other.

That all men run into this debt of sin: yea, and very far, for which we
pray not forgive us our debt, but forgive us our debts, because there are a
great number of them. So that here is a plain confession, that we are all
sinners, and grievous sinners, even the best of us, for this is not a prayer
for some of the worst, but for the holy Apostles, the Disciples of Christ, yea,
for the whole Church dispersed all the world over. So faith, Iam. 3. 2. In many
Iam. 3. 2.
things we sin all: and 1 John 2. 2. Christ is said to be 1 John 2. 2.
the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of
the whole world. And Job confesses, If he would contend with God, he could not
answer him one Job 9. 3.
of a thousand: So David prays, Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O
Lord, for in thy sight shall none Psalm. 143. 2.
that lives be justified. Yea, and Solomon in his prayer, 1 King. 8. 46.
confesses, That there is no man who sins 1 Kings 8. 46.
not: This we see that no man living is exempted from this debt of sin.

I will bear the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against Micah. 7. 9.
him, etc.

Christ Jesus. Therefore let us do for our souls, as Salomons Pro. 6. 1, 5.
counsel is for our estates, If thou be surety for thy neighbor, deliver thy
self as a Roe from the Hunter. So for us, let us never be quiet, for we shall
never prosper (if we belong to God) until we have reconciled our selves unto
God by the mediation of Jesus Christ.

If a man run into arrerages with the King, and every year the Sheriffs and
the Bayliffes come and strain Arrerages to the King.
upon the ground, drive away his Cattle, impound them, disturb his children
and servants, and endanger his person, no man that has any wit in his head,
but will seek to stay the matter, or compound for the debt, that he may live in
peace. Now just this is our case, we all run into arrerages unto the Lord,
and that every month, every year, every week, every day, by one offense or
other. So that in lustice which is ever ready, he may strain and imprison us?
Oh then why do we not seek to stay the matter and to take up the business
with the Lord, to compose and settle it by our heavenly high Priest, Jesus
Christ? and so walk on hereafter in holinsse and newness of l^fe.

That we be not able to pay this debt of our selves: for if we were able to
satisfy it, what needed we to pray to God to forgive it? which prayer, is a
plain confession that we are not able to discharge it: we cannot say with the
servant in the Gospel, Master, appease thine anger, and I will pay thee Matthew.
18. 26.
all. We be not able to pay half, nor whole, nor quarter, nay, not any thing
at all toward the satisfaction of divine Justice: so all our suit is in this
Petition, that the Lord would pardon and forgive it, seeing we are not able to
discharge it our selves. The Papists say, though they cannot pay the whole debt
of sin, yet they can pay a good part of it, and being a little helped by
Christ, they may easily discharge the whole, making up the rest with their own
merits. But if we look a little into the Point, we may easily see that no man
living (save the Lord Jesus) is able to pay this debt of sin: (I prove it
thus) No man can pay God with his Argument against the Papists.
own: But all the good that we have or can do, is the Lords own, and none of
ours but the Lords: therefore no man can pay the Lord with it.

Steward.
The Proposition I prove by comparison: Suppose a Steward owes an hundred pound
unto his Master, and has not a penny of his own; I demand now, whether the
Steward may lawfully pay his own debts with his Masters money? It is out of
question that he cannot. Now this is our case, all we have, is but the Lords
money, nothing of our own, as David confesses, 1 Chronicles. 1 Chronicles. 29. 14.
29. 14. All things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. So the
Apostle, 1 Cor. 4. 7. asks, What have 1 Cor. 4. 7.
thou that thou have not received? and if thou have received it, why boast est
thou, as though thou had not received it? Therefore because all we have is
the Lords, it is evident, that we cannot pay the Lord with it, because no man
can pay a man with his own.

we cannot pay one debt with another, for it is a Rule in Law, that if a man
has two debts due unto him or if you will, owes two debts, by paying of one,
he shall not clear the other: now all that we do or can do, is due debt
unto God, as Christ says, When we have done all we can do, we are but
unprofitable servants. Now because we owe a double debt; first, the debt of
sin, secondly, the debt of death, it is evident by performing the debt of
death, we cannot discharge the debt of sin.

Genesis 23. 16. Abraham paid for his sepulcher, 400 shekels of current money,
amongst Merchants, such as wants nothing of value nor weight. Now God knows
all our service wants weight, when it comes to be waighed, for one cannot pay a
debt with light and cracked Angels, or soothered Gold. Nor can we satisfy the
Lord with our counterfeit works: for when they shall come into the exact
balance of his lustice, they will all like Balteshazar be found light: wanting
of that integrity and worth which God requires: as it is, Isa. 46. 6. All our
righteousness is like filthy cloth, so that it cannot make any current
payment to Gods Justice.

Fourthly, The debt of sin is an infinite debt: the Schoolmen Aquinas 1. 2.
Quaest, on Act. 4. 7. Tant^ grauius Peccatum, quanto est Persona contra quem
Peccatur.
prove this: one says well, So much the greater is the sin, as is the person
against whom it is committed: but the person of God is infinite, so that every
sin committed against God, is infinite, and we are guilty of it. Now we know;
Infinite sins cannot be taken away but by an infinite act; because very
reason will teach us, that the plaster must be of the same extension with the
soar, etc. So he that is guilty of an infinite fault, must have an infinite
act to remove it. No finite power can do this, no sum of money can redeem
it, for then a man might redeem others as well as himself, but as I say, it
must be no finite act, and so, no man living can pay this debt of sin.
Therefore, because no man living can pay it, Hence arises our request that we
pray to God to forgive it of his free goodness and mercy, and so we come to

The second general Head:
Of this Petition, which is the request: Forgive us our Debts, etc. Wherein
three things are to be considered.

1 The matter of the Request. 2 The extension of it. 3 The Time.
the matter of the Request: It is as we see forgiunesse of sins, we pray to
God for mercy, nay, we do more, we do altogether confess that it is the Lords
free goodness to release us from the curse that we have deserved: Here see two
things;

That we have all need of the forgiveness of sins. We have not more need of
our daily Bread, then we need the pardon of our offenses; wherefore, we are
taught every day to seek it here by our Savior: and the Prophet David shows,
the use of Gods mercy unto him should effect so much, a seeking and drawing
near unto God in prayer, upon a sight of our sins; Therefore shall every one
that is Godly, make his prayer unto thee in a time when thou may be found,
etc. So that we have all great need to pray instantly and often for the
forgiveness of our sins, for if the Angels cry, Holy, holy, holy, unto the
Lord, etc. Much more may sinful men who have their consciences laden with
offenses: considering Gods infinite Holiness, and their own vileness, cry
unto God, to pass by so much impurity in them, that sins being forgiven,
they may stand before him on better terms then before. Every man can cafily
find that they have need of daily Bread, but not one of many, that they have
need of Gods merciful forgiveness. If there were an Inquisition made into our
hearts, who examines so narrowly as he should, for offending so great and good
a God? we do indeed customarily say, Lord forgive us our sins, but where is
the feeling, the compunction of spirit, the drawing to particulars, the secret
examination of our sins, the judging of our selves, and such like? we have
peradventure made some search into our consciences, by reason of our sins,
yet we are not wise to know our danger, to humble our souls for our
trangressions, to make up the breach betwixt God and our selves to pray
heartily for the forgiveness of sins, with a feeling conscience and sense of
the excellency of the same.

forgiveness of finnes, this shows, that The forgiveness of sins, is a
most excellent and special mercy that all should seek for. Because we be
sinners, we must therefore be earnest and constant suitors to the throne of
grace, that our sins may be remitted, released and washed away in the blood
of Jesus Christ. This made the Prophet David, cry out again and again for
mercy. And the Prophet Hoshea, in many Psalm. 51.
places, comfort Israel as well as chideth them. And Moses also (after
Israel had sinned) uses this as an especial Argument: Therefore now, if thou
pardon their sin, thy mercy shall appear, etc. But let us come to example.

If a man had committed such an offense that he could Capital offense.
no otherwise escape death but by the Kings Pardon, he neither could nor would
be at rest till by one means or other, he had obtained the same, written and
sealed to; which done, he would carry it home, lock it up safe, and many times
look upon it with joy and comfort. This is the case of every one of us, by
reason of our sins, whereby we have committed flat Treason against the Lord,
thereby deserving ten thousand deaths. Now then, what must we do? but sue for
a pardon, appeal to the throne of Gods mercy, for the getting and obtaining
thereof, be sure that it be sealed and confirmed by the blood of Jesus Christ,
then laying it up sure, that we may often look upon it to our eternal joy and
comfort.

because it is one of the greatest blessings that God gives to any in this
life: as Psalm. 32 1. Blessed is he Psalm. 32. 1.
whose wickedness is forgiven, and whose sin is covered: and Isa 33. vlt,
amongst other privileges, this is reckoned Isa. 33. vlt.
up as a great one. The people that dwell therein shall have their iniquity
forgiven: speaking of the happiness of those that shall be joined to the true
Church. Yea, unless we have this, there is no Beast, Dog, Serpent, Toade, or
any vile Creature, but is infinitely better then we, for when they die, they
go but to the earth, but we (without forgiveness of sins) to hell and
endless pains and torments.

Laban did by Jacob, when he had escaped Laban, Jacob.
him. Laban did pursue and overtake him, searched all his Stuff, when, if he
had found any thing of his own, he would have seized upon him, his goods,
wives, and children, bringing all back again with him. So it is with us,
without a release and protection from the danger of our sins; the devil will
pursue and seize upon us and all we have, look into every corner of our lives,
when if he can find any thing of his own in us, any sin unrepented, then will
he seize upon us, and carry us with him into Hell for ever.



The want of due consideration; because we never look into our hearts lives,
and courses, never think how it stands betwixt God and our souls; for this
cause, we think neither of our debt, nor how to get out of it. The servant in
the Gospel was found infinitely indebted unto his Master, but when did it
appear so, as he was convinced of it? when the debt book was searched into
and particulars ripped open, then, and never till then, was he found to be so
greatly indebted. So it is with us, we think all well enough, till God come to
reckon with us in particular, and set our sins in order before us, as he
speaks, Psalm. 50 and then this monstrous sight drives us to a due
consideration of our woeful and wretched state.

A blind and foolish presumptuous persuasion that God will show us mercy,
though we do not seek it, and though we take little or no pains for it. The
greatest part of the world, as you see, live in their sins without
repentance, never come upon their knees to the throne of grace, to ask pardon
for them, what is the Reason? because (as they say) God is merciful, a good
man, and they may do well enough: all is not so strict as these preachers
would make us believe: but the truth is, If God be merciful, it is to such as
seek it and repent for their sins, as Lam. 3. 25. The Lord is Lam 3. 25.
good to them that trust in him, and to the soul that seeks him. Thus if we
seek for, and prize mercy, we may have it, but if we seek it not; and find
no want of it, nor pray earnestly for it, it is a sure sign we are yet in a
miserable natural estate: that though (...) be an Ocean of Mercy in the Lord,
no one drop shall run unto us; but one day, such shall cry like Dives, for a
drop of such water and shall not have it; nay, if we be cruel to deny mercy
unto others, when we have received mercy our selves, we shall be sure to be
punished for it also.

2 Thing the Extension.
The next thing in this Petition is, the Extension of it, we pray to God to
forgive all our sins, not of any special troubling, weighty, filthy one, but
of a release of all whatsoever. A number of the world, according to the false
manner of their accounts, are only troubl^ for some one sin, that does
distress and lie he^^ily, upon them, having no remembrance of those sins
^^ich never stared them in the face. This was Judas case he was pitiously
perplexed for betraying of Christ but never thought of his covetousness and
corrupted heart, the fountain whence this cursed sin was hatched, and had
root. So do most of us, strive perhaps and pray against some one sin that
troubles us, but we seldom enlarge our hearts to descend down in particulars,
that our secret faults wantonness, lusts, covetousness and the like may be
forgiven: as the holy Prophet by his example, teaches us; Who can understand
his faults, cleanse Psalm 19^
me from my secret sins.

3 The time.
The third thing is. The time of the Request: we see it must be our daily suite
unto God, as every day we pray for daily Bread; so must we pray to God for the
pardon of our sins. This is a special point, that every day we make
atonement and reconciliation with God for our sins, because every day we
renew our sins and offend God, therefore we had need every day to renew our
suits and prayers unto God. When Adam was fallen, the Genesis 3. 8.
Text says, God came to him in the cool of the day; The Lord would not let
him sleep in his sins, but came and awoke him, putting him in remembrance of
his sin. So in the Law; If a man were unclean, yet when Unclean.
the Evening came he must wash his clothes, and so be reconciled accordingly.
Even so, though we be unclean by reason of our sins, yet if we wash our
selves by the true tears of Repentance, we shall be reconciled to God, and
admitted into the Camp again. This then may teach us that howsoever we have
our daily slippes and falls; yet if we do every day labor to make our peace
with God, for the sins of the day, that we do not let them run weekly,
and monthly, and yearly, we may be sure to find mercy at the hands of God.

Now there be diverse Reasons to move us to this duty, and make us renew our
prayers daily without omission.

First, Because we are very prone to forget our sins, nothing sooner.
Therefore it is good to remember them, A Steward.
recknings, yea, every days account cast up: so because we be forgetful, and
a number of sins do easily slip us, we must desire every day to make even
with the Lord. The Apostle counsels us, Ephesians. 4. 26. Let not the Ephesians. 4. 26.
Sun go down upon your wrath. If then the Sun must Sun wrath.
not go down upon our wrath, to admonish us not to be merciless, much more
ought we to take heed of that the Lords wrath go not down upon our sins, for
want of our repentance.

Because the fresher sense of sins is at the first, for by referring
repentance, it takes away the sense of sin, as the memory thereof. Wounds we
know bleed Wounds bleeding.
most when they be fresh, then they do most feelingly affect us: let one have
a bruise or strain, commonly the greatest sense and pain is at the first: but
afterward Bruise, Strain.
time will allay and mitigate, and so slack the sharpness of sense, as we
shall nothing so much feel the grief of them. So it is with our sins, our
greatest and quickest sense of them is at the first; so the sooner we seek for
reconciliation, the more easy will it be for us to obtain mercy, and we will
so much the more eagerly desire it.

Thirdly, Because, if every day we get our sins discharged, (...)
we shall have the less to do when we come to die. Therefore it is good not to
suffer them to run on, but take the^ in pieces betimes when they are committed,
and repent of them. As a man that would carry home a great tree, A Tree.
if he divide it, and break it in a number of small pieces, he may then with
ease at several times carry it away. So if we do with the great bulk and
body of our sins, divide them every day apart, and make our prayers for the
daily remission of them, then shall we have the less to do when we come to
die. Wherefore as sins increase, so let us every day seek reconciliation, that
we bring no after recknings to God: for enough are those every day by
themselves.

Because the sooner we repent of them, the sooner we shall be quiet, and have
peace and rest; for so long as the conscience is awake: and not seared by
sins unrepented of, there will be vexation in the heart, until sins be
confessed and pardoned; as in David's case: He roared, Psalm. 32. 4.
and had no rest until he had made his peace with God. As when an Arm or a
Bone is out of joint, the sooner Arm, Leg.
it is set, the more ease one shall have. So it is with us, whenever we have
sinned against God, the soul being out of joint, the sooner we shall find
ease. Wounds, you Wounds undressed.
know, that are not by and by dressed, will ranckle and fester so, as the cure
of them will be much more difficult and dangerous.

So it is with the wounds of our sins, if they be long kept from searching,
opening and laying them before the Lord. Let us therefore prevent the mischief
which may follow our delays, making upon all occasions a continual and speedy
atonement with God.

The third general part of this Petition, is,

The Condition of the same.
3 Part of the Petition.
We pray to God to forgive us, as we forgive others: yet this cannot be a cause
of Gods forgiveness, but a condition only: It can be no cause, for as the
Schoolmen say, Finiti ad infinitum nulla est propertio: There is no
proportion of the Finite, to the Infinite thing. And so no reason, because we
forgive our Brethren some small matter, that GOD should forgive us the infinite
debt we owe. Therefore, no cause, but a condition of it. Very reason will teach
us this, that it is in the power of the giver to prescribe upon what condition
he gives his gift; as Christ says to Peter, John 13. 8. Unless John 13. 8.
I wash thee, thou shall not be clean: As if he had said, I am content that
thou have part with me in my kingdom and glory, but yet there is a condition
annexed: Except I wash thee, except thou obey me, submit thy self unto me,
thou may not have it. So God did give unto Paul the lives of all that were
with him in the ship, yet it was conditional, Except these abide in Acts 27.
24, 31.
the Ship, ye cannot be safe. And so must we be contented to rest upon the
means which God has appointed: and be willing to perform such conditions as
he inioynes unto us. But the wickedness of the world, and corruption of men:
that willingly will not come to any conditions with GOD, but would have the
blessing without the condition: like the kinsman of Ruth, he would have had
the land, but when he heard the Condition, Ruth.
that he must have Ruth to wife, he refused the bargain. So the Rich man in
the Gospel would have Rich man.
had eternal life, but when he heard the condition, that he must leave all and
follow Christ in a poor estate, he would not meddle with it, but went away
sorrowful. So it is with the world still, and so it is with most men, they
would have the blessing, they would have life everlasting, forgiveness of
sins, and the like, but they will none of the condition, to forgive the
offenses of others. But let us remember, if we look to enjoy the Lords
blessings, we must come to his conditions; we may not have them upon what
terms we will, but be contented to accept of them on what manner the Lord
will give them us.

Now the Conditions, that the Lord gives us, are, (...) Easy.
First; Easy to be done: For the Lord does not say, man must content me for
his sins, let me have so many tears, so much sorrow from thee
proportionable to thy offenses: spend as many days in my service, as thou have
spent in the service of sin. But what says he? Forgive, forgive, be ready
and forgive others, and thou shall ever find me more ready to forgive thee. So
that it is an easy condition which the Lord prescribes. O we might think it
abundantly well with us, if we were able to purchase so excellent a mercy as the
forgiveness of sins, at any rate whatsoever, yea, though we bought it with a
great deal of pains and transitory goods, yea, life it self, but the Lord
lets it come at an easier rate, at such a poor price, that it is wonderful he
imposes no more upon us, then to forgive others? This shows his goodness,
love, and mercy, and all to make us confess the greatness of the same. As
Naamans servant said unto his Master: If the Prophet had commanded thee a 2
Kings 5. 13. Naamans servant.
greater thing, would thou not have done it for thy health? But now, only
to wash and be clean, what a thing is this? So the Lord may say, had he
prescribed us any difficult and hard matter, for the remission of our sins,
would we not have been glad of it? but now when he has imposed so easy a
task upon us, as to forgive others, what shall be said unto us if we neglect
it.

Secondly, A condition profitable to our selves, of no profit to the Lord at
all; what does he gain by our forgiving 2 Profitable to our selves.
of our brethren, but all the profit redounds unto our selves, both because we
shall be the more gentle and fitted unto goodness: and many times by this
means, we shall have the more favor and love by winning many unto us, in love
and kindness: God causing us find from others, as they receive from us: so
gaining some, whom neither sharpness, threatenings, nor sorrows could
reconcile. Look into the Story of the Aramites, 2 Kings 6. 22. When the King
of Israel (having them 2 King. 6. 22.
in his power) would have killed them; No says Elisha, set bread and water
before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their Master, by which
occasion, the bands of the Aramites, (it is said) came no more into the land of
Israel to annoy it. So great profit came by this kindness and goodness: so
will it turn altogether to our profit and benefit, if we can practice this
duty in forgiving of others.

Thirdly, It is a condition which does much further and help us in the
expectation and hope of blessings looked for, 3 Helpefull.
For if we who be but men, that have but a drop of mercy, can forgive our
Brethren, we may well think, that the Lord who is the Ocean and full Sea of
graces, must and will be more ready to forgive us. When we see the Sun shine
upon a wall, we easily conceive that it Sun shining on a wall.
shines more brightly and gloriously within his own Orb. So we finding so
much more mercy in our selves, to forgive our Brethren, may easily conceive
that there is much more mercy in the Lord to forgive us, because he is the very
Fountain of all that mercy and forgiveness we show to others.

Thus as the blessing is conditional, so must we perform the condition: if
we hope for Gods favor.

Why of all other duties does the Lord prescribe this condition unto us.

Roots.
which though many times they be divided and parted, yet by and by, they do
shut so close, that no body can see the seame where the rent was, or the
division. So among Christians, howsoever it cannot be but in this frailty of
life, contentions and iarres will fall out amongst us, yet must we shut again
so close, yea claspe one another so fast, as no body may perceive who has
offended.

Now in the Condition it self we may consider two things.

1 The Duty, which is, To forgive our debtors. 2 The Quality, we must forgive
them as God forgiues us.
1 The duty.
By Debtors, first, are meant, such as have sinned and offended against us, for
by debtors, our Savior Christ does not mean such as owe us a money debt; for
a man may crave forgiveness of God, and yet require a money debt of his
brother. Indeed, in case of miserable extremity, when a man is insufficient and
cast behind hand by inevitable means, then a man is bound to forgive a money
debt: for the Prophet Isa. 58. 3. amongst Isa. 58. 3.
other sins vpbraides the people with this as a maine great one: Ye will
require all your labors as debts: But out of this case of extremity, with a
safe conscience we may ask a money debt. For so when one of the Prophets, lost
his Axe; he cried out, it was but borrowed, 2 King, 6. 5.
inferring that it must be restored: and Elisha, increased the woman's oil to
pay debts with. And the Apostle bids us owe nothing to any man but love: to
which I may add, that by Solomon it is made a note of the wicked to borrow and
not to pay again. So that it is clear by debtors, our Savior Christ means
such as are indebted to us in the debt of sin, whom we must forgive, as the
Lord forgiues us. As the Apostle exhorts, Coloss. chap. 3. verse. 11, 12. Put on
tender mercy, kindness, etc. forbearing one another, and forgiving one Colos.
3. 11, 12.
another, as GOD forgave us, which is the second thing.

2 The quality of the duty.
Next, The quality of this duty, we must forgive others as God forgiues us.

(God forgiues us truly.) He does not make a show of forgiveness, and keep
our sins by him, to watch us a good turn, but truly, according to his love
and mercy: forgiving and forgetting our sins, so must we forgive our
brethren, and not make a show of forgiveness, keeping rancor and malice in our
hearts, like Cain, who spoke kindly to his brother, but when he had Genesis 4.
him in the field, fell upon him and killed him, Matthew. Matthew. 18. 33.
18. 33. Except ye forgive from your hearts, your brother; (says our Savior)
you shall not be forgiven. So when we say, I will forgive and do not, let us
consider, would we have the Lord to deal so with us? consider, what a woeful
case is this: for who can answer one of a thousand? and who cannot but be
terrified to think that God remembers all.

Secondly, God forgiues us easily without any great ado. 2 2 Samuel 12. 13.
No sooner did David say, I have sinned, but Nathan told him: The Lord has
also put away thy sin, thou shall not die. No sooner was he humbled at his
Masters feet, who owed the 1000 Talents, but the King released him, and so must
we forgive our brethren, not stiffely, standing upon our terms, but being
gentle, and easily entreated, as we find the Lord is unto us. But I appeal to
common experience, how hardly we are drawn to this duty? there must be such
entreaty, mediation, such going between parties as is wonderful, and all
far from the pattern here propounded unto us.

Luke Luke 17. 4.
17. 4. If seven times a day he turns unto thee, and say it repents me,
thou shall forgive him. If this move not, yet let us remember the many heinous
sins, which God forgiues us, and so be moved to forgive others.

God forgiues us often, not once, but many times, though we sin from day to
day, to morrow, and next day, yea, to our lives end. So must we often and upon
all occasions forgive one another. If thy brother offend daily, thou art bound
daily to forgive him; not once or twice, but even to seventy times seven times.

Thus if we follow the example of Christ, questionless there will be a great
deal of more love wrought in us, we shall have an assurance of Gods mercy
toward us: prepare a way into our selves, by preparing our hearts to perform
these things: that with comfort we may pray in all occasions: And forgive us
our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. Now follows the sixth and last
Petition.

6. PETITION. And lead us not into tentation, but deliver us from evil.
AFter prayer for our daily bread, we have been taught, to pray for the
forgiveness of our sins, which was to show that without the pardon of our
sins (through Gods favor and mercy) all the bread in the world is nothing
worth. It is nothing to have all the blessings of Sea and Land, there with to
perish in sin, and at last be damned with the devil, therefore after prayer
for our daily Bread, we are taught to seek for pardon for our sins,
reconciliation with God.

Now in this sixth Petition, we are taught to go one step further, and pray to
GOD for the grace of Sanctification, that we may not only (...) our sins
pardoned, but our spirits also awakened and strengthaned to recover life, work
vivification, having power and virtue wrought to resist them, so as we may no
more fall into sin, but that we may be kept by the power of God in all holy
courses. This is that we pray for in this Petition, that as God has freed us
from our sins, so we may be freed from sin hereafter; In sum, That we may
not be led into tentation. But whereas there may seem a connection of two
Petitions in one, it may teach us two things.

First, That upon pardon of former sins, the Devil is always ready to
fasten new sins upon us. Therefore after pardon of our sins, we pray that
we may be kept from more sins, as knowing the Devil will be busy, not
only, not to let us alone so, but seeks by all means to supplant and surprise
us, as the Apostle speaks, 2 Cor. 11. 3. But I fear, lest as the Serpent
beguiled Eve, through his subtilty, so your minds might be corrupted, etc. and
1 Pet. 5. 8. Be sober (says he) and watch, for your adversary the Devil as a
roaring Lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour. So that howeuer we may
rely upon the pardon of our former sins, the Devil is ready still to thrust
new sins upon us. As we know if a prisoner get out of prison, and make an
Prisoner escaped.
escape, the Iaylor will not let him go so, but make Hue and cry after him,
raise the Country, lay all the Towns and ways to take him, till at last be
seize upon him, and bring him back to the stinking Dungeon which he came from.
So does the Devil deal by us, when we have made an escape, got out of the
prisonhouse of our own sins, he will not let us go so, but makes after us,
lays all baytes and ginnes possible, to see if possibly he can entrap us, that
so he may carry us back to our former old courses to walk in the ways of
darkness. So we see the grieuousnesse of sins, and daily tentations, are
inseparable companions in this life: for we shall never have our sins
forgiven, but the Devil will be ready to tempt us unto other sins, so to
lay a new load upon us.

That to the grace of Justification, we must always labor to join
Sanctification, that is, we must not only labor to have our sins pardoned,
but also mortified, and the power thereof weakened, for by sin there be two
things always remaining.

1. The guilt of sin. 2. The corruption of it.
The guilt of sin, is a binding of us to the punishment (as I have said) by
order of divine Justice, which is taken away by the Lords merciful
forgiveness, but when the guilt is taken away, the corruption of sin
remains, which is a way ward disposition of the soul, whereby it is wholly
inclined unto evil, and unfit and unable for heavenly things. Now this is that
we pray for, that God would not only take the guilt of sin away, with the
punishment and penalty due unto it; but the corruption of it also; this is our
desire: others indeed are well enough content to have their sins pardoned,
but to have them mortified, restrained, weakened, and the power thereof abated
and quite killed, but a few desire heartily. But we who know the danger and
bitterness of sin, must pray also to have the soul Sanctified, the
faculties rectified, and set in the same beauty, that the LORD in the beginning
gave it. When a man has broken an Arm or a Leg, some fools care Arm or
Leg broken.
no more but to be eased again, so the Surgeon can give them somewhat to
take away the ache, they go no further: but they who be wise do not only
seek to have the pain slaked, but also to have the bone well set again, that
by that means there be no blemish or disproportion to the rest of the body. So
it is with a true Christian, he does not only desire to be rid of the pain of
his sin, the aches of his soul, but the very corruption of it also healed
and mortified in him. David conioynes these two together, Psalm. 103. 2, 3.
Bless the Psalm. 103. 2, 3.
Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who forgiueth all thine
iniquity, and heals all thy diseases. The like we have, Psalm. 51. 9, 10.
where he prays, Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities,
create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit in me. Thus after
Justification, he prays for sanctification, which also must be our care
through the course of our life. So much of the connection.

The Petition it self has two Branches in it.

1 We pray that we may not be tempted unto sins 2 That though we be tempted,
yet we may not yield unto it.
Now there be two kinds of Temptations obserueable, which we are subject to in
the course of our lives.

1 Of trials and tentations to sin. 2 Of sickness and diseases.
Tentation, is any present provocation, or inclination to sin, which is a
bait laid by the Devil, or our own flesh against us. When we pray therefore,
not to be led into tentation, we pray that we may not have any provocation or
inticement to sin, that may overcome or entrap us, in leading us from that
love, duty, and obedience we owe unto the Lord: so that the words in this first
part of the Petition, contain two principal things.

1 A Confession. 2 A Request.
Here is a close confession that our sins deserve it, that the Lord may
justly leave us unto the will and power of temptatation. As it is said of the
Gentiles, Romans 1. 24. Wherefore Romans 1. 24.
also God gave them up to their hearts lusts, to do things unseemly. So 2
These. 2. 11. It is said, because they went on 2 These. 2. 11.
in the love of darkness, and received not the love of the truth, that they
might be saved; for this cause GOD should send them strong delusion, that they
should believe a lie. So that God in his just judgment gives us up to our
sins, making one sin the punishment of another. This the Lord shows
plainly in the parable of the Vineyard, Esaias 5. 6. For so also a man that has
Vineyard.
a Vineyard, as long as it bears well, he will fence it, weed it, and hedge
it, that no hurt come unto it, but if it grow barren, and yield him no profit,
then he causes the hedge to be thrown down, pull away the wall, and let in
Hogs, Swine, and Vermin to devour it. So does God order and deal in the
business of our souls, so long as we bring forth branches flourishing and
worthy the fruit of the Gospel, so long we are fenced and tended well cared
for of God. But when we grow barren, bring forth briars and weeds, then all
our labor is lost: when although the Lord does not let in hogs and swine,
yet does the Devil and all the power of darkness, come in upon it: and
blindes and hardens us more and more; by reason that we have abused the gifts
and graces which the Lord first bestowed upon us.

That we are exceeding prone to yield unto temptation: Wherefore we
acknowledge that the Lord in Justice may give us up to the temptations of the
Devil, for which cause we pray that we might not be tempted, because we find
such infirmity in our selves that if we be tempted, (a thousand to one) we
shall yield to the tentation: for the corruption of man is like unto dry
Tinder, ready to kindle and Dry Tinder.
take fire with every little spark. So ready are we to be carried away with
every little temptation; wherefore our Savior Christ wills his disciples to
pray, That they enter not into tentation, as knowing how feeble Matthew. 26. 41.
and weak they were to resist it. Men know not themselves, if they do not
know this, how ready and prove they be to lay hold on every tentation, so that
it is good for every man to be jealous of himself. If one had a body Body of
Gunpowder.
all of Gunpowder, how careful would he be not to come near the fire, afraid
of every little spark; even so, knowing our own procliuity to sin, how
ready every spark (that is, every temptation) is to take hold upon us, we
ought to be the more careful, by all means to fly away from the occasions of
it. O how ready are we to brag and vaunt of our strength, that all the Devils
in Hell shall not be able to corrupt us: and thus many times associate our
selves with Drunkards, Swearers and unclean persons. Little do these men know
themselves and their own corruption, that they be so apt to take fire, and
ready to yield to temptation. And albeit they escape away with life as Jacob
did, yet many times they go away halting, and carry a wound and scarre with
them to their dying day. As let a man stick a Candle to a stone wall, though
the Candle do not burn Candle on a wall.
through it, yet it will leave a shrewd smutch behind it, soyling the wall, so
as it will not easily be wyped out. Thus it is with tentations, though they do
not all the mischief they would and might do, they will yet be sure to leave
an impression of filth and stains behind them.

The Request, that seeing we are so prone to yield unto tentation, we pray that
God would not leave us unto our selves, or give us over to them, but that we
may be kept by his power and mercy, not only from sin, but from all the
occasions of it: which shows, if we would keep our selves from sin, we must
shun the temptation, baits and prouocations thereunto, or else not avoiding
the occasion, we shall never avoid the sin it self, considering the
procliuity of our nature unto it. Can a man (says Solomon) take fire in his
bosom, and not be burnt? go upon coals and not singe his feet, entertain
many sins, and not be faulty? It is impossible. Peter (as we know) was as
bold, and (in show) as well settled as any man; but when he came unto the high
Priests Hall, and was thrust in amongst that wicked crew, he thought it was
good policy to say as they said, do as they did, and so most shamefully denied
his Master, but on the other side, good Joseph (as we read) was not only
careful to avoid the sin, but the occasion of it, when he was enticed by
his lewd Mistress: he hearkened not unto her to lie with her, he durst not tarry
in her company. So that herein consists the wisdom of a Christian, to avoid
all the occasions and prouocations unto sin. When the Lord determined to
cause Flood ceasing.
the flood of waters to cease from off the face of the earth: It is said he
stopped the fountains of the deep, and shut the windows of heaven. So
because there be certain floods of sin in us, we must stop the fountains
below, and the windows above: all occasions and prouocations leading unto it,
that we may avoid the torrent and ouer-flowing thereof. Chrysistome says
well, It is an easier matter to avoid the occasion, then when the occasion is
offered, to avoid the sin. An easier thing for a bird to fly by a snare,
then when she is entangled with it, to escape out of the danger, and avoid it.
Thus must the wisdom of the Lord, teach us wisdom to avoid the occasion, as
the sin it self.

But from hence arises a great question, Iam. 1. 13.
Lord be said to lead us into temptation, seeing Saint James says, That God
tempts no man to sin.

It is one thing to lead a man into tentation, and another thing to tempt. To
lead a man into temptation, is, to permit a man to be tempted, to give way to
the Tempter, and this God does in Justice. For Saint Paul says, God gave the
Gentiles up to their own lusts: and by the Apostle it is said, He sent upon
others strong delusions: yet does not God tempt a man to sin, but the devil
only, and his own concupiscence, but God (in his Justice) first gives way to
the temptation, as is plain by that place, 2 King. 22. 20. Where God is
brought in, 2 King. 22. 20.
asking this question: Who shall entice Ahab to go down to battle, and fall
at Ramoth Gilead? and so upon the offer of an evil spirit, to perform this
office: God says, Go, thou shall entice him, and shall also prevail. So that
though God tempt no man to sin, yet no man is tempted, but the Lord is the
chief orderer and guider of the temptation. As when a man sets a Dog upon a
Bear. Dog, Bear.
It is the Dog that flies upon the Bear, and lugges him and pulls him: but it
is the man that sets the Dog upon him, and guides, and ouer-rules him in all
that he does. So is it in temptations, it is the Devil and our own flesh
which tempts us to sin but it is God in his Justice, that directs,
ouer-rules, suffers the temptation to ebb and flow, go on and off, at his
own will and good pleasure, of which there be two Uses.

Pilate, thought to strike fear into Christ with this; Know thou not John
19. 10.
that I have power to crucify thee: and have power to loose thee? O but much
more ought this to strike terror upon us, that the Lord who is Omnipotent,
has power to free us from tentation: and when he pleases, also, to set all the
world against us, upon us, to torment us.

Job. Otherwise he has malice and power enough to ouerturne and destroy us all
suddenly. To this purpose, Saint Paul sweetly speaks, 1 Cor. 10. 13. That God
will not suffer us to be tempted above that we be able, etc.

2 Branch of the Petition.
The second Branch of this Petition is, (But deliver us from evil.) Whereby is
meant the evil of sin, not any bodily evil, of wounds, troubles, diseases,
and the like, but the evil of sin whereby God is provoked and offended:
being so called, evil, (...), etc. by an excellency or excess, because of all
evils, it is the greatest evil in this world, to have an evil conscience, to
be of a lewd life, a swearer, drunkard, unclean person, etc. This is the
greatest evil, above poverty, sickness, blindness, lamenesse, or any worldly
loss whatsoever: though most of the world do not think so. Demand of them what
is the greatest evil in the world? some will say, a wicked wife, some the
loss of dearest friends, some want of health, money, and the like, some one
thing, and some another, as their ignorance and fancy leads them, but the
truth is, we see the greatest evil is the evil of sin: Which I thus prove.

Argument.
That must needs be the greatest evil which separateth us from the greatest
good. God is the greatest good: and sin separateth a man from God; Ierem.
Therefore sin must needs be the greatest evil of all others.
For neither poverty, sickness, blindness, lamenesse, nor any affliction (of
it self) separates from God: nay, they being sanctified, draw us nearer to
God, to know him better, and trust more in him; as Zeph. 3. 12. I will Zeph. 3.
12.
also leave in the midst of thee, an afflicted and poor people, and they shall
trust in me. Therefore of all evils the evil of sin is the greatest: seeing it
depriues us of the greatest good of all the sweet and comfortable communion
with God, his Angels, and all the joys of Heaven, and brings to communion with
the devil and his angels, to Hell torments for ever. We see how Mary wept and
took on when Christ was removed from her sight, Oh Mary weeping.
(says she) They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid
him: So is every true Christian discouraged, having lost sense of communion
with Christ: when he apprehends ho^ his sins have raised up a partition
wall betwixt God and him, this of all sorrows is the greatest: Nay, in this
case, nothing can comfort until the Sun shine: Again, until the Son of
Righteousness discover himself some way to the soul, by some beams of his
favor: as the Churches experience was in that doleful estate, Lam. 1. 16.
Lament. 1. 16.
For these things I weep, mine eye, mine eye runs down with water, because
the Comforter that should relieve my soul, is far from me, etc. So is it
with every sinnesicke soul, until they have found and recovered Gods favor
lost.

the bottom. The people, 1 Samuel 14. saw honey drop, 1 Samuel 14.
and yet (though they were extreme hungry) no body durst taste it: because of
the curse, so howsoever we see the honey of this world drops, pleasures of
sin, yet it is not best to taste them, because of the curse and bitter Honey
dropping. Porters.
fruit of sin. When Porters are hired to carry a load, they use first to
feel and poise it with their hands, to see if they be able to undergo it, for
if it be too heavy, they will not meddle with it. So should we do before we
meddle with sin, consider the burden and weight of it, weigh the danger and
punishment, that so finding it of all evils the greatest, we may fly and
shun it.

To be contented then to endure patiently the evil of punishment, that we may
escape the evil of sin; seeing GOD of his infinite wisdom inflicts the one
that we may be freed from the other: as one well says: A wise workman, will
undergo the lesser evil to avoid Lesser evil. Surgeon.
the greater: as the Surgeon cuts off one member, lest all the body should
be infected: or as in a fire men will pull down three or four houses to save
a whole Town. So it must be our wisdom, by enduring the lesser, to avoid the
greater evil of sin; for the evil of Punishment, is not absolutely and
simply evil, (evil in it self) it indeed seems evil to him that feels it:
but it is good in it self, as Iraeneus speaks, It is Iraen. lib. 4. cap. 72
and Chrysostom. Hom. Ad Populum. Aethiop.
good in it self as being an act of Divine Justice. Malum Paeuae: evil in the
punishment, Sed bonum est Justitia Dei. good in regard of Gods Justice. But the
evil of sin, it is absolutely and simply evil in it self: because it is a
direct auersion and turning away from him that is only good.

The second thing remarkable in this last Branch of the Petition, is, to
observe two or three things from hence, that we desire to be delivered from
evil.

First, Our own inability, that we be not able to deliver our selves. It is
God that must deliver and keep us from all sin. So that in confession of our
own frailty and weakness, we acknowledge all power to be of God which must
deliver us from evil: yea, from this great evil of sin. So Peter shows, That
we are kept from the 1 Pet. 1. 5.
power of God, through faith unto salvation. And Christ John 17. 15.
prays for his disciples, That the Lord would keep them from evil. So that
it is God only who keeps us from evil we are not able to keep our selves from
the very least.

Schoolmen, go on very smoothly, some worse and more harshly.

Augustine against the Pelagians, shows by many strong reasons; but also very
reason will confirm it. For,

No body can deny but that it is a good thing to resist any tentation
whatsoever.

But there is no good thing in us by Nature.

Therefore by Nature we cannot resist any tentation.

That there is no good thing in us by Nature; see for proof, 2 Cor. 3. 5.
Where the Apostle shows, we are 2 Cor. 3. 5.
not of our selves sufficient to think a good thought. And Christ tells us,
John 15 5. Without me ye can do nothing: John 15. 5.
Wherefore we must desire still that God would deliver us by his Almighty
power. A little child, so long as he is led by the hand of the Mother, so long
is he Child led.
able to walk up and down the house without hurt, but if the Mother once let
it go, then it falls, and breaks face or nose, and so cries out So it is with
the children of God in this world, so long as he vpholds and sustains them by
his grace, so long do they walk without hurt and danger in the ways of God.
But let him never so little withdraw himself and his Grace, leave us to our
selves, by and by we fall into great and grievous sins, whereof happily we
are not healed many a year after. You see what David's confession is; I said in
my prosperity I shall never be moved: But thou hidst thy face, and I was
troubled.

Secondly, This shows it to be a great deliverance and work of Gods
goodness and mercy to be kept from sin. It seemed a great deliverance, the
escaping of bodily danger^ as Peter from prison, Joseph out of bondage, Daniel
from the Lions den: but indeed the great deliverance is to be freed from
sin, which the Angel pronounces as a great blessing (speaking of the birth
of Christ) His name shall be called Jesus, for he shall Matthew. 1. 21.
save his people from their sins. So Psalm. 116. 8. He confesses this for a
great mercy. For thou have delivered my Psalm, 116. 8.
soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. This the
people of God must especially pray for to be freed from the power of sin. But
oh! the greatest part of this world have no care to be delivered from this
greatest evil; So they may be delivered from trouble, danger, sickness, they
think all is well with them, they are content to live and dye so, yea to rot
in their sins. As the children of Israel cried unto Moses, Toll Serpents,
went to have the fiery Serpents removed, Fiery Serpents.
being well enough pleased to retain their sins, so they were rid of the
Serpents. So do the men of this world desire to be rid of the Serpents,
worldly griefs and wants, annoyances, sickness, lamenesse, unseasonable
weather, and such like, but no care to be rid of the greatest evil of sin.

3 Thing.
What be the evils of sin, which we here pray to be delivered from?

I answer in general, we pray to be delivered from all sin, so it comes in
unrestrained: Lord deliver us from evil: that is, from all evil. So that we
pray to be delivered from every evil way, as David, Psalm. 119. 101. I Tsal.
119. 101.
have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy
commandments, So the Apostles exhortation 2 Cor. 7. 1.
is, Let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
perfecting sanctification in the fear of the Lord. It is the common corruption
of the world, that they be careful to avoid some sins, and not others. Like
Iehoram, who took away the Images of Baal, and yet departed Images Baal.
not from the sins of Jeroboam. So it is with many of us, we can be contented
to take away the Images of Baal, to be afraid of some gross and grievous
sins, such as Murder, Theft, high Treason, etc. and yet they will continue
in a number of other sins unrepented of. But we must fly from all sin, as
much as may be. If a Thief have found one hole in a house, at that A thief.
one hole, he may carry out all the wealth and treasure of that house. So if
the Devil find but one hole in our hearts, one close sin we are addicted
to, at that one hole he will rob us, and carry out all our treasure, leave us
never a good grace to stand by us at the day of death;

Thus much in general.

In particular.
particularly to be delivered from three wicked evils; From the evil of a
wicked heart, because it is the fountain that all our actions come from; for
which cause the Apostles exhortation is, Hebr. 3. 12. Brethren take heed, left
there be in any of Heb. 3. 12.
you an evil heart, to depart away from the living God. And the wise man's
counsel is, Prou. 4 23. Keep thy heart Prou. 4. 23.
with all diligence, for from thence comes life. If a man would have good
water about his house, he must especially look unto the cleansing of his
Springs, for though he cleanse his Pipes and Conduites, yet if his Springs be
foul and muddy, he is never the better. So because the heart is the Fountain
and Spring of all evil, we must especially look to that.

offensive evils, scandalous to our holy profession, such as do not only
bring disgrace upon our selves, but in some sort also cast disgrace upon the
Lord himself. Which is contrary to that rule of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 10. 32.
Give no offense neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles, 1 Cor. 10. 32.
nor to the Church of God: even as I please all men in all things, etc. So Paul
says, 2 Cor. 9. 15. For it were better 2 Cor. 9. 15.
for me to dye, then that any man should make my rejoicing vain; So it should
be with us, rather to die a thousand deaths, then to loose our rejoicing, bring
any dishonor unto God, or stain our holy profession, and the Gospel.

Thirdly, We pray against the evil of our own Nature, that is, against those
sins we are most prone, and inclined to, for every one has some special
sin which haunts his nature above the rest. Now therefore we pray unto God
that he would deliver and keep us from the special sins which our nature is
prone and inclined unto: As the Drunkard from his own drunkenness, the Liar
from his deceit, the corrupt man from his uncleanness, etc. David he prays
(to this purpose) to be delivered from his iniquity. It cannot be somewhat
easy to keep us from our own sins, such as our nature is most inclined
unto, herein a man may make truest trial of himself. And as this must be the
continual care of a Christian, so especially now when the blessings of God lie
before us, and we be ready to gather that which the good hand of GOD has
provided for us, O then pray unto God that we be kept from evil, from the
evil of sin that he do not take away his blessings, or hide his countenance
from us: as Moses was desired to cover the shining brightness of his face. But
entreat we the Lord to come into his Vineyard, to enter upon his blessings,
and to enjoy the fruit of our labors: and so to guide us continually by the
hand of his good providence: As we may not be led unto tentation, but be
delivered from evil. And that for these reasons.

1 For thine is the Kingdom, 2 The Power 3 And the glory for ever. Amen.
Having thus spoken of the Petitions, both which concern Gods glory, and our
own good: whereby Christ has taught us to make our Requests regular,
whatsoever we ask, demanding it according to Gods 1 John 5. 4.
will, with assurance to receive it: as we have it, 1 John 5. 4. He now at last
brings us unto a view of those reasons, whereby we may strengthen and back our
Petitions, that we may be assured not to loose what we pray for. Seed as we
know may perish two ways.

1 If it be not good. 2 If the ground be naught.
For though the seed be good: yet if the ground be not answerable, it will
come to nothing. But it is not so with the seed of Prayer, for the ground that
it is sowed in, is the ears and bosom of God. Therefore howsoever it may
perish in respect the seed is not good, yet it can never miscarry, because the
ground is good, but the LORD will make it prosper and return it with a
blessing and increase.

Therefore let us hold our selves to the rule of Christ, and then we need not
to doubt, but to have a blessing if we seek for it; and be not wanting to our
selves, the Lord will not be wanting unto us, as you have heard.

Now for the conclusion, it contains two things.

1 Certain reasons to enforce the Petitions, Thine is the Kingdom, Power, and
Glory. 2 A reflection or reiterating of our desires, in the last words, A men,
which is as much as to say, Lord, let it be so.
our Savior Christ annexeth these, and does propound Petitions without
enforcing reasons? This was to show with what earnestness, and excellent
fervent intention, we must pray to God, not slightly and coldly, but pressing
him with arguments, being serious to obtain what we pray for. But how do many
of us pray, indeed it is with such deadness, and coldness, as if we did not
greatly care whether our requests be granted or not. Now to correct and mend
this fault, our Savior shows we must be serious and earnest in our suits.
David says, My voice came to God when I cried, My voice came to God, and he
heard me. Children be earnest when they crave, but Children crying.
when they cry, they are so importunate, that they will have no nay. So we that
be the children of God, must not only crave of God, but cry also, and be so
importunate, that nothing can quiet us till we have our requests granted, and
the blessing we seek for. This our Savior shows by the importunity of a
friend, suing at midnight, (an vnseasonabletime) who beats, and knockes, and
calls, and will not rest until he have the three loaves that he came for. As
also by the widows importunity Luke 18. 5, 6,
and prevailing with the unjust judge: which shows, that the greater and more
it is, the more acceptable our Prayers are, and the likelier to speed.

Saint Paul wills us to strive by prayers with God: meaning, that as Jacob
strove, wept, and wrastled with Genesis 32. 25.
the Angel, and would not let him go without a blessing; So should we strive
with God by prayer, in a holy reverence, and say as he said, Lord I will not
let thee go Hosh. 12. 4.
unless thoublesse me, unless thou show mercy upon me, and grant me my
desire; and then, no doubt, keeping the right course which Christ has set
down, we shall prevail with our God. But oh! how are we to seek in this,
how poorly come we forward in grace, as having no life in us? as though we
suspected that God were not able to grant our requests? or else the immoderate
cares of this world choke up our desires: or the foolish interposition of
vain thoughts, and want on motionshinder our zeal and devotion. So that by
our Saviors reasons, we must learn to quicken our selves, to be more serious
in our prayers, considering God will have it so, and delights in importunity,
therefore showing us undeniable reasons to incite us to pray.

Secondly, we must consider, What kind of reasons they 2 What kind of reasons
they be.
be which Christ annexeth here? They be all reasons taken from without us, and
not one of them found within us: which was to show, that nothing of the world
is within us, (no not in the very best of us) that might move or incline the
Lord to show mercy and favor unto us: no such dignity or merit, whereby we may
procure favor or think to be heard and speed at the hands of God: seeing
whatsoever inclines God to hear and pity us, is wholly in himself. As David
shows in that Psalm. 44. 4.
prayer of the Church, Psalm. 44. 4. Thou art my King, oh God, command
deliverances for Jacob; through thee will we push down our enemies, through thy
Name will we tread them under that rise up against us. So Psalm. 143. 11. He
Psalm. 143. 11.
begges quickening from God for his Names sake, etc. And Daniel 9. 18. (says
he) We do not present our supplications Dan. 9. 18.
before thee for our own righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.

So he himself by the Prophet speaks in another place: I do not these
things unto you for your sakes, O house Isa. 48. 11.
of Israel! but for my holy Names sake, etc. Thus when we would obtain any
good thing from the Lord, we must learn to go out of our selves, and to raise
all the matter of our hope and speeding from the Lord, for his own sake, out of
his mere goodness and mercy.

3 The reasons are forcible.
Thirdly, we are hence to consider with our selves, that the reasons be fit and
forcible, whereby our Savior Christ, secretly answers three doubts concerning
prayer, which might be discouraging impediments, to hinder us not to speed,
when we pray.

when the party to whom we pray, has no authority to grant it. This was seen
when the Mother of Zebedees sons came unto Christ, desiring a request of him,
that her two sons might sit, the one at his right hand, the other at his left
hand, in his Kingdom, unto which Christ's answer was; first, in generaall, Ye
know not what ye ask, etc. and then he tells her, But to sit on my right hand
and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to Matthew. 20. 20.
them, for whom it is prepared of my Father. Here she petitioned amiss, in
such sort as came merely from affection and favor to her children, this is
one impediment, suing unto one who has no authority to grant, at least in that
thing.

when though the party has authority, yet he has not power and ability to
do it. As in that desolation of Judea, prophesied of, Isa. 3. 7. Where some
should come Isa. 3. 7.
and hang upon helpless helpers: this answer (he shows) they make. In that
day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer, for in my house is
neither bread nor clothing, make me not a ruler of the people. So Mat. 17. 16.
We read a complaint made unto Christ by a certain man whose son being
lunaticke and brought to his Disciples, they could not cure: this is also a
discouragement, if we doubt of the parties ability to help.

both authority and ability: yet is unwilling to grant, as we see in churlish
Naball toward David, Shall I then 1 Samuel 25. 11.
take my bread and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers,
and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be? these be the three
impediments which if they possess one thoroughly with a prejudice, may hinder
prayer: either not to be, or if done, yet not to speed Now, our Savior Christ
remoueth all these, showing; 1 That the Lord has authority to do it, because
the Kingdom is his.

2 The Lord has ability, because his is the power.

3 Has willingness to do it, because all the glory and honor of it shall be
his own.

And thus by these three reasons, our Savior has cleared and removed all
these rubbes in the way, which might make us doubt not to obtain at the hands
of God what we pray for.

reason, taken from Gods authority, (For thine is the Kingdom) we observe, The
Sovereignty and free disposition of all things is in the hands of God: So as we
may well pray, Lord thou may give us Heaven, pardon of sins, daily bread,
all that we need and pray for, Because, Thine is the Kingdom: thou have the
free and entire Dominion of all things, and thou (as Sovereign Lord) may
dispose of them, and dispense them at thine own will. So David says, Thine, O
Lord, is greatness, and power, and victory and praise: for all that is in
heaven, or in earth, is thine: both riches and honor come of thee and thou
raignest over all, etc. All other things are tied to laws and rules; a man in
his family may not take the childrens bread and give it unto the dogs. Yea, a
King that will rule in his own Kingdom, has his power limited and confined
of God; for it is mentioned as a note of an evil King, 1 Samuel 8. 14. That he
shall 1 Samuel 8. 14.
take their fields and vineyards, and best O live trees, and give them to his
servants; But God has an illimited power and unrestrained, so as he may
dispose of all things at his pleasure: being therefore sure that we can ask
for nothing which he has not authority to give us.

the Kingdom is thine. So, O Lord! it belongs unto thee, and is much for thy
honor, to give us all these blessings and graces that we pray daily for. For
we all know that it belongs unto a king to provide for the comfortable and good
estate of his own subjects and servants. And therefore Salomons kingdom and
government (amongst other things) was so renowned for this, because he so
royally and richly Salomons provision.
provided for his subjects, that silver was nothing worth in his days. So
seeing God is our King, it belongs to his care, to furnish and store us with
all graces needful. Thus holy David's practice was to fetch all his wants out
of Gods storehouse, as Psalm. 5. 2. Hearken unto the Psalm. 5. 2.
voice af my cry, my King, and my God, for unto thee will I pray. The reason of
this his dependence upon God, he shows, Psalm. 74. 12. For God is my King of
old, working Psalm. 74. 12.
salvation in the midst of the earth. Thus also it is Gods honor to furnish
his own subjects and servants, with all manner of blessings and graces
necessary. The uses briefly are two.

He has the free and absolute disposing of all, to distribute, and give away
at his pleasure, unto whom he will, and when he will. Therefore yet a while,
pray still, be patient, and wait his leisure, for he will come to thy comfort
in the best time.

It is not lawful for me to do with my Matthew. 20. 15.
own as I list: So let us be contented with his good will and pleasure, he
who has least has more then he deserves: see what Jacob says, Genesis 32 10
Genesis 32. 10.
I am not worthy of the least of thy mercies. So when old Eli was threatened
with the destruction of his house, for the transgressions of his sons: his
reply is. It is the 1 Samuel 3. 18.
Lord, let him do what seems him good. And David Psalm. Tsal. 39. 9.
39 9. says, I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, because thou did it.

The power of GOD; that is, the strength and ability to do all whatsoever we
pray for or need, is Gods. Earthly Kings many times want power, though they be
willing to help their subjects and servants; as when the poor woman cried out
to the King of Israel (in a great distress of hunger) Help my Lord, O King!
He answered: Seeing the Lord does not succor thee, how should I help thee?
Thus we many times want power, but there is no want of Power and ability with
God, seeing out of the rich storehouse of his abundant plenty, he is able to
supply what we stand in need of: As the Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 5. 20. Unto
Ephesians. 5. 20.
him therefore that is able to do exceeding abundantly, above all that we either
are able to ask or think, be all glory for ever. Thus it is a good thing for
every man to be persuaded of this, that we can ask nothing at the hands of
God, but he can give it. Whereupon the Leper, and Matthew. 8. 8.
so the Centurion, both come to Christ with this speech, Lord if thou will,
thou can make me clean. And 2 Cor. 9 2 Cor. 9. 8.
8. He shows this much, That God is able to make all grace abound in them,
etc. Peter (we read) so long as he carried his eye to Christ, he was able to
walk upon the waves of the Sea. But when he looked away from Christ, and cast
his eyes upon the Winds and Billows, by and Peter's Seawalking.
by he began to sink. So is it with us in this world, as long as we can cast
our care upon the power of God, so long we may be vpheld in all temptations and
troubles: as a man standing on the top of a high Tower, is safe so A man on a
Tower.
long as he looks up, but looking downwards, is ready to fall. So it is with
us, when we do not look unto Heaven, but look on fears and other things
downe-wards, we by and by are in danger of drowning. It is a good thing
therefore ever to look unto the power of God, considering that what is
impossible to man, is possible with God, with whom all things are possible.

For thine is the glory for ever and ever. That is to say, Lord it is thy glory
and honor to do these things that we pray for, and though not for our sakes,
yet Lord do it for thine own honor and names sake, which is above all things
a strong motive, there being nothing which more mooues, and preuailes with him,
then his own glory. The glory of God, is as it were the eye of God, his
tenderest part, yea, such a part, as he will not have touched: as I saiah
speaks thereof. My glory will I not give to another, (says the Lord.) So
though nothing in the world be in us, and we have no merit, being to fall into
the dust, yet this is sure that the Lord will think upon us, as David speaks,
Psalm. 40. 17. But I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinks on me, etc. he
will think on Psalm. 40. 17.
whatsoever concerns his own glory and honor: Consider we then what a great
mercy this is unto us, that the Lord has lapt and folded up our good in his
glory. As the Iuie is so wrapped about a tree, I hat it cannot be fel'd, but we
must fell the tree also: so is the glory of God infolded Iuy.
and wrapped in our good, that they both go together.

These things confidered, let us strive in our prayers, with humbleness,
confession, shame, importunity, giving all to God, and emptying our selves of
all good things in our selves. So Abraham speaks unto God, Genesis 18.
I have presumed, that am but dust and ashes to speak unto the Lord. So he
says, Isa. 40. 17. All Nations before Isa. 40. 17.
him are as nothing, and they are counted to him less then nothing, and vanity.

Thus must we come down all and be abashed in our own sight, referring our
selves in prayer to the good will of God, using strong Arguments, and much
Patience in Humility.

Amen.
This last word contains a refiection or inference of our desires. Some
learned men take it for an assent of faith, but though in Positions and
Propositions, it beso, yet in prayer it is always used as a root of
reflection, Amen, Good Lord let it be so. Which shows that there must be great
attention in our Prayers, the mind must be seriously fixed upon that we speak
for to the Lord, without straying and wandering thoughts. It is an opinion of
the Papists, that if a man have a general intent to pray, it is no sin to
entertain wandering cogitations, so that a man may go on with his beads, and
finish up the number of his dotish sayings for all his business. As they that
have a journey to London, if they put Journey to London.
themselves on the way, need never think on London, for every step the horse
takes, sets him forwards. But our Savior Christ here shows the flat contrary,
that we must finish up our prayers, with the same attention, earnestness, and
feruency, with which they were begun, all wandering thoughts being expelled. For
so long and no longer we pray, then our mind is elevated and lifted up unto
the Lord.

Saint Augustine says well to this purpose; who intends to speak to one in a
serious matter, and then turns his talk to another? who will have a suit to a
Judge, begin to propose the matter, and then turn his speech to his friend
standing by? who can suffer this? Speech turning.
who can endure it? much more then when we come to GOD in prayer, ought we to
have our thoughts set, and minds prepared to be attentive unto that which is
said: like Holy David: to be able to say, My heart is fixed, O LORD, My heart
is fixed: awake my glory, etc. that we may not appear before the Lord: with
flat, dead, heavy spirits, and wandering thoughts: but with ravished hearts and
minds serious, thirsty, earnest, attentive, longing for the things prayed for;
We may always conclude our prayers comfortably, to our everlasting rejoicing,
to cry, Even so Lord; Amen, Amen, Amen.

To the Reader.
CHristian Reader, I send thee here the sour and bitter Pill of Repentance,
yet fear it not, for it comes not to kill, but to cure thee. It may be bitter
in the taste; but take my word for it, it will be healthful in digestion I
know thou can endure to sweat, purge, and toil for the health of thy mortal
body; why will thou not do as much for the everlasting good of thy immortal
soul? If thou be an Atheist, I leave thee in thy gall of bitterness unto
thy perdition (except thou Repent:) but if a Christian, I pray thee remember,
what the Spirit of God says. Every one that has this Hope in him, purges
himself even as he is pure. Are all things become new by Christ? and do thou
think to go to Heaven in the old rotten defiled rags of the first Adam?
there being no change wrought in thee? Deceive not thy self, there is no
remedy; if thou will not mourn for sin, thou shall mourn for judgment. If
thou will not shed tears here for thy offenses, there is no remedy, thou must
of necessity weep for ever in Hell, where shall be (says our Savior)
wailing and gnashing of teeth world without end. Be not therefore (like
Ephraim) a deceitful Merchant: weigh thins rightly in the balance of the
Sanctuary: and remember (as God wishes of his people Israel) that thy chiefest
wisdom is to remember these things: The misery of sin; The Happiness of
Holiness, and thy later end: which if thou neglectest, all thy other actions
are and shall prove but mere foolishness in the sight of God. Vanquished by
the importunity of a friend (in hope it might prove profitable for thy good)
I gave way to the Printing of this small Treat^^e: though (in regard of my own
weakness) I did not hope to live so long as to reuiew and publish it my self.
Pardon therefore I increate thee the wants and failings thereof. Feed on the
honey: supply the rest with thine own mounting more ample Meditations: and
with the help of others of this nature, use it by Gods blessing as a poor
help to lift thee up one step higher upon Jacobs ladder (which is the end I
aimed at) until some other of more learning, piety, experience and wisdom
erect for thy sake a more excellent fabric upon this weak foundation, which
he heartily wishes:

Thy servant in Christ Jesus, JOHN SMITH.

To the Christian Reader.
GEntle Reader, I offer here unto thy view a Treatise of Repentance, which I
found in the study of the most worthy Author a little after his death: written
in an extraordinary small rugged blotted coppie: which since that time with
exceeding care and pains, was thus fitted for the public good; hoping that
thou will take it in good part as it is, though the exact curious hand of the
Author was not to perfect it, as he intended, if he had lived a little longer.
I know the diverse Books already extant upon this subject, might have
discouraged me so, as to have spared my pains herein: but that as diverse
meats diversely cooked and dressed, fit best diversity of Pala^es and queasie
stomachs: So I hoped that perhaps the plain and unusual handling of this
Treatise, might comfort, encourage, and stir up some one or other, supplying
from the storehouse and fountain of the ever abounding Spirit, somewhat not
observed, or at least not thus cooked by any other. For which cause, and that
the memory and pains of so learned, holy, and Judicious a man of God, should
not be altogether buried and forgot, it has been thus by Gods assistance
published, Let me therefore entreat thy charitable Censure of what is done
for Gods glory and thy good, for which, I promise some other way to strive how
I may best show my self,

Thine in the best bonds, (...). HEART,

A TREATISE OF Repentance.
GALATH. 3. 19. 24. Wherefore then serves the Law? It was added because of
transgressions, till the seed should come, to whom the Promise was made, and it
was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator.

Wherefore the Law was our Schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we
might be Justified by faith.


TO apply Christ unto us who is the means of Salvation given of God, there
must be two works;

1. A work of the Law. 2. A work of the Gospel.
That the Law may effectually work upon us, and bring us unto that for which
it was appointed of God, there must be

1. A knowledge of the Law. 2. An application of the Law.
Of the knowledge of the Law we have already spoken, now are we to entreat;
How every man may apply it to himself, and so thereby both measure his own
courses, and curb his wicked life. For even as the man Elisha, ^lishes
2. King. 4. 34. applied his body unto the childs body, 2. King. 4. 34.
his eyes unto his eyes; his hands unto the childs hands; and his mouth unto
the childs mouth, etc. and then it appeared what difference there was betwixt
the childs cold body, which began to receive life from Elishaes warm body: So
when a man shall apply the law of God unto himself unto his heart, he shall
soon perceive what a damnable estate he is in, and how far short he comes
of the means to avoid death and damnation. So then, the best course for every
man is, to apply the Law of God unto himself, and measure his own actions by
it; for a man may have a great deal of knowledge of the Law of God, and yet be
never the better for it, if he be not wise to apply the knowledge unto
himself, and examine his own courses and life by it, for this will discover
unto him all his spots and blemishes: and leave no corner of the soul
vnransacked. Even as a workman coming to hewgh a a piece of timber, he takes
a line or a thread, and applies Piece of Timber.
it unto it, by and by he sees where it is marked or chalked, or crooked, or
strait, and so proceeds in his work accordingly: So let a man apply the
strait threeds and lines of the law of God unto himself, and by and by he
sees his own evil ways: where he performed too few duties, where he
prosecuted too much his own will, and how there remains unto him a reward,
according to his evil or good actions. So then every Christian who takes care
to apply Christ unto himself, must not only know the Law of God, but know how
to apply the same unto his own soul and conscience: that the Law may
affright, wound, and bring him under, both to a sense of sins present venom
and bitterness, as also to an unfeigned and sound total hatred thereof for the
time to come. Now of the Law thus applied, there is a double use;

1. In the man Unregenerate. 2. In the man Regenerate.
In the the Unregenerate man, there is a fourefold use thereof.

It shows him Generally what is sin? for a man by his own light of his eyes
and reason, is not able to discover his disease unto himself, Romans 3. 20. For
by the Law comes the knowledge of Sin: and Chap. 7. 7. Nay, I knew not
sin but by the Law. So then, the law of God discouers and displayes sin
unto us. O, we cannot see with the light of our own eyes and understanding,
if God help us not to see. We are not by nature inspired to know good and
bad. No, until the law of God discover unto us what sin is, it is impossible
for us to discern our misery. As a man that is brought into a dark room
cannot A dark Room.
tell how it stands, whether moated, or toward a yard or Orchard, nor how it
is adorned, and made handsome and fine, or otherwise lies sluttish and beastly,
but bring a candle into the room, or tarry till the Sun rises, and by and
by every thing is apparent: So let a man look upon the light of his own
reason or understanding, and he will quickly fall into every ditch, and run
headlong into the by-ways of frailty, corruption and wickedness. But let God
light up the candle of his law, and by and by we shall see what is good, what
is not good: what is lawful, and what is unlawful for us. This is the first
use of the Law in the man unregenerate; it shows him generally what sin is,
that it is a sin to lie, to swear, to make our table-talke of filthy
actions, to be disobedient to superiors, and that we must be disrobed of our
own filthy estate. The Law of God I say, can discover us, whether we offend
in thoughts, words, or actions, and make it easily known what sin and
corruption dwells in us. As the Lepers Lepers, 2 King. 7. 9.
said unto themselves, 2. King. 7. 9. We do not well, this day is a day of
good tidings; Let us rise, etc. So the Law of God can make a man say unto
himself: I do not well to lie, to swear, to dice, to mispend the Sabbath: to
riot in evil company, to be impatient, proud, covetous, a backbiter, etc. O
let me rise and get me away speedily from this miserable condition lest evil
befall me.

To show him the Fearfulness of sin, what a grievous and fearful thing
sin is: how dangerous for a simple man to offend so great a God, to incur
the indignation of so high a Majesty. A woman hops she is with child, when
she feels many stitches, longings, and other distemperatures Woman pained.
of her body, but when her greatness and swelling womb appears, then is she
assured, and not only finds it so, but ere her deliverance feels diverse
violent pangs and grievous convulsions: So when men run on in sin, the Law of
God at length makes their wickedness apparent, not without perturbations,
anguish and sorrow, till there be a deliverance from the same, and the
heinousness of their transgressions; Again, as a man having a foul bedurted,
or bespotted face, does neither know the same, Dirtie face.
nor seek to wash or make it clean, till some friend bring him a glass, or
he himself look in one of purpose, then is his ouglinesse quickly discovered,
and he is ashamed of his former deformity; so fares it with a man in sin,
he knows nothing, nor feels his own wretchedness, till the law of God
acquaint him with his misery, and show him the ougly and bespotted face of his
transgressions: yea, to be loathsome and abominable, foul as any vile Lepers
under the Law. Yea, the law of God pleades as it were in Gods behalf: and
says, as in Isay 7. 13. Is it a Isa. 7. 13.
small thing for you to grieve me, but you will also grieve my God? This is the
second use of the Law, not only to show us what sin is but also to discover
the greatness and heinousness of the sin: and what a fearful estate we
remain in under the same, with the vengeance and punishments that must and
will ensue upon it, if we continue in the fear full estate thus presented
before us.

It shows in particular one to be a sinner; a great and grievous sinner in
the sight of God, so that the law of God does not only show a man generally
what is sin, or how grievous and contagious a thing sin is, but it also
shows a man that he himself is a sinner, a great and manifest offender
against the Majesty of a great God, so that a man must not be contented with
the first or second duty, but come particularly unto himself, or else the Law
will follow him at the heels with Tues homo, and make him ashamed of his
wickedness, or unwillingness to be discovered. It will do as Nathan did to
David, at first he began with Parables, Nathan.
and laid open not only a sin, but the heinousness of the sin: but at
last he came nearer, and in plain terms said, Tues home, So does the Law of
God deal with all sinners, and never leaves them till they apply it
particularly to themselves, and be able or willing to say as David says, Psalm.
51. 3. Against thee, against thee holy have Psalm. 51. 3.
I sinned; and done this eiull in thy sight, etc.

That it shows a man what a Piteous estate he is in by reason of his sin,
and that he is a grievous tranfgressour in the sight of God, for the Law
pleades and shows Gods cause, that he is present at all times, in all places,
and has no respect of persons; but reprooues all, showing, that we are subject
to vengeance, but by the means of Christ, so that the Law of God works these
effects in a man.

The fear of Damnation, many a man can in a bravery scorn death, and set
little by any torture, but at last he bursts out with an old saying in a
Father: Non mori sed Damnari metuo, I am not afraid to die, but I am afraid
to be damned; I am not afraid of the pains of death, but I am afraid of the
pains of Hell.

Shame in a man: for continuing in filthiness, by committing such sins,
whereby he knows he has offended God, as Romans 6. 21. the Apostle asks, What
fruit Romans 6. 21.
had you then of those things where of you are now ashamed, etc. so that the
Law of God will bring great shame upon us for our sins, it will make a man
loathe to be known, and afraid to look up to heaven as the Publican, Luke
18. Luke 18. 13.
13. But the Publican standing a far off, would not so much as lift up his
eyes to heaven to pray: So the Law will shame us and make us afraid of God,
and of our selves.

Thirdly, Grief and sorrow for the loss of God by reason of our sins: yea,
the fear of this loss makes us cry out as it is, Lament. 5. 16. The Crown of
our head is fallen, woe unto us that we have sinned; Oh how many passages are
Lam. 5. 16.
there in the Psalms, of grief, vexation of mind, and trouble of Conscience,
yea, shedding of reares and such like, for the sinning against God, and this
not only in the person of David, but in the behalf of the Church of God, and
to show every Christian, what a dangerous estate he is in, that continues in
his wickedness against God, and offends him by his sin.

Fourthly, Desire of Reconciliation, for as Micah, Judge. Micah.
17. 2. could not be quiet though he had the money, and brought it; as long as
he thought his mothers curse lay heavy upon him, but sought by all means to be
reconciled, so fares it with a man under sin, after the Law has told him
what curse and vengeance he is subject unto; O how can he be quiet or at
peace, though he bring all the sacrifices in the world, if he be not
reconciled to God and his Word. If the Law of God has once wrought upon a man,
that he may see in what a desperate estate he stands, then of all other
things in the world, he most desires to be reconciled to Christ.

Thus the Law makes a man fit to receive Christ, that before knew not what it
meant, for by showing a man his sin, the greatness and grieuousnesse of the
same, by making a man accuse himself, and confess in what an estate he is
in: as far as damnation, fear to lose God, shame to be in so desperate an
estate, and a longing after the quietness of his soul, and purchasing the
peace of conscience: considering the Law cries our upon him with a loud voice,
how he has incurred the wrath of God: then has he no other refuge, but to
fly unto Christ, and by his means to desire reconciliation with God, which
must needs be so, after the sight of his sin: and this is the use of the Law
for the unregenerate man.

Now in a Regenerate man there are three uses of the Law, in Application
thereof. To keep down his Pride, that he may not swell, not be any wise
puffed up with his special graces and gifts. So St. Paul confesses, 2. Cor. 12.
7. And lost I should be exalted out of measure, 2. Cor. 12. 7.
there was given unto me a prick in the flesh, etc. for though we be in the
state of Grace, and may presume of many comforts and privileges belonging to
our election, yet lest we be puffed up and over presumptuous with opinion of
the state we are in, the Law can keep us down, and make us look upon the
black feet of our frailty and corruption, as if we were still under the
curse of God. It is read of the Peacocke, that in the midst of her pride and
Peacocke.
spreading of her glorious tail, all is suddenly abated upon the casting her
eyes upon her black feet: So loc the proudest boaster of his own
righteousness, or the privileges of a Christian, look down upon his sins
which the Law may show him, and he will quickly hang down the head and be
dejected in countenance.

To keep him fast unto Christ, as the only means of his salvation; for the
Law does not only show us that we be servants of sin, and ^oes unto
Christ, but even then when we are in the state of Grace and subject to many
temptations, that yet we are in a fearful plight; yea, the Law shows us
plainly, that we are under sin, and so sinners, and subject to the
condemnation of sin, then is there no other refuge, but to fly unto Christ,
and keep fast unto his Promises and Passion, Merits and Redemption, that so
the soul may still from his high perfections fetch matter of supply
continually unto her own imperfections.

To be a mark unto us for a godly life, for Directions to live according to
the will of God: as the Prophet Isaiah in many places shows: and David, Psalm,
119. Lex tua lucerna Pedibus: Thy Law is Psalm. 119.
a lantern to my feet, etc. as if we were to be lighted and directed in our
way, finish them as they were a burden unto us, and only a type of Christ, but
where the Law ties us to a holiness and strictness of life, where it shows
us what sin is, and the deformity of the same; or what is pertinent to
salvation, we are bound to observe and make it a pattern for our lives, so
then the Law not only drives us to see our sins, but to acknowledge them, as
1. John 1. 9. If we acknowledge 1. John 1. 19.
our sins, he is just and faithful to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us
from all iniquity. There is then a necessity of leading a holy life, for all
such as look for that blessedness to come; this lesson the Law must teach,
and direct us and guide us in the way; For as a man who has a long journey to
go, and only has a general knowledge of the place where he must rest and
abide, had need of particular directions to bring him thither, with Man in a
journey.
more safety and less peril and danger: So fares it with us in this world,
we can all say, we must go to heaven, but cannot lead a holy life which
must bring us thither, nor know wherein it consists, unless the Law teach us,
and show the way to practice those excellent rules demonstrated for the rule
and square of our life. Lo then you have seen of what an excellent use the
Law is, both to the man Regenerate and Unregenerate: The next thing must be to
show you the use of the Gospel.

LECT. II.
THE USE OF THE Gospel.
ROMANS 1. 16. For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power
of God unto salvation, to every one that believes, to the Jew first, and also
to the Greek.
WE remembered you the last day, that to apply Christ unto us there must be
two works; First a work of the Law, secondly a work of the Gospel, a work
of the Law to humble us, and a work of the Gospel to comfort us, and to raise
us up. Now because these two works depend one upon another, this is the order
that the work of the Law must always go before the work of the Gospel:
First, a man must be humbled by the Law, before he be fit to be comforted by
the Gospel, and so whosoever thou be, never look to find any true work of
the Gospel, till thou have first felt the true work of the Law, till thou
have been humbled for thy sins, and searched thy own estate by the bright
shining lamp of the Law of God, never look that the Gospel will bring peace
unto thee until then, Christ himself says, Luk 4. 18. that he was sent, For
to Luke 4. 18.
preach the Gospel to the poor, that he should heal the brokenhearted,
that he should Preach deliuerauce to the Gaptiues, etc. So that you see the
Gospel must be published to the poor, to the brokenhearted, for till a man
be poor in spirit, brokenhearted for his sins, Christ is not sent to
proclaim comfort unto him. Quodante sententiam datam non licet appellare, a
man may not appeal before sentence be given, or that a man be condemned in
open Court, so there is no appealing unto the court of the Gospel until he
be condemned in the Court of the ^aw: thus the work of the law still goes
before the work of the Gospel. As we see in nature that a man must beesicke,
before he be healed, so before a man Sick man.
has Christ to heal him, he must be sick, yea deadly sick of sin, yea, of
his own sin, and then Christ will come and put his body upon his, and apply
some plaster of his blood for curing of him. And so whatsoever thou be, never
look for a work of the Gospel, till first thou have felt the work of the
Law. If a man have a corrupt and Cortupt sore.
dangerous sore in his flesh, if he would be cured, or prevent the mischief
of a gangrene, he must prepare himself to endure both trouble, pains, and
many other inconveniences, he must first endure the lancing of it, then the
cutting and squising out the filthy matter and corruption; then diverse
corrasiues to cut out the Vl^er; and lastly, if need be, searing and
cauterising before the healing plasters be applied; Even so must a man do in
the healing of his sins; First, before he obtain a pardon, or be comforted
with the hope of Redemption, the Law must take him in hand, search his frailty
and corruption, lance his sins, squise out the corruption of nature, make him
roar and cry again and again with the smart of his wounds: and the gentle
Cataplasmes of the Gospel, may be applied, and the comforts of remission
ministered unto him from the Physician and Surgion of our souls Christ Jesus,
and this is the work of the Gospel. Now from the work of the Gospel three
things are to be found out:

1. What the Gospel is. 2. What it works in us. 3. In what manner it works.
First then, the Gospel is, That part of the word of God, which contains a
most happy and welcome message of two things:

1. That Mankind is fully Redeemed by the death of Christ. 2. That all who
will repent and believe shall be partakers of it.
This is the happy and glad tidings of the Gospel, by which we understand,
that there is deliverance and Redemption by means of Christ: and that we may
know who be thus privileged; so that in the Gospel two things are to be
considered;

1. What is the benefit of the Gospel. 2. Upon what Condition?
Now the special and maine thing that is promised in the Gospel is,
Redemption, that is, life and salvation by the means of Christ, this I say is
the special work of the Gospel. There are many comforts in the Gospel, many
promises of God offered unto us: the conquest of sin, death and hell, the
forsaking of the world, but the special maine thing is Life, Salvation, and
Redemption by Christ, as St. Paul brings it, Romans 1. 16. For I am not ashamed
of Romans 1. 16.
the Gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation, etc. and 2.
Tim. 1. 10. heesayes, who has abolished 2. Tim. 1. 10.
death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel: and
Act. 6. 10. says he, send for Peter, he Act. 6. 10.
shall tell thee what thou ought to do; so that you see the special and
the maine thing in the Gospel is Life and Salvation.

This being so, two uses are so made of the Gospel, To see what every man
ought, ^r (...) required to do by the Gospel, To renounce the world, and the
vanities of life, and renew our estate by the benifite of Christ's death, laying
hold of him by Faith, whereby at last we shall be sure of our Redemtion which
brings life and salvation: as 1 Thessalonians. 4. 18. the Apostle says, Wherefore
comfort your 1 Thessalonians 4, 18.
selves one another with these words, What words? to be exhorted to holiness,
innooencie, love, labor, moderate mourning for the dead, to know the end of
the Resurrection, all which and many other, are comprised in the Gospel, and
tend to salvation. So 1. Pet. 1. 8. We (says he) 1. Pet. 1. 8.
Rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorious, to be in hope of eternal life; So
as I have said, you see by this, the first use we may make of it, is to
labor and endeavor for life everlasting and salvation, never regarding the
afflictions and troubles of this life, which endure not, and are not comparable
unto that crown, such shall receive who strive as they ought; For though there
be pain and trouble in the way, yet there is much comfort and peace at the
end of the journey. I make no question but the passing of the children of
Israel through the Wilderness into the land of Canaan, was a type of Celestial
Jerusalem, for as they endured Wilderness passage.
many troubles, wants, and distresses in that Wilderness, famine, drought,
hear, tedious and wearisome iourneys, not without repining and murmuring,
before they came into the land of Canaan, yea, when they were ready to enter
and take possession, there was wars, fear, Giants, Iron gates, and high
walls in their way, etc. Even so do and must Gods children go through the
wilderness of this world ere they come to heaven and life everlasting, many
afflictions, much sadness of heart, poverty, scorns, despights, weaknesses,
passions, repining and many murmurings against God himself, yet at last the
promises of the Gospel, and hope of eternal life, makes their joy glorious
and unspeakable, and they enter into this Celestial Canaan, maugre all the
opposition of principalities and powers, and all their spiritual enemies:
whilst hope bears them up, and they believe they shall have a blessed issue
of all their troubles and afflictions in the end. For as a man passing over a
deep and dangerous river into some delicate Deep water.
meadow full of variety of good things, endures all the storms, and
perilous blasts of wind, or threatening of the tempest, in hope of the
possession of the pleasures of the place, so fares it with such who mean to
make use of the Gospel: the hope of eternal life and salvation, must
extinguish all fears of our dangerous passages in this world, and overcome all
difficulties for our better coming to heaven, and this be said of the first
use, seeing life and salvation are thus proposed unto us by the Gospel of
Jesus Christ. The other use we have to make, or work we have to do, is to
know how we may compass this; and what we must practice to attain it, in
brief this must be done by

Faith and Repentance.
For the first of these, Faith is so excellent a thing, and so absolutely
needful to attain the privileges of the Gospel, as without this we can do
nothing: and until this be lost or weakened, we are safe and comfortable in
all estates. For, as though a man fall into the hands of thieves, Man in fear.
although they rob and spoil him of all he has, yea, leave him stark naked
in a wilderness to wind and weather, yet if they take not away his life,
there is some hope of recovery, and a man may be restored again to a former
estate, and labor to get more wealth, so fares it with Gods children in the
wilderness of this world, although they are robbed, spoiled, and bereaved of
earthly blessings, denied honor, riches, preferment; yea, left naked as it
were in the Sun, yet as long as faith remains, and that they are constant in
the believe of the promises of the Gospel, all other difficulties are overcome
by this grace, and life everlasting which surmounteth all the rest, attained
unto at the last: how should every one of us then labor to pray for it, to
nurse and entertain this so excellent and profitable Jewel of faith: to live
by it, stand by it, walk by it, and do and suffer all things in faith (as our
forefathers of blessed memory) many of them have done. The commendation
thereof, with the many rare effects thereof is excellently set down, Heb. 11.
all which being a depth Heb, 11.
beyond that compass we now intend to wade into: We will by your patience
leave to entreat of it now, and come to that we especially intend, which is
the second thing required of us for the attaining of life and salvation through
Jesus Christ, which is,

Repentance.
If you read, 2. King. 5. 3. you shall find what Naamans little maid said:
Would to God my Lord were with the Prophet 2. King. 5. 3. Naamans Maid.
that is in Samaria, he would soon deliver him of his leprosy: so says the
Gospel unto us; Oh that you would come unto Christ, seek after him by a
lively faith and true repentance for your sins, he would deliver you from
the threatening of the Law, and release you of those impossible conditions which
there you are bound unto; he would conquer death and hell for your sake, and
pay the ransom for your sins, and in the end by his Redemption bring you
unto life everlasting. Thus must we needs fly for refuge unto the death and
passion of Christ. I confess that there is both life and death in the Law, as
there is Salvation and Redemption in the Gospel; but the Law (as I said)
binds us unto conditions which we can never perform, whereas the Gospel
proposes life and salvation upon more easier terms, Then do and live; or Do
not, and perish: only to believe and repent, and run unto Christ, and he
will heal us of our leprosy.

This then is the difference betwixt the Law and Gospel; The Law proffers life
and salvation unto us, if we can keep the Law and never sin against God.
The Gospel gives us hope of Life and Salvation, though we cannot perform the
Law, so we believe and repent, which are far easier conditions then actual
holiness, tying us strictly to the observation of the common (...) ^ding unto
the spiritual meaning of the same: so you see how the Gospel proffers us life
and salvation upon far more easy terms then the Law does, which should
make us so much the more diligent to see into the mysteries of the Gospel,
whereso great privileges are granted unto us, and admire that depth of
wisdom that has thus tempered the severity of the Law toward us, even when
death was in the pot.

Of this there be two uses.
that every Christian must endeavor to keep himself from sin, to live
well, and labor in the practice of a holy life; But if he fall and sin by
weakness and frailty, and fail in his course and race running, then he must
fly unto Jesus Christ; Believe the promises of the Gospel, be of good
comfort in the Redemption of his soul; and remember that which Saint Paul
says, Romans 7. The good which I would do, I do not, and the Romans 7.
evil which I would not do, that do I.

That we must take heed that we live not in notorious known sin, for the
world is so full of wickedness and impiety, that many dare say, what though I
sin thus and thus, yet by repentance I hope to be saved. Yea, many gross
swearers, liars, aduherers, and such like, can profane godliness in this
manner; I hope for all this to go to heaven as well as the best, Christ said
he came to save, not to destroy the world, and such like. But the true
Christian only he may make a comfortable use of the Gospel, and apply these
speeches to the comfort of his soul, not the other. And thereforee in the name
of God let us apply our selves unto the search of these things now whilst it is
called to day, and whilst the time of salvation endures: for if now we (...)
our time, though we should give a thousand worlds for it, we cannot have it
here after this life. If a man come to the market and cheapen such things as
he has need of, Market cheapning.
and yet will not go to the price of them, he must return without them; even
so, seeing we hear at what price God has see life and salvation, that they
are not to be purchased, but at the price of Faith and Repentance; and that
God will not let them go at a lower rate, let us resolve that they will not
be gotten otherwise, so that if we mean not to come to the price; or cannot
come unto Faith and Repentance, we must be content to go home again without
Life and Salvation. And thus much generally for the conditions of the Gospel.

Now for the Particulars in Repentance, there are many worthy heads to be
considered: as,

1. The Necessity of it, we cannot be saved without it. 2. The Order of it
with other Graces. 3. The Nature of it. 4. The Causes of Repentance. 5. The
Time of it. 6. The Practice of it. 7. The Le^s of it. 8. The Cases of
Repentance, etc. 9. Contraries unto it. 10. Increase of it.
1. NECESSITY OF Repentance.
First for the Necessity thereof, Repentance is such a necessary grace, as no
man can be saved without it, for there be but two estates wherein every man
living may beesaued, the state of Innocencts, and the state of Penitencie, unto
which belongs the Grace of Faith. Now no man living ever after the fall of Adam
can be saved in the state of Innocence, because we be all sinners and
grievous sinners before the Majesty of God, so then he that will be saved
must be saved in the state of Penitencie.

There be but two pleas that any man can make when he shall stand before God
in fear of Judgment. Either Non peccaui Domine, Lord I have not sinned: or
Domine peccaui, Lord I have sinned, Sed poenitet peccasse, it repents me that I
have sinned and offended. Now no man living can stand before God in the
strength of this first plea, Non peccaui: Lord I have not sinned: For Iam 3. 2.
it is written in many things we sin all, and Iam. 3. 2.
1. John 1. 8. If we say we have no sin we deceive our 1. John 1. 2. 1.
King 8 46.
selves: And Solomon in his prayer has it thus, 1. King. 8. 46. if they sin
against thee, for there is no man that sins not. So then, seeing no man
living can lay hold on the former plea, Non Paccani, let us all lay hold on the
latter, Peccaui, sed poenitel peccasse, we have sinned and offended, but it
repents us that we have so done. And thus we see that Repentance is such a
saving grace, as no man living can be saved without it, and the Scriptures
also agree to this thing, Act. 11. 18. Then has God Act. 11. 18.
also granted Repentance unto life, etc. whereby we see that no man can come
to life, but by Repentance, 2. Pet. 2. Pet. 3. 9.
3. 9. he says, Not willing that any should pperish, But that all should come
to Repentance; so then if a man will not persist in his sins, the only way
is, to come to Repentance when God wills him, 2. Tim. 2. 25. he says 2. Tim.
2. 25.
to this purpose: If God peradventure will give them Repentance to the
acknowledging of the truth; by all which is apparent, that no man can come out
of the snares of Death, but by Repentance, and so we may conclude that
Repentance is a necessary Grace, without which we cannot come to life and
Salvation. Of this there be diverse

Uses.
That we renew our Repentance daily, for so far as a man is from Repentance,
so far he is from the Grace of life. Now in Repentance we must not take
this liberty to suppose that some sober and sad thoughts (as we term them)
of Repentance will serve the turn: O what do we in such slight accounts, but
even cast away the salvation of our own souls? For as we hear, Repentance is
such a necessary grace, that whosoever casts away Repentance, casts away the
salvation of his own foul. We read Ruth 4. 5. 6. that when offer was Ruth.
4. 5. 6.
made to the kinsman to redeem the land, he was contented till it came to the
purchasing of Ruth the Moabitish Ruth.
woman at the hands of Naomi, then he gave over and resigned his interest to
Boas: even so it is with a number of men, they would willingly come to heaven
to purchase the field, that is, come to the happy estate of salvation and the
kingdom of God, but they will not have it at the hands of Repentance, they
will not be humbled for their sins, they will not forsake the world, this is
the reason why a number will lose eternal life, rather then forsake the
pleasures of the world, and these sinful vanities which continue so short a
time: and produce nothing but bitterness and vexation of mind in the end.

That all those who have not already repented, must now repent, if they desire
to come unto God to be saved: and behold God in his glory, or look to stand
justified before Christ: seeing that without this Repentance, there is no
promise that does belong unto thee. Indeed, if a man care not for these things,
salvation and eternal life, if he do not desire to be saved, to see God on
his glory, stand before Christ, etc. then let him line as he lift, and enjoy
the pleasures of this world. But if he care for these things, look after the
glory of the life to come, desire the benefit of Salvation, then let him
repent, if he have not repented already, lest it come too late, and a worse
thing befall him; for it is a dangerous thing to withstand and let slip the fit
seasons of Repentance, when Gods extraordinary calls and mercies inuit us
thereunto: and when he inlightens the eyes to see better things. As Act. 17.
30. the holy Ghost shows: And the times of this Act. 17. 30.
ignorance God wincked at, but now commands all men every where to repent;
The meaning of this is, that howsoever he did less regard this in the times
of Ignorance, when men took no care of these things, yet now that they know
from the light of the Gospel, what is to be done, every man must repent and
come unto God. It must be our care to provoke our selves unto Repentance for
our sins, to pray God that we may be healed and humbled, as we shall hear
hereafter. Every sin that we commit in this world must have a Repentance,
for if we repent not here on earth, we shall not repent either in Heaven or
hell; And therefore seeing Repentance is so necessary, let us now repent, if
we have not repented already: for delays are dangerous, and repentance is not
in our power; besides that, diverse accidents may come which may hinder us in
this great work of Grace.

If a man have not truly Repented, he must seek to mend it; we see in
Nature, that if a bone be set awry, Bone awry.
the Surgeon has no way to help it, but to break it again, and to set it
right. And even so must a man do by his Repentance; if he have not truly
repented his sins, he must renew his Repentance, conceive new grief, shed
fresh tears, and practice all the good Rules of Penitencie. We see in reason,
if a man come to a great ditch to leap over, if he miss his rise, yet he
will go A Ditch.
back again and again, and take his best advantage, rather then he will
fall in the midst: Even so must we do, rather then fall into the midst of
Hell, of eternal death, to be damned with the devil and his angels; We must
be contented to set upon our Repentance again and again, go choose and
practice new grief, sorrow and compunction, rather then to perish for ever.

II. THE ORDER OF REPENTANCE with other Graces.
The second thing we are to consider in the doctrine of Repentance, is, The
Order of it compared with other Graces; For this I conceive, that in order of
Nature, Faith is before Repentance, but ordinarily, Repentance shows it self
before Faith in the life of a Christian. Even as when a candle is brought into
a room, the candle light first shows it self before the candle come into
Candle.
the room; though it be true there was the candle before there was light: so
it is with these two Graces, Faith and Repentance, first there must be Faith
before there can be Repentance, and yet commonly we see the fruits of
Repentance before we can see the fruits of Faith. And so they are usually so
placed in the Scriptures, Act. 20. 21. Repentance toward God, and faith
toward our Act. 20. 21.
Lord Jesus. And Heb. 6. 1. says he; Not laying again Heb. 6. 1.
the foundation of Repentance from dead works, and of Faith toward God.

Now that Faith is before Repentance in order of Grace, it is made probable by
this one Reason, in stead of many. Repentance, as we know, is a sanctified
Grace of God; for no man can repent unless he hate sin, and no man can hate
sin unless he be sanctified. But there can be no sanctified Graces in a
Christian without Faith, Argument.
Heb. 11. 6. But without faith it is impossible to please God, for he that
comes to God, must believe that he is: Heb. 11. 6.
and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. So then we see
that there can be no Repentance without faith: and Faith in order of nature is
before Repentance. So it may be a general comfort to a man, that howsoever
he do not feel Faith in himself, yet he may assure himself that he has
Faith, if he have Repentance for his sins, and a desire to reform himself,
from a sorrow and shame, that he has thus long offended God; because there is
no Repentance without Faith. Therefore be assured whosoever thou art, if there
be a Repentance and Humiliation for sin, make no doubt of thy faith, (though
(as I said) thou do not feel it) seeing Faith goes before Repentance.

Now for the better consideration of this, we must know, The Difference
between the works of Faith and true Repentance. First, the Act or work of
true Faith is 1 Act of Faith. 2 Act of Faith.
generally to believe the promises of the Gospel, that all men who repent and
believe shall be saved. The second Act or work of Faith is to believe that
the promises be proposed, but with a condition, If I my self can believe and
repent, I shall be saved. Now when a man has this work of Faith in himself,
this makes him labor to repent his sins, to believe in Christ, and when he
has repented and believed; then follows the great 3 Act of Faith.
act of Faith, whereby a man believes, that his sins are pardoned, and his
soul shall be saved: and so some acts of Faith gee before Repentance, and
some follow after.

Then, that Repentance shows it self before Faith in the life of a Christian,
is most evident and plain. For first a man must needs be humbled for his
sins, he must groan under the burden of them, and cry to heaven against
them, before he can lay hold by Faith, that they nee pardoned and ^itted: So
we see David, 2. Sam. 12. 13. he was humbled for his sin, before he 1.
Sam. 12. 13.
could perceive and persuade himself that his sin was pardoned, or receive
comfort. I have sinned against the Lord, and then follows, The Lord also has
put away thy sin, thou shall not die. Many are the examples in the book of
God, where we may see how the most part of the people of God were well and
truly humbled by Repentance before Faith raised them. But here some may say.
How comes it to pass then that some have been comforted by Faith who were but
slenderly if at all humbled by Repentance, as we see in Lydia, Act. 16. 14.
whose Act. 16. 14.
heart the Lord opened; that she attended the things that were spoken? And in
the Eunuch, Act. 8. 39. of whom it it is said presently upon his hearing of the
word from the mouth of Philip, And he went on his way rejoicing. he
apprehends more strongly the one, and sometimes the other: that so accordingly
is his joy or sorrow great or small. And therefore if a man in his first
conversion, have a more strong apprehension of his own sins, and all his
thoughts is carried upon the beholding of his miseries and woeful estate, this
makes him to lament and mourn bitterly, many a day together: but if at his
first conversion, with a sight of sin, a man behold such an infinite sea and
depth of Gods mercies, as is far beyond all his sins: and the infinite
merit of the death and sufferings of the Son of God; Even as Flakes of fire
Flakes of fire.
falling into the Ocean sea, are quenched with the abundance of water: so all
his sins falling into the maine sea and Ocean of Gods mercy in Christ, are
all covered and put out: so as his heart is filled with joy and gladness as it
fell out with Lydia and the Eunueh, Act. 8. and others.

LECT. III.
III. THE NATVRE OF Repentance.
ISAIAH. 1. 16. Wash ye, make you clean, put away the Evil of your doings,
from before mine eyes, Cease to do evil, Learn to do well, etc.
I Have read in the stories of this time, that they which travel into Virginia
and Guiana, or among those savage and desolate countries, carry a Tinderboxe
with them, and when night comes they make a fire, or light up a candle, to see
where to sleep and rest the more safely. Even so God has left us his holy
Word, to be as a tinderboxe unto us, to strike fire and light up Tinder-boxe.
a candle, to direct us through the dark wilderness of this world, so as they
who will see the mercies of God, must take the book of God into their hands,
and as by striking of fire the traveler is the safer, and has the means of
light to direct how, and when to rest, so must we raise a light out of Gods
word, to convey us home to heaven; Therefore of all other things, let us take
heed that we do not despise this kindness and goodness of the Lord, whose
bounty leads us unto Repentance: of which I spoke the last day. First, we
have heard the Necessity of it. Secondly, the Order of it with other graces:
and now in the third place, we are to treat of The Nature of Repentance; and
of this the rather, because there is a kind of Faith and Repentance which
deceiues us in their Nature, for there are a number of men and women, that have
a show of Repentance, and think themselves in a good estate, and well enough,
when indeed they are not, and have but a mere shadow of Grace, so that we may
not be deceived in a matter of such moment and weight, I have thought it good
to make it known unto you, what is the true Nature of Repentance.

some sorrow for sin, so that when the hand of God is upon him, or that he
lies sick, lame, or any way perplexed; if he then can vent some few sighs,
and say, Lord have mercy upon me a sinner: I am sorry that I have offended, he
supposes it is Repentance: but this, Ahab did and more: this 1. king. 21. 27.
Math. 27. (...).
Judas did with public confession, yet never repented: so that if outward
sorrow for sin, or a sad look, or a sigh or such like were true Repentance,
what Reprobate is there almost in the world, but does this and many a day? Yea,
such as live in gross and known sins, can cry to God for mercy, and
confess their offenses, and think they have obtained a grace from God in so
doing, seeming sorry for their sins, though yet they live in known sins,
as I said against their own conscience, and continue presumptuously in their
wickedness; Yea, how many thousands are there who never obtained any grace or
mercy at all to be sorry for their sins? O how far short are these men
from Repentance! to think that a little sorrow for sin is it.

many think that the leaning of some notorious gross sin is Repentance,
though the whole life be still full of corruption and impiety. No, no, they
are deceived, for a man may leave his gross sins, and yet never repent; yea,
leave them for a while, and yet return to them again: As you see how David
left his Adultery 2. Sam. 12.
at the first, before God gave him grace to repent, and desist a while from
many sins after this: And yet was overtaken again foully in many things
contriuing against Uriah. So then you see that a man may be sorry for his
sin without repentance.

some think that every godly motion is Repentance, so that if a man have but a
thought of God, and desire of Grace, by and by it is Repentance: But this Herod
had, and did many things after John Baptists preaching gladly: This Agrippa
had, when he told Act. 26. 28.
Paul, Thou almost perswadest me to be a Christian. Thus many attain unto
good motions, and have a mind as it were to true Repentance, and yet come
far short of it: these be the counterfeits of Repentance.

Thus having heard Repentance what it is not? let us see Affirmatively what it
is: It is an absolute change of Definition of Repentance.
the whole man in purpose of heart and turning him to God and godliness, from
his former courses and wicked life: So that it has four things in it; First,
it is a change of a man. Secondly, it is a change of the whole man. Thirdly, it
is such a change as turns him in purpose of heart from all sins. Fourthly,
such a change as turns a man from all sins unto God.

First, It is a change, as we may see Romans 12. 2. And be not conformed to
this world, but be you transformed 1 Romans 12. 2.
by the renewing of your mind, And therefore where there is no change from the
former natural estate, there can be no Repentance; As bring fire into a room,
and it will Fire.
make a change in the room; it will make it light and warm, and sweet, etc.
Even so if a man truly repent, it will make a change in his heart, in his life,
in his carriage, speeches and conversation. It will make a proud man humbled, a
Covetous man to be liberal, a Drunkard to be sober and temperate; and an
Adulterer to be chaste; stubbornness it will change into gentleness and
affability; to be brief, of impenitent, it will make one penitent: As St.
Paul says of himself to Timothy, I was a Blasphemer and a Persecuter, but
Lord thou show 2. Tim.
mercy, it is otherwise with me now. So 1. Pet. he 1. Pet.
says, We were as sheep gone astray, but now we are turned unto the
shepherd and Bishop of our souls. Therefore though men speak well, yet is
this no true Repentance, unless they be changed and renewed in their minds,
and in their lives. We see Ierem. 3. 25. There Ier. 3. 25.
the people spoke well, for they said, Thou art my God and the guide of my
youth, and yet the Lord complains of them: We lie down in our shame, and our
confusion covers us; for we have sinned, we and our fathers from our youth,
even to this day. So that Repentance is a change.

It is a change of the whole man, not in one part, but in all and every part,
of the judgment, will and affections, of the inward and of the outward man
wholly diffused. As when one puts wine into a glass where water is, it Wine in
a glass.
runs into every part thereof, and transformeth it self through all the
water. So is it with the grace of Repentance, it does not rest in one part, but
it transferres it self into every part of a man, it changes the judgment; it
changes the will, it changes the affections, it changes every faculty both
outward and inward, in all the parts and powers of soul and body. Wherefore if
a man be changed in one part and not in another, it is not Repentance.

If a man must be changed in every part, then there is a perfection in our
Repentance, it may be perfect.

Of all the parts to have them changed: Secondly, There is a perfection in
every part; as we see in a child, there is all the parts of a man in it: as
hands, A child.
arms, legs and so forth, but there is not perfection in those parts, it is
not come to the full strength and growth: only this is attained by degrees
through the nourishment it takes: So it is in the work of Repentance, this
makes a change in every part, so that every part is perfect in the part, though
every part be not come to perfection. Augustine makes it plain, says he,
when a man has had sickness, and is recovered again, there is health in all
the parts, although he be not so perfectly Health.
recovered as to walk abroad, and have not ability to do this or that thing:
and thus where there is true Repentance, there is a change in every part,
First, There is a change of the Mind and Judgment, that whereas it The change
Repentance works. 1 In the Judgment.
did like well of sin and approve of it, and to say in defense thereof with
Jonas, I did well to be angry, I did well to swear, I did well to lie, I did
well to profane the Sabbath, I did well to backbite my Neighbor, to deceive
and cozen, and such like. When Repentance comes, it changes all so, that
whereas before one did like well of sin, now one does quite dislike and
distaste it, and is ready to fling the first stone at it. See this in David, 2.
Sam. 24. 14. he thought he had done 2. Sam. 24. 14.
well in cauling to number the people. No body could have persuaded him to the
contrary: But when Repentance came, it made a change in his Judgment, and made
him confess that He had done very foolishly. So Paul was of this mind, he
thought he had done well in persecuting the Saints, and shutting them up in
Prison, in wasting and making a havoc of the Church: doing of many things
contrary to the Saints. But Repentance wrought a change in his judgment: Oh
(says he) I did this ignorantly: I did not know it was a sin to do so.
Therefore where there is not a dislike of sin, but a delight in it, there is no
true repentance; because Repentance so changes the judgment, as it makes them
say with the Lepers, 2. King. We do not well to stay here 2. King.
so long, let us go and remove, etc. So Repentance will make men say, we did
not well to be angry, swear, etc.

So likewise True Repentance makes a change in the Will, both in regard of
sins past, as likewise in respect of 2 In the will.
sins to come: David have given after his Repentance for his Adultery and
murder, that he had never committed the same, yea any thing. What would not
Peter have given that he had never denied his Master? which made him shed so
many tears. It is true, when sin is once committed, all the powers in Heaven
and Earth cannot undo it again. Only Repentance does as much as may be, to
make sin no sin in effect.

It makes a Change in regard of sins that are to come, They would not do any
thing willingly that would offend God, or to grieve the holy Spirit: So we see
in Job 40. 5. Once (says he) I have spoken, but I will speak no more, yea
twice, but I will proceed no further, Job. 40. 5.
and 1. Pet. 4. 3. says he, It is sufficient that we have 1. Pet. 4. 3.
spent the time past after the lusts of the flesh: and Paul, Romans 7. says, The
good that I would do that I do not: Rom 7.
and the evil I would not do, that do I. As if he would say, I would not
grieve the spirit: I would not offend God for a world, but my corruptions carry
me so unto it, that I cannot choose: Therefore if there be a willingness to
sin, there is no true repentance.

3 In the Affections.
So likewise it makes a Change in the Affections. Ierem. 31. it is said, I have
surely heard Ephraim lamenting, Ierem. 31.
thou have chastised me and I was chastised. And Psalm. 6. David confesses that
he did water his couch with tears. Chrysostom on this place says well; If
so Psalm. 6.
great a King did lament and weep for his sins, so great a Prophet, and so
holy a man did shed tears, and that not for an hour, but for a long time, not
for a night, but many nights, not a drop or two, but he did water his bed with
them: how much more ought we to grieve and lament, and shed tears for our
sins, that are a great many more. For the next, whereas before we committed
sin with boldness, we now become ashamed of it, and therefore if we can
sin and not be ashamed of it, but bear it out with boldness of face, it is
a sign our repentance is not true. By the contrary, if when we have committed
sin, we are abashed and ashamed to look any body in the face, so that we
could be contented to live in a Cave or a dungeon, or some such secret place,
after the fact, it is a good sign, saying, The time has been when I was so
brutish and s^esse, that I could have been contented to have committed sin
in the sight of the Sun with boldness, but now I shame to think of it, if
it be thus with us, it is a sign of true repentance. As Jeremy in the person
of the faithful says, Ierem. 3. 25. I lie down in confusion, and we cover
Ier. 3. 23.
our selves with shame. So the Publican was ashamed, and durst not lift up his
eyes to heaven, but he smote himself upon the breast, and said, The Lord be
merciful Luke 8. 13.
to me a sinner. And lastly, whereas before we took delight in sin, now
we hate, detest, and abhor it, whereas our delight was in the ways of
vanity, and that the pleasures of sin have been meat and drink to us, we
now begin to hate the delights of this life, even as Ammon, 2. Sam. 13. 13.
after he had by inordinate 2 Samuel 13 13. Ammon. Thamar.
love desired his sister Thamar; did hate her after so much the more: So must
we deal with our best beloved sins, hate them as much or more, as ever we
formerly loved them. And therefore if so be we see in us renewed and changed
affections from that we were, from evil to good, this is a sign of true
Repentance, when such a change and alteration is wrought in our Inward Man.

Now, (...) Repentance makes a change in the Inward man: so does it in the
Outward also in our Actions: not 2 Change in the outward man.
only renewing our heart, but our whole life, that whereas in the best part
thereof, we have done service unto sin, it makes us now do service unto
Christ; yea, that we never thought to do: as in the Parable of the two
sons: the one said, he would not go, yet after Math. 21. 28.
repentance he went and did clean contrary. So in the history of Mary
Magdalen, O Lord? how were all Mary Magdalen.
her actions changed, when she was changed by repentance, she that was wont
to sit in glory at sumptuous Feasts and banquees, leaves all now to sit down
at Jesus feet upon the ground: She that was woo^t to clip and kiss her
lovers with ^^^ton embraces, left all to kiss the feet of her Savior, she
that had curled her hair, and had dressed it with Pearl and costlinesse for
wicked and intis^g purposes, let it now hang loosely about her face and head to
be a towell to wipe the feet of Jesus, she that had wandering eyes, and thought
upon nothing but smiles and pleasure, makes them now a fountain of tears to
wash her Saviors feet. Her ears which were open to hear nothing but music
and filthy talk, now are ready to hear Christ speaking unto her: her feet
which formerly carried her into vain company, are now the instruments to
bring her into the house of God: and that tongue which before spoke filthily,
idly and loosely, is now employed in the praises of God: and so forth for all
her gesture and apparel, etc. O! what an alteration was here? what a change
did Repentance work, through soul and body in the inward and outward man.
And thus must it work upon us all, or else we come not near the nature of
true Repentance. For true Repentance works upon sinners in the same manner:
The hands now take up a Bible, and with as great delight read the word of God,
as they before followed their sports: the feet that carried the body to houses
of iniquity, are now as ready to carry them to the house of Christ: the Ears
that were wont to hearken to lascivious talk, and be taken with amorous
loue-songs, are now attentive to Sermons and the word of God. The eyes that
were rouling about to meet with temptations, are now fixed on a Preacher, and
have a covenant made with them: In a word, the heart and affection that was
fraughted with sinful and idle fancies and motions, are now full of holy
meditations, and busied with divine exercises.

that we must not only be changed in part, but we must be turned from all
sin: as David says, Psalm. 119. Psalm. 119 101.
I have refrained my feet from every evil way: That I may keep thy word; so
that if we turn from one sin or from many sins, and not from all and
every sin, it is not true repentance; Ahab and Judas turned from one sin,
but not from all: he repented of betraying his Master, but not of his other
sins of covetousness, etc. therefore he fell into despair. who lives and
sins not in some sin or other: for St. James says; In many things we
sin all. Unto which Iam^^. 1. John.
it is added, 1. John. If we say that we have no sin in us, we do but
deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us. How then can we turn from
every sin? We must turn away from all sin, though all sin do^ not turn
away from us: but is ready to catch hold of and follow us, so must we deal
with all sin, as Samuel did with Saul. Samuel resolved to depart and went 1.
Sam.
away from Saul: But Saul caught hold of him and would not let him go: So must
we depart from all sin, in resolution and endeavor, part company, turn
back, look down, and frown upon all: though it be true that sin will pull
us back, catch and lay hold upon us, stay us against our will: this much is
all we can do whilst we dwell in these houses of clay.

Jeremy has it; O Israel! If thou return, return unto me, says the Lord. I
but how should we turn unto God? but we must turn to him as the guider and
governor of our lives. Because many are well contented to have God their
Savior and Redeemer, who reject him for the guide and governor of their lives.

LECT. IIII.
IIII. THE CAUSES OF Repentance.
ACT. 11. 18. When they heard these things they held their peace, and glorified
God, saying, then has God also unto the Gentiles granted Repentance unto life.
WE showed unto you the last day the true Nature of Repentance, lest any one
should be deceived in a matter of so great moment, and think that he has
this Grace, when indeed he has but a show and shadow thereof: wherein we
considered four things; First, that Repentance was a change in a man,
Secondly, that it was a change of the whole man^ ^hirdly, that it was such a
change as made a man leave and turn from all sin. Fourthly, that it is such
a change as turns a man from all sin unto God: As Act. 26. 20, it is said,
That they should Repent and turn to God, and do^ acts meet Act. 26. 20.
for Repentance. So that repentance is a turning unto God. By sin a man is
auerted and turned away from him, by Repentance a man turns unto God again,
as one willing to be governed and guided by him in all his courses: for unless
this be, it can be no true Repentance. The nature whereof is, as we have
heard at large: It remains in the next place that we come to treat of The
causes of Repentance, which are of three sorts.

The principal efficient cause is God, for it is God only who can make us
repent, no man can work it, we cannot compass it our selves, but God must
work it by the graces of his holy Spirit: as Paul has it, 2. Tim. 2. 25.
says he, Proouing if God peradventure will 2. Tim. 2. 25.
give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth. Whereby he proves
that God only is the giver of Repentance, and no good duty can be performed
unless God stir a man up unto the same: So acknowledges the Church of the
Greeks, Act. 11. 18. Act. 11. 28.
Then has God also to the Gentiles granted Repentance unto life, And Deuteronomy. 4.
29. it is there said, in Moses exhortation, Deuteronomy. 4. 29.
Yet the Lord has not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and
ears to hear unto this day. So that God is the principal cause of Repentance.

A number think that Repentance is a work in a man's own power, that it is
like the Apothecaries. Physic Physic.
which a man may set in his window and take it as his stomach serves him: So
they think that Repentance may rest upon a man's own will; yea, many presume
to say, that if they may have but one hour to repent in before the day of
death, it is as good as though they had had a whole year to think upon it.
But you see that Repentance is not in our power, it is a gift, a work of God,
so that we cannot repent when we will, but when God will: therefore it must
be our care to take repentance when God proffers it, and wills it. Look in
the story of Esau. Heb. 12. 17. he once refused it, and sought it afterward
with tears, but could not obtain Heb. 12. 17.
his father to reuerse the blessing: much less could he sue to God for mercy.
So then, take heed of despising Gods mercy, for if a man will not take
repentance when God offers it, he may seek it; yea, seek it with tears, and
yet because he despised and neglected it, when it was offered unto him, he may
go without it. Therefore take notice, that the spirit is willing to work life
in thee, and breed good motions; therefore do thou take heed to cherish these
good motions of repentance, holy thoughts and resolutions, lost when thou
would have it, thou be refused.

The Papists who hold the doctrine of Free Will, say, P. P.
that if God make a motion of Repentance, it is in a man's own power to repent,
or not to repent, as if a man should show a horse a bottle of Hay: that it is
without Bottle of Hay.
doubt that by and by he will run after it; so say they, let God make but
the motion, by and by, man by the power of his own Free Will, will run to
embrace it, but the truth is, such is the estate of a sinner; that he is in a
worse estate then a beast. For to come to their own comparison of a Horse and
Hay. Coeco nulla cupide. Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy. 29. 3.
29. 3. says he, Yet the Lord has not given you a hear to perceive, and
eyes to see, and ears to hear unto this day. Secondly, man has neither
desire nor appetite till God work it in him, as it is, Phil. 2. 13. For it is
God which works in you both the will and the deed, (or to Phil. 2. 13.
will and to do) of his good pleasure. Thirdly, though we had eyes to see
good things, and will to delight in them, yet have we no strength and power to
perform them until God will: as John 15. 5. For without me you can do
nothing. So then, this is the doctrine of Repentance, John 15. 5.
that if God work not in a man these motions by his power, there is no
repentance. Nay, we see God only works man unto repentance by the power of
his Spirit and Grace, so that he is the first Cause of Repentance. Of which
let this be

The Use.
Iom. 1. 5.
God only, we must say (as St. James says) If any man lack wisdom, let him
ask of God that gives unto all men liberally, etc. So let us say of
Repentance, if any man lack repentance, let him ask it of God, and he will
give it him. It is said of the Rock, Psalm. 78. 20. Behold he smote the Rock
that the waters gushed out, and the streams ouerflowed, etc. Even so let us
pray God by the power of his Spirit, and grace to smite so hard upon our rockie
hearts, that by and by may gush out from us floods of repentant tears.



Second Cause of Repentance, is called The Isntrumental Cause: and that is,
the preaching of the Word as it is, Luke 24. 27. says he, And that Repentance
and remission of sins should be preached in his Name amongst all Nations, so
that preaching is the Isntrumental cause thereof, for though God give
Repentance (it being wrought by him in us) yet he does it by means, we must
not think that God will open the Clouds and come down from heaven, and pour
Repentance into our hearts, or drop it in us, but he has ordained that we
shall get it by the preaching of the Word, for thereby we are made partakers
of the graces of his holy Spirit. Now consider there are two things to effect
this, The Preaching of the Law, and the preaching of the Gospel, the first
that a man may see his sin, and the fearful estate he is in by the same:
The second, that he may find there is a remedy, and that it is not in
himself. The Law prepares a man for Repentance, shows him all his sins, and
his damnable estate before; yea, it terrifies the conscience even to the very
flinging of him down to hell: and though this be not an infallible sign of
grace to be thus terrified and restrained, yet it is the occasion of it,
because it helps to prepare us, and make us willing to lay hold of Repentance
as God works in us. As a man that makes choice of a tree to build with, Tree.
first he cuts it down with his axe, ere he lay it flat upon the ground, and
when he has done so, then he applies his line and tools unto lopping the
boughs, and so hewes it, and squares it to make it the fitter for his work.
Even so does the Lord; first he beats a man flat down with the sentence of
the Law and horror of his sin, and then he lifts him up and restores him
with the promises of the Gospel: And whereas many think that it is a strange
work of God to deal thus with a man, and that when God does deal thus, that
man is in a woeful and lamentable estate: the truth is, that then the Law (from
God) is a fitting and working a man, to be fit for eternal life, and thus
though the Law cannot bring a man to Repentance, yet it is a means of
preparation: And then after this comes the Gospel, as a powerful
instrument, and works Faith and other Graces in us by a divine assistance.

The use is,
Physic.
herb did grow which applied would quickly rid him of all his pain and
grief; if he had any means to come by it, sure he would creep thither upon
his hands and his feet to have it, no pains would be irksome unto him, so
he might recover his health again, even so when a man is deadly sick of
sin (as we should all be) and it shall be told him that in the preaching
of the Gospel, there is such a herb of Grace, the Flower of Repentance, that
will cure him of his sin, and restore him to the life of glory, I hope no
man is so desperate and careless, that will neglect the hearing of it. Now
what shall we do in this case, but as it were to creep on our hands and
knees, that is, to use all means to attain the same, and be partakers of the
benefits of the Gospel, that we may be saved: O! shall we be more
careful in such a case of our bodies then of our souls?

3 Helping Causes of Repentance.
Now besides these two Causes, that may bring us unto Repentance: there be
other three causes, which are called Cause adiuvantes; Helping or furthering
causes, because though they do not work Repentance in themselves, yet they
do exercise a man to the helping and furthering of this work in him: I
declare it by a similitude, when one would saw a Tree; three things are
requisite unto this work. First, there must be a saw which is the Instrument.
Secondly, there must be one to pull Saw.
and move the saw, to apply it to the Tree; which is the Efficient cause,
Thirdly, there must be a certain oily and liquide matter to make the Saw
run; which is Causa adiuvans: the Helping cause: which smoothes the Saw and
makes it run with case: So it is in this great work of Repentance: the Saw
or Instrument to work, is the preaching of the Gospel, which does saw and
work upon the conscience, as the Instrument of God: and God himself is the
effectual puller or workman to work Repentance in us. So that

Now the Helping Causes are especially three;

1. The Mercy of God. 2. The Judgments of God. 3. Our own Considerations.
Mercies of God and the remembrance of them, for when God puts us in mind what
he has done for us, or we our selves consider, what we have lost or
hazarded, by reason of our sins, who cannot but relent and acknowledge the
same? considering of Gods goodness: as it is Romans 2. Romans 2.
What do thou not know O man! that the bountifulness of God and his
goodness leads thee to Repentance: for look how many mercies God does
bestow upon us, so many strong motives they are unto Repentance: So Ierem.
Ierem. 2.
2. God showing his former kindnesses unto them, expostulateth the matter to
bring them unto Repentance and Confession, Ezekiel. 20. 43. the Lord shows for
the Ezekiel. 20. 43.
other, And there shall you remember your ways and all your doings wherein you
have been defiled, and yet shall Ioathe your selves in your own fight, etc.
and Job. Job. 35. 10.
35. 10. he complains, that none remembered the mercies of God, and therefore
they were not heard in their prayers, because they wanted faith to repent. To
urge the point yet more, that the mercies of God, move much to Repentance, see
Luke 5. when Peter saw the great Luke 5.
draught of fishes, Lord (says he) depart from me a sinful man: Thus Gods
mercies did bring Peter to the acknowledgement of his sins. Even so the
mercies of God should bring us to make this use of it, to bring us to the
consideration of our sins and to repent for them, and to love the Lord for
his goodness, and for his mercy and favor bestowed upon us. If a wicked wife
should Wife.
slip away from her husband, and commit many faults against him; If he not
withstanding send her love tokens from time to time, this kindness of her
husband must needs be a mighty means to draw her back again in love and
obedience unto him. Even such is the kindness and goodness of God toward
us, that though we slip and slide from him by our sins, yet he sends to us
love tokens, his mercies and his blessings every day, from time to time to
bring us home by Repentance.

The second Helping or furthering Cause is: The Judgments of God, this is a
principal cause in furthering Genesis 42. 12.
of our Repentance: as we may see Genesis 42. 12. of Joseph's brethren when
they were in trouble, then they confessed their sins being accused: Nay, but
to see the Nakedness of the land you are come. So the Prodigal Luke 15. 18.
son when he was in misery, then he came home to his Father. So Isa. 26.
16. Lord in trouble have they visited Isa. 26. 16.
thee: they poured out a Prayer when thy Chastisement was upon them: so the
Lord does mightily convince them of sin: and neglecting his Judgments, I
hearkened Ier. 8. 6.
and heard, but they spoke not ar^ght, no man repented him of his wickedness,
saying, what have I done? every man turned to his course, as the horse rusheth
to the battle. and Zephan. 3. 5. he says, The just Lord is in the midst
thereof, he will not do iniquity, every morning Zeph 3. 5.
does he bring his Judgments to light, but the unjust knows no shame. So
Amos 4. the Lord there complains of this, that he sent his Judgments from
time to time, Amos 4.
he sent mildewes and blastings, and many other judgments, and yet he
complains, (Ye returned not unto A sheep.
me.) If a sheep go astray from his shepherd out of the flock, he will
set his dog at him as if he would kill him or worrie him, and yet he has
no purpose to hurt him, but to drive him home to the fould again, for when the
sheep is come home, he rates and calls off his dog. So the Lord does by us,
if we go astray and turn from his sheepe-fold, then he sets his dog at
us, as if he would kill us, the dog of poverty, or the dog of lamenesse,
or of blindness, or of sickness, or some cross or some other judgments,
and yet he has no purpose to hurt us, it is but only to bring us home unto
him; for if we be once brought home, he calls off his dog again, and
rates him, which is Gods end in all afflictions which he from time to time
sends.

The third helping or furthering Cause is, our own 3 Psalm. 119.
Considerations: as Psalm. 119. David says, I considered my ways, and turned
my feet to thy testimony,: So until we come to consider our own ways, we
can never turn unto God. Now this consideration must be in four things: Cor.
1. 5. For 2. Cor. 1. 5.
as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our Consolation also abounds
through Christ. angels for evermore.

The Necessity of Repentance, that is is such a necessary grace that we
cannot be saved without it, for there is but two ways, either to Repent or
else to perish, For if a man weresicke, and a Physician should come to A sick
man.
him and temper for him such a Potion, which if he did not take, he could not
choose but dye, one would think a man could not choose but take it, though it
were against his stomach: Even so we are all sick of the disease of sin,
and the Lord has tempered a Potion for us to drink, and he tells us, if
we do not take it, we shall not escape condemnation. Now this Potion, which
the Lord has tempered for us, is Repentance, therefore we must be contented
to take it though it be against our stomach.

Second consideration is, The utility and profit we have by it, for if we
repent God will forgive us, but if we repent not, God will make us answer for
it at the great day of Judgment: here is our choice, Repent and be forgiven,
Repent not and perish: so the Lord promises Forgiveness upon Repentance, Isa.
1. 18. Though Isa. 1. 18.
your sins wer^red as scarlet, he will make them white as snow, if you
repent and obey; that is, in Gods account it shall be so.

Third Consideration is: The readiness of God to receive us; then he will
turn his frowning anger into loving favor, his cursings into blessings, his
judgments into mercies; so soon as the Prodigal son came home to his
Father, we see how willing and how ready he was to receive him: So it is with
every sinner so soon as he returns home to God, the Lord is presently
ready to receive him, and to forgive all that is past.

Fourth is, That one day we shall dye, and know not how soon, when, if we
die without Repentance, we must be damned for ever. Therefore, this should
make us repent and turn unto God. I remember the meditation of a learned man:
says he; The estate of a sinner One in a journey.
is like a man traveling or going a journey, and as he went, he fell into a
pit full of snakes, toades and serp^nts, in the mouth of which pit there was a
tree, a bough whereof (as he fell) he caught hold of, and did hang thereby,
at the root whereof there was a lean and hunger-bitten beast, that every day
did gnaw to pull it down, which beast is death: which seeing one day it will
gnaw the root in pieces, it shows what need we had of Repentance.

LECT. V.
V. THE TIME OF Repentance.
HEB. 4. 7. To day if you will hear his voice, hardon not your hearts.
WE spoke the last day of the Causes of Repentance; First of the Efficient
Cause which is God. Secondly of the Isntrumental cause, which is the preaching
of the Word, or the Gospel. Thirdly of the Furthering or helping causes, which
(I said) was, The mercies of God, the Judgments of God, our own
considerations.

Now the next thing we are to speak of is, The Time of Repentance, for it is
in vain to know what we have to do, if we defer to do it in due time, or
take exception to the time, as you see the Jews did, when they were called
upon to build the Temple after their return from the captivity, Hag. 1. 2.
This people say the time is Hag. 1. 2.
not come, the time that the Lords house should be built: So for us to say,
the time is not yet come wherein we should repent: but if God took it ill,
that they should put off the building of a material house, what will he House.
say unto such as deny the building up of their souls to life everlasting? But
such is the depraved nature of man, that when we should seek God and reform
our selves, we take exception to the time, yea when we are pressed unto this
duty by a godly Minister, we are ready to cry out with the devils against
Christ, Math. 8. 29. Art Math. 8. 29.
thou come hither to torment us before our time? The reason of this delay is,
because, if we have serious and sad thoughts of repentance, we think and
conceive that we have true repentance indeed. But we must not so deceive our
selves to say, I have thought so, I had a purpose to repent, and do the duty,
etc. But to come to The time of Repentance, it may be considered,

1. Generally. 2. Particularly.
The General time of Repentance, is the Time of this life; for there is no
repenting when a man is dead. Therefore 1 In this life.
here are two rules in the General. First, that this whole life is the time of
Repentance. Secondly, that after death it is a work cannot be done. Therefore
let no man presume of further mercy then he is able to call for, which is in
the time of this life. All the Scripture is clear for this: as John 9. 4. I
must work the work of him that sent John. 9. 4.
me, while it is day, the night comes when no man can work. So Gal. 6. 20.
As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all, and Eccles. 9.
10. Whatsoever Gal. 6. 20. Eccles. 9. 10.
thy hand finds to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work or
device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave whither thou go; and this
we see that as the time of doing good is in this life, so is the time of
Repentance, and as we can do nothing being dead, no more can we repent being
dead. For this purpose Jeremy Ier. 13. 16.
reasons with the people, Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cause
darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains. And David
says, Psalm. 39. vlt. O spare me that I may recover strength, before Chrysostom.
on Ps. 19. vide.
I go hence and be no more: So then if we have any thing to do, do it with
all thy might; if thou have to repent, repent earnestly; if thou have to pray,
pray fervently: if thou have to hear, hear diligently: if thou have to give,
give cheerfully, for when thou art in the grave, all opportunity is gone, all
time is taken away. I remember a pretty meditation of a learned man, says he;
As long as a murderer is in the way to the Judgment seat, he may make
friends to compass the matter, but if the Judge have given sentence and he
be condemned, then he may look for the hangman, for the sword, and for the
halter, and for the dark dungeon. Even so as Murderer.
long as we are in the way to the Judgment, that is, as long as we are in
this life, we may labor to compass the matter, we may make friends with
God, but if once we be dead and the sentence have passed, we may look for
the devil and hell to seize upon us, and therefore (says he) my good
brethren, let not the time of your life pass without Repentance, for death
will come, and the judgment will come: therefore grieve and sorrow, mourn and
lament, whilst you have time and live here.

It is true indeed, that all the wicked in Hell shall repent every vein in
their hearts, when they shall see what styes and stables they have made of
their bodies, by their sins of Idolatry, Adultery, Drunkenness, Swearing
and profaneness, they shall mourn and lament, and wail for it: but they
shall have no benefit or profit thereby, for this bond of Repentance shall be
Afflictiue and Poenall, it shall be to their further increase of torment:
therefore if we would have comfort by Repentance, we must repent betimes in
this life, for it is better to sorrow and mourn here where we may have
comfort, then hereafter, when we can have none. In worldly business, either
planting, building, or purchasing, we make haste whilst we live to see all
things done betimes, and settled during our lives, nay, we think it will not
be so well done, as when we our selves ouersee it: And shall we not much
more regard the preparing and fitting of our selves for Heaven, which cannot
be done unless we faithfully repent in the time of this life so, as it was
commanded to Hezekiah, to settle his house in order, for Hezekiah.
he should die: so are we pressed to the duty of Repentance, before we die,
that in our life, our souls may be prepared for Heaven. Is it not then high
time for all wicked men to prepare themselves to Repentance in this life,
considering all hope is debarred them after death?

Now there be diverse Reasons why this is so that Repentance must not be put off.
Because the delaying and putting off of Repentance is dangerous.

Because the true time of Repentance is, to begin as soon as we can, and the
sooner the better, a man cannot begin to repent him too soon of his sins,
because he cannot leave and forsake his sins too soon, this is urged by the
wise man, Eccles. 12. 1. Remember Eccles. 12. 1.
thy Creator now in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor
the years draw nigh, when thou shall say, I have no pleasure in them, For then
we will be unfit, and many inconveniences depend upon decrepidnesse, for such
may be the distemper of the body, that the mind will have small rest, and
less list to make a sacrifice. Therefore begin as soon as may be in the
youth and strength of thy body, and as Abraham rose up early Abraham rising.
in the morning to sacrifice unto God, so rise thou up early, and begin betimes
to repent thee of thy sins: taking home the Apostles exhortation, Heb. 3. 13.
Whilst Heb. 3. 15.
it is called to day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, etc.
As a man that has a long journey to go will rise up early in the morning, and
prepare himself, so must we remember that we have a long Long journey.
journey to go when we go to Heaven, yea so long, as we shall never return
again, how had we need then to prepare our selves to Repentance, and begin
betimes, considering we cannot come thither without it. But more distinctly,

There be five maine Reasons to move us to speedy Repentance.
The first is, Because early Repentance is more certain 1 Reason to Repent
betimes.
and sure, then that which is deferred, for we know not if God will grant us
time, or not, to repent hereafter. We that are in the Church to day, may be in
our graves tomorrow; and though he do give us time, we know not whether he
will give us the means or grace to repent, and if he do give us the means,
we do not know whether he will bless the means unto us. Therefore it is
good for us to repent whilst it is to day, whilst it is offered us. This was it
which made Isaac resolve to bless his children betimes, Genes. 27. 3. Behold
Genesis 27. 3.]
now I am old, and know not the day of my death; so because we know not the
day of our death, how soon we shall leave the world, and lay down our heads
in the dust, it is good for us to begin betimes, and leave a blessing upon our
souls before we die. Augustine says Augustine.
well. he that promised to forgive thee if thou repent, did not promise thee
that thou should live till to morrow: It is true God has promised, that he
shall not die that does repent him of his sins, and that in many places of
Scripture. Now if we will consider how just God is in his promises, and
faithful in his performances, who would not repent; but remember withal that
these promises are reither made or auailable unto any, but unto such as Repent.

Secondly, Because early Repentance is more fruitful 2 Reason to Repent
betimes.
then late, for though late repentance may be true, yet commonly it is not so
fruitful, comfortable, nor accompanied with so many graces as that which is
early, the Thief upon the Cross, had late Repentance, and yet it Math.
was true and sufficient for the salvation of his soul, but it was not
accompanied with so many graces, nor brought that glory to God as it might
have done being more early. Again, Paul was converted, and repented betimes,
and we know how abundantly he was stored with graces, and Act. 9.
brought glory to God, and comfort to the people of God.

Uses.
Luke 15. what sweet passages are there for timely Luke 15.
repentances, and to personate a merciful God, by a wise and merciful Father,
let the world say what it can, and men judge as they list, he that supposes
himself most righteous must repent, as it is in Christ's inuectiue against the
too forward Jews, Luke 13. 5. Nay, but Luke 13. 5.
except ye Repent, ye shall alllikewise perish.

3 It is the more easy.
A third reason is, Because early Repentance is the more easy; For the longer
we go on and live in sin, the harder it will be to repent, if thou find
it hard to day, it will be harder to morrow, and if it be hard this week, it
will be more difficult the next, and if it be hard this year, it will be
much more difficult the next: Therefore God makes no limitation, but says
plainly, Heb. 3. 13. To day, lest any of you be hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin, and ver. 15. To day if you will hear his voice, then
harden not your hearts, etc. I remember the saying of a learned man, if
presently after a great rain it be hard to get over a river, then it will be
High River.
much harder at noone, and worse at night, when all the streams are come into
one course and current. Even so, if it be hard to repent presently after a
sin committed; It will be harder when one has committed twenty sins, much
more when he has committed thousands of sins, when all the sins of his life
come to one course or current, therefore timely repentance is the easier.

4 Late Repentance attended with the more sowrenesse.
The fourth is, Because the longer we ly in our sins unrepented of, the more
sour and harsh they will be: For the measure of our Repentance must in some
sort be proportionable unto the measure of our sins; If our sins be great,
our repentance must also be great; and if our sins be small, our repentance
may be the lesser; for the more sins be committed, the more sorrow, grief
and tears, there must be in our repentance for them, as we see in nature, the
stronger the sickness is, so much Sickness.
the stronger must the physic be. The Jews did temper for Christ a bitter
Cup to drink, but by our sins Bitter Cup.
we have tempered a cup for our selves to drink: for every sin we commit,
is as a drop of poison to make this cup so much the more bitter unto us, we
see by experience, that if a man break a leg or an arm, the Leg broken
longer it remains unset, the worse it is to be joined, so the longer we
live without Repentance, the worse it will be to repent: therefore the best is
to ^rie unto God betimes: When our heart is overwhelmed. As in diseases Psalm.
139. Physic.
the physic is always tempered to the st^ength of the diseased, but the
longer it is deferred, the more dangerous is the cure: So it is with us for our
sins, we must have the Physic of Repentance cure us, according to the
measure of our sins, as I have showed. If a man have made himself a great
burden to carry, and should Great Burden.
assay it on his back, and so he finds it uneasy, and to press him very
much, if he should then throw it down and put a great deal more unto it, and
then begin to lift it again, but upon the second trial finding it heavier
then before, if he should fall in a great rage, till he add twice as much
strength and labor to carry it the lighter; would we not think such a one
foolish, thus wilfully to increase his burden? so is it with the children of
this world; because they find Repentance somewhat uneasy at first, they cast
it from them, and by that time they come again (having added more sins, and
made their burden heavier) they are compelled to their greater sorrow and
greater Repentance, to wrestle with so grievous a burden, at a wondrous great
disadvantage.

5 It is more pleasing.
The Fifth Reason why early Repentan^ is better then late, is: Because it is
more pleasing unto God: for he for the most part reckons more of an old
disciple then of a new. As we see in experience, usually one will make more
account of an old servant then of a new, he will Old seruent.
commit more trust to him, and be more familiar with him. Even so the Lord
makes more reckoning of an old Disciple, then of a new, wherefore by all these
reasons we may see, that early Repentance is better then late. And therefore
now let us do as it is said, 1. Chron. 22. 16. 1. Chron. 22 16
Arise therefore and be doing, the Lord will be with thee: So seeing we have
so many sins to repent us of, and that God must have the temple of our souls
new built, and re-edified; let us up betimes, and be doing with our Repentance.
As Pro. 3. 28. Say not unto thy neighbor Pro. 3. 28.
go and come again tomorrow: but give when thou have it by thee; So say not
unto God, when he offers thee Repentance, go and come again; I will listen to
this another time, but listen while it is time, and refuse not mercy when it
is so near thee. We see that in the practice of men, they cannot endure to
be put off from day to day Putting off.
in those things they desire to have, but they will take it as an injury done
unto them: So the Lord takes it as a great i^iurie and wrong done unto him,
when men put off their repentance from day to day.

The common course of the world is to defer Repentance unto the day of death,
thinking that to be the fittest time for it: But such are deceived, for of all
other times this is the worst for it, and that because of two impediments:

1. One in Nature. 2. The other in Grace.
1 Impediment at the hour of death.
The first impediment in Nature is, The Dolor and pain wherein the party at
that time is, for when pains be upon a man, how unfit is he then to repent,
when it is tedious and irksome to speak or hear any noise; O how unfit is a
man then to set all his sins in order before him, to sorrow and mourn for
them, and that he has offended, by them, so gracious and good a God? In this
case, it befalls unto many at such times, as it did with the Israelites, Exodus
6. 9. Moses told them, that the Israelites. Exodus 6. 9.
Lord would bring them out of Egypt, that he would take away the burdens from
their shoulders, and that he would bring them into the land of Canaan, which
he had sworn unto their Fathers, to give unto them: But the text shows, That
they did not hearken unto Moses, for the anguish of spirit, and because of the
cruel bondage they were in. So for the most part when pains and sickness are
upon one, he is not fit, to listen unto any good counsel or admonition, that
any one can bring him be it never so comfortable unto others; therefore the
time of death, is a most unfit time for the beginning of Repentance.

2 Impediment at the hour of Death.
Secondly, Because the time of death to a natural man (until he has
repented) is of all other times the most terrible and fearful: Until he have
obtained the assurance of the forgiveness of sins, and that heaven and
happiness belongs unto him. If a Physician should come Physician.
to take away a leg or an arm from a man, what a fearful thing would it
be? how much more fearful to a natural man is death, which comes not to
take away a leg or an arm only, but to rent body and soul asunder, to be
at last tormented for ever? So that when death comes with so doleful an errand
to separate two old friends, this time must needs be a most undisposed season
to repent in.

3 Impediment at death.
Thirdly, Because of worldly Cogitations, as the disposing of wife and children,
house and lands, and other goods, all these must needs hinder the motions of
Repentance. A Candle.
As if a man have a candle lighted in a Mine under the earth, if it be near or
under a dampe, this will come, and put out the candle; So when in the time of
sickness there is a candle lighted of good motions and meditations of
Repentance: then these new mutinous cogitations enter in, to think what shall
become of wife and children, this and that friend, and how to bestow our goods:
these like a dampe extinguish the good thoughts of Repentance.

4 Impediment in our death. Pro. (...).
The fourth is, That God then ordinarily punishes our neglect of this duty in
our health, with hardness of heart on our deathbeds: As it is Pro. 1. Because
he called then to us, and we would not answer: therefore we call unto him,
and he will not answer us, even when our fears come like a whirlewinde, and
our desolation posteth upon us. O says Christ to Jerusalem; Would to God thou
Math. 23. vlt.
had known in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace; but now
they are hid from thine eyes: Work (says our Savior to the Jews) whilst it
is called to day, John 8.
for the night comes in which no man can work: So that this night time of
sickness, is of all times the most unfit to repent in; when God may justly
leave us comfortless, because we would not ere that time hearken to the words
of instruction, and walk in new obedience.

2 The Impediments of Grace
Impediments in Grace.
At that time may be these; God may deny us the means to work Faith and
Repentance in us; our comforters and helpers then shall be silent, tongue tied
or absent, when we most wish, desire, and languish for comfort and help: then
one of a thousand may be denied us.

Though he do give us means, yet it may be he will not bless them, or
make them powerful and effectual unto us. And though he do bless the
means, yet our comfort shall then be the lesser, for ordinarily he does more
bless the public, then the private means unto us: wherefore of all times,
the time of death is the most unable for Repentance, and the worst, wherefore
now O ye my hearers! let my counsel this day be acceptable in your eyes and
ears: Remember now your Eccles. 12. 1.
Creator in the days of your youth, health and strength: the sooner it is
done, the better, easier, and more comfortable will your life and death be:
do therefore in this, as Abraham did when he sacrificed Isaac, he rose Genes.
Abraham.
up early in the morning; so we should rise up early in the morning of our age
and youth ^o offer up our selves, our souls and bodies unto God, as a living
sacrifice: our Isaac must at one time or other be sacrificed: therefore let us
repent, and bewail our sins betimes: for it is a special point of prudence,
to do that betimes which must needs be done. Thus of the General.

Now for the Particular Time of Repentance, there be six things Considerable.
When a man has committed any new sin, then is a special time for him to
renew his Repentance, as he has renewed his sin. So David did, 2. Sam. 24.
2, Sam. 24. 10.
10. where it is recorded, that David's heart smote him after that he had
numbered the People. Thus by and by he renewed his Repentance, after that he
had confessed and seen his sin. So Peter, Math. 26. 73. It is written of
him, that after he had remembered the words of Christ, He went out and wept
bitterly. Thus every new act of Math. 26 73.
sin must have a new act of Repentance, as I have said. If a man have an arm
or a leg out of joint, he can never Arm out of joint.
be quiet until it be set and put in order again; so should it be in our
committing of sin: for because every sin sets the soul out of joint,
we should never be quiet until Repentance have put all in frame again. We
see by experience, that if a candle be blown Candle.
out, if a man by and by run to the fi^e with it, the sooner he comes, the
easier it will be lighted again and the sooner: and the longer he ^arries,
the longer it will be ere it take fire; even so when a man falls into any
sin, the sooner he repents of it, the more easy and better it will be for
him, and the longer he deferres his Repentance, the harder it will before him
to bring his heart to the duty. Therefore it will be best for us, to take the
best courses which may bring us unto salvation, no sooner to have sinned, but
presently thereupon also to renew our Repentance: As the wise man's counsel is,
My son if Prou.
thou have sinned, defer not thy Repentance.

When any judgment of God, either public or private falls upon us; as the
Prophet shows, Isa. 26. 16. Lord in trouble have Isa 26 16.
they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.
So Lament. 3. 40. says the Church, Lam 3 40.
Let us search and try our ways, and turn unto the Lord. When God sends
sickness, blindness, or lamenesse, loss in our goods friends, reputation,
preferment, or such like, then is a special tune to repent us of our sins.
For it is a sure thing that the judgments of God come by reason of our sins,
and so questionless God will renew his judgments, if we renew our sins;
which cannot be removed but by Repentance. If a man's house be on House on fire.
fire, he will carry out his Flax and Towe, Wood and Straw, with every thing
else which is fit and likely to augment the fire: and then does he cry for
help and pour on water to quench it; even so because our sins do nourish
the fire of Gods wrath, and will consume our souls, if we do not carry them
out of sight by repentance, therefore we should set about this work: and take
away all that matter which may increase the fire of Gods vengeance upon us:
which is to put away our sins by repentance; as we see Deuteronomy. 9. 20. Moses
did, for thus Deuteronomy. 9. 20.
he records it; And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him:
and I prayed for Aaron the same time. Here you see how a judgment was removed
by Aarons repentance, and Moses prayer. We see if the Kings Writs be out
against a man to attach him, Bailiffs and Sherifes lying in wait for him in
every corner to arrest him: such a man will presently labor to compass the
matter, and bring it to agreement for fear of imprisonment: So when the Writs
of God are out against us, Kings Writs.
and his Judgments like Sergeants and Baylifes dog us in every corner: what
should we do in this case? but labor to compass the matter betimes to be
wiser for our souls and immortality, then they are for a little temporal
punishment in this life: and to make a good use of Gods judgments upon others:
the omission whereof, made the Spirit of God complain thus, Revel. 9. 20. And
Revel. 9. 20.
the remnant of the people which were not killed by these plagues, repented not
of the works of their hands, where the Lord complains of them, that they had
no regard to his judgments. So Amos 4. 6. And I also have given Amos 4. 6.
you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your
places, yet have ye not returned unto me, says the Lord. The like we have,
Ier. 5. 3. Thou have stricken Ier. 5. 3.
them, but they have not grieved, thou have consumed them, but they have
refused to receive correction, etc. So that by these places you see, it is a
special time for us to call upon God when his hand is upon us, and we see
apparently, that our sins do pull his judgments nearer and nearer us.

When God affoords us any special means, then he looks for special actions
and affections, in turning toward him: as at the coming of John Baptist,
Math. 3. 10. And now also the axe is laid unto the root Math. 3. 10.
of the tree: before the axe of God was laid to the boughs and branches, but
now to the very root, at which time there is no remedy, but that Every tree
which brings not forth good fruit, must be hewn down and cast into the fire.
So it is said, Act. 17. 30. And the times of Act. 17. 30.
this ignorance God winked at, but now he commands all men every where to
repent; So that when God sends special means, this is a special time of
Repentance. Ships Ships.
that have lain long in the harbor, yet as soon as the wind blows, by and
by they set forward to their intended journey, as it is said, Act. 27. 13. And
when the southwinde Act. 27. 13.
blew softly (supposing that they had obtained their purpose) they loosed
thence. Even so should we do, when we have lain long in the harbor of sin,
done little good in Religion, or to the Church of God, yet when the wind
blows, when God offers gracious and good means, when we have so fair an
opportunity, we should lay hold upon the good things that be for our
salvation. So that this must needs be a fearful abuse of Gods kindness and
goodness; that when it is a special time of Repentance: through our
corruptions we make it a special time of wantonness and uncleanness, and
we are so far from being the better for all our special means, that we
become worse and worse: and so bring judgment upon us. Our Savior Christ
Math. 11. does vpbraid Math. 11.
those Cities wherein he had done most of his great works, because for all
this they had not repented them of their sins, where he tells them That it
shall be easier for Sodom and for Gomorrah in the day of Judgment, then for
them: So if we do not profit by the preaching of the Word, and the good
means which are amongst us at this day: the estate of Sodom and Gommorrah at
that great day, shall be easier and better then ours. So let us take heed it be
not so with us, for what a fearful sign of damnation is this? when we thus
set open the gates of hell, by being no more careful to come to Faith and
Repentance, and other saving graces, in the midst of such abundance of means?

when we go about any great work: For many times in our honest labors,
there are many crosses and troubles which do befall us, because we have not
repented. Therefore it must be our wisdom, when we go about any great
work which we would have to prosper, then to repent, lest we encounter with
great crosses. So Ezra 8. 21. he Ezra 8. 21. Esth. 4. 16. 2. Chron. 20. 12
Iesh. 7. 11. 12.
practiced: So Esther 4. 16. So Iehoshaphat, 2. Chron. 20. 12. The omission of
this duty you see was dangerous, Josh. 7. 11. 12. they could not stand before
their enemies, says God unto Joshua, Up, Israel has sinned, and they have
transgressed my Covenant, therefore the children of Israel could not stand
before their enemies: Even so it is with us, we cannot stand before our
enemies, God does not bless our labors, endeavors, nor any thing we take in
hand, because we do not prepare our selves unto Repentance, therefore (as I
said) when we have a great work in hand, it is a special time of Repentance,
and herein we must imitate the servants of God in their examples, when Ezra
had a great journey to go: first he fasted and prayed: so many other of the
Saints forenamed: this was their practice, and so must it be ours, chiefly
when we come to hear the Word, or receive the Sacran ^nts, then we must be
sure to have repenced soundly for our (...) nes, or else, as we cannot expect
mercy: so we depart away without comfort. As a man that would draw a river
into his River drawn.
ground, he must first prepare the channel, cut down the banks, and stop the
passages; so must men do with their sins, that would have the river of Gods
mercy to run through their hearts.

Eeuery morning when we arise, and every night when we go to bed: For as we
sin daily, so must we daily renew our repentance, let us then repent every
morning before we rise. The steward who has but a short memory, will be

casting up his accounts and reckoning with his Master, he will never let them
tarry too long without clearing and making even, so because that our memory is
short, and that we soon forget our sins, we should desire to have often
reckoning with the Lord every day to make even with him. I^ we would thus often
do, we should have but a few sins to repent us of when we come to die. We
see by experience, if a man have a little Brook that runs through his
ground, as long as he keeps the channel little Brook.
clean that the waters may still avoid, it will never annoy him, but if he
suffer the gutters to be stopped with mudde and dirt, and weeds to stop the
course and carrying of the water, by and by it will ouerflow his ground. And
even so, though a man have some sins which annoy and trouble him, yet (...)
he will be daily cleansing the channel of his heart, and make the channel
open by Repentance, there will be the less danger to his soul, as we see it
was said of David's practice, Psalm. 6. He talks Psalm. 6.
of a vexed soul, wearisomenesse with groaning, making his bed to swim with
tears, consuming of his eyes, and the like: so must our Repentance come with
sighs, groans, weeping and wringing of the heart (if it were possible) that
so we be the better assured, that it is unfeigned and rightly bred; and that it
is such unto which God will have respect.

journey, when he is ready to put forth into the sea, then he especially
looks, that all his Masts, Sails, Anchors, and Tacklings be ready, fit and
prepared; so howsoever a man deal with his Faith, Repentance, and other graces
all his life time, yet now when at the hour of death, he comes to lance forth
into so rough a Sea, for his last journey; he must then look all over again,
and see that nothing be wanting, but that his faith, prayers, penetencie, love,
and such like, be in a readiness for to conduct him in peace and safety unto
the end of his last journey. But commonly men do by Repentance, as great men
do by Banquets, when a great Feast comes: they sit and gaze Banquets.
and admire, but their stomachs are gone; many in this case have no stomachs to
eat: So many men look at these excellent things of God, admire them, but will
not eat: will not repent, leave their sins, etc. But let us in the Name of
God who know better things, and have not thus learned Christ, go on, resolve,
labor and practice Repentance, ere it be too late: which now is our next
Point to be handled the next time.

LECT. VI.
VI. THE PRACTICE OF Repentance.
JOEL. 2. 12. Therefore, also now (says the Lord,) Turn ye even to me with
all your heart, and with fasting and with weeping, and with mourning;

And rent your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God;
for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and
repents him of the evil.


WE spoke the last day of the Time of Repentance, when we showed, that for
every new sin, there must be a new act of Repentance, and so as we sin
daily, we must daily repent. For (as I then showed) if a man have a little
Brook which runs through his ground, as long as he keeps the channel clean,
pulls up the weeds, and dirt, and sand from stopping it up, he is sure it will
not annoy him, nor ouerflowe his banks: So as long as a man does daily renew
his repentance, and pull up the weeds of his sins from his heart, he shall
be sure that the river of Gods mercy will run smoothly and currently into his
soul, thus then you see Repentance is a daily duty, and only in the time of
this life to be performed: as we commit daily sins, so had we need of daily
Repentance.

Now the next point we are to speak of, is of The Practice of Repentance, or
manner how we must Repent, for it may be some men will be ready to except
and say, seeing Repentance is such a necessary duty, as no man living can be
saved without it, and seeing the time of this life is nothing else, but a time
left of God to Repent; and so I am willing to perform this great work, but
alas, I know not how, nor in what manner I should repent: so that as the
Disciples said unto Christ, Luke 11. 1. Lord teach us to pray, so may we say,
Lord teach us to repent, we be willing to repent, but know not how nor in what
manner.

Wherefore we are to know that in the practice of Repentance, there must be
four several things, that is, in the presenting of our selves before the
Throne of Gods Majesty, and attempting or performing this our duty of
Repentance; for the acquisition of our salvation, there must be,

1. Examination, 2. Humiliation, 3. Deprecation, 4. Resolution,
Which be the four things required in the Practice of Repentance.

1 Examination.
First, there must be Examination, for every one that will repent, must first
examine himself in the matter of Repentance, how to find out his own sins
and offenses, for how can a man repent him of his sins, if he do not know
them I so he that ^d repent, must first labor to come to the knowledge of his
sins, and he cannot know his sins, but by examining his heart, and his own
ways, that he may find out his own strayings and wanderings from the Lord, by
the righteous rule of the Law of God, the word of God must be the candle to
light the mind, and to direct and show what is good and what is bad, what is
sin, and what is not sin, what is pleasing unto God, and what is displeasing
unto him. As may be seen, Lament. 3. 40. says the Church there; Let us Lam.
3. 40.
search and try our ways, and turn again unto the Lord. Meaning that
unless we will seek and search into our own hearts to find out the things
that are amiss; and so seek and search, as a man looking diligently for a
thing lost, who lights a candle and searches every corner, Thing lost.
till he has found the thing, we shall never be able to find out all our
sins: So the Prophet says, Psalm. 119. Psalm, 119. 59.
59. I considered my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. Seeing then
it was the consideration of his own ways, which made him turn into the ways
of God, let us practice the same. The like we have in the story of the
Prodigal son, Luke 13. 19. And when he Luke 13. 9.
came to himself, he said, I will return to my father, etc. When he had
examined his own state and condition, then it came into his mind to return
unto his Father: so then the Point is, That in the Practice of Repentance there
must be examination of our own ways, which is a thing contrary to the course
of the world, who are prone to look into other men's ways and neglect their
own. The beasts Revel: 4. 8. were full of eyes within, but the most men have
eyes without to look into other men's secrets, but not into their own faults
at home: such men may be likened unto husbands, who because they have unquiet
wives at home, love as much as may be Ill wife.
to be abroad, because they can no sooner put their heads within the doors,
but by and by their wives are upon them, even so it is with him that has a bad
conscience, as with him that has a bad wife, no sooner he can come home into
himself, but by and by his conscience is upon him, ready to rail at him and
rebuke him for his sins, so that he longs as much as may be to be abroad, and
to deal with other men's sins, rather then his own. But Paul tells us 1.
Cor. 11. 31. That we must judge our 1, Cor. 11. 31.
selves, if we would have God not to judge us. Therefore every Christian man
should set up a Tribunal and Judgment seat in his owneheart, and make a
solemn arraignement of himself, that is to say, that he so set himself
before God, that he first undertake the trial of his own ways, and consider
wherein he has offended, and what sins he has committed against him, then
he must bring the bills of indictment against himself, make a presentment of
his own faults, where he has sinned, when offended, and how displeased so
good a God. And thus every man must judge himself, that God do not judge him:
for a judgment must come. St. Austen says well, That so often as a man
remembers his sins, God forgets them. If thou examine thy self, God will
urge no further; if thou judge and condemn thy self, God will not judge thee;
if thou punish thy self, God will spare thee. So then this is the first Point,
we must examine our selves how we have offended. Now in this examination
there are two things required:

1. There must be a right Rule to examine by, 2. There be certain Heads, upon
which we must examine.
1 False Rule.
First, for the Rule, There are certain false Rules which we must remember
never to take hold of. First, That a man do not examine himself by himself,
for a man may be in a better case then formerly, and yet in no good estate: he
may have left gross sins, particular sins, and yet be deceived infinitely
short of true goodness: So that a man is but a falfe rule unto himself, when
he will think all to be well, because he finds some better times then he was
wont. To this effect St. Paul says, 2. Cor. 10. 12. Wherefore let him who
thinks he stands, take heed lest 2. Cor. 10. 11.
he fall. And again, 2. Cor. 11. 12. he condemns this 2. Cor. 11. 12.
rule, saying: We are not of that number who compare themselves with
themselves.

2 False Rule.
The second false Rule is, when a man will examine himself by others: because
he sees others subject to more gross sins, or live openly more licentiously
then himself: As the Pharisee, Luke 18. 11. deceived himself. Luk 18. 11.
Lord I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,
adulterers, or even as this Publicane; you see he was better then a number of
others, no extortioner, adulterer, oppressor, unjust dealer, and yet he could
not be justified of the Lord: all this could not excuse him: so you see this is
but a false Rule to examine by, we should rather do as the Apostle commands,
Gal. 6. 4. Let every man prove his own work, etc. and then he shall have
rejoicing in himself, not in another.

3 False Rule.
A third false Rule is, When a man will examine himself by the speech of
people; and the account that the world makes of him. But we may be in much
account with others, accounted a good Christian, and a good liver, and yet all
this be but as a shadow before God: and therefore the Apostle says, Romans 14.
4. Every man must Romans 14. 4.
stand or fall unto his own Master: for God is able to make him stand. And 2.
Cor. 10. 18. he shows: no commendation 2. Cor. 10. 18.
ought to be built upon, unless it be of God; For not he who commends
himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends. Wheresore even as it was
said of Belteshazzar, Dan. 3. Thou art weighed in the Belteshazzar. Dan. 3.
balance and found light; so if we measure our selves by this Rule, we shall
be found too light in Gods balance. The true rule is a righteous Rule,
therefore we must examine our selves by the Law of God every one who would have
a true trial of himself: and then as the Carpenter Carpenter.
when he has applied his thread and line unto the timber, by and by he sees
where it was crooked. So when a man has thus applied himself unto the Law of
God, he soon shall see wherein he has been sinful and faulty. So this
Rule God gives unto his people, Deuteronomy. 30. 2. Obey his voice, according unto all
that is commanded thee.

Now for the heads which we must examine all our sins by, they be,

1. Inward. 2. Outward.
And God is the Judge of all, that is, we must examine our selves of all our
sins committed against God, and against our Brethren. There is a corruption
in nature in the examining of our sins, we deal by our selves as a false
Judge does by an offender: examine him so slightly, False Judge.
that one may see he would willingly save him: or that he is afraid to find
him faulty: even so in the examining of our selves at the best, we look but
at our outward sins, being loath to search into the inward secrets of our
souls, to find out the poison and corruption of our hearts, for from the
heart comes all manner of wickednesses: so that the true examination must be
of all our sins, so far forth as by any means we can come to the
knowledge of them: both of sins against the first and second Table, secret or
open what kind soever they be. Trads-men you know (especially in great Cities)
Tradsmen.
use to keep a book of all their expenses, of their layings out and commings
in, and so are often casting up their accounts to see whether they gain or
lose in matters of the world, so we should take an account of all our actions,
and keep a register of them; every night we should cast over our accounts, to
see how we have sinned and offended God, and how often, how we have repented:
if we find things to be well; we should bless God for it, and if we find
things to be amiss, we should be humbled in our souls for it: thus we must
labor to view all our actions: as we see God did, Genesis 1. when God had Genesis 1.
made an end of his first days work, and so of the rest, it is said; He
beheld the same, and lo all that he had made was very good. So should we from
day to day take a view of our works, speeches, and the like, to see whether
they have been good or bad.

2 Humiliation.
The second thing in the Practice of Repentance is Humiliation: for when a man
has seen that he is a sinner and lies in sin, this is not enough, but then
great care must be had also to be humbled for them; that is, bitterly to weep
and mourn for them, even to the shedding of many tears if it be possible: So
Peter did, Math. Math. 26 75.
26. 75. it is said, And he went out and wept bitterly, etc. So Mary Magdalen,
Luke 7. 38. it is said; And she Luke 7. 38.
stood behind him weeping, and began towash his feet with tears, and then to
wipe them with the hairs of her head. So David Psalm. 6. 6. confesses of
himself, All the night I Psalm. 6. 6.
make my bed swim, I water my couch with my tears. So we see it is a plain
case, when once we have seen our sins, the next thing to be done is, to be
humbled for them, as I have said even to the shedding of tears, which in Gods
sight are so precious and acceptable, that he gathers and puts them up in his
bottle, as Psalm. 56. 8. Thou Psa. 56. 3.
tellest my wanderings, put thou my tears into thy bottle; all other tears
fall to the ground, and are to little purpose, but every tear that a man sheds
for sin, that he has offended God: he gathers these up. But alas, what
shall I say? I doubt me not one of a 1000. of us let tears fall in this kind,
and for this cause you go mourning and want comfort, because you seek it not
the right way in godly sorrow first to be humbled, and then to rejoice. It is a
lamentable thing that many of you be twenty, thirty, and forty years old,
and yet you have never shed one tear for sin: O what a lamentable case is
this? that Christ may now come and say to you as he did unto those women, Luke
23. 28. O daughters of Jerusalem, Luke 23. 28.
weep not for me, but weep for your selves, etc. It is a good thing to weep
for Christ in regard of the pains and troubles which he suffered, and did
befall unto him as our surety; but it is a greater grace to weep for sin,
and that thereby we have displeased so good a God. Which (I take it) made St.
Augustine say, that Mary Magdalen brought two things to Christ, her ointment
and her tears, and yet her tears exceeded her ointment in sweetness, etc.

Now this sorrow for sin does require five qualifications: (Dolor Cordis, or
Contritionis,) the sorrow of the heart or Contrition: as Act. 2. Act. 2 37.
37. it is said those three thousand who heard Peter; were pricked in their
hearts: and Psalm. 51. A contrite and a Psalm. 51.
broken heart, O God thou will not despise. So that this sorrow must not be
outward only with the sadness of the face, but it must be a sorrow of the
heart, as Psalm. 63. the Prophet complains, my soul is vexed within me, etc.
It is called other-where the pouring out of the heart; for this is most
certain, when the soul in good earnest sets to wrestle for heaven, then there
is no time for us to dissemble with God.

Dolor secundum Deum, Godly sorrow which is a sorrow for sin, because it
displeases and has offended God, as we may read, 2. Cor. 7. 11. 2. Cor. 7.
11.
For behold this selfsame thing that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what
carfulness it wrought in you, etc. Many a man is sorry for his sin, and
peradventure repents not for all this, or if he do repent, it is not because
it is sin, but because it will bring their shame, loss, or discredit with
men, or that Gods judgments are ready to seize upon him: as Ahab when it was
told him that 2. King.
the dogs should lick his blood in that place where he had stoned Naboth,
he wept and humbled himself, and went softly, but it was not because he had
displeased God, but in regard of the judgment that should befall him. So Judas
was sorry for his sin, not because of sin but by Math.
reason it was so horrible a thing to betray his Master: this was it which made
so horrible and incureable a rent in his conscience: others again sorrow for
sin in an other kind, because they would be well accounted of, by the best
men and women: they would seem to be religious: because this is a fair way to
preferment and profit: when yet none of all this is godly sorrow: for this
cries always with holy David, and laments most sins against God: Against thee,
against thee only have I sinned and Psalm. 51.
done evil in thy sight, that thou may be just in thy judgments, etc.

Dolor particularis: a man must be sorrowful for his sins in particular,
whereby he has offended God. It is not enough for a man to be sorrowful
generally because he is a sinner, but he must draw himself to more
particulars, to an account, in what manner, and with what sins he has
displeased God, Her^, heri, hodie, hodie, yesterday, yesterday; to day to day:
because as one says well; Dolosus versatur in generalibus, a deceiuer loves
generals: therefore let us know, the duty consists in particulars, and we must
come (so far as it is possible) unto the account of every day, yea, every
hours sin, and be so sorry for them. Thus the people confessed, 2. Sam. 12.
19. For we have added unto all our 2. Sam. 12. 19. Judge. 10. 10.
sins this evil, to ask for us a King, etc. So Judge. 10. 10. they say, We
have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God; and served
Baalim. Now as concerning particular sorrow, we must do as Physicians do
Physicians.
with diseased bodies, when they find a general distemperature in the body,
they labor by all the art they can to draw the humor to another place, and
then they break it, and bring out all the corruption that way: All which is
done for the case of the patient. Even so we must do when we have a general
and confused sorrow for our sins; labor as much as may be to draw them unto
particulars: as to say, in this, and in this, and at such and such a time, in
such an occasion, and in such a place I have sinned against my God.

Dolor Reprehensivus, a reprehensiue sorrow, which is such a sorrow, that
though it begin but in a few particulars, yet at length Train of gunpowder.
it draws in all with it: even as a train of gunpowder, when one corn is
set on fire, it will not leave until all be fired and in a blaze, so true
sorrow though it begin but with one or a few sins: yet it draws in all the
rest ere long, for which we have not sorrowed. So David we see had no rest by
reason of one sin, Psalm. 51. but at last it Psalm. 51.
was not long ere it came into many heads, and set him aworke to complain of
more; yea, even to look back to his original corruption: even so we must
not think it enough to repent of one special or particular sin, and so
cease; but our sorrow must extend it self unto all: we must gather in with our
particular sins: which shows the great defect which for the most part is in
the Repentance commonly used in the world: If they repent of one sin, they
think it is enough and rest in that: So Judas did make a show of Repentance
for one offense: Math.
and so many other do; yea, and with tears: who yet miss of repentance,
because they never descend to search and try their selves in particulars: for
true sorrow so begins, as it at length draws in all.

Dolor Proportionalis: that is, if our sins be great, our sorrow for sin
must be so much the greater: If sins be few and little, our sorrow may be the
less, and sooner attain peace of conscience: Therefore this must needs be a
great corruption and selfe-deceite in the ordinary repentance of the world:
that what kind of sin so ever they commit, there is but one measure of
sorrow for it. We may see of Manasses, his sin was great, and his contrition
was great, it is said, That Mannasseth was humbled 2. Chron. 32. Math.
greatly; So Peter in denying his Master, it was a great sin, and therefore
his sorrow was proportionable; it is said, Then Peter went out and wept
bitterly: So Hezek^h 2. Chron.
committed a great sin in showing his treasure, and he was brought very low
for it. So if we have sinned greatly, it is certain our sorrow must be
proportionable, as we see by experience, he who falls into the midst of
River fallen in.
a river, must labor and take more pains to get out, then he who slippeth in
but at the brinke of it; even so if we fall into great sins, it must and
will cost us more sorrow and tears, then if we fall into lesser sins only.

3 Maine thing.
The Third maine thing I showed in the practice of Repentance, is Deprecation:
which is, a sending up of earnest and hearty petitions and requests unto God
for the pardon of sins, when once he has seen himself to be a wretched
and a grievous sinner: then to beg humbly at the Throne of grace for Jesus
Christ's sake to have them all pardoned and done away: In sum to have good
things given, and all evils they deserve removed: this is Deprecation. Holy
David was exceeding frequent in this duty in many Psalms; as Psalm. 51. Blot
Psalm. 51.
out all my offenses, and wash me from my sins: So the Publican, Luke 18. O
Lord be merciful to me a sinner: Luk 18.
Thus in this case we must not rest like Judas upon a bitter, Judas.
sour and heavy remembrance of our sin only, but become humble suitors to
the Throne of Grace for mercy, according to David's experience. Psalm. 32. 6.
For Psa. 32. 6.
this shall every one that is godly, make his prayer unto thee in an acceptable
time, etc. For what means he they should pray unto God for? for houses or
lands, or gold, or silver; no, for no other thing, especially, then the
forgiveness of sins: So in this case a man must behave himself, as a poor
prisoner at the bar, when the Judge Prisoner.
stands up ready to give sentence upon him, he falls down upon his knees, and
lifts up his hands, looks rufully, speaks pitifully, and begges for his life.
He cannot miss to speed at Gods hand, as Daniel did, Dan. 9. 20. even so, Dan.
9. 20.
if a sinner can pierce the heavens with his cries, and solicit God earnestly,
no question, he shall at length hear the voice of Christ say unto him by his
Spirit; Go in peace, thy sins are forgiven thee.

Practice of Repentance is. Resolution, to walk with God in newness of life,
as David did, Psalm. 119. I have sworn and will perform Psalm. 119. Psalm. 29. 1.
to keep thy righteous law: and Psalm. 39. 1. I said I will take heed to my
ways that I offend not with my tongue. And again, Psalm. 119. I considered my
ways, and turned Psalm. 119.
my feet unto thy Testimonies. I made haste and delayed not; the time is now;
not deferring till hereafter, now we must resolve to leave our sins, to
walk with God with newness of life, and with all watchfulness over our own
hearts: then unto resolution we must join a holy, constant endeavor, using
all good means, and remoouing the lets and hindrances which stop and hinder
our repentance, which is now the next thing we are to speak of.

LECT. VII.
VII. THE IMPEDIMENTS of Repentance.
Io^. 15. 31. Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity, for vanity shall
be his recompense.
THe Spirit of God by Solomon has justly taxed all things under the Sun to be
vanity and vexation of Spirit; All vanity.
so may I justly now being to speak of the impediments of Repentance, censure
all these lets and hindrances which detain men from this so necessary Grace,
under the Name of vanity, whatsoever they be: and vanity shall be their
recompense. We spoke the last day of the Practice of Repentance, wherein must
be four things; First, a man must search out his sins by the bright candle
of the word of God. Secondly, when he has found out his sins, then he must
be sorry for them. Thirdly, Then he must pray to God in Christ Jesus to
forgive them. Fourthly, Then he must resolve against them, that is renounce and
remove them as far as may be. Which practice of repentance must be not only
once in an age, or a man's life: but as our sins be daily, so our repentance
must be every day performed so long as we live in this life.

Now in the next place we are to speak of the Impediments of repentance; and
those deceits which hinder men and women from this duty. General or
universal motion (as Schoolmen say) is caused two ways: First, Either
Agendo, by enforcing up that which we mean to move, as when a man flings a
stone with his hand: Or Stone.
Remouendo prohibens quod impedit, or remoouing of that which hinders the
motion; as when a stone lies upon a shelfe, when one pulles this away, then by
and by down falls the stone of his own accord and yet he who pulled away the
shelfe caused that motion of the stone. But how? Not Agendo, by flinging of the
stone down; but by Remouendo prohibens, remoouing of that which hindered the
motion of it. Now as it is in universal motions, so also it is in special
motions of the mind; for they be caused, first either directly by an immediate
impression made upon the mind, as when a man is directly invited to goodness
or virtue. Secondly, or by remoouing the impediments which hinder us from it.
O^ the first I have spoken in the practice of repentance formerly. It shall not
therefore be amiss now to speak of the impediments in the next place: wherein
two things are required of every one:

1. Christian wisdom to find out the let. 2. Christian care to remove it.
wisdom, to be wise to find out these pressing down weights, as the Apostle
calls them. They who have water Water.
running home in pipes and conduits to their houses, as soon as they want that
which they see their neighbors have at their doors close by them, by and by
they search into the causes, and run to the conduit or the pipes, to see
wherethey be stop^, or what is the defect: Even so must every man do, when he
finds that the grace of Repentance flows into other men's hearts, and has no
recourse or access into his soul, by and by sit down and search himself
what the cause should be, where the rub lies which detaines the grace of
Repentance from him, seeing they that live (it may be) in the same house, sit
at the same table, lie in the same bed, they can be penitent for their sins,
sorry that they have offended God, and so complain in bitterness of soul
for their sins: but he that had the same means, the same occasions, more
sins to be humbled for more time to repent and more motives to draw him to
the duty, is not yet moved with the same, melted with grief, nor come near
this duty of contrition. Thus as I said, every man must look to himself,
what that is which hinders his repentance. We see when Devil cast out. Mat. 17.
19.
Christ cast out the devil, Mat. 17. 19. his disciples came unto him saying,
Why could not we cast him out? So when we see others in the course of their
life, and midst of their sins brought unto repentance, mourning and weeping
for sins whereby they have offended God; let us look into our selves, and
enquire at our own hearts, why we do not repent, why we cannot do as other
good people do. We have the same means, the same preaching, the same
exhortations, yea the same judgments, the same punishments, the same
afflictions. But (...), Where shall we find that man, or that woman, who are
thus careful to search into themselves? There is not one of a hundred, but
they lie still in their sins without repentance: and few or none desires to
search into the cause what it is which hinders their repentance, making them
unapt to so good a duty. We see in experience, let one come to light a candle,
if it will not presently take fire, we Candle.
imagine and run by and by to consider what should be the reason of it, and
we judge that the wicke is wet, or something is am^^le. O how wise men can be
for the things of this life, and are careless for those things which concern
eternal happiness.

W^ to know then that the Impediments of Repentance be of two sorts;

1. Some be in the Judgment. 2. Some be in the Affections.
Even as when a man is sick, and will not take the good physic which would
cure him, the defect is, either Sick man.
in his Judgment or in his Affections. In his Judgment, because either he
does not feel himself to be sick, though he be ill, he has no
apprehension thereof, or if her (...), yet he does not take it to be dangerous
or deadly: or though he think it dangerous, yet he thinks he may renoue it
without Physic, or if he must have physic, yet he needs not such physic,
or in such quality as is there prescribed. Yet there may be for all this a
storm in his Affections, though the Judgment do come on to yield: for either
a man may be so busy in the world that he cannot attend it, or spare time for
it, or he is so tender, that he cannot abide the least thing which may offend
him, or think physic to be bitter as many do. Yea, a number will choose to
die, rather then meddle with it. Now these be the reasons partly in judgment,
and partly in the Affections, why such sick patients will not admit of that
physic which might do them good. As the case is in bodily sickness, so is
it with those who are spiritually sick with sin. Repentance is that physic
which God has appointed for the healing of them, and curing of their souls,
which potion sinful men refuse to take, the causes being as I have showed,
partly in the Judgment, and partly in the affections.

Judgment, there be four impediments of Repentance; First, because men do
not know or find themselves to be sick of sin, nor would have others to
think them sick, they presume therefore that all is well with them, for they
know neither disease nor infirmity, and so because they live as others live,
and do as others do, they think Repentance needless: and feeling no sick
esse, they never think of Physic. This kind of deceit is reproved, Job
15. 31. Let not him that is deceived Job 15. 31.
trust in vanity, for vanity shall be his recompense. So we see Mal. 3. 7.
when God bade the people return Mal. 3. 7.
from their sins unto him, they answered stubbornly. Wherein shall we
return? So do the wicked men of this world answer God, wherein have we
offended? wherefore should I repent? This is the first Impediment in judgment,
when men do not find themselves sick in sin.

When men know themselves to be sick of sin, but do not think their
sins to be deadly; They think indeed they have some frailties, some
imperfections, some petty sins, some small sins: but in accusing themselves,
they can say as the Pharisee, Luke 18. I thank God I am no Adulterer,
Extortioner, etc. And so they think themselves in no danger. As a man that in
the eagerness of fighting, receueth a small wound One fighting.
with a sword, and never looks after it, or thinks it worth the curing; so
men in the affairs of the world, adding sin to sin, never look after them as
needing Repentance, because they suppose them slight and small, etc.

That though they take themselves to be sinners, and their sins to be
deadly; yet they think that God is merciful, a grateous God, and they may be
saved without Repentance. But Deuteronomy. 29. The Lord Deuteronomy. 29.
thunders against such: and plainly assures such presumptuous persons, that
his wrath shall smoke against such, and he would not be merciful unto them;
but all the curses written in that Book should come upon them, yea, this is
that which John Baptist exprobrateth the Jews for, Math. 3. 9. And think not
to say with your selves, Math. 3. 9.
we have Abraham for our Father: for verily I say unto you, that God is able
even of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.

That though we think Repentance is needful, yet we need not (say some) so
strict a kind of Repentance as the Scripture speaks of? If a man can say,
Lord forgive me, we are all sinners, and such like, it is sufficient, it will
serve the turn well enough. Pharaoh thought Repentance was needful, but it
was a slight Exodus
one, he did not think so strict a one needful as was prescribed. So Saul
thought Repentance needful when Samuel came and told him what he had done,
Yet says 1. Sam. 15. 24.
he, Honor me before the People, he cared not whether he had any honor
before God or not, so the people might honor him. These be the four
Impediments in the Judgment which hinder and keep back Repentance: either
that we do not find our selves to be sinners, or though we be sinners, yet
not so great sinners to require Repentance, or though we be sinners, yet God
is merciful, and can save us without our Repentance; Or, though we must
repent; yet that there is no need of so strict a Repentance.

Now as there be these impediments in the Judgment, so there be also in the
Affections diverse letts, for although a man finds himself to be a sinner
against God and his own conscience, and that there is no way of Reconciliation
to come out of his sin, but by Repentance; Yet he still finds impediments in
his Affections to detain and hold him from this so necessary duty.

The Impediments in the Affections,
1 Impediment in the Affections.
Are first, The love of the world, when men are so carried away with the love
thereof, that they cannot attend unto Repentance, so taken up with the cares of
life, and the hopes of pleasures, prosite, preferment, and such like, that they
can neither come to this account and reckoning of the soul with Repentance,
nor dare adventure upon it, for fear of losing the benefits of a present
life. Such was the case of those who were invited to Christ's Banquet, Math. 22.
5. Such also is our case, we are all so intentive Math. 22. 5.
to these worldly affairs, our Farms, our wives, our oxe^, etc. that we
cannot come unto Repentance, which is, the Banquet of our souls to attain
salvation.

The love of our Pleasure, that is, men Psalm. 22. 14. 15.
cannot abide the sober and sad things that belong to Repentance, they must be
merry, they must have their delights, pastimes, and devices, as Esaias 22. 13.
The Lord Esaias 22. 13.
complains, that when he called to sorrow and mourning, behold joy and
gladness, killing of oxen, eating of flesh, and drinking of wine. Thus
pleasure is great a let.

The love of our own Ease: for men cannot endure to take any pains in prayer,
holy duties, thing appertaining to the saving of their souls: they had rather
lie warm in their soft beds, then rise to religious exercises, then go to
heaven in Elias fiery chariot. It is said, Math. 2. That when Christ was borne,
all Israel Math. 2.
was troubled, and why? they thought Christ could not come into his kingdom
without a great deal of trouble, and it might be, cost many of their lives: so
do many now adays shun religion for their own ease. It is said, Psalm, They
despised the pleasant land; and why did they despise it, for it was a pleasant
land indeed: and a Good land.
good land? yea, such a place as they could have been contented to have
inioyed it; but because it asked of them so much pain, trouble, and (in their
sight) hazard to go to it; therefore they did despise it: even so heaven it is
a good thing, and men could be content with that, but because it will cost them
such a deal of trouble and pains, therefore they care not for it.

The love of their sins, men and women are so entangled with them, that they
cannot leave them for their lives, Math. 2. 3. how were all Jerusalem troubled,
and the Priests for the birth of Christ: Birth of Christ
and Esau he could not leave his strange wives, he did so dote upon them, Genesis
28. 9. Although hereby he lost the Genesis 28. 9.
favor of his Father. Even so men do dote upon their sins, and so love
them, that they had rather part with Heaven and happiness, and with Gods
favor then with them.

The desire to keep credit with the world^ to do as other men do; for they
think, if they repent and take a new course of life, the world will then point
at them, they shall be accounted precise and pure men, this is that which does
hinder many men in their Repentance: So to this purpose the Jews, Pharisees
inquire. But do any of the Rulers believe in him? and John 4. 22. John. 4. 22.
it is said, That many believed in him, but did not confess him because of the
Jews. Now, this is the reason why men live in their sins without Repentance,
because they are not wise to find out the special let, which does hinder
them. If I might be bold to make a secret question in the Church now, to know
what is the reason we do not repent and feeke Gods favor? seeing we have
heard, it is so needful, so necessa^ie a Grace, without which no man can be
saved, why then do we not repent and seek Gods favor, what is that which
does hinder you? Is it not letts either in judgments or in affections? Is it
not because you think you are not sinners? or not great sinners? or that you
think you may be saved without Repentance, or at least, if this may not be,
yet that you need not so serious, particular and strict a Repentance: as we
teach you out of the word. If these let you not, are there not then letts in
your Affections? that you so love the world, and are so vigilant about the
things of this life, that you have no time to think of your sins: or is it
not because ye love your pleasures, and cannot abide the sad thoughts of
Repentance; or, because you love your own ease, and cannot abide trouble; or
is it not because you love your sins and dote upon them? or is it not because
you would keep credit with the world? How can you be able to answer to these
things? I grant it is an easy matter to find out the let, and to lay the
^^nger on the sore, and to say, this is the Bar which hinders; but men are
loath to deal so roundly with themselves, as to search out that which does
hinder their Repentance?

Now when we have found out the Impediment, we must remove it; It was the care
of the women when they Mark. 16. Sepulcher.
came to the Sepulcher of Christ, to remove the stone: so our care must be to
remove out of the way, what does hinder and let us in the course of
Repentance. We read 2. Sam. 20. 12. That when all the people stood still at
Amasaes 2. Sam 20 12. Amasaes corpse.
dead corpse, the men took it and drew it out of the way; and then the people
(who formerly stood still as they came) followed their leaders. Even so must
we do, when our thoughts be at a stand, and will not suffer us to go on in
the race of Repentance, by and by rid them out of the way, remove them when
they hinder us, pull them aside, cast a cloth over them, and let nothing hinder
us in our Christian course. To this purpose we may observe Abraham's wisdom
and care, Genesis 22. 5. when he went to sacrifice his son, the text says, that
he left his servant with the Asses, and why so? that his servants Servants lest.
might not hinder him with their clamours and cries. Abraham in godly wisdom
left them with the Asses; even so must we do in the case of Repentance, with
whatsoever may hinder us in our Christian course of service and holy duty: we
must leave such things with the Asses; (that is,) we must renounce and remove
such things whatsoever they be, that we be not disappointed: and if it be
defects of judgment and affections which hinder us, we must pray unto God to
remove the same. And wherefore all this? Because there are but two gates all
men are to enter in at, there is a little Iron gate of repentance, which
opens to life and salvation, to heaven and happiness, and to Gods favor,
and the great golden gate is that of worldly pleasure and profit, which
opens and leads to death and destruction, to hell and to torments for ever.
Threfore at your choice be it (dear Brethren) which gate you will enter in at,
the Iron gate of prayers and repentance in this life of Christianity, which
leads unto the house of God, or the golden gate of worldly pleasures leading
to Hell and destruction.

LECT. VIII.
VIII. THE CASES OF Repentance. First the case of Relapse.
REVEL. 25. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and Repent, and do
the first works: or else I will come unto thee quickly, and remove the
Candlestick out of this place, unless thou repent.
WE spoke the last day of the Letts and Impediments of Repentance, because as
I said our way is made unto Repentance by remoouing the Letts: Now the next
thing we are to speak of is the Cases of Repentance; wherein the first shall be
The case of Revolt or Relapse, as they term it, and that is, Whether a man
that has once repented him of a sin; may fall again into the same sin.

I.
If a man have not soundly repented him of his sin, if he have failed in any
one point of his repentance, in such case he may fall easily again into the
same sins: As for example, a man has been a notorious riotour and
cup-companion, he comes Riotour.
afterward to look into the hatefulness of his sin, to condemn it in
judgment, to mislike it in affection, and yet because he could never bring his
heart to resolve and fight against it, to sigh and be truly penitent; to
fashion himself to the use of good exercises; as Prayer, Meditation, and a
solemn arraignement of himself, and such like, he may easily fall again,
because he has failed in some one point of his Repentance. So a man who has
been a Papist, and a worshipper of stocks and stones, he A Papist.
comes to see his sin, to dislike it, to condemn and resolve against it;
thereupon he turns from Popery, and yet because he is not truly turned into
the obedience of the Gospel, to walk in holiness before God, failing in some
one or more parts of his repentance, he may fall to be a Papist again. So
Pharaoh did in some manner repent Exodus 9. 27.
him of his sin, yet because he failed in the due practice and performance
of the duty, his heart being corrupted, he remained obstinate. So the Lord
complains of the people, in the Prophesies of Esaias and Jeremy 3. 3. Thou
had a whoores forehead, thou refusedst Ier. 3. 3.
to be ashamed; So that because of unsound repentance, a man may easily fall
into the same sins again. Judas saw his sins and confessed them, but
because he did not Math.
pray unto God to forgive them, nor resolve against them, he fell away. We see
in experience, if a man have a Fellon A Fellon.
or a soar upon his hand, or a byle about him, if he do not draw out the
corruption the better, but suffer it to rankle or swell again, having stopped it
too soon, it will break out again, and put him to further trouble and pain:
Even so it is in the nature of Repentance; a number there be who have not
searched their hearts to the quick, or suffered them to bleed out all the
corruption; And so having dealt partially and unsoundly in their repentance,
they find it a matter of great difficulty to have the heart perfectly sound:
this is the first part of the Answer.

But if a man have soundly repented him of his sins, whether is it possible
for that man to fall again?

There is a General, and there is a Particular Repentance. General repentance
is at a man's first conversion, then he repents of all his sins; Particular
repentance is, when a man repents of some one particular sin, which is
committed after. Now a man may repent generally for all his sins, and yet he
may easily also fall into particular sins again, for every thing so works
(as they say in Philosophy) according to the property of his own nature, And
so General repentance can but work a general dislike of sin. Now therefore
a man may mislike sin in general, and yet fall into particular sins of
which he has so generally repented.



(...)
thereof is such, that it leaves such an impression behind it, as they tremble
to fall into the like sin again. We read. Exodus 13. 17. 18. that when God
lead the Exodus 13. 17. 18.
children of Israel out of Egypt, he did not lead them the readiest and
nearest way, but he led them through the wilderness, a dangerous and fearful
way, full of fiery Isreal's Peregrination.
Serpents; and why ^o (...) That they might be afraid to return to Egypt.
And even so does he deal by his servants when he brings them out of the
bondage and thraldom of sin, he leads them a tedious and painful way by
many tears, by many sorrows; yea, the fear of Death and Hell; and all this,
that they may be afraid to return again unto Egypt to their former lusts
and sins again: By which means a number of Gods people and servants have
been preserved from their sins and have repented.

Though a man fall into the same sins after Repentance, yet he very seldom so
falls, There be some who think that if one have truly repented of a
particular sin, he never falls into it again, but I dare not say so; For a
man who repents him of the sin of hastiness and rash anger, and particularly
of scolding and rash speeches, may fall again into the same sin that he has
repented, but this I say, if a man has truly repented him of a sin, he
shall very seldom fall into it, nor shall ever so often offend in that kind:
As we see in a man that has been sick of an Ague, and is recovered again
almost well, yet he may have some fitts and grudgings Sick Ague.
of it, though not so often or extreme as before he had. Even so, though we
have repented, we may have some falls and grudgings, but not so often, nor in
those extremes as formerly.

Yet they fall not so evidently toward damnation, but with apparent difference
from the former.

1 Caution, They fall not damnably.
For first, all the falls of those that have truly repented, Be but particular
falls, they be not fallings away from all the graces of God, from all the love
of goodness, from all the conscience of duty, but only from some particulars;
The wicked of the world when they fall into sin, do not stay themselves in
some one particular sin, but let all go at random, and make a conscience of
nothing. But the people of God, though they fail in some one duty, yet they
liu^ sincerely and carefully in all the rest, as Revel. 2. The Churches are
commended Revel. 2.
for many things, though discommended in some things: As Asa in Scripture, 1.
King. 15. 14. But the high places 1. King. 15. 14.
were not taken away, nevertheless Asa his heart was perfect with the Lord all
his days. So David though a sinner in some things excuses himself, Psalm. 18.
21. For I Psalm. 18. 21.
have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
Yea, it is further said of David, that he was a man after Gods own heart, and
kept all the commandments of God, saving in the matter of Vriah, so howsoever
the godly Fall, they fall not from all the duties of Religion, grace and
goodness, but hold themselves to prayer and other holy duties. As a man in the
climbing of a ladder, though his foot slip, yet if he Ladderclimbing.
hold surely by his hands, he will not let his hold go: so it is with the
people of God, though their feet slip through frailty and weakness, yet they
hold fast by the hands, and will not let go their hold of Heaven which they
have by faith in God.

2 Caution with strife.
Again, If they fall, they fall with strife and resistance, there is a kind of
loathing and reluctation in their falls; The motions of the spirit seek to
hinder the works of the flesh: as Gal. 5. 17. For the flesh lusts against
Gal. 5. 16.
the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, so that you cannot do those
things which ye would. Thus though a man do fall after Repentance, yet there
is ever joined with it a certain unwillingness to fall, and follow the
motions of the flesh: as a man that is loath to do that which he is drawn
and forced to do, as St. Paul says of himself, Rom, 7. 15. For that which I
do, I allow not: Rom 7 15.
for what I would, that do I not, but what I hate, that do I. We see this
also in Peter, he denied his Master fearfully, and very faintly, but yet
presently got him into the porch from the press of the people, and was indeed
ashamed of what he had done; as a man who by mischance is all beastly and
durty, is loath to be seen by One durtie.
day; so after sin men are ashamed to appear before God, being confounded
and stricken in their very conscience: So in Exodus in the story of Aaron,
Exodus 32. 2. Exodus 32 2.
you may read how feign would he have shifted o^^ that sin? what excuses
did he make, how loath was he to do it?

3 They fall with fear.
Thirdly, Cum formidine, men sin in this kind fearfully, with a secret fear,
they are afraid to sin; they tremble and fear at Gods displeasure, whereas
the world are every way fearelesse, bold and venturous, and practice sin as
if they were neither afraid of Heaven or Hell, or the loss of Gods favor,
which though they have heard of, yet they sin still. But when the true
Christian sins, it is Cum formidine, with fear, as the four Lepers entered
the Camp of the Assyrians and robbed Four Lepers.
their tents, but with a kind of fear and trembling, 2. King. 7. etc. So it
is with the people of God in their 2. King. 7.
sins, the heart is struck, and they are ashamed of what they do, being
afraid to bring Gods ^udgements upon them. Therefore there is a great
difference in the falls of the one and the other; the one goes on in sin with
boldness, the other are afraid, and tremble at Gods displeasure. There is
(we know) a great difference betwixt him that falls, and him that goes into a
deep dangerous Going and falling in water.
water; he that falls into a water, he does it with fear; he is dismayed at
the peril and danger he is in, but he that goes in of himself has a
purpose to do so, he does it advisedly, and is never afraid, but boldly
aduentureth on the danger; so it is with the people of God, they fall into
their sins with fear out of the frailty of the flesh, against their own
minds, to the displeasure of their hearts, but therest do not so, but sin
purposely and advisedly.

4 They desire to rise again. Job 14. 7.
Fourthly, Though the godly fall, yet they desire to recover and to rise again;
as Job 14. 7. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
sproute again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease: Though the
root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock die in the ground: Even so
it is with the people of God, that howsoever the graces of God decay in them,
and that they wax dry in them, yet as long as there is life in the root; and
that the root once comes to be watered and renewed by the grace of the
Spirit, they live again by Repentance, coming unto Reformation and newness
of life; as you saw in David, Peter, Mary Magdalen, Mannasses: So David, Psalm.
119. vlt. I have gone astray Psalm. 119. vlt.
like a lost sheep; seek thy servant for I have not forgotten thy
commandments: David was lost as it were, but he desired to come home again.
A sheep you know A sheep.
when it is gone astray, and is out of the sheepfold from the fellows, is not
at rest till it be in the sheep-fould again; so the people of God when they
fall by their sins and corruptions, they are not at quiet or rest until they
have returned home to God, and are in the sheepfold again.

If this be so that one may fall again into the same sins after Repentance;
what comfort can any man have in this estate.

yet they never fall quite away, so long as they hold them to the use of good
means, attend to Prayer, reading, meditation, and other religious exercises,
reading and hearing of the Word preached: the administering of the Sacraments,
with watchfulness over our own hearts, lives, and courses. David fell not
when he was constant in 2 Samuel
these courses, but when he began to be loose and idle. So likewise Judah one
of Jacobs sons, committed a Genes.
great sin, but when was it; when he was constant in good courses, holding
himself unto good means: no^, but it was when he grew loose, and left the
society of his brethren and neglected good means: but if we hold our selves
constantly to the means, we shall not fall into gross sins.

Paul says, Romans 8. 28. All things shall work together for the best, unto
them that love God. And Augustine Romans 8. 28.
to this purpose says, That it is good that the Lord let some men fall into
sin, that they the better may see what they are by nature, and be yet more
humbled for it: As we see if a child be busy about the fire or water; the
father will of purpose put the fire to his child's fingers, Child, fire, water.
not with intent to hurt him, but to make him afraid: so when God sees his
children too busy with sin, he will bring them near some punishment or
judgment to bring them unto repentance, and at last comfort them.

This much might seem to have been enough of this case of repentance: but
because as in the goodly building of some fair house, the master pillars have
more workmanship Fair building
and labor then any other particulars, as we read of the two maine pillars of
Salomons Temple, 2. Chron, 3. 15. So because that Faith and Repentance be the
maine 2. Chron. 3. 15.
pillars in building the spiritual house of God in our consciences, it is no
marvel if they take up more labor and time then all the rest Chrysostom says
well, That fone in digging do light upon a mine of gold, he will diggestil, and
never give over, till that vein does fail; so because A mine of gold.
we are lighted upon a vein the Doctrine of Repentance, more precious than
Gold; and Faith that will stand by us in our death, when our gold will leave
us: do not blame me, if I dig still, labor still, as long as I may bring
you advantage.

Now having handled the first branch of this first case, come we to the second
branch thereof.

II.
2 Branch.
Whether a man that thus falls into the same sin again, may be renewed by
repentance.

I answer two ways: That a man may though with difficulty; that is, if a man
fall often and apparently into the same sins, it is so much the more hard and
difficult to be cured and renewed; as we see in the body, if a man fall into
the Relapse of an Ague, or any Relapse of an Ague.
dangerous disease, it may cost him his life, and his health will very hardly
be recovered: Even so it is, after a man has fallen into the same sin
again. I do not say he may not recover, or be renewed by repentance, but it
will the more hardly be done, and it will cost much terror, labor and sorrow.
We may then see that in this case recovery is possible, and that upon three
grounds.

From the generality of the Promise, which in general is made to pardon of all
sins, except the sin against the Holy Ghost: as Math. 12. Uerily Math. 12.
31.
verily I say unto you, that all sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven a man,
except the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. But a man may fall into Relapses
through weakness, which is not the sin against the Holy Ghost, and therefore
may be forgiven.

The second ground is taken A comparatis: From the 2 Luke 17. 4.
condition of the Promise, Luke 17. 4. Where Christ has given us a
commandment that we should forgive our brother seventy times seven times a
day, so often as he repents and is sorrowful: and Math. 6. Christ
threatens, Math. 6. 14.
If you do not forgive your brother his trespasses, no more will your beauenly
Father forgive you your trespasses. So then, if a man must forgive his
trespasses that his brother trespasseth against him so often, all which is not
a drop of mercy compared with Gods mercy; how much more will God forgive them
that sin against him, again, and again, if they do repent, seeing he is
the Ocean of mercy and goodness.

ab Exemplis: from sanctified examples of holy Scripture, for we see in the
book of Judges, when there were any bad Judges in Israel, the people fell away
from God unto Idolatry, and when there came good Judges, the Prophets came and
exhorted the people to return again unto God and repent, Judges.
and so they did recover again. So in the Book of Kings we see that when bad
Kings came, they fell away from God, and yet when good Kings came again, the
Prophets preached and exhorted them; and they repented, and were received into
favor again. Here therefore we have to acknowledge the kindness and mercy of
God. It is his mercy to forgive us, if we do sin but once in our lifetime
against him. But great and exceeding great is his mercy; that when we have
sinned and sinned so exceeding often against him, that (even then) upon
repentance he will receive us. We read the Lord declares this much, Ier. 3.
If a man put away his wife, and she become another man's: If she return again
to her husband, Ierem. 3.
shall not this land be polluted: but thou have played the harlot with many
lovers, yet return again to me says the Lord. Thus there may be
forgiveness, even after many relapses. It is the charity of the Popish
Church, if a man relapse into Heresy, though he do repent, he cannot be
forgiven. The Pope and his Cardinals will not, may not forgive him, but the
kindness and tenderness of God is such, that though a man do fall into the
same sin he has repented of, he may be forgiven, and shall upon
Repentance be forgiven. Oh then, shall not the despisers of Gods kindness
be judged of him.

Though Repentance be possible, yet it will be very hard and difficult; and
that in two respects; First in respect of God:

1. God will not be so easily entreated to forgive, I do not say that he will
not forgive, but that he more hardly remits these sins, then others. 2. In
respect of our selves, we shall not find our selves so ready, nor our hearts
so apt to repent, in this Relapse, as otherwise we might have done.
This then I say, that if we provoke the Lord too often with some sins, we
shall not find him so ready to forgive as at other times, nor so easy to be
entreated: So says our Savior Christ, John 5. 14. Behold thou art John 5. 14.
made whole, sin no more, left a worse thing come unto thee. And so if we do
sin, Deterius accidet; a worse thing may befall us. Look into the tenth of
Judges, Judge. 10. 13. 14
and there you shall find how the children of Israel had fallen into Apostasy
concerning their Idolatry, which they repented of, and so prayed unto the
Lord, but the Lord would not hear their prayers, but turned them off with
scorn, deriding them: the words are these; Yet ye have for saken me and
served other gods, therefore I will deliver you no more, go and cry unto the
gods whom ye have chosen, let them deliver you in the time of your
Tribulation. So then, if we make no conscience to fall into a sin often
which we have repented of; let us not marvel if God do not hear us at the
first; for if we stand upon terms with God for the hearing and helping of us
by and by, take heed he say not unto us, go away I will not help you, go
unto your sins, and the worldly pleasures, profits, honors that you have
served, let them help you. It is true indeed, that all the Scriptures declare
God to be a merciful God; to be full of compassion, and very ready to
forgive, but when we shall therefore imbolden our selves to sin, and
desperately come to ask Almighty God, how often we may sin: if it be but
once or twice it is too much; but say it be once or twice, and the Lord
forbeares us with patience, then let us beware we do not provoke the Lord by
falling back unto the same sins after we have repented, for when it comes
to Quoties peccavtmus, how often have we offended in the same sin, the Lord
no question will be much displeased, hardly drawn to forgive, and not easily
appeased toward such offenders; for he complains of such, Psalm. 78. 40. How
often did Psalm 78. 40.
they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the Desert? And Psalm.
95. 8. To day if you will hear his Psalm. 95. 8.
voice, harden not your hearts, as in the Provocation of the wilderness, when
your fathers tempted me. And Job 40. 5. he says, Once have I spoken, but I
will speak no more; yea twice, but I will proceed no further? Job. 40. 5.
Math. 25. How often says God would I have gathered Math. 25.
thee together, as a hen gathers her chickens, but ye would not. Forty
years long (says he of his own people) was I vexed with you in the
wilderness: If it had been but for some few years, he could have borne the
matter, but it was forty years together; God is indeed very ready, and
merciful to forgive, but when it is so often committed, this makes Gods ears
be heavy and stopped to our cries; yea, and our selves to be so much the more
unfit for the business. I speak not this to cut off any man from the hope of
pardon: God forbid that we should take away mercy from the Lord, but to show
that men which fall into the Relapse of the same sins are in greater danger
then before, and it makes God the less ready to forgive them, and to be
entreated of them.

In regard of our selves, it works a difficulty in us, we being so much the
harder hearted, and less ready to repent. First, because of the nature of
sin, which is to leave a promptness and readiness in us to the same sin:
leaving a stain and a blot behind it; as when by often lifting up a burden,
we find it lighter and lighter, and pass away with it so much the more
slightly; so by often offending we make our selves the readier to sin, and
so come to hardness of heart; and backwards to repent. To this purpose is that
speech of the Prophet, Ier. 13. 23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or
the Leopard his spots, then may you also do good who are accustomed to do
evil? Secondly, because as Dionysius has it, Consuetudo peccandi, tollit
sensum peccandi; so that when a man falls into a sin, by continuing in the
same, he becomes the less sensible and feeling of the same; which makes him
the hardlier to be drawn to repentance. For as you see it is dangerous for a
man to have a bone broken often in some one place, for Bone broken.
it may hardly be joined again, or fester, or never come to its full strength:
So when a man falls into the same sin, he shall find much ado to rise and
recall himself; as a man that at the first goes away from the fire, it makes
Chill from fire.
him the more chill and cold after, but after that he has been a time in the
cold, he can the better endure it: So it is with sin, when we commit it at
first, our judgments are against it; our reasons fight against it, and our
consciences are checked and unquiet for it: But if a man continue in it and
sin often, he is never touched for it, but his heart becomes past feeling,
secure, and hardened, and so the work is more difficult in regard of our
selves. And thus if appears, that there is pardon for such who fall into the
same sin again; but it is very hard and difficult to attain the sense and
assurance of it.

Heb 6. 4. 5. For it is impossible that they who were once enlightened, and
have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
and have tasted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to
come; if they fall away should be renewed by Repentance.

goodness, which is that St. Paul speaks of, then it is impossible to be
renewed by repentance, because such can never repent; but if a man do fall but
from degrees of grace, he may recover again, for mention is made only of
falling from all duties of Religion and grace, otherwise the Saints falling
only from degrees and some measures of Grace, may recover again and be
renewed by Repentance.

Heb. 10. 26. For if we Heb. 10, 26.
sin willingly after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there
remains no more sacrifice for sin, but a fearful looking for of Judgment,
etc.

willingly, signifies wilfully and spitefully, as it were of purpose to vex
and grieve the Spirit of God. Thus to do (after a man has received the
knowledge of the truth) for such a one there remains no more sacrifice for
sins, because his hard heart shall never repent, whom God thus gives over:
but for sins done otherwise willingly often; yea, against conscience and
knowledge: there remains always Sacrifices even after Repentance, knowledge
of the truth and enlightened tasting of the heavenly gift; For the Gospel must
no where be stricter, but much more comfortable to miserable sinners then the
Law was. Now under the Law there was of purpose constant reiterated sacrifices
for sins done even willingly: as Leuit. 6. 2. Leuit. 6, 2, 3. 4.
3. 4. Therefore much more it must be so under the state of Grace in the
Gospel.

LECT. IX.
II. THE CASE OF ITEration of Repentance.
DAN. 9. 10. Neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in
his laws which he set before us by his servants the Prophets.

Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy Law, even by departing, that they might
not obey thy voice, therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is
written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against
him, etc.


OF the first case of Repentance we have already spoken, as also of the two
branches thereof; First, whether a man that has repented a sin, may fall
again into the same sin? Secondly, whether so falling, he may be renewed
by Repentance.

The case of Iteration of Repentance: which is, whether a man that has truly
Repented him of a sin once, be bound to Repent the same sin over and over
again.

The case is clear, that a man is bound to repent one and the same sin
often: The answer is easy, but the explication is hard; but I will lay it
down affirmatively, A man can never too often repent him of a sin, but the
more he repents, the more comfortable shall be his life, and his prayers more
answering: Indeed if a man's repentance were perfect at first, then a man need
but once repent a sin. But because all our Repentance is defective, and that
it is found a work of great difficulty, therefore it must be often done, to
assure that it is well done. So seeing our repentance does still want somewhat
of weight, we had need go often and again to renew the same. We see a man
in rowing may lose more at a stroke, then he can recover at three or four
again; so a Rowe^.
man may lose more by one act of sin, then he can recover by many acts of
Repentance. So, this is the state of a Christian, sin once, and repent often,
by the sin of an hour we gather matter of mourning and heaviness for many
years after; so that the case is clear, a man who has repented truly of a
sin, is bound often to repent of the same sin. A Painter when he makes a
Painter.
goodly picture, he draws line upon line, and color upon color, till he
have perfected his picture; so must it be in Repentance, we must renew our
sorrow and grief for sin, till our repentance be perfect; for if it were
weighed at the best in the Balance of the Sanctuary, as Balteshazar was, it
would be found light. We see in Dan. 5.
David's experience, how stood the case with him after he had committed that
great sin, 2. Sam. 12. 13. of murder 2. Sam. 12 13.
and adultery, upon his Repentance the Prophet Nathan told him that his sin
was pardoned, that God had put away his sin, and yet David cast himself
down with great humiliation, would never have done with his repentance, but
lamented and mourned for it long after: So though we have repented of a sin,
we must not think to buy our peace at so easy a rate, but humble our souls
with sorrow and tears, renewing our repentance again and again, never
leaving till we have pacified the wrath of God: for how often does this holy
man plye this suit? So Psalm 25 he prays God not to Psalm. 25.
remember the sins of his youth: So you see David did repent him of those
sins he had repented of before. Chrysostom says well, that David still
repented of sins Chrysostom.
done long before, as though they had been done but yesterday.

Saint Paul did not only repent of his sin of persecuting the Church of God
at his first conversion, Act. Act. 9. 9.
9. 9. but as often as he remembered it, as often does he speak of it with grief
and sorrow, 1. Tim. 1. 13. I was before a 1. Tim. 1. 13.
blasphemer, a persecutor, injurious, etc. So 1. Cor. 15. 9. I am not worthy
(says he) to be called an Apostle, because 1. C^r. 15. 9.
I persecuted the Church of God: So that St. Paul you see does often remember
his sins past and confesses them. This much we may well observe when God
Cyrill observes it. Paradise.
cast Adam out of Paradise, he sent him eregione horti, and set and placed him
over against the garden in the very sight and view of the place which he had
lost through his sin and offending God, and why was this? that so often as
he looked into the garden, he might remember his sin and lament for it. Now
that which Adam did in the beholding of the Garden, is that which we must do
in the beholding of Heaven, he saw from whence he was cast, thrown out of
Paradise by reason of his sin; and we see what we are sure to lose, even
heaven it self by reason of our sin, if we do not repent and humble our
souls, and that timely and daily. Thus you see it is clear that a Christian
is bound to repent one and the same sin diverse times, and as often as he looks
up to heaven to sigh and groan for the loss of it, and not to be satisfied,
though he have repented to day, and so is assured of pardon, but in the Name of
God to go to it again to morrow, and to morrow, and never give over.

If a man's sins upon his Repentance be pardoned, then what need is there upon
this to repent any more? this appears to be labor lost.

Three causes of renewing Repentance.
Repentance, yet there are three causes why a man's repentance must be renewed;
1
First, because, Eadem manet obligatio: the same Bond remains still, for
though God out of his own goodness and mercy forgive our sins, yet
nevertheless have we the same Cause to condemn our selves, to dislike and
be sorry for it, because the same bond or tie remains still, though God have
graciously pardoned it, yet it is our duty to repent still: Nay to speak as
the truth is; Crescit obligatio; our bond is the greater, for the more mercy
and goodness God shows us in the pardoning of our sins, we have always
the more cause to be abased and ashamed that we have sinned against him. This
(as we see) made an exaggeration in David's grief, In to solum peccaui, I have
Psalm. 51.
sinned against thee alone; what had David sinned against none but God? no
question against Uriah, Barsheba, and the people, but that went to the heart of
him most of all, and did more deeply touch him, that he had given God cause to
be angry with him, who was so ready to forgive him, that had showed him so
great kindness and mercy in the pardoning and forgiving of all his sins. So
Gods mercy to us in pardoning our sins, should not be a means to abate our
repentance, but rather to augment and increase it, because there remains in us
still the same seeds of ouglinesse, vileness, deformity and corruption as
formerly, the pardon whereof being great, should continually augment and
reiterate our Repentance with holy David, Psalm. 103. Praise the Lord Psalm. 103.
O my soul, praise the Lord, and forget not all his benefits: who forgiues
thee all thy sins, etc. Thus Gods mercy in forgiveness of sins should not
abate, but increase our repentance; as we see in the story of the Prodigal
son, Luke 15. 20. he had a purpose to confess Luke 15. 20. 21. Prodigal.
his sin, when he returned to his Father: his Father could not contain
himself for joy, but run out to meet and embrace him; yet this makes him not
slack in his former determination to humble himself, but rather spurs him
to fall down and humble himself unto his Father, confessing his faults: So
Gods readiness to forgive us, should be so far from abating our repentance,
that it should rather provoke us unto the same, so much the more to increase
it. If a woman should commit wickedness Adulterer.
and folly against her husband, who puts her away for it, and afterward should
be bent not only to receive her and forgive her freely this lewd offense, but
also welcome her, and bestow upon her rich ornaments and jewels: this kindness
of her husbands, (if any natural affection be in her,) would make her the more
to lament and grieve for having offended so kind and merciful a husband, and
remember it to her dying day: so it is with Gods readiness in pardoning our
sins, it cannot choose but make us the more ready upon all occasions from
time to time, to repent and be sorry that we had offended so good and
gracious a God.

Yet the more a man repents, the more he shall have the sense and feeling of
the pardon of them; for a man may have his sin pardoned before God, and yet
have no sense and feeling in his own conscience of the pardon of it, for there
is still retained a fear of guilt, as we see in David, 1. Sam. 12. his sin
was pardoned 1. Sam. 12.
before God, and yet there remained (as commonly in such cases) such an
impression of guilt, as he had no comfort for all this, or as if there had
been no such matter. And so, though God forgive our sins upon our first
repentance, yet the more we repent, the more sensible we shall be of the
forgiveness and pardon of them. In other cases we can say, Abundantia cautela
non nocebit, too much caution hurts not, as when a man comes to lock a chest
or a door wherein lies his gold Door.
and treasure, he will turn the key again and again: sir (says his friend)
the door was fast before: yea but (says the other) in cases of this nature,
it is good to be sure to make fast work; as then covetous men say thus by
their money and jewels; so let us say of our salvation, in businesses of this
nature, it is good to be sure, a man cannot be too cautelous in making and
procuring a pardon for his sins: so that after repentance, a man is always
the better and readier to repent and comfort himself. It was the zealous and
holy care of that good man Job, chap. 1. 5. to say, I will go see my sons,
for it Job. 1. 5. Job.
may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. So should
every Christian say in this matter; It may be that I have failed in my
Repentance, and therefore I will to it again to make sure work.

Because repentance is required not only to take away the guilt of sin, but
also to take away the corruption of it. We see when Christ was dead and
buried, the Jews Jews.
rolled a great stone upon the mouth of his grave, and why? to make him fast
that he should not rise; now we must do with our sins as the Jews did by
Christ, not only bury them our selves and make a grave for them, but also we
must roll a great stone upon them, and seal them up by repentance, every day
casting more mold and earth upon them, that they never may rise against us; For
often repenting of sin abates the strength of the corruption of sin in the
root. As a man that has his house on fire, he will not only quench the fire
for Fire.
the present, but pour water also in the cinders and ashes, for fear of some
living sparks or dissipating heat which may lie hidden therein: so must we
do by our sins, when the devil has set our lusts on fire; it must be our
wisdom not only to quench the motions for the present, but also as it were
to pour water on them to quench the ashes of sin.

That if a man be bound continually to renew his Repentance, and Repentance
be enjoined with grief and sorrow, then it must needs follow that a Christian
man must never be merry, because still the sense of his own sin will take
him down and make him sad and dejected.

That as a man is bound to renew his Repentance, so is he bound to renew his
Faith too: Yea, the more he renewes his Repentance, the more he is bound to
renew his Faith and joy: thus as a man's sins give him cause to mourn, so the
Lords mercy in Christ Jesus, will give him grace to rejoice: So that the
renewing of Repentance, though it bring a man to grief, yet it will not leave
him in sorrow, but set him in a most full possession of everlasting comfort, as
David confesses, Psalm. 126, 5. They Psalm. 126. 5.
who sow in tears shall reap in joy. So that there are some tears which
will bring joy: there is a kind of mourning which ends in rejoicing. It is
observed in nature, that there is some pain which brings a man ease, Pain.
and a man can never have ease, but by the means of this pain; As the pain
of physic, which does not work at first without some trouble, yet brings
health at last. The pain also that a man feels in dressing of a soar Pain.
(for there are none but I am sure will confess it puts a man to pain) brings
a man at last to more ease and refreshing; so that we may well say, the pain
is the cause of the Cure; Even so the renewing of Repentance causes a pain,
no man can deny that, because it is accompanied with grief and sadness,
sorrow and tears, but it is Dolor and Tristitia sanitatis, a healing and a
healthful pain, such a pain as will leave many joys, and much peace behind
it. Therefore let men never be afraid to renew their Repentance for their
sins, though they repented before; Let them upon every good occasion repent
of them still, because though this course of Repentance bring a man sorrow, yet
it will never leave him long in heaviness, but bring into a sweet and
comfortable peace with God and his own conscience; when though weeping and
heaviness may be in the evening, yet joy and cheerfulness comes in the
morning; such mourning and confessing, ransaking of the heart ends in
blessedness; ever the more spiritual mourning, the more cheerful holy
rejoicing: they come from one root and fountain, the other show it self
first: yet all is swallowed up into rejoicing at last. Now follows the

III. Case of Repentance.
Whether a man be bound, and must repent of his sins, and confess them unto
men? That is, when a man has repented him of his sins unto God, whether he
must also repent of his sins unto men such as himself is, and not only to
confess all unto God alone? Which case, (as the law speaks) has a cloven
hoof; that is, it parts and diuides it self into two Questions.

1. Whether a man be bound to confess his sins to men? 2. Whether a man be
bound to make satisfaction and Restitution?
For the first, here be two extreamities to be shunned: whether a man be bound
to confess his sins unto men? First, the Papists they think that a man is
bound to confess all his sins unto man; that it is not enough to confess
them unto God, unless they also confess them unto Priests: in this they are
in one extreme; And in the contrary are they that think that a man must
confess all his sins unto God only. Now both these extremes are erroneous,
both the Papists who think we are bound to confess our sins unto men, and
some other carnal professors, who think that we must confess our sins
unto God only; for the truth lies in the middle way betwixt both: For a man is
not bound to confess all his sins unto any man, and yet some sins there
are which must be confessed to men, as well as some other that it is enough if
we confess unto God only.

Now for the clearing of this point, we must remember that in the high Court of
conscience sins be of two sorts:

1. Sins against God. 2. Sins against men.
As that of 1, Sam. 2. 25. shows, If one man sin against 1. Sam. 2. 25.
another, the Judge shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who
shall entreat for him? The sins against God are either,

1. Known sins. 2. Unknown sins.
As Psalm. 19. 12. Who can understand his errors; cleanse Psalm. 19. 12.
thou me from my secret sins: Now to apply this unto the point: if they be
secret sins against God, then it is enough to confess them unto God only,
for God only is offended, and so it is sufficient to confess them unto God:
For it is a rule of Justice, Poena non excedet culpam; the punishment shall not
exceed the fault, or go no further then the trespass. So then, if our sins
be against God only, it is enough to confess them unto God: and though the
Papists say; No hope of pardon unless we confess our secret sins unto
Priests: yet the Scriptures of God are clear against them, as Psalm. 32. Psalm
35. 2.
5. I acknowledge my sins unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I
said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgauest the
iniquity of my sin. And so the poor Publican, that went into the Temple and
knocked his breast, he confessed his sins unto God, and Iuke 18. 13. 14
said, God be merciful unto me a sinner; I tell you (says Christ) this man
departed to his house justified: and so we see it by experience in the holy
Scripture, That we should confess our sins unto God only. It is the saying
of a learned man, That we should confess our sins Chrysostom. on. Psalm. 50.
unto God, who only can best wipe away our sins; for a man is many times
ashamed to discover his secrets to his best friends, much more to a stranger
Priest: And so then (against the Papists) we see that we are not to confess
all our sin, unto any, but unto God only: As in the story of Manasses, we
see in his distress it is written, 1. Chron. 33. 12. And when he was in
affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly, before
the 1. Coron. (...). 12
God of his Fathers. So then if they be secret sins, it is enough to confess
them unto God only. Whereby you may see that the Papists opinion is false;
which inioynes a man upon pain of damnation to confess them unto a Priest,
all the Scripture being contrary unto them if rightly understood.

But yet, In one case we are bound to confess them unto Exception.
men, that is in case of distress, when we are so burdened with them, as
that we cannot rise up under so great a load, nor can find ease or comfort any
other way. In this case there is a necessity, and we should and ought
confess them unto men, as Saint James has it; Acknowledge your sins to one
another, and pray for one another: but (...). 5. 6.
yet we must take heed unto whom we make our sins known. It must be such a
one as we thinkeable to comfort us in our distresses, and resolve our doubts;
such a one as will conceal them, and pray for us in all occasions, as if it
were his own case.

Math. 8. 4. where Christ says to the Leper (Ostende te Sacerdoti) But go thy
way, show thy self to the Priest: so that every man though God heal him and
cleanse him upon his confession; yet he is also bound to show himself unto the
Priest.

Mat. 8. 4. 1.
Scripture against Christ, Mat. 8. 4. to pervert the sense of the Scripture;
for the words say not, Confitere te, Go and confess thy self to the Priest;
but (Ostende te) Show thy self to the Priest. Ostende te, quia sanatuses, Show
thy self, because thou art made whole: they do wrest the meaning thus,
Shewthy self because thou art polluted. Leuit. 14. 2.
precept of Moses, Leuit. 14. 2. where God had enjoined it. Christ sent him,
but they will have him to perform an ordinary duty.

James, Iam. 5. 16.
5. 16. Confess your faults to one another, and pray one for another. James,
is a reciprocal duty, Confess your sins to one another. James speaks of,
is only in case of necessity and distress, without examination, and freely,
and that in such a sin only, as cannot be healed by our selves. Saint James
speaks of, is by Prayer: but the healing of the Priest is by substantial
Absolution, and so the Popish confession cannot be meant here in this place.
So that this Argument stands good against them that our secret sins against
God are not of necessity to be confessed, but unto God only.

But if they be known sins against God, then it is not enough to repent of
them before God, but we are bound to repent of them before men also. So we
see the Prophet David after his fall, he did not only repent of his sin
before God, but also he made, Psalm. 51. a penitential Psalm as the Fathers
have it, to be a monument and Testimonial to the whole Church. So likewise
St. Paul, 1. Cor. 15. he says, I am not worthy to be called an Apostle,
because I did persecute the Church of God. So 1. Cor 15.
as his sin was made manifest in persecuting the Church of God, in like manner
his repentance was made manifest and known unto all. So then, this case is
clear, that known and open sins are to be confessed not only unto God, but
also unto men; that as they have knowledge of our sins, so also they may have
of our repentance, and that we are changed into newness of life, and that for
two reasons; Abimelech, Genesis Genesis 20 8.
20. 8. did tell his servants that which God had in a dream revealed unto him,
that as many as knew of his sin in taking away Abraham's wife, might know of
his repentance, because as he had done hurt by his bad example of sinning, so
he might again salve that sore by his repenting: he might have carried the
matter closely and secretly that none might have known it, but we see he
does reveal it to the end it might be known.

Second sort of sins.
The second sort of sins are against our brethren, and they are of two sorts.

1. There are some sins which one may commit against a man which do not hurt
him, or indammage him: as to think an evil thought against him, these sins
we are to confess unto God only, because he only knows them and is
offended for them.

2. Some sins again there are that do hurt them, and they do receive
damage by them of which there be two sorts:

First, some are such as we know not to be sins, and such as we have forgotten,
and cannot call to our minds to remember them; For which sins, a general
repentance or confession will serve the turn, but we must take heed that we
do not wilfully or willingly forget them: in such sins wherein a man either
in body, word or goods, does hurt his neighbor, having no ill intent toward
him, nor afterward knowing it, in this case generality will serve.

But secondly some are such sins as we do know of, and such as in which we
well understand, and remember that we have wronged our neighbor. Now if they
be such sins as we do not know of, as I said before, or be forgotten, or we
do not know to be sins; then men are not bound to confess them; for else
who could be saved, for a number of sins were committed against our brethren
which we forget, and a number of sins there are, which we do not know to be
sins against them; as 2. Sam. 21. 3 2. Sam. 21. 3.
David knew not how he had offended the Gibeonites. But if they be such sins
as one does know, these we are bound to confess not only unto God, but unto
the persons wronged also. As Christ's counsel is, Luke 17. 3. Luke 17. 3.
Take heed to your selves, if thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him;
If he repent forgive him.

The second question is: whether a man is bound upon his repentance to make
restitution of that which is taken away by injustice?

1. God. 2. Our neighbor.
And it being a rule in Justice that the penalty must stretch as far as the
fault; therefore it will follow because both God and man is offended in this
case, that we should not only repent to God, but also to men, and make
satisfaction for the hurt which we have done to them. For, It is Nature of
Repentance.
the Nature of Repentance to bring all things as near as may be unto their
former estate again. Note.
Now we know that by the sin of injustice God is offended, and our neighbor is
hurt; wherefore, by our Repentance, we reconcile our selves to God; and by our
restitution unto men, we make satisfaction for the hurt we have done them; so
that there must be restitution and satisfaction, that wherein we have indamaged
our brother: there may be addition unto his own. For if our brother have ought
against us, God will not hear us, until we be reconciled to our See Zacheus
his Practice.
brother, by restitution and satisfaction; as Christ's counsel is, Math. 7. 23.
If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, Math. 7. 23.
and there remember that thy brother has ought against thee: leave there thine
offering before the Altar, go thy way and first be reconciled to thy brother,
and then come and offer thy offering. Whereby we may see that God will not
accept of any duty which we shall do, until we be reconciled to our
brother. Thus Exodus 22. 5. God commands, Exodus 22. 5.
that If a man do hurt to a field or a vineyard, he shall recompense of the
best of the field, or of the best of the vineyard. So Nu^. 5. 7. God says in
such a case of trespass; Number. 5. 7. 8.
And they shall confess their sin which they have done; and he shall
recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and shall add unto it, a
fifth part also, and give it unto him against whom he has trespassed.

But what if a man be not able?

Soll. Then do what you can or may, 2. Cor. 8. 12.

Ob. 2. What if the parties be dead?

Soll. Then give it to the next of kin, Numb. 5. 8.

Ob. 3. What if one know none of the kindred or can find none?

Soll. Then give it to the poor, or by advice of the Minister dispose thereof.

And thus we see the sin of injustice to be a grievous sin, wherein a man is
bound to restitution, satisfaction and confession; If a man have spoken ill of
his neighbor, he must be sorry fo it, and speak well of him again. If
servants steal or purloyne any thing of their Masters, they must make it good;
confess their fault, and restore it unto them again, if ever God bring them
home to himself: So if a man shall get away his neighbors goods by injustice,
or by deceit or fraud, or cousening of him: God will not accept of such a man,
until he have made satisfaction: the like may be said in forgerie,
oppression, subornation, false witnesses and the rest, there must follow
repentance and satisfaction, or no forgiveness of sins. See then what a
great sin this of Injustice is, and what a grievous burden a man pulls upon
himself, when he has gathered together a great deal of ill gotten goods: For
when he comes to die, he is in hazard to be either a damned sinner, or a
stark beggar. And therefore it is a woeful case, when Parents put and
adventure their children upon any bad courses, not caring how, so they may
enrich them. There are a number of Usurers, which say they cannot live
otherwise, and therefore they put their stock to use to raise some profit to
themselves. But let them know that these sins be sins of injustice, and
therefore they must not only repent for them, but also they must make
restitution and satisfaction. If a man do sin against God, if he confess and
repent, God will forgive him; But if he do sin against men, he must not
only confess to God, but also unto men, and make satisfaction for the
offense: here also such are to be reproved, who at their death make Wills,
committing their souls to God, and their ill-gotten goods to their friends and
children, the high way to bring a curse upon them; let Parents beware of this
error. And so much for this third case.

LECT. X.
IIII. THE CASES OF Repentance: The case of Tears.
JOEL. 2. 12. 13. Therefore, also now, says the Lord: turn ye even to me
with all your heart, and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning:

And r^^t your heart and not your garments, etc.


HItherto we have spoken of Repentance, with some cases thereof, and some yet
remain to be spoken of: The last day we handled the Case of Confession to
men. And now in the next place because the want of tears does so perplexe many
in this great work of Repentance: The Lord as in this text and many other
places of Scripture so exhorting unto the same; suitable unto which is the
Saints practice now and in all ages: I have therefore in the next place chosen
to handle, The Case of tears The state of the question.
in Repentance; that is, whether every man or woman who truly repents them of
their sins, must and do necessarily shed tears for them? The answer whereof
(by your patience) I will lay down in five conclusions. The first Conclusion
shall be this;

A man may weep for sin, shed tears for it, and yet not truly repent;
tears be not always a true sign of true Repentance.

The reason whereof is, because the very natural man wishes well unto
himself, desires his own peace and hearts ease as much as may be. Therefore
when he apprehends the fearful judgments of God due unto him for his sin,
even the hatefulness of vile actions which he has committed, the very
conscience and horror of these things will make him many times weep, so that a
natural man may shed tears for sin, and yet not repent him of it: as we
see in Esau, Genesis 27. 34. He wept Genesis 27. 34.
for the loss of his Fathers blessing and his birthright, and yet so far
from repenting of his sin, that at that same instant, after his Fathers death
he resolved to kill his brother. So the Holy story affirms of Saul, 1. Sam.
24. 17. that when David had cut off the lap of his garment, 1. Sam 24. 17.
when he might have killed him, and when he had made his innocence known to
him; Saul he lift up his voice and wept, and made confession of his sins
before God, and yet for all this chap. 26. we see he persecuted him again,
even against his own conscience; so we see he wept for his sin and yet
never repented. He confessed he had done ill, and that David was more
righteous then he. So Mal. 2. 13. The people of Israel is Mal. 2. 13.
said to have covered the Altar of God with their tears, with weeping and
mourning, and yet for all that lived in their sins without Repentance, and
said; wherein shall we return? So it is clear, that tears are not always a
true sign of true Repentance. For the most part all the Religion of the world
is this, that if a man can bring himself so far, not only to be touched for
sin, but also to weep for it, to shed a few tears, by and by they think
themselves to be safe; yea, though they live loosely and profanely after, but
this is to build up their comfort upon a safe ground, because as we have
heard, a man may shed tears for sin, and yet not repent it: so that tears
be not always the true companions of true Repentance.

How can a poor Christian take any comfort in his Tears; If tears be not
always a true sign of Repentance.



1. He must look into the causes of them. 2. He must look into the Effect
and fruit of them.
He must look into the cause and fountain from whence they flow; whether it
be for fear of damnation and of hell torments he weeps or not, for these
may make a wicked man much to be astonished for the time, and repent of his
sin: as Act. 24. 26. so the children of Act. 24. 26. *
Israel when the Lord told them, that they should not enter into the land of
Canaan, repented of their sins, and did weep before the Lord, but the cause
was the judgments and scourge of God upon them, being chafed by the Amorites,
Deuteronomy. 1 45. so that a man may weep to Deuteronomy. 1 45.
no purpose for the judgments and punishments that follow sin; but when a
man can weep for sin, because it is sin (which indeed would bring him unto
Repentance,) because he has offended so good a God; displeased so gracious,
and so merciful a Father, done that which is profane and unseemly in his
sight, then we may have joy and comfort in our tears. So we see in the
example of the Prodigal son, Luke 15 21. he more Luke 15. 21.
lamented that he had offended so good and loving a Father then for the loss
of his money; then for all the misery which was upon him, and hardness he
had sustained; yea, I say, all this did not so much grieve him, as that he had
offended his good Father. The like we see by David, Psalm. 51. 4. says he,
Against thee only have Psalm 51. 4.
I sinned: did he sin only against God? he had also sinned against Vriah,
Barsheba, against the people, and against the peace of his own soul. Yet
above all, his greatest grief was for offending his God; a God that had dealt
so bountifully with him in his advancement, and mercifully in his preservation,
and so by the consideration of the cause, we may receive comfort in our
tears, when we consider from what motives they proceed, and principally
moving Causes.

must look unto the Effect and fruit of them, for if a man do so weep for
his sins, as that by and by he be ready to fall into, and commit the same
sins again, and that as greedily and carelessly as he did before; then it is
to be feared, that the watrie tears shed here, is but a beginning of that
everlasting weeping and mourning in hell. But if a man do so weep for sin,
as that thereby he is made more watchful over sin, more to hate it,
careful to resist it, more willing to weaken the sudden power thereof in
himself, then a man may have comfort in his tears; as it is 2. Cor. 7. 10.
11. For godly sorrow works 2. Cor 7. 10. 11.
Repentance to salvation not to be repented of, etc. For behold this that ye
have been godly sorrowful what care it has wrought in you, what clearing of
your selves, etc. So then you see there are two sorts of tears; First, Tears
of profane men, for they have their Tears too; but there is small comfort in
them, a man is never the better for such tears, they are seldom put home to
the conscience, nor is the life reformed by them, they leave no steps of
goodness, nor prints of Grace behind them. Secondly, the tears of the godly
be indeed sorrowful tears, but they are mighty and quickening (like Aqua
fortis) which make strong and lasting impressions of virtue and of grace, which
leave a seed and ^it behind to work upon their souls and conscience. Thus
much of the first Conclusion: the second is this:

Conclusion 2.

Every one that commits sin has just cause above all

This is proved; first By Reason; Secondly, By Example: for there are three
things which will make a man to shed tears:

1. For the loss of some great good. 2. The fear of some great evil. 3. The
sense and feeling of some grievous pain.
Now in all these cases, a man has cause to shed tears for sin; In regard
of the great loss that comes by sin: worldly men as we know will weep for
the loss of children, goods, lands, and such like; but all the losses of the
world are not comparable unto the loss which comes by sin; for it is neither
of children, goods, or lands, but by sin we lose the favor of God; all our
parts of that we have in Christ, heaven and happiness; yea, we fail of Gods
blessed presence for ever, and so of all losses the greatest comes by sin: So
that we have more cause to mourn for it, then for any worldly calamity or
misery whatsoever, look in the story of Micah, Judge. 18. 24. Ye have taken
away my Gods which I Judge. 18. 24.
made, and the Priest, and ye are gone away, and what have I more? and what is
this that ye say unto me, what ailest thou? Here you see that when the
soldiers had taken away Micahs Gods, he ran after them crying and Micahs
gods.
weeping, and was angry that they should ask, what ailest thou? Even so must
we, if such as he can so weep for a false God, much more have we cause to
weep and mourn, when we shall consider that our own sins have taken away
our true God from us, yea all the joy, comfort, and peace that we had in God,
and therefore above all things we have cause to shed tears and weep for our
sins.

In regard of the great and intolerable evil which comes by sin. Whereof the
final evil is Hell and damnation, which is the greatest, most insupportable
and mischievous evil of all other; because all other evils are temporary,
this eternal: We see a man is sorry when he has brought himself to
lamenesse, blindness, and mutilation of any member, and how much more then
when he has brought this upon himself, and therewith the curse of God, and
everlasting Evils procured.
damnation; pains endless and restless for ever: O how much cause therefore
has a man to mourn and lament for his sins? which bring not temporary (but
as I said) everlasting punishments; The fire that came upon Sodom lasted but
for a day: The flood that came Fire of Sodom. Flood of Noah. Genesis 41. 49.
upon the old world lasted but for a short time; the great famine of Egypt,
Genesis 41. 49. lasted but for seven years, and the captivity of Babylon lasted
but 70. years, but damnation in Hell shall be for ever and ever, no time shall
end it, no means shall finish it, no policy shall escape it.

or stomache, arm, leg, etc. but the pains of Hell are universal in every
part, in all parts at once, which must much multiply pain, sorrow, and
destruction in us.



in regard of the pains accompanying the same: which are deadly, dangerous:
For if one should wound a man in the leg, he might recover, but prick him
if it were but with a pin at the heart, and the wound proves Wounds.
deadly: So it is in wounding of the soul, every sin proves deadly, and as a
stabbe to the heart; for though woe do not presently feel it, though our
deadness and numnesse make us insensible and careless. Yet in the day of Gods
visitation, when Gods wrath shall fall upon us and open our wounds which sin
has made, then shall we roar and cry, and endure torment enough: thus if
we have cause to weep for any thing, we have cause to weep for our sins
that strike so deep to our consciences and souls. Note.
Thus we have again to bewail the hardness of our hearts, that in bodily
cures can away with the cutting of a limb, breaking of an arm or leg, and
yet cannot away with the searching and lancing of our consciences.

Thus as it is by Reason, so the necessity of mourning for sin is proved by
Example, for there was none of the holy men of God but they have wept for
sin, and we have certainly as much and more cause to weep then they had;
and yet how far short do we come of this duty? shall I name David, Daniel,
Peter, and other holy men of God? how fervent was holy Luther in mourning and
weeping for his sins? had David cause to weep abundantly and water his couch
with tears, and have not we cause much more? Had Peter cause to lament his
fall bitterly? and have not we more falls then he had? Had Daniel cause to
bewail his many trespasses, and are not we guilty of many more iniquities?
shall Mary Magdalen weep, and weep for sin in a manner a river of tears,
and have we no cause or necessity to weep for our many transgressions? O if
we could search our sinful and corrupt lives, and see how we have offended
our God, we could not choose but weep for our sins: what not shed tears
for sin, when we see our Savior shed blood in the Garden for our sins, and
not for any of his; he being without sin, but we are hard-hearted and never
think upon our Redemption: Nor shed a tear for that which wrought blood out
of Christ's body. O wonderful and lamentable, what a pitious thing is this,
that we cannot let fall a drop of water for sin, when he poured out
abundance of his blood for the same; yea, he did sweat it out for grief and
anguish; a sign of small or no sorrow in us; when we cannot wring out a few
tears, much less pour out water before the Lord, as his people sometime did
for their sins, 1. Sam. 7. 6. 1. Sam 7. 6.
Thus much of the second Conclusion; The third is this:

Conclusion 3.

There is never a man living that is able to shed tears for every sin he
does commit.

Every sin it is certain deserves tears, yea, and bitter tears too; for
every sin is committed against God a holy Father; yea, Holiness it self and
an infinite Majesty; now we know it is no small matter to offend God, nor no
great enforcement to shed tears for our sins, and yet we are hardly brought
to weep for one sin of ten thousand: It is so in the general, though it be
true that there be some of more feeling and tender consciences then others: as
it is said of St. Hierome, that he wept for sin, and was so tenderly
affected, as if he had killed a man; but o that it were so with us; that we
could attain to this tenderness of heart: The hindrances and impediments I
take to be two:

1. Blindness in Judgment. 2. Hardness of heart.
Mal. 1 when they were reproved of their sins, yet they say, wherein have we
sinned? or if men know sin to be sin, yet they mistake; they think great
sins are but petty ones; and small ones, they esteem to be nothing at all,
not worth the grieuing at, because for the present they pain not: as a man
having a bleeding wound he sees not; passes it Bleeding wound.
over until he faints: it proouing deadly if not stopped and cured.

Hardness of heart, which (for all the Regenerate are in part sanctified) we
are subject unto, therefore though some in Repentance bring forth tears; yet a
number for their lives cannot shed any one tear for sin, until God by an
especial work convert and turn the Heart unto him, by an especial operation
of his blessed Spirit and power of Grace. The want of this tenderness we see
made the Prophet in the name of the Church cry out, Isa. 63. 17. O Lord why
have thou made us to erre^ from thy ways, and hardened Isa. 6^. 7.
our hearts from thy fear? Yet I must needs say, there is great difference
betwixt that hardness of heart in the godly, and in the wicked: for that of the
former is sensible, full of pain, grief, sorrow, mourning yea there is a
particular sorrow for that hardness felt, besides that of other sins: but
that which is in the wicked is insensible, they are never thoroughly touched or
affected with a feeling of their sins, and so never weep or sorrow for them.
The fourth Conclusion is,

Conclus. 4.

That a man may truly repent him of his sins, though he cannot weep or shed
a tear for them.

Which I prove thus, They that can mourn for their sins, and in compunction
of soul make use of the death and passion of Christ, may truly repent: but a
man may mourn for his sin and do thus, and yet never shed a tear; therefore
a man may truly repent without shedding of tears, for tears are not always a
sign of true repentance. As we see Acts 2. 37. where it is said those Converts
Act 2. 37.
were pricked in their hearts, not pricked in their eyes; for a man's heart may
be pricked and overwhelmed with grief, and yet not weep or shed any tears.
So we see the Publican, Luke 18. He could not weep, but he was humbled and
cast down in the sense and feeling of his sins; Lord (says he) be merciful
to me a sinner. So in like manner, we do not read that the Thief upon the
Cross did weep or shed any tears, yet he confessed his sins, and was
inwardly grieved for them. So we see a man may truly repent who sheddeth no
tears. For as a Wine vessel without vent is ready to burst; so the less
Vine-vessell.
weeping, many times the greater is the sorrow, and the heart so much the more
ouerburthened. Tears are as a vent, which when they are not, and the heart
this way allayed and eased, the inward grief is so much the more excessive and
great. The fifth Conclusion is:

Conclus. 5.

That there is hardly any man living, that has truly felt the work of Grace
in himself, but at one time or other, if God let him live any time, has or
shall in some measure shed tears for his sins. Ever excepting those men whom
their natural hard and dry temper of their eyes disableth perpetually from
all tears: (...).

This Conclusion I will first open, and then in time confirm it: yet assure
your selves of this, That every one cannot weep in their repentance and first
Calling, until it please God to infuse more grace, and smite the heart. Yet
though at first they do not, wait a while, and in continuance of time, or when
God sends some great affliction or judgment upon them, you shall see them come
to tears, and weep for their sins. As a man that is stricken One stricken
with a sword.
with a sword, the blood does not always by and by follow; So it is with the
smitten conscience of a wounded sinner; there is fear, astonishment, and
amazement many times, before weeping; and yet afterward tears may come
abundantly, as blood after a wound.

But to my promise now, which was, first, To open the Conclusion: secondly, To
explain it. First then I say, That hardly is there any man living, but he has
or shall shed tears for sin, if God have a purpose to save him: Therefore
howsoever one may go away at the first rejoicing, like Lydia at her first
conversion; and like the Lydia. Eunucb.
Eunuch in the Acts: yet at one time or other they shall weep and mourn for
their sins: though I would have you remember, that I do not exclude any from
the hope of Heaven, and state of true penitencie, that shed no tears for sin;
for so I have showed the case may be, though seldom heard of. David says,
Psalm 37. 25. I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the
righteous for saken, nor their seed begging bread: And yet poor Lazarus died a
beggar, and was carried by the hands of the Angels into Abraham's bosom: Now
David's meaning is, not that there was none of the righteous, David's Experience.
or of their seed that did beg their bread, but that it was a rare thing,
that he had not seen it in his days, or in an Age: So we may say of this
point; It may be a man may be truly converted, and yet never shed a tear
in his life: but it is a rare case, no ordinary thing, it is that which
seldom falls out one of a thousand, but that at one time or other they are so
pressed with their sins.

Zach. 12. 10. And I will pour upon Za^k. 12. 10.
the house of David, and upon the Inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of Grace
and supplication, and they shall weep, etc. That is, they shall mourn and
lament as a man that mourns for his own sins; nature may make a man mourn
for the loss of his children, friends, goods, wife and such like, but it is
only the Spirit of God, of Grace that can make a man shed tears for his
sins, so that a man may be a natural man, an unregenerate man, an
unconverted man, and never shed a tear for his sins all his life long,
though he be a most wicked liver. But if the Spirit of Grace once work upon
his heart, hardly but at one time or other, his heart will melt and lament that
he has offended God.

his sins, because no man truly converted can think of his sins with
pleasure but with grief. Job says thou make me to possess the sins of my
youth; so we may be free and have little sorrow and few or no tears for
sin at first, and yet this case of compassion may affect us in our riper age,
or old age, or in the time of sickness and death, at which time we may come
in bitterness of soul to bewail them.

Act. 8. 39. and Lydia, Act. Act. 8. 39. Act. 16. 14.
16. 14. when God opens their hearts, absenting matter of terror, and
representing full matter of joy, depart away at first rejoicing, not mourning
as others: So that I say the case is different in this case, according to the
representation and divine impression upon the soul of joy or terror in the
present apprehension; or according to the former guiltiness of the party
converted: but this is most sure if we belong to the Lord, at one time or
other, we shall weep and mourn for sins of our selves and others. See
Psalm, 25. 7. says David, Remember not O Psalm. 25. 7. 2. King. 22. 10.
Lord the sins of my youth. And 2. King. 22. 10. you shall find how much
good Josiah was affected with the sins of the time, when Helkiah the Priest
delivered him a book whereby he apprehended how the people had offended God,
so that whosoever of Gods children has not yet felt conversion thoroughly, he
shall feel it before this life leave him: as I showed formerly, a wound Wound.
with a sword makes but a white stroke at first; but within a while the blood
issues abundantly: So every one does not by and by bleed upon his first
conversion, and feeling of sin, when he is smitten by the Law: but tarry
awhile till some further working upon his heart, and you shall see vnconcealed
sorrow and tears issue forth amain.

Now the Reason of this I think is,

Why some men mourn, and some do not, but rejoice at their first conversion;
because it is with the motions of the mind, as it is with the motions of
compounded bodies, Elements predominate tending still toward their proper orb
or place agreeable unto them. So at that time of conversion, look what the
soul is most possessed with at that time, thither it is carried. As fill a
bladder A Bladder with wind.
with wind and throw it to the ground, it will not lie there but bend upwards
to the air, because it is filled with air; but fill it with earth, and it
will fall and lie on the earth, because of the earth that fills it: and our
bodies being earthly fall to the earth again: So it is in Cause of fear or
joy.
the mind of a man at his first conversion, if he apprehend the mercy of God
in Christ, more then the fearful judgments of God for sin, then he is
carried with comfort, but on the other side apprehending judgments most, then
he is cast down and discouraged.

Fifthly I say, all that are truly converted shall shed tears at one time or
other, though not in a like measure, for some shed tears in a more abundant
manner, as Mary Magdalen who sat at Christ's feet and washed them with her
tears, Luke 7. So of Peter, Math. 26. who went Luk 7.
out and wept bitterly: and of David, Psalm. 6. who watered his couch with
tears: whom though all cannot follow, yet all must wish to imitate in true
sorrow for sin, in one measure or other; for it is well observed of a learned
man that a man may let out the corruption of a byle, Byle let out.
as well out of a little hole as out of a great one: as one may know that there
is life in a man, as well by the stirring Life by stirring.
and wagging of a finger, as of the whole hand: so may the truth of Repentance
as well be discerned by a few tears as a great many. Thus we have seen the
meaning of the conclusion. That there be very few who are truly converted, if
they continue any time after conversion but will shed tears for their sins
at one time or other, in one measure or other. Now I come to confirm it
diversely;

1. By Reason. 2. By Authority. 3. By Example.
1 By Reason proved.
First by Reason thus, hardly is there any man living be he never so stout
hearted, and composed in himself, but there is one thing or other that will
make him weep though he set never so good a face on the matter, the loss of
wife, husband, children, or the unkindness of friends, or some worldly
calamity; but in those that be truly converted, the greatest grief of all
is the grief for sin, all other griefs whatsoever are nothing so great or
sensible; If this be thoroughly apprehended; nothing so works on the heart of
a renewed man, as the heavy and sad remembrance of sins past, whereby he
has offended God, and grieved him to whom he owes more service and duty then
to all the world besides. And so seeing there is not any man living, but some
extreamitie will make him weep, and the greatest extremity in any man's
conscience truly considered is sin, or for sin, hardly is there any man
living but at one time or other the conscience of his sins will make him
weep and draw tears from him.

2 By Authority.
Secondly, By Authority thus, Psalm. 126. 5. They that sow in tears shall reap
in joy. Ierem. 50. 4. Then and in those days and at that time shall the
children of Israel come, they and the children of Judah going and weeping they
shall go and seeks the Lord their God. So Revel. 21. 4. it is promised, And
God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, not only the tears which they
have shed in regard of their misery, but also those shed in regard of their
sins: so it is most sure, that those who are humbled and shed tears for any
thing, will especially mourn and weep for sin.

3 By Example.
Thirdly, By Example of other holy people that have been before us, they that
could hardly weep for all the things in the world did yet weep for their
sins; David a soldier, and so by consequence a stout-hearted man, much
acquainted with blood, yet his sins made him shed abundance of tears, Psalm. 6.
6. and so he adds ver. 8. He Psalm. 6. 6.
has heard the voice of my weeping: And so Mary Magdalen sat her down at the
feet of Jesus, and washed them with her tears, Luke 7. which though it be no
strange thing for a woman to weep, yet for such a woman to weep, a Lady, a
gallant altogether, set upon her pleasures, bravery and delights, it was as
strange a thing as might be. The like may be said of the children of Israel, a
proud insolent hard-hearted people, such as would not easily melt, yet when the
Angel, Judge. 2. 4. came and set their sins Judge. 2. 4.
before them, the text says, That they lift up their voice and wept: and in
another case of sorrow, 1. Sam 7. 6. we Judge. 2. 4. 1. Sam. 7. 6.
read, They poured out water before the Lord: and therefore seeing such who of
all others were most unlikely to weep, did shed tears for their sins, being
pricked in conscience, what shall we think of others a great deal more
tenderhearted; what have they done in secret before God? Thus the conclusion
is made good.

Use.
Oh then think of this ye merry people of the world, you that pass your
days in joy and pleasure, that if the best of Gods people and servants at one
time or other, have and must shed tears and weep for their sins; O how
great cause have you to lay aside your meriments, to bid farewell to your
sports, and to come down into dust and ashes, and there in the bitterness of
your souls mournfully and heavily to lament your sins before the Lord; It is
time that you exclaim and say, Peccatum est causa tristitiae and doloris;
Sin will cause sorrow, fear and lamentation, either in earth or in hell: and
so better weep and mourn for our sins on earth, where you may have comfort
and pardon, ease and forgiveness, then in hell where you shall have a
continual death, and yet a living torture: Ibi erit fletus and assiduus
terror: they be Christ's own words as you know, Luke 13. 28. Luke 13. 28.
When they shall see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the Prophets and Saints
in heaven, and themselves shut out of d^ores: whilst they shall see other
penitent sinners go to heaven, and themselves meanetime tormented in hell:
Others go to pleasure, whilst these go to pain; others to be carried to
eternal life, whilst these go down to eternal death. And so beloved of the
Lord, judge your selves for your sins, that God may not judge you: condemn
your selves, and let your present tears prevent those heavy endless tears to
come upon you hereafter. And thus, let us all go forth with Christ into the
Garden: and let us not sleep there as his Disciples did, but seeing Christ
fell flat under the burden of our sins; let us fall down by him in
consideration of our manifold offenses; where though we cannot shed blood as
he did, yet let us endeavor and pray to God that we may shed tears of
repentance: Yea as Christ in the days Heb. 5. 7.
of his flesh did offer up strong cries and tears with supplications and
prayers unto him who was able to save him from death; so let us do, and let us
be restless, never to give over our suit, until we hear that comfortable
voice come unto us: Son be of good cheer, thy sins are pardoned, thy soul
shall be saved; thy prayers and tears are come up in remembrance before God.
Thus much of the Case of Tears.

LECT. XI.
V. THE CASE OF comfort in death in Repentance.
NVM. 23, 10. Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be
like his.
AS we have a care to live to the Lord, so we must have a care to die to the
Lord also. For as it is Romans 14. 7. 8. Romans 14. 7.
None of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself, for whether we
live, we live unto the Lord, or whether we die, we die unto the Lord;
whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lords. Accordingly is that
ravished speech of Balaam here in my text; Let me Number. 23. 10.
die the death of the Righteous, and let my last end be like his. Which words,
do especially imply these three thing:

1. That there is a death of the righteous, that they must die as well as
others. 2. That the death of the righteous i^ far different from the death of
the wicked. 3. That every man must desire to die as the righteous die.
That is in peace of a good conscience, and feeling of the promises and
comforts of God made in Jesus Christ, so that these words show us that there is
great cause for us to inquire after. The case of Repentance we last spoke of,
Whether every one that has truly repented can show himself comfortable and
heavenly minded at the hour of Death? Now the answer I will lay down in two
points:

1. That a man may truly repent, and yet depart out of this world with little
or no comfort at the hour of death. 2. That there is nevertheless a very
hopeful and likely way, whereby true penitents may come boldly to die with
comfort, if they do not neglect the means.
Concerning the first point, I say a man may truly repent him of his sins,
and yet show little or no comfort at the day of death. Yea the truth is, that
the greatest part of Gods people as they live well, so they die well and
comfortably: as we see Steven did, Acts 7. 16. He Steuens sight.
saw a heavenly vision, heaven opened, and Christ standing at his right hand
ready to help him, and even so for the most in the day of death, the people
of God see heavenly visions: So Jacob went down to Egypt, and Genesis 49. 33.
died there comfortably and in peace: The like we read of Joseph, who
commanded his bones to be removed, Genesis 50. 25.
at their departure from Egypt. So David, Moses, and other of the Saints died,
and had honorable burial in the peace of a good conscience. This made Balaam
say, O that I might die the death of the righteous, and that my last end might
be like his: He would not live the life of the Saints, but he would gladly
have so died: it was too strict, too precise a way for a natural man like him:
too much against the current and stream of the world, though he would have
dyed like the righteous, because he knew the difference was great betwixt
their death and that of wicked men. So it is written, Heb. 11. 13. of Heb. 11.
15.
the Fathers of the faithful; They all died in faith, not all of lingering
sicknesses, nor they died not all in their beds, nor amongst their friends, in
bodily honor and pomp which may be taken away and debarred men to i^ioy: but
in faith, in peace of conscience, in hope of heaven, in the comfortable
application of the promises of Gods love, in assurance of the pardon of sin.
So as I say, usually and ordinarily, the people of God live in this world with
comfort, and depart out of this world as old Simeon did when he had gotten
Christ into his arms, Luke 2. Yet sometimes it falls out by the wise
dispensation Luke 2.
of God that through their own default, the most faithful and believing men
have very little comfort, and poor fruits of their faith when they come to
die, but either die without feeling (which is grievous) or which is more
fearful with fear and horror; which not only daily experience confirms,
but Scripture also: as Eccles. 8. 9. All things come alike to all: there is one
event Eccles. 8. 9.
to the righteous and to the unrighteous, to the good and the bad, to the pure
and the polluted, to him that sacrifices and to him that sacrifices not, etc.
the meaning of which place is, that all worldly things fall alike to all with
the same condition and time, to the wicked as well as the good, to the Just, as
to the unjust. Now if all things fall alike in their lives, then may some men
say, it may be also alike in their deaths, and so we may not by and by
condemn a man that shows little comfort at his death; Note.
but if his life have been good, he having walked in the fear of God, showed
signs of his conversion, we are to judge of him according to the whole course
of his life, and not according to that one instance of his death: for as a man
that sees his fellow sit upon a high rock a great One on a Rock.
way from him, though he stir neither hand nor foot, nor show any motion of
life, yet he knows there is life in him, because he sits upright; there was
life in him when he left him; and no body came since to take away his life; so
in this case it is with a Christian, though we see no motion or sign of
spiritual life at the instant, yet because we knew him when he had the life
of God, and grace, and no body since could take it from him, it cannot be, we
may conclude, but that it remains still with him; as 1. John. 3. 9. it is
said, Whosoever is borne of God (...). John. 3 9.
does not commit sin, for his seed remains in him, neither can he sin
because he is borne of God. The godly in this case are said not to sin,
because they are preserved from sinning totally or finally; a holy seed
remains in them which breaks forth into repentance for all and Psalm. 32 1.
the least sins; and because the Lord imputes not their sins unto them; so
as they shall do nothing which shall impeach their salvation: So that if a man
have lived well, we having seen the effects of Gods holy Spirit in him, we
are not by and by to condemn him, though he express and feel small or no
comfort when he comes to die.

3 Causes why Gods people die without comfort,
Now there be three Causes* why the people of God, or a particular Christian
may die with little or no comfort, feeling of Gods favor; and yet have truly
repented.

1. The cause may be in nature, and then it is either by reason of 1. The
Complexion, or 2. By Reason of the Extremity of the Disease.
2. For neglect of Grace. 3. Because of their indisposition at the time of
Death.
1 Cause of want of comfort in Death.
These be the three causes why many of Gods people find little comfort in the
hour of death: First, by reason of their complexion, for grace does never
abolish nature, but only tempers and mortifies it. Indeed the nature of Grace
is to abolish sinful affection in man, but natural affections it abolishes
not, only orders and keeps them within bounds and measure; as we see in the
two Kine who carried the Arc, there was a natural affection Kine carrying the
Arc.
in them which made them low as they went, 1. Sam. 16. 12. and there was also a
power of God seen ouermastering nature, which made them carry the Arc unto
the place which God had appointed, thus Grace orders only, but destroys not
nature, it qualifies and directs it, making it a servant in all things. So
observe of what constitution a man is before Regeneration, and you shall find
him of the same after conversion: If melancholy before, he will be
melancholy after: if chollericke, the same after. Hence it is that the very
best men may show a great deal of difference betwixt what they were in life,
and in the time of death: for if a man be chollericke by nature, if formerly
he have been hasty and rash, this man though a sanctified man, and the dear
child of God, may yet (unless a great deal of grace with strength of
judgment ouermaster nature) show much impatiencie, touchinesse, way wardnesse
when he comes to die. So if a man have been of a melancholy disposition, of
a sad speech; or few words in his life, though excellent in grace, this man if
not ouermastered by grace, for his life is not able to show himself cheerful
and comfortable when he comes to die. On the other side, if a man be of a
sanguine complexion, and so by consequence light and merry; this man although
he have been a vilde and a loose liver, yet he may show himself comfortable
at the day of death, when yet this comfort may be not a work of grace but of
mere nature. Thus when we see a man distrust himself in the day of death,
we may set our selves from his own disposition to comfort him; for in some
complexions, one may come to die comfortably, though one want grace, and in
some there may be a lumpishnesse and discomfort, and yet have a warrantable
end: Therefore if we would judge rightly of any at the day of death, we must
consider of what complexion they are, and so deal iudiciously with our
comforts and threatenings. As if we pour a glass of wine amongst Wine.
wine, it tastes only of wine, but if we pour it into a glass of water,
then though the wine be predominant, yet there will be a tange and taste of
water; even so when the grace of God is infused into our hearts, though that
be predominant, yet there will be a tange and taste of nature in this life:
which is one cause why Gods children die sometimes uncomfortably.

2 Cause why some Saints die uncomfortably. Blow on the head.
Secondly, another reason in Nature may be, Because of the violence of the
Disease; for there be some diseases in nature which work more furiously upon
the spirits then others do, as a man having a great blow upon the head, may
be so stonied and amazed with the same, that for the same time he may not
know what he speaks or does: even so a holy man may be so diseased for the
time, and distressed with the extremity of his pain, that he may break
forth into rage and passion, he knows not what: as it is said of Moses,
Psalm. 106. 33. That they did Psalm. 106. 33.
vex his spirit and provoked him; so that he spoke unadvisedly with his
lips. So David says of himself, Psalm. Psalm 31. 22.
31. 22. For I said in mine haste I am cut off from before thine eyes, etc. So
that through extremity and vehemency of passion, a good man may break out
into things unseemly, all which tends to this, that a good Christian may die
of so strange a disease, of the Flux, burning Ague, Stone, Conuul^ion, when
either the choler shooting up into the head, or the disease working furiously
upon the tender vital parts, the party may die strangely: he may talk idly,
crieout through the extremity of his pain; he may have his face and his
mouth pulled awry, etc. and yet for all this be the dear child of God, and
undoubtedly saved. So one may die of an Apoplexy or dead Palsy, in which case
a man shall have all his senses benumbed so, as he may die like a block
without show of judgment or reason, and yet for all this be in a blessed
state, because though the state of his body be changed, yet the state of his
mind and soul remains untouched.

Yet I do not maintain so saying, as if all who died Exception.
of these diseases died without comfort; or that one may not die comfortably
being thus visited; yes it is most clear, that if a man be not wanting to
himself, and cast away the helps which God gives him; he may die with
comfort of whatsoever sickness he dies of. For of all deaths the most
extremely afflictiue is by fire, this is accounted the sharpest and sorest of
all bodily deaths, and yet we see many of the Martyrs have showed themselves
very joyful and comfortable even in the very flames. The reason whereof is
this; The power of grace is infinitely greater then the power of nature: as 1.
John 4. 4. Greater 1. John 4 4.
is he that is in you, then he that is in the world: as if he should say,
the power of nature is the spirit of the creature, but the power of Grace is by
the Spirit of God: now the spirit of God being greater then any created spirit
whatsoever, it comes to pass that the power of Grace brings the power of
Nature unto subjection, and ouertopping those spirits and senses works
exceeding comfort, even in the hour of death: as we see Contrary winds.
when contrary winds blow upon a Ship, that which is the strongest carries
the ship away: So because there is both nature and grace in us, and both blow
upon the ship, that is, work upon our souls, in this conflict, that which is
the strongest, working most effectually, prevails at the hour of death;
carrying the soul with it.

The second general cause of want of comfort in the hour of death
The second General Cause of want of comfort in the day of death is, The decay
of Grace; for many times the people of God are negligent, grow secure, omit
the means of growing in grace, grow loose, are not careful to answer that
expectation which is had of them, leave off diligence in hearing the Word, and
practice of holy duties: quench the good spirit with following vain delights,
give way unto temptations, suffering them to take hold upon them; thus they
break out some one way, and some another, whereby it comes to pass, that it
is the good pleasure of God to correct this looseness (though they think to
shelter themselves under the Almighty as formerly) but they cannot do it; we
see when Sampson Judge. 1^. 20.
had grown loose in his life, having played the wanton and gone a whooring
from God; when after this the Philistims came upon him, he thought to have
done as Sampsons intent.
at other times, but for his life he could not, for his strength was departed
from him: thus when some of Gods people run out in their lives, and venture
on sin, many times they smart for it at their deaths, ere the conflict with
conscience be overcome, and peace in the assurance of the forgiveness of
sins be settled: So 1. Cor. 11. 30. the Apostle shows them, For this cause
many are 1. Cor. 11. 30.
weak and sick amongst you, and many sleep; so that often times the cause of
little comfort in death, is by reason that men live loosely and carelessly when
they be well. So S. Paul says, 1. Cor. 15. 56. The sting of death is sin, and
the 1. Cor. 15. 56.
strength of sin is the Law; It is sin that makes the sting of death to be
so grievous, painful, and bitter unto us: so that is plain, the more loosely
a man lives, the more licentiously he gives himself over to the world, the
more will death grate and sting him when he comes to die. Therefore if a man
would lessen his own pains in the day of death, he must look to lessen his
own sin in his life; because Death in death has no sting but by the work of
sin. If a man have an apparent hot burning Fever, the more he drinks hot
Wines, and feeds Burning Fever.
on fiery spices, the stronger and more violent must his fitts be; where by
the contrary, the more sober and temperate he is in diet, the weaker still
will his fittes be; even so it is in death: Death is like a powerful fit of
an Ague, if a man distemper himself before death, and live loosely and
licentiously, death will shake every joint of him with mighty terrors, and
threaten to bring him to the King of terrors, but if a man be wise to weaken
death by Repentance, Humiliation, holy prayer to God; then though death may
come, yet the fury and strength of it shall be much abated: and so we may
have comfort in the hour of death, if we be careful to watch over our lives.

3 General cause of our want of comfort in Death.
The Third general Reason is, because of our indisposition at the hour of
Death, or in Death, because men do not then strive with themselves to stir
up their Faith, Zeal, and the graces of God in them, and prepare themselves
with a good conscience to die; for a man may have Faith and Repentance, and
other graces of God in him, and yet because he does not stir up those graces
in him, he may die with little comfort. A man in this case is like wasting
coals covered over with ashes, which Dead coals.
must be stirred, or else they will die suddenly; therefore when a man comes
to die, he must stir up his faith, hope, repentance, patience, care, love,
and all the graces of the spirit: even as old Jacob, Genesis 49. vlt. when he
Genesis 49. vlt.
came to die, did rear up himself, leaned on his staff, and worshipped God,
though an old decrepid man, and bedrid, yet he gat him up upon his knees,
turned himself, and renewed his repentance, so must a Christian man do at the
time of death, stir up himself and prepare to Humiliation and to die in the
Lord, lest they want comfort in death, which otherwise they might attain to.
So we see good Stephen amongst a shoure of Act. 7 60.
stones that brayned him, yet lift up his eyes to heaven, so as he made all
his persecutors amazed at his comfortable vision, and was not here a man
prepared to die? Therefore let us study and pray in this case, that God would
help us to rouse up our selves against that time.

Hithert^ have we so proceeded in this Case of comfort in Death, that we have
brought it thus far; that a man may truly repent, and yet by occasions die
with small comfort.

Now come we to the next point, the most obseruable of all the rest; namely
that

There is a hopeful and likely way whereby a man may come to die with comfort,
if he will not be wanting to himself, and neglect th^se means and helps
which God affoords him.

Now in this case there are two things to be declared unto you:

1. That there is such a way. 2. What that way is?
1 Ground that we die comfortably.
For the ground of the first I assume this, That a Christian man may be so
fortified and composed in himself by the power of grace; that whatsoever
sorrows come in death, they shall be joyfully welcome unto him. See this
composed estate of the Saints well set forth, Psalm. 37. 37. Mark the perfect
man, and behold the upright, for the Psalm 37. 37.
end of that man is peace. So in the Hebrews it is said of the Fathers, They
were racked, stoned, hewn asunder, and would not be delivered, that they
might receive a better (...). 11, 35. 36. 37.
Resurrection. So the Apostle says of himself, Act. 21. Act. 21. 1^.
13. What do ye mean to weep and break my heart, for I am ready not to be
bound nely, but even to die at Jerusalem for the Name of the Lord Jesus. So
he shows, Romans 8. 36. 37. As it is written, for thy sake are we killed Romans
8. 36.
all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter, etc. Thus you
see a Christian may be so composed in himself, that whenever death comes,
it shall not move him from that comfort and sweet apprehension he has in God.
So Maccab. 7. 5. 6. the mother Maccab. 7. 5. 6. 7.
and her children uttered these speeches when they came to die; They exhorted
one another with the mother to die manfully, and said. The Lord God looks
upon us, and in truth has comfort in us, etc. Another said, Thou like a fury
take us out of this life, but the King of the world shall raise us up. The
third said, being commanded to put forth his tongue, These have I from heaven,
but for his laws I despise them. And so the three children in Daniel 3. 7.
when a most exquisite death was set before them, they answered the King; O
Nabuchadnezzar we Dan. 3. 7.
are not fearful to answer thee in this matter; our God is able to deliver
us, but if not, we will never swerue from the holy laws which he has given
us: So that we see plainly by the worthy examples of these holy men, that a
man may be so fortified and strengthened with the Spirit of Grace, that
whatsoever death come, and whenever, it shall not take away his heavenly
comfort and peace. Very profane men can say, that delectation will Arist lib.
7. c. vlt.
take away the sense and feeling of any pain, because in g^efe and pains
there are two things which concern, first, Nocivum, a thing hateful to nature
and all the properties thereof. Secondly Perceptio Nocivi, a sensible feeling
and perceiving of that which is hurtful to nature; Now something may be
hurtful to nature, when yet delectation more rauishing with the delight of
another object, this hurt may be insensible, not complained of at least: As a
man being asleep, there may be something One asleep.
hurtful to nature, and yet he has no sense and feeling of it. So Thomas
Aquinas on Act. 4. says that Aquin 12. q. ^8 on act. 4.
the feeling and apprehension of Gods love may be so great in a man, that it
may make him rejoice in his spirit, as resolved against all mischief and
affliction whatsoever which is cast upon him. As James 1. 2. Count it exceeding
James 1. 2.
joy when you fall into diverse tentations, etc. so that one may have joy even
in dangerous trialls and temptations, so it is reported of a holy Martyr in the
Primitive Church, that when he walked upon the hot burning coals barefooted
uttered these words, O I walk upon these hot burning coals as if I walked
upon a bed of Roses, his delight in God, and a higher, mightier apprehension
carrying away the more sensitive powers of the soul, made that he felt no
pain; Or who knows but the violence of the fire might be aswaged, as in the
case of the three Children.

Now if a Christian may die thus comfortably in burning flames, in the greatest
extremity that can be, then it is more easy with divine assistance to
overcome the lesser tentations; for if a heart be sanctified by the power of
Gods grace, settled, composed in it self, there is no doubt but that he may
die in peace with heavenly comfort, though he be in perplexity upon his sick
bed. Thus it is clear, there is a very probable way, for a man to die in
comfort. If a man as I have showed before, fall into the hands of thieves, and
be robbed and spoiled of all his Man robbed.
goods; yea, left naked and wounded in a wilderness, ye^ if he have one jewel
of great value undiscovered, or in some sure friends hand, that at last he
hopes to enjoy and possess the same: his grief, sorrow and vexation for his
wounds are quickly forgot and passed over, the comfort of that he expects and
hopes for, ouercomming the present affliction. So is it with the children of
God, deprived and robbed of all worldly wealth, pleasures and preferment, vexed
and tormented with diseases, griefs, tortures, persecutions; yea, and death it
self. The hope of eternal life affoords them such comfort, with the
appurtenances thereof, that all the rest is either overcome, or ouerpassed
quickly. Yet in this case he will say, Lord I thank thee I have my jewel
still, sickness has taken away my strength, and afflictions my ease; thieves
q. d.
have taken away my goods: but Lord I thank thee I have thee still: all these
things have not taken God from me, nor Christ, nor the hope of Heaven, nor the
protection of Angels, the intercession of my Savior, the peace of conscience,
and the like; thus in this case a man's joy remains still.





1. A constant continual Preparation at all times for Death. 2. A holy
disposition when we come to die.
If these things be practiced, A preparation to die, and a sanctified heart at
the hour of death: it is sure and certain, we shall die happily and well,
whatsoever disease we die of.

1 A Preparation to death.
First therefore, there must be a preparation to death, for a man shall hardly
die well, if he do not prepare for death John 19. 41. Joseph of Arimathea.
before death come: as it is written of Joseph of Arimathea, Ioh. 19. 41. that
he made a tomb in his garden, and why in the garden, that in the midst of all
his pleasures and delights, he might remember death, and so prepare himself
for it: even so must the rest of Gods people do, prepare for death before it
come. We read that when the people of God were to celebrate the Passover,
Exodus 12. 11. the Exodus 12. 11.
text says; And thus ye shall eat it, with your loins girded, your shoes on
your feet, and your staff in your hand, and ye shall eat it in haste, etc.
And why was this? that the people might be ready to pass our of Egypt
whenever Passover.
God should call them unto it. Even so must every man prepare himself for
death, get his staff into his hand, have his loins girded, his shoes upon his
feet, that he may be ready to depart out of this world, when God shall appoint
him; but such is our corruption that a number have a care only to live in
iollity, neglecting altogether preparation for the day of death, how to lay
themselves down in rest and peace of conscience at that time.

3 Reasons to prepare for Death.
Now there be Three reasons that may move a man to prepare himself for the day
of death; Uncertain I say, both in regard of time, place, manner, for though
we all know that we must die, that no man can escape or avoid it: yet are
these other circumstances of our death only known unto God. Wherefore because
nothing more certain then that we must die, and nothing so uncertain as
Time, Place, and Manner; it stands us in hand always to be prepared for it,
doing and ordering of our affairs betimes, as good old Isaac said in this case
to his son Esau, Genesis 27. 1. 2. Genesis 27. 1. 2.
Behold now I am old, and know not the day of my Death, come therefore dress
me venison, etc. That my soul may bless thee before I dye. Even so must we
do, order all matters wisely, exhort one another dailly whilst it is called
to day: do what good we can; repent us of our sins, delay no good we are
able to do to our selves or others, saying to friends, children and
acquaintance, o my time is uncertain, therefore remember this and this, do
this and this, etc. Thus must we prepare for death, there is none amongst us I
know, but if he had an intent to build a house, would surely make preparation
for it House building.
before hand, as Timber, brick, mortar, tyles, with other necessaries: So
seeing we are to make sure for our selves an eternal house not made with
hands, ler us be careful to furnish our selves, to fit our selves for it, by
earnest prayer, faith, patience, obedience, etc. because as I said we are
uncertain of the time, whether to day or to morrow, young or old, this year
or the next; whether in the day or the night; whether in the house or the
field; whether amongst our friends or enemies: whether of a lingering or a
sudden, a mild or a torturing disease: by land or water: by sword or famine,
or pestilence, all is I say uncertain: therefore we must prepare for death,
in regard of the certain uncertainty thereof.

because we can die but once: and that which can but once be done, had need
to be well done. So the Author to the Hebrews says, Heb. 9. 27. It is
appointed for men once to Heb. 9. 27.
die, and after that comes judgment. So because we can die but once, we
should be very careful to do it well, seeing if it be ^ll done, it can never
be mended again. In all other things if a man do amiss at first, he may
repair it afterward, but only in this matter of death, there is no
amendment, no redemption afterward. If a man shoot an arrow at a mark, if in
the first aim, you tell Arrow shot.
him what his fault was; that he is over, or under, or wide, he may mend it
the next time, or the next after that; but in death it is not so, once amiss
and ever undone: therefore be careful to die well, seeing it is but once to
be done.

The remediless state after Death, for look how death leaves a man, so shall
judgment find him. As long as a man is alive here upon earth, there is hope
that he may be converted, repent of his sins, and be brought before the throne
of Grace, but if a man be once dead and laid in the dust, then he can never
attain to repentance for his sins, Faith in the promises, nor unto one
sanctified Grace of Gods Spirit, though he would give a thousand worlds if he
had them; therefore every man's wisdom must be to prepare for death before it
come, according to that counsel of Eccles. 9. 10. Whatsoever thine hand
finds to do, do it with all thy might, for there is Eccles. 9. 10.
neither work nor device, nor wisdom in the grave whither thou go.

Now this Preparation to Death stands in five Duties.
1 Duty of Preparation.
First, A man of understanding must furnish himself with those graces and
duties that be most needful at the day of death; He must labor for Faith and
Patience, and Obedience, with other holy graces of God; for he cannot then
spare any grace, but these three a man shall find more especial need of when
he comes to die; Therefore as Noah made an Arc to save himself and his
household from Noah's Arc.
the flood before it came; so must every man before death come, labor to save
and secure himself, that he may have a place of shelter in the day of death.
Wherefore if a man would die well, he must first come to live well, for
questionless as a man lives, so is he likely to die. If a man look upon a tree
when it is a felling he may give a shrewd Tree felling.
guess where it will fall; for look where the greatest burden of boughs hang
or grow, that way commonly the tree will fall, and even so, look which way a
man's thoughts and affections carry him in the course of his life, the very same
inclination will sway him at the hour of his death. Therefore a man must
prepare to furnish himself with abundance of holy graces that they may
ouersway him, in his loosing from earth to heaven when he dies: Referring all
unto God and his good will and pleasure with holy David, saying, I held my
peace and said Psalm.
nothing because thou O Lord have done it.

2 Duty of Preparation. How to be armed against the fear of death.
Secondly, A man must, that would die well, arm himself against the fear of
death, for a man cannot die well, if he be afraid to die, therefore he must be
armed against it. If any ask, how must we be armed against the fear of death?
I answer.

First, By persuading himself that it is Gods appointment that he shall die;
yea, that the very time and manner of our death is appointed by him, yea every
fit, pang, and trouble at the time of death: all particulars are appointed, as
Christ shows, Math. 10. 30. But the very Math. 10. 30. 2
hairs of your head are all numbered. Secondly, we must arm our selves
against the fear of death, by considering the comfortable state which
follows after Death; For Christ has quite altered and changed the nature
thereof, so that whereas before death and hell by means of our sins were
chained together to swallow us up, as it is Reu. Revel. 6. 8.
6. 8. Death went before, and Hell followed after; Now Christ has dislinked
and disioyned them, and has made a new union, so that now death goes before
and heaven follows after to the godly and faithful. And therefore as a man
that is ready to pass over some great terrible River Great River passage.
into some delicate garden, must not so much look upon the deep waters, as
think upon the place whither he is a going, so must we do in our journey to
heaven, we must not so much be terrified with the obstacles in our way: as the
benefits we shall have by dissolution, freed from sin, and to enjoy the
felicity of the blessed for evermore; yea, and to consider, that as the Angels
stood ready to carry Lazarus his soul into Abraham's bosom, so stand the
Angels round about the beds of the faithful to carry their souls into heaven,
which is a maine benefit we now have by death; Note.
for it is made to be the great enemy of sin, although by sin it came into
the world; yet God has so altered the former course, as he has made death the
only means to abolish sin in his servants; this should make us rejoice in
the day of death, considering whether death brings a soul fitted for heaven.
If a man should be sent for unto the court to live there, and One sent for to
Court.
to receive honor from the King, if as he entered there should stand a
terrible grim Porter at the gate, this man would not much fear the Porter
being sent for to come to the King, but cast his eyes on the Palace, and busy
himself with the hopes of his entertainment at hand: So, when God sends for us
to live with him in heaven, though death be like a terrible grim Porter, yet
let us not look upon his ugly face, but cast our eyes to heaven and beyond
that, by considering the comforts of that place. by considering, that by death
we die to sin: and that death is the very accomplshing of our salvation:
Sin brings all to death, and God has made death (as I said) a means to
abolish sin, so that first death is the messenger of God. Secondly, it is the
door to let us into heaven. Thirdly, it is the death of sin. Fourthly, Death
is a consu^mation of our sanctification here in this world, therefore a true
penitent soul has no cause to be afraid of death. Indeed the wicked
worldling, whose hope and God in his wealth, has great cause to be afraid of
it, because in a moment it snatches away from him all that he has been a
gathering and drudging for so many years together, leaving him nothing of all
his hundreds and thousands, but a poor wooden coffin to lie in: this makes him
afraid of death. And again, he is afraid of death, because it is not a door
to let him into heaven, but an open wide gate to set him into hell where he
must lie eternally tormented with the Devil and his angels for ever. But a
godly soul who has his place made, his sins repented of, who has lived a
watchful life over his heart and ways, has now no cause to be terrified, but
rather as Christ speaks; To lift up his head and rejoice, knowing that his
Redemption draws near: and that his salvation is now nearer then when he
first believed: So that a Christian until death come may truly say, Morior
dum non morior, I die whilst I do not die.

Thirdly, a man that would die well, must labor to 3 Duty of Preparation.
Combat fighting.
weaken death betimes; If a man were to fight a combat with an enemy for his
life, having the dyeting of him a week before the combat or more, I hope no
man thinks but that it were good policy, to make his enemy so feeble and
poor, that he should not be able to strike a stroke to hurt him: So every man
and woman living must have a combat with death; and yet this is a great mercy
of God showed us, that we have the dieting of death, so that we may weaken it
if he will, and abate his strength. Our good life weakens him, and our sins
give strength unto him. Therefore if we have any care of our estate, let us
provide to weaken him before we come to the combat, that he do not foil and
overcome us. Let us deal with him as the Philistims did with Sampson, Judge.
16. 21. Sampson.
when they perceived that his strength lay in his hair, by and by they cut off
his hair, and made him as feeble and weak as other men: So must we do,
intending to weaken the great strength of death; we must labor to find
wherein his strength consists, and finding that it lies in our sins, we must
then as Daniel speaks, break off Dan. 4. 27.
our sins by righteousness, endeavor to remove them as soon as may be.
Wherefore I exhort every one of you who hope for the favor of God, to repent
you of your sins, and set a work the power of grace, that so you may attain
for your comfort to find Death weakened in the day of Death.

LECT. XII.
V. THE CASE OF REpentance, of comfort in Death.
NVM. 23. 10. Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be
like his.
IT is one thing to stand a mile off and show a man a town or a country, and
another thing to take him by the hand, and bring him into the gates, A far
and near sight.
and so carry him from street to street, from place to place, not only showing
the thing a far off, but a part of the glory of the same; so in this present
Treatise which we have in hand, it is one thing to tell you that there is a
way, whereby the righteous may obtain to die well (if they will not neglect
it) and another thing to take you by the hand and go with you from field to
field, from particulars to particulars, till we have put you into the gates of
heaven; The one we have done out of the ability God gave; and now we desire
to perform the other.

The duties of Preparation I show, consisted of five several heads; First,
that a man of understanding must furnish himself with those graces and duties
that be most needful at the day of death. Secondly, that a man in this case
must arm himself against the ^eare of death. Thirdly, that a man must learn
to weaken death betimes. Now we go on.

4 Duty of Preparation.
Fourthly, He who would die well, must begin to die betimes; he must die
daily, as the Apostle professes of his own practice, 1. Cor. 15. 31. I
protest by our re^oycing which we have in Christ Jesus, I die daily. So must
we do, we must be a dying daily, muring our selves to death before death
come. This world must be the school wherein we must learn to die; for it
must teach us by the word of God, to set the less by this world, and all
worldly things. Legs and arms tied.
Surgeons when they come to cut off arms or legs, they Burden carried.
carry this great cross of death, for a man that would inure himself to carry
a great burden, he must first inure himself to carry the lesser; so it is in
death to go through this coragiously and well, one must first accustom
himself to bear the lesser crosses, and smaller troubles incident in this our
frail life: for if he cannot endure the smaller crosses, and as Jeremiah
speaks, run with the Ier. (...) 2. 5.
footmen, how shall one be able to endure the greater afflictions and run
with horses, in terrible ouerflowings? Thus he who would die well, must die
daily, every cross, trouble, or change, must be as a day of death unto him.

5 Duty of our Preparation. Heb. 5. 7.
Fifthly, in this case one must often pray unto God to take away the bitterness
of death; as the Author to the Hebrews speaks, Christ's practice was, Heb. 5.
7. Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and
supplications with strong cries and tears unto him that was able to save him
from death, and was also heard in that which he feared. If then Christ with
many cries and strong tears prayed God instantly and earnestly to take away
that cup from him, so must every true Christian be content to go into his
chamber or closet, there heartily and earnestly to pray unto God, to take away,
lessen, and ^gate the bitterness of the pains of death; If one thus do
constantly believe it, he shall find great comfort in the hour of death.
When the people had light upon the bitter waters of Marah, yea so bitter, that
they could not drink them, Exodus, 15. 15. as Moses saw Exodus 15. 15. Bitter
waters.
the people in this extremity, God showed him a tree, which when Moses had
cast a little of it in the water, by and by it became sweet, even so must we
pray unto God that into the bitter cup of our death, he would cast in a little
of the sweet wood of the cross of Christ: I mean a little spiritual comfort
in and through his gracious promises, and then as he endured his sorrow and
sweates, so the sourest death shall become most easy unto us.

Thus having declared unto you the duties of Preparation for death, it remains
I show you how to practice the same. We read, Math. 19. 22. when the rich man
Math, 19. 22.
came to Christ, desirous to know how he might attain eternal life, and
Christ had told him, that for attaining thereof he must sell all he had and
give to the poor, he went away sorrowful. So it may be that many who come
hither to learn how to die, when they hear that it must cost them so dear,
that there is so much ado about it, and must endure a great deal of labor
and pain, will be content never to go about it. And yet as the wise Wise
men's journey.
men took a long ^ourney, with a great deal of travel and pains to find
out Christ, Mat. 2. 10. whom having found, they were exceeding glad and
joyful: so whosoever he be that labors and takes much pains to die well,
having once attained the same, the joy of so comfortable a passage at such a
pinch, will make him rejoice, and think all his labor and pains well spent.
The next thing to be considered, is,

Secondly, That there must be a holy disposition at the time of death.

For though a man have made preparation for it, yet if he do not holily
dispose himself when he comes to die, he may want the blessing of a
comfortable and quiet death. As when qualmes come over or upon a man, if he
Cure of qualms.
have Aquavitae, Rosasolis, or other comfortable waters by him, he may be
refreshed and revived; but if because of some covetous humor or neglect* he let
the bottles hang by, neither tasting or applying any remedy, it is all one as
if he had been without them. So it may be with a man at the time of death, he
may have the warers of good wishes by him, prepare himself for God, and
pretend before hand to receive comfort in his sickness; yet if he let them
lie by, and apply them not, that is, stir them not up in himself, for all his
preparation, he may find little or no comfort at death. Therefore there must be
a spiritual excitation and stirring up of the graces of God at that time; the
rather because that is the last act of our life, the last part we shall play
upon the stage of this world. Saint Paul, 1. Cor. 15. 26. calls it, The last
enemy that shall be subdued, is Death, etc. Therefore because Death is the 1.
Cor. 15. 26.
last of our life, we should have a special care to act and perform that
well. A good Mariner who has carried a ship Matiners care.
well two or three years through the raging seas, will especially double his
care for her safe landing; that she do not miscarrie when she as ready to
enter into the Harbor. Even so a man who has well disposed of the little
bark of his body fifty or sixty years through the troublesome seas of this
world, must have a great care to lay it down well at the day of death, or else
he shall stain all his former cunning and knowledge. Thus you see there must
be a holy disposition in Death; which consists in six things.

First, That a man be willing to die, when the time is Thing in a holy
disposition.
come; that one do not then hang after the world, and desire to tarry longer,
when God would have him depart by appointment. As a merchant who sends his
factor beyond seas to traffic for him, he must be contented to tarry there
or return at his masters pleasure: So must we A factors patience.
do, because we be all servants of almighty God, sent hither into this world
to be employed about his business, as long as he will have us: Therefore
when he sends for us, we must be willing and ready to come home and give up
our accounts, though we leave all behind us. Thus our blessed Savior many a
time delivered himself from death and danger, he went into Egypt, he fled
into the wilderness, and many times avoided his enemies. But when the time was
come, as we see John 18. 4. then John 18 4.
he went out willingly to meet with death: So Moses desired that he might go
over Jordan, and tread upon the Land of Promise: But when God had denied him
this request, and told him he must die in the wilderness, he went as
willingly unto the place of his death, as we do to a feast or banquet: So old
Simeon, when he had once gotten Christ into his arms, became most willing to
die, Luke 2. singing that Song, Now Lord let thou thy servant ^uk. 2.
depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation; this is the first
thing in this holy disposition, to be willing to die: Wherefore it is a
lamentable case, that a number professing Christianity should so hang upon the
world at that time, like natural men, mentioned Psalm. 17 14. Psalm. 17. 14.
Which have their portion in this life whose belly thou fillest with thy hid
treasure, etc. It is wonderful that worldlings do thus, but that Christians
should do so who have laid up their hope in God, the comforts of salvation in
Christ, and expect this as thechiefest happiness, it is a woeful thing. The
good people, Numb. 13. when Numb. 13. Grapes encouragement.
they saw the clusters of grapes which were brought upon a bar between two
men, they made have toward the land of promise, and encouraged one another to
rise up and enter: even so when God has given us some first fruits of the
Spirit, some taste of the joys of the life to come; some little grapes of our
heavenly country, what should we do, but make haste and dispatch speedily to
enter into the full possession of the same.

2 Thing in a holy disposition.
Secondly, One must then let all go and apply himself wholly to the salvation
of his soul; So we see the good thief did when he came to die, all his care
was for the salvation of his soul; though he hung in pain and torment, yet
he prays to Christ, not for relief from death, or to ease his pain, but
only that Christ would remember him when he came into his kingdom; Even so
must we do, when we come to die, we must not look after our pains, nor
after our ease or worldly accounts, but that our souls may be saved, how we
may stand before God with an upright conscience. If a man's house be on Best
things saved.
fire and he cannot in this danger save all his goods, he will yet apply
himself to save his best things, carry out his jewels, plate and money, with
some of his best household stuff, that if any perish, the worst may burn
first. Thus must a man do at the day of death, when he sees that he cannot
save all, because he must lose his soul or his goods; the best way then is to
let all go, and wholly to apply ones self to save his soul at the day of
death.

3 Thing in a holy disposition.
Thirdly, One must labor to die in faith, as he has lived therein, as Heb.
11. 13. Heb. 11. 13.
It is said of the Fathers, all these died in faith; They died not all in their
beds, nor of a lingering sickness, nor amongst their friends, for some were
sawen asunder, some stoned, but all died in faith. And our Savior Christ we
know when he came to die, and his very greatest extremities of death upon him:
on the very agony of death he did wholly rest upon God, crying out, My God,
my God: so must we do in the greatest pains and calamities of death, yea in
torments, wholly cast ourselves upon Gods love and favor as our surest hold;
we should shut up our eyes, and cast our selves on his mercy, with full
persuasion that though we shall dwell in the dens of death for a little while,
yet one day he will raise us up, and make us partakers of Heaven, where we
shall have the comfortable presence of God and his holy Angels and blessed
Saints for ever. It is observed, that when a man is in danger of drowning,
look what they have in their hands they hold fast, and never part with it, no
not when life leaves them, so must a Christian soul do in the time of death,
cast up his arms and lay hold upon Christ, never part with him, no not when
the last breath leaves him.

The Faith a Christian must die in, consists in three things.
1 Thing a man must die in.
First, He must die in the faith of his own Reconciliation with God; that God
is at peace with him, and become his good Father by the means of Jesus Christ,
and therefore boldly to go unto God as unto our Father, knowing that no child
can be so welcome to his father, as we shall be unto the Lord our God, which is
the comfort that the Church has left unto her by Christ, Ioh. 20. 17. Go unto
Ioh. 20. 17.
my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and
unto my God and your God; As if he should say, Let it be your comfort, that
God is your Father, heaven is your home, he is not a stranger unto you, but
your God is more compassionate, then any earthly father can be. This way only
the Prodigal son took for mercy, when his case was desperate, Luke 15. 18.
For he Luke 15. ^8.
thus disputed with himself, whatsoever I have been, or wheresoever I have
lived, it is no matter, yet because he is my Father I will go home and crave
pardon in hope of mercy: So must a man thus by the means of faith say. I will
go to God as to my Father; Though I walk in the Psalm. 23.
midst of the valley of the shadow of death, yet will I fear none evil: for
my Father will have a care of me in all estates: I am his, this man may depart
with comfort, and find joy and peace accompany his passage.

2 Faith of his happy estate to come.
Secondly, A man must die in the faith of his own happy and comfortable estate
after death, that being a true Luke 9. 31.
penitent, death shall be nothing else but a door to let him into everlasting
life: So that as Christ's death, Luke 9. 31. is termed Transitus, a departing,
a passage only, a passing from one place to another: so death is but a
departing, a passing from earth to heaven, from sinful men to be with God,
Saints, and Angels, and with the spirits of just men come to perfection, from
things transitory, to things everlasting. To this effect Job speaks, Job. 14.
14. Job. 14. 14.
If a man die shall he live again, and all the days of my appointed time
will I wait until my change come. So Paul, Philip. 1. 23. I desire to be
dissolved and to be with Phil. 1. 23.
Christ. Again, For we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle be
dissolved, we have a building of 1. Cor. 5. 1.
God, an house not made with hands, which is eternal in the heavens. Whereby
is signified the state of eternal glory and life everlasting: and therefore
as old Jacob revived, Genes.
when he saw the Chariots and horses come, which should carry him into Egypt,
so because death is the fiery chariot of Almighty God, whereby all his
children Jacobs Chariot.
and chosen are carried home unto eternal life, let us comfortably lay hold
upon faith, when we see the chariots of Almighty God stand ready at our
doors, and rejoice that death will do as much for us, as these fiery
chariots did for Elias which carried him into heaven, and be no more afraid of
death then he was of that fiery chariot and horses which carried him into
heaven, both having alike commission, though not in the same manner.

3 In persuasion of a Resurrection.
Thirdly, We must die in the persuasion of our own blessed and joyful
resurrection, that howsoever our bodies shall be dissolved into dust, and die as
others, yet that one day we shall arise and live again. Thus Job fortified
himself against all his miseries with hope of the resurrection, as Job 19.
Job. 19. 25.
25. I know that my Redeemer lives, and he shall stand the last on the earth,
and though worms destroy this body, yet shall I see him in my flesh, etc. This
also supported the Prophet David, Psalm. 16. 9. Wherefore my heart was Psalm. 16.
9.
glad, and my tongue rejoiced, and my flesh rested in hope, for thou will not
leave my soul in the grave, neither will thou suffer thine holy one to see
corruption. This was the faith of David that he was persuaded that God would
bring this body out of the grave at the time appointed, and herewith Christ
does also comfort himself in the days of his flesh, Math. 15. 21. That
although he should Math. 15. 21.
suffer many things at the hands of the Elders, and of the high Priests and
Scribes being slain; yet that the third day he should rise again. Now that
which was the stay of Christ, of Job, of David, that must be the stay of every
faithful soul, in all troubles and afflictions.

4 In our patient suffering.
Fourthly, We must show forth especial patience at the hour of death, for
though we have need of patience in the whole course of our life; yet at that
time most of all: So the Author to the Hebrews shows: For ye have need Heb.
10. 36.
of patience, that when ye have done the will of God ye might receive the
promise, so all had need of patience. This much was our Saviors practice
mentioned, Act. 8. Act 8. 3^.
32. He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before
the shearers, so opened he not his mouth. Now Peter shows us, that Christ
has suffered, leaving us an example, that we should also suffer with him, 1.
Pet. 2. 21. Because (says he) Christ also suffered for 1. Pet. 2. 21.
us, leaving us an example that we should follow his steps, therefore as Christ
showed extraordinary patience at the hour of death, so must we meekly and
patiently submit our selves under the mighty hand of God when we come to die.

For our help in this case, observe three things which may make us patient in
the day of death.
1 Consideration to make us patient in death.
Mic. 7. 9.
First, To consider that our pains be always less then our sins; and that
we feel not the thousand part of that which we deserve to suffer: as the
Church acknowledges, Mic. 7. 9. I will bear the indignation of the Lord,
because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause and bring me
forth to the light, then shall I see his righteousness, etc. So the Thief
upon the cross confessed, Luke 23. 40. saying to his fellow, Do thou not
fear Luke 23. 40.
God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation: and we indeed justly suffer,
for we receive the due reward for our deeds. So Ierem. 10. 19. Woe is me for
my hurt, my wound Ier. 10. 19.
is grievous, but I said, truly, this is my burden and I must bear it. So must
every one say, this and this affliction, cross or misery is for my sins;
all this trouble and vexation is nothing in regard of that which I have
deserved by reason of my sins, which God might have imposed upon me.

That our pains are nothing to the pains of Christ, which he suffered for
us. He died on the Cross, we for the most part die in our beds, he died
among soldiers; we for the most part die amongst our friends, he was put to
all extremity at his death, and we for the most part depart of a long
lingering disease. Augustine to this purpose says well; Let man suffer what he
will, and let his pains be never so great, yet he cannot come near the
reproaches, the crown of thorns, sweates of blood, buffetings, reuilings which
our Savior suffered: though he was God, and we but sinful men, he our Lord,
and we his servants, he clean, we polluted; he innocent and we guilty
and unrighteous. Therefore seeing our pains in death (at worst) are so far
short of his, we should be patient.

3 Consideration Reu. 14. 13.
Thirdly, To consider these pains are finite, not lasting, and that they bring
us to everlasting ease. So we have it, Reu. 13. 14. Blessed are the dead which
die in the Lord from henceforth, for they rest from their labors, etc. So
Isa. 57. 2. it is said of a righteous man, He shall enter into Isa. 57. 2.
peace: They shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.
Thus all good men shall be at rest with him when death comes, until afterward
that they come to eternal, full, and everlasting ease; therefore this should
make us patient at the day of death, because after a little pain, we come to a
great deal of ease. We know when a Iayler knocks off a prisoners bolts,
fetters and Irons; it may be the wearing of the Irons, puts him to a great
Prisoners bolts.
deal less pain then the knocking them off does, yet though every blow go
to the heart of him, he is content to be patient and still, because he knows
that pain will bring him more ease afterward. So all men ly^here fettered and
grieved with the bolts and irons of mortality and sin, in which case it may
be when God comes to knock off those irons by death, that we feel more
pains and extremity then before: yet because this brings to ease, and
everlasting peace and rest, therefore it should make us patient having thereby
these fetters of mortality and sin loosed by death.

The fifth thing in a holy disposition.
Fifthly, a maine duty is, That we must then endeavor that our speeches be
gracious and heavenly at the time of Death; That there be sweet exhortations,
sauourie, experimental speeches to the beholders, questions of purity,
courage, and encouragement: as grapes showed unto Grapes.
them of that country whither we are a removing to, as a light shining forth
unto them, even from the confines of death, that the beholders our friends may
be, as instructed, so comforted in our happy and blessed departure. We find
(as a learned man well observes) that a man cannot go so softly in moist
grounds, but he will leave prints and marks behind him of his footsteps, so
Prints of going.
that though he be gone by, yet one may know which way he went: So a man
should not go hence so softly to heaven, but he ought to leave some marks and
prints of his footsteps, in his good life, good speeches, heavenly meditations,
joyful excitations, and practice of holy graces, contempt of the world, etc.
which shows whither we are a going, even home to our Fathers house; So Christ
the Pattern of all Humility, holiness, patience and meekness: what a deal
of holy and heavenly speeches did he use before his death, which are ever
memorable, chiefly his seven last words; So Jacob, Genesis 47. what a many
gracious sweet words came from him ere his departure, to his sons and family.
So David before his death blessed and instructed his son Solomon, saying, And
thou Solomon my son, fear thou the Lord God of thy Fathers, etc. The like we
have of S. Paul, Tim.

I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, and henceforth is laid
up for me a crown, etc. Steven also called upon the Lord Jesus toward his
end, and Moses blessed the twelve Tribes of Israel; more instances I might
give, but these may suffice to show, that every man must endeavor that his last
words may be gracious and seemly when he comes to die.

The sixth thing in a holy disposition.
The sixth and last Duty at the time of death is, Holily to resign ones self
into the hands of God, as we see our Savior Christ did, Luke 23. 46. Father
into thy hands I commend my spirit: So Steven when he was in the greatest Act.
7.
perturbation that might be, in the agony of death said, Lord Jesus into thy
hands I commend my spirit, even when there was a shower of stones about his
ears. Little children for the most part desire to die in their Fathers bosom,
or upon their mothers lap, even so must a Christian Children dying.
in the hour of death lay down his head upon the sweet breast and bosom of
Jesus Christ, so rendering up up his soul into the hands of the Lord. If a man
had a most precious jewel which he did esteem above all his Pretiou^ jewel.
wealth, valuing the same at some high rate: in time of danger he would surely
make choice of his best and chiefest friend to commit it in keeping. So seeing
every Christian has a most precious jewel, his soul which does far exceed
all other his wealth: therefore howsoever we trust friends with our lands and
goods, we must only trust the Lord with our bodies and souls, that he may
restore them safe again at the last day. So this is the last duty a Christian
has to do at the day of death, to shut up his own eyes, and to rest upon the
sweet mercy of Jesus Christ to receive him into glory.

If a man do thus prepare himself for death beforehand, and then holily
dispose of himself at the time of death, there is no doubt but he shall die
well and comfortably what death so ever he die; no man can assure himself
when he shall die, where; or of what death; only we know if we go on with
these helps showed, whenever or wheresoever, or howsoever, we shall die the
servants of God, Saints in heaven, in peace of a quiet conscience, so as they
may write upon our tombs and graves such godly Epitaphes, as the Holy Ghost
does upon Moses, So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of
Moab according to the word of the Lord.

LECT. XIII.
OF THE CONTRAries to Repentance.
IEREM. 18. 12. And they said there is no hope, but we will walk after our
own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his wicked heart.
Having spoken of the Cases of Repentance, especially of that great case of
Comfort in Death, we are now to speak of the co^traries of it. For even as
Mariners Mariners at Sea.
when they go to Sea, they must only not have their course described before
them in a Map, but they must also have special notice, of rocks, and shelfes
and sands, that they may avoid them; Even so must the Christian man not only
know the way of the nature, parts, and properties of true repentance, but also
even the Contraries and opposites thereof; to decline them as dangerous rocks
in his spiritual passage toward his heavenly home. If you look into the
Prophecic of Ezekiel, you shall find it thus written, Chap. Ezekiel. 39. 15.
39. 15. And the Passenger which passes through the land, when any sees a
man's bone, then shall he set a sign up by it, etc. So must we set up signs
and tokens in this Signs set up.
passage of our life, that we may avoid these and these places of danger. The
ministers of God are such searchers to find out dead bones, that is men's
sins, and when they have found them they give us special notice of them, and
marks that we may every one look into our selves by repentance; for many
times we are hindered in our repentance and newness of life, for want of
discovery and apparent marks to be directed by. Now these contraries unto it
are two:

1. Impenitencie. 2. Unsound Repentance.
1 Impenitencie what?
First, Impenitencie is a certain block laid in our way by the devil, when a
man has no touch or feeling of his sins, but against his conscience and
knowledge, and judgment, lives in known sins, which for his life he cannot
lament nor leave, or set himself against: And is that Impenitencie mentioned,
Romans 2. 5. But after thy hardness Romans 2. 5.
and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thy self wrath, against the day of
wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God. This is impenitencie,
when a man has sinned, to be as merry as if he had not sinned, and never
trouble his rest for it. Such as are mentioned, 2. Pet. 2. Pet. 2. 14.
2. 14. who cannot cease from sin, eat and drink, are jolly and brave in
company, as if no such matter, like unto Esau, who when he had committed that
heinous sin in selling of his birthright, Genesis 25. 34. was no whit dismayed,
Gen 25. 24.
for says the text: Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles, and
he did eat and drink, and rose up and went his way: Thus Esau despised his
birthright. So Joseph's Brethren when they had seized upon him, stripped him of
his garments, and cast him into a pit, with an intent to destroy him, they were
never a whit moved with the matter, but in a manner added sin to sin, and
sold him to the Ismaelites, Genesis 37. 25. and sat Genesis 37. 25.
down to eat and drink until they saw the Ismaelites unto whom they sold
him. So Ierem. 8. 12. It is said, Were Ier. 8. 12.
they ashamed when they had committed abominations, nay they were not at all
ashamed, neither could they blush. So we see when we are not touched for the
committing of sin, but can be quiet and merry contented to eat and drink,
and sleep as well as if there were no such matter, this is the impenitent and
hard heart spoken of, when one is insensible of sin, for as in some diseases
insensibilitie is a great sign of danger, a man being most fearfully sick,
when he does not feel his sickness; so it is Insensible sickness.
in the state of sin, a man is in the most danger, when he does not see or
feel it. So Ierem. 8. 6. I hearkened and heard, and no man spoke aright, no
man repented of his wickedness, saying, what have I done? And Isa. 9. 13 For
the people turn not to them that smite them, neither do they seek the Lord
of Hosts: So Ezekiel. 33. 31. And they come to thee as thy people comes, and
they sit before thee as thy people, they hear thy words, but they will not do
them, for with the mouth they show much love, but their hearts go after their
covetousness. Now there be

Three causes why the state of impenitencie is such a fearful state to live
in.
Because it binds us fast under damnation, and brings us unto hell, and in a
manner shuts the door of hell and death upon us being once there. As we read
Reu. 20. Revel. 20* 3.
3. That the Angel laid hold on the Dragon that old serpent which is the devil
and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless
pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him; even so does impenitencie deal
Dragon shut up.
with us, our sins fling us into hell, and when we are there, then comes
Impenitencie and shuts down the door upon us, ties us in chains, makes all
so fast, that we have no power or way to get out of the fearful estate we be
in. Therefore 2. Tim. 2. 26. endeavor and exhortation 2. Tim. 2. 26.
in this case is appointed. Proouing if at any time God will give them
repentance, that they may recover themselves out of the s^are of the devil,
who are taken captive by him at his will: So there is a promise that if at any
time a man do come out of the snares of the devil, and repent, he shall have
mercy; but it is very hard to be done, Impenitencie being such a sin as the
Lord every where cries out on: as Amos 3. and Ier. 3. 3. And thou Ier. 3. 3.
have a whoores forehead, thou refusest to be ashamed: So chap. 8. 6. No man
repented him of his wickedness, saying, what have I done? every one returned
to his course as the horse rusheth into the battle. And Isa. 9. 13. For the
people Isa. 9. 13.
turns not unto him that smites them, neither do they seek the Lord of
Hosts: So Ezekiel. 33. 11. As I live Ezekiel. 33. 11.
says the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that
the wicked turn from his wicked ways and live, Turn ye, turn ye from your
evil ways, for why will you die, o house of Israel?

Because it makes void and frustrates all the means of grace and Life: As a
man dwelling in some poor house comfortably with his wife and his children,
the Sun with his bright beams shining and breaking in ^un shutout.
upon them: if one stop up the window and shut out all the comfortable beams;
there comfort is gone: even so it is when God brings the sweet beams of grace
to shine in upon the conscience of a sinner, impenitencie puts a bar against
them, and shuts out all the light of the Lord and of grace that shines into our
hearts, so making all the means of Grace and of Eternal Life unprofitable and
fruitless unto us; wherefore with the holy Prophet David, we must beware of
this feacefull estate, that we may have boldness to say with him, Psalm. 66.
18. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me. This makes
one shameless and obstinate, as Math. 23. 37. How often would I (says Christ)
have gathered thy children together, even as a Hen gathers her chickens
under her wings, and ye would not; Thus Impenitencie shuts out all-thriuing in
Grace.

Because Impenitencie brings the guilt of all our sins upon us: It is true if
we repent, as it is, Micah 7. 19. God will pardon all our sins and cast them
in the bottom of the Sea. But if we live in sin without repentance, this
impenitencie will turn all our sins upon us at the day of Judgment. Thus does
it heap up wrath upon wrath against the day of Gods fierce indignation: even
as a man heaps up gold and silver that is every day Gold and silver heaped up.
adding and increasing it ^^ll it be a great heap, so an impenitent hard
heart, does every day heap up and gather together by heaping of sins, wrath
upon wrath against the day of wrath: So that I may truly say with a learned
man, Better be the greatest sinner in the world, and to repent it, then to be
the least sinner and die in Impenitencie. Which is the worst and most fearful
estate that may be. The uses of all which may be these:

Let us pray to God often to deliver us from it, that though through the
corruption of our nature we cannot choose but sin, yet we may see our
sins, bewail and mourn for them, and that we may never come to that
insensibilitie and deadness of spirit, never to lament or be sorry for them,
but to have strength to remove from this estate, and rise up as soon as may
be: praying with the Prophet, Psalm. 119. I have gone astray like a lost
sheep, seek thy servant for I do not forget thy Commandments. Here you see
was a going astray like a lost sheep; but this was such a straying as might be
found out again.

Let us labor to get out of it as soon as may be; for howsoever our sins
are multiplied by our corruption, yet this sin of impenitencie is more
dangerous than all the rest, and brings at last a fearful despair of mercy
upon us. Therefore as the women going to the Sepulcher of our Savior, Stone
Sepulcher.
were careful who should roll away the great stone which lay at the mouth
thereof. So let every one of us now say and bethink our selves, who shall
roll away this great stone, this hardness of heart, this impenitencie, this
deadness and dullness of Spirit. Therefore as Ierem. 31. 18. The Church prays
and confesses her failings; so let us pray, Convert us, o Lord, and we shall be
converted: and let us use the means diligently, whereby our hearts may be
touched and subdued to a true remorse and sense of sin, and the Majesty
offended.

The second thing contrary to true repentance, is Unsound repentance.

2 Unsound Repentance, what?
This kind of repentance is, When a man shows a kind of repentance, but he
does it not in such sort and manner as God requires it, as Isa. 58. 5. Is it
such a fast as I have chosen, a day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to
bow down his head like a bulrush, and to spread sackecloath and ashes under
him? Will thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the Lord? It is Gods
expostulation with his people: as if he should say, Is this such a Fast as I
have chosen? I have chosen fasting, indeed, and commanded it, but you failed in
the true meaning and manner of it: I care for no outward shows, so much as the
inward humiliation. So the Lord has chosen repentance, and commanded it, but
we must look for such a kind and manner as the Lord has chosen. Now there be
two sorts of unsound repentance.

1. Hypocritical Repentance. 2. Desperate Repentance.
1 Trials of hipocriticall repentance.
Of the first, there be four marks or notes to discover hypocritical
Repentance, i. When it is in show, and not in the heart, when a man seems to
repent of his sin, and undertakes an outward show of sorrow and sadness,
without any inward compunction of spirit: of which the Lord complains, Ierem.
3. 10. And yet for all this, her Ier. 3. 10.
treacherous sister Judah has not turned unto me with her whole heart, but
feinedly, says the Lord. So Hos. 7. 14. Hos. 7. 14.
the Lord complains, And they have not cried unto me with their whole heart,
when they howled upon their beds, they assemble themselves for corn and wine,
and they rebel against me. And Psalm. 78. 35. 36. And they remembered Psalm. 78.
35. 36.
that God was their rock, and the high God their Redeemer; nevertheless they
did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
They had good speeches with their lips, but their hearts were not upright.

When a man is more grieved for the punishment of his sin than for the sin
it self. As Cain said unto the Lord, Genes. 4. 13. My punishment is greater
then I can bear; but he never cried out for his sin: So Number. 21. 7. The people
came to Moses, importuning him to pray to God to remove the fiery Serpents
from them; but were not so earnest for to remove their sins: The Prophets
are full of these complaints of the people to remove the Judgments of God from
them: when yet their endeavors to remove their sins were faint or none at
all; and is it not so with us? Here is sometimes a kind of show of sorrow,
sadness, and complaining on our crosses and grieuances, and so an outward
profession of Repentance, which without the heart and true reformation of life
is but an hypocritical repentance.

When a man repents him of a sin, and by and by falls as wilfully into the same
sin as before: as the Lord complains by the Prophet, Psalm. 106. 13. They
soon forgot his works, and waited not for his counsel. So Pharaoh repented
often, Exodus 8. 9. yet when the punishment was off him, he was as ill as
before. Therefore when a man wiltake on to envy against any sin, be it
swearing, drunkenness, etc. and by and by run into the same sins, it is an
hypocritical repentance. I grant some sins hang upon a man through the
corruption of Nature, and will hardly be shaken off: So that if we do not
strive against them and labor to weaken their forces, they must and will by
their use and custom bring on hardness of heart, and so no repentance at all,
wherefore let us set a watch upon our hearts for fear of returning to our old
sins, and leave sin before it leave us.

When a man will repent of one sin, and yet live wittingly in a number of
other sins. This was the sin of Judas, he seemed to repent the betraying
of his master, but never thought (for ought we know) of a number of other
sins he lived in. So Ahab made a show of repentance for the killing of
Naboth, but never repented for killing the Lords Prophets nor of his Idolatry.
It is true indeed, That he that repents truly of any one sin, repents of all;
because, Eadem formalis ratio, makes him hate all: which hatred will at last,
make him get out of al these snares: yet there is in many a corruption ortaint
of sin cleaving to some, and forsaking others: which is another sort of
hypocritical repentance.

The second Contrary to true Repentance,
2 Desperate repentance.
I told you was desperate repentance, when a man sees his sins, and the horror
of them, and yet never has any serious thoughts of turning from them, but
perish thus; and so it may be at last in some fury or rage they cry out upon
them, as we know Judas did, he confessed hi sin and saw it, but did despair
of Gods mercy in pardoning it, this was unsound repentance: For repentance is
such a secret foe to sin, that it makes one with all his heart endeavor to
turn from it: therefore whosoever does not turn from his sin, is not likely
to come unto Repentance. So Julian the Apostate came at last to desperation,
Julian.
when he threw up his blood in the air, and cried out; O Galilean thou have at
last overcome! Now this Tandem Galilat vicisti.
Repentance shall be in all the damned at the day of Judgment, to see and
bewail their sins; yet perishing under the burden of them, desiring hills
and mountains to fall upon them, and cover them. It is true then that all men
shall repent at one time or other, sooner or later; either in this life or at
the day of Judgment. Therefore how much better were it for men to repent here
in this life, where they may have peace and joy in God and their own
consciences, then too late, with all torments unsupportable hereafter, when
they shall have no benefit by such an afflictue penal repentance. Therefore
let us repent betimes since God is so gracious to accept of us, though we have
been great and grievous sinners; for this, see what Samuel said unto the
people, in their contrition, 1. Sam. 12. 20. Fear not, ye have done all this
wickedness, yet turn not aside from following after the 1. Sam. 12. 20.
Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart, and turn ye not aside; for
then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for
they are vain: for the Lord will not forsake his people for his own great
Names sake, etc. So Peter in his Sermon, Act. 3. 19. exhorts them; Repent ye
therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out. So Ierem. 3.
1. Thou have played the harlot with many lovers, yet turn again to me, says
the Lord.

And farther, besides these two sorts of unsound Repentance, there be two sorts
may be suspected.

1. Poenitentia sera: Late Repentance. 2. Poenitentia Coacta: Forced
Repentance.
Now though both these sorts of Repentance may be true, yet may they also be
suspected, first, as for Late Repentance, Late Repentance.
when a man neglects and puts it off all his life, until the day of death, it
is greatly to be suspected, especially when a man has had good means of
conversion, growing in grace, and living under a good ministry. We read in
the story of Esau, Heb. 12. 17. because he Esaus Tears.
neglected the time of obtaining the blessing, that afterward when he would
have inherited the blessing he was rejected, for he found no place of
Repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears, So it may be suspected
that if a man neglect repentance all his lifetime, it will be hardly found at
last; For Augustine in this case says well: If a man repent when he can sin
no more, it may be thought he forsakes not his sin, but his sin forsakes
him. the good Thief on the Cross, his repentance was late and true. Therefore
a man may truly repent at last. that late Repentance may not be true; but that
it may fail, and be suspected: as for the good Thief consider two things:
Coeliarcanum, A Divine secret, and not within our reach.

2 Constrained Repentance.
Secondly, Constrained Repentance, when one does repent, but in the time of
trouble, or in some great sickness, afflictions, or when the judgments of God
are upon him: as was seen in Pharaoh, Exodus 8. 15. of whom it is written; But
when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened
not unto them as the Lord had said. So also Numb. 16. 34. when the ground
opened and swallowed up Korah, Dathan and Abiram, with their company, the
children of Israel hearing the cry fled away, and were afraid lest they also
should be swallowed up, but yet notwithstanding after this judgment they did
murmr against God and against Moses. So there is a number of men and women
amongst us that never think of Repentance, but when the hand of God lies
heavy upon them, as it is Psalm. 78. 34. 35. When he slew them then they
sought him, etc. Therefore let us pray unto God to take away the hardness of
our hearts from us, and give us a melting relenting heart, with the spirit of
grace to overrule our corruptions. First let us pray to God, that we may
repent of our sins with inward sorrow: Secondly, that we may be grieved for
our sins rather then the punishment of them: Thirdly, that we may repent
with resolution to sin no more. And lastly, that we may repent of all our
sins, those most predominant as well as the rest, which we seem to hate and
abhor.

LECT. XIIII.
OF THE INCREASE of Repentance.
2. PET. 3. 18. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ; to him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.
IF a man should bring all you that are here present to a Mine of gold, and
Mine of gold.
tell you that every man might gather for himself; what would you do? stand
still and gaze about you; nay rather would you not set your selves about
together: Even so does the Lord deal with you in the use of these good means,
he brings you to a Mine of Gold, better then any the world can yield; he bids
you every man to gather for himself, and therefore, Lord that any man should
stand still, mispend the time, and not apply himself to gather these precious
things that be before him! Weespake the last day as you heard of the
Contraries to Repentance, which are two: Impenitencie and unsound Repentance:
Now it remains in the next and last place that we speak of The Increase of
Repentance; How a Christian as he increases in other graces of God, so also
must grow in the grace of Repentance: wherein two things are to be declared:

1. That no man's Repentance is perfect in this life. 2. Because our Repentance
is imperfect in this life, therefore as we increase in other graces of God, so
must we grow in this also.
Now if no man's Repentance be perfect in this life, then no man living can
perfectly repent him of his sins, and therefore when he has repented, he
had need to turn again and to pray God to forgive the imperfection of it. Yet
lest any man should be deceived in this, we must know that two ways
Repentance is said to be imperfect;

1. In regard of the Nature of Repentance. 2. In regard of the Degrees, and the
Measure of it.
Every man's Repentance therefore (as we say) is imperfect, but how? Not in
regard of the Nature of Repentance to him that has truly repented, but only
in regard of the degrees and the measure of it, it does not want any part of
true Repentance, but only wants the perfection of that part; and so we say in
respect of measure and degrees every man's repentance is imperfect in this life.
Even as we sec a little child has all the parts of a man none A childs parts.
wanting, yet has it not the perfection of those parts; it is not yet come to
the strength, growth, just measure, sizes and height of a man: So it is in the
Repentance of a true Christian, it has all the parts of true Repentance, only
(as I say) it wants the perfections of those parts, being not imperfect in
Nature, but in Measure and Degrees. Now that every man's Repentance is imperfect
in this life, it is proved;

1. Generally. 2. Particularly.
1 Proof.
Generally, because the state of this life is a state of Imperfection;
therefore no man can possibly attain to perfection in this world, this God
has reserved until we come home to heaven. Schoolmen say well and agreeable
to the Scriptures: from Math. 5. 25. That as long as we are in this life, we
are not in our country, but in the way: As there it is said, Agree quickly
with thine adversary whilst thou art in the way with him, etc. Our way Way.
now is the way to heaven, therefore because we are but yet on our journey in
the way, our state is a state of imperfection, as the Apostle shows, 1. Cor.
13. 9. 10. For we know in part and prophecy in part, but when that which is
perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. So S. Paul
says of himself, Phil 3. 12. Not as ehough I had already attained, either
were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for
which I also am apprehended of Christ Jesus. So Job 9. 20. If I justify my
self (says he) mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say I am perfect it
shall also prove me perverse. And James 3. 2. he affirms in many things we
offend all; If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able
also to bridle the whole body. Thus it appears (as a Father speaks) that all
just men have but an imperfect perfection in this life.

Particularly it is proved thus: No man can know all his sins, which if he
cannot know, then he cannot repent of them so fully as he should: to which
purpose the Prophet speaks and prays, Psalm. 19. 12. Who can understand his
errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults: wherefore it is clear, one cannot
repent him expressly of those sins he knows not; but what he knows and is
convinced of, those he ought to repent particularly. Secondly, No man, though
he knew every sin he committed, is able to repent of the same perfectly, in
regard of his corruption, so long as he carries frail flesh about him, and
why? Because there is no motion of the spirit, but it is much weakened by the
tentations of the flesh: as Gal. 5. 17. For the flesh lusts against the
spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and they are contrary the one to the
other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. So the Apostle
confesses of himself; Romans 7. 18. For I know that in me, that is in my flesh
dwells no good thing, for to will is present with me, but how to perform
that which is good I find not; and why? because the law of our members still
rebels against the law of our mind, and therefore as when men pour water
into a glass of wine, the water abates Water and Wine.
the strength, taste and color of the Wine: even so it is between the flesh
and the spirit, the motions of the spirit be always weakened with the motions
of the flesh in some measure or other: so as we cannot do as we would, but
live encumbered with a number of corruptions, clogged and weighed down with
natural frailties; which make that we cannot perfectly repent us of all our
sins in this life. Now against this doctrine there may be three objections.



All the works of God are perfect; Repentance is a work of God: Therefore
Repentance may be perfect in a man in this life.
Some God works immediately. Secondly, Some he works not immediately by
himself, but mediatly by man. Now those works of God which he works by
himself they be perfect works, and have no defects; but those works which God
works by means of man, those be not always perfect, but many times carry
some points and marks of frailty in them: As we know, a Scriuener who writes
a perfect hand of himself, yet let him put the Pen into a Childs hand lead.
childs hand; though he guide it, his writing will not be so fair as that of
his teacher, because it somewhat participates of the childs unskillfulness: So
it is in this matter of Repentance, because this is not a work which God
works merely by himself, but by the means of a man himself assisting,
using his will and other affections therein; Therefore because there is defect
in man's affection, and Reluctation in his will, resisting well-doing, therefore
his repentance must needs be imperfect.

The second Objection is taken out of Scripture; where the Scripture many times
seems to speak of the perfection of a Christian, sometimes commanding it; as
Math. 5. 48. Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
is perfect: Sometime commending man for it: as 1. Cor. 2. 6. Howbeit we speak
wisdom amongst them that are perfect, etc. So Phil. 3. 13. Let us therefore as
many as be perfect be thus minded, etc.

And therefore if there be perfection in other graces; There is also
perfection in Repentance.

Comparatiue, in comparison of others, as in the same third chapter of the
Philippians, S. Paul has plainly affirmed that he was not perfect before God:
howeuer now he is perfect Comparative more perfect then other men, who had not
such excellent gifts and graces: As Noah was a just and perfect man, in respect
of those wretched people who lived in those times, Genesis 6. 50. So Job and
Zachary in this respect were called ^ust men. Secondly, Ex part, we may be
said to be just and perfect in some respect and degrees: as Math. 5. be ye
therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect. Here we cannot be so
perfect in the intention of our love: but in the Extention thereof, to love all
sorts, to love our enemies; to love friends and foes, and do good to all of
all sorts, with an eye unto God; that is, that perfection here meant and spoken
of.

The third Objection is this: All the graces of God that be imperfect in this
life, shall be perfected in heaven, 1. Cor. 13. 10.

But our Repentance shall not be perfected in Heaven, for in heaven there is
no sorrow for sin, as Reu. 16. 17. for God shall wipe away all tears from
their eyes.

Therefore because repentance shall not be perfected in heaven, it must needs
be perfected in this life.

To this I answer, there be two parts of Repentance, considerable:

1. There is a Poenall part (if I may so call it.) 2. A Part that consists in
sanctified motions.
Poenall sorrow, afflicting tears, and such like, shall cease in heaven, and
is merely shut up within the bounds of this life. But, that part thereof which
consists in sanctified motions shall be perf^cted in heaven, because we shall
perfectly dislike and hate all the sins that over we have committed: Thus
the doctrine being clear, the uses are three.

as we pray unto God to pardonour other imperfections; so we must pray to
pardon the failings of our repentance; not to weigh them in the balance of
Justice, lest they be found light, but in the balance of ^ercie, where small
things are taken in good worth; and therefore as the man in the Gospel came to
Christ with tears, saying, Lord I believe, help my unbelief; So must we all
Mark. 9. ^4.
cry unto God with mournful and heavy hearts: Lord I repent, but for Christ's
sake pardon the many failings of my Repentance.

therefore it is clear, that no man by his Repentance can merit any thing at
the hands of God; The very Schoolmen say the selfsame thing: that any
defect, Caietan. q. 11. ad Co^rad.
want or impenitencie makes our Repentance to be imperfect; yea, all we can
do is full of defects and wants, therefore no merit before God; and if it
merit nothing at the hands of God, then when men have repented them of their
sins, they have need still of the Blood of Christ to make Reconciliation and
atonement for them. It is the opinion of some in the world, that if one have
repented of a sin, by and by he shall be saved by the virtue of his
repentance. But the truth is, that though repentance be a necessary duty and
disposition, without which no man living can be saved in this state of sin;
and though it be never so sincerely performed and often reiterated, yet because
it is full of so many imperfections, it had need of the Blood of Christ to
perfect it, and reconcile us unto God, holy, clean, and unblameable in his
sight: as Peter tells us; Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual
1. Pet. 2. 5.
house, an holy Priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifice, acceptable to God
by Jesus Christ. So that do what we can, all sacrifices and services be only
acceptable to God through him.

Therefore no man is to dismay himself, and be too much cast down, if he
do not find repentance to be perfect in him; If he do not find a perfect
hatred of sin, love of God, endeavor to please God in that he requires; In
this case one must not too much afflict himself, because he cannot attain to
things impossible in this life; considering, that it is not perfection but
truth of Repentance that God looks for in this life: in which case S. Paul
comforts the abject, saying, 2. Cor. 8. 12. For if there be first a willing
mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and not according to that a
man has not.

2 Maine point. The increase of Repentance
The second maine thing is, That because every man's Repentance is imperfect in
this life; Therefore there must be an increase thereof in the life of a
Christian: As we increase in other graces, so increasing in the grace of
Repentance. Therefore Christians have no cause to be dismayed at this, when
God brings them off again and again to renew their Repentance. A number of
poor Christians cannot tell what to make of this, when they have repented
their sins, and been comforted with the Promises of the Gospel, and gone on
a long-while in a cheerful estate upon a sudden; all their old sins are
cast upon them again to terrify them worse then before, and so by a heavy
recourse of sorrow they become much perplexed and amazed. But let such think
that this is nothing else but Repentance: As in a little child when he begins
first to write, he frames his business somewhat Child writing.
unhandsomely, when he has perfected a letter, his Master sets him to make the
same letter again, until he do it better and better, until at last it be
excellently well. Even so because there are not those firm and true intensions
Note well. Comfort.
of our affections in our first Repentance, the Lord is feign to go over
again with us, and to set us anew to repent of our old sins: thus is the
growth and frame of a Christians progress in grace, to go it over again
still, until it come to perfection. I have heretofore observed, A Tree growing.
that a tree always grows until it come to his full pitch of state; yet it
grows not always in one sort, but sometimes it grows in the boughs,
sometimes in the branches, sometimes in the root. Even so it is with a
Christian, he has his times of growth, he does not always grow in one and
the same sort; but sometimes in one Grace, and sometimes in another; sometimes
in knowledge, faith, love, obedience, etc. and yet be in a good estate, though
he be put still to renew his Repentance from time to time, which (if I may so
speak) becomes so much the purer, like gold when it is often refined; by
ardent and often praying, again and again: therefore distressed Christians in
this case, have no just cause to be so perplexed and cast down as many times
they are.

Wherefore seeing it is necessary still to grow in Repentance, Exhortation to
Repentance
and that it can never be too pure nor perfect, not too often gone over in
this life; we must therefore labor, and every day endeavor to be more and
more penitent for our sins, bitterly to lament them, and increase in the
detestation and hatred of them: so making use both of the mercies and
judgments of God this way, as to further us in the growth of our repentance.
So we see Peter did, by occasion of Christ's mercy unto him in the draught of
fishes, Luke 5. 8. He fell down on his knees and said, depart from me, I am
but a sinful man o Lord! So did the Lords people by occasion of the judgment
in the Thunder and lightning, 1. Sam. 12. 19. say unto Samuel, Pray for thy
servants unto the Lord that we dye not, for we have added unto all our sins
this evil to take a King; thus must we grow in this as in other graces. It is
therefore a great corruption for any to desire to grow in other graces if this
be neglected, and to do some things conscionably, and to neglect those other
maine duties in Religion. For if one had a child, and the child should Child.
grow in one part and not in another; one hand and one leg should thrive, but
not the other, but keep still at a stand, how bitterly would he complain of
this; and yet so is it in the state of many a Christian, one part of the graces
of God grows well, but the other does not grow at all; many increase in
knowledge, show a great deal of zeal, of devotion, have sufficiency of faith
and are cheerful in their obedience, but they grow not a whit in Repentance,
they are not a whit more humbled for their sins, more penitent and cast down
before the LORD, and therefore can say, what cause have we to be dejected and
afflicted so for it? but let us of better knowledge, learn to be better
affected, our care being to be more and more humbled for our sins. We see
in Nature when a man is buried and laid in the Man buried.
ground, the more earth and mould you cast upon him, the more he consumes from
day to day, being so much the more unfit to rise up again, (suppose alive)
from under the weight and burden of the earth which presses him down. Even so
it is with the sin of a Christian: when a man has buried sin in himself,
the more he increases his repentance and holy humiliation, the more earth and
mold he casts upon it in this kind, the less able will it be to rise and
revive again: nay, our sad and serious Repentance will make it that it shall
not rise again. Now there be three ways wherein a Christian must increase in
the Grace of Repentance, as well as in other Graces.

1. In the Number of his Graces. 2. In the Measure of his Graces. 3. In the
good use of them.
1 In the number of Graces.
First for the Number of Graces; see what Peter says, 2. Pet. 1. 5. Add to
your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to
temperance Patience, and to patience godliness, etc. And so 2. Cor. 8. 7.
Therefore as ye abound in every thing, in faith and utterance and knowledge,
and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this Grace
also. Therefore it should grieve a Christian to hear a man speak of any grace
which he has not in himself. Fine and dainty Dainty women.
women we know who have a delight in curious gardens, if they hear of any
goodly Plant, or delicate Flower in another bodies garden, they never rest till
they have got a slip of it into their own: yea, here they beg a root and there
a slip, and so set it into the ground. Even so must a Christian do, because
his soul is the garden of Gods graces, therefore whatsoever grace of God he
hears of to be amongst others, by and by he must labor to get it home unto
himself, therefore it is great corruption for men to get some one grace of
God, and neglect the rest, to get a little knowledge, zeal, devotion, etc. and
yet never labor for a good conscience, sobriety, patience, faith, love, etc.
letting these things pass unrespected and unregarded: A Christian must be
like a little child, who every year grows somewhat, and adds to A Child.
his stature and growth in all proportion of parts not growing in one member,
and declining in another, so must Christians do; endeavor to thrive in all
graces.

2 In the measure of Graces.
Secondly, We must grow up in the measure of Graces, as the Apostle exhorts, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 1. 10. Furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exhort you by
the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to
please God, so ye would abound more and more. So 2. Pet. 3. 18. But grow in
grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Therefore if
we believe, let us believe more; if love, endeavor we for more; if patient,
let Patience have its perfect work (as S. James speaks) that we may be entire
and want nothing. We read Math. 13. 31. The graces of God are compared to a
little seed, not to a little stone, because though a seed be Seed.
little, yet it is of such a thriuing nature that it will not always be
little, but grow and increase to his limited stature and greatness: So the
thing is clear, a Christian must increase as well in the Measure as number of
Graces, be like the thriuing seed, not like to a little stone that grows no
bigger; which shows their fearful estate, who grow not in the measure of
their graces.

3 In the good use of them.
Thirdly, In the use of them, for one may have good Graces, and yet never put
them to any employment, like unto that unthrifty servant, Luke 19. 20. who
tied up his Talent in a napkin: and like that lame man by the Poole of
Bethesda, John 5. 7. who though he had legs, yet had no use of them until
Christ restored them: so we may have some graces of God, and no right use of
them, if we be not careful to rub them up and set them a work, wherefore the
Church prays, Cant. 4. 16. Awake o North, and come thou South, blow upon my
garden, that the spices thereof may flow out, let my beloved come into his
garden and eat his pleasant fruits. So Psalm. 119. 34. David prays, Give me
understanding and I shall keep thy law, yea I shall observe it with my whole
heart. Therefore as Mary not only brought a Box of ointment to Christ, so that
all the house was filled with the smell thereof: even so must we Ointment.
not only bring our Boxes of ointments, of graces unto Christ, but effuse and
pour them out, that God may smell the savor, and others may receive good by
them. If a man had a thousand Tun of wine in a Cellar, Wine.
which he had no use of, but were kept closely there, what were any man the
better for it? but if he would make a large Cisterne, and turn out a Conduite
cock into the street, that every one who passes by might drink thereof, then
would they commend his bounty, and be thankful unto him: So when we have
good graces of God which we keep to our selves, not being profitable unto
any, it is matter of rebuke and reproach, until we let the cock run to
water and refresh others.

One thing more is to be considered, for conclusion of all; which is,

How a Christian may grow in Grace?
For it may be many a one would be willing to grow in Grace, if they knew how;
being ready to think or say with the Jews unto Christ, John 6. 28. What shall
we John 6. 28.
do that we might work the work of God? So may ye say to me, you talk of
excellent duties, but how shall we perform them? To which I answer there be
four things to be performed of every one that would grow in Grace.

First, In the use of them to be careful that they may thrive and grow, as
the Apostle prescribes, 1. Pet. 2. 2. As newborn babes desire the sincere
milk of the word, that you may grow thereby. Seeds not watered nor weeded.
If one sow good seeds in his garden, and never water or weed them, or set up
sticks by them for their support and leading upwards, all his labor will be
in vain: So if one do not nourish the good seeds of Gods graces sowed in his
heart and soul, if he do not water, weed them, and set up supporters unto
them; a thousand to one that they will never thrive nor grow to any purpose.
Therefore we must do as the Iuie Iuie.
does, because the stalk thereof is weak, the string not being able to
support it to grow up straight, therefore it catches hold with his keys and
claws, upon every post and tree that it may climb up by. So because commonly
we all creep upon the ground, and be not able to lift up our souls unto
Heaven by our own strength; let us lay hold of the holy things of God, the
promises of the Gospel, and the merits of Christ; never leaving nor giving
them over, until they have lifted us up unto heaven.

We must use all the ordinary means, besides extraordinary graces and
prayer: for if we use some and neglect the rest, no marvel though God deny
his blessing to the rest: as if one use Prayer, and yet will not come to the
preaching of the Word; or if he hear the Word, and neglect the ^aments: this
man may miss of his aim and comfort: as the Disciples, Math. 17. 20. used
some means, but because they failed in other some in the matter of faith,
therefore they wanted a blessing on their work for that time. It must
therefore be our care and wisdom to use all the means which God has
appointed, as we know by experience, go to a Doctor for Doctor.
a pain in the head, he prescribes you four things for the remedy; of which
if you take but two, and neglect the other two, no good can be done; for when
you return to the Doctor and tell him, that you have only taken two of the
four things prescribed: no marvel may he say; you are not cured, who have
neglected the half of the means appointed for your cure: So it is, when men
will not betyed unto all the means which God has appointed.

We must use all the means constantly which may stand us chiefly in stead: as
it is Heb. 6. 7. For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often
upon it, and brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed,
receives blessing from God. If a man have found out an excellent plaster
which will cure his sore: if he pluck A Plaster.
it away and do not let it lie when he is on the mending hand, but expose it
to the air: He may relapse into a worser condition, or kill himself,: So
when a man has got some profit by the use of good means, if he do not then
keep to them, but grow loose and idle, he may fall into as bad estate as
before he knew of any cure: or much worse. Trees that grow by the sent of
water; if the water Trees.
be drawn from them, they cannot thrive thriuingly, as before: so take away
the constant use of good means from a Christian, and you take away his life,
he cannot thrive or grow.

We must so use all the means as we must be careful, and endeavor to be
bettered by them, and not only grow, but grow to a taste of perfection by the
use of them, as near as may be. According to the Apostles Exhortation, 2.
Cor. 6. 1. We then as workers together with him, beseech you also, that you
receive not the grace of God in vain. Therefore we must do as wise
merchants, Merchants.
who when they have made a venture at Sea, cast up their books, and look into
their accounts to see what they have gained. So Christians who bear a part in
the house of God, and traffic against sin with his graces, must cast up
their accounts, look into their books, see what they have gotten or gained,
what graces be the stronger, and what graces the more weakened in their hearts.

Lastly, it may be objected: is there now remaining any thing else to be said
in this Treatise of Repentance? I answer for my self; nothing else I have to
deliver unto you concerning this Treatise: only to entreat you that as one
having passed along a goodly pleasant long valley, Valley reuiew.
where he has seen on both sides great store of delightful Woods, Towns,
Castles, Rivers, etc. when he is ready to leave that plain, turns about to
view the place once more, and make impression thereof in his memory: so that
you (having passed along and heard so many excellent points in this doctrine of
Repentance,) would turn about again, once more to view them all ere we leave
them.

First, you have heard of the Necessity of Repentance, Sum of all.
that we cannot be saved without it. Secondly, The order of it with other
Graces; Repentance being first seen in the life of a Christian. Thirdly, The
Nature of Repentance, in which was four things; First, that it is a changing
and turning: Secondly, a turning in all and every faculty of the soul:
Thirdly, a turning from all sin^ Fourthly, a turning from all sin unto God.
Fourthly, The Causes of Repentance, were three: 1. God the Efficient Cause: 2.
The preaching of the Law and Gospel, the Isntrumental Cause. 3. The helping
Causes: the Mercies of God, his Judgments and our own considerations. Fifthly,
The Time of Repentance was twofold: General and Particular, in the General
two Rules. 1. That we must repent in this life. 2. That we must repent as soon
as we can. 2. In the special time of Repentance, were five Particulars: 1.
When we have fallen into any new sin. 2. When the judgments of God are
threatened against us: 3. When there is an offer of spiritual means of grace.
4. When we are to undertake any great work. 2. To renew our repentance every
morning and eueuing. Sixthly, The parts of Repentance in which four things was
observed: 1. Examination. 2. Humiliation. 3. Deprecation. 4. Resolution for the
time to come. Seventhly, The Impediments of Repentance, were two. First, in
Judgment. Secondly, in Affection: In Judgment four ways: First, either to
think our selves not sick of sin: or secondly sick, not so sick as indeed
we be. Thirdly, if sick, yet that we may recover without repentance; or
fourthly, if Repentance must needs be, yet that it needs not to be so full and
strict as Preachers tell us. Secondly, Impediments in our affections, were
first the love of the world. Secondly the love of pleasures. Thirdly, the love
of our own ease. Fourthly, the love of our sins. Fifthly, the desire to keep
credit with the world. Then we came to The Cases of Repentance, five in number:
First, the case of Relapse: Secondly, the Case of Iteration: Thirdly, the Case
of Restitution: Fourthly, the Case of Tears: Fifthly, the Case of Comfort in
death. Ninthly, The Contraries to Repentance. First Impenitencie. Secondly,
unsound Repentance. Lastly, the Increase of Repentance, in two things: First,
that Repentance can never be but imperfect in this life: Secondly, wherein it
fails?

Thus have I, according to that ability God gave, endeavored to cast the seed
of God into your hearts, now your wisdom ^^st b^ to water it, when you are at
home in your houses, that as my pains has been to preach it unto you, so
yours may be to remember and make a right use thereof; and so I end, beseeching
God that the memory of these things may remain with you till your dying day.
That as every day you sin, so every day you may so renew your Repentance, as
Peter speaks, Act. 3. 19. That your sins may be blotted out, when the times
of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.

FINIS.
