The Second Edition.

By NICOLAS BIFEILD Preacher of GODS word at Isle worth in Middlesex.

LONDON Printed by E. Griffin for N. Butter near St Austens gate. 1618.

To the noble Knight, Sr HORRACE VERE, General of the English-forces in the
Low Countries. AND To the most worthy Lady, the Lady MARY VERE his Wife, my
most respected and religious Parishioners.
THere are three things incite me, to Dedicate this little direction to your
Lordship and my Lady: The first is to testifi^ hereby unto the world my
unfeigned estimation of those saving grace and the true religion that dwells in
you both The second is, to ex press hereby my great desire to show my
thankfulness, for the many favors I have received, but especially for all
the encouragements wherewith I have been refreshed in observing your love to
my Ministry, aad care in your selves and your family to show the profit of
it. The third is, because it pleased your Lordship and my Lady heretofore, to
desire and accept directions of this kind from me, in writing.

I have been the willinger to suffer this copy to come into public view,
because I have been urged by many friends from diverse places of late, to give
them Directions of this kind: and I have long observed that in the most places
the godly that are unlearned, are at a great want of a settled course herein. If
it may please your Lordshippe and my Lady to afford this little work, your
acceptance and countenance, I shall be richly satisfied. My hope is that the
Lord that has as it were called for it by the request of many well disposed,
will be pleased to give a blessing to it: if any thing be now wanting, by the
intimation of my friends, I may make further supply in after Editions, if God
will.

The Lord multiply grace and joy with righteousness and peace in both your
hearts and lives, and prolong with increase your Lordships honor and good
success in your military calling, in which you have been hitherto a special
ornament to this Nation. I end and rest

Yours in the service of my ministry to be commanded, N: BIFEILD.

The Preface.
THESE directions for reading the SCRIPTVRES contain three things. First
Analyticall tables, concerning the order of the whole SCRIPTVRES, and the
several books and Chapters gathered to this end, that the Reader might before
he reads, mark the drift of each book and Chapter, and when he has read,
might with singular ease and delight remember, what he has read. The second
is a Calendar, showing what number of chapters are to be read every day, that
so the whole Bible might be read over in a year. The number of Chapters,
while you are reading the old Testament is for the most part three a day, and
when you come to the new Testament, it is but two: Sometimes where the matter
is Historical, or Typical, or the chapters short, I have set down a greater
number. The third thing is the Rules for observation of profitable things in
reading. Many complain of their not profiting in reading, and some weak
Christians afflict their hearts maruellously with grief and fear, because
they cannot read with more comfort and profit, when the fault is not in their
affection to the word, so much as in their want of direction for their reading.

Concerning these Rules I consider both the matter, and the manner of using
them. For the matter, he that comes to read the Scriptures, should especially
set himself to observe two things: First the most needful places to enlarge
his own knowledge, and further his own growth in the true grace of God.
Secondly such places, as might warrant his practice in the things, the world
usually cauills at and reprocheth his profession for: as if he did not what
were necessary to do. There are some things in all places objected against the
godly. Now it is a thing of admirable use in our reading to gather under the
several heads such places, as may establish our hearts with abundance of
assurance, that we do nothing out of preciseness and curiosity in those
things: but merely at the commandment of God. And the Scriptures are so
apparent, and easy to be discerned, and so many in number, that the simplest
Reader may gather great store of testimonies.

Now for the first of these, that is, such places as might most profit me in my
particular reading: I would bring this mind to the Scriptures. (I will but
give a taste here.)

First it were a thing of admirable use all my life long, if I did set down
all the places of Scripture, that in the reading I find sensible comfort and
rauishing of heart in: It may be in the whole Bible I may find 20. 40. 50.
etc. of such places, as I was sure in the reading did wonderfully fill my heart
with secret refreshing, and sensible joy: Now these places so noted, not only
serve for present use, but while I live, in any distress, I may have recourse
to these, as so many wells of joy, and if in my grief one, or two, or ten of
them did not comfort me: yet a thousand to one some of them will have spirit
and life in them to refresh me again in any sorrows: Besides, it maruellously
establishes my faith, when I remember, in how many distinct places of
Scripture the Lord was pleased to comfort me in particular. This is one thing
now we should observe.

Secondly would it not be exceeding profitable; If I did note all the places of
scripture which in reading of them did sensibly smite my heart, and reprove
some fault in me, so as I felt my heart troubled within me? Certainly by
that time I had gone through the Scriptures, I should see the Anatomy of my
corruptions, and plainly perceive, what things there were in my nature, that
God had a quarrel against: and so might be guided by the very finger of God
to know the faults, I should set my self most against in mortification.

Thirdly, in reading one shall find sometimes certain rules or counsels
given, which one sensibly is affected withal, and has an inward desire, Oh
that I could but remember this counsel of the holy Ghost, Now I would note all
those places, that the holy Ghost made me in love withal in the reading, that
might concern my own particular direction either at home, or abroad.

Again, the most people in the midst of these extreme differences of opinions
on all sides, feel sometimes a wonderful desire, such as this, O that I could
tell but some certain way what to believe, and then let all the world contend,
if they will: Now for this I would mark all those apparent places, that
contain evident ground of truth, against which there can be in my conscience
no cavil, but I could live and die in the assurance, that that is the will of
God. It is incredible, how the simplest may settle themselves herein, in all
the fundamental points of religion. If thou find of these but 20. 30. 40. or
50. places in the whole Bible; thou can not now believe, how it will settle
thee: As for example, 1. Ioh. 5. he faith, There are three in heaven, the
Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and these three are one. All the world now
should never make me doubt of the Trinity in unity. When I had gotten those
grounds, those I would stick to^, and for other questions, let them wrangle
while they will, I would receive further light when I saw it clear, but their
quarrelling should not much trouble me. And thus I might go on with the
particulars of the first sort of rules, but these shall suffice to give light
to the course.

Now for the second sort of Rules one may find in every place certain things,
strongly objected against the practice of the godly: As for example, that they
deserve to be hated, because they will not keep company with their
neighbors, and because they stand so precisely upon small matters, as lesser
oaths, and doing slight works upon the sabbath day, and such like: and
besides, many men are afraid to enter upon such a course of life, because it
is a way so evil spoken of, and reproched in the world etc. Now for my own
establishment I would mark, where my course differed from other men, and in
reading I would gather evident places, that might warrant my practice: As for
example, places that justify the avoiding of the company of the wicked, and so
again places, that show, that the sincere practice of godliness has been ever
liable to the scorns, reproaches, and slanders of the world. And so of the
rest.

Now for the manner of using these rules, I think, thou may profitably follow
these directions. First make thee a little paper book of a sheet or two of
paper, as may be most portable: then write upon the top of every leaf the
title for that that thou would observe in reading. Choose out only six or
eight titles out of the whole number of such at for the present thou have most
need to observe: or only so many as thou art sure thy memory will easily carry
to thy reading, whether more or fewer. In reading observe only such places as
stare thee in the face, that are so evident, thy heart cannot look of them.
Trouble not thy self with that objection, that there are many things which
thou can not discern, take thou only such as thou can not pass over,
they are so clear and evident. In noting the places, set down under each
title only the book, Chapter, and verse, and not the words, for that will tire
thee in the end: As for example, would I observe all the hard places, which in
reading I have a desire to know the meaning of, that so when I come into the
company of Preachers or able Christians, I might have profitable questions to
propound: I would set it down thus, Hard places,
Malach. 4. 5.
Malach. 2. 6.
And so of other places: for I give these on the sudden but for instance
sake. Now when thou have done thy quarters task, or thy years task, then
thou may write out the th^isest things, as thou think good, and in the
mean time have the use of the places for turning to. And if thou should in
reading, of thy self remember some title, which thou have not in this
direction, and yet have a great desire to observe places of that kind, by any
means write it down, whilst thou think of it, and custom in observing
will make thee able to be thine own Directour hereafter. Look not at the
profit of this course the first week, or month: but consider, how rich it will
make thee at the years end. I am persuaded, if thou fear God, thou would
not sell thy collections for a great price, after thou have gathered them, if
it were but for the good, they may do thee in the evil day, when it shall
come upon thee.

Farewell, the Lord give thee a blessing, and pray thou for me, and remember
before thou read to lift up thy heart to God in some short eiaculations, to beg
his blessed assistance, and take heed thou be not unthankful to God for the
success.

By all means strive to keeepe a delight in thy course, and let not thy heart
be too apt to discouragement: but rejoice in the Lord. Again farewell: the
Lord keep thee till the day of Christ.

The order of the Books, and of reading the whole SCRIPTVRES.
THe Book you are to read is the Bible: your Bible is divided into 2: parts,
