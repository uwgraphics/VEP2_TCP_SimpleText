TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, THE LORDS OF HIS MAJESTY'S most honorable privey
Counsel.
I have set forth (Right Honorable) sundry books, institutions for Jews in
our Christianity. Two, of Epistles, printed before A. D. 1599. and the one in
seven languages. The other Arch. Wh. caused to be translated. The matter of
them I need not to tell. An other work is but part Ebrew: in a commentary upon
Ecclesiastes: and that is translated so much as in English might be. An other
is joined in argument: that Salomons family ended in the Kings: and thence
Nathans was afflicted: even unto the afflicting of our Lord: and of Christians
300 years. That, I have translated into Greek: and into Latin for Europe. And
I think that no Romist, or Law of England will blame any position of it. An
other is altogether against the Jews, for disturbing the holy story wilfully;
that the redemption time should not appear. That work neded not to be
translated for England: because I opened every position of it to England before.
All these books I made for the honor of the King: that all Jews and Gentiles
bettered by them, should pray for the King and the Kings children. And them I
commend to your Lordshipes care, to be regarded according to the sage honor of
his Majesty's government.

Your Lordships most humble: Hugh Broughton.
