Here begins a treatise of the smyth which that forged him a new dame.
the smith and his assistant forging a new wife

GOd that dyed on a tree
He glad them al with his gle
That will harken unto me
And here what I will say
And ye shall here a marvel
Of a tale I shall you tell
How in Egypt it befell
And in that same countraye
Some time there dwelled a smyth
that had both land and lyth
Many a plowman him with
By night and eke by day
the smyth was a subtle syer
For well could he work with the fire
what men of him would desyer
I tell you troth by my fay
He could work with a mall
Many manner of metal
Him self master did he call
wythouten any pere
Much boste began he blow
And said he had no fellow
that coud work worth a straw
To him far nor nere
He called him self the king
without any leafynge
Of all manner of cunning
And of certes clear
Till it befell upon a day
Our lord came there away
And thought the smyth to assay
as ye shall after here
For his pomp and his pride
That he blewe in each side
Our lord thought at that tide
His pride should be laid
As the smyth stood workynge
To him came our heaven king
Now he that made all thing
Speed the he said
He said I have a thing to make
And thou wylt it under take
And do for my sake
Thou shall be well paid
the smyth said so mote I the
tell on and let me se
It shall be done full wyghtely
within a lyttel brayed
For I am master of all
That smyteth with hamer or mall
And so may thou me call
I tell the for very
I saw him never with mine eye
That could work like I
I tell the full truly
By night ne by day
Can thou make a yerde of stele
To lead a blind man well
Our lord began to say
And make it so with thy mall
That he shall never stomble ne ^all
Than a master I will the call
Sir by my fay
The smyth than in a stody stood
Said I trow thou be wode
Or else thou can but little good
To talk of such a thing
And he be blind he must need
Have a fellow him to lead
That may se well in deed
to keep him fro falling
For and two blind me^ together go
Full often they fall both two
It must needs be so
they have no manner of seeing
How should a blind dotarde
walk with a blind yard
If it be stele never so hard^
It is but a very leasing
It were a little maystry
To make a blind man to se
As such a yerde truly
wythouten any layne
yes said our lord that I can
Make such yerde certain
Or he that is an old man
to make him young again
The smyth said so mote I the
I have an old quayne with me
Mine old beldame is she
I tell the without any layne
It is forty winter and mo
Sith on foot she did go
And thou coud make her young so
than would I be feign
Our lord said where is she
Anon let me her se
And thou shall se a maystre
More than thou can
the smyth said so mote I the
I shall her fetch unto the
Anon than full wyghtely
After her the smyth ran
And said dame slepest thou
I am come for the thou may me trow
Thou shall be made now
Again a young woman
He hent her up than on hye
Than set she forth a loud cry
And said strong thief let me ly
Thou art I trow a mad man
Let me lie thou unthrifty swayne
She shall be made at a brayd
Young now again
the smyth blewe as god bed
Till she was reed as a gled
yet for all that deed
Felt she no manner of pain
The smith said now is she she^t
Both her eyes are out brent
they will never be meant
Our works are all in vain
She has had such a hete
She will never eat mete
I have blow on till I sweet
withouten any layne
Our lord said let me alone
thou shall se and that anon
a full fair woman
Of this old wight
Our lord blessed her at a brayd
and on the styth he her laid
Take thy hamer he said
Dame I shall the wake
and make her now right
with a hamer he her struck
No bone of her he brake
She was a byrd bright
Stand up now let me se
Than at that word rose she
a fair woman truly
and semely unto sight
Our lord laid to the smyth
She is sound of lymme and lyth
Now I have made her on the styth
with hamer and with mall
Than was she loueseme of there
Bright as blosome on brere
None in Egypt her pere
So fair and so tall
Her color was clear
She seemed but thyrty year
She was whiter of lere
Than bone is of whale
than our lord began say
Now is here a fair may
Smyth by night and by day
thy master thou me call
Now may thou se here in sight
Hole and of lym light
That was before an old wight
Both crooked foot and hand
Gramercy sir said she
For thou have wrought on me
It was a full great maystry
As I understand
I was blind now may I se
Crooked I was truly
Now may I walk wyghtly
My bales are vnbande
Such a smyth as thou art one
I dare say here is none
And a man should gone
Through out this land
For I dare say that thou can
if here were a dead man
Make him on live anon
with thy excelent maystry
Than the smyth began say
Sir what shall I to the pay
Or thou wend thy way
thy craft to teache me
Our lord said than to him again
that thou desyrest is all in vain
Thought you would never so feign
yet will it never be
Thou shall never if thou would
Make an young man of an old
Therefore be not to bold
Leest it do disceyue thee
yet thou toldest me long ere
Thou were wysest man of leere
that was known any where
Other far or else nere
Farewell now and have good day
I must forth we^de on my journey
Into an other country
Among many crafts there
And leave thy bostes I read the
For I tell the now treuely
Is none so wise ne to sle
But ever ye may some what lere
The second fytte.
NOw lysten syrs at a sent
And ye will now my tale tent
How the smith his dame bre^t
In the next fyt ye shall here
when our lord was gone
The smyth rathely and and anon
Called on his dame Ione
And bad her com on fast
A none she answered tho
Thou wotest I may not go
whereto cryest thou so
Is thy wit past
I am crooked and also lame
And now to go it is no shame
age does me much grame
Me thinks my bones brast
Thou wotest well I may no se
almost I am as blind as a be
And if I bye me truly
To fall I am aghast
The smyth hand on her laid
Come forth dame he said
thou shall be made at a brayd
young and lusty again
thy dame is young again I wys
She is mended of her mysse
Her rudde redder it is
Than the rose is in rain
that is a lyequod she
I faith that will never be
She is blind of that one eye
Her bones are vnbayne
The smyth said lo she is here
the sweet dame that the bear
She is louesome of there
wythouten any layne
Art thou my mother said she
ye said she truly
Than said she benedicite
who has made the thus
anon to her began she say
I was made thus to day
with one that came by the way
Men call his name Jesus
Now truly than said she
He has amended well thy ble
For yester day so mote I the
thou were a foul sose
Dame said the smyth tho
I can make the yonde so
Had I a fire brennynge blo
But now thou must help us
than the symth at a brayed
A quarter of coals on he laid
Let us blow now he said
till all be on glede
And thou shall se dame in hy
a craft for the maystry
Full few men can it but I
I tell the truth in deed
why what wylt thou do with me
Dame brenne the said he
Nay not so said she
Christ it forbid
To brenne me were a shrewde game
wottest not thou knave whom I am
Thief I am thine own dame
Evil mote thou speed
Traitor and thou brenne me
Thou shall be hanged on a tree
My malyson I give thee
would thou me slo
God let thee never eat bread
Would thou have thy dam deed
touch me not I thee read
For both thine eyes two
The first time I thee see
I would I had throtled thee
Now thou would brenne me
And work me this woe
I tell thee by sweet saint John
thou shall have my malyson
But thy hamer anon
thou cast thee fro
Much woe have thou wrought
I kept the when thou were naught
Fostred and forth the brought
Full often did I make
Dame said the smyth I trow
Old shrewe it is for thy prowe
that on this wise now
young I shall thee make
Anon se that thou shall
Had I my hamer and mimall
I would make the full tall
And young I undertake
He laid hand on hit tho
Than she spurnedat him so
that his shynnes both two
In sonder she there brake
Than the smyth began to stare
And said daine god give the care
what aylest thee thus to fare
I trow thou art wode
young full soon I can make thee
And that anon thou shall se
I am waxen now full crafty
I tell thee by the rode
Thou spe^dest now and may not pay
Thou have lain full many a day
By the wall for so the I thee say
And can do no good
Full fast the fire began he blow
And said be thou never so throw
I shall amend the son I trow
Of bone and eke of blood
She said sir by saint Ihone
Of thy mendyng keep Inone
Therefore let me alone
And touch me no more
yes said he that I mote
Come for the old dote
She catched him by the throat
That blood out began fate
As he drew her nere
She set her foot against a spear
And said thief wylt thou me dear
God give the care
He cast her on the smythes stock
And than she hent him by the lock
And gave him many a great knock
She spared not the bare
Ever she sporned with her foot
In hand a hamer she gate
And knocked him above the pate
the blood began out brast
And she tapped at him then
Strong thief she said I shall the ken
thine own dame for to brenne
She bette upon him fast
there she had welny
Stryken out his one eye
though the smyth bygge be
Of her he was abashed
Stefly on her fete she stood
and smote on him as she were wode
the smyth ran on reed blood
All to rent and rasshed
the smyth at a brayd
would her in the fore have laid
Nay thief tho she said
Yet will I not come there
Help some good man said she
this thief will brenne me
Anon than full myghtely
She caught him by the here
Of his locks began she pull
Many great handfu^l
Rent the skyn from the skull
The pan began appear
She said thief let me go
wylt thou thy dame slo
Loud out cried she tho
That many a man might here
the smyth than in have
water on the coals cast
The fire he blewe full fast
and made it brenne full bright
The smyth angered with that
Cast her in the fire flat
All way fast began she scrat
at him with all her might
Into the fire he her thrast
and said I hold thy wit past
Old shrowe at the l^st
Thou shall be new dyght
wha^ he had smored her in y^ smok
Out of the fire he her took
She had none eyes for to look
For lost was her sight
He laid her on the stythe a long
and with an hamer he on throng
that both her arms of spronge
Than waxed he vnfayne
and said so ever eat I meat
thou shall have a better heat
Mo coals began he get
To blow he was full feign
the fire sparkeled and spronge
He cast on water some times among
and said yet I hope to make the young
without any layne
Than he heut her up on hy
And laid her on the stethy
And hamered her strongely
with strokes that were vngayne
Fast on her he laid
Wax young dame he said
than both her legs at a brayd
Fell sone her fro
what evil hayle said he
wylt not thou young be
Speak now let me se
And say ones bo
Than he took her by the heed
And said dame art thou deed
Speak now in this steed
And say ye or else nay
Though both thy legs be away
yet speak pardy thou may
Say on dame I the pray
Felest thou any woe
Dame I have lost on the
Much labor truly
Now and thou deed be
So fair must me be fall
Loud on her he can cry
And said dame speak on hye
Or by my troth truly
Brenne thee up I shall
what can thou nothing say
I hold^ thee deed by this day
Her arm^ anon he threw away
Even against the wall
And lightly his way he went than
After Jesus fast he ran
As he had been a mad man
And full fast kan him call
And said for saint charity
Abide now and speak with me
But thou me help truly
My cares are full cold
My own dame I have slain
I would have made her young again
all my labor was in vain
Her legs would not hold
Our lord said verament
Have thou thy dame brent
He said lord she is shent
But if thou help would
Our lord said go we full yare
Yet I bad the long care
Of such craft to beware
And be not to bold
A good lord said he
I cry the heartily mercy
I would have wrought after the
and learned of thy lore
Said our lord go thy way
Now thou do me pray
I shall help that I may
Her for to restore
A none as he her se
He blessed her full fayrely
And bad her stand upon hy
anon she rose up there
She seemed young and not old
Bright as blossom her to behold
Fayrer by a thosand fold
Than she was before
She was white as a bone of whale
Bryghter then be tall
Than to the earth began she fall
And thanked god intere
The smyth had good game
And fetched forth his beldame
Than they all three in same
Kneled there in fere
And held up their hands on hy
And thanked god with all their might
That he had them so dyght
And mended their chere
Our lord said to the smyth tho
Look thou brenne never mo
For this craft I shall tell the
Can thou never lere
But here a point I give the
The master shall thou yet be
Of all thy craft truly
Without any delay
What man of craft so ever be
And he have no help of the
Though he be never so sle
warke not he may
Than our lord forth went
And bad the smyth take good tent
That he no me folk brent
By night nor yet by day
Our lord thus forth began go
And left them together so
and did many a marvel mo
In diverse countries
He made many a crooked right
And gave blind men again their sight
Dead men through his might
He raised full sone again
Leprous made he clear
Defe men for to here
and other sycknesses in fere
He heled them certain
all sick men that to him sought
and to him that were brought
and loved lely in their thought
And were losed of their paynt
Pray we all to him this
That such a lordy is
That he bring us to blys
That never shall mys. Amen.
Thus ends the game
How the smyth brent his dame
and after made again
By our blessed lord
