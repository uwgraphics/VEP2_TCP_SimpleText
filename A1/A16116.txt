A compendious old treatise / showing / how that we ought to have ye
scripture in English /

Thexcusacyon of ye treatise

Though I am old / clothed in barbarors wede
Nothing garnysshed with gaye eloquency
Yet I tell the troth / if ye list to take heed
Against their froward / furious frenesy
Which reckon it for a great heresy
And unto lay people grievous outrage
To have gods word in their natyfe langage.
Enemies I shall have / many a shoren crown
With forked cappes and gaye croosys of gold
Which to maynteyne there ambicions renown
Are glad lay people in ignorance to hold
Yet to show the verite / one may be bold
All though it be a proverb daily spoken
Who that tellyth troth / his head shall be broken
depiction of four women at fountain

Unto the Reader.
GRace and peace: not that the world geuyth / but from god the father and our
savior Jesus Christ with increace of ye holy spryt be with the and all that
thirst the truth. Amen.

Co^syderynge the malyciousnes of our prelatz and their adherentes which so
furiously bark against the word of God / and specially the new testament
translatyd and set forth by Master William Tyndale / which they falsely
prete^de to be sore corrupt. That ye may know that yt is not Tyndales
translacyo^ yt moves the^ but only the inward malice which they have ever
had against the word of God. I have here putt in prynte a tretyse written
about the year of our lord a thousand four hundryd. By which thou shalt
plainly perceive / that they would yett never from the beginning admytte any
translacio^ to the lay people / so that it is not yt corrupt tra^slacio^ that
they withstonde. For if that were true y^ idle bellyes would have had leyser I
nowgh to put forth another well tra^slatyd. But yt is their own myscheuous
living yt mouyth the^ according as Christ said Ihon^.iij. Every man that
workyth evil hatyth ye light / ner comyth to the light lest his works should
be reproved. etc.

Thus may thou se that because their works (...) ^^ght and not because yt is
evil translatyd / (...) furiously resyste the word of god which is ye true
light. For yet was there never none tra^slatyd but other with falshed or tyranny
they putt yt down. Wherefore I exhort the reder not to consydre and note the
words but the manner. And pray to god to send the rulers hearts to
understood the truth and further the same and the god of all comfort be with
the Amen.

This treatise more tha^ an.C. year old
Declares how owre prealatis do far a mysse
Which of froward presumpcion are so bold
To forbede the word of god in english
For as the prophet says blyssed he is
That exercyseth him self diligently
In scripture night and day continually Psalm. i.

FOr to make upon Anticrist I take figure of king Antioche of whom gods law
speakythe in ye book of Machabeijs / for right as king Antioche came in ye
end well nygh of the old law / and brent the books of gods law / and
compelled the people to do maumentry. So now Anticrist ye king of clergy that
lynen worse then hethen prestes bre^nerh now nyghe the^de of the new law and
theva^gely of Christ that is nyghe ye end of the world to deceive well nyghe
all the world and ^^^^^ue the servants of god. For now god shall (...) we
who will stand by his law for Satan^ (...) prophets say is now vnbonde and
has been CCCC. yeris and more for to in habit ower clergy / as he did the
clergy of the old law / but now with much more malice. Ye may se it is no
novelteis that the bishops burn the gospel.
For as they dampened Christ so now ower bysshope dampne and bren gods law /
for because it is drawyn into ower mother tongue. etc. It owght to be and we
savyd should be as we shall preue by open evidence thoroughe gods help. First
we take witness of Boethius de disciplina scolarium / that says that
childerne should be tawght in the books of Seneke. And Bid expounds this
sainge / and says that childerne in virtues should be tawght. For the books
of Seneke ben moralles and for they be not taught thus in there youth they
continue still evil maneryd and be unable to conceive the subtyle science of
truth saing / the wise man is as a clean myrror new pullisshed. Read Robin
hode say our masters.
Wisdem shall not enter into a wicked soul. And much is hereof the sentence of
Bid. And Algasell in his logyke says / the soul of man is as a clean mirror
new pullysshed in which is seyn lightly ye image of virtue. And for the people
has not cunning in youth they have dark sowles and blinded with ignorance /
so that they proffyt not in virtue / but in falsnes and malice and other vices
and much is there of ye matter. Sythen hethen philosophers wolden the people to
proffit in natural science / how much more should Christen clerks will the
pepyll to profyt in science of virtues / for so would good. For when the law
was geuyn to Moses in the mount of Synay / god gave it to his people i^ there
mother to^^^ of Ebrue / that all the people should understand (...) and
commanded Moses to read it to them until they understood it / and so he did
as it is plain Deutero. xxxi. And Esdras also read it in their mother tongue /
fro morrow until none as it is plain in the first book of Esdras Cap. viij. And
he read it apertly in the streate and the earys of ye people were intentysly
gevyn thereto / in so much that the people fell into great weping for the
miskeping of the law. Also gods law says Deuter. xxxij. that fathers
should make the law known to their sons and the sons that should be borne
of the^ should rise and teach these things to there sons. And the holy
apostle saint Peter in ye fourth chapter of his first book speakyth after this
manner / saying. Who so ever speak / speak he as the words of god: and every
man as he has takyn grace of knowing / so ministre he forth to other men It
is written plainly in the book of noumbres the eleventh chapter. When ye
prophet Moses hade chosen seventy elder men / and the spryt of god rested on
them and they prophesyed. Two men besides them / Eldad / and Medad / prophesyed
in ye tents / and Iosue the ministre of Moses said to Moses / forbed thowe
them. moses let no man to prophesye.
And Moses said what enuiest thou for me? Who shall let yt all the people
prophesye / if god give them his spirit? Also it is read in the gospel that
saynct Ihon evangelist said unto Christ / lord we shall forbid (...) that
castith out spiryttes in thy name / which folowith not us. Luc. ix
And Christ said do not forbede / for who so is not against us is with us. And
unto the same agreyth well the prophesy of Iohe^ which saint Petre preachinge
to the Jews strongly allegyd as Luke recyteth in the secounde chapitre of the
acts of the apostles saying after this manner. That godde now in the last
days shall shed out his spirit upon every flesh.

For god says your sons and daughters should prophecy / and your young men
shall se visyons. But they say only master doctor can understand ye scripture
And upon whit sunday god gave knowledge of his law to diverse nations with
out annye excepcyons in there mother tongue / by the understanding of one tunge.
And of this it is notabyll sithen the lay people in the old law had there
law in there mother tongue / yt the lay english people in ye new law have it
as all other nacyons has / sithe Christ bowght us as he did other and has
gevyn to us y^ same grace as to other. For saint Peter. Actu. xi. was reprevyd
for he had baptized Cornelij / and his felows yt were hethen me^. And Peter
answered and said. If god have gevyn ye same grace to the^ that he hatheto us
/ who am I that may forbyde god? As who says it lyethe not in ye power of
men. Than who art thou that forbyddest the people to have gods law in there
mother tongue? we say yt thou art Anticrist him self. For Paul says.i.
Corin. x. I will every man to speak with tounges / more for sothe to prophesy
/ also he says how shall he say Amen apo^ thy blessyng that wortes not what
thou say. Apo^ this says doctor Lyre. If the people understood the prayer
of the pressed it shall the better be ladde unto god / and the more devoutly
answer Amen. Here you re own master Lyre if ye will not here Paul.
Also Paul says in the same chapter. I will rather fyve words to be spokyn
to the understanding of men then ten thousand that they understand not.
And.lxx. doctors with other mo before the incarnacion of Christ translatyd the
bible out of Ebrewe into Greek. And after the asce^sion many ^ra^slated all the
bible in diverse la^gages / as into spanyshetunge frenshetunge / and al main /
italy and by many years have hade it. It was hard of a worthy man of Almayn
that y^ same time was a fle^myng whose name was James Merla^d which translated
all the bible into flemyshe. For which deed he was somo^ned be fore the pope
of great malice. And the book was takyn to examinacion. And truly he approuyd
it. And then it was delyverd to him again into confusion of all his enemies.
Wurshupfull Bid in his first book called de gestis Angloru^. chapter. iij.
rellyth that saint Oswolde the King of Northu^berlande asked of the skottes an
holy bishop Aida^ to preach to his people / and ye king him self
interpretyd it in English to the people. Sythe^ this blessed dead of this
King is alowede of all holy Church / why not now owght it as well to be
allowed a man to read the gospel in Englisshe to the people / sythen that
saint Paul says if ower gospel be hid / it is hid in the^ that shall be
dampened. A fearful saying.
And he says also he that knows not shall not be knowyn of good. And
therefore venerabilis Bid led by the spirit of good translated a great
part of the bible into english. Who se originalles ben in many abbeys in
yngland. And Cistercienc. li. v. ca. xxiiij. says that the euuangely of Ihon^
was drawn into english by ye foresaid Bid which euuangely of Ihon^ and
other gospels ben yet in many places of so old english that skant can annye
english man read them. For this Bid reygnyd in the year of owen lord
god.vij. hundred and.xxxij. Also Cisterciencis. li. vi. ca. i. says that king
Alred ordyned open scolys of diverse arts in Oxforde and he turnyd the best
laws into his mother tongue and the psalm ^er also / he reyhgned in the year of
owre lord god viij. hundred.lxxiij. And saint Thomas says super libr^^
politicoru^ expounyng this word barbarus / y^ barbarus is he yt vndstondyth
not yt hereadyth in his mother tongue. Wherefore the apostle says if I know not
y^ virtue of yt voice to whom I speak I shall be to him barbarus / yt is to
say / he vndsta^deth not what I say / ne I what he says And so all tho
prestes yt vndsto^de^ not what they readyn by there mother tongue be called
barbarus / and therefore Bid did draw into englisshe liberal arts lest
english men should be come barbarus / hec Thomas. Also Lincoln. says in a
sermon yt begynnyth / Scriptu^ est delenitis. If any priest say he ca^ne not
preach / one remedy is / resign he up his bu^fyce. Resign in no wise but
apo^ a good pension
Another remedy if he will not thus / record he in yt weke yt nakyd text of
the sunday gospel yt he have ye gross storye and tell it to the people / yt
is if he vndsto^d late^ / and do he this every weke in ye year he shall profyt
much. For thus preachyd ower lord saying / Ihon^.vi. The words that I
speak to you be spirit and life. If he do not vndsto^de late^ go he to one of
his neighbors yt vndstondeth / which will charctably expoune it to him / and
thus edifye he his floke. Upon this argues a great clarke and says / if it
be laufull to preach yt naked text to ye people / it is also lefull to write
and read it to the^. Also sire Wyllia^ Thorisby archebishope of York did do
draw a tretyse in english by a worshypfull clerk whose name was ^^^^ryke /
in the which were contained the articles of byleve / the.vij. dedly sins /
the.vij. works of mercy / the.x. co^maundme^tes. The same treatise is i^ ^
church over against London stone at this hour
And sent the^ in small pagynes to ye co^m^n people to learn it and to know it
/ of which yet many a copye be in yngland. Also Richerd the heremyte of
Hampole drew into english the psalter with a gloss and the lessons of dirige
and many other treatyces / by y^ which many english men have been greatly
edyfyed And they be cursed of good yt wolde^ let ye people to be lewder the^
they ben. But many me^ now be like unto ye fre^des of Hiob / yt whiles they
enforsed to deffende god they offendyd in him grievously. And thowgh such as be
slain do miracles / n^^^^theles they ben stynking matters. This says Richerd
ye heremyt expounyng this verse / Ne auferas de oremeo verbu^ veritatis vsque
quaque. This prophesye of Christ must be fulfilled take heed
And Christ says yt me^ should deame the^ self to do great (...) service to
god in kylling of his people. Arbitratur se obsequiu^ prestare deo. etc. Also a
man of London whose name was Wyrynge hade a bible in english of northe^
speech which was seyn of many men and it semyd to be.CC. years old. Also it
is known to many me^ in ye time of king Richerd ye.ij. yt into a parlyame^t
was putt a bylle by thassent of.ij. archebysshoppes and of ye clergy to adnulle
ye bible yt time translated into english with other english bookee of
thexposicio^ of yt gospels which when it was hard and seyn of lords and of
ye como^s. The duke of la^caster Ihon^ answered there to tyght sharply saying
this sentence / we will not be refuse of all other nations. For sithe they have
gods law which is ye law of ower belefe i^ there own la^gage / we will have
owres in english who so ever say nay. ^^pocrisie is the nature of all
bisshoppes.
And this he affer^^^^ with a great oath. Also Thomas Aru^dell ar^^^bysshoppe
of Caunterbury said in a sermon at west mester / or yt buryeng of Queen / Anne
/ yt it was more joy of her tha^ of any woman yt ever he knew For she an
alien borne had in english all ye.(...) gospels with the doctors upon them.
And he said that she had sent the^ to him to examyn / and he said that they
were good and true. And he blamyd in that sermon sharply the negligence of the
prelates / and other me^ / In so much that he said that he would leave up the
office of Chaunceler and forsake wordly busynes / and give him to fulfill his
pastoral office / for that he hade seyn / and read in tho books. Never trust
bishop as long as he keeps his possessions
And after this promise he became the most cruel enemy that might be against
english books. And therefore as many men said god smot him with a cruest
'dethe as he did also Rycherd flemyng bishop of lyncolne. And yet ower
bysshoppes ben so indurate and so far strayed from god that they have no
grace one to beware of another / but prowdly against all reasons and evidence
of gods laws / and doctors sentences / they brenne gods wordethe which
has brought this realm to undoing for ever but if gods grace be the more /
Where is yt ancient blood yt was in england in these days.
for this cruel dead is cause of pestilence / hungers / wars / and that
also this realm shall be conqueryd in short time / as saint Edward the king and
confessor prophesyethe in his book that begynnith thus / Sa^ctus Edwardus rex
vidit spiritualibus oculis. ercete. And therefore it were good to the King and
to other lords to make some remedy against this co^stitucyon of Antechrist
that says it is unlawful to us english men to have in english gods la^^
^^d therefore he brennythe and sleythe the^ that ^^^^teyne this good dead / Et
nu^c reges intelligite erudimini qui iudicatis rerram.
and that is for default that the king and lords known not ne will not
knowether own office in mea^tena^ce of god and his law. For as saint Austen
says the King with his knights representyn the godhede of Christ and
prestes the manhood of Christ / Rex est vicartus diuinitatis / et sacerdos est
vicarius Christi humanitatis / hec Augustinus in de questionibus veteris et
noue legis.ca. xci. And if the king would desyer to know perfetly his office /
he may find me^ to show to him books that truly and perfetly shall inform
him to do his office to the plesaunce of god. But this can not he learn of
byshoppys for they inform him after Antichrists law and ordenaunce for his
laws now reignen. Bishops will notte ache against their God their belly.
Yet against the^ that sayn the gospel in english would make men to err /
wore they well / that we find in latin la^gage more he retykes then of all
other langages / for the decre. says.xxiiij. xciij. Quidam autem heretici /
that there be founden syxty laten heretykes. And if me^ should hate any la^gage
for heresy the^ must they hate late^ But good forbede yt any la^gage should be
hated for heresy sythe^ many heretykes were of ye disciples of ye Appostles.
For saint Ihon^ says they have gon^ out of us but they were not of us. And
Paul says it behovythe heresys to be / How Antichrist is cause of al
heresies.
and a^tichrist makythe many mo heretykes then there should be for he stoppythe
so the knowing of gods law / and punysheth so them that he knowyth that have
it / that they dare not comen thereof openly to have true informacion / and
this makyth lay men yt desyre^ and love^ to know gods law to goo to gy^^^^
in pryvyte / and conceyven by their own w^^^^^ many times heresys the which
heresies in (...) time should be destroyed / if men might have free comenyng
openly / and but if this may be hade much of ye people shall dye in heresy /
for it lyethe (...) in Antichrists power to destroy all english books /
for as fast as he brennethe / other men shall draw / and thus the cause of
heresy and of ye people that dyethe in heresy is the frowardnes of bishops
that will not suffer men to have opyn comounyng and fre in the law of good and
therefore they be cowntable of as many sowlys as dyen in this default / and are
traitors to good in stoppyng of his law the which was made in salvation of ye
people. Is not this turninge the rotys of ye tres upward?
And now they turn his law byther cruel constitucyons into dampnacion of
the people as it shall be provyd upon them at the day of dome for gods law
says / Stabu^t iusti in magna constancia aduersus eos qui se angustianeru^t /
et qui abstulerunt labores eorum. etc. For that yt other men labore^ they
brenne^ / Read Sapien vi. and vij.
and if owre clergy would study well this lessen of sapie^ce to yt e^de / they
should mow read therein their oune dampnacion / but if they amend this defaulte
with other defaultes. Says not the holy man Ardemakan in the book of
questions that ye wurshupfull sacrament of the alter may be made in each come^
langage: For he says so diden the appostles. But we covett not this / but
that Antechrist give us leave to have the law of ower believe in english. Also
they that have comonyd much with ye Jews / say that they have in every land
that they be borne in / the bible in there mother tongue / that is Ebrewe. And
they be more practyse therein than annye men / ye (...) the lewd men as the
prestes. But it is read in there synagoges among the people of there prestes
to fulfill there prestes office and to the edification of the poraile / that for
worldly business and slew the may not study it. Also the.iiij. evangelistes
wrote the gospel in diverse langages / as Mathewe in Iurye / Mark in Italy /
Luke in Achaie / and Ihon^ in Asie. And all these wrotte in ye langages of the
same contr^ys / also Thobye says Chap. xiij. that good disperged / spread / or
scaterid yt Jews abroad among the hethen people that they telling unto they
in the merveylles of godde: they should knew that there were none other good /
but good of Israel. And good ordyned his people to beleve his law written
among them in there mothertounge / vt pater. Ge. xvij. and Exo. xiij. In so
much the book of Iudithe is written in Calde speech / vt peter per Hieronimu^
in prologo eiusde^. Also the books of Daniel / and of Esdre ben written in
Calde / vt pater per Hieroni. in prologis eorunde^ / also the book of Iohelis
in Arabyke and Sire speech / vt pater per Hieroni. in prologo eiusde^. Also
Ezechiest the prophet prophesyed in Babylon / and left his prophesye under the
mother tongue of Babylon / vt pater per Hieronimu^ in prologo eiusdem Also the
prophesye of Isaie is translated into the tongue of Ethiope / as Hierom^.
co^cludyth in primo prologo Gene. Then sythen the dark prophesyes were
translated among the hethen people that they might have knowledge of good and
of the incarnacion of Christ / much more it owght to be tra^slatyd to english
people that have receivyd the faith and bounden them self to keep it upon
pain of dampnacion / Mat. xxviij.
sythen Christ comm^unded his Apostles to preach his gospel (...) all the
world and exceptid no people nor lanage. Also Origin translated the bible out
of Ebrewe into Greek with help of other in the year of owre lord
God.CCxxxiiij. Also Aquila translated it in ye time of Adria^ ye emperowre in
the year of our lord.C. xxiiij. / also Theodosio^ tra^sla it in ye time of
the^perowre Contede.luij. year after Aquila / also Simacus translated it in ye
time of the^perowre Serene.xxx. year after Theodosion.viij. year after Simacus
it was translated the auctor unknown in the time of Alexander the emperowre /
And Jerome translated it into latin / vt in cronicis Cistercienc. li. ij. ca.
xxxij. And after that Ierom hade translated it into laten / he translated much
to women of the bible. And to the maidens Eustochia and Paula / he translated
the books of Iosue of Iudicum and Ruth / and Hester / and Ecclesiastes /
Jeremy / Isaie and Daniell / and the.xij. prophets / and the.vij. canonyke
epystylles vt pater in prologo coru^dem. And so all me^ may se here by Iero^
that it was never his intent to bind the law of god under his translacion of
laten but by his own deed gevythe leave to translate it into every speech for
Ierom wrytythe i^ his.lxxviij epistle to this man Atleta / that he should
inform his daughter in the books of the old law and the new / Also in
his.lxxv. epistle he wrytythe to ye virgyn Semetriadis / that she should for to
increase her self in virtue read now apo^ one book / and now / upon
another. And he specifiethe unto her that she also read the gospel / and the
epistylles of the Apostles. And thus Thenglyshe men desire to have the law of
good in english / But my lords say yt (...) makes me heretics and
peruerteth souls.
sythen it ^s called the law undefiled co^uertyng sowlys in to clennes / lex
dn^i immaculata conuertens ai^as / but Antechrist says that it is corrupt
with litterall lettre that it sleyth sowlys taking his auctorite of Paul /
that says / litera occidit spiritus audem viuificat. That is ye Lettre of the
ceremonies of the old law sleyth the Jews / and them that now vsen them /
but the spirit of the new law quykenethe true Christian men / sythen Christ
says my words ben spritte and lyffe. Also we take ensample of holy virgyns
to love to read the gospel as they dide^ / as Ratheryn / Cecyle / Lucye Agnes
/ Margaret / which alegyd the holy gospel to the infidels / that slew them
for the keeping thereof. Of these foresaid auctorites it is provyd laufull / yt
both men and women laufully may read and write gedes law in their mother
tunge / and they that forfenden this they show them selfs heyers and sons
of the first tormentors / and werse / for they shown them selfs the veraye
disciples of Antichrist / which has and shall pass all the malice of
tyrauntes that have been before in stoppyng and pervertynge of gods law which
dead engendrythe great vengeance to fall in this realm / but if it be
amendid For Paul says Roma. 1. The wrath of good is showed from hevyn upon
cruelnes and vnryghtfulnes of these men that with holden the trowthe of good in
unright wysnes / Reuelatur enim ira dei super omne^ impictarem et iniusticiam
hominum eoru^ qui veritatem dei in iniustitia detinent. Now good of his mercy
geve unto ower king / and to ower lords grace of true understanding to amend
this default principally and all other / then shall we (...) we easily to be
amendid. For until it be amend^^ there shall never be rest and peace in this
realm Who yt fyndythe or redythe this lettre put it furthe in examinacio^ and
suffer it not to be hid or destroyed / but multyplyed for no man knows what
proffyt may come thereof. For he that compilede it / purpo^yth with gods
help to maintain i unto the death / if neade be. And therefore all christen
me^ and women / pray that the word of god may be unbound / and delyvered
from the power of Antichrist / and run among his people.

Amen.
