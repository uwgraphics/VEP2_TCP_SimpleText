Here begins a little book, that speaks of Purgatory: and what Purgatory
is and in what place / and of the pains that be therein / and which souls do
abide therein till they be pourged of sin / and which abide not there. And
for what sins a soul goth to hell / and of the help that souls i^
purgatory may have of their friends that be on five: and what pardon aueyfeth
to man's soul.

The Prologue.
MAny men speak / as they in the book read
Of the pains of purgatory / but few it dread
For many a man wotteth not / what thing it is
Therefore they dread it / the less ywys
And for some men / have thereof no knowing
Of the place of purgatory / not understanding
Therefore I will tell / what it is in lykenes
And in what place / as the book is wytnes
And which souls goth thither / and for what syn
And what manner of pains / ben therein
And also what thing / is most in certain
That might a man's soul / bring out of pain.
First here it tells what is Purgatory.
Purgatory is / nothing else to tell
But a clensynge place / souls in to dwell
That have done syn^e / and have co^trycyon
And ben in the way / of salvation
And there they should suffer / both sorrow and woe
Till all their sins / ben away ydo
And cleansed of all sins / that ever they wrought
Both in word and will / in deed and eke in thought
For so pured gold / never none there was
As the souls shall ben / or they thens pass
wherefore the pain / that the soul there shall hent
Is more bitter / than all the tourment
That all martyrs suffered / both young and old
Sith that god was borne / and to the Jews sold
For the least pain / of the pains there
Is more bitter / than the most pain that is here
As witnesses a great clerk / and says shortly
In a book / that speaks of Purgatory.
Minima pena Purgatorii mayor est maxima pena mundi. He says the least pain /
is well more
In Purgatory / that greueth sore
Than the most pain / that may be
In all this world / to feel or se
For the pain there / is more ferse and fell
Than heart may think / or tongue may tell
Between the pain of hell / certainly
And between the pain / of Purgatory
Is no dyfference / but certes that one
Shall have an end / and that other none
For the pains of hell / should never cease
Ne the souls therein / have never release
But in purgatory / the souls dwells still
Till they ben clensyd / of all manner ill
And as much ben there.xl. days told
As here.xl. year / be a man never so old
So that a pain there / one day to se
Is as much / as a year told here may be
But every day of penance / that is done here
Shall stand there instead / of an hole year
As Christ says openly / and witnesses well
By his holy prophet / Ezechiell.
Diem pro anno deditibi. That is so much / to understand now
For an hole year / I gave one day to you
Than serves that pain / as the book tells
To cleanse the souls / that therein dwells
But penance here done / with good will
Serves for two things / gods law to fulfill
One cause is / to cleanse the souls well
Of all deedly sins / and eke venyell
Another is to have / in heaven more mede
To these two things / penance may us led
For every penance that a man does here
Shall have a special joy / in heaven clear
That ever without end / shall than last
If they done penance / with heart steadfast.
In what place Purgatory is.
THe place there / that purgatory is hold
Is under earth / as clerks men told
Above the same place / as clerks men tells
There that deed children / vnchrystened dwells
That from the fair sight / of gods face
Ben put for ever / without any grace
And that place / is even above hell pyt
Between purgatory / and hell is it
And so is the place / of purgatory set
Above them both / thither souls be fette
That must needs / their pain there have
And after that pain / Ihesus will them save
Yet above that stead / is that fair place
That god after his death / vysyted through his grace
And all that were there / with him he took
And left none therein / as tells the book
Nor from that time / as clerks can tell
Come never no soul / there for to dwell
Ne never none hereafter / therein shall fall
For that place is Lymbo / as clerks it call
That is a fair prison / as tells the book
where our forne fathers / were in yloke
And of all these four / men may one hell make
And eueryche of them / for hell may be take
And therefore holy church / that for souls prayth
Calls purgatory hell / and thus thereof says.
Domine Ihesu christ / libera animas omnium fidelium defunctorum de manu
inferni / et de profundis aquaram. etc. Lord Ihesu christ / deliver out of
hell hand
All christen souls / that been there under bond
That is from that place / in to heaven bliss
For much pyne / have souls there ywysse
But from the lowest hell / without any doubt
May no soul thens / be delivered out
Of mercy to have / is no hope ne trust
As holy Job tells / that the soth wyste.
Quia in inferno / nulla est redemptio. He says that in hell / that is so
far adowne
Is never delyueraunce / for no raunsowne
And therefore masses and prayers / helps them naught
To the same souls / that thither be brought
For mass ne prayer / abateth not their pyne
As witnesses the holy man / saint Austyne.
Si sarem patrem aut matrem in inferno / non pro eis orarem. He says / if my
father and my mother were
In the pytte of hell / and I wist them there
I would never / by day ne by night
Pray for them to god / that is full of might
But purgatory so long / last not may
For it lasts no longer / than till domes day
For after domes day / as clerks can se
The place of purgatory / shall no where be
Than shall hell be full of fendes within
That evermore shall last / to avenge sin
But some men have wonder / and asks why
That purgatory is ordained / with mercy
And hell without mercy / that is so low
The cause why / men must well know
For the same sin / that in earth is wrought
From the earth upward / ne passes naught
Than needs punysshed / must be that sin
Here upon earth / or else within
That is here in earth / there that we dwell
Other else in purgatory / or else in hell
For the soul sin / is so heavy and hard
That it draws the soul / ever downewarde
And till the sin / with penance be away nome
Erst may the soul / never to heaven come.
Of two Purgatoryes / that god has ordained.
YEt tells these clerks / more openly
That two purgatoryes / there be namely
One is common / for to tell
That is within earth / above hell
And the other / is specially through grace
That is here in earth / in diverse place
For some ben not / in common stead pyght
But they ben punysshed here / by day or night
In many diverse stedes / within in their ghost
There that they / have sin done most
But that pyne / may be brought out of dread
Through prayer of friends / and alms deed
To the which / they may ghostly appear
Through great grace / in diverse stead here
That pain as I erst told / wonder sore greueth
But it is a warning / to them that here lives
And thus may men here / truly se
where that purgatory / needs must be.
Of the pains that been in Purgatory.
IN purgatory / as the book witness beryth
Ben diverse pains / that the soul deryth
Many mo certes / than I can neuen
But I find thereof / written seven
That may be called / pains full well
And to you of them / I will tell somedell.
The first pain / of the seven ywys
As men may know / that redeth this
Is the great dread / that the soul is in
when the body and it / departs atwyn
For the soul seyth / than about it stand
Many foul deuylles / to do it shonde
And that sight is a pain / wonder grievous
For the deuylles ben / so foul and hydeous
So that so hardy man / was never none
Here in earth living / in flesh and in bone
But if a man saw / that sight that he shall se
Anon for dread / wood should he be
A great pain it is than / to se such a sight
But more is to the soul / that therewith shall fight.
The second pain / is next than afterward
Is great dread of death / that is wonder hard
That the soul shall have / with much care
Till the dome be given / how it shall fare
For many aungelles / should all ready be there
And many deuylles / with horrible chere
Than shall the soul / between them stand
And aungelles shall be / in her right hand
And the deuylles shall be / in her left side
So that the soul / needs must there abide
Till that her contakes / ben brought to end
For erst he wot not / whyther to wend
whyther that god / will dampne it or save
Than shall the soul / so great dread have
Right as a man / that is amyddes the se
In great peril / and wot not whyther to fle
when tempests falls / and storm smarte
Than may he thens / never starte
And as a man has here / bodily dread
when he is enpeched / of any peryllous deed
Before the kings justice / and of the country
That been charged / if he gylty be
Than wot he not / if he shall be spylte
Other ben delivered / and the law fulfylte
In great peril of life / may that man be
Yet has the soul mor dread / than has such three
For if it have the dome / of dampnacyon here
Than goth it to hell / and the deuylles fere
And if the soul be dampened / in to that place
Than is no manner hope / of mercy and grace
what wonder is than / though the soul have dread
That to god after / mercy dare not ones grede.
The third pain / is an exyle
when that the souls / here some while
Ben exyled from life / and to death brought
For the coming again / they know naught
Therefore they should have / much mourning
when they be dampened / from their liking
And the mourning that they have / without lysse
Shall than be to them / great anguysshe.
And the fourth pain / is diverse syckenes
That souls have / in much dystres
For diverse euylles / they shall have therein
For diverse deeds / that they did in sin
And some for pride / that they used often
Shall have the cold fever / that is not soft
For that shall grieve the soul / more bytterly
Than ever any fever / did the body
And some shall have there / for couetyse
Strong dropsye / that they shall not arise
And some shall have / in all their ly^es about
For sloth in their life / the podagre and gout
And byles and felones / and postumes also
That in man's body / does much woe
And some for wrath / shall have the palsye
That to the soul / shall sore derye
And some for glotony / shall have evermore
The hard quynsy / that shall grieve them sore
And some for lechery / shall have also
A foul mesylry / go whyther they go
Thus shall the soul / that god will save
For diverse sins / diverse pains shall have
That in earth here / had very repentance
And had not in earth / done their penance
Now think we / what pain the body suffers here
Through diverse euylles / that greuyth every where
Though that it last / but a little stounde
Yet it brings a man / full soon to the ground
And as the maladye / greuyth the body sore
Yet it greuyth for the time / the soul well more
So that the soul / has there more penance
Than has the body / for any manner greuaunce
But now a man / may speak there again
And axe how the soul / may feel pain
That after death is so sottel / as in book we read
That it may occupye / no manner stead
And to this questyon / I may answer well
As I have clerks / herd thereof tell
The soul of the body / the life is
Of every man / both more and less
And without life / is nothing living
For in no deed thing / may be any feeling
Than is all the feeling / of the life holy
All in the soul / and naught in the body
For when a man's soul / is passed away
Than is the body / but ^oule earth and claye
And that is than / as deed as any stone
That no thing feleth / but him self one
Yet may some men ask / more thereto
Now may the soul / that is in woe
Be pyned / with such maladye without
That is in diverse lymmes / of the body about
Sith it has / neither body ne head
Ne none other lymme / thereon byleued
To this / I may answer shortly
That the soul / though it have no body
It shall have pain / as in lymmes there
with which it did / most sin here
For each to other than / shall seem ywys
As though it had the shape / as a man is
And in this manner / shall a soul another se
But certes none of them / may feled be
No More than may / a man's breath here
when it passes from him / in no manner
Ensample of Lazar / and a rich man
That cordeth to this matter / as I proud can
The rich man warned / the lazar mete
That in Abraham's bosom / had his sete
But the rich man / was buried in hell
And saw lazar / in heaven dwell
He cried to Abraham / and bad fair withal
That a drope of water / might down fall
Upon his tongue / from lazarus fyngers end
For he might not / out of that pain wend
By the rich man / that spoke so to that other
Had no lymme / ne tongue another
Ne lazar / as ye may well understand
Had another finger / ne hand
For they were / spyrytes both only
That had another lymme / ne body
But the rich man's soul / feled pyne in hell
As though it had been a body / in flesh and fell
And lazarus soul / seemed to him than
As though he had been / a lives man
But I have herd / some clerks maintain
Such manner opynyons / as I wene
That a soul / that is in purgatory
Other in hell / has of the air a body
To suffer pain / in his lymmes there
After that he has / in earth sinned here
But whyther a soul have / a body or none
It shall have pain / as the body has done.
And the fyfth pain / though it be somewhat late
Is hot brennynge fire / that northynge may bate
But alms deed / masses and prayere
That of friends / for them ben done here
To abate that fire / tho three ben best
For they bring soon / man's soul to rest
But that fire / is hotter and more kene
Than any fire of this world / that may be seen
For all the water / that a man may on thenche
One sparcle of that fire / might not quench
For one sparcle of that fire / is more brennynge
Than all the fire / in this world lyghtnynge
And the soul is also / more tender and nesshe
Than a man's body / with blood and flesh
Than the soul / that is so tender of kind
Must needs their penance / more harder find
Than any manner body / that ever alive was
Though it should there through / make his pas
But no soul may / from thens wend
Till all their penance / be brought to end
And that fire / werketh not through kind a right
In the same soul / that to penance is dyght
As does the fire / that in earth brenneth here
But evermore it werketh / in another manner
As god has ordained / for why it is so
As it were an instrument / that longs thereto
Through the which / the soul cleansed may be
In the pain of purgatory / or that it god se
For why all manner fire / that is therein
It is a manner fire / for to waste sin
For as the fire in the world / may all thing brenne
And make metal melt / and abroad run
And right so the fire / there through long heat
wastes there / both small sins and great
There be now fyres / some more some less
But all one manner fire / that never shall cesse
For as the son / may over all thing pass
That men greuyth / some more and some less
Right so ye same fire / that in purgatory is brought
Some souls it pyneth sore / and some naught
For all souls / must needs dwell therein
After that their charge / is there of sin
But some souls / should delivered be thens soon
That here in earth / have their penance done
But some soul shall abide there / many a year
That little penance has done / with his body here
And has lived long / in his sin also
And therefore / saint Austyn says thus thereto.
Necesse est vt tantus sit dolor: pro peccatis quantus fuerit amor / tanto
divtius anima torquetur in penis: qua^to affec^ tus mundanis inherebat
desiderus. etc. Saint Austyn says / that needful it is
That as much sorrow / he have here and no les
For every sin / and eke trespass
As lust and liking / in the sin was
And he says also / as before as rad
That the more liking / that a man in sin had
And ever gives thereto / his lust and will
His flesshely liking / all to fulfill
The longer must needs / the soul in pain be
In purgatory / that he may not fle
And or the soul may se god / in his face
As three things / they must brenne in that place
That is to say / as wood and hay also
And stoble / that will away with the fire go
For the most venyall sins / should brenne long
As a tree that is great / and has rotes strong
But the small sins / soon shall brenne away
As does stoble in earth / when fire comes there nigh
But the mean sins / brenneth not so soon
For they brenne slowly / and have more to done
Right as does the hay / that with fire is tend
That long lies and smoketh / or it be through brende
Thus should they ben brende / and wasten sore
For their venyall sins / both less and more
And for deedly sin / that they ben of shryue
And the trespass thereof / god has forgive
And penance therefore / naught have done here
They shall there be brende / in the same manner
And when they be fined / and made bright
Than shall they come / before gods sight
In to merry Paradyse / that is a joyful place
That is evermore full / of mercy and grace.
And the fyxte pain / is for to tell
For the souls vnclensed / should there dwell
Still in purgatory / and be bound fast
with bonds of sin / to make them aghast
And as many souls / as be in that prysone
For no gift they may / ne for no ransom
From that hard pain / them self win
Till that fire have brent / their bonds of sin
And thus they ben bound / both hands and fete
In hot brennynge fire / that is wonder great
Certes than me thinks / no pain may be more
Than the souls suffers / that greuyth them sore
For nothing thens / may them borowe
Another abrydge any thing / of their much sorrow
Another to help them / thens to be brought
For their own prayer / ne helps them naught
But if in earth / they any good did
As masses done / song and alms deed
Of their friends in earth / ye to god for them besought
That made this world / and all thing of naught
Full hard ben the pains / ye the souls suffer there
If hope of mercy / soon after ne were
But some time they should / so much pain have
That they take no keep / that god will them save
Therefore we should think / that in earth ben here
what pain the soul suffers / that is there
Among soul fendes / that there have leave
Some time the souls / to tourment and grieve
As long as they have / any spotte of sin
For erst from that place / may no man them win
Till they ben cleansed / and made all clean
Of all manner sins / that none be seen
And when they ben deyuered / of all manner sin
No more pain / shall they feel therein
But soon than after / they shall even wend
To the bliss of heaven / that has none end.
And the seventh pain / is in likeness
There that the souls ben / as in wilderness
There that defaulte is / of all good thing
That a man might have / of his liking
For their pain to them / is many foide
For now they ben in great hete / and now in cold
And that pain to them / is full long
As now in great hete / and after cold strong
And there should suffer / both hungre and threst
And many great that pains / without any rest
And sore ben bette / to make more their pain
with great storms of hayle / and of rain
And that betynge / is both sharp and kene
But such storms / never erst were seen
As the souls there / should feel and se
And with diverse tourmentes / tourmented be
For some many a year / shall abide there for sin
Till they the sight of god / cleanly may win
And such manner pains / they shall have evermore
with many other tourmentes / ye shall grieve them sore
But among all other / a great pain that shall be
The much coueytyse / that they have to se
The sweet face of god / that is ever so bright
And the long taryenge / of tht fair sight
But to that same sight / may they never come
Till all their sins / from them be nome
And here I have told / somedell to you
Of the pains of purgatory / that be hard ynowe.
Of the souls that wendeth in to purgatory / and abides there till they ben
pourged of sin / and which souls abide not there.
THe souls that / to purgatory should wend
when that death / of them has made an end
Needs they must / in purgatory dwell
And suffer pains / that been smart and fell
For eueryche syn^e: there shall be punysshed after kind
Through bitter pains / that there they should find
After that their deeds / ben more or less
And their penance have done / or they hens pass
But all souls / abides not in that place
For some after their death / anon have grace
And sykerly / should wend to bliss
As holy Innocents / that never did mysse
And other souls / of good men and parfyte
That never in erthly thing / had any delight
But only on god / that them dear bought
And here in earth / great penance wrought
But some men that death / suddenly does take
And in deedly sin / their end make
Even in to hell / they should wend
And there dwell in pain / ever without end
And that is no wonder / me thinks in my mind
For each deedly sin / so heavy is of kind
That it may than / within a little stounde
Bring a man's soul / in to hell ground
But a soul that is / of deedly sin shryue
And his trespase in earth / is clenely forgive
And also the penance / that is him enjoined
Ben not done here / at days appointed
wherefore the soul / is not cleansed clean
Of other small sins / that often comes between
Than these souls / should ben save
But yet in purgatory / them behooves to have
Hard pain and bitter / and there abide long
Till the souls have / their clensynge a fonge
As they first were / when they took flesh and bone
And the holy baptysme / at the font stone
Yet tells these clerks also / in this manner
That so clean out of sin / lives no man here
Another none so parfyte is / in christen law
Nor a child / that is from his mother draw
That after his death / to heaven wendeth on hye
Till he have passed / through that strayte way
And till he have seen there / the pains euerychone
But the young children / thereof shall feel none
For they could never / no manner sin werche
But went in the true way / of holy church
Therefore they should / through purgatory fle
As does the foul in the earth / as every man may se
without any pyne / that might them dear
And from all wyckednes / me shall them were
But uneath may any man / quyte there through go
That ne shall of purgatory / feel some woe
For that fire / will fond him to brenne
If it may on him / any venyall sin kenne
For ye should understand / as I tell can
That there is living / none so parfyte a man
That he some time / ne thinks an ydell thought
And lightly lets it pass / and charge it naught
Of the which / he shall clenled be
Or that he may / the face of god se
For as gold / that shyneth clear and bright
Seems well pured / unto a man's sight
And if it were put / in to the fire eft soon
It should be the clerer / by him self alone
Right so the souls / in the same manner
Of the parfyte men / that seems most clear
Of all sins / and makes them to god yare
Yet they shall in purgatory / somedell feel of care
For all they must needs / there through pass
Both young and old / more and less
For that same fire / that is there within
Shall find on them / some spotte of sin
As light thought / the which ben in vain
And for them / they should there suffer pain
For so pure gold fined / never in earth was
As they ben through that fire / or they thens pass.
For which sins, a soul goth to hell.
MAny manner sins / ye the souls greuyth
Reygneth among men / ye in earth lives
And some ben deedly / i^ thought and in deed
And some ben venyall / as I in book read
But sins that men / deedly does call
Should not in purgatory / be cleansed all
But tho ben punysshed / evermore in hell
And which these ben / I will you tell
These ben the heavy sins / that I will descrye
First pride than wrath / and afterward envy
Glotonye and slouthe / in gods service
The foul sin of lechery / and eke coueytyce
Manslaughter also / and false oaths swerynge
And sacrylege also / and false witness berynge
Robbrye and to poor men / to done rauayne
These ben the sins / that brings men to pain
For eueryche of all these / is a deedly sin
And lets man's soul / heaven to win
And hatred also / is deedly sin among
If it be hold / in man's heart long
And dronkennes / is deedly sin also
If a man use it / and often will it do
And therefore every man / that gylty be of this
And think his soul / to bring to blys
But he him amend / or he hens wend
He shall not though he would / after his lives end
And in to purgatory / shall he never come
But without end / in to hell be nome
And if he be repentaunt / and shryfe
Of all such sin / here by his life
Fro hell pyne / than he may him save
But penance in his body / yet must he have
Than must the soul gone / after as I wene
In to purgatory / till of sins it be clean
For penance done for sin / as I told ere
Needs must be fulfilled / here or there.
And when thou at hole in body / and thy might last
And often thou etest / when thou should fast
And when the list sleep / and wylt not arise
And ever co^mest to late / to gods service
And make for thy sins no manner sorowynge
when thou art in good state / and in liking
Or when thou prayest / and make thine orayson
And have in thy prayer / but little devotion
Or when thou have liking / through lust and life
In thy bed flesshely / to meddle with thy wife
Only thy liking / more there to fulfill
Than to begette a child / through gods will
And also when thou / vysytest men to late
That have great syckenes / and ben in feeble state
Or men that lies here / in strong prison
Or have in their bodies / any trybulacyon
Or men that been / sinful and sorry
For their friends souls / that been in purgatory
Them to vysyte / it were great mede
Through good prayers / and alms deed
And also if thou do not / after thine estate
To make them friends / that been in debate
And if thou speak to any man / but if thou wit why
Bytterly with noise / and with loud cry
Or when thou praysest / any man more
For encheson of glosynge / than for his lore
Or when in church / make any iangelynge
Or thy way is / in any idle thing
Be it out of church / or else within
It is accounted / for a venyall sin
And also when thou art / over lightly wroth
And swerest / and might not hold thine oath
Or when thou cursest / any manner man
And haste no cause / him for to ban
Or when thou supposest / any wickedness
Through evil suspycyon / or evil trowenesse
These ben things / as saint Austyn tells
That makes in purgatory / ye many soul dwells
That haueth there / much sorrow and woe
And there ben yet / of other wickedness many mo
And of venyall sins / full many a score
without them that I / have told before
But so wytty / is none erthely man
That all venyall sins / tell can
For often times / in the day men falls
In to sins / that men venyall calls
And every he sin / is worthy a pain
That is done in deed / or in word in vain
That must clenely / be fordone
Here or in purgatory / euerychone
Therefore I counceyll / each man that be wise
To haunt this lore / that is of pryse
That fordoth / through holy man's lore
All venyall sins / both less and more
And if any man fall / in deedly sin
Let him arise / and lie not therein
And take a priest / and do him to shryue
And do his penance / by his life
And evermore / have in his thought
Sorrow for sins / that he has wrought
And do his penance / with all his might
And pray to god / both day and night
And go woolwarde / and fast and wake
And suffer disease / for our lords sake
For no man may / in to heaven go
But if he suffer here / both sorrow and woe
And when god greuyth a man / in any wise
Than should he suffer it / without fayntyse
what syckenes that may / any man grieve
Or loss of catell / that god will him reave
Or unkindness / falshed other treason
Or any disease / that might be against reason
Than suffer it mekely / and think in thy thought
That without encheson / ne comes it naught
But god wottes all / and why it is
Perchance for things / that he has done amys
To chastyce him / in such manner
For sins that he / has done here
Or it may be / him to preue
To the love of god / the more him to meue
For often time that thing / that god will save
Anger and disease / he must have
Other for his sins / is that sonde
Than should he thank / gods hand
And take mekely / that god him sends
And fle all evil thing / that he defends
For through dyseases / and angres here
He makes a man / as a prysonere
Penance to suffer / for his folly
That he has done / through the deuylles trecherye
For if he suffer it / without grutchynge
It stands him instead / of penance alowynge
And afterward / god will more to him do
Give him great mede / and grace also
And full bliss in heaven / have therefore
If he take it mekely / though it grieve him sore
As a good child / suffers mekely and still
when his father chastyseth him / after his will
And done all goodness / and let all quede
And so should each man / suffer god and dread
And namely / alms deed often to make
Cloth the naked / and to the hungrye mete take
And other works of mercy / often to werche
As techeth us / good men of holy church
And led clean life / in to his lives end
And after his death / his soul shall wend
To bliss / and all pains lightly pass
That been in purgatory / both more and less
And now / I have told to you all
The sins that saint Austyn / venyall does call
And now will I tell / what helps in certain
The souls that in purgatory / haueth pain.
Of the help that souls has that been in purgatory, of good friends that been
left behind them living in earth.
THe souls that / to purgatory wendes
Be brought thens / through help of fre^des
That done alms deed / for them well afyne
And so says the holy man / saint Austyne.
Non est negandum quod spiritus defunctorum pietate amicorum suorum viuentium
possint refeuari ab omnibus penis. etc. He says it is not to gain say / in
no manner
That the souls of them / that deed ben here
From pain might soon / unbound be
Through friends in earth / that had of them pity
Four manner of helps general / me may call
That in purgatory avails to the souls all
That is bidding of Pater noster / and eke fasting
And alms deeds / and masses singing
And in two manners / as clerks can se
The soul from purgatory / delivered may be
One is / through grace and meekness
And another / through way of ryghtfulnesse
By way of grace / in two manner
As it is written / in this book here
First prayer to christ / that is our heed
when he is offered / in form of breed
In the priests hands / with good intent
when the bread is turned / in to the sacrament
As through prayer / of gods servants here
That ever ben busye / in their prayere
Than may the soul / that in purgatory is
Through way of grace / specially have this
Delyueraunce of pain / that there sore greuyth
Through masses and prayers / that there releuyth
And by way of ryghtfulnesse / it is help also
By two ways / that I can show thereto
First through alms deed / that me gives the poor
It is brought of pain / that greuyth it sore
Another is / of their penance abrydgynge
Through penance of friends / and of fasting
Thus may the soul / as the book is witness
Be help / through way of ryghtfulnesse
That is to say / that they may in that need
Be brought from pain / through alms deed
And through penance / and through pardon
Till there ben paid / a certain raunsom
Than may the soul / be delivered away
Through friends that will / their ransom pay
And thus may the souls / that hens wendes
To purgatory be help / through their friends
But some may help / and some may naught
The souls / that in to purgatory be brought
But through such friends / they may help be
That lives here in earth / in parfyte charity
For the help of them / that charity fails
To the souls in purgatory / no thing avails
For they ben all / as lymmes of one body
That been in earth here / and tho in purgatory
And as we may se / proprely here
One body have / many lymmes sere
And each of them / both less and more
May another help / if it grieve them sore
But if one of the lymmes / begins to fail
That lymme may to the other / little avail
Right so it fares / in the same wise
By him that lies in pain / and may not arise
As they that be in purgatory / in their penance
without help of friends / have none alegaunce
But who that in deedly sin / is brought
And charity / in his heart has naught
He ne is / but as deed in soul within
As long as he is / in that deedly syn
And his help ne is / but as in vain
To souls that dwells / in that pain
For that help stands / in no manner stead
Nor naught avails / that they have bid
And nevertheless / all though that he so be
In deedly sin / and out of charity
Yet may the soul / be help thus
If he to the poor man / give alms
That they for the soul / specially pray
That lies in purgatory / as I you say
Yet may the help / and the travail
Of a sinful man / to the soul avail
If it in bidding / done here be
Of a friend / that is in charity
That help may avail / the soul soon
For his sake / that byddeth it to be done
That in his heart / has charity knyt
And for his sake / would do it
For god will nothing do / for his sake
That will not charity / in his heart take
This case falls often / as I understand
Between a lord / and his servant bond
There that the lord / good and ryghtfull is
And his servant / is wicked ywys
And if his servant do / any manner thing
That is good / to the lords bidding
Yet it may avail / to some profit
Though he in goodness / have no delight
And that is through reason / and goodness ywys
Of him through whom / that prayer is
For though it be / against the doers will
Yet as against the bydder / it stands still
But if in charity / they were both
The more were the help / to the death for sothe
And also though a priest / in any manner time be
Sinful / and out of charity
Yet he is gods mynyster / and holy churches
That the sacrament / upon the altar werches
That is naught / the less of might
All though / the priest live not aryght
For though a priest / that syngeth the mass
Be never so full / of wickedness
Yet that sacrament / that is so holy
May not be enpayred / through his folly
Than may a mass / from pain souls bring
Though a sinful priest / does it sing
For he syngeth the mass / in gods name
Under which order / he may do no shame
But preuy prayers made with good intent
That be said / besides the sacrament
Of a good priest / does more god pay
Than of a sinful priest / used each day
But the offrynge / of gods body so sweet
Brings many souls / from pains great
wherefore me thinks / that masses singing
May rathest a soul / from pain bring
That goth out of this world / in charity
And in purgatory / cleansed shall be
But to them / that be dampened for aye
No good deed / to them avail may
Another alms deed / prayer ne mass
For they ben / as the book bears witness
Departed fro christ / that of Mary was borne
And the souls of them / ever be forlorn
And as lymmes ben deed / and laid in claye
And all ben / from the body away
Than may nothing help / in no manner kind
The lymmes that been dried / as it were a rynde
Right so all the help / that a man can tell
Nothing avails / to them that be in hell
But yet help of friends / that be in gods service
May avail to the soul / in some manner wise
For such service may / to the good be wrought
So that in less pain / they shall be brought
For thereto avails / alms deeds and bedes
To the souls that been / in all three stedes
For it avails to the soul / that in purgatory is
To bring it rather thens / to blys
Also it avails them / that in heaven be set
For each day / their joy increases therefore the bette
And the mo that comes / in to that holy place
The more is their joy / before gods face
Also it avails them / that be in hell
For the fewer / should come there to dwell
And the fewer / that comes there for syn
The less pain they have / that been therein
And the mo / that in to that place does wend
The more is their pain / without end
Thus may help of friends / avail by reason
To the souls that been / in that strong prison
And namely to them / that be in hell
And to them also / that in purgatory does dwell
But such help / makes no souls fro pain wend
But charity be with them / at their end
For in hell / was never no charity
And in heaven / thereof no need may be
And as a man may / here with his hand
Make a sete for another / that is under bond
And is not of power / it to make
But another makes it / all for his sake
Right so may a man / for the deed body do
For of help / he has much need thereto
And the souls / that been to paradyse gone
Need of help / they have right none
But if any good deed / for them be wrought
It may to the needful / in help be brought
For all the help / that specially is done here
Avails to the souls / that in purgatory ere
And to some more / and to some less
After that they be told / of worthynesse
And after that charity / is in them clear ynowe
Of them that lives in earth / among you
That ever most be busye / well for to do
As well for him self / as for them in woe
For when a man / shall from this world flytte
Than can no man tell / by no manner of wit
whether that he shall than / in to purgatory wend
Other in to heaven bliss / that has none end
For some men seems good / and parfyte alone
That after their death day / be dampened full soon
For perchance / they ben full foul within
And passes of this world / in deedly syn
And some men seems here / that they live amysse
That soon ben saved / and wendeth to bliss
For perchance in earth / before their dyenge
They ben amended / of their myslyuynge
But of this may no man / in certain be
For it falls holy / to gods ^ryuyte
And nevertheless / we should here believe aye
That all tho that dye / go in good way
That we say in earth here / good works werche
And has all the sacraments / of holy church
And whether so they be / our friend or fo
All thing that is in us / we should do
And pray to almighty god / both loud and still
For all christen souls / as it is gods will
Yet men may ask / why me does masses sing
For young children / after their dyenge
That of masses ne prayer / has no manner need
For they did never / no manner sinful deed
To this I may answer / by good reason
That for reverence of god / is the encheson
That masses me does sing / and prayers make
That god both to young and old / his mercy take
And also for the custom / of holy church
And for them that been deed / some good to werche
Now ye have herd / as the book is witness
Now alms deed and prayers / penance and mass
That been done / through friends true and certain
May help the souls / that been in strong pain
And now I will tell to you / more thereto
what profit pardon / the soul may do
That is pourchased in earth / in a good manner
And also in clean life / while he lives here.
what pardon avails to man's soul.
PArdon helps them / by many ways
That have purchased it / ^ their life days
For pardon of popes / and of bysshoppes his
That in earth is granted / or a man dye
May avail to the soul / that in purgatory is
If it be purchased / worthily ywys
And if they have for their sins / contrycyon
And ben shryuen / before that same pardon
Tha^ may pardon after their death / through gods so^de
In purgatory to them / great profit ^^nde
For pardon that is / right full and certain
May a man release / both of debt and pain
As far as the pardon / may it areche
For thus have I learned / through clerk speech
Pardon is nothing else / to us in likeness
But of pain that is debt / forgyuenesse
Pardon may no man have / but he well werche
For it is a treasoure / of holy church
That gadred is / for mede of pardon
Through virtue / of Christ's holy passion
And of the worthynesse / and of the deeds
Of holy saints / and of their medes
And it is gadred / of mykell good
First through martyrdom / and shedynge of blood
Of holy Martyrs / that much loved Christ's lay
For whose love they were brought / in to great afraye
And in penance / and travail of confessors
And through good techynge / of wise doctors
And of chastyte / of good vyrgynes and clean
That to god ever / would their moan mean
And also / of all holy church works
And of prayers / of holy priests and clerks
And of all this / that I have now before told
Is gadred this treasoure / both new and old
And of that treasoure / the Pope bears the kaye
That opens and closes / and sins does away
For that falls to him / of office to hold
For he is vycar in earth / god him make would
The kayes be nothing else / to understand
But full power / given to him through gods sonde
Through which power / he may the law fulfill
Bind and unbind / after his will
For the same power / him falls to have
That god gave to Peter / souls to save
For god gave to Peter / in earth full power
And said to him / in this manner.
Quodcu^que ligaueris super terram / erit ligatum et in celis: et quodcu^que
solucris super terram / erit solutum et in celis. All that thou byndest / in
earth says he
Shall ever in heaven / bound be
And all that thou vnbyndest / in earth right
Shall be unbound / in heaven bright
This power to all popes / gave our lord
After saint Peter / to hold that word
As tells thereof / in an exposycyon
Of the Gospel / in a lesson
Than seems it well / by this reason
That each pope has / a great iurysdyccyon
To assoyle a man / and him forgive
All dettes of pain / that he should be to drive
But yet must a man yield / forsothe also
All that he has wrongefully / take or do
For the pope / when he grants that grace
He byndeth holy church / in that same place
For him / to whom that grace avails
To fulfill all things / that him fails
But the bysshoppes / that been of less state
Have less power / as clerks knows that
For their dygnyte / is much less
Therefore they / may not their power pass
And though it be / not so suffysaunt
As is the popes / yet they may make a grant
Of their power of pardon / a great party
To their underlings / both low and hye
But yet it must / as I before have said
Be given through holy churches treasour: by god read
And nevertheless / there may no man pardon win
But he ben out / of deedly sin
For he that has / the keeping of that treasoure
That to man's soul / is so precious a flower
May not give it / to holy churches foose
Lest he get him thereby / an evil loose
For such men they ben / and none other ywys
That dwell in deedly sin / and ever does amys
For they ben out / of holy church law
Therefore they may / no pardon to them draw
But friends of holy church / may well crave
After pardon / for they should it have
For they be such / that ever be fre
Of deedly sin / and in parfyte charity
To them such pardon / shall neuermore fail
But in purgatory / to them shall avail
To bring out of pain / their souls clean
As ferforth / as the pardon may mean
As clerks tells / that god will set
For the remenaunt of pains / that been of debt
That perchance is left / and not done here
As it may fall / in diverse manner
A party of penance / that is enioynt
And is not done here / before dethes point
And in party / of venyall sins wrought
And in party of sins / that been out of thought
And in party / for little repentance
And in party / for over little penance
And in party / of penance enioynt and not do
And perchance / with little devotion also
And all these may be called / the remenaunt
Of debt of pain / that is not suffysaunt
That should be fulfilled / in earth here
Other in purgatory / to make the souls more clear
But such debt / may soon there be quyte
who that to such pardon / has any delight
In forgyuenesse of all penance / ye may be thought
whether it be enjoined here / or be naught
For so much pardon / may a man pourchace
Here in his life / that he may have grace
In purgatory to be quyte / of all manner debt
That from the bliss / might him let
For so large / is holy churches treasoure
That it may bring souls / from all doloure
And from all pains of debt / that may be
Of all men that been / in chrystente
And thus pardon / i purgatory to souls may avail
But some clerks / gives us counceyle
That we should keep it / and holy spare
Till we to purgatory / come all yare
And in earth do penance / while we may
For a man in purgatory / shall think one day
Longer than him thought / ever in earth here
The space and time / of an hole year
Than is one day of pardon / in forgyuenesse
More worth / than all this worlds richesse
For the soul had lever / that such pain shall drive
One day of pardon / than any thing on live
For all this wide world / and it were his
He would give to have rest there / one day ywys
Of this matter / that I make of mencyon
Is good help of friends / and eke of pardon
That avails to them / that in prison be set
wherefore I have / mine auctours for me fette
And so says Innocent / and saint Austyne
That speaks in their books / of this well afyne
And master Raymonde also / speaks of the same
In a book / that is called after his name
And Thomas Alquin / speaks also
Of this matter / and other mo
In a book that is / of great phylosophye
That is called / Ueritas theologye
And to you / I have many matters red
That in this little book / before ben sped
In the which / ye have herd me specyfye
Of the condycyons / of Purgatory
And now I will / no further wend
But of this matter / thus I make an end.
