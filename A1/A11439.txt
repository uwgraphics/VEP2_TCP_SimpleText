THE love of God.
Here is declared, if you will read
That god does love this la^d in deed
By feeling his rod.
ENgland is blessed, and loved of god
who can the same deny
For she has felt his louin^ rod
because she went awrye.
Deserve she did, more to be whypt
her faults they were so great
Who did not se, how far she slypt
from law, and justice seat.
The word so freely taught and preached
as no land had it more
When teachers truly truth them teacht
they set by it no store.
They kept it not in heart and mind
to lead thereby their life.
If they had been to God so kind
then had not come the strife.
But so long as they hard the voise
full still they were as sheep
Al huste and peace, there was no noise
but silence they did keep.
And straight as sermon ended was
they fayd that he said well
But ask them how his words did pass
and then they could not tell.
And some there seemed to be so full
that they would hear no more
Their sprites and ears were waxe^ dull
they cared not therefore.
Al knoledge had they caught and won
as they had in their thought
So that with speed their hearts begone
to set by it as naught.
And fell to sekyng land and good
by rape and eke vnrighte
As men full mad and worldly wood
from measure flyeng quight.
For glory eke and earthly praise
some sought as they were mad
Not sparing by unlawful ways
so they in sylkes were clad.
Promotion some so swiftly sought
to place their blood on hie
That fre^d or foe they spared naught
tho they therefore should dye.
To be forsworn, it was no sin
the custom made it law
So they a life at ease might win
of God they had no awe.
Tho law did will of Idols foyl
but few with will them burst
But al content to take the spoils
not thinkyng them a cursed.
Of pride, of envy, and disdain
Whose heart was not possessed
Of wanton eyes and lusts so vain
Who long from these did rest.
So given to sects and fables fond
so bent to tales untrue
So given to lies as any land
still lustyng things of new.
Who did not se, that had his eyes
these vices so to raygne
That scourge and plague must needs arise
to bring the^ home again.
Then came the rod by death to kyl
the prince that was full good
And let such tyrants have their will
as shed the giltles blood.
At large were set al wicked men
and good men put to thral
Full little thought so soden then
that they should have the baul.
The sins that long had taken rote
and blossoms full did bear
The wyllyng ear and ready foot
false witness for to hear:
Was punished then by Ipocrites
and men that had no God
and such as past not of.ii. mites
to do the thing forbod.
By this means men yt were wtoute
and looked upon our land
Did bring in question and in doubt
how that this gere could stand.
Saying to God he did not love
the English blood at all
Because he did the sweet remove
and sent them bitter gall
To that his word did answer make
and took his cause in hand
Affyrming God not to forsake
the little I Will England.
Whom God does love, then said his lore
the same he does correct
Least they should dye in hell therefore
and so for aye reiecte.
Also to prove and try his vine
he let that the defense
Of romish bores, and sowish swine
should quight be taken thence.
A foreign land to set in foot
he winked at also
To prove a case by form of mote
that sinners might him know.
And whiles the word and carnal men
did reason thus a while
To make yt each his will should ken
he straight began to smyle.
Hold still he said, I will be judge
and sentence straight he gave
quod he to death se that thou trudge
and fyl thou up a grave.
A grave quod he, where may that be
and who shall therein lie
and straight was seen ye english queen
al prone and fyt to dye.
The roussed up death and cast his dart
and cloue her heart in twain
Then lay she dead, yt causde ye smart
that fell upon Britayne.
Death then had thought, yt he had done
and would have taken rest
nay nay said God, thou have begone
therefore I think it best:
That thou do kyl more of my foes
that would my will withstand
Then found he out, as tumor goes
some captains of the band.
He made the^ shri^k for all their brags
and burst their bands in twain
He plucked the^ quite out of their iags
thus by him were they slain.
Lo lo said God, now have I told
my sentence and my will
And I my self have been so bold
my foes by death to kill.
For this let us give thanks to him
and praise his holy name
And now let us with hearts begin
a better life to frame.
Let al confess the mercy of God
the cause to be alone
Why he has cast away his rod
And is with us at one.
prayeng to him, that he will give
unto this ruler sent
A wylling mind while she does live
as always she was bent.
To set up God, and godlynes
the truth for to restore
To banyshe out pope holiness
by law for evermore.
Let al degrees upon their knees
thus pray with one consent
That he which sees our miseries
may better be content.
Now to conclude my meter rude
but matter true and just
se you repent your life mysspent
Or else be sure and trust:
That God will strike, and strike again
a sharper stroke then this
That you shall feel with greater pain
be sure he will not mysse.
Finis.
quod Vvyllyam Samuel.
God save the Queen.
