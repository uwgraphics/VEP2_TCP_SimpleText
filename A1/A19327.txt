and liege men inhabytynge within this our noble realm and Isle of Knavery, and
to al other our subiecctes inhabityng within corners, cotages, baudy stynkyng
lanes and aleys, and other such like, being unfortunate to be hanged,
scourged, burned, or drowned, and to each of them after their meryt or degree,
Be it known to your weak wit and understanding, that after the disposicion
of the wedder, and the Judgment pronosticate by our maladuysed Astrologians, so
wise instruct and expert that often times they know not what day it is when
they rise, nor what hour it is when they go to bed / and after the
constellacion of one of the seven planets, which is unknown which of them it
may be: have said and affyrmed upon pain of their cursed and meschaunt lives
(which peradventure shall be brief unto them of their great dishonor and
shame) that about the beginning of the month of May about mydnyght, shall be
upon us an Eclypse of the son. By occasion whereof, in the somer ensuyng may
engendre, breed, and increase among us many and great multitude of diverse
small and little beestes and bestylons, whose names among us and you be not
unknown / and be called maternally Lyce, Flees, and nyttes / which beestes so
named as we be aduysed shall breed, increase, and grow among us in great
nombre and multitude / and also with them shall breed and increace other bestes
and worms / but not so nygh enioynynge us. As flies, flyeng hearts, hornets,
betles, pysmers, and other such little worms or beestes / which little beestes
or worms shall bear no danger of venym. Also with these little beestes after
the constellacyon before specyfyed, shall increase an other sort or manner of
beestes which shall and will be prejudicial and hurtefull to you, if strong
defense be not had to the contrary. As waspes, lezardes, todes, serpe^tes,
adders, and snakes, and other like venymous beestes.

Therefore seeing and considering these occasyons before pronosticate: we
straytely command upon pain of the punysshment of the bestes aforsayd, as
lyce, flees, and nyttes, each of you our said subjects as well men as women,
that ye may provide haboundau^ce and not over measure / for we find by the
wise instructyon of our inexpert Astrologians and Pronosticatours aforsayd,
that by occasyon of this constellacion above, may be withdrawn out of you our
natural subjects and people, all health and good natural dysposicion / from
the which as we trust our lord shall preserve you. For if ye continue still as
ye be, as one fyndeth you, so shall he leave you, never to thryue.

Furtthermore our unwise Astrologyans and Pronosticatours above rehearsed,
plainly do say and affirm, that if these little worms and beestes aforesaid,
as lyce, flees, and nyttes, be and may inhabyt, increase, and breed among you
and in your array, as doublets, shyrtes, hosen, and such other your garments,
and therein well fed, lodged, and kept, in great multitude and quantytie
innumerable, that that shall be unto you as good as if ye took every day a
purgacyon or lettynge of blood / for they will eat and withdraw all your good
blood from you, and non shall remain but the bad / of the which might grow
great inconvenience in hurtynge your corporal health in diverse manners / as
frou^celynge of your skynnes, small scrapes and scratchynges / scalde scoruy
and scabbed hedes, and other semblables, as stynkyng odours, impostumes, and
other wheles, carnels, and cancres / and all such other and like adventures,
as much now as herafter / as we hope that suddenly shall fall upon you the
constellacyon before rehearsed.

wherefore seeing and considering these occasyons, whereof as we perceive ye
have no care, as of your honor, health, and other goodness to you conuenyent: we
will and commau^de upon the pain aforsayd, that each of you / as well men as
women behave them self to provide in the way and manner aforsayd, or else the
weke shall beat the strong.

And also be it provided, that if chanced ye could not inhabyt and lodge all
these little beestes before specified within all your garments, as hose,
shyrtes, doublets, hedes, and cotes, we effectually ordeyne, establysshe, and
enact (and that upon our great displeasure) that ye lodge and inhabyt them in
manner of garnyson within your beds, houses, and in all other your dwelling
places, in so great multitude and plenty, that they may put out your iyes /
which we pray god may be.

And as concerning the other beestes before named, as serpents, adders,
todes, lezardes, and other such being prejudicial, in that case we will and
command that ye do after your fantastyke folly and will, that is to say, to
take them or leave them / as it pleases you.

Also we command again upon the pains aforsayd to you our subjects
specified, and to all other to whom this dignite belongs, that during the
time, ye be not so bold to pare or cut your nails as ye have used to do in
times passed.

And we by our disordinate counsel of foles idiots, lunatikes, fantastikes,
and melancolous people, have enacted these contemptes aforesaid to the contrary
not withstanding.

wherefore we commau^de upon the pains reherced, to all our head officers, as
common beggars, vacabondes / stelynge pardoners / to the drawers, blind
harpers, berers of falls seals, outlawes, pyllory knights hedge crepers and
all and every our natural officers so loyterynge and ronnynge over and in our
lands, lordeshyps, and contrees, that this present commandment general
plainly may be cried, and with high voice publisshed and declared to man and
woman, dog and cat, with great solempnitie, in such purporte and effect that
may com in easily at their ears and run fast out of their arses, which by
lycklyhood may well be / and no man to the contrary withstanding / for it
pleases us so, and so is our will to be done.

In presence and witness of the lord and Capytayne of mysorder, the Provost
of evil prefe, the Esquier Snyueler, Gautier ye scabbed, Philip the halter, and
many other / as Roger outlaw, Thomas pyllorye, and such other our officers of
our noble Court testifiers.

Fynysshed in our Palais and Abbay enuyronned with all mischief, the.xi. day of
August, and of our reign. M.
