ST PETER'S COMPLAIN

Mary Magdal^ tears With other works of the author R: S:

LONDON Printed for W: Barrett

1620.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, RICHARD Earl of Dorcet, etc.
My Lord,
THe entertainment, which this work, in the several parts thereof has
formerly found with men of exact judgment, may be a sufficient testimony, that
it is not (now) offered unto your Lordship for that it stands in need of
protection (the usual apology of every triuiall Pamphletter,) much less to
^emendicate any others suffrages, beyond the known worth thereof: the only
reason of this present boldness, and my excuse for thus presuming to recommend
it to your Honorable hands, being, that as the Author thereof had long since
dedicated some pieces of the whole to sundry particular branches of that noble
stock and family (whereof your Lordship is, and long may you be a strong and
flourishing arm!) so now my self having first collected these dismembered
parcels into one body, and published them in an entire edition; I held it a
kind of sacrilege to defraud your noble name of the right which you may so
justly challenge thereunto, which by the Sunshine of your favor shall be as it
were reanimated; and He encouraged to further endeavors, who in the mean time
is

At your Lordships service, W. BARRET.

THE AVTHOR TO HIS LOVING COVSIN.
POets by abusing their talent, and making the follies and faynings of Love,
the customarie subject of their base endeavors, have so discredited this
faculty, that a Poet, a Lover, and a Liar, are by many reckoned but three
words of one signification. But the vanity of men cannot counterpoise the
authority of God, who delivering many parts of Scripture in verse, and by his
Apostle willing us to exercise our devotion in Hymns and spiritual Sonnets,
warranteth the Art to be good, and the use allowable. And therefore not only
among the Heathen, whose Gods were chiefly canonized by their Poets, and their
Paynim Divinity oracled in verse: but even in the Old and New Testament, it
has been used by men of greatest piety, in matters of most devotion. Christ
himself by making an Hymn the conclusion of his last Supper, and the prologue
to the first Pageant of his passion, gave his Spouse a method to imitate, as
in the office of the Church it appears; and to all men a pattern to know the
true use of this measured and footed style. But the Devil as he affects
Deity, and seeks to have all the complements of Divine honor applied to his
service, so has he among the rest possessed also most Poets with his idle
fancies. For in lieu of solemn and devout matter, to which in duty they owe
their abilities, they now busy themselves in expressing such passions, as
only serve for testimonies to how unworthy affections they have wedded their
wills. And because the best course to let them see the error of their works,
is to weaue a new web in their own Loome, I have here laid a few course
threeds together, to inuit some skilfuller wits to go forward in the same, or
to begin some finer piece, wherein it may be seen how well verse and virtue
suit together. Blame me not (good Cousin) though I send you a blame-worthie
present: in which the most that can commend it, is the good will of the writer;
neither Art nor Invention giving it any credit. If in me this be a fault, you
cannot be faultlesse that did importune me to commit it, and therefore you
must bear part of the penance, when it shall please sharp censures to impose
it. In the mean time with many good wishes I send you these few Ditties: add
you the Tunes, and let the Mean, I pray you, be still a part in all your
Music.

THE AVTHOR to the Reader.
Dear eye that do
peruse my Muses style,
With easy censure
deem of my delight:
Give sobrest countnance
leave, sometime to smile,
And grauest wits
to take a breathing flight.
Of mirth to make
a trade, may be a crime,
But tired spirits
for mirth must have a time.
The lofty Eagle
soars not still above,
High flights will force
her from the wing to stoop,
And studious thoughts
at times men must remove,
Lest by excess
before their time they droope.
In courser studies
it is a sweet repose,
With Poets pleasing
vain, to temper Prose.
Profane conceits
and faining fits I fly,
Such lawless stuff
does lawless speeches fit:
With David, verse
to Virtue I apply,
Whose measure best
with measurd words does fit:
It is the sweetest
note that man can sing,
When grace in Virtues
key tunes Natures string.
RVRSVS AD EVNDEM.
Dear eye that daynest
to let fall a look,
On these sad memories
of PETER'S plaints:
Muse not to see
some mud in cleerest Brook.
They once were brittle
mould, that now are Saints.
Their weakness is
no warrant to offend,
Learn in their faults,
what in thine own to mend.
If Equities
euen-hand the balance held,
Where PETER'S sins
and ours were made the weights:
Ounce for his dram,
pound for his ounce we yield,
His Ship would groan
to feel some sinners freights.
So ripe is vice,
so green is virtues bud:
The world does wax
in ill, but wane in good.
This makes my mourning
Muse, resolve in tears,
This theames my heavy
pen, to plain in prose,
CHRIST'S Thorn is sharp
no head his Garland wears:
Still finest wits
are stilling VENUS Rose,
In Paynim toys
the sweetest veins are spent:
To Christian works,
few have their Talents lent.
License my single
pen to seek a Pheere,
You heavenly sparks
of wit, show native light:
Cloud not with misty
loves your Orient clear,
Sweet flights you shoot,
learn once to level right.
Fouour my wish,
well-wishing works no ill:
I move the Suit,
the grant rests in your will.
SAINT PETER'S COMPLAINT.
LAnch forth, my soul,
into a maine of tears,
Full fraught with grief,
the traffic of thy mind:
Torn sails will serve,
thoughts rent with guilty fears:
Give care the stern,
use sighs in lieu of wind:
Remorse, thy Pilot:
thy misdeed, thy Card:
Torment thy Haven,
shipwreck thy best reward.
Shun not the shelfe
of most deserved shame:
Stick in the sands
of agonizing dread:
Content thee to
be storms and billows game;
Diuorc't from grace,
thy soul to penance wed:
Fly not from foreign
evils, fly from the heart:
Worse then the worst
of evils, is that thou art.
Give vent unto
the vapors of thy breast,
That thicken in the
brimmes of cloudy eyes:
Where sin was hatched,
let tears now wash the nest,
Where life was lost,
recover life with cries.
Thy trespass foul,
let not thy tears be few.
Baptize thy spotted
soul in weeping dew.
Fly mournful plaints,
the Echoes of my ruth;
Whose screeches in
my frighted conscience ring:
Sob out my sorrows,
fruits of mine untruth:
Report the smart
of sins infernal sting.
Tell hearts that languish
in the soriest plight,
There is on earth
a far more sorry wight.
A sorry wight,
the object of disgrace,
The Monument of fear,
the Map of shame,
The mirror of mishap,
the stain of place,
The scorn of time,
the infamy of fame,
An excrement of earth,
to heaven hateful,
Injurious to man,
to God ungrateful.
Ambitious heads,
dream you of Fortunes pride:
Fill Volumes with
your forged goddess praise,
You Fancies drudges,
plunged in follies tide:
Deuote your fabling
wits to lovers lays:
Be you, O sharpest
griefs that ever wrong,
Text to my thoughts,
Theme to my playning tongue.
Sad subject of
my sin has stoard my mind,
With everlasting
matter of complaint:
My threnes an endless
Alphabet do find,
Beyond the pangs
which Jeremy does paint.
That eyes with errors
may just measure keep,
Most tears I wish,
that have most cause to weep.
All weeping eyes
resign your tears to me:
A sea will scantly
rince my ordur'd soul:
Huge horrors in
high tides must drowned be:
Of every tear
my crime exacteth tole.
These stains are deep:
few drops take out no such:
Even salve with sore:
and most is not too much.
I feared with life
to die; by death to live:
I left my guide,
now left, and leaving God.
To breathe in bliss,
I feared my breath to give:
I feared for heavenly
reign, an earthly rod.
These fears I feared,
fears feeling no mishaps:
O fond, O faint,
O false, O faulty lapse!
How can I live
that thus my life denied?
What can I hope,
that lost my hope in fear?
What trust to one,
that truth it self defied?
What good in him
that did his God forswear?
O sin of sins!
of evils the very worst:
O matchless wretch!
O caytiffe most accursed!
Vain in my vaunts,
I vowed, if friends had failed,
Alone Christ's hardest
fortunes to abide.
Giant in talk;
like dwarf in trial quaild;
Excelling none,
but in untruth and pride.
Such distance is
between high words and deeds.
In proof, the greatest
vanter seldom speeds.
Ah rashness, hasty
rise to murdering leap,
Lavish in vowing,
blind in seeing what:
Soon sowing shames
that long remorse must reap:
Nursing with tears
that ouer-sight begat;
Scout of repentance,
harbinger of blame,
Treason to wisdom,
mother of ill name.
The borne-blind beggar,
for received sight,
Fast in his faith
and love, to Christ remained,
He stooped to
no fear, he feared no might,
No change his choice;
no threats his truth distained.
One wonder wrought
him in his duty sure:
I, after thousands,
did my Lord abjure.
Could servile fear
of rendering Natures due,
Which growth in years
was shortly like to claim,
So thrall my love,
that I should thus eschew
A vowed death,
and miss so fair an aim?
Die, die, disloyal
wretch, thy life detest:
For saving thine,
thou have forsworn the best.
Ah life, sweet drop,
drowned in a sea of sowres,
A flying good,
posting to doubtful end,
Still losing months
and years, to gain new hours:
Feign, time to have,
and spare, yet forced to spend:
Thy growth, decrease,
a moment all thou have:
That gone, ere known:
the rest, to come, or past.
Ah life, the maze
of countlesse straying ways,
Open to erring steps,
and strewn with baits,
To wind weak senses
into endless strayes,
Aloof from virtues
rough unbeaten straits;
A flower, a play,
a blast, a shade, a dream,
A living death,
a never turning stream.
And could I rate
so high a life so base?
Did fear with love
cast so uneven account,
That for this goal
I should run Judas race,
And Caiphas rage
in cruelty surmount?
Yet they esteemed
thirty pence his price.
I, worse then both,
for naught denied him thrice.
The mother Sea,
from ouerflowing deep,
Sends forth her issue
by divided veins:
Yet back her offspring
to their mother creeps,
To pay their purest
streams with added gains;
But I, that drunk
the drops of heavenly flud,
Bemyr'd the giver
with returning mud.
Is this the harvest
of his sowing toil?
Did Christ manure
thy heart, to breed him briers?
Or does it need
this vnaccustom'd soil,
With hellish dung
to fertile heavens desires?
No, no, the Marle
that periuries does yield,
May spoil a good,
not fat a barren field.
Was this for best
deserts, the duest meede?
Are highest worths
well waged with spiteful hire?
Are stoutest vows
repealed in greatest need?
Should friendship, at
the first affront, retire?
Blush, crauen sot,
lurk in eternal night:
Crouch in the darkest
Caves from loathed light.
Ah wretch, why was
I named son of a Dove,
Whose speeches voided
spite, and breathed gall?
No kin I am
unto the bird of love:
My stony name
much better suits my fall,
My oaths were stones;
my cruel tongue the sling:
My God, the mark,
at which my spite did fling.
Were all the Jewish
tyrannies too few
To glut thy hungry
looks with his disgrace:
That thou more hateful
tyrannies must show,
And spot thy poison
in thy Makers face?
Did thou to spare
his foes put up thy sword,
To brandish now
thy tongue against thy Lord?
Ah tongue, that did
his praise and Godhead sound,
How were thou stained
with such detesting words,
That every word
was to his heart a wound,
And launc't him deeper
then a thousand swords?
What rage of man,
yea what infernal Sprite,
Could have disgorg'd
more loathsome dregs of spite?
Why did the yielding
Sea, like Marble way,
Support a wretch
more wavering then the waves?
Whom doubt did plonge,
why did the waters stay?
Unkind, in kindness,
murdering while it saues?
O that this tongue
had then been fishes food,
And I devoured
before this cursing mood!
There surges, depths,
and Seas vnfirme by kind,
Rough gusts, and distance
both from ship and shore,
Were titles to
excuse my staggering mind;
Stout feet might falter
on that liquid floare:
But here no Seas,
no Blasts, no Billows were:
A puff of woman's
wind bred all my fear.
O Coward troops,
far better armed then hearted?
Whom angry words,
whom blows could not provoke:
Whom though I taught
how sore my weapon smarted,
Yet none repaide
me with a wounding stroke.
O no: that stroke
could but one moity kill:
I was reserved
both halfes at once to spill.
Ah, whither was
forgotten love exiled?
Where did the truth
of pledged promise sleep?
What in my thoughts
begat this ugly child,
That could through rented
soul thus fiercely creep?
O Viper, fear
their death by whom thou live,
All good thy ruins
wrecke, all evils thou give.
Threats threw me not,
torments I none assayd:
My fray, with shades:
conceits did make me yield,
Wounding my thoughts
with fears selfely dismayed,
I neither fought
nor lost, I gave the field:
Infamous foil:
a Maidens easy breath
Did blow me down,
and blast my soul to death.
Titles I make
untruths: am I a rock,
That with so soft
a gale was overthrown?
Am I fit Pastor
for the faithful Flock,
To guide their souls,
that murdered thus mine own?
A rock of ruin,
not a rest to stay,
A Pastor, not
to feed, but to betray.
Fidelity was flowne,
when fear was hatched,
Incompatible
brood in virtues nest:
Courage can less
with Cowardice be matched,
Prowess nor love
lodged in divided breast;
O Adams Child,
cast by a silly Eve,
Heir to thy Fathers
foyles, and borne to grieve.
In Thabors joys
I eager was to dwell,
An earnest friend
while pleasures light did shine:
But when eclipsed
glory prostrate fell,
These zealous heates
to sleep I did resign;
And now, my mouth
has thrice his name defiled,
That cried so loud
three dwellings there to build.
When Christ attending
the distressefull hour,
With his surcharged
breast did bless the ground,
Prostrate in pangs,
rayning a bleeding shower,
Me, like my self,
a drowsy friend he found;
Thrice in his care,
sleep closed by careless eye,
Presage how him
my tongue should thrice deny.
Parting from Christ,
my fainting force declined,
With lingering foot
I followed him aloof,
Base fear out of
my heart his love vnshrin'd,
Huge in high words,
but impotent in proof;
My vaunts did seem
hatched under Sampsons locks,
Yet woman's words
did give me murdering knocks.
So far luke warm
desires in crazie love,
Far off in need
with feeble foot they train;
In tides they swim,
low ebbes they scorn to prove,
They seek their friends
delights, but shun their pain,
Hire of an hireling
mind is earned shame:
Take now thy due:
bear thy begotten blame.
Ah, cool remissness,
virtues quartaine fever,
Pyning of love,
consumption of grace:
Old in the cradle,
languor dying ever.
Souls wilful famine,
sins soft stealing pace,
The undermining
evil of zealous thought,
Seeming to bring
no harms till all be brought.
O portresse of
the door of my disgrace;
Whose tongue unlocked
the truth of vowed mind;
Whose words, from Cowards
heart, did courage chase,
And let in death-full
fears my soul to blind:
O had thou been
the portresse to my toombe,
When thou were portresse
to that cursed room.
Yet love was loath
to part; fear, loath to die:
Stay, danger, life,
did counterpleade their causes:
I favoring stay,
and life bad danger fly:
But danger did
except against these clauses:
Yet stay, and live,
I would, and danger shun:
And lost my self,
while I my verdict won.
I stayed, yet did
my staying farthest part:
I lived; but so,
that saving life, I lost it:
Danger I shunned,
but to my sorer smart:
I gained naught,
but deeper damage crossed it.
What danger, distance,
death is worse then this,
That runs from God
and spoils his soul of bliss?
O John, my guide
into this earthly hell,
Too well acquainted
in so ill a Court,
(Where railing mouths
with blasphemies did swell,
With tainted breath
infecting all resort)
Why did thou lead
me to this hell of evils,
To show my self
a Fiend among the Devils?
Evil president,
the tide that wafts to vice.
Dumme-Orator,
that wooes with silent deeds,
Writing in works
lessons of ill advice,
The doing tale
that eye in practice reeds:
Taster of joys:
to unacquainted hunger:
With leaven of
the old, seasoning the younger.
It seems no fault
to do that all have done:
The number of
offenders hide the sin:
Coach drawn with many
horse, does easily run,
Soon follows one
where multitudes begin.
O, had I in
that Court much stronger bin;
Or not so strong
as first to enter in!
Sharp was the weather
in that stormy place,
Best suting hearts
benumbed with hellish frost.
Whose crusted malice
could admit no grace,
Where coals are kindled
to the warmers cost,
Where fear my thoughts
canded with ycie cold:
Heat, did my tongue
to periuries unfold.
O hateful fire
(ah that I never saw it)
Too hard my heart
was frozen for thy force.
Far hotter flames
it did require to thaw it,
Thy hell-resembling
heat did freeze it worse.
O that I rather
had congealed to ice,
Then bought thy warmth
at such a damning price!
O wakefull bird,
proclaimer of the day,
Whose piercing note
does daunt the Lions rage:
Thy crowing did
my self to me bewray,
My frights, and brutish,
heates it did assuage.
But o, in this
alone, unhappy Cock,
That thou to count
my foyles were made the clock.
O bird, the just
rebuker of my crime,
The faithful waker
of my sleeping fears:
Be now the daily
clock to strike the time,
When stinted eyes
shall pay their task of tears,
Vpbraid mine ears
with thine accusing crow,
To make me rue
that first it made me know.
O mild revenger
of aspiring Pride,
Thou can dismount
high thoughts to low effects:
Thou made a Cock
me for my fault to chide,
My lofty boasts
this lowly bird corrects.
Well might a Cock
correct me with a crow,
Whom hennish cackling
first did overthrow.
Weak weapons did
Goliahs fumes abate,
Whose storming rage
did thunder threats in vain:
His body huge,
harnest with massy plate,
Yet David's stone
brought death into his brain.
With staff and sling
as to a dog he came:
And with contempt
did boasting fury tame.
Yet David had
with Bear and Lion fought,
His skillful might
excused Goliahs foil:
The death is eased
that worthy hand has wrought:
Some honor lives
in honorable spoil;
But I, on whom
all infamies must light,
Was hist to death
with words of woman's spite.
Small gnats enforst
The Egyptian King to stoop,
Yet they in swarms
and armed with piercing stings:
Smart, noise, annoyance,
made his courage droupe,
No small incombrance
such small vermin brings:
I quaild at words
that neither bit nor stong,
And those deliuerd
from a woman's tongue.
Ah fear, abortiue
impe of drouping mind:
Self overthrow;
false friend; root of remorse:
Sighted, in seeing
evils; in shunning blind:
Foyld without field;
by fancy not by force;
Ague of valor;
frenzy of the wise;
True honors stain;
loves frost; the mint of lies.
Can virtue, wisdom,
strength by women spild
In David's, Salomons,
and Sampsons falls,
With semblance of
excuse my error guild,
Or lend a marble
gloss to muddy walls?
O no, their fault
had show of some pretense,
No veyle can hide
the shame of my offense.
The blaze of beauties
beams allured their looks:
Their looks, by seeing
often, conceived love:
Love, by effecting,
swallowed pleasures hooks:
Thus beauty, love,
and pleasure them did move.
These Sirens sugared
tunes rockt them asleep:
Enough to damn,
yet not to damn so deep.
But gracious features
dazzled not mine eyes,
Two homely Droyles
were authors of my death:
Not love, but fear,
my senses did surprise:
Not fear of force,
but fear of woman's breath.
And those unarmed,
ill graced, despised, unknown:
So base a blast
my truth has overthrown.
O women, woe
to men: traps for their falls,
Still actors in
all Tragical mischances:
Earths necessary
evils, captiuing thralls,
Now murdering with
your tongues, now with your glances
Parents of life,
and love: spoylers of both,
The thieves of hearts:
false, do you love or loath.
In time, O Lord,
thine eyes with mine did meet,
In them I read
the ruins of my fall.
Their cheering rays
that made misfortune sweet,
Into my guilty
thoughts powrd floods of gall:
Their heavenly looks,
that blessed where they beheld,
Darts of disdain,
and angry checks did yield.
O sacred eyes,
the springs of living light,
The earthly heavens
where Angels joy to dwell,
How could you deigne
to view my deathfull plight,
Or let your heavenly
beams look on my hell?
But those unspotted
eyes encountered mine,
As spotless Sun
does on the dunghill shine.
Sweet volumes stored
with learning fit for Saints,
Where blisfull quires
imparadize their minds,
Wherein eternal
study never faints,
Still finding all,
yet seeking all it finds:
How endless is
your labyrinth of bliss,
Where to be lost
the sweetest finding is?
Ah wretch, how often
have I sweet lessons read,
In those dear eyes
the registers of truth?
How often have I
my hungry wishes fed,
And in their happy
joys redrest my ruth?
Ah that they now
are Heralds of disdain,
That erst were ever
pitiers of my pain!
You flames divine
that sparkle out your heates,
And kindle pleasing
fires in mortal hearts:
You Nectar'd Aumbries
of soul feeding meats,
You graceful quiuers
of loves dearest darts:
You did vouchsafe
to warm, to wound, to feast,
My cold, my stony,
my now famisht breast.
The matchless eyes,
matched only each by other,
Were pleased on my
ill matched eyes to glance:
The eye of liquid
pearl, the purest mother,
Broch't tears in mine
to weep for my mischance;
The cabinets
of grace unlocked their treasure,
And did to my
misdeed their mercies measure.
These blazing Comets,
lightning flames of love,
Made me their warming
influence to know;
My frozen heart
their sacred force did prove,
Which at their looks
did yield like melting snow:
They did not joys
in former plenty carue:
Yet sweet are crumbs
where pined thoughts do starve.
O living mirrours,
seeing whom you show,
Which equal shadows
worths with shadowed things,
Yea make things nobler
then in native hew,
By being shaped
in those life-giuing springs;
Much more my image
in those eyes were graced,
Then in my self,
whom sin and shame defaced.
All-seeing eyes,
more worth then all you see,
Of which one is
the others only price:
I worthless am,
direct your beams on me,
With quickening virtue
cure my killing vice.
By seeing things,
you make things worth the sight,
You seeing, salve,
and being seen delight.
O Pooles of Hesebon,
the baths of grace,
Where happy spirits
dine in sweet desires:
Where Saints delight
to glass their glorious face,
Whose banks make Echo
to the Angels quires,
An Echo sweeter
in the sole rebound,
Then Angels music
in the fullest sound.
O eyes, whose glances
are a silent speech,
In cipherd words
high mysteries disclosing:
Which with a loo^e
all Sciences can teach,
Whose texts to faithful
hearts need little glosing:
Witness unworthy
I, who in a look
Learned more by rote,
then all the Scribes by book.
Though malice still
possessed their hardened minds:
I, though too hard,
learned softness in thine eye,
Which iron knots
of stubburne will vnbinds,
Offering them love,
that love with love will buy:
This did I learn,
yet they could not discern it;
But woe, that I
had now such need to learn it.
O Suns, all but
your selves in light excelling,
Whose presence day,
whose absence causes night,
Whose neighbor course
brings Summer, cold expelling,
Whose distant periods
freeze away delight.
Ah, that I lost
your bright and fostering beams,
To plonge my soul
in these congealed streams!
O gracious Spheres
where love the Center is,
A native place
for our selfe-loaden souls;
The compass love,
a cope that none can miss,
The motion, love
that round about us roules:
O Spheres of love,
whose Center, cope, and motion,
Is love of us,
love that inuites devotion.
O little worlds,
the sums of all the best,
Where glory, heaven,
God, sun, all virtues, stars;
Where fire a love
that next to heaven does rest,
Air, light of life,
that no distemper marres;
The water grace,
whose seas, whose springs, whose showers
Cloth natures earth
with everlasting flowers.
What mixtures these
sweet Elements do yel'd,
Let happy worldlings
of those worlds expound,
But simples are
by compounds far excelled,
Both suit a place,
where all best things abound.
And if a banished
wretch guess not amiss:
All but one compound
frame of perfect bliss.
I, outcast from
these worlds, exiled rome,
Poor Saint, from heaven,
from fire cold Salamander:
Lost fish; from those
sweet waters kindly home,
From land of life,
strayed Pilgrim still I wander.
I know the cause:
these worlds had never hell,
In which my faults
have best deserved to dwell.
O Bethlem cesterns,
David's most desire,
From which my sins
like fierce Philistims keep,
To fetch your drops
what Champion should I hire,
That I therein
my withered heart may steep?
I would not shead
them like that holy King,
His were but types,
these are the figured thing.
O Turtle twins
all bathed in Virgins milk,
Upon the margin
of full flowing banks:
Whose graceful plume
surmounts the finest silk,
Whose sight enamoureth
heavens most happy ranks,
Could I forswear
this heavenly pair of Doves,
That cag'd in care
for me were groaning loves!
Twice Moses wand
did strike the stubburne Rock,
Ere stony veins
would yield their crystal blood:
Thy eyes, one look
served as an only knock,
To make mine heart
gush out a weeping flood:
Wherein my sins
as fishes spawne their fry,
To show their inward
shames, and then to die.
But o, how long
demurre I on his eyes,
Whose look did pierce
my heart with healing wound?
Launcing impostum'd sore
of perjured lies,
Which these two issues
of mine ^yes have found:
Where run it must,
till death the issues stop,
And penal life
has purged the final drop.
Like solest Swan
that swims in silent deep,
And never sings
but obsequies of death,
Sigh out thy plaints,
and sole in secret weep,
In suing pardon,
spend thy perjured breath;
Attire thy soul
in sorrows mourning weed,
And at thine eyes
let guilty conscience bleed.
Still in the Limbecke
of thy doleful breast
These bitter fruits
that from thy sins do grow,
For fuel, self
accusing thoughts be best,
Use fear as fire;
the coals let penance blow;
And seek none other
quintessence but tears,
That eyes may shead
what entered at thine ears.
Come sorrowing tears,
the offspring of my grief,
Scant not your Parent
of a needful aid;
In you I rest,
the hope of wished relief,
By you my sinful
debts must be defrayd:
Your power preuailes,
your sacrifice is grateful,
By love obtaining
life to men most hateful.
Come good effects
of ill-deseruing cause;
Ill gotten impes,
yet virtuously brought forth:
Selfe-blaming probates,
of infringed Laws,
Yet blamed faults
redeeming with your worth;
The signs of shame
in you each eye may read.
Yet while you guilty prove,
you pity plead.
O beams of mercy
beat on sorrows Clowd,
Prove suppling showers
upon my parched ground:
Bring forth the fruit
to your due service vowed,
Let good desires
with like deserts be crowned,
Water young blooming
virtues tender flower,
Sin did all grace
of riper growth devour.
Weep Balm and Myrrh,
you sweet Arabian trees,
With purest gummes
perfume and pearl your ryne:
Shead on your honey drops,
you busy Bees,
I, barraine plant,
must weep unpleasant bryne:
Hornets I hyue,
salt drops their labor plyes,
Sucked out of sin,
and shed by showring eyes.
If David night by night
did bathe his bed,
Esteeming longest days
too short to move:
Inconsolable tears,
if Anna shed,
Who in her son
her solace had forgone,
Then I to days, and weeks,
to months and years,
Do owe the hourly
rent of stintlesse tears.
If love, if loss,
if fault, if spotted fame,
If danger, death,
if wrath or wreck of weal,
Entitle eyes
true heirs to earned blame,
That due remorse
in such events conceal,
That want of tears
might well enrole my name,
As chiefest Saint
in Calendar of shame.
Love, where I loved,
was due, and best deserved,
No love could aim
at more loue-worthy mark
No love more loved
then mine of him I served,
Large use he gave,
a flame for every spark.
This love I lost,
this loss a life must rue,
Yea life is short
to pay the ruth is due.
I lost all that
I had, and had the most,
The most that will
can wish, or wit devise:
I least performed,
that did most vainly boast.
I staynd my fame
in most infamous wise.
What danger then,
death, wrath, or wreck can move
More pregnant cause
of tears then this I prove?
If Adam sought
a veyle to scarf his sin,
Taught by his fall
to fear a scourging hand,
If men shall wish
that hills should wrap them in,
When crimes in final
doom come to be scand,
What Mount, what Cave,
what Center can conceal
My monstrous fact,
which even the birds reveal?
Come shame, the livery
of offending mind,
The ugly shroud
that ouer-shadoweth blame:
The mulct, at which
foul faults are justly fined,
The dampe of sin,
the common sluice of fame,
By which impostum'd
tongues their humors purge,
Light shame on me,
I best deserved the scourge.
Cains murdring hand
imbrude in brothers blood,
More mercy then
my impious tongue may crave:
He killed a rival
with pretense of good,
In hope Gods doubled
love alone to have:
But fear so spoyld
my vanquished thoughts of love,
That perjured oaths
my spiteful hate did prove.
Poor Agar from
her pheere enforced to fly,
Wandering in
Barsabian wilds alone:
Doubting her child
through helpless drought would dye,
Laid it aloof,
and set her down to move.
The heavens with prayers,
her lap with tears she filled:
A mothers love
in loss is hardly stild.
But Agar now
bequeath thy tears to me,
Fears, not effects,
did set a-floate thine eyes:
But wretch I feel
more then was feared of thee.
Ah not my Son,
my soul it is that dies:
It dies for drought,
yet has a spring in sight,
Worthy to die,
that would not live and might.
Fair Absoloms foul faults
compared with mine,
Are brightest sands,
to mud of Sodom Lakes;
High aims, young spirits,
birth of royal line,
Made him play false,
where Kingdoms were the stakes,
He gazed on golden hopes,
whose luster winnes,
Sometime the grauest wits
to grievous sins.
But I, whose crime
cuts off the least excuse,
A Kingdom lost,
but hoped no mite of gain,
My highest mark,
was but the worthless use
Of some few lingering
hours of longer pain;
Ungrateful child,
his Parent he pursude,
I, Giants war
with God himself renude.
Joy, infant Saints;
whom in the tender flower,
A happy storm
did free from fear of sin,
Long is their life
that die in blisfull hour,
Joyful such ends
as endless joys begin.
Too long they live,
that live till they be naught:
Life saved by sin,
base purchase dearly bought.
This lot was mine,
your fate was not so fearce,
Whom spotless death
in Cradle rockt asleep,
Sweet Roses mixed
with Lillies strewn your hearce,
Death Virgin white
in Martyrs red did steep.
Your downy heads
both Pearls and Rubies crowned,
My hoary locks
did female fears confound.
You bleating Ewes;
that wayle this woluish spoil
Of sucking Lambs
new bought with bitter throws,
T'inbalme your babes
your eyes distill their oil,
Each heart to tomb
her child wide rupture shows;
Rue not their death
whom death did but revive:
Yield ruth to me
that lived to die alive.
With easy loss
sharp wrecks did he eschew,
That Sindonlesse
aside did naked slip:
Once naked grace
no outward garment knew,
Rich are his robes
whom sin did never strip,
I rich in vaunts,
displaid prides fairest flags,
Disrobed of grace,
am wrapped in Adams rags.
When traitor to the son,
in Mothers eyes,
I shall present
my humble suit for grace;
What blush can paint
the shame that will arise,
Or write my inward
feeling in my face?
Might she the sorrow
with the sinner see,
Though I despisde,
my grief might pitied be.
But ah, how can her ears
my speech endure,
Or sent my breath
still reeking hellish steeme?
Can mother like,
what did the Son abjure,
Or heart deflowered,
a Virgins love redeem?
The Mother nothing loves
that Son does loath.
Ah loathsome wretch,
detested of them both!
O sister Nymphs,
the sweet renowned pair,
That bless Bethania bounds
with your abode:
Shall I infect
that sanctified air,
Or stain those steps
where Jesus breathed and trod?
No: let your prayers
perfume that sweetened place;
Turn me with Tigers
to the wildest chase.
Could I revived
Lazarus behold,
The third of that
sweet Trinity of Saints;
Would not abstonisht dread,
my senses hold?
Ah yes my heart
even with his naming faints;
I seem to see
a messenger from hell,
That my prepared torments
comes to tell
O John, O James,
we made a triple cord,
Of three most loving
and best loving friends:
My rotten twist
was broken with a word,
Fit now to fuel fire
among the Fiends;
It is not ever true,
though often spoken,
That triple twisted cord
is hardly broken.
The dispossed Devils
that out I threw,
In JESUS name,
now impiously forsworn,
Triumph to see
me caged in their mew,
Trampling my ruins
with contempt and scorn;
My periuries were music
to their dance,
And now they heap disdaines
on my mischance.
Our Rock (say they) is riuen,
O welcome hour!
Our Eagles wings are clipped
that wrought so hie:
Our thundering Cloud made noise,
but cast no shower,
He prostrate lies
that would have sealed the sky,
In woman's tongue
our runner found a rub,
Our Cedar now is shrunk
into a shrub.
These scornful words
vpraid my inward thought,
Proofs of their damned
prompters neighbors voice:
Such ugly guests
still wait upon the naught.
Fiends swarm to souls
that swerve from virtues choice,
For breach of plighted truth,
this true I try;
Ah, that my deed
thus gave my word the lie.
Once, and but once,
too dear a once to twice it,
A heaven, in earth,
Saints, near my self I saw;
Sweet was the sight,
but sweeter loves did spice it,
But sights and loves
did my misdeed withdraw.
From heaven and Saints,
to hell and Devils estranged,
Those sights to frights,
those loves to hates are changed.
Christ, as my God,
was templed in my thought,
As man, he lent mine eyes
their dearest light,
But sin his temple
has to ruin brought:
And now, he lightneth
terror from his sight:
Now of my late
vnconsecrate desires,
Profaned wretch,
I taste the earned hires.
Ah sin, the nothing
that does all things file;
Outcast from heaven,
earths curse, the cause of hell:
Parent of death,
author of our exile,
The wrecke of souls,
the wares that Fiends do sell,
That men to monsters:
Angels turn to Devils:
Wrong of all rights;
self ruin; root of evils.
A thing most done,
yet more then God can do:
Daily new done,
yet never done amiss;
Friended of all;
yet unto all a foe,
Seeming an heaven,
yet banishing from bliss:
Served with toil,
yet paying naught but pain:
Man's deepest loss,
though false, esteemed gain.
Shot, without noise;
wound without present smart:
First seeming light;
proving in fine a lode,
Entering with ease,
not easily won to part,
Far in effects
from that the shows abode;
Endorc't with hope,
subscribed with despair;
Ugly in death,
though life did feign it fair.
O forfeiture of heaven!
eternal debt,
A moments joy;
ending in endless fires;
Our natures scum;
the worlds entangling Net:
Night of our thoughts;
death of all good desires.
Worse then all this:
worse then all tongues can say,
Which man could owe,
but only God defray.
This fawning Viper,
dum till he had wounded,
With many mouths
does now vpbraid my harms:
My sight was veild
till I my self confounded,
Then did I see
the disinchanted charms.
Then could I cut
the Anatomy of sin,
And search with Linxes eyes
what lay within.
Bewitching evil,
that hides death in deceits,
Still borrowing lying shapes
to mask thy face,
Now know I the
deciphring of thy sleights,
A cunning dearly bought
with loss of grace;
Thy sugared poison
now has wrought so well,
That thou have made me
to my self an hell.
My eye reads mournful
lessons to my heart,
My heart does to my thought
the grief expound,
My thought the same
does to my tongue impart,
My tongue the message
in the ears does sound;
My ears back to my heart
their sorrows send,
Thus circling griefs
run round without an end.
My guilty eye
still seems to see my sin,
All things Characters are
to spell my fall,
What eye does read without,
heart rues within,
What heart does rue,
to pensive thought is gall,
Which when the thought
would by the tongue digest,
The ear conueyes it
back into the breast.
Thus gripes in all my parts
do never fail,
Whose only league
is now in bartring pains,
What I ingrosse,
they traffic by retaile,
Making each others
miseries their gains;
All bound for ever,
prentices to care,
Whilst I in shop of shame
trade sorrows ware,
Pleased with displeasing lot
I seek no change,
I wealthiest am,
when richest in remorse;
To fetch my ware
no Seas nor Lands I range.
For customers to buy
I nothing force.
My home bred goods
at home are bought and sold,
And still in me
my interest I hold.
My comfort now
is comfortless to live,
In Orphan state
devoted to mishap:
Rent from the root,
that sweetest fruit did give,
I scorned to graffe in stock,
of meaner sap.
No juice can joy me
but of Iesses flower,
Whose heavenly root
has true reviving power.
At sorrows door I knocked,
they craved my name:
I answered: One,
unworthy to be known.
What one, say they?
One worthiest of blame.
But who? A wretch,
not Gods, nor yet his own.
A man? O no, a beast;
much worse: What creature?
A rock: How called?
the rock of scandale, Peter.
From whence? From Caiphas house:
Ah dwell you there?
Sins farm I rented there,
but now would leave it:
What rent? My soul;
What gain? Unrest, and fear.
Dear purchase. Ah too dear,
will you receive it?
What shall we give?
Fit tears, and times to plain me.
Come in, say they;
thus griefs did entertain me.
With them I rest
true prisoner in their Iayle,
Chayn'd in the iron linkes
of basest thrall,
Till grace vouchsafing
captive soul to bail,
In wonted See
degraded loves install.
Days pass in plaints;
the night without repose,
I wake, to sleep,
I sleep in waking woes.
Sleep deaths ally,
oblivion of tears,
Silence of passiions,
balm of angry sore,
Suspense of loves,
security of fears,
Wraths lenitiue, hearts ease,
storms calmest shore,
Senses and souls repriuall
from all cumbers,
Benumming sense of ill,
with quiet slumbers.
Not such my sleep,
but whisperer of dreams,
Creating strange Chymeras
fayning frights:
Of day discourses
giving fancy theames,
To make dum shows
with worlds of anticke sights,
Casting true griefs
in fancies forged mold,
Brokenly telling tales
rightly foretold.
This sleep most fitly
suiteth sorrows bed,
Sorrow, the smart of evil,
Sins eldest child:
Best, when unkind
in killing whom it bred,
A rack for guilty thoughts,
a bit for wild.
The scourge that whips,
the salve that cures offense:
Sorrow, my bed, and home,
while life has sense.
Here solitary Muses
nurse my griefs,
In silent lonenesse
burying worldly noise,
Attentive to rebukes,
deaf to reliefes,
Pensive to foster cares,
careless of joys;
Ruing life's loss
under deaths dreary roofes,
Solemnizing
my funeral behoofes.
A self content the shroud,
my soul the corse,
The Beer an humble hope,
the herse-clorh, fear;
The mourners thoughts,
in blacks of deep remorse,
The hearse, grace, pity,
love and mercy bear.
My ^eares, my dole,
the Priest a zealous will:
Penance the tomb,
and doleful sighs the knill.
Christ, health of feuer'd soul,
heaven of the mind,
Force of the feeble,
nurse of infant loves,
Guide to the wandering foot,
light to the blind,
Whom weeping winds,
repentant sorrow moves.
Father in care;
mother in tender heart,
Revive and save me,
slain with sinful dart.
If King Manasses sunk
in depth of sin,
With plaints and tears
recovered grace and Crown:
A worthless worm
some mild regard may win,
And lowly creep,
where flying threw it down.
A poor desire I have
to mend my ill,
I should, I would,
I dare not say, I will.
I dare not say, I will;
but wish I may,
My pride is checked,
high words the speaker spilt:
My good, o Lord,
thy gift, thy strength my stay:
Give what thou bidst,
and then bid what thou will.
Work with me what
of me thou do request,
Then will I dare the most,
and vow the best.
Prone look, crossed arms,
bent knee, and contrite heart,
Deep sighs, thick sobs,
dew'd eyes, and postrate prayers,
Most humbly beg release
of earned smart,
And saving shroud
in mercies sweet repaires.
If justice should
my wrongs with rigor wage,
Fears, would dispaires;
ruth, breed a hopeless rage.
Lazar at pitties gate
I vlcered lie,
Craving the reffuse crumbs
of childrens plate:
My sores I lay in view
to mercies eye,
My rags bear witness
of my poor estate;
The worms of conscience
that within me swarm,
Prove that my plaints are less
then is my harm.
With mildness, Jesus,
measure mine offense;
Let true remorse
thy due revenge abate;
Let tears appease
when trespass does incense:
Let pity temper
thy deserved hate.
Let grace forgive,
let love forget my fall,
With fear I crave,
with hope I humbly call.
Redeem my lapse
with ransom of thy love,
Trauerse the indictment,
rigors doom suspend:
Let frailty favor,
sorrows succor move.
Be thou thy self,
though changeling I offend:
Tender my suite,
cleanse this defiled den,
Cancel my debts,
sweet Jesus, say Amen.
The end of S. Peter's Complaint.
MARIE MAGdalens blush.
THe signs of shame
that stain my blushing face,
Rise from the feeling
of my rauing fits:
Whose joy annoy,
whose guerdon is disgrace:
Whose solace flies,
whose sorrow never flits:
Bad seed I sowed,
worse fruit is now my gain,
Soon dying mirth
begat long living pain.
Now pleasure ebbes,
revenge begins to flow,
One day does wreake
the wrath that many wrought:
Remorse does teach
my guilty thoughts to know
How cheap I sold,
what Christ so dearly bought.
Faults long unfelt
does conscience now bewray,
All ghostly dynts
that Grace at me did dart,
Like stubborn rock
I forced to recoyle;
To other flights
an aim I made mine heart,
Whose wounds then welcome,
now have wrought my foil.
Woe worth the bow,
woe worth the Archers might.
That drove such Arrows
to the mark so right.
To pull them out,
to leave them in, is death;
One to this world;
one to the world to come:
Wounds may I wear,
and draw a doubtful breath:
But then my wounds
will work a dreadful doom.
And for a world,
whose pleasures pass away,
I lose a world,
whose joys are past decay.
O sense, o soul,
o had, o hoped bliss,
You woo, you weane,
you draw, you drive me back.
Your cross encountering
like their combat is,
That never end
but with some deadly wrack.
When sense does win,
the soul does lose the field,
And present haps
make future hopes to yield.
O heaven, lament,
sense robs thee of Saints,
Lament, O souls,
sense spoyleth you of Grace:
Yet sense does scarce deserve
these hard complaints.
Love is the thief,
sense but the entering place,
Yet grant I must,
sense is not free from sin,
For thief he is,
that thief admits in.
MARY MAGDALENS complaint at Christ's death.
Since my life from life is parted:
Death, come take thy portion,
Who suruiues, when life is murdered,
Lives by mere extortion.
All that live, and not in God,
Couch their life in deaths abod.
Silly stars must needs leave shining,
When the Sun is shaddowed.
Borrowed streams refrain their running,
When head-springs are hindered.
One that lives by others breath,
Dies also by his death.
O true Life, since thou have left me,
Mortal life is tedious,
Death it is to live without thee,
Death of all most odious.
Turn again, or take me to thee,
Let me dye, or live thou in me.
Where the truth once was and is not,
Shadows are but vanity:
Showing want, that help they cannot,
Signs, not salve of misery.
Painted meat no hunger feeds,
Dying life each death exceeds.
With my love, my life was nestled
In the sum of happiness;
From my love, my life is wrested
To a world of heaviness.
O, let love my life remove,
Since I live not where I love.
O my soul, what did unloose thee
From the sweet captivity?
God, not I, did still possess thee:
His, not mine thy liberty.
O, too happy thrall thou wart,
When thy prison was his heart.
Spiteful spear that break'st this prison,
Seat of all felicity,
Working this, with double treason,
Loves, and lives delivery:
Though my life thou drau'st away,
Maugre thee my love shall stay.
Times go by turns.
THE lopped tree
in time may grow again,
Most naked plants
renew both fruit and flower:
The sorriest wight
may find release of pain,
The driest soil
suck in some moystning shower.
Times go by turns,
and chances change by course,
From foul to fair:
from better hap to worse.
The sea of Fortune
does not ever flow,
She draws her favors
to the lowest ebb;
Her tides have equal times
to come and go,
Her Loome does weaue
the fine and coursest web;
No joy so great,
but runs to an end:
No hap so hard,
but may in fine amend.
Not always Fall of leaf,
nor ever Spring,
No endless night,
nor yet eternal day:
The saddest Birds
a season find to sing,
The roughest storm
a calm may soon allay.
Thus with succeeding turns
God tempereth all:
That man may hope to rise,
yet fear to fall.
A chance may win
that by mischance was lost,
That net that holds no great,
takes little fish;
In some things all,
in all things none are crossed:
Few all they need,
but none have all they wish.
Unmingled joys
here to no man befall:
Who least, has some,
who most, has never all.
LOOK HOME.
Retired thoughts enjoy
their own delights,
As beauty does
in selfe-beholding eye:
Man's mind a mirror is
of heavenly sights,
Abriefe wherein
all maruels summed lie:
Of fairest forms,
and sweetest shapes the store,
Most graceful all,
yet thought may grace them more.
The mind a creature is,
yet can create,
To Natures patterns
adding higher skill:
Of finest works,
wit better could the state,
If force of wit
had equal power of will.
Device of man
in working has no end:
What thought can think,
another thought can mend.
Man's soul of endless
beauties image is,
Drawn by the work
of endless skill and might;
This skillful might
gave many sparks of bliss,
And to discern this bliss,
a native light,
To frame Gods image
as his worths required,
His might, his skill,
his word, and will conspired.
All that he had,
his Image should present,
All that it should present,
he could afford;
To that he could afford,
his will was bent,
His will was followed
with performing word.
Let this suffice,
by this conceive the rest,
He should, he could,
he would, he did the best,
Fortunes falsehood.
IN worldly merriments
lurketh much misery:
Sly Fortunes subtilties,
in bayts of happiness,
Shroud hooks; that swallowed
(without recovery)
Murder the innocent
with mortal heaviness.
She sootheth appetites
with pleasing vanities,
Till they be conquered
with cloaked tyranny:
Then, changing countenance,
with open enmities,
She triumphs over them,
scorning their slavery.
With fawning flattery
Deaths door she opens,
Alluring passingers
to bloody destiny:
In offers bountiful,
in proof she beggereth;
Men's ruins registring
her false felicity.
Her hopes are fastened
in bliss that vanishes,
Her smart inherited
with sure possession,
Constant in cruelty,
she never alters,
But from one violence,
to more oppression.
To those that follow her,
favors are measured
As easy premises
to hard conclusions;
With bitter corrosiues
her joys are seasoned;
Her highest benifits
are but illusions.
Her way's a labyrinth
of wandering passages:
Fools common pilgrimage,
to cursed deities:
Whose fond devotion
and iole menages,
Are waged with weariness
in fruitless drudgeries.
Blind, in her favorites
foolish election,
Ch^n^^ is ^er A^^^rer
a giving dignity:
He^ choice of visions,
sh^w^s most discretion,
Since ^^^^th, the virtuous
might wrest from piety.
To humble suppliants,
tyrant most obstinate:
She suitors answers
with contrarieties.
Proud with petition,
untaught to mitigate
Rigor with clemency
in hardest cruelties.
Like Tygre fugitive
from the Ambitious,
Like weeping Crocodile
to scornful enemies,
Suing for amity
where she is odious,
But to her followers
forswearing courtesies.
No wind so changeable,
no sea so wavering,
As giddie Fortune
in reeling varieties;
Now mad, now merciful,
now fierce, now favoring:
In all things mutable,
but mutabilities.
Scorn not the least.
Where wards are weak,
and foes incountring strong,
Where mightier do assault
then do defend,
The feebler part
puts up enforced wrong,
And silent sees,
that speech could not amend;
Yet higher powers must think,
though they repine,
When Sun is set,
the little stars will shine.
While Pike does range,
the silly Tench does fly,
And crouch in privy creekes,
with smaller fish:
Yet Pikes are caught
when little fish go by,
These fleet aflote,
while those do fill the dish;
There is a time
even for the worms to creep,
And suck the deaw
while all their foes do sleep.
The Marline cannot
ever soar on high,
Nor greedy Grey-houn
still pursue the chase:
The tender Lark
will find a time to fly,
And fearful Hate
to run a quiet race.
He that high growth
on Cedars did bestow,
Gave also lowly Mushrumps
leave to grow.
In Hamans pomp
poor Mardocheus wept,
Yet God did turn
his fate upon his foe,
The Lazar pinde,
while Dives feast was kept,
Yet he to heaven,
to hell did Dives go.
We trample grass,
and prize the flowers of May,
Yet grass is green,
when flowers do fade away.
The Nativity of Christ.
BEhold, the Father
is his daughters son:
The bird that built the nest,
is hatched therein:
The old of years,
an hour has not out-runne:
Eternal life, to live
does now begin.
The Word is du^,
the mirth of heaven does weep,
Might feeble is,
and force does faintly creep.
O dying souls,
behold your living spring;
O dazzled eyes,
behold your Sun of grace;
Dull ears, attend what word
this Word does bring,
Up, heavy hearts,
with joy your joy embrace:
From death, from dark,
from deafness, from dispaires,
This life, this light,
this Word, this joy repaires.
Gift better then himself,
God does not know:
Gift better then his God,
no man can see;
This gift does here
the giver given bestow,
Gift to this gift
let each receiver be.
God is my gift,
himself he freely gave me.
Gods gift am I,
and none but God shall have me.
Man altered was
by sin from man to beast:
Beasts food is hay,
hay is all mortal flesh,
Now God is flesh,
and lies in Manger pressed
As hay, the brutest sinner
to refresh:
O happy field
wherein this fodder grew,
Whose taste does us
from beasts to men renew.
Christ's Childhood.
TIll twelve years age,
how Christ his childhood spent,
All earthly pens
unworthy were to write,
Such acts to mortal eyes
he did present,
Whose worth, not men,
but Angels must recite.
No natures blots,
no childish faults defilde,
Where grace was guide,
and God did play the child
In springing locks,
lay couched hoary wit,
In semblance young,
a grave and ancient port,
In lowly looks,
high majesty did sit:
In tender tongue,
sound sense of sagest sort,
Nature imparted all
that she could teach,
And God supplied,
where Nature could not reach.
His mirth of modest mean
a mirror was,
His sadness, tempered
with a mild aspect;
His eye to try
each action was a glass,
Whose looks did good approve,
and bad correct.
His Natures gifts,
his grace, his word and deed,
Well showed that all
did from a God proceed.
A Child my Choice.
LEt folly praise
that fancy loves:
I praise and love that child,
Whose heart no thought,
whose tongue no word,
whose hand no deed defiled.
I praise him most,
I love him best,
all praise and love is his;
While him I love,
in him I live,
and cannot live amiss.
Loves sweetest mark,
lauds highest Theme;
man's most desired light;
To love him life,
to leave him, death;
to live in him, delight.
He mine by gift,
I his by debt,
thus each to other's due:
First friend he was,
best friend he is,
all times will try him true.
Though young yet wise,
though small yet strong,
though man, yet God he is,
As wise, he knows,
as strong, he can,
as God he loves to bliss:
His knowledge rules,
his strength defends,
his love does cherish all,
His birth our joy,
his life our light,
his death our end of thrall.
Alas, he weeps,
he sighs, he pants,
yet do his Angels sing:
Out of his tears,
his sighs and throbs,
does bud a joyful Spring.
Almighty Babe,
whose tender arms,
can force all foes to fly,
Correct my faults,
protect my life,
direct me when I die.
Content and rich.
I Dwell in Graces Court,
Enrich with Virtues rights,
Faith guides my wit, Love leads my will,
Hope all my mind delights.
In lowly vales I mount
To pleasures highest pitch:
My silly shroud true Honor brings,
My poor estate is rich.
My conscience is my Crown,
Contented thoughts, my rest,
My heart is happy in it self,
My bliss is in my breast.
Enough, I reckon wealth,
A mean, the surest lot,
That lies too high for base contempt,
Too low, for Enuies shot.
My wishes are but few,
All easy to fulfill:
I make the limits of my power,
The bounds unto my will.
I have no hopes but one,
Which is of heavenly reign:
Effects attaind, or not desired,
All lower hopes refrain^.
I feel no care of coin,
Well-doing is my wealth,
My mind to me an Empire is,
While grace affoordeth health.
I clyp high-climing thoughts,
The wings of swelling pride,
Their fall is worst, that from the height
Of greater honor slide.
Since sails of largest size
The storm does soonest tear,
I bear so low and small a sail
As freeth me from fear.
I wrestle not with rage,
While furies flame does burn,
It is in vain to stop the stream,
Until the tide does turn.
But when the flame is out,
And ebbing wrath does end,
I turn a late enraged foe
Into a quiet friend.
And taught with often proof,
A tempered calm I find
To be most solace to it self.
Best cure for angry mind.
Spare diet is my fare,
My clothes more fit then fine,
I know, I feed, and clothe a foe,
That pamp'red, would repine.
I envy not their hap
Whom favor does advance;
I take no pleasure in their pain
That have less happy chance.
To rise by others fall,
I deem a losing gain;
All states with others ruins built,
To ruin run amain.
No change of Fortunes calmes
Can cast my comforts down:
When Fortune smiles, I smile to think
how quickly she will frown.
And when in froward mood,
She proou'd an angry so,
Small gain I found to let her come,
Less loss to let her go.
Loss in delays.
SHun delays, they breed remorse,
Take thy time while time does serve thee,
Creeping Snayles have weakest force,
Fly their fault, lest thou repent thee.
Good is best, when soonest wrought,
Lingering labors come to naught.
Hoyse up sail while gale does last,
Tide and wind stay no man's pleasure;
Seek not time, when time is past,
Sober speed is Wisdoms leisure:
After-wits are dearly bought,
Let thy fore-wit guide thy thought.
Time wears all his locks before,
Take thou hold upon his forehead,
When he flies, he turns no more,
And behind his scalpe is naked.
Works adiourn'd have many stays,
Long demurres breed new delays.
Seek thy salve while sore is green,
Festered wounds ask deeper launcing;
After-cures are seldom seen,
Often sought, scarce ever chancing.
Time and place gives best advice,
Out of season, out of price.
Crush the Serpent in the head,
Break ill eggs ere they be hatched:
Kill bad Chickins in the tread;
Fligge, they hardly can be catched,
In the rising stifle ill,
Lest it grow against thy will.
Drops do pierce the stubburne Flint,
Not by force, but often falling,
Custom kills with feeble dint,
More by use, then strength prevailing,
Single sands have little weight,
Many make a drowning freight.
Tender twigs are bent with ease,
Aged trees do break with bending,
Young desires make little prease,
Growth does make them past amending.
Happy man that soon does knock
Babels Babes against the rock.
Love servile Lot.
Love Mistress is of many minds,
Yet few know whom they serve,
They reckon least how little Love
Their service does deserve.
The will she robs from the wit,
The sense from reasons lore,
She is delightful in the ryne,
Corrupted in the core.
She shrowdeth vice in Virtues veil,
Pretending good in ill,
She offers joy, affoordeth grief,
A kiss where she does kill.
A honey shower raines from her lips,
Sweet lights shine in her face.
She has the blush of Virgin mind,
The mind of Vipers race.
She makes thee seek, yet fear to find,
To find, but none enjoy;
In many frowns some gliding smiles
She yields to more annoy.
She wooes thee to come near her fire,
Yet does she draw it from thee.
Far off she makes thy heart to fry,
And yet to freeze within thee.
She lets fall some luring baits
For fools to gather up:
Too sweet, too sour, to every taste
She tempereth her cup.
Soft souls she binds in tender twist,
Small Flies in spinners web,
She sets aflote some luring streams,
But makes them soon to ebb.
Her watrie eyes have burning force:
Her floods and flames conspire:
Tears kindle sparks, sobs fuel are:
And sighs do blow her fire.
May never was the Month of love,
For May is full of flowers,
But rather April wet by kind,
For love is full of showers.
Like Tyrant cruel wounds she gives,
Like Surgeon salve she lends:
But salve and sore have equal force,
For death is both their ends.
With soothing words, enthralled souls
She chains in servile bands,
Her eye in silence has a speech,
Which eye best understands.
Her little sweet has many sowres,
Short hap immortal harms,
Her loving looks, are murdrings darts,
Her songs bewitching charms.
Like Winter Rose, and Summer Ice,
Her joys are still untimely,
Before her hope, behind remorse,
Fair first, in fine unseemly.
Moodes, passions, fancies, jealous fits
Attend upon her train,
She yields rest without repose,
A Heaven in hellish pain.
Her house is sloth, her door deceit,
And slipperie hope her stairs,
Vnbashfull boldness bids her guests,
And every vice repaires.
Her diet is of such delights,
As please till they be past,
But then the poison kills the heart,
That did entice the taste.
Her sleep in sin, does end in wrath,
Remorse rings her awake,
Death calls her up, shame drives her out,
Despaires her vpshot make.
Plow not the Seas, sow not the sands,
Leave off your idle pain,
Seek other mistress for your minds,
Loves service is in vain.
Life is but Loss.
BY force I live,
in will I wish to dye,
In plaint I pass
the length of lingering days,
Free would my soul
from mortal body fly,
And tread the tracke
of Deaths desired ways;
Life is but loss,
where death is deemed gain,
And lothed pleasures
breed displeasing pain.
Who would not dye,
to kill all murdering greeues?
Or who would live
in neuer-dying fears?
Who would not wish
his treasure safe from Thieves,
And quit his heart from pangs,
his eyes from tears?
Death parts but
two ever fighting foes,
Whose civil strife
does work our endless woes.
Life is a wandering course
to doubtful rest,
As often a cursed rise
to damning leap;
As happy race
to win a heavenly crest,
None being sure,
what final fruits to reap.
And who can like
in such a life to dwell,
Whose ways are strait to Heaven,
but wide to Hell?
Come cruel death,
why lingrest thou so long?
What does withhold thy dint
from fatal stroke?
Now pressed I am:
alas, thou do me wrong,
To let me live
more anger to provoke:
Thy right is bad,
when thou have stopped my breath,
Why should'd thou stay,
to work my bouble death?
If Saul's attempt
in falling on his blade,
As lawful were,
as ethe to put in ure:
If Sampsons leave,
a common Law were made,
Of Abels lot
if all that would were sure:
Then cruel death,
thou should the Tyrant play
With none but such
as wished for delay.
Where life is loved,
thou ready art to kill,
And to abridge
with sudden pangs their joy,
Where life is loathed,
thou will not work their will,
But do adiourne their death
to their annoy.
To some thou art
a fierce unbidden guest:
But those that crave thy help
thou helpest least.
Auant oh viper,
I thy spite defy,
There is a God
that ouer-rules thy force,
Who can thy weapons
to his will apply,
And shorten or prolong
our brittle course:
I on his mercy,
not thy might rely,
To him I live,
for him I hope to dye.
I dye alive.
O Life what lets thee
from a quick decease?
O death what draws thee
from a present prey?
My feast is done,
my soul would be at ease,
My grace is said,
O Death, come take away.
I live, but such a life
as ever dies:
I dye, but such a death,
as never ends,
My death to end
my dying life denies,
And life my living death
no whit amends.
Thus still I dye,
yet still I do revive,
My living death
by dying life is fed:
Grace more then Nature
keeps my heart alive,
Whose idle hopes
and vain desires are dead.
Not where I breathe,
but where I love, I live,
Not where I love,
but where I am, I dye:
The life I wish,
must future glory give,
The deaths I feel,
in present dangers lie.
What joy to live?
I Wage no war,
yet peace I none enjoy,
I hope, I fear,
I frye in freezing cold,
I mourn in mirth,
still prostrate in annoy,
I all the World embrace,
yet nothing hold.
All wealth is want
where chiefest wishes fail,
Yea life is loathed,
where love may not prevail.
For that I love, I long,
but that I lack;
That others love, I loath,
and that I have:
All worldly fraights
to me are deadly wrack,
Men, present hap,
I, future hopes do crave.
They loving where they live,
long life require,
To live where best I love,
death I desire.
Here love is lent
for love of filthy gain,
Most friends befriend themselves
with friendships show:
Here, plenty, peril,
want, does breed disdain,
Cares common are,
joys faulty, short and few.
Here Honor enuide,
meannesse is despised,
Sin deemed solace,
Virtue little pris'd.
Here beauty is a bait,
that swallowed choakes,
A treasure sought
still to the owners harms:
A light that eyes
to murdring sights prouokes,
A grace that souls inchants
with mortal charms.
A luring aim
to Cupids fiery flights,
A balefull bliss
that damnes where it delights.
O who would live,
so many deaths to try,
Where will does wish
that wisdom does reprove?
Where Nature craves
that grace must needs deny,
Where sense does like,
that reason cannot love,
Where best in show,
in final proof is worst,
Where pleasures vp-shot
is to dye accursed.
Life's death, Loves life.
Who lives in love, loves least to live,
And long delays does rue,
If him he love by whom he lives,
To whom all love is due.
Who for our love did choose to live,
And was content to dye;
Who loved our love more then his life,
And love with life did buy.
Let us in life, yea with our life
Requite his living love,
For best we live, when least we live.
If love our life remove.
Where love is hot, life hateful is,
Their grounds do not agree,
Love where it loves, life where it lives,
Desires most to be.
And since love is not where it lives,
Nor lives where it loves,
Love hates life, that holds it back,
And death it best approues.
For seldom is he won in life,
Whom love does most desire:
If won by love, yet not enjoyed,
Till mortal life expire.
Life out of earth, has not aboade,
In earth love has no place,
Love settled has her joys in Heaven,
In earth life all her grace.
Mourn therefore no true lovers death,
Life only him annoyes.
And when he takes leave of life,
Then love begins his joys.
At home in Heaven.
Fair soul, how long
shall veiles thy graces shroud?
How long shall this exile
withold thy right?
When will thy Sun
disperse this mortal cloud,
And give thy glories scope
to blaze their light?
O that a star
more fit for Angels eyes,
Should pine in earth,
not shine above the skies!
This ghostly beauty
offered force to God,
It chained him in
the linkes of tender love,
It won his will
with man to make abode:
It staid his sword,
and did his wrath remove;
It made the rigor
of his Justice yield,
And crowned mercy
Empress of the field.
This lulled our heavenly Sampson
fast asleep,
And laid him in
our feeble Natures lap;
This made him under
mortal load to creep,
And in our flesh
his Godhead to inwrap;
This made him soiourne
with us in exile,
And not disdain
our titles in his style.
This brough him from
the ranks of heavenly Quires,
Into the vale of tears,
and cursed soil;
From flowers of grace
into a world of briars,
From life to death,
from bliss to balefull toil.
This made him wander
in our Pilgrim weed,
And taste our torments,
to relieve our need.
O soul, do not
thy noble thoughts abase,
To lose thy love
in any mortal wight:
Content thine eye at home
with native grace,
Since God himself
is ravished with thy sight.
If on thy beauty
God enamoured be,
Base is thy love
of any less then he.
Give not assent
to muddie minded skill,
That deemes the feature
of a pleasing face,
To be the sweetest bait
to lure the will,
Not valuing right
the worth of ghostly grace.
Let God and Angels
censure win belief,
That of all beauties
judge our selves the chief.
Queen Hester was
of rare and peerlesse hiew,
And Judith once
for beauty bare the vaunt,
But he that could
our souls endowments view,
Would soon to souls
the Crown of beauty grant.
O soul, out of thy self
seek God alone:
Grace more then thine,
but Gods, the world has none,
Lewd Love is loss.
MIsdeeming eye
that stoopeth to the lure
Of mortal worths,
not worth so worthy Love,
All beautie's base,
all graces are impure,
That do thy erring thought
from God remove.
Sparks to the fire,
the beams yield to the Sun,
All grace to God,
from whom all graces run.
If picture move,
more should the pattern please:
No shadow can
with shadowed things compare,
And fairest shapes
whereon our loves do seize,
But silly signs
of Gods high beauties are.
Go, staruing sense,
feed thou on earthly mast,
True love in Heaven,
seek thou thy sweet repast.
Gleane not in barren soil
these off all ears,
Since reap thou may
whole haruests of delight.
Base joys with griefs,
bad hopes do end in fears,
Lewd love with loss,
evil peace with deadly fight:
Gods love alone does end
with endless ease,
Whose joys in hope,
whose hope concludes in peace:
Let not the luring train
of fancies trap,
Or gracious features
proofs of Natures skill,
Lull reasons force asleep
in errors lap,
Or draw thy wit
to bent of wanton will,
The fairest flowers
have not the sweetest smell,
A seeming Heaven
proves often a damning Hell.
Selfe-pleasing souls
that play with beauties bait,
In shining shroud
may swallow fatal hook,
Where eager sight,
on semblant fair does wait,
A lock it proves
that first was but a look:
The fish with ease
into the Net does glide,
But to get out,
the way is not so wide.
So long the Fly
does dally with the flame,
Until his singed wings
do force his fall:
So long the eye
does follow Fancies game,
Till love has left the heart
in heavy thrall;
Soon may the mind
be cast in Cupids Iayle,
But hard it is
imprisoned thoughts to bail.
O loathe that love,
whose final aim is lust,
Moth of the mind,
eclipse of reasons light,
The grave of grace,
the mole of Natures rust,
The wrack of wit,
the wrong of every right;
In sum, an evil,
whose harms no tongue can tell,
In which to live
is death, to dye is Hell.
Loves Garden grief.
Vain loves auaunt,
infamous is your pleasure,
Your joy deceit,
Your jewels, jests,
and worthless trash your treasure,
Fools common bait.
Your palace is
a prison that allureth
To sweet mishap,
and rest that pain procures.
Your Garden grief,
hedged in with thorns of Envy,
And stakes of strife,
Your Allies error,
grauelled with jealousy,
And cares of life.
Your banks are seats
enwrapt with shades of sadness,
Your Arbours breed
rough fits of raging madness.
Your beds are sown
with seeds of all iniquity,
And poys'ning weeds:
Whose stalks ill thoughts,
whose leaves words full of vanity,
Whose fruit misdeeds.
Whose sap is sin,
whose force and operation,
To banish grace,
and work the souls damnation.
Your trees are dismal plants
of pyning corrosiues,
Whose root is ruth,
Whose bark is bale,
whose timber stubburne fantasies,
Whose pith untruth.
On which in lieu of birds
whose voice delights,
Of guilty conscience
screeching note affrighteth.
Your coolest Summer gales
are scadling sighings,
Your showers are tears.
Your sweetest smell
the stench of sinful living.
Your favors fears;
Your Gardener Satan,
all you reap is misery:
Your gain remorse,
and loss of all felicity.
From Fortunes reach.
LEt fickle Fortune run
her blindest race:
I settled have
an unremoved mind:
I scorn to be
the game of Fancies chase,
Or vane to show
the change of every wind:
Light giddie humors
stinted to no rest,
Still change their choice,
yet never choose the best.
My choice was guided
by foresightfull heed,
It was auerred
with approving will,
It shall be followed
with performing deed:
And sealed with vow,
till death the chuser kill,
Yea death, though final date
of vain desires,
Ends not my choice,
which with no time expires.
To beauties fading bliss
I am no thrall;
I bury not my thoughts
in metal Mines,
I aim not at such fame,
as fears fall,
I seek and find a light
that euer-shines:
Whose glorious beams
display such heavenly sights,
As yield my soul
a sum of all delights.
My light to love,
my love to life does guide
To life that lives by love,
and loves light:
By love to one,
to whom all loves are tied
By duest debt,
and never equal right.
Eyes light, hearts love,
souls truest life he is,
Consorting in three joys,
one perfect bliss.
A FANCY TVRNED to a Sinners Complaint.
HE that his mirth has lost,
Whose comfort is to rue,
Whose hope is fallen, whose faith is cras'd,
Whose trust is found untrue.
If he have held them dear,
And cannot cease to moan;
Come, let him take his place by me,
He shall not rue alone.
But if the smallest sweet
Be mixed with all his sour;
If in the day, the month, the year,
He feel one lightning hour:
Then rest he with himself,
He is no mate for me;
Whose time in tears, whose race in ruth,
Whose life a death must be.
Yet not the wished death,
That feels no pain or lack:
That making free the better part,
Is only Natures wrack.
O no, that were too well,
My death is of the mind;
That always yield, extremest pangs,
Yet threatens worse behind.
As one that lives in show,
And inwardly does dye:
Whose knowledge is a bloody field,
Where Virtue slain does lie.
Whose heart the Altar is,
And host, a God to move:
From whom my ill does fear revenge,
His good does promise love.
My Fancies are like thorns,
In which I go by night;
My frighted wits are like an host,
That force has put to flight.
My sense is passions spy,
My thoughts like ruins old,
Which show how fair the building was,
While grace did it uphold.
And still before mine eyes,
My mortal fall they lay;
Whom grace and virtue once advanced,
Now sin has cast away.
O thoughts, no thoughts but wounds,
Sometime the Seat of joy,
Sometime the store of quiet rest,
But now of all annoy.
I sowed the soil of peace,
My bliss was in the spring;
And day by day the fruit I eat,
That Virtues tree did bring.
To Nettles now my corn,
My field is turned to flint;
Where I a heavy harvest reap,
Of cares that never stint.
The peace* the rest, the life,
That I enjoyed of yore,
Were happy lot, but by their loss,
My smart does sting the more.
So to unhappy men,
The best frames to the worst:
O time, o place where thus I fell,
Dear then, but now accursed.
In was, stands my delight,
In is, and shall my woe,
My horror fastened in the yea,
My hope hangs in the no.
Unworthy of relief,
That craved is too late;
Too late I find, (I find too well)
Too well, stood my estate.
Behold, such is the end,
That pleasure does procure,
Of nothing else but care and plaint.
Can she the mind assure.
Forsaken first by grace,
By pleasure now forgotten,
Her pain I feel, but graces wage
Have others from me gotten.
Then grace, where is the joy,
That makes thy torments sweet?
Where is the cause, that many thought
Their deaths through thee but meet?
Where thy disdain of sin,
Thy secret sweet delight;
Thy sparks of bliss, thy heavenly joys,
That shined erst so bright?
O that they were not lost,
Or I could it excuse;
O that a dream of fained loss,
My judgment did abuse.
Or frail inconstant flesh,
Soon trapt in every ginne;
Soon wrought thus to betray thy soul,
And plonge thy self in sin.
Yet hate I but the fault,
And not the faulty one.
Ne can I rid from me the mate,
That forces me to moan:
To moan a sinners case,
Then which, was never worse;
In Prince or poor, in young, or old,
In blessed, or full of curse.
Yet Gods must I remain;
By death, by wrong, by shame,
I cannot blot out of my heart,
That grace writ in his name:
I cannot set at naught,
Whom I have held so dear:
I cannot make him seem afar,
That is in deed so near.
Not that I look henceforth
For love that erst I found;
Since that I brake my plighted truth,
To build on fickle ground.
Yet that shall never fail,
Which my faith bare in hand:
I gave my vow, my vow gave me,
Both vow and gift shall stand.
But since that I have sinned,
And scourge none is too ill;
I yield me captive to my curse,
My hard fate to fulfill.
The solitary Wood,
My City shall become,
The darkest dens shall be my Lodge,
In which I rest or come.
A sandy plot my board,
The worms my feast shall be,
Wherewith my carcass shall be fed,
Until they feed on me.
My tears shall be my wine,
My bed a craggy Rock;
My harmony the Serpents hiss,
The screeching Owl my clock.
My exercise remorse,
And doleful sinners lays,
My book remembrance of my crimes,
And faults of former days.
My walk the path of plaint,
My prospect into hell;
Where Judas and his cursed crew
In endless pains do dwell.
And though I seem to use
The faining Poets style,
To figure forth my careful plight,
My fall and my exile:
Yet is my grief not feigned,
Wherein I starve and pine,
Who feels the most, shall think it least,
If his compare with mine.
David's Peccaui.
IN Eaues, sole Sparrow sits
not more alone,
Nor mourning Pelican
in Desert wild,
Then silly I,
that solitary moan,
From highest hopes
to hardest hap exilde:
Sometime (o blissful time)
was virtues meede,
Aim to my thoughts,
guide to my word and deed.
But fears are now my Pheeres,
grief my delight,
My tears my drink,
my famisht thoughts, my bread;
Day full of dumps,
Nurse of unrest the night,
My garments gyues,
a bloody field my bed,
My sleep is rather death,
then deaths allye,
Yet killed with murdering pangs,
I cannot dye.
This is the chance
of my ill changed choice,
To pleasant tunes
succeeds a playning voice,
The doleful echo
of my wayling mind:
Which taught to know
the worth of virtues joys,
Does hate it self
for loving fancies toys.
If wiles of wit
had ouer-raught my will,
Or subtle trains
misled my steps awry,
My foil had found
excuse in want of skill,
Ill deed I might,
though not ill doom deny:
But wit and will
must now confess with shame,
Both deed and doom
to have deserved blame.
I Fancy deemed
fit guide to lead my way,
And as I deemed,
I did pursue the tracke;
Wit lost his aim,
and will was Fancies prey,
The Rebels wan,
the Rulers went to wrack:
But now since Fancy
did with folly end,
Wit bought with loss,
Will taught by wit, will mend.
Sins heavy load.
O Lord, my sins
do ouer-charge thy breast,
The poyse thereof
does force thy knees to bow;
Yea flat thou fallest
with my faults oppressed,
And bloody sweat
runs trickling from thy brow:
But had they not
to Earth thus pressed thee,
Much more they would
in Hell have pestred me.
This Globe of Earth
does thy one finger prop,
The world thou do
within thy hand embrace;
Yet all this weight,
of sweat drew not a drop,
Ne made thee bow,
much less fall on thy face:
But now thou have
a load so heavy found,
That makes thee bow,
yea fall flat to the ground.
O sin, how huge
and heavy is thy weight!
That waighest more
then all the world beside.
Of which when Christ
has taken in his freight,
The poyse thereof
his flesh could not abide.
Alas, if God himself
sink under sin,
What will become of man
that dies therein?
First, flat thou fell'st,
when earth did thee receive,
In closet pure
of Mary's virgin breast;
And now thou fall'st,
of earth to take thy leave,
Thou kissest it
as cause of thy unrest:
O loving Lord,
that so do love thy fo,
As thus to kiss the ground
where he does go.
Thou minded in thy heaven
our earth to wear,
Do prostrate now thy heaven,
our earth to bliss;
As God, to earth
thou often were severe:
As man, thou call'st
a peace with bleeding kiss.
For as of souls
thou common Father art,
So is she Mother
of man's other part.
She shortly was to drink
thy dearest blood,
And yield the soul
a way to Satan's cave;
She shortly was
thy corse in tomb to shroud,
And with them all
thy Deity to have:
Now then in me
thou jointly yeeldest all,
That severally to earth
should shortly fall.
O prostrate Christ,
erect my crooked mind:
Lord, let thy fall
my flight from Earth obtain;
Or if I needs must still
in Earth be shrin'd,
Then Lord, on Earth
come fall yet once again:
And either yield
in Earth with me to lie,
Or else with thee
to take me to the sky.
Joseph's Amazement.
WHen Christ by growth
disclosed his descent,
Into the pure receipt
of Mary's breast;
Poor Joseph, stranger yet
to Gods intent,
With doubts of jealous thoughts
was sore oppressed:
And wrought with diverse fits
of fear and love,
He neither can her free,
nor faulty prove.
Now since the wakefull spy
of jealous mind,
By strong conjectures
deemeth her defiled;
But love in doom of things
best loved blind,
Thinks rather sense deceived,
then her with child:
Yet proofs so pregnant were,
that no pretense,
Could cloak a thing
so clear and plain to sense.
Then Joseph daunted
with a deadly wound,
Let loose the reins
of undeserved grief;
His heart did throb,
his eyes in tears were drowned,
His life a loss,
death seemed his best relief:
The pleasing relish
of his former love,
In gaulish thoughts
to bitter taste does prove.
One foot he often
sets out of door,
But the other loath
uncertain ways to tread;
He takes his fardell
for his needful store,
He casts his Inn
where first he means to bed:
But still ere he
can frame his feet to go,
Love wins time,
till all conclude in no.
Sometimes grief adding force,
he does depart,
He will against his will
keep on his pase:
But straight remorse
so rackes his raging heart,
That hasting thoughts
yield to a pawsing pase:
Then mighty reasons
press him to remain,
She whom he flies
does win him home again.
But when his thought
by sight of his abode,
Presents the sign
of misesteemed shame,
Repenting every step
that back he troad,
Tears done, the guide,
the tongue, the feet do blame.
Thus warring with himself,
a field he fights,
Where every wound
upon the giver lights.
And was (quoth he)
my love so lightly pris'd,
Or was our sacred league
so soon forgot?
Could vows be void,
could virtues be despised;
Could such a spouse,
be stained with such a spot?
O wretched Joseph,
that has lived so long,
Of faithful love
to reap so grievous wrong!
Could such a worm
breed in so sweet a Wood?
Could in so chaste demeanure
lurk untruth?
Could vice lie hid
where Virtues image stood?
Where hoarie sagenesse
graced tender youth?
Where can affiance rest,
to rest secure?
In virtues fairest seat,
faith is not sure.
All proofs did promise hope
a pledge of grace,
Whose good might have
repaid the deepest ill;
Sweet signs of purest thoughts
in Saintly face,
Assured the eye
of her unstained will.
Yet in this seeming luster,
seem to lie
Such crimes, for which
the Law condemns to dye.
But Joseph's word
shall never work her woe,
I wish her leave to live,
not doom to dye;
Though Fortune mine,
yet am I not her fo,
She to her self
less loving is then I.
The most I will,
the least I can is this,
Since none may salve,
to shun that is amiss.
Exile my home,
the wilds shall be my walk,
Complaint my joy,
my Music mourning lays;
With pensive griefs
in silence will I talk:
Sad thoughts shall be
my guides in sorrows ways.
This course best suits
the care of careless mind,
That seeks to lose,
what most it joyed to find.
Like stocked tree
whose branches all do fade,
Whose leaves do fall,
and perished fruit decay;
Like herb that grows
in cold and barren shade,
Where darkness drives
all quickening heat away;
So dye must I,
cut from my root of joy,
And thrown in darkest shades
of deep annoy.
But who can fly
from that his heart does feel?
What change of place
can change implanted pain?
Removing, moves
no hardness from the steel.
Sick hearts, that shift no fits,
shift rooms in vain:
Where thought can see,
what helps the closed eye?
Where heart pursues,
what gains the foot to fly?
Yet did I tread a maze
of doubtful end;
I go, I come,
she draws, she drives away,
She wounds, she heales,
she does both mar and mend,
She makes me seek,
and shun, depart, and stay:
She is a friend to love,
a fo to loathe,
And in suspense
I hang between them both.
New Prince, new Pomp.
BEhold a silly tender Babe,
In freezing Winter night,
In homely Manger trembling lies;
Alas a piteous sight:
The Innes are full, no man will yield
This little Pilgrim bed;
But forced he is with silly beasts,
In Crib to shroud his head.
Despise him not for lying there,
First what he is enquire:
An orient pearl is often found
In depth of dirtie mire.
Weigh not his Crib, his wooden dish,
Nor beasts that by him feed:
Weigh not his Mothers poor attire,
Nor Joseph's simple weed.
This Stable is a Princes Court,
The Crib his chair of State:
The Beasts are parcel of his Pomp,
The wooden dish his plate.
The persons in that poor attire,
His royal liueries wear,
The Prince himself is come from heaven,
This pomp is prized there.
With joy approach, O Christian wight,
Do homage to thy King;
And highly praise his humble Pomp,
Which he from Heaven does bring.
The burning Babe.
AS I in hoarie Winters night,
stood shiuering in the snow,
Surprised I was with sudden heat,
which made my heart to glow;
And lifting up a fearful eye,
to view what fire was near,
A pretty Babe all burning bright,
did in the air appear;
Who, scorched with excessive heat,
such floods of tears did shed,
As though his floods should quench his flames,
which with his tears were bred:
Alas, (quoth he) but newly borne,
in fiery heates I fry,
Yet none approach to warm their hearts
or feel my fire but I;
My faultlesse breast the furnace is,
the fuel wounding thorns:
Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke,
the ashes shames and scorns;
The fuel Justice lays on,
and mercy blows the coals,
The metal in this Furnace wrought,
are men's defiled souls:
For which, as now on fire I am,
to work them to their good,
So will I melt into a bath,
to wash them in my blood.
With this he vanished out of sight,
and swiftly shronke away,
And straight I called unto mind,
that it was Christmasse day.
New Heaven, new War.
COme to your heaven, you heavenly Quires,
Earth has the heaven of your desires:
Remove your dwelling to your God,
A stall is now his best abode;
Since men their homage do deny,
Come Angels all, their fault supply.
His chilling cold does heat require,
Come Seraphins in lieu of fire;
This little Arc no cover has,
Let Cherubs wings his body swathe:
Come Raphael, this Babe must eat,
Provide our little Toby meat.
Let Gabriel be now his groom;
That first took up his earthly room;
Let Michael stand in his defense,
Whom love has linkt to feeble sense:
Let graces rock when he does cry,
Let Angels sing his lullaby.
The same you saw in heavenly seat,
Is he that now suckes Mary's teate,
Agnize your King a mortal wight,
His borrowed weed lets not your sight
Come kiss the manger where he lies,
That is your bliss above the skies.
This little Babe, so few days old,
Is come to rifle Satan's fold;
All hell does at his presence quake,
Though he himself for cold do shake:
For in this weak unarmed wise,
The gates of hell he will surprise.
With tears he fights and wins the field,
His naked breast stands for a shield;
His battering shot are babish cries,
His arrows, looks of weeping eyes,
His Martial Ensigns, cold and need,
And feeble flesh, his warriers Steed.
His Camp is pitched in astall,
His bulwark but a broken wall:
The Crib his trench, hay-stalkes his stakes,
Of Shepherds he his Muster makes;
And thus as sure his fo to wound,
The Angels trumps alarm sound.
My soul, with Christ join thou in fight,
Stick to the tents, that he has dight;
Within his crib is surest ward,
This little Babe will be thy guard:
If thou will foil thy foes with joy,
Then flit not from the heavenly Boy.
FINIS.

LONDON. Printed for W. Barret.

The Virgin Mary's conception.
OUR second Eve
puts on her mortal shroud,
Earth breeds a heaven,
for Gods new dwelling place,
Now rises up
Elias little cloud
That growing, shall
distill the shower of grace:
Her being now begins,
who ere she end,
Shall bring our good
that shall our ill amend.
Both Grace and Nature
did their force unite,
To make this babe
the sum of all their best,
Our most, her least,
our million, but her mite:
She was at easiest rate
worth all the rest:
What grace to men
or Angels God did part,
Was all united
in this infants heart.
Four only wights,
bred without fault are named,
And all the rest
conceived were in sin;
Without both man and wife
was Adam framed,
Of man, but not of wife
did Eve begin:
Wife without touch of man
Christ's mother was,
Of man and wife
this babe was borne in grace.
Her Nativity.
Joy in the rising
of our Orient star,
That shall bring forth
the Sun that lent her light,
Joy in the peace
that shall conclude our war,
And soon rebate
the edge of Satan's spite.
Load-starre of all
enclosed in worldly waves,
The care and compass
that from ship-wracke saues:
The patriarchs and Prophets
were the flowers,
Which time by course
of ages did distill,
And called into
his little clowd the showers,
Whose gracious drops
the world with joy shall fill,
Whose moisture suppleth
every soul with grace,
And brings life
to Adams dying race.
For God on earth
she is the royal throne,
The chosen cloth
to make his mortal weed,
The quarry to cut out
our corner stone,
Soil full of fruit,
yet free from mortal seed,
For heavenly flower
she is the Iessa rod,
The child of man,
the parent of a god.
Her Spousals.
WIfe did she live,
yet virgin did she dye,
Untouched of man,
yet mother of a son,
To save her self
and child from fatal lie,
To end the web
whereof the thread was spon,
In marriage knots
to Joseph she was tide,
Unwonted works
with wonted wiles to hide.
God lent his Paradise
to Joseph's care,
Wherein he was
to plant the tree of life:
His son, of Joseph's child
the title bare:
Just cause to make
the mother Joseph's wife.
O blessed man
betrothed to such a spouse,
More blessed to live
with such a child in house.
No carnal love
this sacred league procured,
All vain delights
were far from their assent,
Though both themselves
in wedlock bands assured,
Yet chaste by vow
they sealed their chaste intent.
Thus had the Virgins,
wives, and widows crown,
And by chaste childbirth
doubled their renown.
The virgins salutation.
SPell Eua back,
and Aue shall you find;
The first began,
the last reuerst our harms;
An Angels Aue
disinchants the charms,
Death first by woman's
weakness entered in,
In woman's virtue
life does now begin.
O Virgins breast,
the heavens to thee incline,
In thee they joy,
and sovereign they agnize;
Too mean their glory is
to match with thine,
Whose chaste receipt
God more then heaven did prize,
Hail fairest heaven,
that heaven and earth do bliss,
Where virtues star,
Gods Sun of justice is,
With haughty mind
to godhead man aspired,
And was by pride
from place of pleasure chac'de,
With loving mind
our manhood God desired,
And us by love
in greater pleasure plac'de,
Man laboring to ascend
procured our fall,
God yielding to descend
cut off our thrall.
The Visitation.
PRoclaimed Queen
and mother of a God,
The light of earth,
the sovereign of Saints,
With Pilgrim foot,
up tyring hills she trod,
And heavenly style
with handmaids toil acquaints:
Her youth to age,
her self to sick she lends,
Her heart to God,
to neighbor hand she bends.
A prince she is,
and mightier prince does bear,
Yet pomp of princely train
she would not have,
But doubtless heavenly Quires
attendant were,
Her child from harm
her self from fall to save:
Word to the voice,
song to the tune she brings,
The voice her word,
the tune her ditty sings.
Eternal lights
enclosed in her breast,
Shot out such piercing beams
of burning love,
That when her voice
her cosins ears possessed,
The force thereof
did force her babe to move,
With secret signs
the children greet each other,
But open praise
each leaves to his mother.
His Circumcision.
THe head is launc't
to work the bodies cure,
With angry salve
it smarts to heal our wound:
To faultlesse Son
from all offenses pure,
The faulty vassals
scourges do redound.
The Judge is cast
the guilty to acquit,
The Sun defaced
to lend the star his light,
The vine of life
distilleth drops of grace:
Our rock gives issue
to an heavenly spring,
Tears from his eyes,
blood runs from wounding place,
Which showers to heaven
of joy an harvest bring.
This sacred deaw
let Angels gather up:
Such dainty drops
best fit their nectar'd cup:
With weeping eyes
his mother rewd his smart,
If blood from him,
tears came from her as fast,
The knife that cut his flesh
did pierce her heart,
The pain that Jesus felt
did Marie taste,
His life and hers
hung by one fatal twist,
No blow that hit the Son
the mother mist.
The Epiphanie.
TO blaze the rising
of this glorious Sun
A glittering star
appears in the East,
Whose sight to pilgrims toil
three sages wun,
To feeke the light
they long had in request:
And by this star
to nobler star they pace,
Whose arms did their
desired sin embrace:
Stall was the sky
wherein those planets shinde,
And want the cloud
that did eclipse their rays,
Yet through this cloud
their light did passage find,
And pierced these sages hearts
by secret ways,
Which made them know
the ruler of the skies,
By infant tongue and looks
of babish eyes:
Heaven at her light,
earth blusheth at her pride,
And of their pomp
these peers ashamed be,
Their crowns, their robes,
their trains they set aside,
When Gods poor cottage,
clouts, and crew they see.
All glorious things
their glory now despise,
Since God Contempt
duth more then Glory prise,
Three gifts they bring,
three gifts they bear away;
For incense, mirrhe, and gold,
faith, hope, and love;
And with their gifts
the giuers heart do stay:
Their mind from Christ,
no parting can remove,
His humble state,
his stall, his poor retinew
They fancy more
then all their rich reuenew.
The Presentation.
TO be redeemed
the worlds redeemer brought,
Two silly turtle doves
for ransom paies:
O wares with empires
worthy to be bought!
This easy rate does sound,
not drown thy praise,
For since no price
can to thy worth amount,
A dove, yea love,
due price thou do account.
Old Simeon,
cheap penny worth and sweet,
Obtaind when thee in arms
he did embrace,
His weeping eyes
thy smiling looks did meet,
Thy love his heart,
thy kisses blessed his face.
O eyes, O heart,
mean sights and loves avoid,
Base not your selves,
your best you have enioyde:
O virgin pure
thou do those doves present,
As due to law,
not as an equal price;
To buy such ware
thou would thy self have spent,
The world to reach his worth
could not suffice.
If God were to be bought,
not worldly pelf,
But thou were fittest price
next God himself.
The flight into Egypt
ALas, our day is forced
to fly by night,
Light without light,
and Sun by silent shade;
O nature blush,
that suffrest such a wight,
That in thy Sun
thy dark eclipse have made
Day to his eyes,
light to his steps deny,
That hates the light
which graceth every eye.
Sun being fled,
the stars do lose their light,
And shining beams
in bloody streams they drench.
A cruel storm
of Herod's mortal spite,
Their lives and lights
with bloody showers do quench:
The tyrant to be sure
of murdring one,
For fear of sparing him
does pardon none.
O blessed babes,
first flowers of Christian spring,
though untimely cropped
raire garlands frame;
With open throats
and silent mouths you sing,
His praise, whom age
permits you not to name.
Your tunes are tears,
your instruments are swords,
Your dittie death,
and blood in lieu of words.
Christ's return out of Egypt.
WHen death and hell
their right in Herod claim,
Christ from exile
returns to native soil:
There, with his life
more deeply death to maime,
Then death did life
by all the infants spoil.
He showed the parents
that the babes did moan,
That all their lives
were less then his alone.
But hearing Herod's son
to have the crown,
The impious offspring
of a bloody sire;
To Nazareth
(of heaven beloved) town,
Flower to a flower
he fitly does retire.
For he is a flower,
and in a flower he bred,
And from a thorn
now to a flower he fled.
And well deserved this flower
his fruit to view,
Where he invested was
in mortal weed,
Where first into
a tender bud he grew,
In virgin branch
unstained with mortal seed.
Young flower, with flowers,
in flower well may he be:
Ripe fruit he must
with thorns hang on a tree.
Christ's bloody sweat.
FAt soil, full spring,
sweet olive, grape of bliss,
That yields, that streams,
that powers, that do distill:
Untilled, vndrawne,
vnstampt, untouched of press,
Dear fruit, clear brooks,
fair oil, sweet wine at will:
Thus Christ vnforst,
preuents in shedding blood:
The whips, the thorns,
the nail, the spear, and roode.
He Pellicans,
he Phoenix fate does prove,
Whom flames consume
when streams enforce to dye.
How burns blood,
how bleedeth burning love?
Can one in flame,
and stream both bathe and fry?
How would he join
a Phoenix fiery pains,
In foinring Pellicans
still bleeding veins?
Christ's sleeping friends.
When Christ with care
and pangs of death oppressed,
From frighted flesh
a bloody sweat did rain,
And full of fear
without repose or rest:
Did watch and pray
in agony and pain,
Three sundry times
he his disciples finds
With heavy eyes,
with dull and heavy minds;
With mild rebuke
he warned them to wake,
Yet sleep did still
their drowsy senses hold:
As when the Sun
the brightest show does make,
In darkest shrowds
the night birds them infold.
His foes did watch.
to work their cruel spite,
His drowsy friends
slept in his hardest night.
As Jonas sailed
once from Ioppaes shore,
A boystrous tempest
in the air did broile,
The waves did rage,
the thundering heavens did roar,
The storms, the rocks,
the lightnings threatened spoil,
The ship was billows game
and chances pray,
Yet careless Jonas
mute and slumbring lay:
So now though Judas
like a blustering gust,
Do stir the furious sea
of Jewish ire,
Though storming troops
in quarrels most unjust,
Against the bark
of all our bliss conspire,
Yet these disciples
sleeping lie secure,
As though their wonted calm
did still endure.
So Jonas once
his heavy limbs to rest,
Did shroud himself
in iuy pleasant shade:
But lo, while him
an heavy sleep oppressed,
His shadowy bower,
to withered stalk did fade;
A cankered worm
did gnaw the root away,
And brought the glorious
branches to decay.
O gracious plant,
O tree of heavenly spring,
The paragon for leaf,
for fruit and flower,
How sweet a shadow
did thy branches bring,
To shroud those souls
that chose thee for their bower?
But now while they
with Jonas fall asleep,
To spoil their plant
an envious worm does creep.
Awake you slumbring wights,
lift up your eyes,
Mark Judas how
to tear your root he strives.
Alas the glory
of your arbor dies,
Arise and guard
the comfort of your lives.
No Jonas iuy,
no Zacheus tree,
Were to the world
so great a loss as he.
The virgin Mary to Christ on the Cross.
WHat mist has dimd that glorious face?
what seas of grief my Sun does toss?
The golden rays of heavenly grace,
lie now eclipsed on the cross:
Jesus my love, my son, my God,
behold thy mother washed in tears:
Thy bloody wounds be made a rod,
to chasten these my latter years.
You cruel Jews come work your ire,
upon this worthless flesh of mine:
And kindle not eternal fire,
by wounding him which is divine.
Thou messenger that did impart
his first descent into my womb,
Come help me now to cleave my heart,
that there I may my son intombe.
You Angels all that present were
to show his birth with harmony,
Why are you not now ready here
to make a mourning symphony?
The cause I know you wail alone,
and shed your tears in secrecy,
Lest I should moved be to moan,
by force of heavy company.
But wail my soul, thy comfort dies,
my woeful womb lament thy fruit,
My heart give tears unto mine eyes,
let sorrow string my heavy lute.
An holy Hymn.
PRaise, O Sion, praise thy Savior,
Praise thy captain, and thy pastor,
With hymns and solemn harmony.
What power affords perform indeed,
His works all praises far exceed:
No praise can reach his dignity.
A special theme of praise is read,
A living and life giving bread
Is on this day exhibited
Within the Supper of our Lord,
To twelve disciples at his board,
As doubtless it was delivered.
Let our praise be loved and free,
Full of joy and decent glee,
With minds and voices melody.
For now solemnize we that day,
Which does with joy to us display,
The secret of this mystery,
At this board of our new ruler,
Of old law, and Pascall order,
The ancient right abolisheth:
Old decrees, by new annil'd.
Shadows are in truth fulfilled,
Day former darkness finisheth.
That at supper Christ performed,
To be done he straightly charged,
For his eternal memory.
Guided by his sacred orders,
Bread and wine upon our alters,
To saving host we sanctify.
Christians are by faith assured,
That by faith flesh is received,
And Christ his blood most precious:
That no wit no sense conceiueth,
Firm and grounded faith believes,
In strange effects not curious.
As staff of bread thy heart sustaines,
And cheerful wine thy strength regaines,
By power and virtue natural:
So does this consecrated food,
Them symbol of Christ flesh and blood,
By virtue supernatural.
The ruins of thy soul repair,
Banish sin, horror, and despair,
And feed faith, by faith received:
Angels bread made Pilgrims feeding,
Truly bread for childrens eating,
To dogs not to be offered:
Signed by Isack on the altar,
By the Lamb and pascall Supper,
And in the Manna figured.
Jesus food and feeder of us
Here with mercy feed and friend us,
Then grant in heaven felicity.
Lord of all whom here thou feedest,
Fellow heirs, guests with thy dearest,
Make us in thy heavenly city.
S. Peter's afflicted mind.
IF that the sick may groan,
Or Orphane mourn his loss:
If wounded wretch may rue his harms
Or caitife show his cross:
If heart consumed with care,
May utter sign; of pain,
Then may my breast be sorrows home
And tongue with cause complain.
My malady is sin,
And languor of the mind,
My body but a lazars couch,
Wherein my soul is pinde.
The care of heavenly kind
Is dead to my relief,
Forlorn and left like orphan child;
With sighs I feed my grief.
My wounds with mortal smart,
My dying soul torment,
And prisoner to mine own mishaps,
My follies I repent.
My heart is but the haunt
Where all dislikes do keep:
And who can blame so lost a wretch,
Though tears of blood he weep?
S. Peter's remorse.
REmorse vpbraids my faults,
Self blaming conscience cries,
Sin claims the host of humbled thoughts,
And streams of weeping eyes.
Let penance Lord prevail,
Let sorrow sue release,
Let love be vmpier in my cause,
And pass the doom of peace.
If doom go by desert,
My least desert is death,
That robs from soul immortal joys,
From body mortal breath.
But in so high a God,
So base a worms annoy,
Can add no praise unto thy power,
No bliss unto thy joy.
Well may I fry in flames,
Due fuel to hellfire,
But on a wretch to wreake thy wrath,
Can not be worth thine ire.
Yet since so vile a worm
Has wrought his greatest spite,
Of highest treason well thou may,
In rigor him indite.
But mercy may relent
And temper justice rod,
For mercy does as much belong,
As justice to a God.
If former time or place
More right to mercy win,
Thou first were author of my self,
Then vmpier of my sin.
Did mercy spin the thread,
To weaue in justice loome,
Were thou a father to conclude,
With dreadful Judges doom,
It is a small relief
To say I was thy child,
If as an ill deserving foe
From grace I am exilde.
I was, I had, I could,
All words importing want:
They are but dust of dead supplies,
Where needful helps are scant.
Once to have been in bliss
That hardly can return,
Does not bewray from whence I fell,
And wherefore now I mourn.
All thoughts of passed hopes
Increase my present cross:
Like ruins of decayed joys,
They still vpbraid my loss.
O mild and mighty Lord,
Amend that is amiss:
My sin my sore, thy love my salve,
Thy cure my comfort is.
Confirm thy former deeds,
Reform that is defild:
I was, I am, I will remain,
Thy charge, thy choice, thy child.
Man to the wound in Christ's side.
O Pleasant sport, o place of rest,
O royal rift, o worthy wound,
Come harbor me a weary guest,
That in the world no case have found.
I lie lamenting at thy gate,
Yet dare I not adventure in:
I bear with me a troublous mate,
And combred am with heap of sin:
Discharge me of this heavy load,
That easier passage I may find,
Within this bower to make abode,
And in this glorious tomb be shrin'd.
Here must I live, here must I die,
Here would I utter all my grief:
Here would I all those pains descrie,
Which here did meet for my relief.
Here would I view that bloody sore,
Which dint of spiteful spear did breed:
The bloody wounds laid there in store
Would force a stony heart to bleed.
Here is the spring of trickling tears,
The mirror of all mourning wights,
With doleful tunes, for dumpish ears,
And solemn shows for sorrowed sights.
O happy soul that flies so hie,
As to attain this sacred cave:
Lord send me wings that I may fly,
And in this harbor quiet have.
Upon the Image of death.
BEfore my face the picture hangs,
That daily should put me in mind,
Of those cold names and bitter pangs,
That shortly I am like to find:
But yet alas, full little I
Do think hereon that I must die.
I often look upon a face
Most ugly, grisly, bare, and thin,
I often view the hollow place,
Where eyes and nose had sometimes bin:
I see the bones acrosse that lie:
Yet little think that I must die.
I read the Labell underneath,
That tells me whereto I must:
I see the sentence eke that says,
Remember man thou art dust:
But yet alas but seldom I,
Do think indeed that I must die.
Continually at my beds head,
An hearse does hang which does me tell,
That I ere morning may be dead,
Though now I feel my self full well:
But yet alas, for all this I
Have little mind that I must die.
The gown which I do use to wear,
The knife wherewith I cut my meat,
And eke that old and ancient chair,
Which is my only usual seat:
All these do tell me, I must die,
And yet my life amend not I.
My ancestors are turned to clay,
And many of my mates are gone,
My yongers daily drop away,
And can I think to escape alone?
No, no, I know that I must die,
And yet my life amend not I.
Not Solomon for all his wit,
Nor Sampson though he were so strong,
No king nor person ever yet
Could escape, but death laid him along:
Wherefore I know that I must die,
And yet my life amend not I.
Though all the East did quake to hear,
Of Alexanders dreadful name,
And all the West did likewise fear,
To hear of Julius Caesar's fame,
Yet both by death in dust now lie,
Who then can escape, but he must die?
If none can escape deaths dreadful dart,
If rich and poor his beck obey,
If strong, if wise, if all do smart,
then I to escape shall have no way.
Oh grant me grace O God that I,
My life may mend, since I must die.
A vale of tears.
A Vale there is, enwrapt
with dreadful shades,
Which thick of mourning pines
shrowds from the Sun,
Where hanging cliffes
yield short and dumpish glades,
And snowy floods
with broken streams do run,
Where eye-roome is
from rock to cloudie sky,
From thence to dales
which stormy ruins shroud,
Then to the crushed
waters frothie fry,
Which tumbleth from
the tops where snow is showed;
Where ears of other sound
can have no choice,
But various blustering
of the stubburne wind,
In trees, in caves,
in straits with diverse noise,
Which now does hiss,
now howl, now roar by kind:
Where waters wrestle
with encountering stones,
That break their streams,
and turn them into foame,
The hollow clouds
full fraught with thundering groans,
With hideous thumps
discharge their pregnant womb.
And in the horror
of this fearful quier,
Consists the music
of this doleful place:
All pleasant birds
their tunes from thence retire,
Where none but heavy notes
have any grace.
Resort there is
of none but pilgrim wights,
That pass with trembling foot
and panting heart,
With terror cast
in cold and shuddring frights,
And all the place
to terror framed by art:
Yet natures work
it is of art untouched,
So strait indeed,
so vast unto the eye,
With such disordred order
strangely coucht,
And so with pleasing
horror low and hie,
That who it viewes
must needs remain aghast,
Much at the work,
more at the makers might,
And muse how Nature
such a plot could cast,
Where nothing seemed wrong,
yet nothing right:
A place for mated minds,
an only bower,
Where every thing
does sooth a dumpish mood.
Earth lies forlorn,
the cloudie sky does lower,
The wind here weeps,
her sighs, her cries aloud:
The struggling flood
between the marble groans,
Then roaring beats
upon the craggie sides,
A little off amidst
the pibble stones,
With bubling streams
a purling noise it glides.
The pines thick set,
high grown, and ever green,
Still cloth the place
with shade and mourning veil,
Here gaping cliffes,
there moss grown plain is seen;
Here hope does spring,
and there again does quail.
Huge massy stones
that hang by tickle stay,
Still threaten foul,
and seem to hang in fear:
Some withered trees
ashamed of their decay,
Beset with green,
and forced gray coats to wear.
Here crystal springs
crept out of secret vain,
Strait finds some envious hole
that hides their grain.
Here seared tufts
lament the wants of g ace,
There thunder wrack
gives terror to the place.
All pangs and heavy passions
here may find
A thousand motives
suting to their griefs,
To feed the sorrows
of their troubled mind,
And chase away
dame pleasures vain reliefes.
To plaining thoughts
this vale a rest may be,
To which from worldly toys
they may retire,
Where sorrow springs
from water, stone, and tree,
Where every thing
with mourners does conspire.
Sit here my soul,
mourn streams of tears aflote,
Here all thy sinful foyles
alone recount;
Of solemn tunes
make thou the dolefulst note,
That to thy ditties
dolor may amount.
When Echo does repeat
thy painful cries,
Think that the very stones
thy sins bewray,
And now accuse thee
with their sad replies,
As heaven and earth
shall in the latter day:
Let former faults
be fuel of the fire,
For grief in Limbeck e
of thy heart to still
Thy pensive thoughts,
and dumps of thy desire,
And vapor tears
up to thy eyes at will.
Let tears to tunes,
and pains to plaints be pressed,
And let this be
the burden to thy song,
Come deep remorse,
possess my sinful breast:
Delights adue
I harbored you too long.
The prodigal child's soule-wracke.
DIsankerd from a blisfull shore,
and lancht into the maine of cares,
Grewne rich in vice, in virtue poor,
from freedom fallen in fatal snares:
I found my self on every side
enwrapped in the waves of woe,
And tossed with a toilesome tide,
could to no port for refuge go.
The wrestling winds with raging blasts
still hold me in a cruel chase:
They break my anchors, sail, and masts,
permitting no reposing place.
The boistrous seas with swelling floods,
on every side did work their spite,
Heaven ouercast with stormy clouds
denide the Planets guiding light.
The hellish furies lay in wait,
to win my soul into their power,
To make me bite at every bait,
wherein my bane I might devour.
Thus heaven and hell, thus sea and land,
thus storms and tempests did conspire,
With just revenge of scourging hand,
to witness Gods deserved ire.
I plonged in this heavy plight,
found in my faults just cause to fear:
My darkness taught to know my light,
the loss thereof enforced tears.
I felt my inward bleeding sores,
my festred wounds began to smart,
Stepped far within deaths fatal doors,
the pangs thereof went near my heart.
I cried truce: I craved peace,
a league with death I would conclude,
But vain it was to sue release,
subdue I must or be subdude.
Death and deceit had picht their snares,
and out their wonted proofs in ure,
To sink me in despairing cares,
or make me stoop to pleasures lure:
They sought by their bewitching charms,
so to enchant my erring sense,
That when they sought my greatest harms,
I might neglect my best defense.
My dazzled eyes could take no view,
no heed of their deceiving shifts,
So often did they alter hew,
and practice new devised drifts:
With Sirens songs they fed mine ears,
till luld asleep on errors lap,
I found their tunes turned into tears,
and short delights to long mishap.
For I enticed to their lore,
and soothed with their idle toys,
Was trained to their prison door,
the end of all such flying joys:
Where chaind in sin I lay in thrall,
next to the dungeon of despair,
Till mercy raised me from my fall,
and grace my ruins did repair.
Man's civil war.
MY houering thoghts would fly to heaven
and quiet nestle in the sky,
Feign would my ship in virtues shore
without remove at anchor lie:
But mounted thoughts are hailed down
with heavy poise of mortal load,
And blustering storms deny my ship
in virtues haven a sure abode.
When inward eye to heavenly sights
does draw my longing hearts desire,
The world with guesses of delights,
would to her perch my thoughts retire.
Fond fancy trains to pleasures lure,
though reason stiffely do repine.
Though reason woo me to the Saint,
yet sense would win me to the shrine:
Where wisdom loathes, there fancy loves
and over rules the captive will.
Foes senses, and to virtues lore,
they draw the wit their wish to fill.
Need craves consent of soul to sense,
yet diverse bents breeds civil fray,
Hard hap where halues must disagree,
or trust of halues the whole betray.
O cruel fight, where fighting friend
with love does kill a favoring foe.
Where peace with sense is war with God
and self delight the seed of woe,
Dame pleasures drugges are steept in sin,
their sugared taste does breed annoy.
O fickle sense beware her ginne,
sell not thy soul for brittle joy.
Seek flowers of heaven.
SO ear up my soul unto thy rest,
cast off this loathsome load:
Long is the date of thy exile,
too long the strickt abode.
Grace not on worldly withered weed,
it fitteth not thy taste;
The flowers of everlasting spring,
do grow for thy repast.
Their leaves are staind in beauties die,
and blazed with their beams;
Their stalks enameld with delight,
and limbde with glorious gleames.
Life giving juice of living love,
their sugared veins does fill,
And watered with eternal showers,
they nectard drops distill.
These flowers do spring from fertile soil,
though from vnmanur'd field,
Most glittering gold in lieu of glebe,
these fragrant flowers do yield:
Whose sovereign sent surpassing sense,
so rauisheth the mind,
That worldly weeds needs must he loath,
that can these flowers find.

LONDON. Printed for W. Barret.

To the worshipful and virtuous Gentlewoman, Mistress D.A.
YOur Virtuous requests, to which your deserts gave the force of a
commandment, won me to satisfy your devotion, in penning some little
discourse of the blessed Mary Magdalene. And among other glorious examples of
this Saints life, I have made choice of her Funeral Tears, in which as she
most uttered the great vehemency of her fervent love to Christ, so has she
given therein largest scope to dilate upon the same: a theme pleasing I hope
unto your self, and fittest for this time. For as passion, and especially this
of love, is in these days the chief commander of most men's actions, and the
Idol to which both tongues and pens do sacrifice their ill bestowed labors:
so is there nothing now more needful to be entreated, than how to direct these
humors unto their due courses, and to draw this flood of affections into the
right chanel. Passions I allow, and loves I approve, only I would wish that
men would alter their object, and better their intent. For passions being
sequels of our nature, and allotted unto us as the handmaides of reason, there
can be no doubt, but that as their author is good, and their end godly; so
their use tempered in the mean, implies no offense. Love is but the infancy
of true charity, yet sucking Natures teat, and swathed in her bands, which
then grows to perfection, when faith besides natural motives, proposes
higher and nobler grounds of amity. Hatred and anger are the necessary
officers of prowess and justice, courage being cold and dull, and Justice in
due revenge slack and careless, where hate of the fault does not make it
odious, and anger sets not an edge on the sword that punishes or preuenteth
wrongs. Desire and hope are the parents of diligence and industry, the nurses
of perseverance and constancy, the seeds of valor and magnanimity, the
death of sloth, and the breath of all virtue. Fear and dislikes are the
scoutes of discretion, the harbingers of wisdom and policy, killing idle
repentance in the cradle, and curbing rashness with deliberation. Audacitie is
the armor of strength, and the guide of glory, breaking the Ice to the
hardest exployts, and crowning valor with honorable victory.

Sorrow is the sister of mercy, and a waker of compassion, weeping with others
tears, and grieved with their harms. It is both the salve and smart of sin,
curing that which it chastises with true remorse, and preventing need of new
cure with the detestation of the disease. Despair of the success, is a bitte
against evil attempts, and the hearse of idle hopes, ending endless things in
their first motion, to begin. True joy is the rest and reward of virtue,
seasoning difficulties with delight, and giving a present assay of future
happiness. Finally, there is no passion but has a serviceable use either in
pursuit of good, or auoidance of evil, and they are all benefits of God, and
helps of nature, so long as they are kept under virtues correction.

But as too much of the best is evil, and excess in virtue, vice; so passions
let loose without limits, are imperfections, nothing being good that wants
measure. And as the sea is unfit for traffic, not only when the winds are
too boisterous, but also when they are too still, and a middle gale and motion
of the waves serves best the sailors purpose; So neither too stormy nor too
calm a mind gives Virtue the first course, but a middle temper between them
both, in which the welordered passions are wrought to prosecute, not suffered
to pervert any virtuous endeavor. Such were the passions of this holy Saint,
which were not guides to reason, but attendants upon it, and commanded by such
a love as could never exceed, because the thing loved was of infinite
perfection. And if her weakness of faith, (an infirmity then common to all
Christ's disciples) did suffer her understanding to be deceived, yet was her
will so settled in a most sincere and perfect love, that it led all her passions
with the same byas, recompencing the want of belief, with the strange effects
of an excellent charity. This love and these passions are the subject of this
discourse, which though it reach not to the dignity of Mary's deserts, yet
shall I think my endeavors well appayd, if it may but woo some skilfuller
pens from unworthy labors, either to supply in this matter my want of
ability, or in other of like piety, (whereof the Scripture is full) to
exercise their happier talents. I know that none can express a passion that he
feels not, neither does the pen deliver but what it copieth out of the
mind. And therefore the finest wits are now given to write passionate
discourses, I would wish them to make choice of such passions, as it neither
should be shame to utter, nor sin to feel.

But whether my wishes in this behalf take effect or not, I reap at the least
this reward of my pains, that I have showed my desire to answer your courtesy,
and set forth the due praises of this glorious Saint:

Your loving friend, R.S.

To the Reader.
MAny, suiting their labors to the popular vain, and guided by the gale of
vulgar breath, have diuulged diverse patheticall discourses, in which if they
had showed as much care to profit, as they have done desire to please, their
works would much more have honored their names, and auailed the Reader. But it
is a just complaint among the better sort of persons, that the finest wits lose
themselves in the vainest follies, spilling much Art in some idle fancy, and
leaving their works as witnesses how long they have been in travail, to be
in fine delivered of a fable. And sure it is a thing greatly to be lamented,
that men of so high conceit, should so much abase their habilities, that when
they have racked them to the uttermost endeavor, all the praise that they reap
of their employment, consists in this, that they have wisely told a foolish
tale, and carried a long lie very smoothly to the end. Yet this inconvenience
might find some excuse, if the drift of their discourse leuelled at any
virtuous mark. For infables are often figured moral truths, and that covertly
uttered to a common good, which without a mask would not find so free a
passage. But when the substance of the work has neither truth nor
probability; nor the purport thereof tends to any honest end, the writer is
rather to be pitied than praised, and his books fitter for the fire than for
the press. This common oversight more have observed, than endeavored to salve,
every one being able to reprove, none willing to redress such faults,
authorized especially by general custom. And though if necessity (the
lawless patron of enforced actions) had not more prevailed than choice, this
work of so different a subject from the usual vain, should have been no
eyesore to those that are pleased with worse matters. Yet since the copies
thereof flew fo fast, and so false abroad, that it was in danger to come
corrupted to the print, it seemed a less evil to let it fly to common view in
the native plume, and with the own wings, than disguised in a coat of a
bastard feather, or cast off from the fast of such a corrector, as might hapily
have perished the sound, and imped in some sick and sorry feathers of his own
fancies. It may be that courteous skill will reckon this, though course in
respect of others exquisite labors, not unfit to entertain wel-tempered
humors, both with pleasure and profit, the ground thereef being in Scripture,
and the form of enlarging it, an imitation of the ancient Doctors, in the same
and other points of like tenor. This commodity at the least it will carry with
it, that the Reader may learn to love without improofe of purity, and teach
his thoughts either to temper passion in the mean, or to give the bridle only
where the excess cannot be faulty. Let the work defend it self, and every
one pass his censure as he sees cause. Many Carps are expected when curious
eyes come a fishing. But the care is already taken, and patience wayteth at the
cable, ready to take away, when that dish is served in, and to make room for
others to set on the desired fruit.

R.S.

MARIE MAGDALENS FUNERAL TEARS.
AMongst other mourneful accidents of the passion of Christ, that love
presents it self unto my memory, with which the blessed Marie Magdalene
loving our Lord more than her self, followed him in his journey to his death,
attending upon him when his disciples fled and being more willing to dye with
him, than they to live without him. But not finding the favor to accompany him
in death, and loathing after him to remain in life, the fire of her true
affection enflamed her heart, and her enflamed heart resolved into incessant
tears, so that burning and bathing between love and grief, she led a life
ever dying and felt a death never ending. And when he by whom she lived was
dead, and she for whom he dyed enforcedly left alive, she praised the dead more
than the living: and having lost that light of her life, she desired to dwell
in darkness, and in the shadow of death, choosing Christ's Tomb for her best
home, and his coarse for her chief comfort. For Mary (as the Evangelist says)
Stood without at the Tomb weeping.

But alas how unfortunate is this woman, to whom neither life will afford a
desired farewell, nor death allow any wished welcome? She has abandoned the
living, and chosen the company of the dead; and now it seems that even the
dead have forsaken her, since the coarse she seeks is taken away from her. And
this was the cause that love induced her to stand, and sorrow enforced her to
weep. Her eye was watchful to seek whom her heart most longed to enjoy, and
her foot in a readiness to run, if her eye should chance to espy him. And
therefore she stands to be still stirring, pressed to watch every way, and
prepared to go whither any hope should call her. But she wept because she had
such occasion of standing: and that which moved her to watch, was the motive of
her tears. For as she watched to find whom she had lost, so she wept for
having lost whom she loved, her poor eyes being troubled at once with two
contrary offices, both to be clear in sight the better to seek him, and yet
cloudy with tears for missing the sight of him.

Yet was not this the entrance but the increase of her grief, not the
beginning, but the renewing of her moan. For first she mourned for the
departing of his soul out of his body, and now she lamented the taking of his
body out of the grave, being punished with two wreckes of her only welfare,
both full of misery, but the last without all comfort. The first original of
her sorrow grew, because she could not enjoy him alive: yet this sorrow had
some solace, for that she hoped to have enjoyed him dead.

But when she considered that his life was already lost, and now not so much as
his body could be found she was wholly daunted with dismay, since this
unhappiness admitted no help. She doubted lest the love of her master (the
only portion that her fortune had left her) would soon languish in her cold
breast, if it neither had his words to kindle it, nor his presence to cherish
it, nor so much as his dead ashes to rake it up. She had prepared her spices,
and provided her ointments, to pay him the last tribute of external duties.
And though Joseph and Nicodemus had already bestowed an hundredth pounds of
Mirrhe and Aloes, which was in quantity sufficient, in quality of the best, and
as well applied as art and devotion could devise: yet such was her love, that
she would have thought any quantity too little, except hers had been added;
the best in quality too mean, except hers were with it; and no diligence in
applying it enough, except her service were in it. Not that she was sharp in
censuring that which others had done, but because love made her so desirous to
do all her self, that though all had been done that she could devise, and as
well as she could wish, yet unless she were an actor it would not suffice,
since love is as eager to be uttered in effects, as it is zealous in true
affection. She came therefore now meaning to enbalme his corpse, as she had
before anointed his feet, and to preserve the relics of his body, as the
only remnant of all her bliss. And as in the spring of her felicity she had
washed his feet with her tears, bewayling unto him the death of her own
soul: so now she came in the depth of her misery, to shed them afresh for the
death of his body. But when she saw the grave open, and the body taken out,
the labor of enbalming was prevented, but the cause of her weeping increased,
and he that was wanting to her obsequies, was not wanting to her tears; and
though she found not whom to annoint, yet found she whom to lament.

And not without cause did Marie complain, finding her first anguish doubled
with a second grief, and being surcharged with two most violent sorrows in
one afflicted heart. For having settled her whole affection upon Christ, and
summed all her desires and wishes into the love of his goodness, as nothing
could equal his worthes: so was there not in the whole world, either a greater
benefit for her to enjoy than himself, or any greater damage possible than
his loss.

The murdering in his own death, the life of all lives, left a general death
in all living creatures, and his decease not only disrobed our nature of her
most royal ornaments, but impouerished the world of all highest perfections.
What marvel therefore though her vehement love to so lovely a Lord, being
after the wrecke of his life, now also deprived of his dead body, feel as
bitter pangs for his loss, as before it tasted joys in his presence, and open
as large an issue to tears of sorrow, as ever heretofore to tears of
contentment? And though tears were rather oil than water to her flame, apter
to nourish than diminish her grief: yet now being plonged in the depth of
pain, she yielded her self captive to all discomfort, carrying an overthrown
mind in a more enfeebled body, and still busy in devising, but ever doubtful
in defining what she might best do. For what could a silly woman do but weep,
that floating in a sea of cares, found neither ear to hear her, nor tongue to
direct her, nor hand to help her, nor heart to pity her in her desolate
case? True it is, that Peter and John came with her to the Tomb, and to make
trial of her report were both within it: but as they were speedy in coming,
and diligent in searching, so were they as quick to depart, and fearful of
farther seeking. And alas, what gained she by their coming, but two witnesses
of her loss, two dismayers of her hope, and two patterns of a new despair?
Love moved them to come, but their love was soon conquered, with such fear,
that it suffered them not to stay. But Mary, hoping in despair, and
perseuering in hope, stood without fear, because she now thought nothing left
that ought to be feared. For she has lost her master, to whom she was so
entirely devoted, that he was the total of her loves, the height of her hopes,
and the uttermost of her fears, and therefore besides him, she could neither
love other creature, hope for other comfort, nor fear other loss. The worst
she could fear, was the death of her body, and that she rather desired than
feared, since she had already lost the life of her soul, without which any
other life would be a death, and with which any other death would have been a
delight. But now she thought it better to dye than to live, because she might
happily dying find, whom not dying she looked not to enjoy, and not enjoying
she had little will to live. For now she loved nothing in her life, but her
love to Christ: and if any thing did make her willing to live, it was only the
unwillingness that his Image should dye with her, whose likeness love had
limited in her heart, and treasured up in her sweetest memories. And had she
not feared to break the table, and to break open the closet, to which she had
entrusted this last relic of her lost happiness, the violence of grief,
would have melted her heart into inward bleeding tears, and blotted her
remembrance with a fatal oblivion. And yet nevertheless, she is now in so
imperfect a sort alive, that it is proved true in her, that Love is as strong
as death. For what could death have done more in Mary than love did? Her wits
were astonished, and all her senses so amazed, that in the end finding she did
not know, seeing she could not discern, hearing she perceived not, and more
than all this, she was not there where she was, for she was wholly where her
master was; more where she loved than where she lived, and less in her self
than in his body, which notwithstanding, where it was she could not imagine.
For she sought, and as yet she found not, and therefore stood at the Tomb
weeping for it, being now altogether given to mourning, and driven to misery.

But o Mary, by whose counsel, upon what hope, or with what heart, could
thou stand alone, when the Disciples were departed? Thou were there once before
they came, thou turnedst again at their coming, and yet thou stayest when
they are gone. Alas that thy Lord is not in the Tomb, thine own eyes have
often seen, the Disciples hands have felt, the empty Syndon does avouch, and
cannot all this win thee to believe it? No no, thou would rather condemn
thine own eyes of error, and both their eyes and hands of deceit, yea, rather
suspect all testimonies for untrue, than not look whom thou have lost, even
there, where by no diligence he could be found. When thou think of other
places, and can not imagine any so likely as this, thou seek again in
this, and though never so often sought, it must be an haunt for hope. For when
things dearly affected are lost, loves natures is, never to be weary of
searching even the oftenest searched corners, being more willing to think that
all the senses are mistaken, than to yield that hope should quail. Yet now
since it is so evident, that he is taken away, what should move thee to remain
here where the peril is apparent, and no profit likely? Can the wit of one
(and she a woman) wholly possessed with passion, have more light to discern
danger, than two wits of two men, and both principal fauorits of the parent of
all wisdom? Or if (notwithstanding the danger) there had been just cause to
encounter it, were not two together, being both to Christ sworn champions,
each to other affected friends, and to all his enemies professed foes, more
likely to have prevailed, than one feminine heart, timorous by kind, and
already amazed with this dreadful accident?

But alas, why do I urge her with reason, whose reason is altered into love,
and that judges it folly to follow such reason, as should any way impair her
love? Her thoughts were arrested by every thread of Christ's Sindon, and she was
captive to so many prisons, as the tomb had memories of her lost master: Love
being her Iaylor in them all, and nothing able to ransom her, but the recovery
of her Lord. What marvel then though the Apostles examples drew her not away,
whom so violent a love enforced to remain, which prescribing laws both to wit
and will, is guided by no other law but it self? She could not think of any
fear, nor stand in fear of any force. Love armed her against all hazards, and
being already wounded wtih the greatest grief, she had no leisure to remember
any lesser evil. Yea she had forgotten all things, and her self among all
things, only mindful of him whom she loved above all things. And yet her
love, by reason of her loss, drowned both her mind and memory so deep in
sorrow, and so busied her wits in the conceit of his absence, that all
remembrance of his former promises, was diuerted with the throng of present
discomforts, and she seemed to have forgotten also him besides whom she
remembered nothing. For doubtless had she remembered him as she should, she
would not have now thought the tomb a fit place to seek him, neither would
she mourn for him as dead, and removed by others force, but joy in him as
revived, and risen by his own power. For he had often foretold both the manner
of his death, and the day of his Resurrection. But alas, let her heaviness
excuse her, and the vnwontednesse of the miracle plead her pardon, since dread
and amazement has dulled her senses, distempered her thoughts, discouraged her
hopes, awaked her passions, and left her no other liberty but only to weep.
She wept therefore, being only able to weep. And as she was weeping, she
stouped down and looked into the Monument, and she saw two Angels in white,
sitting one at the head, and another at the feet, where the body of Jesus had
been laid. They said unto her, Woman why weepest thou? John 20.

O Mary, thy good hap exceeds thy hope, and where thy last sorrow was bred,
thy first succor springs. Thou did seek but one, and thou have found
two. A dead body was thy errand, and thou have light upon two alive. Thy
weeping was for a man, and thy tears have obtained Angels. Suppress now thy
sadness, and refresh thy heart with this good fortune. These Angels inuit
thee to a parley, they seem to take pity of thy case, and it may be, they
have some happy tidings to tell thee. Thou have hitherto sought in vain, as
one either unseen, or unknown, or at the least unregarded, since the party
thou seek, neither tendereth thy tears, nor answers thy cries, nor
relenteth with thy lamentings. Either he does not hear, or he will not help:
he has paraduenture left to love thee, and is loath to yield thee relief, and
therefore take such comfort as thou find, since thou art not so lucky, as to
find that which thou could wish Remember what they are, where they sit,
from whence they come, and to whom they speak. They are Angels of peace,
neither sent without cause, nor seen but of favor. They sit in the tomb, to
show that they are no strangers to thy loss. They come from heaven, from
whence all happy news descends. They speak to thy self, as though they had
some special embassage to deliver unto thee. Ask them therefore of thy
master, for they are likeliest to return thee a desired answer. Thou knew
him too well, to think that hell has devoured him: thou have long sought, and
have not found him on earth, and what place so fit for him as to be in heaven?
Ask therefore of those Angels that came newly from thence, and it may be,
their report will highly please thee. Or if thou art resolved to continue thy
seeking, who can better help thee, than they that are as swift as thy thought,
as faithful as thine own heart, and as loving to thy Lord as thou thy felfe?
Take therefore thy good hap, lest it be taken away from thee, and content thee
with Angels, since thy master has given thee over.

But alas, what means this change, and how happens this strange alteration?
The time has been that fewer tears would have wrought greater effect, shorter
seeking have sooner found, and less pain have procured more pity. The time
has been that thy anointing his feet, was accepted and praised, thy washing
them with tears highly commended, and thy wiping the^ with thy hair, most
courteously construed. How then does it now fall out, that having brought thy
sweet oils to anoint his whole body, having shed as many tears, as would
have washed more than his feet, and having not only thy hair, but thy heart
ready to serve him, he is not moved with all these duties, so much as once to
afford thee his fight? Is it not he that reclaimed thee from thy wandering
courses, that dispossessed thee of thy damned Inhabitants; and from the wilds
of sin, recovered thee into the fold and family of his flock? Was not thy
house his home, his love thy life, thy self his disciple? Did not he defend
thee against the Pharisie, plead for thee against Judas, and excuse thee to
thy sister? In sum, was not he thy Patron and Protector in all thy
necessities?

O good Jesus, what has thus estranged thee from her? Thou have heretofore so
pitied her tears, that seeing them, thou could not refrain thine. In one
of her greatest agonies, for love of her that so much loved thee, thou did
recall her dead brother to life, turning her complaint into unexpected
contentment. And we know that thou do not use to alter course without cause,
nor to chastise without desert. Thou art the first that inuitest, and the last
that forsakest* never leaving but first left; and ever offering, till thou art
refused. How then has she forfeited thy favor? or with what trespass has
she earned thy ill will? That she never left to love thee, her heart will
depose, her hand will subscribe, her tongue will protest, her tears will
testify, and her seeking does assure. And alas, is her particular case so
far from example, that thou should rather alter thy nature, than she
better her Fortune, and be to her as thou art to no other? For our parts since
thy last show of liking toward her, we have found no other fault in her, but
that she was the earliest up to seek thee, readiest to anoint thee, and when
she saw that thou were removed, she forthwith did weep for thee, and presently
went for help to find thee. And whereas those two that she brought, being
less careful of thee than fearful of themselves, when they had seen what
she had said, suddenly shrunk away, behold she still stays, she still
seeks, she still weepeth. If this be a fault, we cannot deny but this she
does, and to this she persuades; yea, this she neither means to amend, nor
requesteth thee to forgive: if therefore thou reckonest this as punishable,
punished she must be, since no excuse has effect where the fact pleads
guilty. But if this import not any offense but a true affection, and be rather
a good desire than an evil desert, why art thou so hard a Judge to so soft a
creature, requiting her love with thy loss, and suspending her hopes in this
unhappiness? Are not those thy words; I love those that love me, and who
watches early for me shall find me? why then does not this woman find thee,
that was up so early to watch for thee? Why do thou not with like repay her,
that bestows upon thee her whole love, since thy word is her warrant, and thy
promise her due debt? Art thou less moved with these tears that she sheddeth
for thee her only Master, than thou were with those that she shed before thee
for her deceassed brother? Or does her love to thy servant more please thee
than her love to thy self? Our love to others must not be to them, but to thee
in them. For he loves thee so much the less, that loue^h any thing with thee.
If therefore she then deserved well for loving thee in another, she deserved
better now, for loving thee in thy self: and if indeed thou love those that
love thee, make thy word good to her that is so far in love with thee. Of thy
self thou have said, that thou art The way, the truth, and the life. If then
thou art a way easy to find and never erring, how does she miss thee? If a
life giving life and never ending, why is she ready to dye for thee? If a true
promising truth and never failing, how is she bereaved of thee? For if what thy
tongue did speak, thy truth will auerre, she will never ask more to make her
most happy. Remember that thou said to her sister, that Mary had chosen the
best part which should not be taken from her. That she chose the best part is
out of question, since she made choice of nothing but only of thee But how can
it be verified, that this part shall not be taken from her, since thou that art
this part art already taken away? If she could have kept thee, she would not
have lost thee: and had it been in her power, as it was in her will, she would
never have parted from thee: and might she now be restored to thy presence, she
would try all fortunes rather than for go thee. Since therefore she seeks
nothing but what she chose, and the loss of her choice is the only cause of
her combat, either vouchsafe thou to keep this best part that she chose in her,
or I see not how it can be true, that it shall not be taken from her. But thy
meaning happily was, that though it be taken from her eyes, yet it should never
be taken from her heart; and it may be thy inward presence supplyeth thine
outward absence: yet I can hardly think, but that if Mary had thee within her,
she could feel it, and if she felt it, she would never seek thee. Thou art
too hot a fire to be in her bosom and not to burn her, and thy light is too
great, to leave her mind in this darkness if it shined in her. In true lovers
every part is an eye, and every thought a look, and therefore so sweet an
object among so many eyes, and in so great a light, could never lie so hidden
but love would espy it. No, no, if Mary had thee, her innocent heart (never
taught to dissemble) could not make complaint the outside of a concealed
comfort, neither would she turn her thoughts to pasture in a dead man's Tomb,
if at home she might bid them to so heavenly a banquet. Her love would not have
a thought to spare, nor a minute to spend in any other action, than in enjoying
of thee, whom she knew too well, to abridge the least part of her from so high
an happiness. For her thirst of thy presence was so exceeding, and the sea of
thy joys so well able to afford her a full draught, that though every parcel
in her should take in a whole tide of thy delights, she would think them too
few to quiet her desires. Yea doubtless, if she had thee within her, she would
not envy the fortune of the richest Empress, yea she would more rejoice to be
thy Tomb in earth, than a throne in heaven, and disdain to be a Saint if she
were worthy to be but thy shrine.

But paraduenture it is now with her mind, as it was with the Apostles eyes;
and as they seeing thee walk upon the Sea took thee for a Ghost, so she seeing
thee in her heart, deemeth thee but a fancy, being yet better acquainted with
thy bodily shape than with thy spiritual power.

But o Mary, it seems too strange, that he whom thou seek, and for whom
thou weepest, should thus give thee over to these painful fits, if in thee he
did not see a cause for which he will not be seen of thee. Still thy plaint,
and stint thy weeping, for I doubt there is some trespass in thy tears, and
some sin in thy sorrow. Do thou not remember his words to thee and to
other women, when he said: Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me, but weep
for your selves and for your children? What meanest thou then to continue this
course? Does he sorbid thy tears, and will thou not forbear them? Is it no
fault to infringe his will, or is not that his will that his words do import?
The fault must be mended, ere the penance be released, and therefore either
cease to weep, or never hope to find. But I know this Logic little
pleases thee, and I might as soon win thee to forbear living as to leave
weeping.

Thou will say, that though he forbad thee to weep for him, yet he left thee
free, to weep for thy self, and since thy love has made thee one with him,
thou weepest but for thy self when thou weepest for him. But I answer thee
again, that because he is one with thee, and thy weeping for him has been
forbidden thee, thou can not weep for thy self, but his words will condemn
thee. For if thou and he are one, for which soever thou weepest it is all one,
and therefore since for him thou may not weep, forbear all weeping left it
should offend. Yea but (say thou) to bar me from weeping, is to abridge me
of liberty, and restraint of liberty is a penalty; and every penalty
supposes some offense: but an offense it is not to weep for my self, for he
would never command it, if it were not lawful to do it. The fault therefore
must be; in being one with him, that makes the weeping for my self, a weeping
also for him. And if this be a fault, I will never amend it; and let them that
think it so, do penance for it: for my part, since I have lost my mirth, I will
make much of my sorrow, and since I have no joy but in tears, I may lawfully
shed them. Neither think I his former word, a warrant against his latter deed.
And what need had he to weep upon the Cross, but for our example, which if it
were good for him to give, it cannot be evil for me to follow? No, no, it is
not my weeping that causes my loss, since a world of eyes, and a sea of
tears, could not worthily bewail the miss of such a master.

Yet, since neither thy seeking finds, nor thy weeping prevails, satisfy
thy self with the sight of Angels. Demand the cause of their coming, and the
reason of thy Lords remove, and since they first offer thee occasion of parley,
be not thou too dainty of thy discourse. It may be they can calm thy storms,
and quiet thy unrest, and therefore conceal not from them thy sore, lest thou
lose the benefit of their emplaister. But nothing can move Mary to admit
comfort or entertain any company: for to one alone, and for ever she has
vowed her self, and except it be to him, she will neither lend her ear long
to others, nor borrow others help, lest by the seeking to allay her smart, she
should lessen her love. But drawing into her mind all pensive conceits, she
museth and pineth in a consuming languor, taking comfort in nothing but in
being comfortless.

Alas, (says she) small is the light that a star can yield when the Sun is
down, and a sorry exchange to go gather the crumbs after the loss of an
heavenly repast. My eyes are not used to see by the glimse of a spark: and in
seeking the Sun it is either needless or bootlesse to borrow the light of a
candle, since either it must bewray it self with the self light, or no other
light can ever discover it. If they come to disburden me of my heaviness,
their coming will be burdensome unto me, and they will load me more while they
labor my relief. They cannot persuade me, that my master is not lost, for my
own eyes will disprove them. They can less tell me where he may be found, for
they would not be so simple to be so long from him: or if they can forbear
him, surely they do not know him, whom none can truly know, and live long
without him. All their demurres would be tedious, and discourses irksome.
Impair my love they might, but appay it they could not, to which he that first
accepted the debt is the only payment. They either want power, will, or leave
to tell me my desire, or at the first word they would have done it, since Angels
are not used to idle speeches, and to me all talk is idle that does not tell
me of my master. They know not where he is, and therefore they are come to the
place where he last was, making the Tomb their heaven, and the remembrance of
his presence the food of their felicity. Whatsoever they could tell me, if
they told me not of him, and whatsoever they could tell me of him, if they told
me not where he were, both their telling and my hearing were but a wasting of
time. I neither came to see them, nor desire to hear them. I came not to see
Angels, but him that made both me and Angels, and to whom I owe more than both
to men and Angels.

And to thee I appeal, o most loving Lord, whether my afflicted heart does not
truly defray the tribute of an undivided love. To thee I appeal, whether I
have joined any partner with thee, in the small possession of my poor self.
And I would to God I were as, privy where thy body is, as thou art, who is
only Lord and owner of my soul.

But alas sweet Jesus, where thou were thou art not, and where thou art I know
not: wretched is the case that I am in, and yet how to better it I cannot
imagine. Alas o my only desire, why have thou left me wavering in these
uncertainties, and in how wild a maze wander my doubtful and perplexed
thoughts? If I stay here where he is not, I shall never find him. If I go
further to seek, I know not whither. To leave the Tomb is a death, and to
stand helpless by it an incurable disease, so that all my comfort is now
concluded in this, that I am free to choose whether I will stay without help,
or go without hope, that is in effect, with what torment I will end my life.
And yet even this were too happy a choice for so unhappy a creature. If I might
be chuser of mine own death, o how quickly should that choice be made, and how
willingly would I run to that execution? I would be nailed to the same
cross, with the same nails, and in the same place: my heart should be wounded
with his spear, my head with his thorns, my body with his whippes: Finally, I
would taste all his torments, and tread all his embrued and bloody steps.

But o ambitious thoughts, why gaze you upon so high a felicity? why think
you of so glorious a death, that are privy to so infamous a life? Death alas I
deserve, yea not one but infinite deaths. But so sweet a death, seasoned with
so many comforts, the very instruments whereof were able to raise the deadest
corpse, and depure the most defiled soul, were too small a scourge for my great
offenses. And therefore I am left to feel so many deaths as I live hours, and
to pass as many pangs as I have thoughts of my loss, which are as many as
there are minutes, and as violent as if they were all in every one. But since I
can neither die as he died, nor live where he lies dead, I I will live out my
living death by his grave, and dye on my dying life by his sweet Tomb. Better
is it after loss of his body to look to his Sepulcher, than after the loss
of the one, to leave the other to be destroyed. No, no, though I have been
robbed of the Saint, I will at the least have care of the shrine, which though
it be spoiled of the most sovereign host, yet shall it be the Altar where I
will daily sacrifice my heart, and offer up my tears.

Here will I ever lead, yea here do I mean to end my wretched life, that I
may at the least be buried by the Tomb of my Lord, and take my iron sleep
near this couch of stone which his presence has made the place of sweetest
repose.

It may be also that this empty Syndon lies here to no use, and this Tomb
being open without any in it, may give occasion to some merciful heart, that
shall first light upon my unburied body, to wrap me in his shroud, and to
interre me in this Tomb.

O too fortunate lot, for so unfortunate a woman to crave: no: no: I do not
crave it. For alas, I dare not, yet if such an ouer-sight should be committed,
I do now beforehand, forgive that sinner, and were it no more presumption to
wish it alive, than to suffer it dead, if I knew the party that should first
pass by me, I would woo him with my tears, and hire him with my prayers, to
bless me with this felicity. And though I dare not wish any to do it, yet this
(without offense) I may say to all, that I love this Syndon above all clothes
in the world, and this Tomb I esteem more than any Princes monument: yea, and
I think that coarse highly favored, that shall succeed my Lord in it: and for
my part, as I mean that the ground where I stand shall be my deathbed; so am
I not of Jacobs mind, to have my body buried far from the place where it
dies, but even in the next and readiest grave, and that as soon as my breath
fails, since delays are bootlesse where death has won possession.

But alas, I dare not say any more, let my body take such fortune as befalls
it: my soul at the least shall dwell in this sweet Paradise, and from this
brittle case of flesh and blood, pass presently into the glorious Tomb of God
and man. It is now enwrapped in a mass of corruption, it shall then enjoy a
place of high perfection: where it is now it is more by force than by choice,
and like a repining prisoner in a loathed gaile: but there in a little room it
should find perfect rest, and in the prison of death, the liberty of a joyful
life.

O sweet Tomb of my sweetest Lord, while I live I will stay by thee, when I
die, I will cleave unto thee: neither alive nor dead, will I ever be drawn
from thee. Thou art the Altar of mercy, the temple of truth, the sanctuary of
safe^ie, the grave of death, and the cradle of eternal life. O heaven of my
eclipsed Sun, receive unto thee this silly star that has now also lost all
wished light. O Whale that have swallowed my only Jonas, swallow also me, more
worthy to be thy prey, since I, and not he, was the cause of this bloody
tempest. O Cesterne of my innocent Joseph, take me into thy dry bottom, since
I, and not he gave just cause of offense to my enraged brethren. But alas, in
what cloud have thou hidden the light of our way? Upon what shore have thou
cast up the Preacher of all truth? or to what Ismaelite have thou yielded the
purueiour of our life?

Oh unhappy me, why did I not before think of that which I now ask? Why did I
leave him when I had him, thus to lament him now that I have lost him? If I had
watched with perseverance, either none would have taken him, or they should
have taken me with him.

But through too much preciseness in keeping the Law, I have lost the
Lawmakers; and by being too scrupulous in observing his ceremonies, I am proved
irreligious in losing him self, since I should rather have remained with the
truth, than forsaken it to solemnize the figure. The Sabbath could not have
been profaned in standing by his coarse, by which the profaned things are
sanctified, and whose touch does not defile the clean, but cleanses the most
defiled.

But when it was time to stay, I departed: when it was too late to help, I
returned: and now I repent my folly, when it cannot be amended. But let my
heart dissolve into sighs, mine eyes melt in tears, and my desolate soul
languish in dislikes: yea, let all that I am and have, endure the deserved
punishment, that if he were incensed with my fault, he may be appeased with my
penance, and return upon the amendment that fled from the offense.

Thus when her timorous conscience had indicted her of so great an omission, and
her tongue enforced the evidence with these bitter accusations, Love, that was
now the only vmpire in all her causes, condemned her eyes to a fresh shower of
tears, her breast to a new storm of sighs, and her soul, to be perpetual
prisoner to restless sorrows.

But o Mary, thou deceiuest thy self in thy own desires, and it well
appears, that excess of grief, has bred in thee a defect of due
providence. And would thou indeed have thy wishes come to pass, and thy
words fulfilled? Tell me then, I pray thee, if thy heart were dissolved, where
would thou harbor thy Lord? what would thou offer him? how would thou
love him?

Thine eyes have lost him, thy hands cannot feel him, thy feet cannot follow
him: and if it be at all in thee, it is thy heart that has him, and would
thou now have that dissolved, from thence also to exile him? And if thine eyes
were melted, thy soul in langour, and thy senses decayed, how would thou
see him, if he did appear? how should thou hear him, if he did speak? how
could thou know him, though he were there present?

Thou think happily that he loved thee so well, that if thy heart were spent
for his love, he would either lend his own heart unto thee, or create a new
heart in thee, better than that which thy sorrow took from thee. It may be
thou imaginest that if thy soul would give place, his soul wanting now a
body, would enter into thine, with supply of all thy senses, and release of
thy sorrows.

O Mary, thou did not mark what thy master was wont to say, when he told
thee, that the third day he should rise again. For if thou had heard him, or
at the least understood him, thou would not think, but that he now used
both his heart and soul in the life of his own body. And therefore repair to
the Angels, and enquire more of them, lest the Lord be displeased, that coming
from him, thou will not entertain them.

But Mary, whose devotions were all fixed upon a nobler Saint, and that had so
straightly bound her thoughts to his only affection, that she rather desired to
unknow whom she knew already, than to burden her mind with the knowledge of
new acquaintance, could not make her will, long since possessed with the
highest love, stoop to the acceptance of meaner friendships. And for this,
though she did not scornefully reject, yet did she with humility refuse the
Angels company, thinking it no discourtesie to take her self from them, for to
give her self more wholly to her Lord, to whom both she and they were wholly
devoted, and ought most love and greatest duty. Sorrow also being now the only
interpreter of all that sense, delivered to her understanding, made her conster
their demand in a more doubtful than true meaning.

If (says she) they came to ease my affliction, they could not be ignorant of
the cause: and if they were not ignorant of it, they would never ask it, why
then did they say, Woman why weepest thou?

If their question did import a prohibition, the necessity of the occasion
does countermand their counsel, and fitter it were they should weep with me,
than I in not weeping obey them. If the Sun were ashamed to show his
brightness, when the father of lights was darkened with such disgrace: if the
heavens discoloring their beauties, suited themselves to their makers fortune:
if the whole frame of nature were almost dissolved to see the author of nature
so vnhaturally abused: why may not Angels, that best knew the indignity of the
case, make up a part in this lamentable consort? And especially now, that by
the loss of his body, the cause of weeping is increased, and yet the number of
mourners lessened: since the Apostles are fled, all his friends afraid, and
poor I left alone to supply the tears of all creatures? O who will give water
to my head, and a fountain of tears unto mine eyes, that I may weep day and
night, and never cease weeping? O my only Lord, thy grief was the greatest
that ever was in man, and my grief as great as ever happened to woman: for my
love has carved me no small portion of thine, thy loss has redoubled the
torment of my own, and all creatures seem to have made over to me theirs,
leaving me as the vicegerent of all their sorrow. Sorrow with me at the least o
thou Tomb, and thaw into tears you hardest stones. The time is now come, that
you are licensed to cry, and bound to recompense the silence of your Lords
Disciples, of whom he himself said to the Pharisees, that if they held their
peace, the very stones should cry for them. Now therefore since fear has
locked up their lips, and sadness made them mute, let the stones cry out
against the murd erers of my Lord, and bewray the robbers of his sacred body.
And I fear that were it well known who has taken him away, there is no stone
so stony, but should have cause to lament.

It was doubtless the spite of some malicious Pharisee or bloody Scribe, that
not contented with those torments that he suffered in life (of which every one
to any other would have been a tyrannical death) has now stolen away his dead
body, to practice upon it some savage cruelty, and to glut their pitilesse eyes
and brutish hearts with the unnatural usage of his helpless corpse. O ye
rocks and stones, if ever you must cry out, now it is high time, since the
light, the life, and the Lord of the world is thus darkened, massacred, and
outragiously misused.

Does not his tongue, whose truth is infallible, and whose word omnipotent,
commanding both winds and seas, and never disobeyed of the most sensible
creatures, promise to arm the world, and make the whole earth to fight against
the senseless persons, in defense of the just? And who more just than the Lord
of justice? who more senseless than his barbarous murderers, whose insatiable
thirst of his innocent blood, could not be staunched with their cruel
butchering him at his death, unless they proceeded further in this hellish
impiety to his dead body. Why then do not all creatures address themselves to
revenge so just a quarrel, upon so senseless wretches, left of all reason,
forsaken of humanity, and bereaved of all feeling both of God and man?

O Mary, why do thou thus torment thy self with these tragical surmises?
Do thou think that the Angels would sit still, if their master were not
well? Did they serve him after his fasting, and would they despise him after
his deceasse? Did they comfort him before he was apprehended, and would not
defend him when he was dead? If in the garden he might have had twelve. Legions
of them, is his power so quite dead with his body, that he could not now
command them? Was there an Angel found to help Daniel to his dinner, to save
Toby from the fish, yea and to defend Balaams poor beast from his masters
rage: and is the Lord of Angels of so little reckoning, that if his body stood
in need, never an Angel would defend it? Thou see two here present to honor
his Tomb, and how much more careful would they be to do homage to his person?
Believe not Mary that they would smile, if thou had such occasion to weep.
They would not so gloriously shine in white, if a black and mourning weed did
better become them, or were a fitter livery for thy master to give, or them to
wear. Yield not more to thy uncertain fear and deceived love, than to their
assured knowledge, and never erring charity. Can a material eye see more than
an heavenly spirit, or the glimmering of the twilight give better aim than
the beams of their eternal Sun? Would they (think thou) wait upon the
winding sheet, while the coarse were abused, or be here for thy comfort, if
their Lord did need their service? No, no, he was neither any thieves booty,
nor Pharisees pray; neither are the Angels so careless of him, as thy
suspicion presumes. And if their presence and demeanor cannot alter thy
conceit, look upon the clothes and they will teach thee thine error, and
clear thee of thy doubt.

Would any* thief, think thou, have been so religious, as to have stolen
the body, and left the clothes? yea, would he have been so venturous, as to
have stayed the vnshrowding of the coarse, the well ordering of the sheets, and
folding up the napkins? Thou know that the Mirrhe makes linen cleave as
fast as pitch or glue: and was a thief at so much leisure, as to dissolve the
Myrrh and unclothe the dead? what did the watch while the scales were broken,
the Tomb opened, the body unfolded, all other things ordered as now thou
see? And if all this cannot yet persuade thee, believe at the least thy own
experience. When thy master was stripped at the cross, thou know that his
only garment being congealed to his goarie back, came not off without many
parts of his skin, and doubtless would have torn off many more, if he had
been anointed with Myrrh: Look then into the sheet, whether there remain
any parcel of skin, or any one hair of his head: and since there is none to be
found, believe some better issue of thy masters absence than thy fear
suggesteth. A guilty conscience doubts want of time, and therefore
dispatcheth hastily. It is in hazard to be discovered, and therefore practices
in darkness and secrecy. It ever works in extreme fear, and therefore
has no leisure to place things orderly. But to unwrap so mangled a body, out
of Mirrhed clothes without tearing of any skin, or leaving on any Mirrhe, is
a thing either to man impossible, or not possible to be done with such speed,
without light or help, and with so good order. Assure thy self therefore,
that if either of malice, or by fraud the coarse had been removed, the linen
and myrrh should never have been left; and neither could the Angels look so
chearefully, nor the clothes lie so orderly, but to import some happier
accident than thou conceiuest. But to free thee more from fear, consider these
words of the Angels, Woman why weepest thou? For what do they signify, but as
much in effect as if they had said: Where Angels rejoice, it agrees not that a
woman should weep, and where heavenly eyes are witnesses of joy, no mortal eye
should control them with testimonies of sorrow? With more than a manly courage
thou did before my coming, arm thy feet to run among swords, thy arms
to remove huge loades, thy body to endure all Tyrants rage, and thy soul to be
sundred with violent tortures: and art thou now so much a Woman that thou can
not command thine eyes to forbear tears? If thou were a true Disciple, so
many proofs would persuade thee, but now thy incredulous humor makes thee
unworthy of that style, and we can afford thee no better title, than a Woman,
and therefore o Woman, and too much a Woman, why weepest thou?

If there were here any coarse, we might think that sorrow for the dead
enforced thy tears: but now that thou find it a place of the living, why
do thou here stand weeping for the dead?

Is our presence so discomfortable that thou should weep to behold us? or
is it the course of thy kindness with tears to entertain us? If they be
teates of love to testify thy good will, as thy love is acknowledged, so let
these signs be suppressed. If they be tears of anger to denounce thy
displeasure, they should not here have been shed where all anger was buried but
none deserved. If they be tears of sorrow and duties to the dead, they are
bestowed in vain where the dead is revived. If they be tears of joy stilled
from the flowers of thy good fortune, fewer of these would suffice, and fitter
were other tokens to express thy contentment. And therefore O Woman, why do
thou weep? would our eyes be so dry, if such eye-streames were behouefull?
Yea, would not the heavens rain tears if thy supposals were truths? Did not
Angels always in their visible semblances represent their Lords invisible
pleasures, shadowing their shapes in the drift of his intentions? When God was
incensed they brandished swords: when he was appeased, they sheathed them in
scabbards: when he would defend, they resembled soldiers, when he would
terrify they took terrible forms, and when he would comfort, they carried
mirth in their eyes, sweetness in their countenance, mildness in their words,
favor, grace and comeliness in their whole presence. Why then do thou
weep, seeing us to rejoice? Do thou imagine us to degenerate from our
nature, or to forget any duty, whose state is neither subject to change, nor
capable of the least offense? Art thou more privy to the counsel of our
eternal God, than we that are daily attendants at his throne of glory? O
woman, deem not amiss against so apparent evidence, and at our request
exchange thy sorrow for our joy.

But o glorious Angels, why do ye move her to joy, if you know why she weepeth?
Alas, she weepeth for the loss of him without whom all joy is to her but
matter of new grief. While he lived, every place where she found him, was to
her a Paradise* every season wherein he was enjoyed, a perpetual spring, every
exercise wherein he was served, a special felicity: the ground whereon he
went, seemed to yield her sweeter footing: the air wherein he breathed, became
to her spirit of life, being once sanctified in his sacred breast. In sum,
his presence brought with it an heaven of delights, and his departure seemed to
leave an eclipse in all things. And yet even the places that he had once
honored with the access of his person, were to her so many sweet Pilgrimages,
which in his absence she used as chapels and altars, to offer up her prayers,
feeling in them long after, the virtue of his former presence. And therefore to
feed her with conjectures of his well being, is but to strengthen her fear of
his evil, and the alleging of likelihoods by those that know the certainty,
imports the cause to be so lamentable, that they are unwilling it should be
known. Your obscure glancing at the truth, is no sufficient acquittance of her
grief, neither ca^ she out of these disioyned ghests spell the words that must
be the conclusion of her complaint. Tell her then directly what is become of
her Lord, if you mean to deliver her out of these dumpes, since what else
soever you say of him, does but draw more humors to her sore, and rather anger
it than any way assuage it. Yet hearken o Mary, and consider their speeches.
Think what answer thou will give them, since they press thee with so strong
persuasion. But I doubt that thy wits are smothered with too thick a mist, to
admit these unknown beams of their pale light. Thou art so wholly inherited by
the bloody tragedy of thy slaughtered Lord, and his death and dead body has
gotten so absolute a conquest over all thy powers, that neither thy sense can
discern, nor thy mind conceive any other object than his murdered coarse.

Thy eyes seem to tell thee that every thing inuiteth thee to weep, carrying
such outward show, as though all that thou see were attyred in sorrow to
solemnize with general consent the funeral of the master. Thy tears
persuade thee that all sounds and voices are tuned with mournful notes, and
that the Echo of thine own wailings, is the cry of the very stones and trees,
as though (the cause of thy tears being so unusual) God to the rocks and
woods, had inspired a feeling of thine and their common loss. And therefore it
sounds to thee as a strange question, to ask thee why thou weepest, since all
that thou see and hear, seems to induce thee, yea, to enforce thee to
weep.

If thou see any thing that bears color of mirth, it is unto thee like the
rich spoils of a vanquished kingdom, in the eye of a captive Prince, which
puts him in mind what he had, not what he has, and are but vpbraidings of his
loss, and whetstones of sharper sorrow. Whatsoever thou hear that moves
delight, it presents the miss of thy masters speeches, which as they were
the only Harmony that thy ears affected, so they being now stopped with a
deathfull silence, all other words and tunes of comfort are to thee but an
Israelites music upon Babylons bancks, memories of a lost felicity, and
proofs of a present unhappiness. And though love increases the conceit of
thy loss, which endeareth the meanest things, and doubleth the estimate of
things that are precious: yet thy faith teaching thee the infinite dignity of
thy Master, and thy understanding being no dull scholar to learn so well
liked a lesson, it fell out to be the bitterest part of thy misery, that thou
did so well know how infinite the loss was that made thee miserable.

This is the cause that those very Angels, in whom all things make remonstrance
of triumph and solace, are unto thee occasions of new grief. For their
gracious and lovely countenances, remember thee, that thou have lost the beauty
of the world, and the highest mark of true loves ambition. Their sweet looks
and amiable features tell thee, that the heaven of thy eyes which was the
reverend Majesty of thy Masters face, once shined with far more pleasing
graces, but is now disfigured with the dreadful forms of death. In sum,
they were to thee, like the glistering sparks of a broken Diamond, and like
pictures of dead and decayed beauties, signs, not salues of thy calamity,
memorials, not medicines of thy misfortune. Thy eyes were too well acquainted
with the truth, to accept a supply of shadows: and as comeliness, comfort and
glory, were never in any other so truly at home and so perfectly in their
prime, as in the person and speeches of thy Lord: so cannot thy thoughts but be
like strangers in any foreign delight. For in them all thou see no more but
some scattered crumbs, and hungry morsels of thy late plentiful banquets, and
find a dim reflection of thy former light, which like a flash of lightning,
in a close and stormy night, serves thee but to see thy present infelicitie,
and the better to know the horror of the ensuing darkness.

Thou think therefore thy self blameless, both in weeping for thy loss,
and in refusing other comfort: Yet in common courtesy afford these Angels an
answer, since their charity visiting thee, deserves much more, and thou (if
not too ungrateful) can allow them no less.

Alas (says she) what needs my answer, where the misery it self speaks,
and the loss is manifest? My eyes have answered them with tears, my breast
with sighs, and my heart with throbs, what need I also punish my tongue, or
wound my soul, with a new rehearsal of so do lefull a mischance? They have
taken away, O unfortunate word, they have taken away my Lord.

O afflicted woman; why think thou this word so unfortunate? It may be the
Angels have taken him, more solemnly to entombe him: and since earth has done
her last homage, happily the Quires of heaven are also descended to defray unto
him their funeral duties.

It may be that the Centurion and the rest, that did acknowledge him on the
cross to be the Son of God, have been touched with remorse, and goared with
prick of conscience, and being desirous to satisfy for their heinous offense,
have now taken him, more honorably to interre him, and by their service to his
body sought forgiveness, and sued the pardon of their guilty souls.

Peradventure some secret disciples, have wrought this exploit, and maugre the
watch taken him from hence, with due honor to preserve him in some better
place, and therefore being yet uncertain who has him, there is no such cause
to lament, since the greater probabilities, march on the better side. Why do
thou call sorrow before it comes, which without calling comes on thee too
fast? yea, why do thou create sorrow where it is not, since thou have true
sorrow enough, though imagined sorrows help not? It is folly to suppose the
worst where the best may be hoped for: and every mishap brings grief enough
with it, though we with our fears do not go first to meet it. Quiet then thy
self till time try out the truth, and it may be thy fear will prove greater
than thy misfortune.

But I know thy love is little helped with this lesson: for the more it loves,
the more it fears: and the more desirous to enjoy, the more doubtful it is
to lose. It neither has measure in hopes, nor mean in fears: hoping the best
upon the least surmises, and fearing the worst upon the weakest grounds. And
yet both fearing and hoping at one time, neither fear withholds hope from
the highest attempts nor hope can strengthen fear against the smallest
suspicions: but maugre all fears, loves hopes will mount to the highest pitch,
and maugre all hopes, loves fears will stoop to the lowest downe-come. To bid
thee therefore hope, is not to forbid thee to fear, and though it may be for
the best, that thy Lord is taken from thee, yet since it may also be for the
worst, that will never content thee.

Thou think, hope does enough to keep thy heart from breaking, and fear
little enough to force thee to no more than weeping, since it is as likely that
he has been taken away upon hatred by his enemies, as upon love by his friends.

For hitherto (say thou) his friends have all failed him, and his foes
prevailed against him; and as they would not defend him alive, are less likely
to regard him dead, so they that thought one life too little to take from him,
are not unlikely after death to wrecke new rage upon him.

And though this doubt were not, yet whosoever has taken him, has wronged me,
in not acquainting me with it: for to take away mine without my consent, can
neither be offered with out injury, nor suffered without sorrow. And as for
Jesus, he was my Jesus, my Lord, and my Master. He was mine because he was
given unto me, and borne for me: he was the author of my being, and so my
father; he was the worker of my well doing, and therefore my Savior; he was
the price of my ransom, and thereby my Redeemer: he was my Lord to command me,
my master to instruct me, my pastor to feed me. He was mine, because his love
was mine, and when he gave me his love, he gave me himself, since love is no
gift except the giver be given with it, yea it is no love, unless it be as
liberal of that it is, as of that it has. Finally, if the meat be mine that
I eat, the life mine wherewith I live, or he mine, all whose life, labors,
and death were mine, then dare I boldly say that Jesus is mine, since on his
body I feed, by his love I live, and to my good without any need of his own,
has he lived, labored, and dyed. And therefore though his Disciples, though
the Centurion, yea though the Angels have taken him, they have done me wrong,
in defeating me of my right, since I never mean to resign my interest.

But what if he has taken away himself, will thou also lay injustice to his
charge? Though he be thine, yet thine to command, not to obey; thy Lord to
dispose of thee, and not to be by thee disposed: and therefore, as it is no
reason that the servant should be master of his masters secrets, so might he,
and peradventure so has he, removed without acquainting thee whither, reviving
himself with the same power with which he raised thy dead brother, and
fulfilling the words that he often uttered of his resurrection. It may be thou will say, that a gift once given, cannot be revoked, and therefore though it
were before in his choice, not to give himself unto thee, yet the deed of gift
being once made, he cannot be taken from thee, neither can the donor dispose of
his gift without the possessors priuity. And since this is a rule in the law of
nature, thou may imagine it a breach of equine, and an impeachment of thy
right, to convey himself away without thy consent.

But to this I will answer thee with thine own ground. For if he be thine by
being given thee once: thou art his by as many gifts, as days, and therefore
he being absolute owner of thee, is likewise full owner of whatsoever is thine:
and consequently because he is thine, he is also his own, and so nothing
liable unto thee, for taking him self from thee.

Yea, but he is my Lord (say thou) and in this respect, bound to keep me,
at the least bound not to kill me: and since killing is nothing but a seu^ring
of life from the body, he being the chief life both of my soul and body,
cannot possibly go from me, but he must with a double death kill me. And
therefore he being my Lord, and bound to protect his servant, it is against all
laws that I should be thus forsaken.

But o cruel tongue, why pleadest thou thus against him, whose case I fear me
is so pitiful, that it might rather move all tongues to plead for him, being
peradventure in their hands, whose vumercifull hearts make themselves merry
with his misery, and build the triumphs of their impious victory upon the
doleful ruins of his disgraced glory? And now (o grief) because I know not
where he is. I cannot imagine how to help, for they have taken him away, and I
know not where they have put him.

Alas Mary, why do thou consume thy felfe with these cares? His father
knows, and he will help him. The Angels know, and they will guard him. His
own soul knows, and that will assist him. And what need then is there,
that thou silly woman should know it, that can no way profit him? But I
feel in what vain thy pulse beats, and by thy desire I discover thy
disease. Though both heaven and earth did know it, and the whole world had
notice of it, yet except thou also were made privy vnro it, thy woes would be
as great, and thy tears as many. That others see the Sun, does not lighten
thy darkness, neither can others eating satisfy thy hunger. The more there be
that know of him, the greater is thy sorrow, that among so many thou art not
thought worthy to be one. And the more there be that may help him, the move it
grieueth thee that thy poor help is not accepted among them. Though thy
knowiedge needs not, thy love does desire it, and though it avail not, thy
desire will seek it. If all know it, thou would know it with all: if no
other, thou would know it alone, and from whom soever it be concealed, it
must be no secret to thee. Though the knowledge would discomfort thee, yet know
it thou will, yea though it would kill thee, thou could not forbear it.

Thy Lord to thy love is like drink to the thirsty, which if they cannot
have, they die for drouth, being long without it they pine away with longing.
And as men in extremity of thirst are still dreaming of fountains, brooks,
and springs, being never able to have other thought, or to utter other word but
of drink and moisture: so lovers in the vehemency of their passion, can
neither think nor speak but of that they love, and if that be once missing,
every part is both an eye to watch, and an ear to listen, what hope or news
may be had. If it be good, they die till they hear it, though bad yet they
cannot live without it. Of the good, they hope that it is the very best; and of
the evil, they fear it to be the worst: and yet though never so good they
pine till it be told, and be it never so evil, they are importunate to know
it. And when they once know it, they can neither bear the joy nor brook the
sorrow, but as well the one as the other is enough to kill them.

And this, o Mary, I guess to be the cause why the Angels would not tell thee
thy Lords estate. For if it had been to thy liking, thou would have died
for joy, if otherwise thou would have sunk down for sorrow. And therefore
they leave this news for him to deliver, whose word if it give thee a wound,
is also a salve to cure it, though never so deadly.

But alas afflicted soul, why does it so deeply grieve thee, that thou
know not where he is? Thou can not better him if he be well, thou can as
little succor him if he be ill: and since thou fear that he is rather ill
than well, why should thou know it, so to end thy hopes in mishap, and thy
great fears in far greater sorrows? Alas, to ask thee why, is in a manner
to ask one half starued why he is hungry. For as thy Lord is the food of thy
thoughts, the relief of thy wishes, the only repast of all thy desires: so is
thy love a continual hunger, and his absence unto thee an extreme famine. And
therefore no marvel though thou art so greedy to hear, yea to devour any, be
it never so bitter notice of him, since thy hunger is most violent, and nothing
but he able to content it. And albeit the hearing of his harms should work
the same in thy mind, that unwholesome meat works in a sick stomach: yet if
it once concern him that thou love, thy hungry love could not temper it
self from it, though after with many wringing gripes, it did a long and
unpleasant penance.

But why does thy sorrow quest so much upon the place where he is? were it not
enough for thee to know who had him, but that thou must also know in what place
he is bestowed? A worse place than a grave no man will offer, and many far
better many titles will allow: and therefore thou may boldly think, that
wheresoever he be, he is in a place fitter for him than where he was. Thy
sister Martha confessed him to be the Son of God, and with her confession
agreed thy belief. And what place more convenient for the son, than to be
with his Father, the business for which he has been so long from him, being
now fully finished? If he be the Messiah, as thou did once believe, it was
said of him, That he should ascend on high, and lead our captivity captive.
And what is this height, but heaven? what our captivity but death? Death
therefore is become his captive, and it is like that with the spoils thereof,
he is ascended in triumph to eternal life.

But if thou can not lift thy mind to so favorable a belief, yet may
thou very well suppose that he is in Paradise. For if he came to repair Adams
ruins, and to be the common parent of our redemption, as Adam was of our
original infection: reason seems to require, that having endured all his
life the penalty of Adams exile, he should after death re-enter possession of
that inheritance which Adam lost: that the same place that was the neast where
sin was first hatched, may be now the childbed of grace and mercy. And if
sorrow at the cross did not make thee as deaf, as at the Tomb it makes thee
forgetful, thou did in confirmation hereof hear himself say to one of
the thieves, that the same day he should be with him in Paradise. And if it be
reason that no shadow should be more privileged than the body, no figure in
more account than the figured truth, why should thou believe that Elias and
Enoch have been in Paradise these many ages, and that he who^ they but as tipes
resembled, should be excluded from thence? He excelled them in life, surpassed
them in miracles, he was far beyond them in dignity: why then should not his
place be far above, or at the least equal with theirs, since their
prerogatives were so far inferior unto his?

And yet if the baseness and misery of his passion have laid him so low in thy
conceit, that thou think Paradise too high a place to be likely to have him:
the very lowest room that any reason can assign him, cannot be meaner than
the bosom of Abraham. And since God in his life did so often acknowledge him
for his Son, it seems the slenderest pre-eminence that he can give him
above other men, that being his holy one, he should not in his body see
corruption, but be free among the dead, reposing both in body and soul, where
other Saints are in soul only. Let not therefore the place where he is
trouble thee, since it cannot be worse than his grave, and infinite conjectures
make probability that it cannot but be better.

But suppose that he were yet remaining on earth, and taken by others out of
his Tomb, what would it avail thee to know where he were? If he be with such
as love and honor him, they will be as wary to keep him, as they are loath he
should be lost: and therefore will either often change, or never confess the
place, knowing secrecy to be the surest lock to defend so great a treasure.
If those have taken him, that malice and malign him, thou may well judge him
past thy recovery, when he is once in possession of so cruel owners.

Thou would happily make sale of thy living, and seek him by ransom. But it
is not likely they would sell him to be honored, that bought him to be
murdered.

If price would not serve, thou would fall to prayer. But how can prayer
soften such flinty hearts? And if they scorned so many tears offered for his
life, as little will they regard thy entreaty for his coarse.

If neither price nor prayer would prevail, thou would attempt it by force.
But alas silly soldier, thy arms are too weak to manage weapons, and the
issue of thy affault, would be the loss of thy self.

If no other way would help, thou would purloine him by stealth, and think
thy self happy in contriuing such a theft. O Mary, thou art deceived, for
malice will have many locks: and to steal him from a thief, that could steal
him from the watch, requires more cunning in the Art, than thy want of
practice can afford thee.

Yet if these be the causes that thou enquired of the place, thou show the
force of thy rare affection, and deseruest the Laurel of a perfect lover.

But to feel more of their sweetness, I will poune these spices, and dwell a
while in the peruse of thy resolute seruour.

And first, can thy love enrich thee when thy goods are gone, or a dead coarse
repay the value of thy ransom? Because he had neither bed to be borne in, nor
grave to be buried in, will thou therefore rather be poor with him, than rich
without him?

Again, if thou had to sue to some cruel Scribe or Pharisie, that is, to an
heart boiling in rancor, with an heart burning in love, for a thing of him
above all things detested, of thee above all things desired: as his enemy to
whom thou suest, and his friend for whom thou intrearest: can thou think it
possible for this suit to speed? Could thy love repair thee from his rage, or
such a tyrant stoop to a woman's tears?

Thirdly, if thy Lord might be recovered by violence, art thou so armed in
complete love, that thou think it sufficient harness? or does thy love
indue thee with such a Iudiths spirit, or lend thee such Sampsons locks, that
thou can break open huge gates, or foil whole armies? Is thy love so sure a
shield, that no blow can break it, or so sharp a dint, that no force can
withstand it? Can it thus alter sex, change nature, and exceed all Art?

But of all other courses would thou adventure a theft to obtain thy
desire? A good deed must be well done, and a work of mercy without breach of
justice. It were a sin to steal profane treasure, but to steal an
anointed Prophet, can be no less than sacrilege. And what greater stain to
thy Lord, to his doctrine, and to thy self, than to see thee his Disciple
publicly executed for an open theft?

O Mary, unless thy love have better warrant than common sense, I can hardly
see how such designements can be approved.

Approved (says she,) I would to God the execution were as easy as the
proof, and I should not long bewail my unfortunate loss.

To others it seems ill to prefer love before riches, but to love it
seems worse to prefer any thing before it self. Cloth him with plates of
silver that shiuereth for cold, or fill his purse with treasure that pineth
with hunger, and see whether the plates will warm him, or the treasure feed
him. No, no, he will give us all his plates for a woollen garment, and all his
money for a meals meat. Every supply fitteth not with every need, and the
love of so sweet a Lord has no correspondence in worldly wealth. Without him
I were poor, though Empress of the world. With him I were rich though I had
nothing else. They that have most are accounted richest and they thought to
have most, that have all they desire: and therefore as in him alone is the
uttermost of my desires, so he alone is the sum of all my substance. It were
too happy an exchange, to have God for goods, and too rich a poverty to enjoy
the only treasure of the world. If I were so fortunate a beggar, I would
disdain Salomons wealth, and my love being so highly enriched, my life should
never complain of want.

And if all I am worth would not reach to his ransom, what should hinder to
seek him by entreaty? Though I were to sue to the gaeatest Tyrant, yet the
equity of my suit is more than half a grant. If many drops soften the
hardest stones, why should not many tears supple the most stony hearts? What
anger so fiery that may not be quenched with eye-water; since a weeping
suppliant ^ebateth the edge of more than a Lions fury? My suit it self would
sue for me, and so doleful a coarse would quicken pity in the most iron
hearts. But suppose that by touching a ranckled sore, my touch should anger it,
and my petition at the first incense him that heard it: he would percase revile
me in words, and the^ his own injury would recoyle with remorse, and be unto
me a patron to proceed in my request. And if he should accompany his words
with blows, and his blows with wounds, it may be my stripes would smart in
his guilty mind, and his conscience bleed in my bleeding wounds, and my
innocent blood so entender his Adamant heart, that his own inward feelings
would plead my cause, and peradventure obtain my suit.

But if through extremity of spite he should happen to kill me, his offense
might easily redound to my felicity. For he would be as careful to hide whom
he had unjustly murdered, as him whom he had felloniously stolen: and so it
is like that he would hide me in the same place where he had laid my Lord. And
as he hated us both for one cause, him for challenging, and me for
acknowledging that he was the Messiah: so would he use us both after one
manner. And thus what comfort my body wanted, my soul should enjoy, in seeing
a part of my self partner of my Masters misery: with whom to be miserable, I
reckon an higher fortune, than without him to be most happy.

And if no other mean would serve to recover him but force, I see no reason
why it might not very well become me. None will bar me from defending my
life, which the least worm in the right nature has leave to preserve. And
since he is to me so dear a life, that without him all life is death, nature
authoriseth my feeble forces, to employ their uttermost in so necessary an
attempt. Necessity adds ability, and love doubleth necessity, and it often
happens that nature armed with love, and pressed with need, exceeds it
self in might, and surmounteth all hope in success. And as the equity of the
cause does breath courage into the defenders, making them the mote willing to
fight, and the less unwilling to dye so guilty consciences are ever timorous,
still starting with sudden frightts, and afraid of their own suspicions, ready
to yield before the assault, upon distress of their cause, and despair of
their defense. Since therefore to rescue an innocent, to recover a right, and to
redress so deep a wrong, is so just a quarrel: nature will enable me, love
encourage me, grace confirm me, and the judge of all justice fight in my
behalf.

And if it seem unfitting to my sex in talk, much more in practice to deal
with material affairs: yet when such a cause happens as never had pattern,
such effects must follow as are without example. There was never any body of a
God but one, neither such a body stolen but now, never such a stealth
unrevenged but this. Since therefore the Angels neglect it; and men forge^, O
Judith lend me thy prowess, for I am bound to regard it.

But suppose that my force were unable to win him by an open enterprise, what
scruple should keep me from seeking him by secret means? yea and by plain
stealth, it will be thought a sin, and condemned for a theft. O sweet sin,
why was not I the first that did commit thee? Why did I suffer any other sinner
to prevent me? For stealing from God his honor I was called a sinner, and
under that title was spread my infamy. But for stealing God from a false
owner, I was not worthy to be called a sinner, because it had been too high a
glory. If this be so great a sinne^, and so heinous a theft, let others make
choice of what titles they will, but for my part I would refuse to be an
Angel, I would not wish to be a Saint, I would never be esteemed either just
or true, and I should be best contented if I might but live and die such a
sinner, and be condemned for such a theft. When I heard my Lord make so
comfortable a promise to the thief upon the Cross, that he should that day be
with him in Paradise, I had half an envy at that thieves good fortune, and
wished my self in the theefes place, so I might have enjoyed the fruit of his
promise. But if I could be so happy a thief, as to commit this theft, if that
wish had taken effect, I would now vnwish it again, and scorn to be any other
thief than my self, since my booty could make me happier than any other
theefes felicity. And what though my fellonie should be called in question, in
what respect should I need to fear? They would say, that I loved him too well;
but that were soon disproued, since where the worthiness is infinite, no love
can be enough. They would object that I stole another goods: and as for that,
many sure titles of my interest would auerre him to be mine, and his dead
coarse would rather speak than witnesses should fail to depose so certain a
truth. And if I had not a special right unto him, what should move me to
venture my life for him? No no, if I were so happy a fellon, I should fear no
temporal arraignment: I should rather fear that the Angels would cite me to
my answer; for preventing them in the theft, since not the highest Seraphin in
heaven, but would deem it a higher style than his own, to be the thief that
had committed so glorious a robbery.

But alas, thus stand I now devising what I would do, if I knew any thing of
him, and in the mean time I neither know who has him, nor where they have
bestowed him, and still I am forced to dwell in this answer, that they have
taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have put him.

While Mary thus lost her self in a Labyrinth of doubts, watering her words
with tears, and warming them with sighs, seeing the Angels with a kind of
reverence rise, as though they had done honor to one behind her: She turned
back, and she saw Jesus standing, but that it was Jesus she knew not.

O Mary, is it possible that thou have forgotten Jesus? Faith has written him
in thy understanding, love in thy will, both fear and hope in thy memory: and
how can all these Registers be so cancelled, that so plainly seeing, thou
should not know the contents? For him only thou tirest thy feet, thou
bendest thy knees, thou wringest thy hands. For him thy heart throbbeth, thy
breast sigheth, thy tongue complains. For him thine eye weepeth, thy thought
sorroweth, thy whole body faints, and thy soul languisheth. In sum, there
is no part in thee, but is busy about him, and notwithstanding all this, have
thou now forgotten him? His countenance avouches it, his voice assures it,
his wounds witness it, thine own eyes behold it, and do thou not yet
believe that this is Jesus? Are thy sharp seeing eyes become so weak sighted,
that they are dazeled with the Sun, and blinded with the light?

But there is such a shower of tears between thee and him, and thine eyes are
so dimmed with weeping for him, that though thou see the shape of a man, yet
thou can not discern him. Thy ears also are still so possessed with the
doleful Echo of his last speeches, which want of breath made him utter in a
dying voice, that the force and loudness of his living words, makes thee
imagine it the voice of a stranger: and therefore as he seems unto thee so
like a stranger, he asks this question of thee, O woman why weepest thou,
whom seek thou?

O desire of the heart, and only joy of her soul, why demandest thou why she
weepeth, or for whom she seeks? But a while since she saw thee her only hope
hanging on a tree, with thy head full of thorns, thy eyes full of tears, thy
ears full of blasphemies, thy mouth full of gall thy whole person mangled and
disfigured, and do thou ask her why she weepeth? Scarce three days passed,
she beheld thy arms and legs racked with violent pulls, thy hands and feet
boared with nails, thy side wounded with a spear, thy whole body torn with
stripes, and goared in blood, and do thou her only grief, ask her why she
weepeth? She beheld thee upon the Cross with many tears, and most lamentable
cries, yielding up her ghost, that is, thy own ghost, and alas asks thou why
she weepeth? And now to make up her misery, having but one hope alive, which
was, that for a small relief of her other afflictions, she might have
anointed thy body; that hope is also dead, since thy body is removed and she
now stands hopeless of all help, and demandest thou why she weepeth* and
for whom she seeks? Full well thou know, that thee only she desires,
thee only she loves, all things beside thee she cont^mneth, and can thou
find in thy heart to ask her whom she seeks? To what end o sweet Lord,
do thou thus suspend her longings, prolong her desires, and martyr her with
these tedious delays? Thou only art the fortress of her faint faith, the
anchor of her wavering hope, the very center of her vehement love: to thee she
trusts, upon thee she relyeth, and of her self she wholly despaireth. She is
so earnest in seeking thee that she can neither seek nor think any other
thing: and all her wits are so busied in musing upon thee, that they draw all
attention from her senses, wherewith they should discern thee. Being therefore
so attentive to that she thinks, what marvel though she mark not whom she
sees: and since thou have so perfect notice of her thought and she so little
power to discover thee by sense, why demandest thou for whom she seeks, or
why she weepeth? Do thou look that she should answer, for thee I seek, or
for thee I weep? unless thou will unbend her thoughts, that her eyes may
fully see thee: or while thou will be concealed, do thou expect that she
should be able to know thee?

But, o Mary, not without cause does he ask thee this question. Thou would
have him alive, and yet thou weepest because thou do not find him dead. Thou
art some that he is not here, and for this very cause thou should rather be
glad. For if he were dead I it is most likely he should be here; but not being
here, it is a sign that he is alive. He rejoices to be out of his grave, and
thou weepest because he is not in it. He will not lie any where, and thou
sorrowest for not knowing where he lies. Alas, why be wailest thou his glory,
and iniurest the reviving of his body as the robbery of his coarse? He being
alive, for what dead man mournest thou, and he being present, whose absence
do thou lament? But she taking him to be a Gardener said unto him, O Lord,
if thou have carried him from hence, tell me where thou have laid him, and I
will take him away.

O wonderful effects of Mary's love, if love be a languor, how lives she by
it? If love be her life, how dies she in it? If it bereaved her of sense, how
did she see the Angels? If it quickened her of sense, why knew she not Jesus?
Do thou seek for one, whom when thou have found thou know not? or if
thou do know him when thou find him, why do thou seek when thou have
him?

Behold Jesus is come, and the party whom thou seek, is he that talks
with thee, o Mary call up thy wits, and open thine eyes. Has thy Lord lived so
long labored so much died with such pain, and shed such showers of blood, to
come to no higher preferment, than to be a Gardener? And have thou bestowed
such cost, so much sorrow, and so many tears, for no better man than a silly
Gardener? Alas, is the sorry Garden the best inheritance that thy love can
afford him, or a Gardeners office the highest dignity that thou will allow
him? It had been better he had lived to have been Lord of thy Castle, than with
his death so dearly to have bought so small a purchase. But thy mistaking,
has in it a further mystery. Thou think not amiss, though thy sight be
deceived. For as our first Father, in the state of grace and innocence, was
placed in the Garden of pleasure, and the first office allotted him was to be a
Gardener: so the first man that ever was in glory, appears first in a
Garden, and presents himself in a Gardeners likeness, that the beginnings
of glory might resemble the entrance of innocence and grace. And as the
Gardener was the fall of mankind, the parent of sin, and author of death,
so is this Gardener the raiser of our ruins, the ransom of our offenses; and
the restorer of life. In a Garden Adam was deceived and taken captive by the
devil. In a Garden Christ was betrayed and taken prisoner by the Jews. In a
Garden Adam was condemned to earne his bread with the sweat of his brows. And
after a free gift of the bread of Angels in the last Supper, in a Garden Chrid
did earne it us with a bloody sweat of his whole body. By disobedient eating
the fruit of a tree, our right to that Garden was by Adam forfeited, and by
the obedient death of Christ upon a tree a far better right is now recovered.
When Adam had sinned in the Garden of pleasure, he was there apparelled in dead
beasts skins, that his garment might betoken his grave, and his livery of
death agree with his condemnation to die. And now to defray the debt of that
sin, in this Garden Christ lay cl^d in the dead man's shroud, and buried in
his Tomb, that as our harms began, so they might end; and such places and
means as were the premises to our misery; might be also the conclusions of
our misfortune. For this did Christ in the Canticles, inuit us to an heavenly
banquet after he was come into this Garden, and had reaped his myrrh, and his
spice, to forewarne us of the joy that after this harvest should presently
ensue, namely when having sowed in this Garden a body, the mortality whereof
was signified by those spices, he now reaped the same, neither capable of
death, nor subject to corruption. For this also was Mary permitted to mistake,
that we might be informed of the mystery, and see how aptly the course of our
redemption did answer the process of our condemnation.

But though he be the Gardener that has planted the tree of grace, and
restored us to the use and eating of the fruits of life. Though it be he that
sows his gifts in our souls, quickening in us the seeds of virtue, and
rooting out of us the weeds of sin: yet is he nevertheless the same Jesus
he was, and the borrowed presence of a mean laborer neither alters his
person, nor diminishes his right to his divine titles.

Why then can thou not as well see what in truth he is, as what in show he
seems? but because thou see more than thou did believe, and find
more thrn thy faith serves thee to seek: and for this though thy love was
worthy to see him, yet thy faith was unworthy to know him.

Thou did seek for him as dead, and therefore do not know him seeing
him alive; and because thou beleeuest not of him as he is, thou do only see
him as he seems to be.

I cannot say thou art faultlesse, since thou art so lame in thy belief* but
thy fault deserves favor, because thy charity is so great: and therefore o
merciful Jesus, give me leave to excuse whom thou art minded to forgive.

She thought to have found thee as she left thee, and she sought thee as she
did last see thee, being so overcome with sorrow for thy death, that she had
neither room nor respite in her mind for any hope of thy life: and being so
deeply interred in the grief of thy burial that she could not raise her
thoughts to any conceit of thy resurrection.

For in the grave where Joseph buried thy body, Mary together with it entombed
her soul, and so straightly combined it with thy coarse, that she could with
more ease sunder her soul from her own body that lives by it, than from thy
dead body, with which her love did bury it: for it is more thine and in thee,
than her own or in her self; and therefore in seeking thy body, she seeks
her own soul, as with the loss of the one, she also lost the other. What
marvel then though sense fail, when the soul is lost, since the lantern must
needs be dark when the light is out?

Restore unto her therefore her soul that lies imprisoned in thy body, and she
will soon both recover her sense, and discover her error. For alas it is no
error yt proceeds of any will to err, and it rises as much of vehemency
or affection, as of default in faith. Regard not the error of a woman, but the
love of a Disciple, which supplyeth in it self what in faith it wants. O
Lord (says she) If thou have carried him hence, tell me where thou have laid
him, and I will take him away.

O how learned is her ignorance, and how skillful her error? She charged not
the Angels with thy removing, nor seemed to mistrust them for carrying thee
away, as though that her love had taught her yt their help was needless,
where the thing removed was remouer of it self. She did not request them to
inform her where thou were laid, as if she had reserved that question for thy
self to answer. But now he judges thee so likely to be the author of her
loss, that half supposing thee guilty, she sueth a recovery, and desires
thee to tell her where the body is, as almost fully persuaded that thou art as
privy to the place, as well acquainted with the action. So that if she be not
altogether right, she is not very much wrong, and she erreth with such aim,
that she very little misseth the truth. Tell her therefore o Lord, what thou
have done with thy self, since it is fittest for thy own speech to utter that
which was only possible for thy own power to perform.

But o Mary, since thou art so desirous to know where thy Jesus is, why do
thou not name him when thou ask for him? Thou saidest to the Angels that
they had taken away thy Lord, and now the second time thou ask for him. Are
thy thoughts so visible, as at thy only presence to be seen; or so general,
that they possess all when they are once in thee? When thou speak of him,
what him do thou mean, or how can a stranger understand thee when thou
talkest of thy Lord? Has the world no other Lords but thine? or is the
demanding by no other name but (him) a sufficient notice for whom thou
demandest?

But such is the nature of thy love, thou iudgest that no other should be
entitled a Lord, since the whole world is too little for thy Lords possession,
and that those few creatures that are, cannot choose but know him, since all the
creatures of the world are too few to serve him. And as his worthiness can
appay all loves, and his only love content all hearts, so thou deemest him to
be so well worthy to be owner of all thoughts, that no thought in thy conceit,
can be well bestowed upon any other.

Yet thy speeches seem more sudden than sound, and more peremptory, than well
pondered. Why do thou say so resolutely without any further circumstance,
that if this Gardener have taken him, thou will take him from him? If he had
him by right, in taking him away thou should do him wrong. If thou supposest
he wrongfully took him, thou layest theft to his charge: and howsoever it be
thou either condemnest thy self for an usurper, or him for a thief. And is
this an effect of thy zealous love, first to abase him from a God to a
Gardener, and now to degrade him from a Gardener to a thief?

Thou should also have considered whether he took him upon love or malice.
If it were for love, thou may assure thy self that he will be as wary to
keep, as he was venturous to get him, and therefore thy policy was weak in
saying, thou would take him away before thou knew where he was, since none
is so simple to bewray their treasure to a known thief. If he took him of
malice, thy offer to recover him is an open defiance, since malice is as
obstinate in defending as violent in offering wrong, and he that would be
cruel against thy masters dead body, is likely to be more furious against his
living Disciples.

But thy love had no leisure to cast so many doubts. Thy tears were
Interpreters of thy words, and thy innocent meaning was written in thy doleful
countenance. Thine eyes were rather pleaders for pity than Heralds of wrath,
and thy whole person presented such a pattern of thy extreme anguish, that no
man from thy presence could take in any other impression. And therefore what
thy words wanted, thy action supplied, and what his ear might mistake his eye
did understand.

It might be also that what he wrought in thy heart, was concealed from thy
sight, and happily his voice and demeanor did import such compassion of thy
case, that he seemed as willing to afford as thou desire to have his help.
And so presuming by his behavior, that thy suite should not suffer repulse,
the tenor of thy request does but argue thy hope of a grant.

But what is the reason that in all thy speeches, which since the miss of thy
master thou have uttered, (where they have put him) is always a part? So thou
saydest to the Apostles, the same to the Angels, and now thou do repeat it
to this supposed Garderner: very sweet must this word be in thy heart, that is
so often in thy mouth, and it would neuet be so ready in thy tongue, if it were
not very fresh in thy memory.

But what marvel though it taste so sweet, that was first seasoned in thy
masters mouth? which as it was the treasury of truth, the fountain of life,
and the only quire of the most perfect Harmony, so whatsoever it delivered,
thine ear devoured, and thy heart locked up. And now that thou want
himself, thou have no other comfort but his words, which thou deemest so much
the more effectual to persuade, in that they took their force from so
heavenly a speaker. His sweetness therefore it is that makes this word so
sweet, and for love of him thou repeatest it so often, because he in the like
case said of thy brother, Where have you put him? O how much do thou affect
his person, that find so sweet a feeling in his phrase! How much desire
thou to see his countenance, that with so great desire pronouncest his words?
And how willingly would thou lick his sacred feet, that so willingly
vtterest his shortest speeches?

But what meanest thou to make so absolute a promise, and so boldly to say, I
will take him away? Joseph was afraid, and durst not take down his body from
the Cross but by night, yea and then also not without Pilats warrant, but thou
neither stayest until night, nor regardest Pilate, but stoutly promisest that
thou thy self wilt take him away.

What if he be in the palace of the high Priest, and some such maid as made
Saint Peter deny his master do begin to question with thee, will thou then
stand to these words, I will take him away? Is thy courage so high above kind,
thy strength so far beyond thy sex, and thy love so much without measure, yt
thou neither do remember that all women are weak, not that thy self art
but a woman? Thou exemptest no place, thou preferrest no person, thou speak
without fear, thou promisest without condition, thou make no exception: as
though nothing were impossible that thy love suggesteth.

But as the darkness could not fright thee from setting forth before day, nor
the watch fear thee from coming to the Tomb: as thou did resolve to
break open the seals though with danger of thy life, and to remove the stone
from the graves mouth, though thy force could not serve thee: so what marvel
though thy love being now more incensed with the fresh wound of thy loss, it
resolve upon any though never so hard adventures?

Love is not ruled with reason, but with love. It neither regards what can
be, nor what shall be done, but only what it self desires to do. No
difficulty can stay it, no impossibility appall it. Love is title just enough
and Armor strong enough for all assaults, and it self a reward of all
labors. It asks no recompense, it respects no commodity. Loves fruits
are loves effects, and the gains the pains. It considers behoof more than
benefit, and what in duty it should, not what indeed it can.

But how can nature be so maistered with affection, that thou can take such
delight and carry such love to a dead coarse? The mother how tenderly soever
she loved her child alive, yet she cannot choose but loath him dead. The most
loving Spouse cannot endure the presence of her deceassed husband, and whose
embracements were delightsome in life, are ever most hateful after death. Yea
this is the nature of all, but principally of women, that the very conceit,
much more the sight of the departed strikes into them so fearful and ugly
impressions, and stirs in them so great horror, that notwithstanding the
most vehement love, they think long until the house is rid of their very
dearest friends, when they are once attyred in deaths unlovely liueries. How
then can thou endure to take up his coarse in thy hands, and to carry it thou
know not thy self how far, being especially torn and mangled, and
consequently the more likely in so long time to be tainted?

Thy sister was unwilling that the grave of her own brother should be opened,
and yet he was shrouded in sheets, embalmed with spices, and died an ordinary
death, without any wound, bruise or other harm, that might hasten his
corruption. But this coarse has neither shroud nor spice, since these are to be
seen in the tomb, and there is not a part in his body but had some help to
further it to decay; and art thou not afraid to see him, yea to touch him, yea
to embrace and carry him naked in thine arms?

If thou had remembered Gods promise, that His holy one should not see
corruption: If thou had believed that his Godhead remaining with his
body, could have preserved it from perishing, thy faith had been more worthy
of praise, but thy love less worthy of admiration, since the more corruptible
thou did conceive him, the more combers thou did determine to overcome,
and the greater was thy love in being able to conquer them. But thou would
have thought thy ointments rather harms than helps, if thou had been settled
in that belief, and for so heavenly a coarse embalmed with God, all earthly
spices would have seemed a disgrace. If likewise thou had firmly trusted
upon his resurrection, I should marvel at thy constant designement, since all
hazards in taking him should have been with usury repaide, if lying in thy
lap, thou might have seen him revived, and his disfigured and dead body
beautified in thine arms with a divine majesty. If thou had hoped so good
fortune to thy waterie eyes, that they might have been first cleared with the
beams of his desired light, or that his eyes might have blessed thee with the
first fruits of his glorious looks: If thou had imagined any likelihood
to have made happy thy dying heart with taking in the first gaspes of his
living breath, or to have heard the first words of his pleasing voice: Finally
if thou had thought to have seen his injuries turned to honors, the
marks of his misery to ornaments of glory, and the depth of thy heaviness
to such an height of felicity, whatsoever thou had done to obtain him had
been but a mite for a million, and too slender a price for so sovereign a
peniworth.

But having no such hopes to uphold thee, and so many motives to plonge thee in
despair, how could thy love be so mighty, as neither to feel a woman's fear
of so deformed a coarse, nor to think the weight of the burden too heavy for
thy feeble arms, nor to be amated with a world of dangers that this attempt
did carry with it?

But affection cannot fear whom it affects, love feels no load of him it
loves, neither can true friendship be frighted from rescuing so affied a friend.

What meanest thou then, o comfort of her life, to leave so constant a
wel-willer so long vncomforted, and to punish her so much, that so well
deserves pardon? Dally no longer with so known a love, which so many trials
avouch most true. And since she is nothing but what it pleases thee, let her
taste the benefit of being only thine. She did not follow the tide of thy
better fortune to shift sail when the stream did alter course. She began not
to love thee in thy life to leave thee after death: Neither was she such a
guest at thy table that meant to be a stranger in thy necessity. She left thee
not in thy lowest ebb, she revolted not from thy last extremity: In thy life
she served thee with her goods: in thy death she departed not from the Cross:
after death she came to dwell with thee at thy grave. Why then do thou not
say with Naomi? Blessed be she of our Lord, because what courtesy she afforded
to the quick, she has also continued toward the dead. A thing so much the
more to be esteemed in that it is most rare.

Do not sweet Lord any longer delay her. Behold she has attended thee these
three days, and she has not what to eat, nor wherewith to foster her
famished soul, unless thou by discovering thy self do minister unto her
the bread of thy body, and feed her with the food that has in it all taste of
sweetness. If therefore thou will not have her to faint in the way, refresh
her with that which her hunger requires. For surely she cannot long enjoy the
life of her soul.

But fear not Mary, for thy tears will obtain. They are to o mighty orators
to let any suit fall, and though they pleaded at the most rigorous bar, yet
have they so persuading a silence, and so conquering a complaint, that by
yielding they overcome, and by entreating they command. They tie the tongues of
all accusers, and soften the rigor of the seuerest Judge. Yea they win the
invincible, and bind the omnipotent. When they seem most pitiful, they have
great power, and being most forsaken they are more victorious. Repentant eyes
are the Cellers of Angels, and penitent tears their sweetest wines; which the
savor of life perfumeth, the taste of grace sweeteneth, and the purest colors
of returning innocence highly beautifieth. This deaw of devotion never
fails, but the Sun of justice draws it up, and upon what face soever it
droppeth, it makes it amiable in Gods eye. For this water has thy heart been
long a limbecke, sometimes distilling it out of the weeds of thy own offenses
with the fire of true contrition. Sometimes out of the flowers of spiritual
comforts, with the flames of contemplation, and now out of the bitter herbs
of thy masters miseries, with the heat of a tender compassion. This water has
better graced thy looks, than thy former alluring glances. It has settled
worthier beauties in thy face, than all thy artificial paintings. Yea this
only water has quenched Gods anger, qualified his justice, recovered his
mercy, merited his love purchased his pardon, and brought forth the spring of
all thy favors. Thy tears were the procters for thy brothers life, the
inuiters of those Angels for thy comfort, and the suitors that shall be rewarded
with the first sight of thy revived Savior. Rewarded they shall be, but not
refrained, altered in their cause, but their course continued. Heaven would
weep at the loss of so precious a water, and earth lament the absence of so
fruitful showers. No, no, the Angels must still bath themselves in the pure
streams of thine eyes, and thy face shall still be set with this liquid
pearl, that as out of thy tears, were stricken the first sparks of thy Lords
love, so thy tears may be the oil to nourish and feed his fame. Till death
dam up the springs, they shall never cease running: and then shall thy soul
be ferried in them to the harbor of life, that as by them it was first passed
from sin to grace, so in them it may be wasted from grace to glory. In the
mean time rear up thy fallen hopes, and gather confidence both of thy speedy
comfort, and thy Lords well being

Jesus says unto her, Marie, She turning, says unto him: Rabboni.

O loving master, thou did only defer her consolation, to increase it,
that the delight of thy presence, might be so much the more welcome, in that
through thy long absence it was with so little hope so much desired. Thou were
content she should lay out for thee so many sighs, tears and plaints, and
did purposely adiourne the date of her payment, to requite the length of
these delays, with a larger loan of joy. It may be she knew not her former
happiness, till she was weaned from it: nor had a right estimate in valuing
the treasures with which thy presence did enrich her, until her extreme
poverty taught her their inestimable rate. But now thou show by a sweet
experience, that though she paid thee with the dearest water of her eyes, with
her best breath, and tenderest love, yet small was the price that she bestowed
in respect of the worth she received. She sought thee dead, and imprisoned in a
stony gayle, and now she finds thee both alive, and at full liberty. She
sought thee shrined in a shroud, more like a leaper than thy self, left as the
model of the uttermost misery, and the only pattern of the bitterest
unhappiness; and now she finds thee invested in the robes of glory, the
president of the highest, and both the owner and giver of all felicity.

And as all this while she has sought without finding, wept without comfort,
and called without answers: so now thou did satisfy her seeking with thy
coming, her tears with thy triumph, and all her cries with this one word,
Mary. For when she heard thee call her in thy wonted manner, and with thy
usual voice, her only name issuing from thy mouth, wrought so strange an
alteration in her, as if she had been wholly new made when she was only named.
For whereas before the violence of her grief had so benumbed her, that her
body seemed but the hearse of her dead heart, and the coffin of an vnliuing
soul, and her whole presence but a representation of a double funeral, of
thine and of her own: now with this one word her senses are restored, her
mind lightened, her heart quickened, and her soul revived.

But what marvel though with one word he raise the dead spirits of his poor
Disciple, that with a word made the world, and even in this very word shows
an omnipotent power?

Mary she was called as well in her bad as in her reformed estate, and both her
good and evil, was all of Mary's working. And as Marie signifies no less
what she was, than what she is: so is this one word, by his virtue that
speaks it, a repetition of all her miseries, an Epitome of his mercies, and a
memorial of all her better fortunes. And therefore it laid so general a
discovery of her self before her eyes, that it awaked her most forgotten
sorrows, and mustered together the whole multitude of her joys, and would
have left the issue of their mutiny very doubtful, but that the presence and
notice of her highest happiness decided the quarrel, and gave her joys the
victory.

For as he was her only Sun, whose going down left nothing but a dumpish
night of fearful fancies, wherein no star of hope shined, and the brightest
planets were changed into dismal signs: so the serenity of his countenance,
and authority of his word, brought a calm and well tempered day, that chasing
away all darkness, and dispercing the clouds of melancholy, cured the lethargy
and brake the dead sleep of her astonished senses.

She therefore ravished with his voice, and impatient of delays, takes his
talk out of his mouth, and to his first and yet only word answered but one
other, calling him Rabboni, that is, Master. And then sudden joy rowsing all
other passions, she could no more proceed in her own, than give him leave to
go forward with his speech.

Love would have spoken, but fear enforced silence. Hope frames the words,
but doubt melts them in the passage: and when her inward conceits served to
come out, her voice trembled, her tongue faltered, her breath failed. In fine,
tears issued in liew of words, and deep sighs in stead of long sentences,
the eyes supplying the tongues default, and the heart pressing out the
vnsillabled breath at once, which the conflict of her disagreeing passions
would not suffer to be sorted into the several sounds of intelligible speeches.

For such is their estate that are sick with a surfeit of sudden joy, for the
attaining of a thing vehemently desired. For as desire is ever vshered by hope,
and waited on by fear, so is it credulous in entertaining conjectures, but
hard in gronnding a firm belief. And though it be apt to admit the least
shadow of wished comfort, yet the hotter the desire is to have it, the more
perfect assurance it requires for it: which so long as it wants the first
news or appearance of that which is in request, is rather an alarm to summon
up all passions, than retreit to quiet the desire. For as hope presumes the
best, and inuiteth joy to gratulate the good success: so fear suspecteth it
too good to be true, and calls up sorrow to bewail the uncertainty. And
while these enterchange objections and answers, sometimes fear falls into
despair, and hope rises into repining anger; and thus the skirmish still
continues, til evidence of proof conclude the controversy.

Marie therefore though she suddenly answered upon notice of his voice, yet
because the novelty was so strange, his person so changed, his presence so
unexpected, and so many miracles laid at once before her amazed eyes, she found
a sedition in her thoughts; til more earnest viewing him exempted them from all
doubt.

And then though words would have broken out, and her heart sent into his
duties that she ought him, yea, every thought striving to be first uttered, and
to have the first room in his gracious hearing, she was forced as an
indifferent arbitrer among them, to seal them up all under silence by
suppressing speech, and to supply the want of words, with more significant
actions. And therefore running to the haunt of her chiefest delights, and
falling at his sacred feet, she offered to bath them with tears of joy, and
to sanctify her lips with kissing his once grievous but now most glorious
wounds.

She stayed not for any more words, being now made blessed with the Word
himself, thinking it a greater benefit at once to feed all her wishes, in the
homage, honor, and embracing of his feet, then in the often hearing of his
less comfortable talk.

For as the nature of love coueteth not only to be united, but if it were
possible wholly transformed out of it self into the thing it loves: so does
it most affect that which most unites, and prefers the least conjunction
before any distant co^tentment. And therefore to see him did not suffice her; to
hear him did not quiet her; to speak with him was not enough for her; and
except she might touch him, nothing could please her. But though she humbly
fell down at his feet to kiss them, yet Christ did forbid her, saying: Do
not touch me, for I am not yet ascended to my Father.

O Jesus, what mystery is in this? Being dead in sin, she touched thy mortal
feet that were to dye for her sake, and being now alive in grace, may she not
touch thy glorious feet, that are no less for her benefit revived? She was
once admitted to anoint thy head, and is she now unworthy of access to thy
feet? Do thou now command her from that for which thou were wont to commend
her, and by praising the deed did move her often to do it? Since other women
shall touch thee, why has she a repulse? yea since she her self shall touch
thee hereafter, why is she now rejected? What meanest thou, O Lord, by thus
debarring her of so desired a duty? and since among all thy Disciples thou have
vouchsafed her such a prerogative, as to honor her eyes with thy first sight,
and her ears with thy first wo^ds* why deniest thou the privilege of thy
first embracing? If the multitude of her tears have won that favor for her
eyes, and her longing to hear thee, so great a recompense to her ears, why
do thou not admit her hands to touch, and her mouth to kiss thy holy feet,
since the one with many plaints, and the other with their readiness to all
services, seemed to have earned no less reward? But notwithstanding all this,
thou preuentest the effect of her offer, with forbidding her to touch thee, as
if thou had said:

O Mary, know the difference between a glorious and a mortal body, between
the condition of a momentary and of an eternal life. For since the immortality
of the body and the glory both of body and soul are the endowments of an
heavenly inhabitant, and the rights of another world, think not this favor to
seem here ordinary, nor leave to touch me a common thing.

It were not so great a wonder to see the stars fall from their Spheres, and
the Sun forsake Heaven, and to come within the reach of a mortal arm, as
for me that am not only a Citizen, but the Sovereign of Saints, and the Sun
whose beams are the Angels bliss, to show my self visible to the Pilgrims of
this world, and to display eternal beauties to corruptible eyes. Though I be
not yet ascended to my Father, I shall shortly ascend, and therefore measure
not thy demeanor toward me by the place where I am, but by that which is due
unto me: and then thou will rather with reverence fall down a far off, than
with such familiarity presume to touch me. Do thou not believe my former
promises? Have thou not a constant proof by my present words? Are not thine
eyes and ears sufficient testimonies, but that thou must also have thy hands
and face witnesses of my presence? Touch me not, o Mary, for if I do deceive
thy sight, or delude thy hearing, I can as easily beguile thy hand, and
frustrate thy feeling. Or if I be true in any one, believe me in all, and
embrace me first in a firm faith, and then thou shall touch me with more
worthy hands. It is now necessary to weane thee from the comfort of my
external presence, that thou may learn to lodge me in the secrets of thy
heart, and teach thy thoughts to supply the offices of outward senses. For in
this visible shape I am not here long to be seen, being shortly to ascend unto
my Father: but what thine eye then sees not, thy heart shall feel, and my
silent parley will find audience in thy inward ear. Yet if thou fear lest
my ascending should be so sudden, that if thou do not now take thy leave of
my feet with thy humble kisses and loving tears, thou shall never find the
like opportunity again, license from thee that needless suspicion. I am not
yet ascended unto my Father, and for all such duties, there will be a more
convenient time. But now go about that which requires more have, and run to my
brethren and inform them what I say, That I will go before them into Galilee,
there shall they see me.

Mary therefore preferring her Lords will before her own wish, yet sorry that
her will was worthy of no better event, departed from him like an hungry
Infant pulled from a full teate, or a thirsty Heart chased from a sweet
fountain. She judged her self but an unlucky messenger of most joyful
tidings, being banished from her masters presence, to carry news of his
resurrection. Alas (says she) and cannot others be happy without my
unhappiness? or cannot their gains come in, but through my loss? Must the
dawning of their day, be the evening of mine, and my soul robbed of such a
treasure to enrich their ears? O my heart return thou to enjoy him: why go
thou with me that am enforced to go from him? In me thou art but in prison, and
in him is thy only Paradise I have buried thee long enough in former sorrows,
and yet now when thou were half revived, I am constrained to carry thee from
the spring of life. Alas, go seek to better thy life in some more happy
breast, since I, evil deserving creature, am nothing different from that I was,
but in having taken a taste of the highest delight, that the knowledge and want
of it might drown me in the deepest misery.

Thus duty leading, and love withholding her, she goes as fast backward in
thought, as forward in pace, ready eftsoons to faint for grief, but that a
firm hope to see him again, did support her weakness. She often turned
toward the Tomb to breathe, deeming the very air that came from the place
where he stood, to have taken virtue of his presence, and to have in it a
refreshing force above the course of nature. Sometimes she forgets her
self, and love carries her in a golden distraction, making her to imagine
that her Lord is present, and then she seems to demand him questions, and to
hear his answers: she dreameth that his feet are in her folded arms, and
that he gives her soul a full repast of his comforts. But alas when she
comes to herself, and finds it but an illusion, she is so much the more
sorry, in that the only imagination being so delightful, she was not worthy
to enjoy the thing it self. And when she passes by those places where her
Master had been: O stones (says she) how much more happy are you than I, most
wretched caitiffe, since to you was not denied the touch of those blessed feet,
whereof my evil deserts have now made me unworthy? Alas what crime have I of
late committed, that has thus cancelled me out of his good conceit, and
estranged me from his accustomed courtesy? Had I but a lease of his love for
term of his life? or did my interest in his feet expire with his deceasse? In
them with my tears I writ my first supplication for mercy, which I pointed
with sighs, folded up in my hair, and humbly sealed with the impression of my
lips. They were the doors of my first entrance into his favor, by which I was
graciously entertained in his, heart, and admitted to do homage unto his head,
while it was yet a mortal mirror of immortal majesty, an earthly seat of an
heavenly wisdom, containing in man a Gods felicity.

But alas, I must be contented to bear a lower sail, and to take down my
desires to far meaner hopes, since former favors are now too high marks for
me to aim at.

O mine eyes, why are you so ambitious of heavenly honors? He is now too
bright a Sun for so weak a sight: your looks are limited to meaner light;
you are the eyes of a Bat, and not of an Eagle; you must humble your selves to
the twilight of inferior things, and measure your sights by your slender
substance. Gaze not too much upon the blaze of eternity, lest you lose your
selves in too much self delight, and being too curious in sifting his
majesty, you be in the end oppressed with his glory. No, no, since I am
rejected from his feet, how can I otherwise presume, but that my want of faith
has dislodged me out of his heart, and thrown me out of all possession of his
mind and memory. Yet why should I stoop to so base a fear? when want of
faith was aggrieued with want of all goodness, he disdained not to accept me
for one of his number: and shall I now think that he will for my faint belief
so rigorously abandon me? And is the sincerity of my love, wherein he has no
partner, of so slender account, that it may not hope for some little spark of
his wonted mercy? I will not wrong him with so unjust a suspicion, since his
appearing improueth it, his words overthrow it, his countenance does dissuade
it, why then should I suck so much sorrow out of so vain a surmise?

Thus Mary's traveling fancies, making long voyages in this short journey, and
wavering between the joy of her vision, and the grief of her denial
entertained her in the way, and held her parley with such discourses as are
incident unto minds, in which neither hope is full master of the field, nor
fear has received an utter overthrow. But as she was in this perplexed
manner, now falling, now rising in her own uncertainties, she finds on the
way the other holy woman that first came with her to the grave, whom the Angels
had now assured of Christ's resurection.

And as they passed all forwards toward the Disciples: Behold Jesus met them
saying, All hail. But they came near, and took hold of his feet, and
worshipped him. Then Jesus said unto them, Fear not: Go ^^l my brethren that
they go into Gallilee, there they shall see me.

O Lord how profound are thy judgments, and unsearchable thy counsels? Does
her sorrow sit so near thy heart, or thy repulse rebound with such regret by
seeing her wounded love bleed so fast at her eyes, that thy late refusal must
so soon be requited with so free a grant? Is it thy pity, or her change,
which cannot allow that she should any longer fast from her earnest longing?

But o most mild Physician, well know thou that thy sharp corrosiue with
bitter smart angered her tender wound, which being rather caused by unwitting
ignorance than wilful error, was as soon cured as known. And therefore thou
quickly applyest a sweet lenitiue to assuage her pain, that she might
acknowledge her forbidding, rather a fatherly check to her unsettled faith,
than an austere rejecting her for her fault: and therefore thou admittest her
to kiss thy feet, the two conduits of grace, and seals of our redemption,
renewing her a Charter of thy unchanged love, and accepting of her the vowed
sacrifice of her sanctified soul.

And thus gracious Lord have thou finished her seares, assured her hopes,
fulfilled her desires, satisfied her loves, stinted her tears, perfected her
joys, and made the period of her expiring griefs, the preamble to her now
entering, and never ending pleasures.

O how merciful a Father thou art to left Orphans, how easy a Judge to
repentant sinners, and how faithful a friend to sincere lovers! It is
undoubtedly true, that thou never leauest those that love thee, and thou love
such as rest their affiance in thee. They shall find thee liberal above
desert, and bountiful beyond hope: a measure of thy gifts, not by their merits
but thine own mercy.

O Christian soul, take Mary for thy mirror, follow her affection, that like
effects may follow thine. Learn o sinful man of this once a sinful woman;
that sinners may find Christ if their sins be amended. Learn that whom
sin loses, love recouereth, whom faintness of faith chaseth away, firmness
of hope recalleth; and that which no other mortal force, favor or policy
can compass, the continued tears of a constant love are able to attain.
Learn of Mary, for Christ to fear no encounters* out of Christ to desire no
comforts, and with the love of Christ to overrule the love of all things R^se
early in the morning of thy good motions, and let them not sleep in sloth,
when diligence may perform them. Run with repentance to thy sinful heart
which should have been the Temple, but through thy fault was no better than a
Tomb for Christ, since having in thee no life to feel him, he seemed unto thee
as if he had been dead. Role away the stone of thy former hardness, remove all
thy heavy loads that oppress thee in sin, and look into thy soul, whether
thou can there find the Lord. If he be not within thee, stand weeping
without, and seek him in other creatures, since being present in all, he may be
found in any. Let faith be thine eye hope thy guide, and love thy light. Seek
him and not his: for himself, and not for his gifts. If thy faith have found
him in a cloud, let thy hope seek to him. If hope have led thee to see him,
let love seek further into him. To move in thee a desire to find, his goods
are precious: and when he is found, to keep thee in a desire to seek, his
treasures are infinite. Absent, he must be sought to be had; being had, he must
be sought to be more enjoyed. Seek him truly, and no other for him. Seek him
purely, and no other thing with him. Seek him only, and nothing besides him.
And if at the first search he appear not, think it not much to persevere in
tears, and to continue thy seeking. Stand upon the earth, trending under thee
all earthly vanities, and touching them with no more than the soles of thy
feet, that is with the lowest and least part of thy affection. To look the
better in the Tomb, bow down thy neeke to the yoke of humility, and stoop
from lofty and proud conceits, that with humbled and lowly looks thou may
find whom swelling and haughty thoughts have driven away. A submitted soul
soonest wins his return, and the deeper it sinketh in a self contempt, the
higher it climeth in his highest favors. And if thou perceiuest in the Tomb
of thy heart the presence of his two first Messengers, that is, at the feet,
sorrow for the bad that is past, and at the head desire to a better that is to
come, entertain them with sighs, and welcome them with penitent tears: yet
reckoning them but as herbingers of thy Lord, cease not thy seeking till thou
find himself. And if he vouchsafe thee his glorious sight, offering
himself to thy inward eyes, presume not of thy self to be able to know him,
but as his unworthy suppliant prostrate thy petitions unto him* that thou may
truly discern him, and faithfully serve him. Thus preparing thee with
diligence, coming with speed, standing with high lifted hopes, and stooping
with inclined heart, if with Mary thou crauest no other solace of Jesus but
Jesus himself, he will answer thy tears with his presence, and assure thee
of his presence with his own words, that having seen him thy self, thou
may make him known to others: saying with Mary, I have seen our Lord, and
these things he said unto me.

MOst lines do not
the best conceit contain,
Few words well coucht
may comprehend much matter:
Then, as to use the first
is counted vain,
So is it praiseworthy
to conceit the latter.
The grauest wits
that most grave works expect.
The quality,
not quantity respect.
The smallest spark
will cast a burning heat,
Base cottages
may harbor things of worth:
Then though this volume be,
nor gay, nor great,
Which under your Protection
I set forth:
Do not with coy
disdainefull oversight
Deny to read
this well meant orphans mite.
And since his father
in his infancy
Provided patrons
to protect his heir:
But now by Deaths
none-sparing cruelty,
Is turned an orphan
to the open air:
I, his unworthy
foster-sire have darde,
To make you
Patronizer of this ward.
You glorying issues
of that glorious dame,
Whose life is made
the subject of deaths will:
To you, succeeding hopes
of mothers fame,
I dedicate this fruit
of South wels quill:
He for your uncles comfort
first it writ,
I for your consolation
priat and send you it.
Then daine in kindness
to accept the work,
Which be in k^ndnesse writ,
I send to you:
The which till now clouded,
obscure did lurk;
But now opposed
to each Readers view,
May yield commodious fruit
to every wight,
That feels his conscience pricked
by Parcaes spite.
But if in ought
I have presumptuous been,
My pardon-crauing pen
implores your favor:
If any fault in print
be past unseen
To let it pass,
the Printer is the crauer,
So shall he thank you,
and I by duty bound,
Pray, that in you
may all good gifts abound.

The Author to the Reader.
IF the Athenians erected an altar to an unknown god, supposing he would be
pleased with their devotion, though they were ignorant of his name: better may
I presume that my labor may be grateful, being devoted to such men, whose
names I know, and whose fame I have heard, though unacquainted with their
persons. I intended this comfort to him whom a lamenting sort has left most
comfortless, by him to his friends, who have equal portions in this sorrow.
But I think the Philosophers rule will be here verified, that it shall be last
in execution, which was first designed, and he shall last enjoy the effect,
which was first owner of the cause. Thus let Chance be our rule since Choice
may not, and into which of your hands it shall fortune, much honor and
happiness may it carry with it, and leave in their hearts as much joy, as it
found sorrow. Where I borrow the person of an History, as well touching the
dead, as the yet suruiuing, I build upon report of of such Authors, whose
hoarie heads challenge credit, and whose eyes and ears were witnesses of
their words. To crave pardon for my pain were to slander a friendly office,
and to wrong their courtesies, whom Nobility never taught to answer affection
with anger, or to wage duty with dislike: and therefore I humbly present unto
them with as many good wishes, as good will can measure from the best meaning
mind, that has a willingness rather to offoord, then to offer due service,
were not the mean as worthless as the mind is willing.

R. S.

The Triumphs over Death: OR, A Consolatorie Epistle for troubled minds, in the
affects of dying friends.
IF it be a blessing of the virtuous to mourn it is the reward of this, to be
comforted; and he that pronounced the one, promised the other. I doubt not, but
that Spirit, whose nature is Love, and whose name Comforter, as he knows the
cause of our grief, so has he salued it with supplies of grace, pouring into
your wound no less oil of mercy then wine of justice; yet since courtesy
owes compassion as a duty to the afflicted, and nature has ingrafted a
desire to find it, I thought good to show you by proof, that you carry not
your cares alone, though the load that lies on others can little lighten your
burden: her deceasse can not but sit nearer your heart, whom you had taken so
deep into a most tender affection. That which dies to our love, being always
alive to our sorrow, you would have been kind to a less loving sister: yet
finding in her so many worths to be loved, your love wrought more earnestly
upon so sweet a subject, which now being taken from you, I presume your grief
is no less then your love was; the one of these being ever the measure of the
other: the Scripture moves us to bring forth our tears on the dead, a thing
not offending grace, and a right to reason. For to be without remorse in the
death of friends, is neither incident nor convenient to the nature of man,
having too much affinity to a savage temper, and overthrowing the ground of
all piety, which is a mutual sympathy in each of others miseries: but as not
to feel sorrow in sorrowful chances, is to want sense, so, not to bear it
with moderation, is to want understanding, the one brutish, the other
effeminate: and he has cast his account best, that has brought his sum to
the mean. It is no less fault to exceed in sorrow, then to pass the limits
of competent mirth, since excess in either is a disorder in passion, though
that sorrow of courtesy be less blamed of men, because, if it be a fault, it
is also a punishment, at once causing and tasting torments. It is no good sign
in the sick to be senseless in his pains, as bad it is to be vnusually
sensitive, being both either herbingers or attendants of death. Let sadness,
since it is a due to the dead, testify a feeling of pity, not any pang of
passion, and bewray rather a tender then a dejected mind. Mourn, as that your
friends may find you a living brother, all men a discreet mourner, making
sorrow a signell, not a superior of reason: some are so obstinate in their
own will, that even time the natural remedy of the most violent agonies,
cannot by any delays assuage their grief: they entertain their sorrow with
solitary muses, and feed their sighs and tears; they pine their bodies, and
draw all pensive consideration to their minds, nursing their heaviness with a
melancholy humor, as though they had vowed themselves to sadness, unwilling
it should end till it had ended them, wherein their folly sometimes finds a
ready effect; that being true which Solomon observed, Pro 1.25
that as a moath the garment, and a worm the wood, so does sadness persuade
the heart. But this impotent softnes fitteth not sober minds. We must not make
a lives profession of a seven nights duty, nor under color of kindness to
other; be unnatural to our selves: if some in their passion joined their
thoughts into such labyrinths, that neither wit knows, nor will cares how
long, or how far they wander in them, it discovers their weakness, but
discerns our meditation. It is (for the most) the fault, not of all, but of
the silliest women, who next to the funeral of their friends, deem it a
second widowhood, to force their tears, and make it their happiness, to seem
most unhappy, as though they had only been left alive, to be a perpetual map
of dead folks misfortunes: but this is, to arm an enemy against our selves,
and to yield Reason prisoner to Passion, putting the sword in the rebels
hand, when we are least able to withstand his treason. Sorrow once settled, is
not lightly removed, easily winning, but not so easily surrendering possession;
and where it is not excluded in time, it challenges a place by prescription.
The Scripture warns us, not to give our hearts to sadness, yea rather, to
reject it as a thing not beneficial to the dead, yea prejudicial to our
selves; Eccles. 38.
Ecclesiasticus allows but seven days to mourning, judging moderation in
plaint to be a sufficient testimony in good will, and a needful office of
wisdom. Much sorrow for the dead, is either the child of self-love, or of
rash judgment. If we should shead our tears for others death, as a mean to
our contentment, we show but our own wound perfect lovers of our selves: if we
lament their deceasse as their hard destiny, we attache them of evil
deserving, with too peremtory a censure, as though their life had been an
arise, and their death a leap into small perdition; for otherwise a good
departure craves small condoling, being but a harbor from storms, and an
entrance unto felicity. But you know your sister too well to incur any blame
in these respects. And experience of her life has stored your thoughts with
notice of so rare virtues, as might sooner make her memory all enforcement to
joy, then any inducement to sorrow* and move you to esteem her last duties,
rather the triumph of her victory, then the farewels of her deceasse. She was
by birth, second to none, but unto the first in the realm, yet she measured
only greatness by goodness, making Nobility but the mirror of virtue; as
able to show things worthy to be seen, as apt to draw many eyes to behold
it, she suited her behavior to her birth, and enobled her birth with her piety,
leaving her house more beholding to her for having honored it with the glory
of her virtues, then she was to it for the titles of her degree. She was high
minded in nothing, but in aspiring to perfection, and in the disdain of vice;
in other things covering her greatness with humility among her inferiors, and
showing it with courtesy among her peers. Of the carriage of her self, and
her sober gou^^ment may be a sufficient testimony, that envy her self was
dumb in her dispraise, finding in her much to re^ at, but naught to reprove.
The clearenesse of her honor I need not to mention, she having always armed
it with such modesty as taught the most intemperate tongues to be silent in
her presence, and answered their eyes with scorn and contempt, that did but
seem to make her an aim to passion; yea, and in this behalf, as almost in
all orhers, she has the most honorable and known Ladies of the land, so
common and known witnesses, that those that least loved her religion, were in
love with her demeanor, delivering their opinions in open praises. How mildly
she accepted the check of fortune fallen upon her without desert, experience
has been a most manifest proof, the temper of her mind being so easy, that
she found little difficulty in taking down her thoughts to a mean degree,
which true honor, not pride has raised to the former height. Her
faithfulness and love where she found true friendship, is written with tears
in many eyes, and will be longer registered in grateful memories of diverse that
have tried her in that kind, auowing her for secrecy, wisdom, and
constancy, to be a miracle in that sex: yea when she found least kindness in
others, she never lost it in her self, more willingly suffering then offering
wrong, and often weeping for their mishaps, whom though less loving her, she
could not but affect. Of the innocence of her life, this general each one can
auerre, that as she was grateful many ways, and memorable for virtues, so was
she free from all blemish of any vice, using, to her power, the best means to
keep continually an undefiled conscience: her attire was ever such as might
both satisfy a curious eye, and yet bear witness of a sober mind, neither
singular, nor vain, but such as her peers of best report used: her tongue was
very little acquainted with oaths, unless either duty or distrust did enforce
them: and surely they were needelesse to those that knew her, to whom the truth
of her words could not justly be suspected; much less was she noted of any
unfitting talk, which as it was ever hateful to her ears, so did it never
defile her breath. Of feeding she was very measureable, rather too sparing,
than too liberal a diet: so religious for observing of fasts, that never in
her sickness she could hardly be won to break them: and if our souls be
possessed in our patience, surely her soul was truly her own, whose rock
though often stricken with the rod of adversity. never yielded any more then to
give issue of eye streams: and though these through the tenderness of her
nature, and aptness of her sex, were the customarie tributes that her love
paid, more to her friends then her own misfortunes, yet were they not
accompanied with distempered words, or ill seeming actions, reason never
forgetting decency, though remembering pity. Her devotions she daily observed,
offering the daily sacrifice of an innocent heart, and stinting her felfe to
her times of prayer, which she performed with so religious a care, as well
showed that she knew how high a Majesty she served. I need not write how
dutifully she discharged all the behoofes of a most loving wife, since that was
the commonest theme of her praise: yet this may be said without improofe to
any, that whosoever in this behalf may be counted her equal, none can justly
be thought her superior. Where she owed, she paid duty, where she found she
returned courtesy; wheresoever she was known, she deserved amity; desirous of
the best, yet disdaining none but evil company: she was readier to requite
benefits then revenge wrongs, more grieved then angry with unkindness of
friends, when either mistaking or misreport occasioned any breaches: for if
their words carry credit, it entered deepest into her thoughts, they have
acquitted her from all spice of malice, not only against her friends, whose
dislikes were but a retire to slip further into friendship, but even her
greatest enemies, to whom if she had been a judge as she was a suppliant* I
assuredly think she would have redressed, but not revenged her wrongs In
sum, she was an honor to her predecessors, a light to her age, and a
pattern to her posterity; neither was her conclusion different from her
premises, or her death from her life, she showed no dismay, being warned of her
danger, carrying in her conscience, the safe conduct of innocence. But having
sent her desires to heaven before with a mild countenance, and a most calm
mind, in more hope then fear, she expected her own passage, she commended
both her duty and good will to all her friends, and cleared her heart from all
grudge toward her enemies, wishing true happiness to them both, as best
became so soft and gentle a mind, in which anger never stayed, but as an
unwelcome stranger: She made open profession that she did die true to her
religion, true to her husband, true to God and the world: she enjoyed her
judgment as long as she breathed, her body earnestly offering her last
devotions, supplying in thought what faintness suffered not her tongue to
utter: in the end, when her glass was run out, and death began to challenge
his interest, some laboring with too late remedies to hinder the delivery of
her sweet soul, she desired them eftsoons to let her go to God; and her hopes
calling her to eternal kingdoms, as one rather fallen asleep, then dyieg,
she most happily took her leave of all mortal miseries. Such was the life,
such was the death of your dearest sister, both so full of true comfort, that
this surely of her virtues may be a sufficient lenitiue to your bitterest
griefs. For you are not (I hope) in the number of those that reckon it a part
of their pain to hear of their best remedies, thinking the rehearsal of your
dead friends praises an vpbraiding of their loss: but since the oblivion of her
vertuues were injurious to her, let not the mention of her person be offensive
unto you, and be not you grieved with her death, with which she is best
pleased. So blessed a death is rather to be wished of us, then pitied in her,
whose soul triumphs with God, whose virtue still breaths in the mouths of
infinite praises and lives in the memories of all, to whom either experience
made her known, or fame was not envious to conceal her deserts. She was a
jewel, that both God and you desired to enjoy; he to her assured benefit
without self interest, you for allowable respects, yet employing her restraint
among certain hazards and most uncertain hopes. Be then vmpire in your own
cause, whether your wishes or Gods will imports more love, the one, the
adornement of her exile, the other, her return into a most blessed country.
And since it pleased God in this love to be your rival, let your discretion
decide the doubt, whom in due should carry the suite, the prerogative being but
a right to the one: for nature and grace being the motives of both your loves,
she had the best little in them* that was author of them: and she, if worthy to
be beloved of either, as she was of both, could not but prefer him to the
dearest portion of her deepest affection: let him with good leave gather the
grape of his own vine, and pluck the fruit of his own planting, and think
so curious works ever safest in the artificers hand, who is likeliest to love
them, and best able to preserve them. She did therefore her duty in dying
willingly: and if you will do yours, you must be willing with her death, since
to repine at her liking, is discurtesie at Gods, an impiety, both unfitting for
your approved virtue; she being in place where no grief can annoy her, she
has little need, or less joy of your sorrow; neither can she allow in her
friends, that she would loathe in her self, love never affecting likeness: if
she had been evil, she had not deserved our tears: being good, she cannot
desire them, nothing being less to the likeness of goodness; than to see it
self any cause of unjust disquiet or trouble to the innocent. Would Saul have
thought it friendship, to have wept for his fortune, in having found a
kingdom, 1. Sam. 17.
by seeking of cattle? or David account it a courtesy, to have sorrowed at his
success, that from following sheep, came to foil a giant, and to receive in
fine, a royal crown for his victory? why then should her lot be lamented,
whom higher favor has raised from the dust to sit with princes of Gods
people, Psalm. 112
if security had been given, that a longer life should still have been guided
by virtue, and followed with good fortune, you might pretend some cause to
complain of her deceasse. But if different effects should have crossed your
hopes (process of time being the parent of strange alterations) then had death
been friendlier then your self: and since it hung in suspense which of the two
would have happened, let us allow God so much discretion, as to think him the
fittest arbitrator in decision of the doubt: her foundations of happiness were
in the holy hills, Psalm 86.
and God saw it fittest for her building to be but low in the vale of tears:
and better it was it should be soon taken down, then by rising too high, to
have oppressed her soul with the ruins. Think it no injury that she is now
taken from you, but a favor, that she was lent you so long, and show no
unwillingness to restore God his own, since hitherto you have paid no usury
for it. Consider not how much longer you might have enjoyed her, but how much
sooner you might have lost her: and since she was held upon courtesy, not by any
covenant, take our sovereign right for a sufficient reason of her death; our
life is but lent; a good, to make thereof during the loan, our best commodity.
It is due debt to a more certain owner than our selves, and therefore so long
as we have it, we receive a benefit, when we are deprived of it, we have no
wrong: we are tennants at will of this clayie farm, not for term of years;
when we are warned out, we must be ready to remove, having no other title but
the owners pleasure: it is but an Inn, not an home: we came but to bait, not
to dwell, and the condition of our entrance was in fine to depart. If this
departure be grievous, it is also common, this to day to me, to morrow to thee;
and the case equally afflicting all, leaves none any cause to complain of
injurious usage.

Natures debt is sooner exacted of some than of other, yet is there no fault in
the creditor that exacteth but his own, but in the greediness of our eager
hopes, either repining that their wishes fail, or willingly forgetting their
mortality, whom they are unwilling by experience to see mortal* yet the
general tide wafteth all passengers to the same shore, some sooner, some
later, but all at the last: and we must settle our minds, to take our course as
it comes, never fearing a thing so necessary, yet ever expecting a thing so
uncertain. It seems that God purposely concealed the time of our death,
leaving us resolved between fear and hope of longer continuance. Cut off
unripe cares, lest with the notice and pensiveness of our divorce from the
world, we should lose the comfort of needful contentments, and before our
dying day, languish away with expectation of death. Some are taken in their
first step into this life, receiving in one, their welcome and farewell, as
though they had been borne, only to be buried, and to take their pasport in
this hourly middle of their course; the good, to prevent change, the bad, to
shorten their impiety. Some live till they be weary of life, to give proof of
their good hap, that had a kindlier passage, yet though the date be diverse, the
debt is all one, equally to be answered of all as their time expireth: Psalm. 88.
for who is the man shall live and not see death? since we all dye, and like
water slide upon the earth. In Paradise we received the sentence of Death, Genesis
5.
and here, as prisoners, we are kept in ward, tarying but our times till the
Jailer call us to our execution. Whom has any virtue eternized* or desert
commended to posterity, that has not mourned in life, and been mourned after
death, no assurance of joy being sealed without some tears? Even the blessed
Virgin the mother of God, was thrown down as deep in temporal miseries, as
she was advanced high in spiritual honors, none amongst all mortal creatures
finding in life more proof then she of her mortality. For, having the noblest
son that ever woman was mother of, not only above the condition of men, but
above the glory of Angels, being her son only, without temporal Father,
and thereby the love of both parents doubled in her breast, being her only
Son without other issue, and so her love of all children finished in him.
Yea, he being God, and she the nearest creature to Gods perfections, yet no
prerogative, either quitted her from mourning, or him from dying: and though
they surmounted the highest Angels in all other preheminences, yet were they
equal with the meanest men in the sentence of Death. And howbeit the blessed
Virgin being the pattern of Christian mourners, so tempered her anguish, that
there was neither any thing undone that might be exacted of a mother, nor any
thing done that might be misliked in so perfect a matron; yet by this we may
guess with what courtesies death is likely to friend us, that durst cause so
bloody funerals in so heavenly a stock, not exempting him from the law of
dying, that was the author of life, and soon after to honor his triumphs
with ruins and spoil of death. Seeing therefore that Death spares none, let
us spare our tears for better uses, being but an idol sacrifice to this deaf
and implacable executioner. And for this, not long to be continued, where they
can never profit, Nature did promise us a weeping life, exacting tears for
custom at our first entrance, and for suting our whole course in this doleful
beginning. Therefore they must be used with measure, that must be used so
often: and so many causes of weeping lying yet in the debt, since we cannot end
our tears, let us at the least reserve them: if sorrow cannot be shunned, let
it be taken in time of need, since otherwise being both troublesome and
fruitless, it is a double misery, or an open folly. We moisten not the ground
with precious waters, they were stilled to nobler ends, either by their fruits
to delight our senses, or by their operation, to preserve our healths. Our
tears are water of too high a price to be prodigally powered in the dust of any
graves. If they be tears of love, they perfume our prayers, making them odor
of sweetness, fit to be offered on the Altar before the throne of God: if
tears of contrition, they are water of life to the dying and corrupting
souls, Apoc. 8.
they may purchase favor, and repeal the sentence till it be executed, 3
King. 26.
as the example of Ezechias does testify, but when the punishment is past, and
the verdict performed in effect, their pleading is in vain, 2 Kin 8.11.
as David taught us when his child was dead, saying, that he was likelier to go
to it, than it, by his weeping, to return to him. Learn therefore to give
sorrow no long dominion over you. Wherefore the wise should rather mark, than
expect an end. Meet it not when it comes, do not inuit it when it is absent:
when you feel it, do not force it, since the brute creatures, which (Nature,
seldom erring in her course, guides in the mean) have but a short, though
vehement sense of their losses. You should bury the sharpness of your grief,
with the course, and rest contented with a kind, yet a mild compassion,
neither less than decent for you, nor more than agreeable to your nature and
judgment. Your much heaviness would renew a multitude of griefs, and your
eyes would be springs to many streams, adding to the memory of the dead, a new
occasion of plaint by your own discomfort. The motion of your heart measures
the beating of many pulses, which in any distemper of your quiet with the like
stroke will soon bewray themselves sick of your disease: your fortune though
hard, yet is it notorious, and though moved in mishap, and set in an unworthy
lantern, yet your own light shines far, and makes you markeable: every
one will bend an attentive eye upon you, observing how you ward this blow of
temptation, and whether your patience be a shield of proof, or easily entered
with these violent strokes. It is commonly expected, that so high thoughts
which have already climed over the hardest dangers, should not now stoop to
any vulgar or female complaints. Great personages, whose estate draws upon
them many eyes, as they cannot but be themselves, so may not they use the
liberty of meaner estates, the laws of Nobility not allowing them to direct
their deeds by their desires, but to limit their desires to that which is
decent.

Nobility is an aim for lower degrees to level at marks of higher
perfection, and like stately windows in the Northeast rooms of politic and
civil buildings, to let in such light, and lie open to such prospects, as may
afford their inferiors both to find means and motions to Heroical virtues.
If you should determine to dwell ever in sorrow, it were a wrong to your
wisdom, and countermanded by your quality. If ever you mind to surceasse it,
no time fitter than the present, since the same reasons that hereafter might
move you, are now as much in force. Yield to Wisdom that which you must yield
to Time: be beholding to your self, not to Time for the victory; make it a
voluntary work of discretion that will otherwise be a necessary work of
delay. We think it not enough to have our own measure brim full with evil,
unless we make it run over with others miseries, taking their misfortunes as
our punishments, and executing foreign penalties upon our selves. Yea disquiet
minds being ever bellows to their own flames, mistake often times others good
for ill, their folly making it a true scourge to them, howsoever it seemed
it was to others a benefit. Jacob out of Joseph's absence sucked such surmises, as
he made his heart a prey to his agonies, whereas that that buried him in his
own melancholies, raised Joseph to his highest happiness. If Mary Magdalen
said, and supposed she could have suncke no deeper in grief, than she had
already plunged her self; and yet, that which she imagined the uttermost of
evils proved in conclusion, the very bliss of her wishes; the like may be your
error, if you cumber your mind with thinking upon her death, which could
never be discharged from cares, till death set his hand to her acquittance, nor
receive the charter of an eternal being, till her soul were presented at the
sealing. I loath to rub the scarre of a deeper wound, for fear of renewing a
dead discomfort; yet if you will favor your own remedies, the maisterie over
that grief that springs from the root, may learn you to qualify this that
buddeth from the branch. Let not her losses move you that are acquainted with
greater of your own, and taught by experience to know how uncertain then
change is for who^ unconstant fortune throws the dice. If she want the wonted
titles, her part is now ended, and they were due but upon the stage: her loss
therein is but a wrack of wounds, in which she is but even with the height of
Princes, surpassing both her self in them, and the new honors of heavenly
style. If she have left her children, it was her wish, they should repay her
absence with usury; yet had she sent her first fruits before her as pledges of
her own coming. And now may we say that the Sparrow has found an home, and
the Turtle dove a neast, where she may lay her yonglings, enjoying some, and
expecting the rest. If she be taken from her friends, she is also delivered
from her enemies, in hope hereafter to enjoy the first, out of fear of ever
being troubled with the latter. If she be cut off in her youth, no age is
unripe for a good death; and having ended her task, though never so short yet
she has lived out her full time. Old age is venerable, not long, to be
measured by increase of virtues, not by number of years: for gravity
consists in wisdom, Sap. 4.
and an unspotted life is the ripeness of the perfectest age. If she were in
possibility of preferment, she could hardly have mounted higher, than from
whence she was thrown: having been bruised with the first, she had little will
to clime for a second fall. We might hitherto truly have said, this is that
Naomi, Ruth. 1.
she being to her end enriched with many outward and more inward graces. But,
whether hereafter she would have bid us not to call her Naomi, that is, fair,
but Mara, that signifies bitter, it is uncertain, since she might have fallen
into the widows felicity, that so changed her name to the likeness of her
lot. Insomuch that she is freed from more miseries then she suffered losses,
and more fortunate by not desiring, then she would be by enjoying fortunes
favor; which if it be not counted a folly to love, yet it is a true
happiness, not to need: we may rather think that Death was provided against
her imminent harms, then envious of any future prosperities: the times being
great with so many broils, that when they once fall in labor, we shall think
their condition securest whom absence has exempted, both from feeling the
bitter throws, and beholding the monstrous issue that they are likely to bring
forth. The more you tender her, the more temperate should be your grief, since
seeing you upon going, she did but step before you into the next world, to
which she thought you to belong more than to this, which has already given you
the most ungrateful congee. They that are upon removing, send their furniture
before them; and you still standing upon your departure, what ornament could
you rather wish in your future abode, then this that did ever please you? God
thither sends your Adamants, whither he would draw your heart, and casts
your anchors where your thoughts should lie at road, that seeing your love
taken out of the world, and your hopes disanchored from the stormy shore, you
might settle your desires where God seems to require them. If you would have
wished her life for an example to your house, assure your self she has left
her friends so inherited with her virtues, and so perfect patterns of her best
part, that who knows the suruiuours, may see the deceassed, and shall find
little difference, but in the number, which before was greater* but not better,
unless it were in one repetition of the same goodness: wherefore set your
self at rest in the ordinance of God, whose works are perfect, and whose
wisdom is infinite. The terms of our life are like the seasons of the year,
some for sowing, some for growing, and some for reaping; in this only
different, that as the heavens keep their prescribed periods, so the
succession of times have their appointed changes. But in the seasons of our
life, which are not the law of necessary causes, some are reaped in the seed,
some in the blade, some in the unripe ears, all in the end; this harvest
depending upon the Reapers will. Death is too ordinary a thing to seem any
nouelty, being a familiar guest in every house; and since his coming is
expected, and his errand unknown, neither his presence should be feared, nor
his effects lamented. What wonder is it to see fuel burned, spice-pouned, or
snow melted? And as little fear it is to see those dead that were borne upon
condition once to dye. She was such a compound as was once to be resolved unto
her simples, which is now performed, her soul being given to God, and her body
resorted into her first elements. It could not dislike you, to see your friend
removed out of a ruinous house, and the house it self destroyed and pulled
down, if you knew it were to build it in a statelier form, and to turn the
inhabitant with more joy into a fairer lodging. Let then your sisters soul
depart without grief, let her body also be altered into dust: withdraw your
eyes from the ruin of this cottage, and cast them upon the majesty of the
second building, which Saint Paul says shall be incorruptible, glorious,
strange, spiritual, and immortal. Night and sleep are perpetual mirrours,
figuring in their darkness, silence, shutting up of senses, the final end of
our mortal bodies: and for this some have entitled sleep the eldest brother
of Death: but with no less conuenience it might be called one of Deaths
tenants, near unto him in affinity of condition, yet far inferior in right,
being but tennant for a time, of that Death is the inheritance: for, by virtue
of the conueyance made unto him in Paradise, that dust we were, and to dust we
must return; he has hitherto showed his seigniory over all, exacting of us,
not only the yearly, but hourly reverence of time, which ever by minutes we
defray unto him: so that our very life is not only a memory, but a part of our
death, since the longer we have lived the less we have to live. What is the
daily less^ning of our life, but a continual dying? and therefore none is more
grieved with the running out of the last sand in an hour glass the with all
the rest so should not the end of ye last hour trouble us any more, the^ of so
many that went before, since that did but finish the course, that all the rest
were still ending: not the quantity but the quality commends our life; the
ordinary gain of long livers, being only a great burden of sin. For as in
tears, so in life, the value is not esteemed by the length, but by the fruit
and goodness, which often is more in the least than in the longest. What your
sister wanted in continuance, she supplied in speed; and as with her needle she
wrought more in a day than many Ladies in a year, having both excellent skill,
and no less delight in working: so with her diligence, doubling her endeavors,
she won more virtue in half than others in a whole life. Her death to time
was her birth to eternity, the loss of this world an exchange of a better,
one endowment that she had being impaired, but many far greater added to the
store. Mardocheus house was too obscure a dwelling for so gracious an Hester,
shrowding royal parts in the mantle of a mean estate, and shadowing immortal
benefits under earthly veiles. It was fitter, yt she being a sum of so rare
perfections, and so well worthy a spouse of our heavenly Ahashuerus, should be
carried to his court from her former abode, there to be invested in glory, and
to enjoy both place and pre-eminence answerable to her worthiness: her love
would have been less able to have borne your death, then your constancy to
brook hers, and therefore God mercifully closed her eyes before they were
punished with so grievous a sight, taking out to you but a new lesson of
patience out of your old book, in which, long study has made you perfect.
Though your hearts were equally balanced with a mutual and most entire
affection, and the doubt insoluble, which of you loved most; yet Death finding
her weaker, though not the weaker vessel, laid his weight in her balance, to
bring her soonest to her rest. Let your mind therefore consent to that which
your tongue daily craves, that Gods will may be done, as well here in earth of
her mortal body, as in that little heaven of her purest soul, since his will
is the best measure of all events. There is in this world continual
enterchange of pleasing and greeting accidents, still keeping their succession
of times and ouertaking each other in their several courses. No picture can be
all drawn of the brightest colors, nor an harmony consorted only of
trebbles: shadows are needful in expressing of proportions, and the base is a
principal part in perfect music: the condition of our exile here allows no
unmingled joy, our whole life is temperate between sweet and sower and we
must all look for a mixture of both. The wise so wish: better that they still
think of worse, accepting the one if it come with liking, and bearing the
other without impatience, being so much masters of each others fortunes, that
neither shall work them to excess. The dwarf grows not on the highest
hill, nor the tall man loses not his height in the lowest valley. And as a
base mind, though most at ease, will be dejected, so a resolute virtue in the
deepest distress is most impregnable. They evermore most perfectly enjoy their
comforts, that least fear their contraries: for a desire to enjoy, carries
with it a fear to lose; and both desire and fear are enemies to quiet
possession, making men rather owners of Gods benefits, then tenants at his
will. The cause of our troubles are, that our misfortunes hap, either to
unwitting or unwilling minds. Foresight preuenteth the one, necessity the
other: for he takes away the smart of present evils that attends their
coming, and is not amated with any cross, that is armed against all. Where
necessity works without our consent, the effect should never greatly afflict
us, grief being bootlesse, where it cannot help, needless where there was no
fault. God casts the dice, and gives us our chance; the most we can do, is
to take the point that the cast will afford us, not grudging so much that it
is no better, as comforting our selves it is no worse. If men should lay all
their evils together, to be afterward by equal portions divided among them,
most men would rather take that they brought, then stand to the division; yet
such is the partial judgment of self love, that every man judges his
selfe-misery too great, fearing if he can find some circumstance to increase
it, and making it intolerable, by thought to induce it. When Moses threw his
rod from him, it became a serpent, ready to sting, and affrighted him, insomuch
as it made him to fly, but being quietly taken up, it was a rod again,
serviceable for his use, no way hurtful. The cross of Christ, and rod of
every tribulation feeming to threaten stinging and terror to those that shun
and eschew it, but they that mildly take it up and embrace it with patience,
may say with David, thy rod and thy staff have been my comfort. Psalm. 12.
In this, affliction resembles the Crocadile; fly, it pursues and frighteth;
followed, it flies and fears, a shame to the constant, a tyrant to the
timorous. Soft minds that think only upon delights, admit no other
consideration: but in soothing things become so effeminate, as that they are
apt to bleed with every sharp impression. But he that uses his thoughts with
expectation of troubles, making their travel through all hazards, and apposing
his resolution against the sharpest encounters, finds in the proof facility
of patience, and eases the load of most heavy combers. We must have temporal
things in use, but eternal in wish, that in the one neither delight exceed
(in that we have no desire in that we want:) and in the other our most delight
is here in desire, and our whole desire is hereafter to enjoy. They straighten
too much their joys, that draw them into the reach and compass of their
senses, as if it were no facility where no sense is witness, whereas if we
exclude our passed and future contentments, pleasant pleasures have so fickle
assurance, that either as forestalled before their arrival, or interrupted
before their end, or ended before they are well begun, the repetition of former
comforts, and the expectation of after hopes, is ever a relief unto a virtuous
mind, whereas others, not suffering their life to continue in the conueniences
of that which was and shall be divided, this day from yesterday and to morrow,
and by forgetting all, and forecasting nothing abridge their whole life into
the moment of present time. Enjoy your sister in her former virtues, enjoy her
also in her future meeting, being both titles of more certain delights, than
her casual life could ever have warranted. If we will think of her death, let
it be as a warning to provide us, since that what happens to one, may happen
to another: yea, none can escape, that is common to all. It may be, that blow
that hither, was meant to some of us; and this missing was but a proof to take
better aim in the next stroke. If we were diligent in thinking of our own, we
should have little leisure to bewail others death. When the soldier in
skirmish sees his next fellow slain, he thinks more time to look to
himself, then to stand mourning an hapless mischance, knowing the hand which
sped so near a neighbor, cannot be far from his own head. But we in this
behalf are much like the silly birds, that seeing one stick in the lime bush,
striving to get away, with a kind of native pity are drawn to go to it, and
to rush themselves into the same misfortune; even so many for their friends
deceasse by musing on their lot, wittingly surfeit of too much sorrow, that
sometimes they make mourning their last deceasse. But slip not you into this
toil, that has taken none but weak affections; hold not your eyes always
upon your hardest happes, neither be you still occupied in counting your
losses. There are fairer parts in your body than scarres, better eye-markes in
your fortune than a sisters loss. You might happily find more comfort left, than
you would willingly lose; but that you have already resigned the solaces of
life, and shunned all comforts into the hopes of heaven; yet since there is some
difference between a purpose and proof, intending and performing, a subdued
enemy being ever ready to rebel when he finds mighty helps to make a party,
it is good to strengthen reason against the violence of Nature that in this and
like cases will renew her assaults. It was a forcible remedy that he used to
withstand the conceit of a most lamentable occurrent, who having in one ship
lost his children and substance, and hardly escaped himself from drowning,
went presently into an hospital of lazars, where finding in a little room
many examples of great miseries, he made the smart of others sores a lenitiue
to his own wound. For besides that, as lowness and poverty was common to
them, they had also many combers private to themselves, some wanting their
senses, some their wits, other their limbs, but all their health: in which
consideration he eased his mind, that Fortune had not given him the greatest
fall. If God had put you to Abraham's trial, commanding you to sacrifice the
hope of your posterity, and to be to your only son an author of death, as
you were to him of life: If you had been tied in the straights of Iepthaes
bitter devotions, embruing his sword in his own daughters blood, and ending
the triumphs over his enemies, with the voluntary funerals of his only
offspring: yet, since both their lives and their labors had been Gods undeniable
debt, your virtues ought to have obeyed, maugre all encounters of carnal
affection. And how much more in this case should you incline your love to Gods
liking, in which he has received a less part of his own, and that by the
usual easiest course of natures laws? Let God strippe you to the skin, yea
to the soul, so he stay with you himself* let his reproach be your honor,
his poverty your riches, and he, in lieu of all other friends. Think him
enough for this world, that must be all your possession for a whole eternity.
Let others ease their carefullnesse with borrowed pleasures, not bred out of
the true root, but begged of external helps. They shall still carry unquiet
minds, easily altered with every accident, since they labor not for any change
in their inward distempers, but by forgetting them for a time by outward
pastimes. Innocence is the only mother of true mirth, and a soul that is
owner of God, will quietly bear with all other wants nothing being able to
empouerish it but voluntary losses. Bear not therefore with her losses, for
she is won for ever, but with the momentary absence of your most happy sister;
yea it cannot justly be called an absence, many thoughts being daily in parley
with her, only men's eyes and ears unworthy to enjoy so sweet an object, have
resigned their interest, and interested this treasure in their hearts, being the
fittest shrines for so pure a Saint, whom, as none did know but did love, so
none can now remember but with devotion. Men may behold her with shame of their
former life, seeing one of the weaker sex honor her weakness with such a
train of perfections. Ladies may admire her, as a glory to their degree, in
whom honor was portraied in her full likeness, grace having perfected Natures
first draught with all the due colors of an absolute virtue. All women accept
her as a pattern to imitate her gifts and her good parts* having been so
manifested, that even they that can teach the finest stitches, may themselves
take new works out of this Sampler. Who then could drink any sorrow out of so
clear a Fountain, or bewail the estate of so happy a creature, to whom, as
to be her self was her praise; so to be as she is, was her highest bliss? You
still floate in a troublesome sea, and you find it by experience a sea of
dangers: how then can it pity you to see your sister on shore, and so safely
landed in so blisfull an harbor? Since your Judith has wrought the glorious
exploite against her ghostly enemies, Iud. 15.
for the accomplishing whereof she came into the dangerous camp and warfare of
this life; you may well give her leave to look home to her Bethulia, to
solemnize her triumph with the spoils of her victory. Yea, you should rather
have wished to have been Porter to let her in, than mourn to see her safe
returned. For so apparent hazards, she carried an heavenly treasure in an
earthly vessel, 2. Cor. 4.
which was too weak a treasury for so high riches: sin creeping in at the
window of our senses, and often picking the locks of the strongest hearts. And
for this it was laid up in a surer, to the which the heavens are walls, and
the Angels keepers. She was a pure fish, but yet swimming in muddy streams: it
was now time to draw her to shore, and to employ the inwards of her virtues to
medicinable uses, that laid on the coals of due consideration, they may draw
from our thoughts, the Devils suggestions, and applied to their eyes, Tob. 6.
which are blinded with the dung of flying vanities, the slime of their former
vanities may fall off, and leave them able to behold the clear light. The base
shell of a mortal body was unfit for so precious a Margarite, Mat. 13.
and the Ieweller that came into this world to seek good pearls, and gave,
not only all he had, but himself also, to buy them, thought now high time to
bring her unto his bargain, finding her grown to a Margarites full
perfection. She stood upon too low a ground to take view of her Saviors most
desired countenance, and forsaking the earth with Zacheus, Luke 9.
she climed up into the tree of life, there to give her soul a full repast of
her beauties. She departed with Iepthaes daughter from her fathers house, but
to pass some months in wandering about the mountains of this troublesome
world, which being now expired, she was after her pilgrimage, by covenant, to
return to be offered unto God in a grateful sacrifice, and to ascend out of
this desert like a stem of perfume out of burned spices. Let not therefore
the crown of her virtue be the foil of her constancy, nor the end of her
combers a renewing of yours. But since God was well pleased to call her, she not
displeased to go, and you the third twist to make a triple cord, saying, Our
Lord gave, and our Lord took away, as it has pleased our Lord, so has it
fallen out: the name of our Lord be blessed.

Clara ducum soboles, superis noua sedibus hospes,
Clausit in offenso tramite pura diem
Dotibus ornauit, superauit moribus ortum,
Omnibus vna prior, par fuit vna sibi:
Lux genus ingenio generi lux inclita virtus,
Virtutisque fuit men's generosa decus.
Mors muta at properata dies orbemque relinquit,
Prolem matre verum coniuge flore genus,
Occidit a se alium tulit hic occasus in ortum,
Viuat, ad occiduas non reditura vices.
OF Howards stem
a glorious branch is dead,
Sweet lights eclipsed
were at her decease:
In Buckhurst line
she gracious issue spread,
She heaven with two,
with four did earth increase:
Fame, honor, grace,
gave air unto her breath,
Rest glory, joys,
were sequels of her death.
Death aymde too high,
he hit too choice a wight,
Renowned for birth,
for life, for lively parts,
He killed her cares,
he brought her worths to light,
He robbed our eyes,
but has enricht our hearts:
Lot let out of her Arc
a Noyes Dove,
But many hearts
were Arkes unto her love.
Grace, Nature, Fortune,
did in her conspire,
To show a proof
of their united skill:
Sly Fortune ever false
did soon retire,
But double Grace
supplied false Fortunes ill.
And though she raught
not to Fortunes pitch,
In Grace and Virtue
few were found so rich.
Heaven of this heavenly Pearl
is now possessed,
In whose luster was
the blaze of honors light:
Whose substance pure,
of every good the best,
Whose price the crown
of highest right,
Whose praise to be her self,
whose greatest bliss,
To live, to love,
to be where now she is.
FINIS.

LONDON. Printed for W. Barret.

TO MY DEAR AFFECTED FRIEND M. D. S. Gentleman.
AS there is a method and order to be observed in all arts, for the
practitioners more facile attayning the effects of his endeavors: so is there
no less uniformity to be propounded in aiming at the true course of virtue:
the rules whereof, albeit they are directorie to the sum of all happiness, yet
do worldly courser studies entertain far more followers, whose erring
judgments (entangled with dull ignorance) cannot rightly prefer virtue, nor
effectually censure vice. For what clear sighted judgment will rely eternal
affairs upon the gliding slippernesse and running stream of this uncertain
life? or who (but one of distempered wits) would offer to dissemble with the
Amightie decipherer of all thoughts, in pretending virtue, and pursuing
vanity? It is a most servile disposition that will yield the prerogative of
the soul unto the body, and give flesh and blood liberty to determine the
course of this life, which are in manner but the bark and rind of a man,
being that the soul is the sovereign part, ordained to an high end of so
peerless dignity, and such estimate, that not all the gold and treasure of
the world, nor anything in heaven of less worth then the blood and life of
Almighty God, was able to buy it.

Let us not then injuriously deprive our souls of the due interest of grace
and virtue, but account this vain world with the wares thereof suitable to the
shop of idle Merchandise, unto which we have already been too long customers,
the traffic being toil, the wealth trash, the gain misery, and the whole
contents thereof detriments in grace, piety, and virtue.

Yours in firm affection R. S.

To the Christian Reader.
IF virtue by thy guide,
True comfort is thy path,
And thou secure from erring steps,
That lead to vengeance wrath.
Not widest open door,
Nor spacious ways she goes,
To straight and narrow gate and way,
She calls, she leads, she shows.
She calls, the fewest come,
She leads the humble sprited,
She shows them rest at rases end,
Souls rest to heaven invited.
It Is she that offers most,
It Is she that most refuse,
It Is she preue^ts the broad way plagues,
Which most do wilful choose.
Do choose the wide, the broad,
The left hand way and gate:
These vice applauds, these virtue loathes
And teaches hers to hate.
Her ways are pleasant ways,
Upon the right hand side,
And heavenly happy is that soul,
Takes virtue for her guide.
R. S.

A Preparatiue to prayer.
WHen thou do talk with God,
by prayer I mean,
Lift up pure hands,
lay down all lusts desires:
Fix thoughts on heaven,
present a conscience clean.
Such holy balm
to mercies throne aspires.
Confess faults guilt,
crave pardon for thy sin:
Tread holy paths,
call grace to guide therein.
It is the spirit
with reverence must obey,
Our makers will
to practice what he taught.
Make not the flesh
thy counsel when thou pray,
It Is enemy
to every virtuous thought.
It is the foe
we daily feed and cloth:
It is the prison
that the soul does loath.
Even as Elias
mounting to the sky,
Did cast his mantle
to the earth behind:
So when the heart
presents the prayer on high,
Exclude the world
from traffic with the mind,
Lips near to God,
and ranging heart within,
Is but vain babbling,
and conuerts to sin.
Like Abraham
ascending up the hill,
To sacrifice,
his servants left below,
That he might act
the great commanders will:
Without impeach
to his obedient blow.
Even so the soul
remote from earthly things,
Should mount saluations shelter,
mercies wings.
The effects of prayer.
THe Sun by prayer
did cease his course and staid:
The hungry Lions
fawnd upon their pray:
A walled passage
through the sea it made,
From furious fire
it banished heat away:
It shut the heavens
three years from giving rain,
It opened heavens,
and clouds powrd down again,
Ensamples of our Savior.
Our Savior
(pattern of true holiness)
Continual praide,
us by ensample teaching.
When he was baptized
in the wilderness,
In working miracles
and in his preaching.
Upon the mount*
in garden groans of death,
At his last Supper
at his parting breath.
O fortress of the faithful,
sure defense,
In which does Christians
cognizance consist:
Their victory their triumph
comes from thence,
So forcible, hell gates
cannot resist:
A thing whereby
both Angels, clouds, and stars,
At man's request
fight Gods reuengefull wars.
Nothing more grateful
in the Highest eyes,
Nothing more firm
in danger to protect us,
Nothing more forcible
to pierce the skies,
And not depart
till mercy do respect us,
And as the soul,
life to the body gives,
So prayer reuiues
the soul, by prayer it lives.
R. S.

Of the Foundations of virtuous and godly life.
The first Foundation.
THe first Foundation of a virtuous life is often and seriously to consider for
what end and purpose I was created, and what Gods designement was, when he made
me of nothing* and that not to have a being only, as a stone, nor with a bare
kind of life, or growing as a plant or tree, nor a power of sense or feeling
only as a brute beast, but a creature to his own likeness, endued with
reason and understanding* also why he now preserves me in this health, state
and calling. Finally, why he redeemed me with his own blood, bestowed so
infinite benefits upon me, and still continues his mercy toward me.

The end of man's creation.
THe end of my being thus made, redeemed, preserved, and so much benefited by
God, is this and no other, that I should in this life serve him with my whole
body, soul, and substance, and with what else soever is mine, and in the next
life enjoy him for ever in heaven.

Rules that follow of this Foundation.
I Was made of nothing by God, and received body and soul from him, and
therefore am I only his, not mine own: neither can I so bind or give my
self to any creature, but that I ought more to serve, love and obey God then
any creature in this world.

Secondly, I commit a kind of theft, and do God great wrong, so often as I
employ any part of my body or soul to any other end then to his service, for
which only I was created.

Thirdly, for this I do live, and for no other end but for this do all
creatures serve me: and when I turn the least thing whereof God has given me
the use or possessing to any other end then the service of God, I do God wrong
and abuse his creatures.

The second Foundation.
SEeing I was made to serve God in this life, and to enjoy him in the next, the
service of God, and the salvation of mine own soul, is the most weighty and
important business, and the most necessary matter wherein I must employ my
body, mind, time and labor: and all other affairs are so far forth to be
esteemed of me weighty or light, as they more or less tend to the furtherance
of this principal and most earnest business: for what avails it a man to
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?

Rules that follow of this Foundation.
FIrst what diligence, labor or cost, I would employ in any other temporal
matter of credit, living or life, all that I am bound to employ in the service
of God, and the salvation of my soul, and so much more as the weight of my
soul passes all other things.

Secondly, I ought to think the service of God and salvation of my soul, my
principal business in this world, and to make it my ordinary study and chief
occupation, and day and night to keep my mind so fixed upon it, that in every
action I still have it before mine eyes, as the only mark I shoot at.

The third Foundation.
I Cannot serve God in this world, nor go about to enjoy him in the next, but
that Gods enemies and mine own will repine and seek to hinder me, which
enemies are three: the world, the flesh, and the Devil. Wherefore I must
resolve my self, and set it down as a thing undoubted; that my whole life
must be as a continual combat with these adversaries, whom I must assure my
self to lie hourly in wait for me to seek their advantage, and that their
malice is so unplacable, and their hatred against me so rooted in them, that I
must never look to have one hour secure from their assaults, but that they
will from time to time, so long as there is breath in my body, still labor to
make me forsake and offend God, allure me to their service, and draw me to my
damnation.

Rules following of this Foundation.
I Must prepare my body and mind to all patience, and think it no news to be
tempted, but a point annexed necessarily to my profession, and therefore never
must I be wearied with the continuance, nor dismayed with the difficulty,
considering the malice and wickedness of mine adversaries, and my professed
enmity with them.

Secondly, I must always stand upon my guard, and be very watchful in every
action, seeing that whatsoever I do, they will seek to pervert it, and make it
offensive to God, even my very best endeavors.

Thirdly, I must never look to be free from some trouble or other, but knowing
my self to be a perpetual warfare, I must rather comfort my sell e with hope
of a glorious crown for my victories, then of any long or assured peace with
my enemies.

The fourth Foundation.
THe thing which these enemies endeavor to draw me to, is sin and offense to
God, which is so odious, hateful, and abominable, yt God does more detest and
dislike it, then he did the cruel usage, the wounds, the torments, and the
death it self, that for us he suffered of the Jews, and it makes our souls
more ugly then the plague, leprosy, or any other filthy disease does the
body.

Rules following this Foundation.
SO careful as I would be not to wound, torment, or murder Christ, so
careful must I be not to commit any mortal sin against him, yea and so much
more seeing that he hates sin more then death, having voluntarily fuffered
the one, and yet never committed the other.

Secondly, when I am tempted with any sin, let me examine my self, whether I
would buy the fulfilling of mine own appetite with being a Leaper, or full of
the plague, or with death presently to ensue after it. If not, then much less
ought I to buy it with the leprosy, loss, and death of my soul, which is of
far more worth then my body.

The fifth Foundation.
BEing Gods creature made to serve him in this life, my body, soul, and goods,
and all things any way pertaining unto me, are but lent, or only let me for
this end; and I am only a Bailife, Tenant, or officer, to demand or govern
these things to his best service, and therefore when the time of my stewardship
is expired, I shall be summoned by death to appear before my Landlord, who
with most rigorous justice, will demand account of every thing and creature of
his that has been to my use, yea of all that I have received, promised,
omitted, committed, lost, and robbed, and as I can then discharge this account,
so shall I be either crowned in eternal joy, or condemned to perpetual
damnation.

Rules following of this Foundation.
FIrst I must use all things in this life as another bodies goods, for which I
must be accountable to the uttermost farthing.

Secondly, the more I have, the greater and harder will be mine account of the
good use thereof, and therefore the more wary ought I to be in disposing of it.

Thirdly, let me often consider what bodily, ghostly, and external gifts of
God I have received, what in baptism and at other times I have promised, how
profitable and necessary good works I have omitted, how many grievous and
heinous sins I have committed, how often I have lost the grace of God, and my
right to heaven. Finally, how much honor, and how many souls I have robbed
from God. And these things being well perused, let me seek to make that
recompense and satisfaction for them, which I would wish to have made when
death shall summon me before my heavenly Judge, to give a most strict account
of them.

The fruit of these Foundations consists in the often considering of them,
as most necessary points, and as it were, the very first principles of good
life, upon the understanding and practicing whereof depends my progress in
virtue: and therefore I must very often read them, and examine my self whether
my mind and actions be answerable unto them.

How we ought to be affected toward God.
First of the consideration of Gods presence.
THese Foundations being laid, it behooves me further to descend to the notice
of my duty to God, my neighbor, and my self. And first concerning my duty
unto God, a very fit mean I can use to please him is to bear always in mind
his presence: for sure it is that as God, he is every where in substance,
power, and presence: as in him I live, move and am, as the Scripture says,
because he works with me in all my deeds, thoughts and words, in so much that
as the beam of the Sun, the heat of the fire or the wetnesse of the water,
so depend I of God; and should he but withdraw himself from me one moment, I
should forth with turn into nothing, and therefore it is a very forcible
means for my good, to do all things as if I did see God visibly working with
me in every action, as in truth he does, and knowing that what words, thoughts,
or deeds soever pass me, and what part of my body or mind soever I use, Gods
concourse and help thereunto is more then mine own, I must be afraid to use
them in any such thing, wherein I might offend him, but rather seek to do all
things, so that they be worthy of his presence, help, and assistance in them:
and if I can get a custom or habit to remember still the presence and
assistance of God* (as by use easily I may) I shall with due regard, reverence,
and consideration, abstain from such behavior as I think may be any way
offensive unto him: I shall also get a great facility in turning my mind and
heart to him, and in talking often with him by prayers which are the fuel of
devotion.

Other Affections that we ought to have unto God.
SEcondly, I must endeavor to to kindle in my self these affections toward
God.

The first Affection.
FIrst, of a sincere and tender love of him, as the fountain of all beauty
and felicity: of which love I may guess by these signs: By often thinking and
an earnest desire of God: by sorrow of his absence, and contentment in
consideration of his presence: By my diligence in performing without delay or
tediousness, that which pleases best my Savior, and by finding such comfort
in doing it, that it grieueth me, when for things of less value and goodness,
I am enforced to defer it.

By withdrawing all disordred love from all creatures, and especially my self,
and by loving nothing but in God, and for God: By seeking to increase this love
by consideration of Gods goodness, and his daily benefit: By taking delight in
Gods service, or things tending thereunto, not because I find contentment in
it, but because it is to Gods glory, to the which I would have all things
addressed.

By taking tribulations, or troubles of body or mind patiently, yea and with
joy, knowing that they come by Gods permission, and thinking them as favors,
which he affoordeth to his dearest friends.

The second Affection.
THe second affection, is a reverent and dutiful fear of God, which I may
gather by these signs: If when I remember the presence and majesty of God, I
frame both my body and mind to reverence and honor him with all humility and
decency, fearing lest by any unseemly and light behavior I should seem to be
contemptuous and careless of my duty toward him. If I find great fear to
do any thing that may displease God, not only mortally, but even venially, and
be withal ^^^y w^tchfull to avoid the least off^nce* lest any frailty (which
is great) should draw me to it; and so to farther inconvenience: If I fear to
be banished from him or forsaken for my sins, and endeavor* what I may to
prefer his love and favor toward me.

The third Affection.
THe third affection is zeal of Gods honor, and desire that he should be
duly served, and obeyed of all his creatures, of which I may judge by these
signs.

First, if I find a grief in my self, and am heartily fory when I see or
hear of other folks faults, or think on mine own, considering how by them a
base and wretched creature dishonoreth and displeases his Creator, in stead
of him serving his professed enemies, the flesh, the world and the devil.

The second sign is an earnest desire to help my neighbor, or mine own
soul out of sin by praying for this effect, and refusing no convenient
labor to accomplish the same, so that my Lord God be no more, or at least wise
offended then before.

The fourth Affection.
THE fourth affection is to endeavor as near as I can to take occasion of
every thing that I hear, see, or think of, to praise God: as if the things
were good, then to praise God that he gave grace to do them: and if the things
were evil, to thank God, that either he preserved me or others from them, or
at least has not suffered me to continue still in them, or to be in his wrath
condemned for them. Also I must consider, and with my inward eye see God in
every creature, how he works in all things to my benefit, and weigh how in
all creatures both within and without me, he shows his presence by keeping
them in their being, and course of nature, for without him they would presently
turn to nothing; and I must assure my self, that in all this he has as well
regard to my good as to others, and therefore all creatures must be (as it
were) books to me, to read therein the love, presence, providence, and
fatherly care that God has over me.

The fifth Affection.
THe fifth affection is, to consider, that I being a Christian, not only my
faith and all my actions proper thereunto, ought to be different from the
erroneous opinions, sects and actions of infidels, but even mine ordinary
actions of eating, drinking, playing, working, and such like, ought to have a
mark and badge of Christianity, and some difference from the like things done
by heathens: and this mark which makes Christian and good works, is a right
and sincere intention, which in every principal action I ought to procure, so
that it be done to the honor, glory, and service of God; and agreeable to the
rule of Christian duty, with that measure, temperance, and circumstance that
faith requires, persuading my self, that as well in these actions done in this
sort, as in others that carry more show of piety, God may be served and
honored, and therefore should it be a great negligence and carelessness in me
for want of directing my intention (which by use is easily gotten) to lose so
many great virtues, as by these ordinary actions I might daily and hourly
gain.

The sixth Affection.
THe sixth affection is a perfect resignation of my self into Gods hands, with
a full desire that he should use me as were most to his glory, whether it were
to my temporal comfort or no, and to be as ready to serve him in misery,
need, and affliction, as in prosperity and pleasure, thinking it my chiefest
delight, to be used as God will, and to have his pleasure and providence fully
accomplished in me, which is the end for which I was created, and for which I
do live. To attain this resignation, it is a very fit way to debate and
discourse with my self, what thing there is could happen unto me, though never
so much against my liking, which if it should fall out would trouble me, or
make me lose that indifferency which I ought to have in most willingly
yielding my self to whatsoever God shall lay upon me: and if I find any thing
which I think I should not well digest, nor accept with due patience, let me
endeavor to overcome my self in it, and by prayer and meditation seek to
win the difficulty thereof, that there may be nothing which I could not
willingly accept at Gods hands, how contrary soever it were to my inclination,
to which these considerations may help me.

First the end I aim at, is Gods glory in this world, and his reward in the
next: and therefore knowing that nothing but my voluntary sin can bar me
from this end, what need I much care by what means God will have me to attain
it? for the means can last but a little, and the end endures for ever, and is
so much the more comfortable, in that it has been atchiued with discomfortable
toils.

Secondly, God loves me more then I love my self, and is so wise that he sees
what is fittest for me, all present and future circumstances considered: he is
so mighty that what his wisdom and love shall conclude for my good his power
can put it in execution, and therefore let me yield my self rather to his
providence then to mine own desires.

Thirdly, whatsoever moves me to fear or dislike any thing, which I could not
frame my mind to bear, God sees it far better then I, yea and all other
secret and unknown hazards annexed to that thing. If therefore he knowing all
these things, will nevertheless let it happen unto me; I must assure my self
that it proceeds from love, and is for my greater good, and that he having
laid a heavy burden upon weak forces, will by his grace supply all my wants,
fears and frailties.

The seventh Affection.
THe seventh affection is gratitude and thankfulness, which I ought to find
in my self toward God, and the feeling an earnest desire to do any thing that
might counteruaile, or in part answer the excessive love that God has, and
does hourly bestow upon me, and to let no little good that I receive, though
never so ordinary, pass without thanks to him, who even in the least things
is content to serve me: and finally to make God my repose, and his remembrance
my comfort, and to loath all earthly things, as base and unpleasant in
comparison of him.

Of my duty toward my neighbor.
AFter knowledge of my duty toward God, I must consider my duty toward my
neighbor, and the manner how to demean and behave my self in company and
conversation First I must procure to remember, that my external behavior, my
gate, my gesture, my countenance, and my outward actions, be done with
gravity, modesty, and all decency, that I be not light, vain, or too lavish
in mirth, nor too austere, nor too much inclined to sadness, but with
temperate modesty rather composed to mirth then to melancholy. Which
external composition is necessary both for edifying our neighbor, who being
unable to judge or enter into our thoughts, judges of every one according to
that whereof his sense is witness. And next in respect of God, who being every
where present, requires in us behavior worthy of his sight and company: and
lastly, in respect of our own soul, this care of external decency being an
approved means to avoid infinite sins.

Of external composition there be three chief points. First the care of our
countenance, gate, and gesture: Secondly, of our voice and speech: Thirdly, of
our apparel and other adherents.

In countenance I must avoid an unstayed kind of variety and often change,
keeping as near as I may, one settled tenor thereof, rather bent to smiling
then heaviness, and free from frowning, and such like unseemly distemper:
neither ought I to alter countenance, but when reasonable and just cause moves
me to show either mirth, sorrow, dislike, or compassion, or some other modest
or temperate affection.

My gate ought to be grave, neither too swift, nor too slow, but with a mean
and sober pace: my gesture must be decent, free from affection or singularity,
and from all show of inward disquietnesse or unordered passion, which though I
cannot choose but sometimes feel, yet it is good (as much as I may) to conceal
it, because outward signs do feed the inward distemper and bewray to others
my imperfections, to my discredit and their evil ensample.

My voice neither ought to be very loud, nor my laughter so vehement, as to be
heard afar off, both seemly and modest; for excess in the voice, and
immoderate loudness, are always certain signs of passion, and therefore
ought not to be used but upon some extraordinary necessity. My speech ought
not to be so much as to make me be noted for talkatiue: yea it is good to be
rather sparing in words, and readier to hear then to speak: but when occasion
forces unto much talk, I must speak deliberatly without rashness or
leuitie, avoiding over many ieasts, especially bitter taunts, and sharp words:
I must also take heed of affected speech, and impertinent ceremonies, using
such affability, and convenient complements as common ciuility and usual
courtesy requires. Mine apparel must be free from lightness, or more
gaudinesse then fitteth mine age, company, or calling; it must be decent and
comely, not too open, nor with any unusual or new fashioned dresses, that
other grave persons of my quality and calling (that are well thought of) do
not use: it must be handsome and clean, and as much as may be, without
singularity, that therein the stayednesse and seemly estate of my soul may be
perceived. Always when I am to go to any company, either of my dwelling place
or strangers, I ought to forecast their disposition, and what talk or action
is likely to be tendered unto me by their presence. If I fear any detracting
speeches let me arm my self, not to seem to approve them, yea rather to
dislike them, and endeavor to turn their talk into some other matter, and so
in all unlawful kind of speech whatsoever.

Finally, let this for conversation be my chief rule, always to foresee and
provide my self against the occasions yt by every company are likely to be
offered me, and in the beginning to direct mine intention, to talk either for
dispatch of necessary business, (if there be any) or for maintaining mutual love
and charity, if it be merry or ordinary talk.

This foresight of occasions, and faults likely to be committed, is the
principal remedy against all sin, and therefore especially to be noted and
used. To conclude, the virtues necessary in conversation are, modesty,
decency, courtesy, affability, meekness, and civility, show of compassion
to others miseries, and of joy at their welfare, and of readiness to pleasure
all, and unwillingness to displease any: the want of any of these where
occasion requires, makes it more faulty.

The vices chiefly to be avoided, are pride, disdainfulness, rudeness,
frowardness, lightness, too much familiarity, churlishness, and offensive
speeches.

Of my duty toward my self.
THe last point is to consider my duty toward my self, and the care I ought
to have of mine own particular: first I must procure that which before is
mentioned, in all my actions to have a badge of Christianity, that is, a pure
and sincere affection, and intention, not seeking in any thing mine own
delights, pleasure, and contentment, more then may stand with the honor and
glory of God, remembering that I am to serve him, and not my self, more then is
necessary to enable me for his better service, I being his more then mine own.

Secondly, I must procure to foresee in every action (at least in all the
principal) to fore-arme my self against those occasions of sin that shall
be offered in them: and where it lies not in my power to avoid the occasion
of any great sin, the more danger there is: and the greater the sin is that
I am in danger of, so much the more preparation must I use to resist it, and
the more earnestly ask for Gods grace.

Thirdly, I must have care of my senses, as the means and entrance of
temptations, to which it is a principal help, not to be easily drawn with
every noise or fancy, to move my head or eyes, without there be good cause, nor
to be sudden in motion; and going hither and thither without deliberation I
must also remember well that the eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor the
ear with hearing novelties; and therefore must I needs bridle the unmeasurable
appetite of both these senses, by breaking off mine own desires in that
behalf.

Fourthly, because confusion, and an unsettled kind of life is the cause of many
sins and an enemy to all virtue, I must set down with my self some certain
order in spending my time, allotting in every how^e of the day some certain
thing to be done in the same, and to have times in the morning, evening, and
afternoon, devoted unto some good and godly exercise, which I must (though
not by vow) bind my self unto, when things of worldly affairs call me from
them: also to keep due times of rising, meals, and going to bed, and all
other necessary times the observation whereof is the most necessary for a
regular and virtuous kind of life.

Fifthly, it is a most necessary rule of good life, not only to keep order in
my spiritual and temporal actions, but also to persevere and continue in one
order, having once set it down with found advice: for the nature of man being
apt to change, we are given still to novelties, seeking new ways to
perfection, and confirming or habituating our selves in none. Wherefore (except
necessity, charity, or greater spiritual good do require) I must not flit
from one exercise to another, but first plant a good platform with mature
advice, and then resolve and fully determine to continue in the same.

Sixthly, I must not ^^mber my mind with many spiritual or external exercises
at once, nor labor my self too much at the first, for my force being
distracted to many offices, is the less able to perform any of them, and is
easily ouerlaboured without profit: wherefore I must not think to get all
virtues at once, or cut off all imperfections together, but having a general
resolution to get virtue, and leave all vice, begin with some one,
endeavoring to break my self of some one fault whereto I am most inclined,
and procuring to get the contrary virtue; for the care of avoiding one
offense, will make me take heed of all the rest.

Seventhly, man's nature being so corrupt, that without continual violence and
force, it cannot attain to virtue, or leave vice, whereunto it is much
inclined, I must assure my self that care and watchfulness is ever necessary,
and because I am apt to fall, I must often renew my good purposes, knowing that
I never can go on in virtue without falling, and therefore I must every morning
think with my self that hitherto I have done nothing, and that by Gods grace
that day I will begin afresh, as though it were the first day that ever I
began to do any good thing.

Eighthly, I must not make small account of little sins, nor be careless in
committing them, but always carry the mind that I would not offend God
willingly, even in the least sin, for any thing: and I must never think any
thing little, wherewith so high a Majesty is offended: for he that cares not
to commit little sins, gives the devil a great advantage to draw him into
greater.

Rules in sickness.
IF my sickness be great, I shall not need to force my self beyond my
strength unto any vocal prayers, more then in the morning dutifully to commend
my self unto God, with the Lords prayer, and the confession of Christian
faith, or if I cannot well say so much, now and then I must call upon God with
short prayers: as, Lord Jesus save me, Lord strengthen me, Lord grant me
patience, and such like, In sickness when I can bear it, it will be good
sometimes to have part of some good book read unto me, but not overmuch, for
fear of hurting my health. As in health I ought to be obedient to my
superiors, and by diligent observation show my duty toward God: so in
sickness I must be contented to be ruled by the Physicians, and such as have
care of me in things belonging to my bodily health: and I must persuade my
self, that in that time I have one chief rule to observe in being patient and
tractable, which in such a case does counteruaile the valor of all my usual
exercises. I must also assure my self that I do God good service when I do any
necessary thing and take any convenient recreation that may further my health.

I must take heed of being (...) or froward, which sickness for the most part
does cause, thinking that how much pain soever I suffer, Christ suffered far
more for my sake, and far more had I suffered ^^ng since in hell, if God had
dealt with me according to my deserts. It is good also to have my will and
testament in a readiness, before I fall into any extremity of sickness, that
a certain order be set down for all temporal matters, that I be not combred
with them when it stands me most upon to look to my soul.

Of the care of servants.
I Must see that they lie not out in the nights, but that I may know what
becomes of them: I must not keep such in my house as are swearers, liers,
gamesters, or such as are given to any notorious vice, unless there be great
likelihood and certain hope of their amendment. I must procure by what means
conveniently I may, that they have necessary instruction in matters
appertaining to the salvation of their souls. I must take special heed of any
secret meetings, messages, or more then ordinary liking between the men and
women of my family: I must see that the men have no haunt of women to their
chambers, lest lewdness be cloaked under some other pretense: I must have
great regard that my chiefest officers and men of most account be trusty
persons, of good life and example, because the rest will follow as they shall
lead them. I must seek as much as may be, that my servants be not idle, nor
suffered to use any great gaming, for by the one they shall fall into lewd
life, and by the other into swearing, unthriftiness, robbing, and such vices:
I must see that they have their wages at due times, lest for want they fall
into bad courses. When they do not their duties, I must rebuke them agreeable
to the quality of their fault, and not wink at great matters, lest they wax
careless and bold to do the like offenses again, yet must my rebukes be
tempered with gravity and mildness.

Of the care of Children.
I Must think that my Children so long as they are under age, and in my power
or custody, ought to be kept as my self, I having in this time to answer for
them. I must take heed that they come not amongst such servants as are like to
teach them to swear, or any other vice, and I must give special warning that
none do it. I must set honest and sound persons to govern them, that may also
teach them virtue and goodness, yet not trusting too much to my servants care,
but that I my self have a special eye over them, and take an account what
they do. I must use them to devotion by little and little, not cloying them
with too much at once, but rather seeking to make them take a delight in it. I
must instruct them in the points of faith, and true religion, and teach them
the Lords prayer, the Creed and the ten Commandments. I must keep them
always occupied in some profitable things, allotting them according to their
age, more or less time of recreation. I must oftentimes remember unto them the
passions and sufferings of Christ for sin, with the benefit of his death and
glorious resurrection. I must break them from their wills, and punish them as
they deserve: yet remembering also that they are young, and not keeping them in
too much subjection, which may breed in them base and servile minds, and make
their love less toward me: and I never ought to beat any child in mine
anger. I must procure that they be taught such exercises and qualities, as are
fit for those of their degree, and yet have chief care that good and honest
persons be about them. I must not use them to vain dresses, and costly
apparel, but rather often show them the vanity thereof, yet must they not be
too strait kept in that, or any other thing, which they are afterward to have,
lest the being too much barred from it make them more eager to have it, when
they come to enjoy it at their own will: I must use them to give alms, to
make much of the poor, and to use reverence to aged persons and spiritual
men: I must use them to read good books, such as are fittest for their
capacity, and see them kept from vain books of love, and such like idle
discourses, that do pervert the minds of youth oftentimes for all their ensuing
time after: I must hearten them as they grow in years, to suffer adversity,
and to digest grief, especially in Gods cause, and a good quarrel, telling
them the examples of others, and how good a thing patience and costancie is.

When they are fit to go to school, I must procure that they have discret and
calm teachers, such as are not cholerike, hasty, or cursed, lest they take
dislike and tediousness in learning; for they must be rather won unto it by
praise and emulation of others, then by bayting and stripes: I must see that
they be taught such civility, courtesy, and complements, as their degree and
the time requires, and frame them as much as may be, to be gentle, humble, and
affable, even to the meanest, rebuking them for angry and sharp words, or
disdainefull behavior, even to their inferiors: I must not suffer the boys
and girls to be much together, especially out of sight, after eight or nine
years of age, lest they fall to unhappiness: Likewise my daughters must not
be amongst the men, nor my sons amongst the women. When they come to such age
that they must of force be in many companies, I must procure some sound and
honest persons to be for the most part with them, to inform me of their
courses. I must make them in any wise to beware of lewd conversation, which is
the overthrow of youth, and therefore cause this point to be beaten into them
by good and zealous men. I must never assure or marry them, until they be of
sufficient age to make their own choice, and frame their liking: neither force
them to any match, lest they curse me all their lives after, as it often
happens.

An order how to spend every day.
IN time of health hours of going to bed and rising, may be either nine and
five, or ten and six, or according to the strength or weakness of every man's
body, so they be certain. After I am up, for a good pretty space, it is good
not to talk, but at the least for half a quarter of an hour to busy my
mind in prayer and meditation, and then afterward to talk if need require,
because my business with God being greater then with any man, it is fit that
he should be first talked with of matters concerning my soul, and then others
of worldly things. I must procure to go ^eately and handsome in my attire,
agreeable to my calling, and to avoid all kind of vndecencie, which breeds
dislike, and contempt, and does rather offend then please God.

When I am ready, I must go to my prayers appointed, and before I set my self
to pray, I must call to mind what I promised to do for any at that time, of
what other necessary business I have then to dispatch, and I must keep touch
in my words in the least things, cutting off occasions of being interrupted, as
near as I may. In prayer I must consider the presence of God, not speaking
unto him carelessely or negligently, but think a few prayers well said, better
and more acceptable, then many hastily shuffled over: and I must not omit to
remember the joys of heaven, the pains of Hell, mine own death, and the
death of Christ for me. After prayer I must go about some exercise of work
agreeable to my faculty and vocation, such as may be of some profit, having an
especial respect above all things to sequester idleness, the parent of all
vice. When I go to dinner, I must think and consider for what end I am to
eat, which i^ to help and strengthen nature, and to make my self able to
serve my Creator and feeder, not to content mine own appetite: I must learn
my little children (if I have any) to say some godly grace, or at the least
perform that duty of thanksgiving my self. When I am set, before I lay hand
to my trencher, I may pause a while, and desire God to give me temperance and
mindfulnesse of his presence.

At meals I must neither be too curious or doubtful of what I eat, neither
precise in the quantity, finenesse or coursenesse of the meat, but of that
which God has sent, take a competent meal, measurable to my need, and not
hurtful to my health. After dinner I must thank God for his gifts, remembering
the end why he has fed me is, that I should be the better able to serve him, I
must also think that many have wanted that sufficiency which I have had, and
would be glad to accept of my leauings, and therefore I ought to have care and
regard to the poor, procuring something for them, and sometimes seeing them
served my self, considering Christ in their persons. If I have strangers, I
may keep them company, and talk friendly and merrily with them as occasion
shall serve, directing my behavior agreeable to virtuous conversation: and
having this intention in my talk, that amity and love may be maintained, and
all breach and unkindness avoided. I must if time and place will permit me, be
always doing some profitable thing, to avoid sloth, directing mine intention
in all mine exercises, to this end, that I may avoid idleness and
temptations, bestowing my time in good sort to Gods glory. After dinner I must
call to mind whether I have any promise to perform, or any other business to
do that is not ordinary, that I neither forget the thing, nor time appointed
for it. It is good for me sometimes to go about the rooms of the house to see
that they be kept clean and handsome, thinking that God is delighted with
cleanenesse both bodily and ghostly, and detesteth sluttishnesse, as a thing
which he permits for a punishment of sin, and one of the scourges of hell.
A little before supper it will be good to read part of some godly book,
procuring to take some benefit by it, and continuing in one book till I have
read it over, and then begin a new. I must by watchfulness avoid all
offense to God, leaving him in one exercise to serve him in another, as he
appoints me occasions. When I sit down to supper, I must remember what my
intention ought to be, and to take the same course which is prescribed for
dinner. After supper I may talk as occasion shall serve, or employ my time in
reading of a godly book. Toward the hour of my going to bed, I must examine
my self, first whether my promises and appointments concerning extraordinary
business be performed, or if I have forgotten any necessary thing, I must take
order to remember it, that I forget it not the second time. This done, I must
examine my conscience concerning the thoughts, words, and deeds of that day;
and especially touching the purposes that I have made in the morning, and how I
have observed my godly determination, and what faults I have committed of any
moment. After I have examined my conscience, and said my prayers, it is good to
abstain from talk that night (unless some just occasion require the
contrary) that my mind may be free from idle thoughts when I go to sleep.

Of Temptations.
FIrst I must learn to know when I am tempted, for if I can find my
temptation, I may reckon it half overcome: for if I have fear of God, or care
of my soul, I cannot but arm my self earnestly to resist, knowing that
temptation proceeds from an enemy, to whom I have resolved by Gods grace,
never to consent, what misery or trouble soever I endure.

How to know temptations and good motion.
IT is always a spiritual desolation original and proceeding from the
devil, when it darkeneth and disquieteth the mind, awaketh and stirs up
our passions, when it draws to external and earthly solaces, leaving in the
mind a tediousness and unwillingness to prayer and other works of devotion.
Also when it diminishes our affiance and taust in God, and drives to a
despair in Gods mercy, or perseuering in his service, making it seem an
irksome and impossible thing, and moving us to forsake it: and when I find my
self troubled in this sort, I must assure my self without all doubt, that I
am then tempted by the Devil, and therefore arm my self to resist him by
doing that which those temptations dissuade me from. On the other side, comfort
which is caused by Gods Spirit, is known by these signs: It incenseth the
mind by a quiet and calm motion to the love of God, without any inclination
to any creatures love more then for Gods only glory, and it breeds a kind of
inward light and brightness, whereby for the time the mind sees after a most
effectual sort, the necessity, profit, and true comfort that is in Gods
service, conceiving a contempt and dislike of worldly delights, and tasting
that which is the greatest felicity in this life, that is, so assured
contentment in being in Gods grace, and seeking to please him, yt it then
judges no contentment in the world like or comparable unto it, as in truth
there is none. Also true spiritual comfort brings a delight and desire to
think of the benefits of God, the joys of heaven, the comfort of meditation,
and talking with God.

Finally, it confirms our faith, quickens our hope, and increases
charity, fu^nishing the mind with a sweet taste of joy, quiet and free from
all combers. Sometimes the devil transformeth himself into an Angel of
light, and at the first when he knows our good desires and purposes, he
seems to sooth us in them, and to set us forward toward the performance
thereof, but in the end he seems to draw us to his byas, and by corrupting
our intention, or by perverting the manner, time, or other circumstance of the
due execution, makes the whole action worthless and faulty, though otherwise
virtuous in it self.

There must be great heed taken in the beginning, middle and end of our
thoughts: for when either at the first or at the last it tends to apparent
sin, or withdraws from the greater good, or tends to courses of less
piety, or more danger then we are in, or if it disquiet the mind, bereauing
it of the wonted calm and love of virtue, it is a sign that the Devil was
beginner of it, whose property is to hinder good, and withdraw us to evil.
When in any suggestion I find the serpent by his sting, that is, Satan by the
wicked end he moves me unto, it is good to untwist and reuerse his motion, and
to look backward even unto the beginning, and to mark what plausible color
he first pretended, that the next time I may the better spy his cunning and
subtle dealings and drifts.

How to behave our selves in time of temptation.
IN the time of my desolation, and disquiet of mind, I must not enter into any
deliberation, or go about to alter any thing concerning the state of my soul,
or purposed course of life, but per^euer in my former resolutions made in time
of my good and quiet estate, wherein I was free from passion, and better able
to judge of things convenient for my good: yet may I, and ought to resolve upon
such helps as are fit to resist and repel my discontented thoughts, (so they
be not prejudicial to my former purposes) as prayer, repentance, and
confession of my sins, with such like remedies. In temptations and troubles
of mind, I must remember that before time I have had the like, and they have in
the end passed, leaving me very glad and joyful when I have resisted them, and
sorrowful when I yielded too much unto them, and therefore I must think that
these also must pass after a while, and I shall feel the like joy in having
resisted and overcome them: and in the mean time I must with patience endure
the comber and trouble of them, assuring my self that God therewith is highly
pleased, and the enemy most effectually subdued. Neither the multitude,
continuance, nor badnesse of any thought must breed any scruple or disquiet in
me: for not to have them is not in my power, but only not to consent unto
them: and so long as with deliberation I have not consented, nor willingly, or
with delight stayed in them, I have not sinned any more then if I had only had
them in a dream: If before I had evil thoughts, I had a resolute mind never
to yield to any mortal sin, and afterward when I remember my self, and mark
that I was in a bad thought, I still find the same resolution, it is a sign
that in the time of my distraction and bad imagination, I did not willingly
consent or offend in them; neither is it like but my mind being so well
affected, I should have easily remembered dir^ctly and without doubt, if I had
yielded farther then I ought. Desolations are permitted of God for three
causes: First for a punishment of our sins, remissness and coldness in Gods
service. Secondly, to try whether we be true servants of God, or only
hirelings that are willing to labor no longer then they receive the hire and
stipend of present comfort. Thirdly, to ascertaine us, that it passes the
reach and compass of our ability, either to attain or to maintain in us the
fervor of devotion, the intensiue love of God, the abundance of godly tears,
and other spiritual graces and comforts, which we must acknowledge to proceed
from Gods mere liberality, not of our own force or desert. It is good while I
feel the sweetness of Gods visitation and presence, to fortify my self
against the desolations that will ensue, and remembering those that are past, to
think that all troubles will as well pass as comforts, and that our whole
life is but a continual succession and mixture of sorrow and joy, the one
always ouertaking the other, and neither of them continuing long together: and
therefore I must settle my mind in a kind of indefferencie unto them both, as
it shall please God to send them.

First, to know it is a thing coming from my mortal enemy, and tends to my
eternal destruction. To look for temptations before hand, and not to think
them novelties, but necessary sequels of our hostility with the devil, with
whom we must never be friends.

To resist them stoutly at the first, and to crush the serpent in the head, for
nothing makes the devil to become so furious and violent, or to redouble his
suggestions, as to perceive the soul dismayed with his temptations, or not
expecting (by the confidence in Gods help and mercy) an assured victory. To
bear patiently the multitude and continuance of them, assuring my self that
they will have an end ere long.

To think on the joy I shall have for not consenting unto them, and the crown
of glory that I shall enjoy. To remember how often I have been as grievously
annoyed with the like, and yet by Gods help have given the devil the foil.
Not to strive with unclean temptations, but to turn my mind to think of
other matters, and to change place or work, or to find some way to put me out
of those fantasies. To resist vices by practicing and doing acts of the
contrary virtues. To arm my self before hand, by getting those virtues that
are opposite to such vices as I am most inclined unto: for in those does the
devil always seek his advantage to overthrow me.

In my extremest troubles to humble my self in the sight of Almighty God,
acknowledging mine own weakness; and wholly relying upon his help most
earnestly in word and heart call for his assistance, firmly trusting in his
mercy, yea and offering my self (so as he forsake me not) to suffer these and
all other whatsoever it shall please God to permit, even so long as he shall
think good to inflict them, for of all other things this most ouercometh the
Devil, when he sees we turn his evil motions and troubles to so glorious
and great a victory.

A prayer in temptation.
O Merciful Jesus, the only refuge of desolate and afflicted souls: O Jesus
that have made me and redeemed me, in whom all things are possible unto me, and
without whom I am able to do nothing: thou see who I am, that here prostrate
my prayers, and pour out my heart unto thee. What I would have, and what is
fit for me thou know. My soul is buried in flesh and blood, and would feign
be dissolved and come unto thee. I am urged against my will, and violently
drawn to think that which from my heart I detest, and to have in mind the
poison and bane of my soul. O Lord thou know my mould and making, for thy
hands have framed me, and with flesh and skin thou have clothed me. And lo
this flesh which thou have given me, draws me to my ruin, and fights
against the spirit: If thou help not (o gracious aid) I am overcome and
vanquished. If thou forsakest me I must needs faint, with all discouragement.
Why do thou set me contrary unto thee, and make me grievous and a burden
to my self? Did thou create me to cast me away? Did thou redeem me to
damn me for ever? It had been good for me never to have been borne, if I were
borne to perish. Oh most merciful father, where are thy old and wonted
mercies? where is thy gracious sweetness and love? How long shall mine enemies
rejoice over me, and humble my life upon earth, and place me in darkness like
the dead of the world? What am I o Lord that thou set me to fight alone
against so mighty, subtle, and cruel enemies, that never cease to bid me a
perpetual battle? O Lord why do thou show thy might against a leaf, that
is tossed with every wind, and persecutest a dry stubble? Will thou therefore
damn the work of thy hands? Will thou throw me from thy face, and take thy
holy spirit from me? Alas o Lord whither shall I go from thy face? or whither
shall I fly from thy spirit? whither shall I fly from thee incensed, but to
thee appeased? whither from thee as just, but unto thee as merciful? Do with
me Lord that which is good in thine eyes, for thou will do all things in
righteous judgment: only remember that I am flesh and blood, frail of my
self and impotent to resist. Show thy self a Savior unto me, and either take
away mine enemies, or grant me such a supply of thy grace to enable my
defects, that without wound or fault* by thee and with thee, I may overcome
them, sweet Jesus. Amen.

A godly devout prayer.
O Gracious Lord, and sweet Savior, give me a pure intention, a clean heart,
and a regard to thy glory in all my actions: Possess my mind with thy
presence, and ravish it with thy love, that my delight may be to be embraced in
the arms of thy protection. Be thou light unto mine eyes, music to mine
ears, sweetness to my taste, and contentment to my heart. O Jesus I give thee my
body, my soul, my substance, my fame, my friends, my liberty and life,
dispose of me and all that is mine, as shall be most to thy glory: I am not
mine, but thine, therefore claim me as thy right, keep me as thy charge, love
me as thy child, fight for me when I am assaulted, heal me when I am wounded,
revive me when I am spiritually killed, receive me when I fly, and let me
never be quite confounded: give me patience in trouble, humility in comfort,
constancy in temptations, and victory against my ghostly enemies: grant me
good Father modesty in countenance, gravity in my behavior, deliberation in
my speeches, purity in my thoughts, and righteousness in mine actions. Be my
sunshine in the day, my food at the table, my repose in the night, my clothing
in nakedness, and my succor in all needs. Let thy blood run in my mind as
a water of life, to cleanse the filth of my sins, and to bring forth the
fruit of life everlasting. Stay mine inclinations from beating down my soul:
bridle mine appetites with thy grace, and quench in me the fire of all
unlawful desires. Make my will pliable to thy pleasure, and resigned wholly to
thy providence, and grant me perfect contentment in that which thou allottest:
Strengthen me against occasions of sin, and make me steadfast in not yielding
to evil, yea rather to die then to offend thee. Lord make me ready to pleasure
all, loath to offend any, loving to my friends, and charitable to mine enemies.
Forsake me not lest I perish: leave me not to mine own weakness, lest I fall
without recovery. Grant me an earnest desire to amend my faults, to renew my
good purposes, and to perform my good intentions. Make me humble to my
superiors, friendly to my equals, charitable to my inferiors, and careful to
yield due respect to all sorts. Lastly, grant me sorrow for my sins,
thankfulness for thy benefits, fear of thy judgments, love of thy mercies,
and mindfulnesse of thy presence. Amen.

Considerations to settle the mind in the course of Virtue.
THe first consideration: How weighty a thing the business of man's soul is.
Whosoever being desirous to take due care of his soul, commencing a spiritual
course, must consider that he has taken such a business in hand, that for
importance, necessity and profit, summoneth all other traffickes and affairs
of the world, yea, and to which only all other business ought to be
addressed, for herein our menage is about the salvation of our soul, our
chief jewel and treasure, of which if in the short passage of our brittle and
uncertain life we take not the due care that we ought for a whole eternity
after, we shall evermore repent and be sorry for it, and yet never have the
like opportunity again to help it.

Secondly, the better to conceive the moment and weight of this business, let
us consider what men use to do for their bodily health: for we see they make so
principal a reckoning of it, they spare no cost, nor toil, nor leave any
thing unattempted that may avail them to attain it. They suffer themselves to
be launced, wounded, pined, burnt with red hot irons, besides diverse other
extreme torments only for this end. How much greater miseries ought we to
endure? how much greater pains and diligence ought we to employ for this
health of our soul, which is to survive when the body is dead, rotten, and
devoured with worms? And to survive in such sort, that it must be perpetually
tormented in hell with intolerable torments, or enjoy endless felicity in
heaven: And therefore of how much greater worth and weight we think the soul,
and the eternal salvation or damnation thereof, then the momentarie health or
sickness of our bodies, so much greater account and esteem ought we to make
of the business of our soul, then of any other worldly or bodily affair
whatsoever.

For what avails it a man (says Christ) to gain the whole world, and make
wrack of his soul? If therefore we keep diverse men for diverse offices about
our body, and many thousands do live by serving and providing things for every
part thereof: If we spend so much time in feeding, refreshing, and reposing the
same: If the greatest portion of our revenues (be they never so large) be
consumed in the meats, pomp, sports, and pleasures thereof, how much more
ought we to seek as many helps, services and purueyers for our soul, for
whose only sake our body was given, and of whose good the welfare of the body
only proceeds? Thirdly, the necessity and poise of this care of our soul
may be gathered of this, that all other matters are entreated with men, or some
other creatures, but this business of our soul with God himself, who, by how
much he is nobler and worthier then any of his creatures, so much more is the
weight of this matter, and cannot be dealt with any without him: and so much
more diligence ought there to be employed therein, especially in this time
wherein God is still ready to further our endeavors in this behalf, whereas
when time is expired, condemn he may for our negligence, or reward us for our
carfulness, but not help us any more to alter the state of our soul, be it
never so miserable.

Fourthly, we may gather how material and important this matter is, by the
life of Christ and his Saints, who withdrawing themselves from all other
worldly affairs, thought it work enough to attend to this business of the
soul: and whosoever at this day are honored in Gods Church, they are honored
only in this, that they have with a glorious conclusion happily and
constantly, accomplished this business to Gods glory and their own
salvation: and who so considers the intolerable torm^^ts of Martyrs, the
painful agonies, conflicts, rough storms, and troubles of all Gods Saints,
and does remember withal, that they undertook them for no other respect, but
only for the better bringing this business of their soul to an end, it will
soon appear how weighty a thing and how precious the salvation of the soul
is, which they did think nothing too dear bought with all the miseries,
sorrows and pains that this world could afford. Let us also consider that
whatsoever moved them to such care and earnestness in this behalf, has no
less place in us doubtless then in them, seeing that our soul is as dear
bought, as much worth, and created to as great glory as theirs: the danger of
our salvation rather more, then any way less then theirs. God has as much
right in us as in th^^, and we as many titles of bond and duty to serve him as
they. Finally we are assaulted by the same enemies, environed with the like
hazardes, and subject to as many, yea more occasions of sin, and allurements
to damnation then they. Who therefore sees not that we are in every respect to
account the care of our souls as important and necessary to us as ever it
has been to any? Wherefore let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor the
strong man in his might, nor the rich man in his riches, says God by his
Prophet Jeremy 9. But let him that glories, glory in this, that he knows
me, for I am the only Lord that works mercy, judgment, and justice upon the
earth, and these things please me, says the Lord. As who would say, it is
folly and vanity to glotie and rejoice in any other thing then in the
knowledge and service of God, and procuring mercy and mild judgment for our
souls.

The second Consideration. How we ought to arm our minds against temptations
that happen when we seek earnestly to serve God.
FIrst, seeing this business of our soul is of so great moment, he that
earnestly goes about the same must offer himself up unto God, and be most
ready to endure constantly all the dangers, combers and difficulties that shall
happen, and resolve never by Gods grace to be dismayed and beaten back from
his purpose by any trouble or encounter whatsoever, knowing that glorious and
honorable enterprises can never be achieved without many contradictions.
Wherefore let him persuade himself that when he has settled his mind seriously
to follow this business, Hell it self, and all the enemies of God and man's
soul will conspire against him: The flesh to allure him to delights of the
senses, and to recall to the vomit of his abandoned pleasures: The world to
entice him with pompes and vanities, with ministering occasion of sin, and
provoking by evil examples: Yea, if that will not serve, by terrifying him
with persecutions, extortions, obloquies, slanders, and torments, and with all
kind of disgrace. Finally, the devil (a professed enemy to all that take
care of their souls) will seek to entrap him with a thousand trains,
passions, and subtle temptations, leaving nothing that he thinks may remove
a man from these endeavors, tending to his salvation.

Secondly, the case standing thus, let that saying of Scripture come to our
mind: My son coming to the service of God, stand in justice and fear, and
prepare thy soul unto temptation. Wherefore he that enters into the way of
life, must remember that he is not come to a play, pastime, or pleasure, but to
a continual rough battle and fight, against most unplacable enemies. And let
him resolve himself, never in this world to look for quiet and peace, no not
so much as for any truce for a moment of time, but arm himself for a
perpetual combat, and rather think of a multitude of happy victories (which
by Gods grace he may attain) then of any repose or quietness from the rage
and assaults of his enemies. Let him see and peruse the pattern of his
Captains course, who from his birth to his death was in a restless battle,
persecuted in his swathling cloutes by Herod, annoyed the rest of his infancy
by banishment, wandering and need: In the flower of his age, slandered, hated,
pursued, whipped, crucified, and most barbarously misused. In the same sort
were all his Apostles, and all his principal soldiers handled: for whom he
loves he chastises, and proves like gold in the furnace. And therefore no
man must think it a new thing to be tempted and troubled when he once runs
a virtuous course, contrary to the liking of his enemies. For, The Disciple is
not above his master, nor the servant above his Lord: who as we see had the
same entreaty.

Thirdly, lest we should be agaste and discouraged at the expectation and fear
of so many discomforts, and the incessant malice of so spiteful enemies, let
us remember the words of Elizeus, That more stand with us then against us.
Against the corruption of nature we have grace. Against the Devil we have God,
who will never suffer us to be tempted above our force and strength: Against
the power of hell we have the prayers of the faithful: Against the miseries of
the body we have the spiritual comfort of the mind, which God allotteth in
such measure as our necessity requires: and if there were nothing else, this
were enough to make troubles welcome in this case, for that thereby we purchase
an inestimable glory (for a short passing combat) the comfort whereof neither
eye has seen, ear has heard, nor any heart conceived. And on the other
side, by the same we avoid other intolerable and eternal torments of hell,
the least whereof passes all those that can be suffered in the world, and
therefore is our change most happy, that by the pain of a short life, avoid
the misery of an eternal death, and deserve the unspeakable happiness of the
life everlasting. For this cause (says Saint James) Think you it all joy my
brethren, when you shall fall into diverse temptations, knowing that the trial
of your faith works patience, and patience has a perfect work, that you may
be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.

The third Consideration. Of the watchfulness and attention required in the
care of our soul.
SEeing this weighty affair of our souls health, is hemmed in and beset with
so manifest perils and troubles, it stands us upon most watchfully to take
heed to every thought, word, and deed, that passes, lest through the number
and subtilties of enemies trains, we be often entrapped: for it is hard to
touch pitch and not be defiled, to live in flesh a spiritual life, to converse
in the world without worldly affections. Wherefore as a Legate that is to
deliver his embassage before a great presence of Peers and Nobles, has not
only regard to his matter, but also to his words, voyee, and actions, that all
be suitable to his message: so we having to work this exploit of our soul
before God and all the court of heaven, and also before the eyes of those that
lay wait to take us in any trippe, ought to be very wary, even in our least
thoughts and deeds, for fear lest we offend the presence of God, and give
occasion of triumph and victory unto our deadly foes. And for this says the
Scripture: Keep thy self very watchfully.

Secondly, to attain this diligent and attentive care in all our actions: let
us consider what men use to do that carry great treasure by places haunted with
thieves, how warily they look to their way, how often they turn about them;
how many times they prepare themselves, sometimes to fight, and other whiles to
run away. Likewise how warily he walks, and how careful he is never to
stumble nor fall that carries in each hand a thin glass of precious liquour,
through stony and rough places: and when we have marked these men's carfulness
in these inferior matters, let us remember that much more respect is necessary
in us, whose treasure is more precious then any worldly jewels, and yet do we
carry it in earthen and frail vessels, in the midst of so many thieves as
there are passions and disordered appetites in us, as there are Devils in wait
for us, and as there are stumbling stones and occasions of sin set round
about us to procure this attention: the most effectual helps are these.

First to think how careful we should be to do all things well, if this
present day were the last that ever we should live in this world (as
peradventure it may be) and that at the end thereof we were to be conuented
before a most severe and rigorous Judge, who according to the desert of that
days actions, should pass the sentence of life or death upon us.

Secondly, to remember that God is in his own substance, power, and true
presence in every place, and sees both our outward and inward actions more
then we our selves, and therefore let us seek in every thing so to behave our
selves, that we fear not to have God a witness and beholder of all that we
do, think, or say, and let us ask him grace to do nothing unworthy his fight.

Thirdly, we must consider the carelessness of our life past, remembering how
often we have fought against God with his own weapons, and abused the force
that he has affoorded, in every part of our body and mind: and therefore as
Saint Paul warns, As we have exhibited our members to serve uncleanness and
iniquity, so let us now exhibit our members to serve justice unto
sanctification.

Fourthly, to procure this attention, it is good oftentimes in the day when we
ate about our ordinary actions, to use godly prayers, and some verses out of
the Psalms, with petition unto God for his grace, aid and assistance: for
such godly exercises are fuel of devotion, causes of attention, food of the
soul, preparatiues against temptations, and assured helps to attain any
virtues. Therefore it is good to use them in lieu of sightes, and in the
beginning of every chief action, directing therein our intention and action,
to Gods glory and service, and our own fowls good health and fafetie.

The last Consideration. Of the necessity of perseverance in continuing
watchful over our selves.
FIrst seeing the sum and complement of all virtue consists in the
continuance and progress of it, perseverance of all other things is most
necessary in this business, to the better attaining whereof these
considerations may prevail. First to consider by whose instinct and motion I
began to take special care of my soul, and I shall find that being a thing
contrary to the inclination of flesh and blood, and above the reach of nature,
to resolve upon so painful and wary a course, in hope of a reward and joy
that faith does promise, that I say, God only and no other was the Author and
moouer of my heart unto it, and therefore unless I mean directly to resist
God, and run a contrary course to that which he prescribes, I must resolve
my self to persevere unto the end, in that which I have happily begun.

Secondly, the end of this enterprise was to serve God, to bewail my former
sins, and to work by Gods help the salvation of mine own soul: and when I
resolved upon these means I was free from passion, and as well able to choose
things convenient as I could at any other time, and wholly bent to do that
thing which was for my greatest good. Wherefore seeing I can never aim at a
better end, nor be in better plight to make a sounder choice, my surest way is
to persevere still in my resolution to the end, never altering my designment
unless it be to further my course.

Thirdly, I must consider who is that, that would make me forsake it: for if
God moved me unto it, doubtless it is the Devil would move me from it, for
God cannot be contrary to himself, neither uses he to alter our minds, but
only from evil to good, or from good to better: therefore unless I mean to
yield willingly to the Devil, and to follow mine enemies counsel to mine own
perdition, I must persevere unto the end: for with what pretext soever the
Devil seeks to cover his motion, sure it is that his drift is to draw me
from God and goodness, and to damn my soul: for how can he intend any thing
for my good, that bears me such a cankred malice, that he cares not to
increase his own pain, so that he may work me any spiritual, yea or
corporal harm.

Fourthly, I must print that saying of Christ in my mind: He that perseuereth
unto the end shall be saved: for not he that begins, nor he that continues
for a month, or a year, or a short time, but only he that perseuereth unto
the end of his life shall be saved.

Wherefore the same cause that moved me to begin, ought also to move me to
continue, that the reward and crown of my good resolution be not cut off by
any want of perseverance. Let not the cries of mine enemies move me: let me
with Saint Paul say, The world is crucified to me, and I to the world: And with
David, It is good for me to clean unto God. Finally, let me imitate the
ensample of Christ, that perseuered on the cross unto death for my sake,
though often called upon to come down.

Fifthly, I must consider that in what state so ever of grace, or merit of
damnation I begin the next life, I must and shall undoubtedly persevere in it
according to the words of Solomon: Wheresoever the tree falls there shall it
be, whether it be toward South or North, that is, toward heaven or hell: for
both the pain of this continues for ever, and the joy of the other is also
everlasting.

If therefore I will persevere in heaven, let me persevere in the way that
leads unto it, and never forsake the painfulness of it unto the iourneyes
end. The passions of this life are not condign and comparable to the future
glory: and it is extreme folly for avoiding a short and transitory pain,
to hazard the loss of everlasting joy, and put my self in peril of
perpetual bondage, in sarre more extreme and endless torments. The sinners
persevere still in wickedness, and service of the Devil. The worldlings
persevere in pursuing vanities, and following the world, yea and that with most
servile toil, and base drudgerie, and not without many bodily and ghostly
harms: how much more ought a true servant of God persevere in Gods service, and
not seem by forsaking him in the way, to condemn him for a worse master then
the world or the Devil, whom many thousands serve to the end, to their own
damnation. Let me remember that the first Angel for want of perseverance
became a devil. Adam for want of the same was thrust out of Paradise, and
Judas of an Apostle became a prey of hell. Finally, there be many thousands in
hell fire burning, that began very good courses, and for a time went forward
in the same, and yet in the end, for want of perseverance were damned for ever.

What good a soul loses by mortal sin
THe grace of the holy Ghost.

The friendship and familiarity with God.

All moral virtues infused, and gifts of Gods Spirit.

The inheritance of the kingdom of heaven.

The portion of Gods children, and patronage of his fatherly providence, which
he has over the just.

The peace and quietness of a good and quiet conscience.

Many comforts and visitations of the holy Ghost.

The fruit and merits of Christ's death and passion.

What misery the soul gains by mortal sin.
COndemnation to eternal pain.

To be quite cancelled out of the book of life.

To become of the child of God the thrall of the devil.

To be changed from the temple of the holy Ghost into a den of thieves, a
nest of vipers, and a sink of all corruption.

How a Soul is prepared to justification by degrees.
Faith sets before one eyes God as a just Judge.

Angry with the bad. Merciful to the repentant.
Of this faith by the gift of Gods Spirit, arises a fear by consideration of
Gods justice. and Our own^ sins.


This fear is comforted by hope grounded in Gods mercy, and the Merits of
Christ.


Of this hope arises love and charity to Christ for Loving us without desert,
Redeeming us with so many torments.


Of this love follows sorrow for offending Christ, of whom we have been so
mercifully Created, Redeemed, Sanctified, Called to by Faith.


Of this sorrow arises a full purpose to avoid all sin, which God above all
things detesteth. The devil above all things desires. Above all things
hurts the soul.


A short Meditation of man's miseries.
What was I O Lord? what am I? what shall I be? I was nothing, I am now
nothing worth, and am in hazard to be worse then nothing: I was conceived in
original sin: I am now full of actual sin: I may hereafter feel the
eternal smart of sin: I was in my mother a loathsome substance: I am in the
world a sack of corruption: I shall be in my grave a prey of vermin. When I
was nothing, I was without hope to be saved, or fear to be damned, I am now in
a doubtful hope of the one, and in a manifest danger of the other. I shall be
either happy by the success of my hope, or most miserable by the effect of my
danger. I was so that I could not then be damned: I am so that I can scarce be
saved: what I have been I know (to wit) a wretched sinner: what I am I cannot
say, being uncertain of Gods grace: what I shall be I am ignorant of, being
doubtful of my perseverance. O Lord erect my former weakness, correct my
present sinfulness: direct my future frailty from passed evil to present
good, and from present good to future glory, sweet Jesus.

A devout prayer to desire pardon and remission of our sins.
O Most mighty Lord and Creator of all things, when I think with my self how
grievously I have offended thine infinite Majesty with my sins, I wonder at
mine own folly: when I consider what a loving and bountiful father I have
forsaken, I accurse mine ingratitude: when I behold how I am fallen from such a
noble liberty into such a miserable bondage, I condemn my self for an
inconstant fool, and know not what other thing I may set before mine eyes, but
only hell and damnation for so much as thy justice (from which I cannot fly)
puts a great tetror into my conscience: but contrariwise when I consider thy
great mercy, which (as the Prophet witnesses) exceeds all thy works, then
do I feel forthwith a fresh and pleasant air of hope, to refresh and
strengthen again my weak and sorrowful soul. Wherefore should I then
despair to obtain pardon of him who has so often times in the holy
Scriptures invited sinners to repentance, saying* I desire not the death of a
sinner, but that he should live and be converted. Moreover, thine only
begotten Son, our sweet Savior Jesus Christ has revealed unto us by many
parables, how ready and willing thou art to grant pardon unto all such as are
penitent for their sins. This he signifies unto us by the Jewel lost, and
found again. By the strayed sheep brought home again upon the shepherds
shouldiers: and much more by the comparison of the prodigal son, whose
lively image I do acknowledge in my self, for I am he that has most unjustly
forsaken thee, my loving father, and have riotously consumed my substance, and
by obeying the appetites of my flesh, have disobeyed thy commandments, and by
breaking of them, have fallen into the most filthy prison of sin, being
brought to extreme misery, out of which I know none other that can help me,
but only thou my Almighty God, whom I have forsaken. Receive therefore (O
Lord) mercifully the humble, that desires pardon of thee, whom thou have so
patiently looked for, even until this present hour. Alas I am not worthy to
lift up mine eyes unto thee, nor once to call thee father, but for so much as
thou art a true father in deed, may it please thee to view me with thy fatherly
compassionate eyes, for thy only sight is powerful to raise the dead, and it
is that which causes all those that wander out of the way to return again to
themselves. For this repentance and sorrow for my sins I had not had, if thou
had not beheld me with thy mercies eye. When I went wandering afar off from
thee, thou did look down even from heaven upon me, and did open mine eyes
that I might see my self, and take a view how full fraught I was with infinite
sins, and even at this instant thou come to receive me again, giving me
knowledge and mindfulnesse of mine innocence which I have lost. I do not
request thy most sweet embracings and kisses: nor the rich garment that was
wont to cloth me: neither yet the ring of mine ancient dignity: I sue not to
be received again into the state and dignity of thy sons: but thou shall do
very much for me, in case it may please thee to number me amongst thy
bondslaues, and so to mark me with thy sign, and to fetter me with thy
chains, that I may never after run away from thee.

Again, it shall never grieve me to be in this life one of the most abject
slaves in thy house, so that I may never be separated from thee. Suffer me not
gracious Lord to run the erring steps that I have formerly done: for thou
did consecrate me for thy temple, and I made my self an habitation for the
Devil: Thou gave me armor, and did bind me to be thy true knight, and I
have gone traitorously to thy enemies side, using thine own weapons against
thee; thou did espouse my soul unto thee in perpetual charity, and I have
proved disloyal, following the love of vanities more then thy truth, and
esteemed a creature, more then the Creator. But now Lord incline thee unto me,
I beseech thee O father of mercy, granting me the favor of thine only
begotten Son, and the remedy of his most grievous passion and death: grant
me also thy holy spirit, that it may cleanse my heart, and confirm it in thy
grace any favor, that through mine ignorance I do never run again into my
late banishment, from whence thy loving kindness has called me back, but
that I may continue in thy obedience, even from this present hour of my
repentance unto the last hour of my transitory life. To thee O my Lord be
perpetual glory, honor, power, and dominion, world without end.

OF THE THREE SORTS OF MEN, ALL DIVERSELY affected in things concerning God.
Men are either
OPEN WICKED, Licentious and profane livers, professed enemies of the Law of
the Lord, Job 21.14.15.

These are borne but after the flesh, therefore savor they only the things of
the flesh, and remain as they are by nature, children of wrath, Ioh. 3.6. 1.
Cor. 2.16. Ephe. 2.3.

These are neither chosen of God, nor called; being neither of the Church, nor
in the same, Psalm 11.5. Reu. 22.14. 1. Cor. 5.12.

In these sin daily increases inwardly and outwardly, till righteousness in
the^ be utterly extinct Psalm. 36.1.2.3.4.

To these the law if it be sent, comes in tables of stone, (for such is the
nature of hearts;) but they receive it not; the tables are broken before they
come at them, for these dance (as it were) about the golden calfe of their own
impiety, know not what is become of Moses, they break and violate all. Exodus
32. Yet unto such the Law is given, and lies upon them as a curse and
condemnation. 1. Tim. 1.9. Deuteronomy. 27.15, 26.

These keep not the Law, neither are they kept by the Law, but break forth
into all sin and wickedness. Job 24.13, etc. Psalm. 73.8, 9.

These hate the Law, and profess their hatred. Psalm. 2.3. Job 22.17.

These are naked, yet without shame: though all men see their filthiness, they
hide it not. Ier. 6.15. and 8.12.

These call not upon God. Psalm 14.4.

These accustomed to do evil, neither change ^hemselues nor their actions.
Ier. 13.23.

These are strangers, not children ^or yet servants ^n the household ^f faith.
Ephesians. 2.12. Psalm. 58, 3.

These go not out ^o meet the ^ridegroome; neither come to ^^e wedding ^^ough
they be ^uited, Mat. 22.^5.

These are ^^rknesse, both before God and the world Pro 4.19.

These, though sick unto death, yet (like the mad man possessed of devils,
Mar. 5 2 3 etc. which raued, and felt not nor di^cerned his own misery,) they
seek no remedy for their disease. Proverb. 14.16. and 23.34 35.

These do the evil which they love and would do. Job 20 12.13 Prou 2.14.

These expect no salvation, either by themselves or by any other. Isa. 22.13.

These die by Moses sword, as the Idolaters. Exodus 32. the Madianites, Numb. 31.
the Amorites, Sihon, Ogh, and the like.

These both shall perish, and be punished with everlasting perdition, from the
presence of the Lord; their portion shall be with the devils in the lake of
fire and brimstone, which is the second death. Mat. 25.30.41. and 24.51. Job
13.16. 2. These. 1.8.9. Reave. 20.10.13.15.

The wicked shall turn into hell. Psalm. 9.17.

The rejoicing of the wicked is short; the joy of Hypocrites is but a moment.
Job 20.5.

HYPOCRITES, Outwardly rel^gious, but inwardly wicked, hating Gods Law, and the
true righteousness, Isay 29.13. Mic. 3.11.

These seem to be renewed, and born again of the Spirit, they are enlightened
and boast of heavenly grace: yet continue they still in their old natural
corruption, unwashed from their filthiness. Heb. 6 4. Isa. 65.5. Ioh. 8 41.22.
Pro. 30.12.

These are called, but not chosen; are in the Church for a while, but not of
it, Mat. 22.14. 1. Ioh. 2.19.

In these, righteousness increases outwardly, but sin lives inwardly, and
abounds, Isa. 1.11 etc. Ier. 3.4.5.

To these God gives the stony tables, and they receive them; but Moses face
so shines, that they cannot look upon him, unless he veil his countenance.
They outwardly keep the law, and rest therein, they also teach others to keep
it, yet are themselves transgressors of it; the inward power and end thereof,
they cannot see. Exodus 34.29, 30, etc. 2. Cor. 3.13, 14. Romans 2.17, 22, 23, etc.

These, though they keep not the Law, yet are kept by the Law, and restrained
by terror thereof, from open wickedness. Math. 23.13.16.23.25.

These hate the Law, but profess to love it. Psalm. 78.36, 37.

These ashamed of their nakedness, cover it with fig-leaues, or spiders webs of
their own external righteousness Isa. 59.5.6.

These cry but God hears them not. Isa. 1.15.

Hos. 7.16.

These are in the house, but as servants, not as children. John 8.35.36. Galat.
4.22. etc.

These go with their lamps, but without oil; they come to the feast, but want
the wedding garment. Mat. 25 3. and 22.11.1^.

These are light before the world, but darkness before God. Mat. 6.2 5.16.
Isa. 58.2.3.8

These* though they see and know their sickness, yet like to King Asa, they
seek not the Lord in their disease, but to the Physicians, or with salues and
medicines of their own making, think to cure themselves. 2. Chro. 16 12. Ioh
5.40. Hos. 5.13.

These do not the evil which they love, but the good which they love not, Nu^.
14.2.4.40

These expect salvation by themselves, and their own righteousness Ro^. 10, 3.
Ier. 2.35.

These under Moses conduct perish by Gods hand in the desert, and come not into
the Land of promise.

These both shall perish, and be punished with everlasting perdition, from the
presence of the Lord; their portion shall be with the devils in the lake of
fire and brimstone, which is the second death. Mat. 25.30.41. and 24.51. Job
13.16. 2. These. 1.8.9. Reave. 20.10.13.15.

The Hypocrites hope shall perish Job 8.13.

The rejoicing of the wicked is short; the joy of Hypocrites is but a moment.
Job 20.5.

SAINTS, that rightly believe and obey Gods word, with their utmost power; the
friends of the Lord. Psalm. 119.3.5 10.11. etc.

These are borne anew, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, or of man,
but of God: therefore they savor the things of God, and mind heavenly things,
being children of Wisdom, Ioh. 6.13. and 3.3. Luke 7.35.

These are called and chosen of God; are both in and of the Church, and so
continue. Ephesians. 1.4. etc. Job 17.9.

In these, sin dies and righteousness reuiueth daily, both inwardly and
outwardly. Romans 6.2, 3, 4, etc.

To these the law is not given, or it lies not ((...)) on them, 1. Tim. 1.9.
for they have the Gospel, the Law and Ministry of the Spirit, and Gods word
is written in fleshly tables of their hearts, within and without, by the finger
of God: and they all behold as in a mirror, the glory of the Lord with open
face, and are changed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the
Spirit of the Lord. 2. Cor 33.18. Eze. 11 19 Heb 8.10.

These are the right keepers of the Law in spirit, which sometime also were
kept of the Law, til Faith came. Psalm. 119.33, 34. Gal. 3.23, 25.

These love the Law, and profess their love. Psalm 119.97. Romans 7.22.

These have their nakedness covered of Christ, and by the garments of his
righteousness. Revel. 3.18. and 16.15.

These call upon God, and he answers them, Ier. 29.12.13.

These change both their actions and themselves; or rather are changed of the
Lord, Romans 12.2.

These are no more strangers but children of Gods family, wherein they abide
for ever. Gal. 4.28. 1. Ioh 3

These go to meet the bridegroom with oil in their lamps: and are arrayed
with the wedding robe. Mat. 25.4.

These are light, both before God and the world Ephesians. 5.8. Mat. ^.16. Phil.
2.15.

These see their sins, and feel themselves wounded by those fiery serpents;
but lift up their eyes to the serpent of brass; they seek to Christ only, the
Physician of their souls. Numbers 21.8 9. Ioh. 3.14 15.

These love good and desire to do it, yet do the evil which they hate. Romans
7.15.

These expect salvation only by Christ's righteousness, not by themselves.
Phil. 3.9. Ro^. 3 24.28.

These after Moses death, are brought by Jesus into the rest of Canaan: the
rest that remains for the people of God. Heb. 4.8.9.

These shall enter into the joy of their Lord; shall live and reign with him
in heaven, and with his holy Angels for evermore Amen. Mat. 25.21.34.46

The Saints shall be preserved for ever. Psalm. 37.28.

And men shall say, Verily there is fruit for the righteous; doubtless there
is a God that judges in the earth. Psalm. 58.11.

A prayer unto God the Father.
THou that rulest in the highest, reignest for ever, and only can do all
things, God the governor of heaven and earth, at whose beck all creatures
tremble, and the pillars of heaven shake. O heavenly God, perfect workman and
Potter, I wretch made out of clay, or rather of filthy mudde, with fear and
trembling come before the throne of thy majesty. I acknowledge and confess my
wickedness, I know that I am nothing, yea that I am mere abomination and
horror in thy sight, if thy grace and mercy do fail me: without thee I think
no goodness, without thee I do no good thing: without thee I am a contemptible
creeping worm.

I cannot be saved without thine assistance, my salvation depends on thy
hands. I give thee thanks, O God, and in especial for this, for that thou have
given me that knowledge, that I may see and know that I am nothing, and unable
to do any thing without thee. Thou art the Potter, I the clay: such as thou will have me be, such can thou form and fashion me: if thou make me
blessed, thou show thy mercy and grace: if thou castest me into perdition,
thou show thy justice, and executest thy judgment: neither is it my duty to
contradict thee, why, or for what reason thou do it. For thou have mercy
upon him who^ thou love: these things I meditate with my self, o Lord, and I
fear thy judgments.

Since therefore, all my safety and salvation depends on thee, and
consists in thy hand and power, and since thou have showed thy self a
merciful and long-suffering God to the whole world: and have testified the
same indeed, in that thou would thy only Son Jesus Christ the innocent,
should die for our offenses, and expiate our sins with his blood on the
Cross. Finally, since thou have taught us in all our perturbations to call
upon thee, and ask thy grace and mercy, for that thou will give us all things
which we shall ask in the name of thy Son: I come unto thee, being dross
and a lump of day, O merciful and celestial Potter, beseeching thee most
humbly, that thou will use thy mercy, and make of this unworthy matter, a
vessel of eternal glory. Vouchsafe also of thy mere grace, to fix my mind
on perfect faith, assured hope, and chaste and holy love, that being justified
by these thy gifts, I may become upright, perfect, good and holy, according to
thy good will, both in the midst, and end of my life, as also at the latter day
of judgment.

O merciful Father, grant me pardon of all my sins: through the death of thy
beloved Son Jesus Christ, make me to please thee alone: grant me to be thy
grateful son and heir, increase in me that justice whatsoever, which is
given me, and granted from heaven, that I may continue and end my life in the
same: increase in me that faith which thou have given me: kindle my love of
thee, and make it more apparent, that by thy help, and the presence of thy
grace, and the accomplishment of thy holy will, I may obtain everlasting life
which thou have promised us, to the end I may praise thee, and give thee
thanks in thy kingdom* for ever and ever. Amen.

A Prayer to God the Son.
O Thou maker and redeemer of mankind, Jesus Christ, who saidest, I am the way,
the truth, and the life: the way in doctrine, precept and examples: the truth
in promises: the life in reward: I pray thee by thy unspeakable charity,
wherewith thou daignest to employ thy self wholly for our salvation, suffer me
never to wander from thee who art the way: neither ever to distrust in thy
promises, who art the truth, and performest whatsoever thou do promise:
neither to repose or rely on any other thing, because thou art eternal life,
than which, there is nothing more to be desired, neither in heaven nor in
earth. By thee have we learned the true and ready way to eternal salvation,
lest we should wander any longer in the Labyrinthes of this life. Thou did
teach us exactly how to believe, what to do, what to hope, and in whom we ought
to rest: by thee we have learned how unhappy we were borne through our first
father Adam, by thee we have learned that there is no hope of salvation, except
by faith in thee.

Thou have taught us that thou art the only light that shinest to all men in
the desert of this wolrd, co^ducting them through the night of their minds,
from the Egyptian darkness, to that blessed Land which thou promisest unto the
meek, and such as follow thy humility. For in us was nothing but utter
darkness, who neither could see our calamity, neither know from whence to
seek the remedy of our misery: thou daignedst to enter into the world,
vouchsafedst to take upon thee our nature, that thy doctrine might disperse the
cloud of our ignorance: that by thy precepts thou might direct our feet in
the way of peace: by the examples of thy life thou did limit out a path for
us to immortality: and beating it with thy steps, thou made it of a tedious
and rough, an easy and beaten way. So becamest thou unto us a way, that
knows no error, in which lest we should be wearied, thy bounty with great
and assured promises, vouchsafed to assure us: for who could be wearied, that
thinks how in following thy footsteps there is an heritage of eternal life
prepared for him? Therefore whilst we are in this journey, thou would in
stead of a staff be an assured hope unto us whereby we might be sustained.

Neither was thy goodness contented herewith, but acknowledging the frailty of
our natures, in the mean space with the comfort of the holy Spirit thou
repairest our courages, to the end that we may more willingly run unto thee.
And as thou being made a way unto us driuest away all error, so becoming our
truth, thou take away al distrust.

Finally, being made life unto us, thou give heat unto those that are dead
in sin, a life through thy holy Spirit which quickens all things, until
all mortality laid aside, in the resurrection we may always live with thee and
in thee, by reason that thou art unto us all in all things: For it is eternal
life to know the Father, and the Son, and the holy Ghost, to be one true God.
Wherefore I beseech thee, O most merciful Father, to increase faith in me who
am thy unworthy servant, lest at any time I waver in thy celestial doctrine:
increase obedience in me, lest I swerue from thy precepts, increase constancy,
that walking in thy ways, I neither be allured by the inticements of Satan,
nor dejected by his terrors: but that I may persevere in thee who art the true
way, to my lives end. Increase my faith, that possessed of thy promises, I may
never wax slow in the study of godliness: but forgetting those things I have
left behind me, I may always strive and endeavor for more perfection.

Increase thy grace in me, that daily more and more being mortified my self: I
may live and be encouraged by thy holy Spirit, fearing nothing but thee, than
whom there is nothing more amiable, glorying in none but in thee, who art the
true glory of all the Saints, wishing nothing but thee, than whom there is
nothing better: desiring nothing but thee, who art full and perfect felicity,
with the Father and the holy Ghost, world without end. Amen.

A prayer to God the holy Ghost.
HOly Spirit, our Advocate who on Whitsunday did descend upon thy Apostles,
filling their bosoms with charity, grace, and wisdom: I pray thee by that
thy unspeakable mercy and liberality, that thou will vouchsafe to fill the
secrets of my soul with thy grace, and water my inward heart with the
unspeakable sweetness of thy love: Come holy Ghost, and from heaven send a
beam of thy light. Come thou Father of the poor, come thou giver of gifts,
come thou light of hearts, come thou gracious comforter, thou sweet guest of
my soul, my pleasant refresher. Come thou Physician of those that faint, come
thou purger of eyes, come thou strength of the frail, come thou remedy of
sins, come thou doctor of the humble, come thou destroyer of the proud, come
thou excellent ornament of all virtues: come thou only salvation of the dying.
Come my God, and adorn a bed for thee, in which I may worthily entertain
thee, with all thy riches and mercies: fill me with the gifts of thy wisdom,
illuminate me with the benefit of understanding, govern me with the gift of
counsel, confirm me with the gift of fortitude, instruct me with the gift of
science, wound me with the gift of piety, and pierce my heart with the gift of
thy holy fear.

O sweet lover of clean hearts, burn and inflame all my bowels with the
sweet fire of thy love, that being inflamed, they may be carried and ravished
into thee, who art the center and final end of all my good: o sweet lover of
^oly souls, since thou art not ignorant that I can do nothing of my self nor
by my self, stretch out thy favorable hand over me, and grant yt I may forsake
my self, and fly unto thee: mortify, extinguish and dissolve in me
whatsoever is displeasant unto thee, that in all things thou may conform me
unto thy will, that my life hereafter may be a perfect sacrifice in thy sight,
or rather an offering which may wholly be consumed in the fire of thy love.

O who shall give me the grace, that I may at least attain this chief good?
Look upon me, o Lord, look upon me, and see here this thy poor creature: my
soul sighing after thee day and night, how she thirsts after God: when shall
I come and appear before the presence of thy grace? When shall I enter into
that admirable place of thy Tabernacle that I may attain the house of my God?
When wi^^ thou fill me with the light of the countenance? When shall I b^
satiate with the presence of thy glory? When shall I by th^^ means be
delivered from a^^ temptations? and when shall overcome this frailty of my
mo^talitie? O eternal fountain o^ light, bring me back again (...) the
Abyss of eternal goodness by whom I am created, that ^ere I may know thee,
even as I am known of thee, and may so love thee, as I am loved by thee, that
I may see and enjoy thee in the society of all the elect, even as thou also
have seen me from everlasting, Amen.

FINIS.
