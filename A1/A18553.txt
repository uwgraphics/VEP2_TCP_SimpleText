The book of Fame made by Gefferey Chaucer
GOd torn us every dreme to good
For it is wonder thing by the wod
To my wit / what cousyth sweuenys
On the morrow / or on euenys
And why theffect follows of som^e
And of som^e it shall never come
Why that it is a visyon
And why this / a reuelacion
Why this a dreme / why that a sweuen
And not to every man / syche even
Why this a fanton / why they oracles
I note / but who so of these miracles
The causes know bet than I
Deuyne he / for I certainly
Ne can hem not ne never think
To besy my wit / for to swynke
To know of her signyfycacions
The gendres ne dystynctions
Of the times of hem ne the causis
Or why this is more than that is
Or yef folks complexions
Make hem dreme of reflections
Or ellis thus as other seyne
For the great feebleness of her brayn
By abstynence / or by sekenes
Prison / stryf / or great dystres
Or else by dysordynance
Or naturel accustomance
That som^e men be to curyous
In study / or melancolyous
Or thus / so inly full of dread
That noman may him bote read
Or ellis that devotion
Of som^e / and contemplacion
Causen such dremes often
Or that the cruel life vnsofte
Of them that loves leden
Often hopen much or dreden
That purely her impressions
Causen hem to have visions
Or if spyrites ^an the might
To make folk to dreme on night
Or if the soul of propre kind
Be so perfyght as men find
That it wot / what is to come
And that he warns all and som^e
Of eueryche of her auentures
By auysyons or by fygures
But that our flessh has no might
To understand it a right
For it is warned to derkly
But why the cause is / not wot I
Well worth of this thing clerkis
That treten of that and of other werkis
For I of none oppynyon
No^ as now / make mention
B^t on^y that the holy rode
Torn us every dreme to good
For neeur sith I was born
Ne noman else me byforn
Met I trow steadfastly
So wonderful a dreme / as did I
THe tenthe day of decembre
The which as I can remember
I will make inuocacio^
With a devout specyal devotion
Unto the god of sleep anon
That dwellyth in a cave of stone
Upon a streme that comes fro le^e
That is a flode full vnswetr
Beside a folk that men clepe cym^rye
There slepeth ay this god vnmerye
With his slepy thousand sons
That allewey to sleep / her won i^
And to this god / that I of read
Pray that he will me speed
My sweuene for to tell a right
Ye^ any dreme stand in his might
And he that mouer is of all That is and was / and ever shall
So give hem Joy that it here
Or all that they dreme to year
And for to stand all in grace
Of her loves / or in what place
That hem were leuest for to stand
And shield hem / from pouerte and shonde
And from every vnhapp and dysese
And send hem that may hem plese
That takes well / and scorneth naught
Ne it mysdeme in her thought
Through malicious intencion
And he through his presumpcion
Or hate / (...) sc^^ne / or through envy
Despyte. or Iape / or felonye
Mysdeme it / pray I Ihesus good
Dreme he barefoot or dreme be shood
That every harm / that any man
Has had sith the world began
Befalle him thereof / or he sterue
And grant / that he may it deserve
Lo with such a conclusion
As had of his vysion
Cresus / that was king of lyde
That he upon a gy^et did
This prayer shall he have of me
I am no bette in charity
NOw herkene as I have you said
What that I met / or I abreyd
Of decembre the tenthe day
When it was night to sleep I lay
Right as I was wont to done
And fyl a sleep / wonder sone
As he that was weary for go
On pylgremage myle^ two
To the corpse of saint leonard
To maken lythe that erst was hard
But as I slepte / me met I was
Wy^hin a temple y made of glass
In which / there were mo images
Of gold / standing in diverse stages
And mo rich tabernacles
And with perte / mo pynnacles
And mo rich portretures
And queynt manner of fygures
Of gold work / than I saw ever
For certeynly I nyst never
Where that I was / but well wise I
It was of venus redyly
The temple for in portreture
I saw anon her figure
Naked fletyng in a see
And also on her head parde
Rose garlondes smellyng as a mede
And also fleyng about her head
He^ douues / and dan Cupydo
Her blind sone / And vlcano
That in his face was full brown
But I romed up and down
I fond that on a wall there was
Thus written on a table of bras
I will now sing if that I can
The arms and also the man
That first came through his destyne
Fugytyf fro Troy / the contre
In to Itaylle with much pyne
Unto the strondes of lauyne
And tho began the storye anon
As I shall tell you each on
First saw I the destruction
Of Troy through the greek Synon
With his false untrue forsweryng
And with his chere and his lesyng
Made the horse / brought in to Troy
By which Trojans lost their Joy
And after this was graued alas
How ylion assailed was
And won / and king Priamus slain
And plyto his sone certain
Dyspytously of dan Pirrus
And next that / saw I how Venus
When that she saw the castle brende
Down from heaven she began descend
And bad her sone / En^as flee
And how he fled / and how that he
Escaped was / from all the prees
And took his fader old Anchyses
And dare him on his back awey
Cryeng alas / and we^eawey
The which Anchises in his hand
Bare tho the gods of the land
Thylke / that vnbrennyd were
Then sawh I next in all this fere
How Creusa daun Eneas wife
Whom that he loved as his life
And her young sone Iulo
And eke askanius also
Fledden eke with drery chere
That it was pity for to h^re
And in a forest as they went
At a tornyng of a went
How Creusa was y lost / alas
That ^ede note I how it was
How he her sought / and how her ghoos^
Bad him ^le the greeks host
And seyde he most in to Itaylle
As was his destyne / sauns fayll^
That it was pyt^ for to here
When her spyryte began appear
(...) worde^ / that to him she ^eyd^
And for to k^pe her sone she preyd^
There saw I graven eke / how he
His fader eke and his meyne
With his shyppis began to saylle
Tolbard the contre of I will
As straight as that they might go
There saw I eke / the cruel Juno
That art dan Iubit^rs wife
That have hated all thy life
All the Twian blood
Run and cry as thou were wood
On Eolus the god of wyndes
To blown out of all kinds
So loud that he should drenche
Lord. lady. grome. and w^nche
Of all the trojans nation
Without any of her sauacion
There saw I such tempest arys^
That every heart might agryse
To see hit p^ynted on the wa^
There saw I eke g^^uen with al
Venus / how ye my lady d^^e
Weeping with full woeful chere
Prayng Iubiter on hye
To save and keep that nauy^
Of that Trogean Eneas
Sith that he her sone was
There saw I Jove's and venus kiss
And granted was of the tempest lysse
There saw I how the tempest stent^
And how with pain he went^
And pryuely took a ryuage
In the contre of Cartage
And on the morrow / hou that he
And a knight that hight Ach^te
Metten with venus that day
^^yng in a queynt a^aye
As she had be an huntrresse
With wind blowyng her tresse
And how Eneas began to pleyne
When he knew her / of his pain
And how his ships dreynt were
Or ellis y lost he nyst where
How she began him conforte the
And bad him to Cartage go
And there he should his folk find
That in the sea were left behind
And shortly of this thing to pass^
She made Eneas so in grace
Of Dido queen of that contre
That shortly for to tellen / she
Becam his love / and let him d^
All that wedd^^g longs to
What should I speak more queynt
Or pain / my words to peynte
To speak of love / it will not be
I can not of that fa^^lte
And eke to tellen of the manner
How they first acqueynted were
It were a long process to t^ke
And over long for you to dwell^
There saw I grave / how Eneas
Told to Dido every ^^as
That him was tyd upon the sea
And efte graven was how that she
Made of him shortly at a word
Her life / her love / her lust / her lord
And did to him all reverence
And leyd on him all dyspen^^
That any womman might do
Wenyng all hit had be so
As he her swore and h^rtly demed
That he was good / for he such seemed
Alas what harm does apparenc^
When it is false in existen^e
(...) he to her a traitor was
Wherefore she slow her self alas
Lo how a womman does amys
To love him that unknown is
For every trust / lo thus it faryth
It is not all gold that glaryth
For also browke I mine head
There may be under goodlyhede
Couerd many a sherewd vice
Therefore be no wight so nyce
To take a love only for chere
Or for speech or frendely manner
For thus shall every womman find
And swear / how he is unkind
Or falls prouyd / or double was
All this say I by Eneas
And dido / and her nece lost
That louyd al to sone a ghost
Therefore I will say o proverb
That he that fully knows the herb
May saufly leye it to his eye
Wythouten dread that is no lie
But let us speak of Eneas
How he betrayed her alas
And left her full unkindly
So when she all saw utterly
That he would her of troth faylle
And wend fro her in to Itaylle
She began to wrynge her hands two
Alas quod she / that mine heart is wo^
Alas is every man thus true
That every year will have a new
If hit so long time endure
Or ellis three perauenture
And thus of one / he will have fame
In magnefyeng his owen name
Another for frenshyp seyth he
And yet shall the third be
That is taken / for delight
Lo or else for synguler prouffyte
In such words began complain
Dido / of her great pain
As me met / dremyng redyly
None other auctour alege will I
Alas quod she my sweet heart
Have pity of my sorrows smerte
And sle me not / go not away
O woeful Dido / weleaway
Quod she / to her self tho
O Eneas what will ye do
O that love / ne oath ne your bond
That ye swore with your right hand
Ne my cruel death quod she
May hold you stylle with me
O. have ye of my death pity
Y wys my own dear h^rte ye
Know full well that never yet
As fer as ever I had wit
Agylte you in thought ne in deed
O men have ye such goodlyhede
In speech / and never a dele in truth
Alas / that ever had routhe
Any womman / on a falls man
Now I see well and tell can
We wretchyd wymmen can no art
For certain for the more part
Thus we ben served euerychone
How sore ye men can groan
Anon as we have you resceyuyd
Certainly / we be dysceyuyd
For though your love last a seson
Wait upon the conclusion
And eke how ye determyne
And for the more part defyne
O weleaway / that I was born
For through you my name is born
and mine acts red and song
Oueral this land in every tongue
Of wicked fame / for there nys
No thing so swyft / ^o as she is
O sith every thing is wist
Though it be couerd with the mist
Eke though I might / endure ever
That I have don / recover I never
That I ne shall be said / alas
Y shamed was through Eneas
And that I shall thus Iuged be
Lo / right as she has now / she
Will done eftsoon hardely
Thus seyth the people preuely
But that is don / is not to done
But all ^er compleynt / ne her mo^^
Cer^^yn avails not a s^^e
And when she wist sothly / ^e
Was for^h in to his ship goon
S^e in to her chamber w^nte anon^
And called for her suster Anne
And began her to complain than^^
And said that she the cause was
That she so loved alas
And thus councey^^yd she her to
But what when this said was and d^
S^e roof her self to the heart
And so deyde / through her smert^
But all the manner / hou she deyde
And all the words how she seyde
Who so to know / has it in purpoo^
Read Vyrgyle in Eneydo^
O^ the e^ystle of Ouyde
What that she wrote / or she deyde
And nere it were to long t^ndyte
By god I would it here write
But welawey / the harm and routhe
That has betyd for such untruth
As men may often in books read
And alday / it is yet in deed
That for to thynken it tren is
Lo Demophon / duk of Athenes
How he forswore him falsely
And trayed Phillis wyckedly
That kings daughter was of trace
And falsely began his term pace
And when she wist / that he was fa^^
She henge her self by the hals
For he had don her such vntrowthe
Lo was not this / a woo and routhe
Eke look how falls and recheles
Was to Breseyda Achylles
And Paris to Oenone
And Jason to ysyphyle
And eft Jason to Med^a
And Hercules to Dionyra
For he l^ft her for Yolee
That made him catch his death parde
How falls was eke Thescus
That as the story tells us
How he betrayed Adriane
The devil be his soul bane
For had he sanged or ^ow^id
He must have been all deuourid
Yef that Adrian had not be
And for she had of him pity
She made him from the death escape
And he made her a full falls Iape
For after this / within a while
He left her slepyng within an isle
Desert allone within the s^e
And scale away / and let her be
And took her suster / Phed^a tho
With him / and began to ship go
And yet had he sworn to ^ere
On all that ever he might swear
That so she sauyd him his life
He would taken her to his wife
For she desired nothing ellis
In certain / as the book us tellis
But texcuse this Eueas
Fullych of his great trespaas
The book says sauns faylle
The goddis bad him go to Itaylle
And leven Affryques regyoun
And Dido and her fair town
Tho I saw grave hou to ytaylle
Dan Eneas is goon to saylle
And hou the tempest al began
And hou he lost his stere^man
Which that the stern / or he tok^ keep
Smot^ over the board / lo er he lepe
And also saugh I how s^byle
And Eneas beside an isle
To hell wenten for to see
His fader Anchyses the fre
And how he there fond Polymarus
And also Dido / and Deyphebus
And euerych torment eke in hell
Saw he which no tongue can tell
Which / who so list to know
He must read many a row
In Virgyle / or in Claudian
Or daunt / that it tellen can
There saw I eke all the arryuaylle
That Eneas had made in to ytaylle
And with king latin his tret^e
And all the bataylles that he
Was at him self / and all his knyghtis
Or he had all ywonne his ryghtis
And when he turnus reft his life
And wan lauyna to his wife
And all the meruayllous signals
Of the gods celestyals
How maugre Juno / Eneas
For all her flygt and compass
Achyeuyd all his adventure
For Iubiter took on him ^ure
At the prayer of venus
The I pray always save us
And us aye of our sorrows light
When I had all seyn this sight
In this noble temple thus
Ay lord / thought I that made us
Yet saw I never such noblesse
Of images / ner such richesse
As I saw graven in this church
But not wot I / who did hem wyrche
Ne where I am ne in what contre
But anon I began out see
Right at the wyket / if I can
Seen oughwher / any steryng man
That would have told where I am
When I out of the door came
I fast about me beheld
Then saw I but a large field
As fer as ever I might see
Without town / house / or tree
Or busshes or gras / or ered land
For all the field was but of sonde
As small as man may see at eye
In the deserte of lybye
Ne I no manner creature
That is fourmed by natu^re
Ne saw I / me to read or wysse
O Christ thought I / that art in bliss
From fanton / and illusioun
Me save / and with deuocioun
Mine eyes to the heaven I cast
Tho was I ware / ^o at the last
That fast by the son an hye
As ke^ne might I / with mine ^ye
Me thought I saw an Egle fore
But that it seemed much more
Than I had any Egle I seen
This is as soth / as does certain
It was of gold / and shone so bright
That never saw men such a sight
But if the heaven had y won
All new of gold another son
So shone the Egles feathers bright
And sone downward began it light
Explicit liber primus
Incipit liber secundus
TOw herkene every manner man
Hat any manner of englyssh can
And listeneth / of my dreme to lere
For at the first / shall ye here
So s^ly / and so dredeful a vision
That I say that never Scipio^
Ne king Nabugodonosor
Pharao. Turnus. ne Elcanor
Ne metten such a dreme as this
Now fair blysful O cyprys
So be my favor at this time
That ye me tendytr and ryme
Help ye that in pornaso dwell
By side Elycon the clew well
O. thought. that wrote all that I met
And in the tresorye it set
Of my brayn / now shall men see
If any virtue / in the be
To tell all my dreme a right
Now kythe thyn engyn and might
This Egle / of which I now have told
That his feathers shoon all of gold
Which that so hye began to sore
I began beholden more and more
To seen her beauty / and the wonder
But never was there dynte of thonder
Ne that thing that men call fowdre
That smite sone a tour to powdre
And in his swyft coming brende
That so swythe began douneward descend
And this foul when I beheld
When I a rowme was in the field
And with his grym pawys strong
Within his sharp nails long
Me fleyng / at a swap he hente
And with his sours / again up went
Me caryeng in his claws stark
As lightly as I had been a lark
How hye I can not tell you
For I came up I nyste never how
For so astoned and assweued
That every virtue in my heued
What with his sours and my dread
That all my felyng began to deed
For why it was a great affraye
Thus I long / in his claws lay
Till at last / he to me spack
In man's voys / and said awake
And said be not aghast so for shame
And called me tho by my name
And for I should better abreyde
Me to awake / thus he seyde
Right in the same voys and steven
That uses one / that I can neuen
And with that voys soth to seyn
My mind came to me ageyn
For it was godely said to me
So was it never wont to be
And here with all I began to ste^e
As he me in his feet ^ere
Till that he felt that I had ^ete
And felt eke tho mine heart beat
And tho began he me to dysporte
And with gentyl words me conforte
And seyde twyes saint Marye
Thou art anoyous thing to carye
And nothing needs it parde
For also wys god help me
As thou no harm shall have of this
And this was that betyd the is
Is for thy bore and for thy prowe
Let see dare thou look yet now
Be full ensured boldly
I am thy friend / and therwyth I
Began for to wondre in my mind
O god quod I that made all kind
Shall I none otherwise dye
Whether Jove will me stellyfye
Or what thing may this signefye
I am nether Enock ne Helye
Ne Romulus ne Ganemede
That were bore up as men read
To heaven / with dan Iubiter
And made the goddis boteler
Lo this was tho my fantasye
But he that bare began espy
That I so thought / and said this
Thou d^mest of thy self amys
For Jove is not there about
I dar the put full out of d^ute
To make of the yet a sterre
But er I bear the much far
I will the tell what I am
And whyther thou shall and why I came
To do this so that thou take
Good heart / and not for fere quake
Gladly quod I / now well quod he
First I that in my f^et have the
Of whom thou have feer and wonder
I am dwelling / with the god of thoeder
Which men callen Iubiter
That does me fleen full often fer
To do all his commandment
And for this cause he has me sent
To the / herke now by thy truth
Certain he has of the routhe
That thou have so truly
Long served ententyfly
His blind neuew Cupido
And fair venus also
With out guerdon ever yet
And netheles have set thy wit
Al though in thy head / full lytyl is
To make books. songs.or ditees
In ryme or ellis in Cadence
As thou best can in reverence
Of love and of his seruantis eke
That have his seruyse sought and seek
And peynest the to preyse his art
Al though thou had never part
Wherefore also god me bless
Jove's holt hit great humblesse
And virtue / eke thou do wake
On night and make thyn head ache
In thy study / so thou wrytest
And evermore of love endytest
In honor of him and preysyng
And in his folks furthryng
And in her matter all deuysest
And not him ne his folk de^pisest
All though thou may go in the dance
Of hem that him list not auaunce
Wherefore as I seyde ywys
Iubyter considers well this
And also ^eau sire of other thyngis
That is / thou have no tidings
Of loves folk / if they be glade
Ne of nothing else / that god made
And not only fro fer contre
That no tidings comen to the
Not of thy very neygheboris
That dwellen almost at thy doris
Thou herest neither that ne this
For when thy labor all don is
And have made all thy rekenyngis
Instead of rest and of new thyngis
Thou ghost home / to thyn house anon
And also dombe as a stone
Thou sit at an other book
Till fully daswed is thy book
And lyuest thus as an hermyte
All though thyn abstynence is lyte
And therefore Jove's through his grace
Will that I shall bear the to a place
Which that hyte the house of fame
And to ^o the sport and game
In som^e recompensacion
Of thy labor and devotion
that tho^ have had / lo causeles
To god Cupido the recheles
And thus this god for his merit
Will with som^e manner thing the quyte
So that thou wylt be of good chere
For trust well / that thou shat her^
When we be comen / there I say
Mo wonder things / I dar well lay
And of loves folk mo tidings
Both sothsawes / and lesynges
And mo loves / new begone
And long served till love is won
And mo lovers casuelly
That been betyd / noman wot why
But as a blind man sterteth an hare
And more Iolyte / and welfare
While they find love of stele
As think men / and oueral well
Mo dyscordis / and mo Ielousyes
Mo murmures / and mo nouelryes
And also mo dyssymylacions
And eke feyned reperacions
And mo berdes in two ours
Without rasour or sysours
Y made than graynes be of sondes
And eke mo haldyng in hondes
And also mo renouelances
Of old forleten acqueyntances
Mo louedayes / and mo accordes
Than on Instrumentis ben cords
And eke of love moo eschaunges
Than ever corns were in grau^ges
Uneath may thou trrowen this
Quod he / no so help me god as wys
Quod I / ne why quod he / for it
Were impossyble to my wit
Though fame had all the pyes
In all a ^oyame / and all espyes
How that she should here all this
Or they aspyen that or this
Quod he to me / that can I preue
By reason worthy for to leave
So that thou give thyn aduertence
To understand my sentence
First shall thou here where she dwellyth
Right so as thyn owen book tells
Her palace stondeth as I shall say
Right even amyddes of the way
Between heaven / earth / and see
That what so ever in all the three
Is spoken in pryue or appert
The way thereto is so smert
And stant eke in so Just a place
That every sown mote to it pace
Or what so comyth / from any tongue
Be it rowned / red or song
Or spoken in sewerte / or dread
Certain it mote thethyr need
Now herkne well / for why I will
Tellen the a proper Skyl
And a worthy demonstracion
In mine ymagynacion
Geffrey / thou wotest well this
That every kind that is
Has a kyndly stead that he
May best in it conserved be
Unto which place every thing
Through his kyndly enclynyng
Meueth for to come to
Then that is away thereto
As thus / lo hou thou may alday see
That any thing / that heavy be
As stone or led / or thing of weight
And bear it never so high on heyght
Let^ go thyn hand / it falls down
Right so say I by fire and soun
Or smoke or other things light
Alleway they seek upward on hight
Light things up and downward charge
While eueryche of bem be at large
And for this cause thou may well see
That every river vuto the sea
Enclyned is to goo by kind
And by these skylles I find
Have fysshes dwelling in flood and see
And trees eke on earth be
Thus every thing by his reason
Has his owen propre mancion
The which he seeks to repair
There as it should not apayre
Lo this sentence is known couthe
Of every philosophers mouth
As Aristotle and dan Platon
And other clerkys many ^on
And to conferme my reason
Thou wost well that speech is a soune
Or ellis noman might it here
Now herke what I will the lere
Sown is not / but eyer y broken
And every speech / that is spoken
Loud or pryue / fowl or fair
In his substance is but an air
For as flame is but lyghtyd smoke
Right so is sown / air y broke
But this may be in many wise
Of which I will the deuyse
As Sown comes of pype or harp
For when a pype is blown sharp
The air is twyst with violence
And rent / lo this is my sentence
Eke when men harp strengis smite
Whether it be much or lyt^
Lo with the serooke / the air to breketh
And right so brekyth it / when men spekyth
This wost thou well / what thing is speech
Now hens forth / I will the teache
How eueryche speech / voys or sown
Through his multyplycacion
Though it were pype or mowse
Mote needs come to fames house
I^ prove it thus / take heed now
By experience for if thou
Threw in a water now a stone
Well wost thou it will make anon
A lytyl roundel as a cercle
Perauenture as broad as a couer^l^
Brodder than him self was
And thus fro roundel to compass
Each a^oute other going
Causes of others steryng
And multyplyeng euermo
Till it be so far go
^^at it at both brynkys be
All though / thou may it not see
Above it goth / yet always under
It is / though thou think it wonder
And who so says / of troth I varye
Bid him prove the contrary
And right thus / every word ywys
That loud or preuy spoken is
Moves first / in the eyer abowte
And of his mouyng out of dowte
Another eyer / anon is moved
As I have of the water proved
That every cercle causes other
Right so of eyer / my leave brother
Eueryche eyer in other steryth
More and more / and speech up beryth
Or voys or noys / word or sown
Ay through multiplicacion
Till it be at the hows of fame
Take it on ernest / or in game
Now have I told if thou have mind
How speech or sown / of pure kind
Enclyned is upward to move
This maysthow feel well by prove
Ha.a. quod he lo so I can
Lewdely unto a lewd man
Speak and show him such skylles
That he may take him by the bylles
So palpable the skylles be
But tell me this / now pray I the
How thinks the / my conclusion

Where that thou know any town

And when thou have of ought knowing
Look that thou warn me

Now hills / and now mounteynes
Now valeyes / and now forestes
And now uneath great bestes
Now ryuers / now great cyt^es
Now towns / now great trees
Now ships sayllyng in the sea
But thus sone / in a while he
Was flowen fro the ground so hye
Tat all the world as to mine eye
No More seemed than a prykke
Or else the eyer was so thykke
That I might it not decerne
With that he spack to me so yerne
And seyde / see thou any token
Or ought / that in the world is of spoken
I said nay / no wonder is
Quod he / for never ha^f so her as this
Nas Alysaunder of Macedo

Ne eke the wryght Dedalus
Ne his sone Nyse Icharus
That flawe so hye / that the hete
His wings malte / and he fyl wete
In myd the sea / and there he dreynte
For whom was made a great compleynt
Now torn upward / quod he / thy face

The cart horse began well aspye
That he could / no governance
And began for to lepe and dance
And bear him up and now down
Till he saw the Scorpyoun
Which that in heaven / a sign is yet
And he for fere / lost his wit
Of that / and let the reins gone
Of these horse and they anon
Began up to mount and down descend^

To let^ a fool have governance
Of things / that he can not demeyn
And with this word soth for to seyn
He began always upper to sore
And gladed me than more and more
So faithfully to me spak he
Tho began I look under me
And beheld the ayrisshe bestes
Clouds mystes and tempests
Snowes. Hayles. raynes / and wyndes
And all thengendryng in her kinds
And all the wey / through which I came
O god quod I that made adam

For more clear entendement
Nadde he me never yet sent
Then thought I on Marcyan
And eke on anteclaudyan

And therefore I can hem believe
With that the Egle can to cry^

As though I knew her places here
And eke they shynen here so bright

A while / And tho he began to cry
That never herd I thing so hye
Hold up thyn head / for it is well

May thou not here that I do
What quod I the great sown
Quod he / that rombleth up and down

And what sown is it like quod he
Peter like the betyng of the sea
Quod I / ay^nst the roches holow
When tempests don her ships swalow
And that a man stand out of doubt
A mile thens and here it rowte
Or ellis like the humblyng
After the clappe of a thondryng
When Jove's has the eyer y beat
But it does me for fere sweet
Nay dread the not thereof quod he
It is nothing / that will grieve the
Thou shall have no harm truly
And with that word / both he and I
As nyghe the place arrived were
As men might cast with a spear
I nys^ how but in a street
He set me fair on my fete
And said walk forth a paas
And tell thyn adventure and caas
That thou shall find in fames place
Now quod I while we have space
To speak or that I go fro the
For the love of god tell me
In soth that I will of the lere

Of folk that forth in earth dwell
And here in the same wise

Of the which / thou wylt have wonder
Lo to the house of fame yonder
Thou wost how comyth every speech
It needs not the more to teache
But understand right well this
When any speech y comen is
Unto that palace anon right
It weye^h lyche the same weight
Which that in earth the word spack
Be he clothed read or black
And has so very his lykenes
That spack the word / and thou wylt guess
That it the same body be
Man or woman he or she
And is not this a wonder thing
Yes quod I / by heuens king
And with this word / fare well quod he
And here will I abide the
And god of heaven send the grace
Som^e good to learn in this place
And I of him took leave anon
And began forth to the palace gone
Explicit liber secundus
Incipit liber Tercius
O God of science and of light
Appollo through thy great might
This lytyl last book / thou now gye
Not that I will for maystrye
Here art poetical be showed
But the ryme that is so lewd
Made it somewhat agreeable
Though som^e verse faylle ^illable
And that I do no dylygence
To show craft / but sentence
And if dyuyne virtue thou
Wylt help me to show now
That in my head markyd is
Lo that is for to meuen this
The house of fame to dyscryue
Thou shall see me go as blyue
Unto the next lawrer I see
And kiss it for it is thy tree
Now enter in to my breast anon
When I was from the Egle gone
I began behold upon this place
And certain or I further pace
I will you all the shap deuyse
Of house of Cite / and of the wise
How I began to the place approach
That stant upon so hye a roche
There stands none so hye in spain
But up I clam with much pain
And though to clymbe / it greuyd me
Yet I ententyf was to see
And for to pour wonder low
Yef I could any wise know
What manner stone this roche was
For it was like a lymed glass
But that it showed more clear
But of what congelyd matere
It was / I ne wist redyly
But at the last espied I
And fond that it was euerydeel
A roche of yse / and not of steel
Thought I by saint Thomas of kent
This were a feeble found^ment
To bylden on / a place so hy^
He aught him well to gloryfye
That heron bylt so god me save
Tho saw I all the halle y grave
With famous folks names feel
That have been in much well
And her fames wide blow
But well uneath might I know^
any letters for to read
Her names / for out of dread
They weren almost ouerthowed so
That of the lettres / one or two
Were molte away / of every name
So vnfamous was wax her fame
But men say / what may ever last
Tho began I in mine heart co^ste
That they were molte away for hete
And not away with storms beat
For on that other side / I say
On this hill that northward lay
How it was wreton full of names
Of folk that had before great fames
Of old time / And yet they were
As fressh as men had wreton hem there
The self day / or that hour
That I on hem began to pour
But well I wyste / what it made
It was conseruyd / with the shade
Of a castle / that so stood on hye
All the writing that I sye
And stood eke in so cold a place
That hete might it not deface
Tho began I on this hill to gone
And fond on the ceppe a wone
That all the men that been on live
Ne han the connyng to dyscryue
The beauty of that ylke place
Ne could cast the compace
Such an other for to make
That might of beauty be his make
Ne so wonderly y wrought
That it astonyed / yet my thought
And makes all my wit to swynke
On this caste^ for to think
So that the great beauty
The cast craft and curiosite
Ne can I not to you deuyse
My wytt may it not suffyse
But netheles all the sulstaunce
I have yet in my remembrance
For why / me thought by saint gyl^
All was of stone of beryle
Bo^he the castle and the tour
And eke the halle and every bour
Without pieces or Ioynynges
But many subtyl compas^ynges
As bab^uwryes and pynnacles
Ymageryes and tabernacles
I saw eke and full of wyndowes
As flakes fallen in great snowys
And eke in every of each pynacles
Were sundry habytacles
In which stoden all they wythouten
Full the castle all abowten
Of all manner of mynstrallis
And gestours that tellen talis
Both of weeping / and of game
And of all / that longs unto fame
There herd I pleye on an harp
That sowned well and sharp
Him Orpheus full craftily
And on his side fast by
Sat the harper / Oryon
And gacides Chyryon
And other harpers many one
And the bryton Glaskyryon
And small harpers / with her gl^ys
Sat under hem in diverse seys
And gone on hem upward to gape
And counterfeted hem as an ape
Or as craft count^rfete kind
Tho saw I hem behind
A fer from hem / as by hem selue
Many thousand time twelve
That made loud mynstraleyes
An cornmuse or shalemeyes
And many an other / pype
That craftily began to pyp^
Both in dowced and in read
That been at festes with the bread
And many a floyte and lytelynge horn
And pype^ made of stree of corn
As have these lytyl herd gromes
That kepen bestis in the bromes
There saw I then dan Cytherus
And of Atthenes / dan proserus
The Marcia / that bost her skyn
Both in face. body and chyn
For that she would enuyen lo
To py^en bet than Appollo
The^^ saw I eke / famous old and young
Pypers of the duc^e tongue
To learn houe dauncis sprynges
Reyes / and the strange things
Tho saw I in an other place
Standing in a large spac^^
Of hem that maken blody sown
In tromp beme and claryoun
For in fight / and blood shedyng
Is used good clarionyng
There herd I trompe messenus
Of whom that speaks virgilius
There herd I Ioab trompe also
Theodonas and other moo
And all that used claryon
In Castyle lion and Aragon
That in her times / famous were
To lernen / saw I trompen there
There saw I sytte in her sees
Ployenge upon other lees
Which I can not neuene
^o than sterris ben in heuene
Of which I nyl / as now not ryme
For ese of you / And l^sse of time
For time y lost that know ye
By no wey / recovered may be
There saw I pley Iogelers
Magyciens and trageotours
And phetonysses and charmeresses
Old wycches and sorceresses
That vsen exorsisacions
And many other Inuocacions
And clerks that connen well
All this magyk naturel
That craftily do her ententes
To maken in certain ascendentes
Images lo / through such magyke
To make a man / hole or seek
There saw I the queen Medea
And Cir^^s eke / and Caliophia
There saw I hermes / ballenus
Lymote / and eke Simon magus
There saw I and knew him by name
That by such art don men fame
There saw I / colle tregetour
Upon a table of Sycomour
Pleye / an uncouth thing to tell
I saw him carye a wynd me^le
Under a walnote shale
What should I make longer tale
Of all the people that I say
I coud not tell till domesday
When I had all this folk behold
And fond me ^oos / and not hold
And eft I mused a longer while
Upon this wall of Beryle
That shone lyghter than a glass
And made it well more than it was
As kind thing of fame is
And then anon after this
I began forth romen till I fond
The castle / that on my right hand
Which so well coruen was
That never such an other nas
And yet it was by adventure
Y wrought by great and subtyl cure
It needs not you for to tell
To make you longer to dwell
Of these yates florysshynges
Ne of compaces ne of keruynges
Ne how the hackyng in masonryes
As corbettis / and ymageryes
But lord so feyr it was to show
For it was all of gold behewe
But in I went and that anon
There met I cryeng many one
A larges / A larges up hold well
God save the lady of this pele
Our owen gentyle lady fame
And hem that wylleth to have a name
Of us / thus herd I cryen all
And fast comen out of the halle
And shoke nobles / and sterlynges
And crowned were they as kings
With crowns wrought full of lesynges
And many reban and many things
Were in her clothes truly
Tho at last / aspyed I
That purseuauntes and herawdes
That cryen rich folks lawdes
It weren all / and every man
Of them as I you tell can
Had on him throw a vesture
Which men clepe a cote Armur^
Enbrowdred wonderly rich
All though they were not ylyche
But not will I so mot^ I thryu^
Be about to dyscryue
All these arms what they weren
That they thus on her cot^s beren
For it to me were Impossible
Men might make of hem a bible
Twenty foot thycke as I trow
For certain who so could know
Might there all the arms see
Of famous folk that had be
In Affry^que. Europe / and Asy^
Sith first lo chyualrye
Lo how should I tell all this
Ne of the ha^le eke / what need is
To tellen you that every wall
Of it / and ^^of and flore with al
Was plated half a foot thykke
Of gold / and that was not wykke
But to proef in all wise
As fyn as doket of venyse
Of which to lyte in my powche is
And were set as thyck as owchys
Full of the fynest stones fair
That men reden in the lapydayre
Or as grasses grown in a mede
But it were al to long to read
The names / And therefore I pace
But in this rich lusty place
That fames halle / called was
Full much prees of folk / there was
No gronyng for somoche prees
But al an hye upon a dees
Sat on a See Emperyal
That was made of a rubye ryal
Which a Carbuncle is y called
I saw perpetuelly y stalled
A femynyn Creature
That never formed by nature
Such Another thing I say
For altherfyrst soth to say
^e thought / that she was so lyte
That the length of a Cubyte
Was longer that she seemed be
But thus sone in a while she
Her self / tho wonderly straight
That with her feet she therthe reyght
And with her head she towchyd heaven
There as shyneth the sterres seven
And thereto yet as to my wit
I saw as great a wonder yet
Upon her eyes to behold
But certeynly / I hem never bold
For as f^ls eyes had she
As feathers upon fowls be
Or weren on the bestis four
That goddis trone can honor
A^ writes John in the Apocalypse
Her ^^er that was owndy and cryps
As ^orned gold shone / as for to see
And soth to tellen also she
Had also feel stondyng eris
And tongues / as on a best ben h^eris
And on her feet woxen saw I
Partrychs wings redyl^y
But lord the perry and richesse
I saw syttyng on the goddess
And the heavenly melodye
Of songs full of Armonye
I herd about her trone y song
That all the palace wall ronge
So song the mighty muse she
That clepyd is Calyope
And her seven sustren eke
That in her faces semen meke
And evermore eternally
The song of fame tho herd I
Heryed be thou and thy name
Goddess of renoun and of fame
Tho was I ware at the last
As I mine eyes began up cast
That this ylke noble quen^
On her shuldres began sustene
Both Arms and the name
Of tho that had large fame
Alysandre and Hercules
That with a sherte his life l^es
And thus fond I syttyng this goddess
In nobley honor and richesse
Of which I styn^e a while now
Other things to tellen you
Tho saw I stand on the other side
Strayt down to the doris wide
From the deys many a pyler
Of metal that shone not full clear
But though they were of no riches
Yet were they made for great nobles
And in hem great sentence
And folk of great and dygne reverence
Of which to tell will I fond
Upon a pyler saw I stand
Alderfyrst / there I seyghe
Upon a pyler stand an hy^
That was of ^ede and of iron fine
Him that wrote thactes dyuyne
The Ebrayk Josephus the old
That of Jews gestis told
And bare upon his sholdres hy^
The fame up of the Iewery^
And by him / there stoden seuene
Wise and worthy / for to neuene
To helpen him ^ere up the charge
It was so heavy and so large
And for they written of bataylles
As well as of other meruaylles
Thefor was ^o this pyler
Of which I you tell he^^
(...) l^de and y^^n both ywys
(...) iron Martis metal is
Which that god is of bataylle
And the leed without faylle
Is Lo the metal of saturn
That has full large wh^le to turn
To stand forth on every row
Of hem / which I could know
Though I by order hem not tell
To maken you to long to dwell
These of which I began read
There saw I stand out of dread
Upon a pyler hye and strong
That peynted was al endlong
With ^ygres blood in every place
The tholoph^n that hight s^ace
That bare of thebes up the name
Upon his sholdres and / the fame
Also of cruel Achylles
And by him without lees
Full wonder high upon a pyler
Of iron he the great Omer
And with him dares and Titus
Before and eke he lollius
And Guydo eke de Columpnys
And Englysh Gaufryd eke ywys
And each of these as I have Joy
Was besy for to bear up Troy
So heavy was thereof the fame
That for to bear it was no game
But yet I began full well aspy^
Between hem was a lyt^l enuy^
Other said that Omer made lies
Faynyng in his poetryes
And was to the grekis favorable
Therefore held he it but fable
Tho saw I stand on a pyler
That was of tynned y^en cler
The latin poet Virgyle
That has bo^e up a long while
The fame of Pius Eneas
And next on a pyler was
Of Co^er / Venus clerk Ouyde
That has sown wonder wide
The great god of love / his fame
And there he bare up well his name
Upon this pyler / also hye
As I might see hit with mine ^ye
For which this halle / whereof I read
Was wax on heyght / length and bread
Well more by a thousand dele
Than it was erst / that saw I well
Tho saw I on a pyler by
Of iron wrought full sternly
The great poet dan Lucan
That on his sholdres bare up than
As hye as I might see
The name of Julius and Pompee
And by him stoden all these clerkis
That write of Romes mighty werkis
That if I would her names tell
Alto ^onge must I dwell
And then upon a pyler stood
Of Sulphur lyche as he were wode
Dan Claudian soth for to tell
That bare up all the fame of hell
Of Pluto and of Proserpyne
That queen is of the derke pyne
What should I more tell of this
The halle was al full ywys
Of hem that written old gestis
As ben in trees rokes nestis
Were all these gestes for to here
But it is a full confuse matere
That they of write and how they hight
But while that I beheld that sight
(...) a noise ^ ^prochen blyue
(...) fares as bees don in an hyue
Against her time of out coming
Right such a murmoryng
Fie all the world seemed me
Tho began I look about me and see
That there come entryng in to the halle
A right great company with all
And that of sundry regyons
Of all kyns conditions
That dwell in earth under the moon
Pour and rich and also sone
As they were come in to the halle
They gonne on knees down fall
Before this ylke noble queen
And seyde grant us lady shene
Ec^e of us / of thy grace a bone
And som^e of hem / she granted sone
And som^e she warned well and fay^
And som^e she granted the contray^
What there grace was I nyste
For of these folk full well I wyste
They had good fame each deserved
All though they were dyuersly served
Right as her suster dame fortune
Is wont to serve in Comune
Now herkne how she began to pay
Hem / that began her of grace pray
And yet lo / all this company
Seyden soth / and not a lie
Madame said they / we be
Folk / that here besechen the
That thou grant us now good fame
And let our works have good name
In full recompensacioun
Of good werkis / give us renoun
I warn you quod she anon
Ye get of me good fame non
By god / and therefore go your wey
Alas / quod they and weleawey
Tell us what your cause be
For me list not it / quod she
No wight shall speak ywys
Good ne harm / ne that ne this
And with that word she began to call
Her messager that was in halle
And bad that he should fast gone
Upon pain to be blind anon
For Eolus / the god of wind
Iy trace / there ye shall him find
And bid him bring his Claryon
That is full diverse of his sown
And it is cleped clear lawde
With which he wont is to herawde
Hem that me list y preysed be
And also bid him / how that he
Bring eke his other claryon
That hight sklaunder in every town
In which he wont is to deffame
Hem that m^ list / and do hem shame
This Messager began fast to goon
And fond where in a caue^ of stoon
In a contre that hight Trace
This Eolus with hard grace
Held the wyndes in dystresse
And began hem under him to press
That they gonne as the beres rore
He bond and pressed hem so sore
This messager began first cry
Rise up quod he / and fast the hye
Till thou at my lady be
And take thy clarions eke with the
And speed the fast / and he anon
Took to one that hight Triton
His claryon to beren tho
And let a certain wynd go
that blew so hydously and hye
That it left not a sky
In all the welkyn long and brood
This Eolus nowher a bood
Till he was come at fames fete
And eke the man that Tryton hete
And there he stood as still as stone
And here wythal there came anon
An other huge Company
Of old folk / and began to cry
Lady grant us now good fame
And let our werkys have that name
Now in honor and gentylnes
And also god your soul bles
For we han well deserved it
T^erfore is right / that we be quyt
As thryue I quod she ye shall faylle
Good werkis shall you not auaylle
To have of me good fame as now
But wot ye what / I grant you
That ye shall have a shrewd name
And wicked loos / and werse fame
Though ye good loos have well deseruyd
Now goth your w^y / for ye ben served
And thou dan Eolus / quod she
Take forth thy trompe anon let see
That is I cleped sklaunder light
And blow her loos / that every wight
Speak of hem harm and shrewdnes
An stead of good and worthynes
For thou shall trompe all the contrayre
That they have don / well and fair
Alas thought I what auentures
Have these sorry creatures
That they among all the pres
Should thus be shamed gyltles
But what it must needs be
What did this Eolus but he
Took out his black trompe of bras
That fowler than the devil was
And began this trompe for to blow
As all the world should over throw
Through out every regyoun
Went his foul trompes sown
As swyft as a pelet / out of a gonne
When fire is in to it run
And such a smoke / began out wend
Out of the foul trompes end
Black / blo / grenyssh / swartysh read
As does / when men melte led
Lo al on hye / from the well
And thereto one thing saw I well
That the fer there / that it ran
The gretter waxen / it began
As does the river from a well
And it stank / as the pyt of hell
Alas thus was her shame y ronge
And gyltles / on every tongue
Tho came the third company
And came up to the deys on hye
And down on knees / they fell anon
And seyden / they ben euerychon
Folk that han full trewly
Deserved fame rightfully
And prayed hit might be know
Right as it is and forth blow
I grant quod she for now me list
That now your good werkis ben wist
And yet ye shall have better loos
Right in despyte of all your foos
Than wor^hy is / and that anon
Let now quod she / thy trompe gone
Thou Eolus / that is so black
And out thyn other trompe take
That hight lawde / And blow it so
That through the world / her fame go
All esyly / and not to fast
That it be known at the last
Full gladly / lady mine he seyde
And out his trompe of gold he breyde
Anon / and set it to his mouth
And blewe it eest. west. and south
And north as loud as any thonder
That every wight has of it wonder
So broad it ran or that it stynte
And certes all the breath that went
Out of his trompe / it smellyd
As men a pyt full of bawme heled
Among a basket full of roses
This favor dy^e he to her looses
And right wy^h this I began espy
There came the four^h company
But certain they were wonder few
And gonne to stand on a rewe
And ^ayden cert^s lady bright
We have don well / with al our might
But we n^ keep to have fame
Hyde our werkys and our name
For gods love / for certes we
Have certain don hit for bounte
And for no manner other thing
I grant you all your askyng
Quod she / let all your werkys be deed
With that about I turned my head
And saw anon the first rowte
That to this lady began lowte
And down anon on knees fall
And her, tho besoughten all
To hyde her good werkys eke
And seyde they give not a leke
Foe fame ne such renoun
For they for comtemplacioun
And goddis love had it wrought
N^ of fame would they naught
What quod she / be ye wood
And wene ye to do good
And for to have of that no fame
Have ye despyte to have a name
Nay ye shall euerychon
Blow thy trompe and that anon
Quod she thou Eolus / I hot
And ring these folks werkis by note
That all the world may of it here
And he began blow here loos so clear
In his golden clarioun
That through the world went the soun
And so kyndely / and eke so soft
That their fame was blow a lofte
Tho came the syxt company
And began fast / to fame cry
Right verily in this manner
They sey den mercy lady dear
To t^lle certain as it is
We have don neither that ne this
But idle all our life has be
But netheles we pray the
That we may have so good a fame
And great renom^ and known name
As they that have do noble gestis
And eschewyd all her bestes
As well of love / as other thing
Al was us / never broche ne ring
Ne ellis what fro women sent
Ne ones in her heart y meant
To make us friendly chere
But might temen us upon bear
Yet let us to the people seem
Such as the world / may of us dem^
That wommen loved us for wode
That shall do us as much good
And to our heart as much avail
To counterpoyse ese and travail
^s we had won with labor
^or that is dear bought tresour
At regard of our great ese
And yet ye must us more plese
Let us behold eke thereto
Worthy wise / and good also
And rich and happy unto love
For gods love / that sytteth above
Though we may not the body hau^
Of womm^n / yet so god me save
Let men blow of us the name
Suffyseth us / that we have the fame
I grant quod she / by my truth
Now Eolus / wythouten slouthe
Take out thy trompe of gold quod she
And blow as they have axed me
That every man wene hem at ese
Though they goo in bad bese
This Eolus / began it so blow
That through the world it was know
Tho came the seventh rowte anon
And fyl on knees euerychone
And said lady grant us soon
The same thing the same bone
That to these next folk have done
Fie on you quod she euerychone
Ye masty Swyne / ye Idle wretches
Full of roten and slow triches
What false theuys / where ye would
Ben famous good / and no^hyng nolde
Deserve why ne never thought
Men rather you to hangen ought
For ye ^e like the slepy catte
That would have fyssh / but wost thou what
He will nothing wete his claws
Evil thryft come on your Jaws
And on mine / if I hit grant
Or do favor you to auaunte
Thou Eolus / ^hou ^yng of trace
Go blow thy^ folk a sorry grace
Quod she anon / and wost thou how
As I shall tell the right now
Say / ^hese ben they / that wolden honor
Have / and do no kyns labor
And do no good / and yet hem lawde
That men wend / that be^e I sawde
Ne could hem not of love werne
And yet she that grynt at querne
Is al to good to ese her heart
This Eolus anon up sterte
And with his black claryoun
Began to blasyn out a soun
As loud as bellyth wind in hell
And eke therwyth soth to t^lle
This sown was full of Iapes
As ever mowes were in Apes
And that wend the world about
That every wight began on hem shoute
And for to lawhe / as they were wood
Such game fond they in her mode
Tho came there another company
That had y done the trecherye
The harm and great wickedness
That every heart could guess
And prayed hem to have good fam^
And that she nolde do hem no shame
But give hem loos and good renoun
And do it blow in claryoun
Nay wys quod she / it were a vice
All be there in me no Justice
Me list not to do it now
Ne I no will grant it you
Tho came there crepyng in a rowte
And began clappe al abowte
Every man upon the Crown
That all the halle began sown
and said lady lyef and d^ee
We ben such folks as ye may here
To tell all the tale a right
We ben shrewys every wight
And have delight in wyckednes
As good folk have in godenes
And Joy to be known shrewes
And full of vice and wicked thewes
Wherefore we pray you on a row
That our fame be such y know
In all thing such as it is
I grant it you quod she ywys
But what art thou / that seyst this tale
That werest on thy hose a pale
And on thy typet such a belle
Madame quod he soth to tell
I am that ylke shrewe ywys
That burnt the temple of ysidis
In Athenes lo that cite
And wherefore dedest thou so quod she
By my truth quod he madame
I would fayn have had a fame
As other folk had / in the town
All though they were of great renoun
For her virtue and her thewes
Thought I / as great fame have shrewes
Though it be for Shrewdnes
As good folk have for goodness
And sythen I may not have that on
That other nyl I not forgoon
As for to get a fame here
The temple set I on fire
Now late our loos be blow swythe
As wysly be thou ever blythe
Gladly quod she / thou Eolus
Herest thou not / what they prayen us
Madame yes full well quod he
And I will trompen it parde
And took his black trompe fast
And began to puffen and to blaste
Till it was at worlds end
With that I began about wend
For one / that stood at my back
Me thought full goodly to me spack
And said friend what is thy name
Art thou come heder to have fame
Nay forsooth friend quod I
I come not hither gramercy
For no such cause by my head
Suffyse^h me / as I were deed
That no wight have my name in hand
I wot my self best how I stand
For what I dry or what I think
I will my self all hit drink
Certain for the more part
As ferforth as I can mine Art
What do thou here then quod he
Quod I that will I tell the
The cause why I stand here
Som^e new tidings forto lere
Som^e new thing I not what
Tidings either this or that
Of love or such things glade
For certeynly he that me made
To come heder said to me
I Should both here and see
In this place wonder things
But these be no such tidings
As I mente / no quod he
And I answerde / no parde
For well I wot / ever yet
Sith that first I had wit
That som^e folk / han desired fame
Dyuersly and loos and name
But certeynly I nyst ner how
Where that fame dwellyth / or now
Ne eke of her dyscripcion
Ne also of her condition
Ne the order of her dome
Knew I not till I hither come
Why than be loo these tidings
That thou now hither brynges
That thou have herd quod he to me
But now no force / for well I see
What thou desire for to here
Come forth and stand no longer here
And I will the wythouten dread
In to such another place led
There thou shall here many one
Tho began I forth with him goon
Out of the castle soth to say
Tho saw I stand in a valeye
Under a castle fast by
An house like to domus dedaly
That laborintus y cleped is
Nas made so wonderly ywys
Ne half so queyntly ywrought
And euermo as swyft as thought
This queynt house about went
That neuermo still it stente
And there come out so great a noise
That if I had stand upon oyse
I might it have herd easily
To rome I trow sikyrly
And the noise which I had herd
For all the world right so it f^rd
As does the rowtyng of the stone
That fro thengyne is leten gone
And al this house of which I read
Was made of twigs falow read
And grene eke / and som^e were whyt^
Such as men to these gates thwyte
Or maken of these paners
Or else hattes or dossers
They were a chekked both two
And neither of him might out goo
And with the noise of them woe Caxton

I Suddenly awoke anon tho
And remembryd what I had se^n
And how hye and far I had been
In my ghoost / and had great wonder
Of that the god of thonder
Had let me known / and began to write
Like as ye have herd me endyte
Wherefore to study and read always
I purpose to do day by day
Thus in dremyng and in game
Ends this lytyl book of Fame
Explicit
I find no more of this work to fore said / For as f^r as I can understood /
This noble man Gefferey Chaucer fynysshyd at the said conclusion of the metyng
of lesyng and sothsawe / where as yet they ben chekked and may not depar^e /
which work as me seems is craftyly made / and dygne to be wreton and known
/ For he towchyth in it right great wysedom and subtle understanding / And so
in all his werkys he excellyth in mine oppynyon all other writers in our
Englyssh / For he wrytteth no void words / but all his matter is full of hye
and quycke sentence / to whom ought to be given laud and preysynge for his
noble making and writing / For of him all other have borrowed sith and taken /
in all their well saying and writing / And I humbly beseech and pray you /
emonge your prayers to remember his soul / on which and on all christian
soul^s I beseech almighty god to have mercy Amen
