A Mirrhor mete for all Mothers, Matrones, and Maidens, entitled the Mirrhor
of Modesty, no less profitable and pleasant, then necessary to be read and
practiced.



Imprinted at London for Edward White, at the little Northdore of Paul's at the
Sign of the Gun.

TO THE RIGHT virtuous Matrone, and singular good Lady Anne, wife to the right
worshipful sir Thomas Lodge knight, E. W. wishes long life, and prosperous
estate.
Having alo^g time debated with my self (my very good Lady) after the copy of
this Pamphlete was come into my hands, too whom I might best dedicate the
same, your L. at last came to my remembrance, as the Lady too whom I did
know my self to be so greatly beholden, by many received courtesses, that I
could not but confess my self bound to be mindful of requital, to the
vttermoste of my power, and therefore notyng the title that it bears, being
the Mirrhor of Modesty, I knew none so worthy, (at least to whom I was
indetted of duty) as your Ladyship to be patroness hereof, because that the
virtue whereof it bears the title, does so gloriously shine in you, as
very Envy her self cannot but confess (much rather a right demyng mind)
that it is your desarte to have it, both for affirmyng that which is
contained therein (by your life) to be laudable, and also to incorage other by
your supporte to follow your stepps, to attain to your atchiued fame. Wherefore
although the gift be far unable, to gratify the least part of the favor I
have found, yet I have boldly presumed too present it unto you, as being
assured (considering your courteous Nature) of courteous acceptance, and the
rather because it is a Mirrhor to teach Maidens to be Modest, whereof you have
always been a Mistress, and therefore may the better judge if it be well
wrought, by perusyng it at your best leisure, which not doubtyng but ye will
do. I cease from further troublynge you, with my duetifull commendations, and
daiely intercession to the Almighty, for the happy estate, and prosperity of
your Ladishippe, that am your worshippes most bounden E. W.

The Epistle to all Mothers, Matrones, and Maidens of England.
IN seeing right honorable Mothers, and virtuous Matrones the great abuse
that by the default of good brynging up, many of our English Maidens do
daiely run into, to the great reproach of their Parents, hearts greef of
their kinsfolk, infamy of their persons, and (which is most to be
lamented) loss of their souls, I thought it no less then my bounden duty
to take in hand this little work, Entitled the Mirrhor of Modesty, to the
end that by looking in the same, both such Mothers and Matrones, as have
charge of children and youth under them, may know the only ready means, by
the help of Gods grace so to instruct them, as no doubt great amendment
will ensue, and also all Maidens and young Children them selves, see the
direct and straight pathe to perpetual felicity, wherefore what so ever
herein is written, I beseech you as friendly to accept, as it is willyngly
offered: For trust me not of Pride, or vainglorie (as thinking my self the
only sufficient manne to write upon so worthy a matter have I made this
enterprise, but I have dooen it part for recreation, part for goodwill, on
hope to see amendment, and that which is the cheefeste part, to provoke some
far better able them I, by seeing my little volume so freendly accepted, to
take in hand a larger and pithier piece of work, touching the same sense and
meaning: My request therefore is simple to judge, faithfully to reap,
willyngly to keep, and heartily to observe all that which follows, to your
own profit, my comfort, and Gods high glory, to whom be all honor, Majesty
and power, for ever and ever.

Amen.
The Mirrhor of modesty meet for all Mothers and ancient Matrones to look
in, to deck their young daughters and maidens minds by: Made by T. S
FOr as much as the weakness of our nature is such, as we are more
inclined and prone to imitate and follow those things that be hurtful unto
us, then those that be good and profitable. In my judgment there is nothing
more meet, especially for young Maidens then a Mirrhor, there in to see and
behold how to order their dooyng, I mean not a Crystal Mirrhor, made by
handie Art, by which Maidens now adays, do only take delight daiely to
trick and trim their tresses, standing tootyng two hours by the Clock,
lookyng now on this side, now on that, least any thing should be lackyng
needful to further Pride, not sufferyng so much as a hare to hang out of
order, no I mean no such Mirrhor, but the Mirrhor I mean is made of an other
manner of matter, and is of much more worth then any Crystal Mirrhor; for as
the one teaches how to attire the outward body, so the other guides to
garnishe the inward mind, and makes it meet for virtue, and therefore is
entitled a Mirrhor, meet for Matrones and Maidens, for Matrones to know how
to train up such young Maidens as are committed to their charge and tuission,
and for Maidens how to behave them selves to attain to the seat of good fame.
For although that a number of them before whom this Mirrhor may come, be
branches sprung from so virtuous a tree, or brooks discendyng from so sweet
a Fountain, as there is no doubt but the branches and brooks will be like
unto the breeders. Yet (the more pity) we see oftentimes proof to the
contrary, the cause whereof can not be thought to proceade, but by want of
good instruction. As it is not only evident to be seen in men that are
reasonable, but in things that are reasonlesse, yea (not straiyng from my
example) in Plants, for they by wantyng the continual care and diligence,
that is necessary for them, are seen to lack their natural force and virtue,
and finally become wild. Likewise the horse by default of well teaching and
trainyng up, will lose a great part of his gallant majesty, whereto naturally
he is inclined. So that by how much the more the likelihoode of any maiden is
of virtue, by so much the more ought there a care and diligence to be had in
conseruyng her, as a thing precious and of great valor, and therefore I wish
al Mothers and Matrones not to be so careless, as not trustyng any other thing
that they have, of little or no estimation at all, but under the sauegarde and
sure keepyng of careful and trusty folk, will nevertheless commit their
children at adventure to the tuission of such, as either by too dainty an
entreatie, will corrupt their tender minds, or by too importunate a rudeness,
drive them into indecent fearfulness, yea, per adventure into disdain and
hate of such things, as ought to be followed and loved. Therefore concerning
the Matrone to whom any young Maiden is to be committed (I say) she ought what
so ever she be, to be Grave, Prudent, Modest, and of good counsel, to the end
that such Maidens as she has in tutyng, may learn her honest and womanly
demeanoure, and sure she ought especially, and above all things, beware that
their tender minds, replenished with divine beauty and bounty, be not
corrupted by seeing indecent demeanours. Touching the Maiden desirous of good
fame, if she being by* Nature of beautiful form, in deakyng herself by a
Crystal Mirrhor, will be sure not to suffer (as before I said) so much as a
spot, if she espies it upon her face, the beauty of which is most frail,
and fades like a flower in short space: how ought her mind, in which is
represented the true Image of God, to be kept not only from great spotof
sin, but from the lest that is, likewise such garments as be gallant*
garnisht with gold, which (notwithstanding, how gorgeous so ever they be to
the eye, are but dirt and dross,) we see both Mothers and Mistresses to be so
curious as so nere as they can, they will not permit so much as a mote to
remain upon them, and yet God he knows they be so necligent, and careless
over their Daughters, and Maidens (the most part of them) as they never
regard or respect their behauioures, to the end that if they be bad, they
may amend them, or if good so continewe them, but as though the care of their
well teaching and traynyng up, did not appertain or belong to them, they let
them pass, but alas, what should I talk of Mothers, yea or of Fathers, seeing
that for the most part, although they them selves be wise, and grave of
Judgment, yet their virtue, and Prudence, is overcome and blinded by
affection, therefore I think it more meet and conuement, for Parents to set
their Children forth to be taught, but under whom? under every one that bears
the name of a teacher. Noe, but in that respect they are to do, as if they
were to make choice of some Painter, to take in hand to draw their own
picture, to do the which there is no doubt, but they would seek and search
out, so nigh as they could, him that is most famous and excellent in that art,
and so ought they to do, and with much more care in sekyng such as they will
commit their children unto, to be instructed, because by their instruction and
trainyng up, they are* forever to be made or marde. Now to the end ye may
know the Mistress meet to take charge over children* I will discribe her
unto you by particular qualities, and so for the orderly the qualities meet to
be taught every maiden.

First, she that does take upon her, too train up any young maiden, ought to
be indewed with so singular Prudence, as that (which others can hardly
perceive in long continuance of time) she taught by the looks and behauioure
of the Maid, may sone discern, and see what is to be hoped, and what feared
in her, and so preventing at the beginning by brief* and expedient remedies,
that which she fears, shall with mild and Prudent instructions, nourisheing
that which she has good hope of bring her in short time to perfectness.
Moreover for so much as there is greater danger, in that which is feared,
then profit in that which is hoped, our Matrone ought before all things
carefully to cut from her heart, all that which she fears in her to be
evil. Imitatyng therein the wise and expert labourer, who never sows Corn
in any ground, that he knows to be good and fertile, before he has first
diligently purged and rooted up such evil weeds, Thorns and brambles, as
are over grown therein, which dooen, yet she may not leave her care and
diligence, but after that she has taken from her heart the most that she can
all that, which hinders in her the augmentation of virtue, and therein has
sown the seeds of the same and seen it spring her second care shall be to take
heed, least (as often times young and tender plants, not stayed with firm and
strong proppes, shaken with the blustryng winds, do fall to the earth, lose
their vigor, and in the end wither and dye) the virtue that has taken a
little root in her heart, being shaken somtymes by tempests of affections,
and not having firm and sure proppes to staieit, do perish. Which thing
that it may come to pass in short space, will sufficiently appear to him that
is in doubt, by considering that not only in youth, when the seeds of virtue
are new sown in their minds, but also in ripe age, when as virtue does
florishe and increase, there is great need of such, as by their wisdom and
instruction may sustain and govern them, until such time as virtue has
taken deep root in them, and then (as we see a strong and sturdie Oak to
stand stiff and immouable against the blustrous blastes of fierce winds) so
in their hearts how boisterous so ever the tempestious blastes of human
affections do blow, it is not to be doubted but virtue will abide without
mouyng, or rootyng out; now because it has been said before, that a wise and
prudente Matrone ought to know that which is to be feared, and likewise
hoped for in a Maid, she shall come to the same by grave and wise counsel,
and by using the like policy that Ulisses did (who for to get knowledge of
Achilles being trained up in company of Licomedes daughters in women's attire)
among many other gallant knackes meet for Maidens, did make show of weapons,
meet for knights, whereon Achilles had no sooner cast his eyes, but presently
he leaft the triflyng toys of women, and fell too handlyng of them, by which
Ulisses knew him. Thus she shall sone perceive whereto she is inclyned, yet
shall she not present unto her any vicious thing, in blamyng or detestyng it,
but shall set before her the contrary virtues, giving high commendation to
the good, and utter dispraies to the bad. Also our good Matrone shall give her
to understand, how goodly a beauty and gallant ornament chastity is in a
young Maiden, and if it apperes that she leaves her ear unto such prays, and
by semblance, desiereth not only too seem such a one, but to be such a
one, the signs will be evident, that her heart has in horroure the contrary
crimes. But if our Matroue, perceive by signs that she is bent otherwise, then
wisely, and prudently (taking occasion the most advisedly she can) she shall
discource unto her, the lives of some renowned Ladies, who lived vertuouslye,
and thereby purchased immortal fame and renown, but before I pass any
farther, I will stay too show the use of many unwise Fathers, who being more
daintye, and effeminate in followyng their pleasures, then wise and diligent in
seeking the profit of their Daughters, do give them, so sone, as they have
any understanding in readyng, or spellyng, to cone and learn by heart books,
ballades, Songs, sonettes, and Ditties of daliance excityng their memories
thereby, being then most apt to retain for ever, that which is taught them,
to the same manner of order, for the hearts of youth, are therein to be
compared to new vessels, which for ever will keep the savor and taste, of
that licore where with it is first filled and seasoned, therefore I would wish
our good Matrone to eschew such use, as apestilent infection, for no doubt the
weak age of youth, and evil conversation of many, geues copious, and
abundant matter enough to evil, and much more then wise Parents would wish,
I am sure without need to be taught it so long time before, but in steed of
such books and lascivious ballades, our wise Matrone, shall read or cause
her Maidens to read, the examples and lives of godly and virtuous Ladies,
whose worthy fame, and bright renown, yet lives and still will live for ever,
which she shall make choice of, out of the holy Scripture, and other
histories both ancient and of late days which, books will not only delight
them, but as a spur it will prick and incite their hearts, to follow virtue,
and have vice in horror and disdain, yea their minds by that means, not
only of those that are grown to ripenes of years and strength of nature, but
also those of tender and young age, will be come noble and magnaminous thereby,
for you shall never repeat the virtuous lives of any such Ladies as, Claudia,
Portia, Lucretia and such like were, but you shall kindle adesire in them to
tread their steps, and become in time like unto them, and too disdain and
have in horror those that to the contrary, pas the course of their lives in
wickedness, and not only shall our Maiden be forbidded, to read any such
books or ballades, as may make her mind (being of it self very delicate)
more feeble and effemynate, but also from all those things that any way may
make her unworthy of a laudable reputation, among which, it is not to be
thought how hurtful and dangerous, the acquaintance and famyliaritie of young
gossopes is, who under couerture, of Ientillitie, gallant attire, and costly
ornaments, or (which is most infectious) under fained Religion and honesty,
do hide corrupt and wicked manners, and yet such as are evil may easily be
known, when the authority of great personages supporte them, and even as a
disease is then most contagious, when those that are infected, have a color
lively, and most likely to be healthful, so vice hide under Ientillitie and
honor, and covered with the visor of falce semblance, and feined honesty,
does hurt much more, then when the evil life or leude behavior of such
personages, are discovered and made manifest; but I think it not necessary,
to admonish our Matrone after the manner of some, to be so strickte to her
Maidens, as to withdraw them from the acquaintance and familiarity of
children, how be it that they be of like age, although that in the same age
the seed of Sin no doubt springs, and the fruit thereof in little time
ripeneth, and increases too abundantly, which thing the learned and grave
Doctor of great authority saint Jerome shows by example of a shameless
harlot, who more brutishlie then any reasonlesse beast, would make booste and
vauntyng bragges of her lascivious life, saying, that since she could remember
in her youngest years, the filthy pleasure of flesh was not dainty unto her:
oh horrible brag, oh execrable booste, and most damnable life: well our
prudente Matrone to remove such detestable dangers from her young Maidens,
shall in nowise permit the^, to have acquaintance with kitchine Servants, or
such idle housewiues, as commonly and of custom, do thruste them selves
into the familiarity of those of good calling, and under color of
freendlinesse, do oftentimes work great mischeef, and are therefore to be
avoided and shonned, as infectious diseases, for sure there is no one thing so
unseemly, for a young maiden of good calling, or more hurtful to her good fame
and name then to be seen and heard among such as I before mentioned,
tattlyng, and tellyng of foolish tales by the fire side, but instead thereof,
I mean of tellyng or hearing of fables told in such company, our Matron
shall cause them that are committed young into her government, to propounde in
the company of womanly Maidens, and so nere as she can in her own presence,
pithie questions, and grave sentences, to pose one an other, and sometimes tell
the lives of godly Uirgines, and the Matrone her self to delight them, who of
necessity ought to be stored with studied demaundes, and witty arguments,
shall modestly entermeddle her self among them, and to them in whom she sees
any desarte, she shall to encourage the other, yield commendation, and so make
them all strive to attain to the like, and it would not be amiss, seeing that
the continual presence of her that is a Maistres, by her great gravity and
virtuous usage, does rather inge^der in a good mind affection of reverence,
then occasion of bold wantonness, the which more appears in youth, then in
ripe age, if she made choice among many of some modest, and well behauoured
Maiden, who not only by virtuous demeanor, shall give the rest occasion to
imitate her virtue, but also be unto them recreatiue, and delightful in
grave and weighty causes, for there be some things, which sometimes do
seem unto some very sharp and noisome, although that of Nature delightful,
and of their proper obiecte do delight the senses, and do move with singular
pleasure, that age more then any other, which thing if it be truth, as it
certainly seems, how much ought our Matrone to take heed, that it happens
not in those things, in which there is no delight at all. Well, as a wise
Matrone should (seeing that in children, the strength of understanding cannot
be so great, as they may always be troubled with grave matters) this our
Matrone shall (at least if she will do well) entermedle honest mirthe with
grave matter. And also if at any time there be any Maiden worthy of
correction, let the Mistress rather incline in her chastenyng to mildness,
then madness, favor then fury, and rightly use the part of a good Phisitio^,
who to cure young children of their corporal maladies, do give them wormwood,
or such like bitter thing, anointed over with Honey, to the end that they
deceived by the upper sweetness, may swallowe down the wholesome bitterness,
and thereby receive help of their disease. More over our good Matrone, shall
show to her Maidens a modest merry countenance continually, and if they do
evil rebuke them in such sort, as although it be not with bitter words, or
sharp stripes, yet they shall well know, they have offended greatly,
reseruyng cruelty for the last remedy, and yet the same to be then also of
little induraunce, least that which should serve for a remedy used to often,
becomes scorned and nothing esteemed, as the old Proverb is, To much of any
thing, is good for nothing.

Besides when any Maiden is driven into a tremblyng fear, by her mistress
sudden sharp frownyng as no doubt some, being of mild and gentill Natures
will be sone, our good Matrone shall presently change her sower lowryng into a
sweet smylyng, and with gentle and virtuous informations, and cherefull
promises put her out of fear, for in no wise I would wish any too be over
pressed by fear, because thereby many become even simple like fools, and
whereas some parents be of opinion that it is necessary for Maidens, to be
skillful in Philosophy Moral and Natural, thinkyng it an honor unto them
to be thought well learned, I for my part am the contrary because that by the
same, they are made to understand the euelles immynente too human life, yea
thereby is opened unto them, the inclynations and pronenesse, which naturally
even from our cradles we have unto vice, which knowledge is not requisite to
be in young women. Likewise the examples of evil and wicked men, the corrupt
lives and lewd customs of those that have conversation with us, the heaps of
pleasures, pastymes, delights, and recreations, and the deceites and guiles of
our ghostly enemy from the which we see how the wary wise man can hardly
defend him self (I leave the young and tender virgin) with the protection
and armoure of great learning: too which, or against which if I should
flatly answer, that the evil use of learning has more often times been
cause of discommodytie and damage, then the right and laudable use of it has
been of profitte and benyfite, I should per adventure be suspected of some for
such a one as did the same to the derogation, slander, and reproof of
learning, which thing I utterly deny, and yet I can allege infinite examples
to prove my proportion, as first, Room the chief City and seat of the
worldly empire, and victorious over all Nationes, I can approve, and bring in
acuthoritie, that it has been six hundredth years and more without the
knowledge of Letters, and also that from thence all Philosophers by public
proclamations were exiled, as corruptors of good and virtuous life:
Contrariwise, when the study of Philosophy and Eloquence flourished therein,
it lost liberty, and finally fell into the servitude and obedience of one
man. Also the city of Athens (which above all other was named to have got
the glory, and renown for learning, and teaching of wisdom to the world)
at such time as the Accademia, the Portico, and the Licio was most celebrated
by the frequentation of noble and famous Philosophers, fell into servitude and
subjection, and therefore in the same the use of Eloquence was prohibited, as a
ruin and Pestilence to the publicque weal, and maime to Law and Justice.
Likewise Sparta might be brought in, for that along time, whiles it had
Eloquence in horror and hate, thinkyng the use of it more meet for effeminate
and wanton idle men, then for courageous and warlike cha^pions, it flourished as
cheef of all Greece with great glory, but because I have taken in hand to
instruct a Christian Maiden, laiyng aside al other examples, I might bring in
the example of our Savior, that Rock of infallible verity, who utterly
blamed the wisdom of the world, as enemy to good life and religion. But my
intent is not, neither was it ever, to attribute such evil as springs from
the malice of wicked men, and their corrupt nature, to the sacred study of
learning, to which I have given my mind so much as in me lay all my life
time. But my purpose is to prove that in a virtuous Uirgine, and modest Maiden,
such use is more dangerous and hurtful, then necessary or praise worthy.
Some perhaps will allege that a Maiden being well learned, and able to search
and read sonderie aucthors, may become chaste and godly, by readyng the
godly and chaste lives of diverse: but I answer who can deny, that, seeing of
her self she is able to read and understand the Christian Poets, too wete,
Prudentio, Prospero, Iuuenco, Pawlino, Nazianzeno, and such like, that she
will not also read the Lascivious books, of Ouide, Catullus, Propercius,
Tibullus, and in Uirgill of Eneas, and Dido, and among the Greek Poettes of
the filthy love (if I may term it love) of the Gods themselves, and of
their wicked addulteries and abominable Fornications, as in Homer and such
like, and to the same also (seeing that Parents will be so Ambicious, as they
will take delight to see their daughters dispute in Philosophers Schools) who
can warrant that when it seems good unto her, that she will not as well
defend the peruerst oppinion of the Epicure, as the same of Zeno, and
Chrysippus, there be some that among a few learned Ladies, will allege per
adventure Cornelia to be excellent, she that was Mother unto the two Gracchi
noble Citezens of Rome, and yet that Lady as it is known that she taught her
Sons to be no less sedicious and violent, then eloquent and learned. So
taught she her Daughter (as some grave authors have judged) to put her husband
to death, in whom the magnificence and Majesty of that Empire consisted. Unto
the Ladies of Lelius was no greater co^mendacion given then they could speak
wisely in their Mother toungue. Likewise Portia, the wife of Brutus was not
half so much commended, for having learned of her Father, the Doctrine, and
decrees of the Stoicall Philosophers (which nevertheless no ancient Author
affirm) as she was for keeping loyalty and faith to her husband, and for
being of a patient and noble mind, a meet virtue for the Daughter of Cato,
who was her Father. As touching Mantinea, Assiothea, and Lasthemia (I leave to
talk of Leontium that defended fleshly pleasure against Theophrastns) who
changed their womanly attire, and entered manlike in to the Schools of
Plato, and there among amorous and Lascivious youth disputed of the mouyng of
Principles and of causes, or Damma, who taught to the world the doctrine of
Pithagoras her father, or Aspatia, or Diotima, or Thargelia who were famous in
the study of Philosophy, they I say never got so much fame by their
learning, as they did defame, for their dishonest and loss living. And sure I
suppose there is no Man of reason and understanding, but had rather love a
Maiden unlearned and chaste, theu one suspected of dishonest life, though never
so famous and well learned in Philosophy. Wherefore I wish all Parents too
beware and take heed, how they suffer their young Daughters being frail of
Nature, to be bold disputers, and to the end I may not be thought naked of
examples to prove the contrary, I maintain (seeing it behooves me more to
contend with authority then reason) that where these obstinate defendoures
of learning to be meet and necessary in women, can bring in one example, I
will allege a number to the contrary. For the Histories as well ancient as of
those of late days are full of the Noble factes and renowned deeds done by
rare and Excellent Ladies, which as well for their noble courage and
magnanimous hearts as for their chaste and virtuous lives have been and for ever
wilbee most Famous and renowned in the world, and yet had no learning, as it
has been seen, both in Sparta, Rome, Persia, Phocia, Chios, Argiua, and
diverse other places, whose names have been celebrated in time past, and to our
time present have leaft behind them more matter to wright on touching their
virtue, then ever either Erinua, Sappho, or Corinna, did write them selves of
excellent and famous men. And who is it that will deny that it is not more
prays and honnour too do noble deeds, then to write of them, sure I think
none, I am therefore of this advise, that it is not mete nor convenient for a
Maiden to be taught or trained up in learning of human arts, in whom a
virtuous demeanor and honest behavior, would be a more sightlier ornament,
then the light or vain glory of learning, for in learning and studiyng of the
arts there are two things finally proposed unto us, that is recreation and
profitte, touching profitte, that is not to be looked for, at the hands of
her that is given us for a companion in our labors, but rather every woman
ought wholelie to be active and diligent about the government of her household
and family, and touching recreation by learning that cannot be granted her,
without great danger and offense to the beauty and brightness of her mind;
seeing then that the government of estates and public weals are not committed
into the hands of women, neither that it is lawful or co^uement for them to
wright laws, by which men should be ruled and governed, as Draco, Licurgus,
and Numa Pompilius did, neither as professors of Science and faculty, to
teach in Schools the wisdom of Laws and Philosophy, and seeing also that
in such studies, as yeldeth recreation and pleasure, there is no less
danger, that they will as well learn to be subtle and shameless Lovers, as
connyng and skillful writers, of Ditties, Sonnetes, Epigrames, and Ballades,
let them be restrained to the care and government of a family, and teach
them to be envious in followyng those, that by true virtue have made little
accoumpte of those, that to the prejudice of their good names, have been
desirous to be reputed Diotimes, Aspaties, Sapphoes, and Corinnes. For such
as compare the small profit of learning with the great hurt and damage that
comes to them by the same shall sone perceive (although that they remain
obstinate therein) how far more convenient the Distaffe, and Spindle, Nedle and
Thimble were for them with a good and honest reputation, then the skill of well
using a pen or wrightyng a lofty vearce with disfame and dishonor, if in
the same there be more erudition then virtue; moreover who is he that will
doubt that the Maid, will not become perfitte and well accomplished (how be
it that it be hard to be believed, seeing that now adays they be wedded and
committed to the government of a household so young) which in company, and by
the instruction of many both wise and virtuous and by long experience have
been taught the manner, how to govern a household wisely, sure I will never
condiscende that any Maiden surmounting in her self the estate of an active
wife, or for too name her by one word Econemicall, should by climyng up the
Ladder of natural Philosophy, being so difficile, adventure to get to the
contemplatio^ of such things, as rather of idle men, which have bin many
years exercised in readyng, is to be desired then hoped for. But for so much
as the hope of such things are obtained with so great danger, and that in
all other faculties, which are to be got by practice and knowledge (having to
make choice) such are sooner chosen, that they are informed to have small
knowledge, and great experience, then those that have great knowledge, and
small practice, I think it necessary that Maidens be committed no otherwise,
under the care and charge of a wise and prudente Matrone, who by long use is
become skillful and expert, then if to be transported into a strange and
far Country, and would commit our gooddes and Marchaundize to a wise and
expert Mariner, making little account of him, that only by information of
the Astrolabie, or the Cards of Ptolomie do promise us (having never
travailed from home) sure sauegarde, it ought to suffice that a Maiden, being
become wise, by the instruction and teaching of her prudent Mistres, does give
good hope that in time when occasion shall serve, she will be sufficient to
govern a household and family discretely. And yet notwithstanding all this, I
would not have a Maiden altogether forbidden, or restrained from reading, for
so much as the same is not only profitable to wise and virtuous women, but
also a rich and precious Jewel, but I would have her if she read, to read
no other books but such as be written by godly Fathers, to our instruction
and souls health, and not such lascivious Songs, filthy Ballades, and
indecent books as be most commonly now a days set to sale, to the great
infection of youth, the names of which to recite would require a long time,
and to write a great volume being more pleasant then profitable, long then
learned, gallant then godly. Wherefore leauyng them as unworthy to be
mentioned, I would have our Maiden, I mean her that will attire her mind by
this Mirrhor to read, (if she delight to be a reader) the holy scripture, or
other good books, as the books of Plutarche, made of such renowned and
virtuous women as lived in time paste, and those of Boccas tendyng to the same
sense or some other, nerer to our time, and let her in readyng, consider what
she read, for in them she shall not only read words, which if they be
not garnished with good examples, be naught worth. But also godly deeds and
holy enterprises of virtuous Uirgines and worthy Women, by which she may
increase and augmente her virtue by immytatyng their lives. Let her read I
say and with the same print in her mind the lives of such noble Ladies as
lived in Troie, Sabina, Phocia, Argiua, and Rome, for no doubt she shall
learn great example of pity to her Country, by Megestona, Aretaphila,
Tolicreta, and by Judith and Hester. And true love and loialtie to their
housbandes by Lucres, Portia, and Camma, in so^me to make an end of strangers,
she shall find example of virtue, Religion, and holiness in a number of
Uirgines, as in Cicile, Agathe, Theodore, Barbara, and infinite other who with
the prise of their bloudes, did suffer incredible torments, for the profession
of a godly faith. And above all for delight, if she love to be delighted in
virtue, let her read that worthy book of Martyrs, compiled by that famous
Father and worthy man of God master Fox. Now to return to our Matrone, I
would wish her to frame in the minds of them that she takes to govern, a
true Religion and piety, auoidyng wholly superstition, as a capital
Pestilence. I trust that at this present, in which time especially among us
here in England, where the Gospel is so freely and sincerely preached, I
need not to declare from the beginning to the end, where in the one is
different from the other, I mean true religion, from falce superstition, for
so much as I think there be but few at least of any age, that are ignorant
how Religion is a virtue which consists in mediocritie, the which even as
it has on the one side impiety, which is one of the extremities, so has it
on the other side superstition, no less pernicious then impiety. Which thing
I would wish our Matron to make manifest to our Maiden, among other things
appertinente to a Christian, also she shall enforce her to be humble, and lowly
of heart, because that humility is not only a Christian and civil virtue,
but the very Foundation and Pilloure of all Christian and civil verteous, for
it ingendreth in us, the knowledge of our selves (as much as our weakness
may or can comprehend) and therefore it will give her the understanding of
gods Sapience, Bounty, and Puissance (which she ought to know to be infinite,
not only in creatyng the whole world by admirable ordynance of nothing, and
fillyng and garnishyng it with great ^^rietie of all things, but in
conseruyng it in the same being by eternal and divine Providence) and it will
not only show her that all that which may be in a young Maiden, but all that
which may be in Kings and Emperors, and all that which was in them that in
time paste sprounge out of the Licio, Portico, or Accademia with fame and
renown to be wise, in comparison of that which God may or can, and
esteeming all that which by any manner of means may in us have the name of
bounty and goodness compared to that of gods, is most abominable
wickedness, and to do this our wise Matrone shall set before her all that
which may be learned by godly men, and by daily instructions shall teach
her that our Savior Christ, came not into the world to be served but to
serve, and that he said to his Apostles that were at strife for the highest
place, that he which was greater then the other should be inferior, and that
he which humbled him self should be exalted, which is, that they only were
lifted up that knew them selves, which divine virtue has not only been
laudable among Christians. But in Socrates it was a sign of singular wisdom
in that he rightly adjudged him wise which knew him self to know nothing,
and no doubt our Maiden may casely attain to this virtue, if our Matrone do
but carefully instruct her, to take heed, not only too those that be more
noble then her self, and more mighty or more rich, but (which is of more
greater importance) to those that be the most virtuous and wise, and not
unto the wanton and wicked, as the world commonly use by which she shall
find and reap double profit and commodity, for she knowing that in the
world there be many noble Ladies, and rich Dames inferior to her, she
shall abate in her self that which before was in her of hautinesse and
arrogancy, a vice sure noisome, and taking heed to the virtuous, shall so
much as it lies in her, endeavor her self to attain to the same virtue,
whereof she knows she has want. Likewise our Matrone shall show to our
Maiden how foul, filthy, unseemly and disorderly a thing it is, for any woman
to learn every day of an other woman (being abroad and seeing them that are
brauest attired) how to trick and trim up them selves after the most newest
and gallantest fashion, to set out their bodily beauty; and will not, but
as careless, have respect to the semely and comely virtues and precious
ornaments of the mind, for which, wise and worthy women are highly
accoumpted of. But now adays it seems to some, and that to the most part,
that it is a godly orname^t, and a brave setting out to a young Maiden, if she
among the rest can she we her self, to be an excellent fine singer, or a
cunnyng plaier upon Instruments, which thing, although it be confirmed by
some galla^t glosyng reasons: I for my part do not only discommende, but
judge that a thing of no little danger, which ought in all women to be
eschewed. For as Music if it be used to a laudable and good intention, has
no evil in it, but deserves a place emoug the other Arts, the which
appertainyng properly to men, be called Liberal: Yet notwithstanding, under
the shadow of virtue (as for the most part a lother Arts and faculties, be
foolishely acknowledged for virtues) it bears a sweet bait, to a sour and
sharp evil. Therefore I wish our Maiden, wholly to refrain from the use of
Music, and seeing that under the couerture of Virtue, it opens the door to
many vices, she ought so much the more to be regarded, by how much the more
the danger is great, and less apparent. I must confess that the use of
singing and delicate plaiyng upon Instruments and sweet harmony is
necessary, but for whom? For those that be ouerworne with greef, sorrow,
trouble, cares, or other vexasion, have need of recreation, as Agame^non had
in Homer, and Saul in the holy Scripture, by the Harp and sweet syngyng of
David, who therewith pacified his fierce and furious passions, and revoked them
to a mild and quiet Spirit, but in stead of vsyng it to so good an
intention, it is converted to a poison, for it is only at bankettes and
feasts, to which as if the delicious and sweet meats, did not sufficiently
effeminate the minds of men and women: the excellentest Musicians are called,
where to the sweet accordes of sondrie Instruments, often times artificial
lascivious songs are adjoined thereby, no other wise, then as dried wood being
laid on the fire with little blowyng, will kindle and burn, to kindle in
their hearts the flames of leude affections, that are not yet strongly stayed
up by virtue, and by such new devises to burn them. It is said, that from
the false sweetness of the Sirens songs. Ulisses a Prince famous among the
Greeks, and said to be nourished with heavenly food, in the very bosom of
Sapiencs Jupiters daughter, could hardly escape, and shall we then without
fear, give so much trust to a young Maiden, daintely and tenderly trained up,
that she not only by hearing, but by learning so wanton an Art, will not
become wanton and effeminate.

Plato very wisely did think it a thing of great importance, among the
customs of Citizens, to set down what manner of Music Citezens might use.
Of which the City of Lacedemon yeldes ample witness, which (wholly
abhorryng all such Music, as might make their minds feeble or effeminate)
choose the same which yeeldyng a manly and a magnanimuous sound, made men
courageous, hot, and desirous of immortal glory, and defended it self in
such wise many years from corruptiou: Likewise Licurgus a Prince of great
wisdom and learning, would not but in time of war, and in battle have any
Music, and the same was such, as animated and incited the minds of men to
the defeuce of their Countries and Commonweals, and did moderate the
unmoderate mouynges of the body, to the end that by just measure and due
order, they might march against their enemies, where the dainty Music,
which we now adays commonly and only use for delight, did seem unto him (as
truly it is) able to engender in the hearts of men the contrary, how be it,
that they be of valiaunte and noble courage, and therefore did banishe such
Music, as would make hardy men cowardes. And not only in that City (in
which by a long time, such pleasure had no place, as brought other Cities,
yea only the same that was the Empire of the whole world to ruin) but in
Athens also, in which all other sorts and kinds of delights and pleasures
have been invented, as of lowable Arts and Sciences, the same was prohibited.
Alcibiades feelyng in his mind a merueilous sweet accord of divine harmony,
by the sacred study of Philosophy, disdained as of a noble courage this
dainty Art, the which to our great hurt and hinderaunce, by so much the
less it is unknown to us, by so much the more it delights and pleases us.
But to the end it may not seem, that I have of a determined and set
purpose, undertaken to beat Music down, I grant it necessary unto those
that can not, or have not wherewith better to imploye, or pass out their idle
time, and yet surely in my mind and judgment Philip of Macedon did very
wisely reprove his son Alexander, in saying that he had profited too much in
Music, and was therein become to excellent, and that to other it might seem
meet to be a Musicion, and not to a Prince. And therefore, no doubt it were
more meet for a Civil Citezen, or a modeste Maiden, much more, any
honorable person, too bend their ears unto Musicions and syngers, thinkyng
the harkyng unto them more conueniente, (and yet the same to be but for
recreation) then they them selves to be harkened unto by idle and wanton
folk. I wish our Maiden, not only to learn all manner of Nedle work, meet
for a Maiden: but also all that which belongs to the Distaffe and Spindle,
not thinkyng it unseemly to any of what estate or degree so ever, seeing that)
Augustus Caesar Prince and Monarche of the world, was willing to have his
daughter and Niece, skillful in the same. And which is more to the end, that
she being become a married wife, may know the office and duty of household
Servants, let her note, and look how aptly and cleanly they keep the
Chambers, and other like places, how they dress meats, and without any
disdain or arrogancy, how they lay Leven, and other necessaries meet for a
houswife to know, and let her be present at every thing, that longs to
household affairs, for then will it be thought, that she being a wife, will
approve such a one, as all wives ought to be, that is skillful in all
household business, when in their youth they seem ready too learn all that,
which belongs to a Maiden. Now for so much as some virtues, the which,
being in anoble Dame indeed or one of great estate or calling do seem of
small prays, and yet if they be not in her, do often times cause them to
run intoo great reproache, let them in this manner of living have a care,
having that which is needful, to the maintenance and well ordering of their
lives in estimation, that so accustomed and used they not only seace to
desire, but disdain and abhor all that which may provoke and move them
too Glotonie, and sure it would not be amiss if to detect that vice (as also I
have said in all other and above all in that which is contrary to chasticie)
she learneth by lookyng in this Mirrhor to abhore and disdain all foul and
unseemly vsages even as Pallas did, by seeing in a Crystal Mirrhor or as some
wright a clear ronnyng river how, unseemly her cheeks swelled when she
played upon her wind instrument called a flute, and seeing how evil it was for
one of her calling to have a face so disformed, she violently threw it from her
and brake it upon the ground, renouncyng quite the use of it and all such
like. Moreover I would in no wise have our Maiden a liar, but always if she
offends to confess the offense truly, rather then feign by falcehoode a
virtue, for the confession of sin is occasion of penitence, but the
simulation of virtue, is the alteration of the heart to arrogancy, and which
is most dangerous, as a sickness being manifest is to be cured, and as the
fained health gives no occasion of curyng the malady that is secret, so the
offense being manifest and healed by tonueniente remedies gives occasion of
goodness, but the dissimuled or fained virtue without any remedy applied,
nourished the contrary evil. Also I would wish our modest Maiden to be kept
from the company of many, for always there is more to be feared in agreate
company then in a small, and if any be infected of a great and grievous
disease it is so much the more dangerous and contagious, and if in a multitude
there be any mischief to be avoided, or depraved manners to be amended, they
be always more difficill and hard to be ended then in a small a little
number, for so much as evil increases by the usage of diverse, and therefore
it were good for our Maiden to live if it were possible in the company most
commonly of one only, and yet so to eschew the multitude as not too have
them in horrhor: I would also wish her to be instructed and taught to be
friendly and affable to all, and to hounor them, and to be corteous to them,
always granting to other the highest plases, and that not only to them that
be her equalles but to her inferious, to the end that such seeing her great
courtesy to be commendable, may by example of her virtue have Pride in hate
as a most pernicious evil. Besides I would not have her that will attire her
mind by this Mirrhor, to be a babbler or great talker, but to consider that
always much babbling and speaking is occasion of many faults, not only in
youth, in which more then in other age it behooves to learn but also in those
of ripe years and gravity, which ought to be instructors and teachers of
good demeanors. I therefore wish her diligently to harken to all. But
especially being in the company of grave and wise women, I wish her to be
attentive to hear that which they say, and she not to speak to often, for
as she that speaks often is in danger to fail. So she that hereth much is
in possibility to become more wise and learned, which thing to the end it
may happen to our Maiden, I would wish her to take heed and note that which
is uttered to the prays or dispraies of any, and thereafter to frame her life.
Which thing she may easily discern by the iestures and behauiours of the
hearers, who always with cherefull countenances are accustomed to rejoice at
that which is good, contrary with a sower and sharp look and as it were
with grief they accord to that which is evil and told without respect of
place, time, person, or of such things as they talk of, or of themselves.
In this wise she shall make election and choice of that which she ought to
keep silent setting a law to her self, to do the one and eschew the other,
for she ought to know that the use of the tongue is to be used soberly and
discretly, for to that end nature, that wise work woman ordained the tongue
to be enclosed as with a hedge within two rows of teeth, where contrary
she has leaft our ears open, the one to be ready to hear, and the other
slow to speak, there be many excellent examples to be noted and worthy to
be printed in the memory of every man and woman, out of many ancient works,
but among the rest out of Erasmus his golden book, the which he has leaft
written full of the vices and virtue of the tongue, there be many to be
taken, and therefore having cited the book by name, I doubt not but our
Matrone will cause our Maiden to read it on hope whereof I leave to rehearce
the words in this volume. Touching her apparel that I am willing to teach
and instruct, seeing that the same is one of those things which are named
indifferent and for so much as use only makes it to seem diversely good and
bad. I wish her not to be envious at others, neither she by her pompous attire,
or over rich ornaments, to give other cause to envy her, and her self to be
thought arrogant and ambitious, for it is no less dangerous to be envied,
then it is to be envious. But to be always modestly arraied. Now because it
has bin said before, that she should carefully eschew the company of
acquaintance, especially and before all that of Kitchine Maids, and light
gossepes, I think it good here to counsel her again, to use her in such
sort, as in her countenance and behavior, that it appear not any, to proceed
of a proud or arrogant heart, but let her entermedle in their offices and
affairs, with a modeste gravity, garnished with pleasant and mild humility,
always bearyng in mind, how much the conversation of such tattlers as are
more ready too speak that which they ought not, then too harken to that
which they ought, is greatly to be feared, they being evermore accustomed to
be more busy in the reprouyng others faults, then ready to amend their
own. Besides all this, I would wish our well adorned Maiden to be freendly
and affable, so nere as she can unto all, in yeeldyng honor and reverence to
the good, to obtain their love and good likyng, and not to disdain, or
reiecte the evil, to incur their hate. Also I must give remembrance to
eschew one fault that is dangerous, unseemly, and more peculiar in young age,
then in any other, the which because it covers it self as it were, under the
couerture of a such nere virtue, as is both laudable, and a goodly
ornamente, is difficile of the most part to be avoided, and it consists
only in an unseemly and foolish shamefastness, the which oftentimes
passing under the habit of Custom and Nature, does continue possession in
ripe years, with occasion of great reproof. For truly as too much boldness
(being a thing more conueniente for those that to reprove vice, use the parts
of diverse personages in Comedies and Tragedies, then for a modeste or mild
Maiden) is to be shonned and eschewed, as a fault infamous: So to the
contrary, too much fearfulness or shamefastness where it is needelesse, is a
point of great folly, fitter for babes to use, then such a one as I wish
our Maiden to be, that delights to deck her mind by this Mirrhor,
therefore restrainyng these two extremities, if any commit offense proper to
young age, let the^ be shamefast, only in acknowledging their fault and not
otherwise, and so not being obstinate in deniyng, they shall show great
sign of amendment. And sure there can not be a greater chasticemente, then
the same that such a one shall conceive. Likewise where it behooves her to
show her virtue, she shall be ready but not to bold, and by a sudden
blushyng, which immediately will ouerspread her lilly cheeks with roseat
read, she shall show that she bears in her breaste a reuerente heart, far
separated from infamous and reproachful shame. In such wise I say, she shall
with a cherefull countenance, and a well tempered gravity, castyng her eyes
to the earth, show of her self that which nevertheless, although she knows
it will redounde to her praise and commendation, she would willingly dissemble
and feign not to care for. With this commendable confidence, when it behoues
her through request to recite any Psalm, or other Spiritual song, or godly
sentence, she shall set her self for the to do it with a mild refusal, yet
altogether void of indecent affectyng, which thing the most part of people
can hardly eschew, and yet her prudente Matrone, to the end that our Maiden
maic be still in doubt of this affectyng, shall hold her in suspecte of her
refuse. Of which thing in my judgment, there need no other aduisement then
the same which other have written. Among the Lacedaemonians being otherwise,
men virtuous and of a severe discipline, uncorrupted in all other laudable
Customs. This vice have been noted and marked, and that only in Aristotle
chiefly, who in disdainyng sumptuous apparel, sought ambiciously thereby to
purchase fame and renown of magnanimity, and so in that disdainyng, he showed
himself to be proud and arrogant. Which* thing Plato wittely reproved in
Diogenes, who whiles that by an importunate severity, he did tread under his
feet the Couerlettes that he saw liyng upon Plato his bed, far more
rich and costly then it seemed to him conueniente for a Philosopher, said
that he trod under his feet, the pride and ambition of Plato. But Plato very
readily and with great modesty answered and said, O Diogenes, thou treadest
upon my Pride, with a far more hautie and lofty Pride then mine is. So that
many ofte^tymes by reprouyng glory, do seek it. The which as it ought not
to be desired viciously, so ought it not to be refused with too great an
opinion of virtue. Because that in virtuous works, extremities be always
vicious. They do truly dislike that do truly possess this virtue,
otherwise they are not without affectyng, although at the first show it
seems otherwise. And therefore let our Maiden learn to dislike those things
with judgment which she ought not to like, or if she ought to like, yet at
the least to make little show thereof, and that not with travel but with
amilde and courteous countenance. And having opportunity to do any thing by
which any prays or commendacion is to be won, she shall neither dislike
it, nor like it, more it behooves her, for from thence it will spring that she
making others to believe that she by deniyng that for commendacion, which
others do attribute unto her, she will be thought to deceive and merit
much more. Now as touching Feasts and Pastimes I would not wish our Maiden,
or at least our Matrone to suffer our Maiden in her tender years to frequent
or haunt them, by reason that by the same it happens too many as it happened
to Attalanta, whose near obtained victory was hindered by the glisteryng
show of three golden balls which she stayed to gather up, whiles her
adversary, over ran her and wanne the Garlande, which otherwise she her
self had gained. Hard it is to say how much more efficacy the appearance of
evil deeds, has in the hearts and minds of youth, then the same of laudable
examples showen a far of. And therefore to the end that in so gallant a race
our Maiden may not see any thing to hinder or stay her atchiuing to the
end. Let her leave the haunt of feasts and banketes and company of light
huswiues, and only settle her mind to take recreation and pleasure in walking
the Gardens and pleasant Orchardes at convenient time and dew leisure. But
let see, whether am I gone, trust me the great desire that I have to adorn
and deacke our Maiden, or better to say to ripen such virtues as are
beginning to budde in her, has transported me beyond my mark, much like to
him, that walking by the way, being in deep consideration with him self
touching his urgent affairs, and forgetting him self does often pass the
place that he appointed to go unto. So I at this instaunt see my self strayed
beyond the limittes that I had set to wright of this matter, therefore making
an end, I pray God who only can do much more then any counsel or human
pollecie may imagine, so to guide the minds of all Mothers Matrones and
Maidens, as they may far excel in their lives the order that I have set
down in these leaves, and then no doubt but after this life, they shall in the
life to come have fruition of heavenly felicity.

Ne ca ne la.
A pretty pithie Dialogue between Mercury, and Virtue. Made by T. S.
Mercury. THE Goddess Virtue has prayed me by her Letters, to make my
present repair unto her: whereto I willynly accord, only to understand her
pleasure, that ended, I must make spedie return toward Jupiter.


Virtue. Hail heavenly Mercury, Virtue saluteth thee, and yields most
hearty thanks, in that thou vouchsafest to come unto me, whereby I may be
persuaded that I am not yet forsaken of all the gods.


Mercury. I partly understand your meaning, wherefore be breef good Virtue,
and say thy mind, for I am commanded by Jupiter, not to be long absent from
him.


Virtue. Why is it not lawful then for me, neither may I be permitted to make
my complaints (only to the Ambassador of the gods) to show the extremity
of my calamity and oppression? Who shall I have to be reuengers of my cause
and injuries, if liberty and faculty be denied me, to have access unto
Jupiter, only I say unto thee Mercury, whom I have always accounted of, as
my brother, and as such a one have honored and reverenced thee; Oh I most
miserable! to what place shall I fly? To whom shall I have recourse? Of whom
else, or in what place shall I from henceforth ask succor, help, and
comfort? Truly being so poorly apparelled as I am, and evil entreated
both of gods and men; and in this wise disdained and abandoned, even almost
to my being cherished, or imbrased of none, it were far better for me to be
a block, then a goddess.


Mercury. Well Virtue, declare breefly thy cause of calamity, whiles I am
attentive and inclined to hear thee.


Virtue. Alas, see thou not how naked I am, miserably cast down, and well
nere honored, or esteemed of none? Which evil hap and inconvenience is
happened unto me, by the Boldness, Impiety, and Injury wrought against me by
the proud, and arrogante goddess Fortune, I will tell thee Mercury, as I was
extolled and lifted up in great honor and reputation in the Elizian feeldes
among the excellent, modest, and famous personages Socrates, Plato, Demostenes,
Cicero, Archimedes, Policles and many other such like spirits divine, the
which during their life time did above all things, religiously love and
honor me, and as also in those places so pleasant and delectable, many
famous, valiaunte, and triumphaunte Kings, Princes, and worthies of sonderie
Countries, by multitudes come runnyng to embrace me, and yield me all kind of
honor and deutifull salutation, behold there came toward me in great
haste, that impudent and insolent goddess Fortune, my capital and perpetual
enemy, who guarded and encompassed with great companies of armed men, no less
filled with boostyng bragges, and swollen with Pride, then ready to burste with
grief, envy, and dispight (to see me so honored) aduaunsed her self to
displace me, criyng a far of most arrogantly and furiously in this manner:
Why how now Mistress many better, Lady of little, and Regente of right
naught, is there no reverence to be showen, neither know you so much your
manners, as to give place too your betters? To speak a truth, I nothing moved
in deed at her coming, neither did I, or any of my company pass for her,
wherefore she proceaded forth, and proudely said, why gentlewoman will you
not stir? Is this the humility you show to the high presence of gods? Is
this the reverence and honor thou yeeldest unto the^, thou presumptuous
Callott that thou art? Credit me Mercury, I was greatly grieved with so
undeserved an Injury, wherefore some what moved in mind, I thus answered;
why proud goddess, it is not all thy lofty words, neither the power thou
boostest of, that can make me either an abject, or naught worth. Besides I am
not minded (how be it that we are bound to bow to our superiors) to bow or
bend unto thee, least I should run thereby into dishonor and infamy.

This short and sharp answer so vexed Fortune, that furiously inflamed
(without other occasion given) she forthwith step ped forward, and as one
enraged ran violently upon me, breathyng against me, a thousand* sunderie
injuries and spightfull reprooffes, which I here pass over, with the
contumelious and shawefull words, that she vomited out at her first coming,
to the prejudice of mine honor. Wherefore, Plato being moved by her
insolency, began contrary to the yearthly goddesses fancy to dispute, and
allege many things intreatyng of the duty of superious, what they ought to
be in their vocations, and administrations. But she impaciente at such
demonstration, to break of his talk, suddenly said with a loud voice: Oh a
void, a void from before my face and presence this bold prattler, for it is
not appertinent for servants, to entermeddle with the estate of superiors.
Cicero also grieved at the wrong done unto me, began to minister many
examples, tendyng to the perfection of Kings, Princes, and Magistrates, how
they ought to administrate Justice, help the poor people, and in all things
show them selves mainteiners of honor and virtue. But (alas) at the same time
also out of a company of armed men Mark Anthony stepped forth, armed to the
advantage, and with a crewell stroke of his Gantlet hurt Cicero in the face.
Which seeing all my friends being astonished fearing a farther evil saved them
selves by flight, because being unarmed they supposed them selves to weak to
withstand so great a number armed and weaponed, and which were exercised
warrelike in spoils, rapes, and murders. I being then miserably forsaken and
leaft of all my friends, those unkind and cruel warriors took me and tore
of my garments piteously, and finally having cast me into a River hard by
all bemird with mudde, they with great joy, triumphing for such victory,
over me went their ways singyng, showtyng, and daunsyng. Whereof to certify
Jupiter and declare unto him every thing as it passed, as soon as I had leisure
I came hither. It is now a Month and more since that I have every day stayed
to be let in at the gate, praiyng the residewe of Gods at their coming forth
and going in, to be mine aiders. But alas they ever more fed me with excuses.
For either they say they are busied about the making of Cowcombers, and
Gourdes to spring in their time and season, or else to painte and give gallant
gaie wings to Bees and Butterflies. Alas what should I say will they always
be busied about such nedelesse business? and never epsy time and leisure to
prefer my suit? But shall I ever remain shut out from among them, like one
disdayned and contempned? Helas it is long since gardeners took care and
charge over Cowcombers, fearing least by default of wateryng they would wether
and dry up, and yet not withstanding no one of the Gods, or men, have any
care or remembrance of me and mine affairs: Wherefore dear Mercury again,
I most hartelie Pray, entreat, and beseech thee (being trouchman and herault
to the Gods, to take this my just and pitiefull cause in charge I come to thee
for refuge, and humbly unto thee I complain as to him in whom my trust and
hope is, beseching that thou will take such order, that whiles I am
uncharitably forsaken and separated from the Gods. I be not also had in
derision and ignomie among men, for if I should it would be a great
dishonor, shame, and slander to them, to see me who ought to be a chief
among them, so little regarded and smallie accounted of.


Mercury. Helas Virtue I have hard of all thy inconvenience but so it is,
that I can no ways yield thee remedy, for which I am heartily sorry
considering the ancient and near amytie between us, for hereof I advertise
thee, thou have taken in hand to hard and dificile a thing to prevail against
Fortune, seeing that Jupiter him self (seasing to speak of the other Gods) how
be it that he knows him self greatly bound unto thee for many received
benyfittes, yet has he not Fortune only in more honnour and reverence then
thee, but he also fears her force and puissance. For it is she that helped the
Gods to mount up to the heavens, and when it pleases her by her force, she
again can cast them down, therefore dear Virtue if thou be wise and wilt be
ruled by good counsel, withdraw thy self from hence, and go keep company

self for ever as one disdained and rejected of all.


Mercury. Virtue Adieu.
