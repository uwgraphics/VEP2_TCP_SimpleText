The prophet Jonas / with an introduccio^ before teachinge to understood him
and the right use also of all the scripture / and why it was written / and what
is therein to be sought / and shewenge wherewith the scripture is locked up
that he which reads it / can not understood it / though he study therein
never so much: and again with what keys it is so opened / that the reader can
be stopped out with no sotilte or false doctrine of man / from the true sense
and understanding thereof.

W. T. un to the Christen reader.
AS ye e^vious Philistenes stopped ye wesses of Abraham and filled them up
with earth / t^ put ye memorial out of mi^de / to ye intent yt they might
challenge y^ ground: even so the fleshly mi^ded ypocrites stop up the veins
of life which are in y^ scripture / with the earth of their traditions / false
similitudes and lienge allegories: and y^ of like zele / to make y^ scripture
their own possession and marchaundice: and so shutt up the kingdom of heven
which is Gods word nether enteri^ge in the^ selves nor soferinge them that
would.

The scripture has a body with out / and within a soul / sprite and life. It
has with out a bark / a shell and as it were an hard bone for y^ fleshly minded
to gnaw upon. And within it has pith / cornell / mary and all swetnesse for
Gods elect which he has chosen to geve them his spirit / and to write his
law and y^ faith of his son in their hertes.

The scripture co^teyneth. iij. things in it first y^ law to condemn all
flesh: seco^daryly y^ Gospel / yt is to say / promises of mercy for all yt
repent and knowledge their sins at the preachi^ge of ye law and consent in
their hertes that the law is good / and submit themselves to be scolers to
lern to keep the law and to learn to believe y^ mercy that is promised the^:
and thridly the stories and lives of those scolars / both what chances
fortuned the^ / and also by what means their scolemaster taught the^ and made
them perfect / and how he tried the true from the false.

When ye ypocrites come to y^ law / they put gloses to and make no moare of it
then of a worldly law which is satisfied with y^ outward work and which a
turk may also fulfill. When yet Gods law never cease to condemn a man
until it be written in his heart and until he keep it naturally without
co^pulsion and all other respect save only of pure love to God and his
neyboure / as he naturally eats when he is an hongred / without co^pulsio^
and all other respect / save to slake his hongre only.

And when they come to the Gospel / there they mi^gle their leven and say /
God now receaueth us no moare to mercy / but of mercy receaueth us to
penance / that is to wete / holy deeds yt make them fatt belies and us their
captives / both in soul and body. And yet they feign their Idol y^ Pope so
merciful / yt if thou make a little money glister in his Balams eyes / there is
nether penance ner purgatory ner any fasti^ge at all but to fle to heven as
sweste as a thought and at the twinkellynge of an eye.

And the lives stories and gestes of men which are contained in the bible /
they read as things no moare perteyni^ge un to the^ / then a take of Robi^
hode / and as things they wott not whereto they ferue / save to feign false
disca^t and tuglinge allegories / to stablish their kingdom with all. And one
y^ chefest and fleshliest study they have / is to magnify y^ saints above
measure and above y^ truth and with their poetry to make them greater then
ever God make them. And if they fix de any infirmite or sin asscribed un to
y^ saints / that they excuse with all diligence / diminushi^ge the glory of
ye mercy of God and robbinge wretched sinners of all their co^ fo: te / and
think thereby to flater the saints and to obtain their favor and to make
special advocates of the^: even as a man would obtain y^ favor of wordely
tirantes: as they also feign the saints much moare cruel then ever was any
heathen man and moare wrekefull and vengeable then y^ poets feign their gods
or their furies yt torment y^ souls in hell / if their eue^s be not fasted and
their images vifited and saluted with a Pater noster (which prayer only our
lips be accoynted with our hertes vndersto^dinge none at all) and worsheped
with a candell and y^ offeri^ge of our deuocio^ / in y^ place which they have
chosen to hear y^ supplicacio^s and meke peticio^s of their clientes therein.

But thou reader think of ye law of God how yt it is all together spiritual /
and so spiritual yt it is never fulfilled with deeds or works / until they
flow out of thine heart with as great love toward thy neyboure / for no
delerui^ge of his ye though he be thine enemy / as Christ loved y^ and did for
the / for no deserti^ge of thine / but eve^ when thou wast his enemy. And in
ye mean time / thoroute all our infancy and childhod in Christ / till we ^e
grown up in to perfect men in the full knowledge of christ and full love of
christ again and of our neyboures for his sake / after y^ ensample of his
love to us / remenbir that y^ fulfillynge of y^ law is / a fastfayth in
christ's blood coupled with our profession and submytti^ge ourselves to learn to
do better And of y^ Gospel or promises which thou metest in y^ scripture /
believe fast y^ God will fulfill them un to y^ / and that un to y^ vttemost ^ott
/ at the repentance of thine heart / when thou turnest to him and forsakest
evil / even of his goodness and fatherly mertie un to the / and not for thy
flatterlge him with ypocritish works of thine own fayninge. So yt a fast
faith only with out respect of all works / is the forgiveness both of the
sin which we did in time of ignorance with lust and consent to sin / and
also of all the sin which we do by chance and of frailte / after yt we are
come to knowledge and have professed y^ law out of our hertes. And all deeds
serve only for to help our neyboures and to tame our flesh that we fall not
to sin again / and to exercice our souls in virtue / and not to make
satisfaction to God ward for ye sin yt is once paste.

And all other stories of ye bible / with out excepcio^ / are y^ practisinge of
ye law and of the Gospel / and are true and faitfull ensamples and sure
erneste yt God will even so deal with us / as he did with the^ / in all
infirmities / in all temptacio^s / and in all like cases and chances. Wherein
ye se on ye one side / how fatherly and tendirly and with all compassion god
entreats his elect which submit them selves as scolers / to learn to walk
in the ways of his laws / and to keep the^ of love. If they forgatt the^
selves at a time and went astraye / he sought the^ out and fett the^ again
with all mercy. If they fell and hurt the^ selves / he healed the^ again
with all compassion and tenderness of heart. He has often brought great
tribulation and aduersite upon his elect: but all of fatherly love only to
teach the^ and to make them se their own hertes and ye sin yt there lay hid
/ that they might aftirwarde feale his mercy. For his mercy waited upon the^
/ to rid them out again / as soon as they ware learned and come to y^ knowledge
of their own hertes: so that he never cast man away how deep so ever he had
sinned / save the^ only which had first cast y^ yocke of his laws from their
necks / with utter diffiaunce and malice of heart. Which ensamples how
comfortable are they for us / when webe fallen in to sin and God is come
upon us with a storge / y^ we dispeare not / but repent with full hope of
mercy after y^ ensamples of mercy yt are gone before? And therefore they were
written for our lerni^ge / as testifies Paul To. xv. to comfort us / y^ we
might y^ better put our hope and trust in God / when we se / how merciful he
has been in times past un to our weak brethern y^ are gone before / in all
their adversities / neade / temptacio^s / ye and horrible sins in to which
they now and then fell.

And on y^ other side ye se how they y^ hardened their hertes and sinned of
malice and refused mercy y^ was offered the^ and had no power to repent /
perished at y^ later end with all confusion and shame mercilessely. Which
ensamples are very good and necessary / to keep us in awe and dread in time of
prosperity as thou may se by Paul. j. Cor. x. that we abide in the fear of
God / and way not wild and fall to vanities and so sin and provoke God and
bring wrath upon us.

And thridly ye se in that practice / how as god is merciful and
longesoferynge / even so were all his true prophets and prechers / beringe the
infirmities of their weak brethern and their own wro^ges and injuries with
all patience and longesoferinge / never castinge any of the^ of their backs /
un till they sinned agenst y^ holygost / maliciously persecutinge y^ open and
manifest trouch: contrary unto the ensample of y^ Pope / which in sinninge
agenst God and to quench y^ truth of his holy spirit / is ever chief captain
and tro^petblower / to set other awerke / and seeks only his own fredome /
liberte / privilege / wealth / prosperity / profit / pleasure / pastyme /
honor and glory / with y^ bondage / thraldom / captivity / misery /
wretchedness and vile subjection of his brethern: and in his own cause is so
fervent / so steffe and cruel / that he will not sofre one word spoken agenst
his false magiste / wily inuencio^s and iuglynge ypocrisie to be vnadue^ged /
though all christendom should be set to gether by the cares / and should cost
he cared not how many hundred thousand their lives.

Ow y^ thou may read Jonas fruit fully and not as a poetis fable / but as an
obligaco^ between God and thy soul / as an ernist penny given y^ of God / yt he
will help y^ in time of need / if thou turn to him and as the word of god y^
only fode and life of thy soul / this mark and note. First count Jonas the
friend of god and a man chosen of god to testify his name unto y^ world: but
yet a young scolar / weak and rude / after y^ facio^ of y^ appostles / while
Christ was yet with them bodyly. Which though Christ taught the^ ever to be
meke and to vmble the^ selves / yet often strove among them selves who should be
greatest. The sons of Zebede would sit / the one on the right ho^de of Christ
and the other on y^ lift. They would pray / that fire might desce^de from
heaven / and consume the Samaritanes.

When Christ axed who say men that I am / Peter answered / thou art the son
of the lyuinge God / as though Peter had been as perfect as an angel. But
immediately after / when Christ preached unto the^ of his deeth and passion /
Peter was anger and rebuked Christ and thought ernestly yt he had raued and
not wist what he said: as at another time / when Christ was so ferue^tly
busied in healinge y^ people / yt he had no leyser to eat / they went out to
hold him / supposinge that he had been beside him self. Ande one yt cast out
deuels in Christ's name / they forbade / because he waited not on them / so
glorious were they yet.

And though christ taught all way to forgive / yet peter after long goenge
to scole / axed wether men should forgive. vij. times / thynkinge yt. viij.
times had been to much. And at y^ last soper Peter would have died with christ
/ but yet within few hours after / he denied him / both cowardly and
shamefully. And after y^ same manner / though he had so long herd that noma^
might avenge him self / but rather turn y^ other cheke to / then to sinyte
again / yet when Christ was in taki^ge / peter axed whether it were lawful to
smite with y^ sword / and tarried none answer / but laid on rashly. So that
though when we come first unto y^ knowledge of the truth / and the peace is
made between God and us / and we love his laws and believe and trust in him /
as in our father and have good hertes unto him and be born anew in y^ sprite:
yet we are but childern and young scolars weak and foble and must have leysar
to grow in y^ spirit / in knowledge / love and in y^ deeds thereof / as young
childern must have time to grow in their bodies.

And God our father and seolemaster fedeth us and teached us according unto
the capacite of our stomakes / and makes us to grow and wax perfect / and
fineth us and tries us as gold / in y^ fire of temptacio^s and tribulations.
As Moses wittneseth Deutero. viij. saye^ge: Remember all y^ way by which y^
lord thy God carried y^ this. xl. years in y^ wilderness / to vmble the and to
te^pte or prove the / y^ it might be known what were in thine heart. He brougt
the in to aduersite and made y^ an hongred / and then feed y^ with man which
nether thou ner yet thy fathers ever knew of / to teach y^ that a man lives no
thy bred only / but by all that proceadeth out of the mouth of God. For y^
promises of god are life unto all y^ cleave unto the^ / much moare the^ is bred
and bodyly sustinaunce: a^ y^ journey of y^ children of Israel out of egypt in
to y^ land promised them / ministers the notable ensamples and yt abounda^tly
/ a^ does all y^ rest of the bible also. How be it / it is impossible for
flesh to believe and to trust in y^ truth of gods promises / until he have
learned it in much tribulacion / after that God has delivered hi^ out thereof
again.

God therefore to teach Jonas and to show him his own heart and to make him
perfect and to enstructe us also by his ensample / sen^ him out of y^ land of
Israel where he was a prophet / to goo among y^ heathen people and to y^
greatest and mightiest city of y^ world the^ / called Niniue: to preach yt
within. xl. days they should all perish for their sins and that y^ city
should be overthrown. Which message y^ frewil of Jonas had as much power to do
/ as the weakest herted woma^in the world has power / if she were co^maun ded
/ to leppe in to a tobbe of lyuinge snakes and edders: as happily if God had
commanded Sara to have sacrificed her son Isaac / as he did Abraham / she
would have disputed with hi^ yer she had done it / or though she were siro^ge
enough / yet many an holy seint coud not have sound in their hertes / but would
have disobeyed and have run away from y^ presens of yt commandment of god
with Jonas if they had been so siro^gly tempted.

For Jonas thought of this manner: loo / I am here a prophet unto Gods people
the Israelites. Which though they have gods word testified unto them daily /
yet dispite it and worshepe God under y^ likeness of calves and after all
manner facions save after his own word / and therefore are of all nations y^
worst and most worthy of punishment. And yet god for love of few yt are among
them and for his names sake spares them and defer^ death them. How the^ should
god take so cruel vengeance on so great a multitude of them to whom his
name was never preached to and therefore are not y^ tenth part so euel as
these? If I shall therefore goo preach so shall I lie and shame my self and God
the to and make them the moare to dispice god and set the less by him and to
be the moar^ cruel un to his people.

And upon that imaginacio^ he fled from the face or presens of God: that is /
out of y^ contre where God was worsheped in and from prosecutynge of Gods
commandment / and thought / I will get me a another way among y^ hethen
people and be no moare a prophet / but live at rest and out of all co^braunce.
Never y^ less the god of all mercy which cares for his elect childern and
turns al^ un to good to them and smites the^ to heal them again and
kills the^ to make the^ al^ue again / and plays with the^ (as a father
does some time with his you^ge ignorant childern) and tempts them and
proves them to make them se their own hertes / provided for onas / how all
thing should be.

When Jonas was entered in to the sheppe / he laid him down to sleep and to
take his rest: that is / his conscience was tossed between the co^maudeme^t of
God which sent him to Niniue / and his fleshly wisdom that dissuaded and
counseled him ye contrary and at ye last preualed against ye commandment and
carried him a another way / as a sheppe caught between. ij. streams / and as
poets feign the mother of Meliager to be between diverse affeccio^s / while to
adue^ge her brothers deeth / she sought to sle her own son. Where upon for
very pain and tediousness / he lay down to sleep / for to put ye
commandment which so gnew and freate his conscience / out of mind / as y^
nature of all weked is / when they have sinned a good / to seek al means with
riot / revel and pastyme / to drive ye remenbraunce of sin out of their
thoughts or as Ada^ did / to cover their nakedness with aporns of pope holy
works* But God awoke him out of his dream / and set his sins before his
face.

For when y^ Lot had caught Jonas / the^ be sure yt his sins came to
remembrance again and that his conscience raged no less the^ ye waves of the
se. And the^ he thought that he only was a sinner and ye hethen that ware in ye
shepp none in respect of him / ^o thought also / as verily as he was fled from
god / that as verily god had cast hi away* for y^ sight of y^ rod mal eth y^
natural child not only to se and to knowledge his fault / but also to forgett
all his fathers old mercy and kindness. And then he confessed his sin
openly and had yet sever perish alone the^ y^ y^ other should have perished with
him for his sake: and so of very desperacion to have lived any longer / bad
cast him in to y^ see betymes / except they would be lost also.

To speak of lottes / how ferforth they are lawful / is a light question.
First to use the^ for the breakinge of strife / as when partenars / their
goods as equally divided as they ca^ / take every man his part by lot / to
avoyde all suspicio^ of disceytfulnesse: and as y^ appostles in y^ first of y^
Acts / when they sought a another to succeed Judas the traytoure / and. ij.
persons were presents / the^ to break strife and to satisfy al parties /
did cast lott^es / wheter should be admitted / desirynge god to ^eper the^ and
to take who^ he knew most mete / seeing they wist not wheter to prefer / or
happily could not all agree on either / is lawful ad in all like cases. But to
abuse them un to y^ tempiinge of God and to compel him therewith to utter
things whereof we sto^d in doubt / when we have no commandment of him so to
do / as these hethe^ here did / though God turned it un to his glory / can not
be but evil.

The hethen s^epine^ asstonied at y^ sight of y^ miracle / feared God / prayed
to him / offered sacrifice and vowed vows. And I doubt not / but that some of
the^ or happily all came thereby un to the true knowledge and true worshepinge of
God and ware wo^ne to God in their souls. And thus God which is infinite
merciful in all his ways / wrought their souls health out of y^ infirmite of
Jonas / even of his good will and purpose and love wherewith he loved them
before the world was made / and not of chance / as it appears un to the eyes
of the ignorant.

And that Jonas was.iij. days and.iij. nights in the belly of his fish: we ca^
not there by prove un to te Jews and i^fideles or un to any man / y^ Christ
must therefore dye and be buried and rise again. But we use y^ ensample and
likeness to strength the says of the weak. For he that beleaueth the one
cannot doubt in y^ other: in as much as the hand of God was no less mighty in
preseruige Jonas alive agenst all natural possibilite and in deliuerynge hi
safe out of his fish / the^ in reysynge up Christ again out of his sepulcher.
And wemaye describe y^ power and virtue of y^ resurrection thereby / ac Christ
hi^ self boroweth y^ similitud^e thereto Mat. xij. saye^ge un to y^ Jews that
came about him and desired a sign or a wonder from heaven to certifye the^
that he was christ: this evil and wed lockebreaki^ge nacio^ (which break y^
wedlock of faith wherewith they be* married un to God / and believe in their
false works) seek a sign / but there shall no sign be given the^ save ye
sign of the Prophet Jonas. For as Jonas was. iij. days and iij. nights in
the belly of the whale / eue^ so shall the son of man be. iij. days and. iij.
nyghtes in the heart of the earth. Which was a watch word / as we say / and a
sharp threateninge un to y^ Jews and as much to say as thus / ye hard
herted Jews seek a sign: loo / this shall be your sign / as Jonas was raised
out of the sepulcher of his fish and then sent un to the Ninevites to preach
y^ they should perish / even so shall I rise again out of my sepulcher and come
and preach repentance un to you. Se therefore when ye se y^ sign that ye
repent or else ye sha^ suerly perish and not escape. For though the infirmities
which ye now se i my flesh be a let un to your faythes / ye shall yet then be
with out excuse / when ye se so great a miracle and so great power of god
shed out upon you. And so Christ came again after y^ resurrection / in his
spirit and preached repentance un to them / by the mouth of his appostles and
disciples / and with miracles of y^ holy ghost. And all that repented not
perished shortly after and were for y^ most part slain with sword and y^
rest carried away captive in to all quarters of the world for an ensample / as
ye se un to this day.

And in like manner sens the world began / where soever repentance was
offered and not received / there God took cruel vengeance immiediatly: as ye
se in y^ ^loud of No^ / in the ouerthrowe^ge of Sodo^ and Gomor and all the
contre about: and as ye se of Egipte / of the Amorites / Cananites and
afterward of the very Israelites / and then at the last of the Jews to / and
of the Assyriens and Babysoniens and so thorout all the imperes of the world.

Gyldas preached repentance un to y^ o^ de Britaynes that inhabited england:
they repented not / and therefore God sent in their enemies upon the^ on every
side and destroyed the^ up and gave the lo^d un to other nations And great
vengeance has been taken in that land for sin sens that time.

Wicleffe preached repentance un to our fathers not long sens: they repented
not for their hertes were indurat and their eyes blinded with their own Pope
holy rightwesnesse wherewith they had made their souls gaye agenst the
receauinge agayn^ of y^ woked spirit that brings. vij. worse then him self
with him and makes y^ late ^ end worse then the beginning: for in open
sins there is hope of repentance / but in holy ypocrisie none at all. But
what followed? they slew their true and right king and set up* iij. wrong
kings arow / under which all the noble blood was slain up and half the
conie^s thereto / what in france and what with their own sword / in fighti^ge
among the^ selves for y^ crown / and y^ cities and towns decayed and the
land brought half in to a wilderness in respect of that it was before.

And now Christ to preach repentance / is resen yet o^ce again out of his
sepulcher in which the pope had buried him and kept him down with his pilars
and polaxes and all disgysinges of ypocrisie / with gyle / wifes and falshed /
and with the swerd of al princes which he had blinded with his false
marchaundice. And as I dowte not of y^ ensamples that are past / so am I sure
that great wrath will follow / except repentance turn it Back again and
cease it.

When Jonas had been in te fishes belly a space and the rage of his conscience
was somewhat quieted and swaged and he come to him self again and had
received a little hope / the qualmes and panges of desperacio^ which went over
his heart / half overcome he prayed / as he makes mencio^in the text saye^ge:
Jonas prayed un to the lord his god out of the belly of the fish. But the
words of that prayer are not here set. The prayer y^ here stand th in the
text / is the prayer of praise and tha^kesgeue^ge which he prayed and wrote
when he was escaped and past all ieopardie.

In the end of which prayer he says / I will sacrifice with the voice of
thankesgeuenge and pay that I have vowed / that sauinge comes of the lord.
For verily to confess out of the heart / that all benefits come of God / even
out of the goodness of his mercy and not deserving of our deeds / is the
only sacrifice that pleases God. And to believe that god only is the sauer / is
the thing that all the Jews vowed in their circumcision / as we in our
baptim. Which vow Jonas now tawght with experience / promises to pay. For
those outward sacrifices of bestes / un to which Jonas had happily asscribed to
much before / were but feeble and childish things and not ordained / that the
works of the^ selves should be a service unto god / but un to the people / to
put the^ in remembrance of this inward sacrifice of thanks and of faith to
trust and believe in God the only sauer. Which significacion when was away /
they were abominable and deuellysh ydolatrye and imageseruice: as our
ceremonies and sacraments are become now to all that trust and believe in the
work of them and are not taught the significacions / to edifye their souls
with knowledge and the doctrine of God.

When Jonas was cast upon land again / then his will was fre and had power to
goo whother God sent him and to do what God bade / his own imaginacions laid
a part. For he had been at a new scole / ye and in a furnace where he was
purged of much refuse and droshe of fleshly wisdom / which resisted y^ wisdom
of god and led Jonases will contrary un to y^ will of god. For as far as we be
blind in Adam / we can not but seek and will our own profitt / pleasure and
glory. And as far as we be taught in the sprite / we can not but seek and
will the pleasure and glory of God only.

And as for the. iij. days journey of Niniue / whether it were in length or to
goo round about it or through all the streets / I commit un to the
discrecio^ of other men. But I think that it was then the greatest city of
the world.

And that Jonas went a days journey in the city / I suppose he did it not in
one day: but went fair and easyly preachi^ge here a sermon and there a another
and rebuked the sin of the people for which they must perish.

And when thou art come un to the repentance of the Ninevites / there have
thou sure ernest / that how soever anger god be / yet he remembers mercy un
to all that truly repent and believe in mercy. Which ensample our savior
Christ also casts in the teeth of the indurat Jews saying: the Ninevites
shall rise in judgment with this nation and condemn them / for they repented
at the preaching of Jonas / and behold a greater the^ Jonas here / meaning
of him self. At whose preachinge yet / though it were never so mighty to
perce the heart / and for all his miracles thereto / the hard herted Jews could
not repent: when the heathen Ninevites repented at the bare preaching of Jonas
rebukinge their sins with out any miracle at all.

Why? For y^ Jews had leue^ded the spiritual law of God and with their gloses
had made it all to gether erthie and fleshly / and so had set a veil or
coueringe on Moses face / to shodowe and darken y^ glorious brightness of his
contenaunce. It was sin to stele: but to rob wedowes howses under a color
of long praye^ge / and to polle in the name of offeringes / and to snare y^
people with intolerable co^stitucions against all love / to ketch their money
out of their purses / was no sin at all.

To smite father and mother was synn: But to withdraw help from them at their
need / for blind zele of offeringe / un to the profytt of the holy phareses /
was then as meritorious as it is now to let all thy kynne chose wheter they
will synke or sweme / while thou byldest and make goodly fundacio^s for holy
people which thou have chosen to be thy christ / for to sowple thy soul with
the oil of their sweet blessings / and to be thy Jesus for to save thy soul
from y^ purgatory of the blood that only purges sin / with their watchi^ge /
fasti^ge / wolward goinge and rysynge at mydnyght etc. where with yet they
purge not them selves from their covetousness / pride / lechury or any vice
that thou seyst among the lay people.

It was great sin for Christ to heal the people on the sabbath day un to
the glory of God his father / but none at all for them to help their catell
unto their own profett.

It was sin to eat with unwashed hands or on an unwashed table / or out of
an unwashed dish: but to eat out of that purifyed dysh that which came of
brybery / theft and extorsion / was no sin at all.

It was exceadynge meritorious to make many dyscyples: But to teach them to
fear God in his ordynaunces / had they no care at all.

The hye prelates so defended the right of holy church and so feared the people
with the curse of God and terreble pains of hell / that no man durst leave the
vilest herke in his gardeyne vntythed. And the offering and things dedycat un
to God for the profitt of his holy vycars where in soch estymacion and
reverence / that it was much greater sin to swear truly by them / the^ to
for swear thy self by God: what vengeance then of God / and how terreble and
cruel damnacion think ye preached they to fall on the^ that had stolen soch
holy things? And yet says Christ / that ryghtwesnesse and faith in keeping
promise / mercy and indyfferent judgment were vtturly trodden under foot and
clean dispysed of those blessed fathers / which so mightily mayntened Arons
patrimony and had mad it so prosperous and environed it and walled it about on
every side with y^ fear of god / that noman durst twech it.

It was great holiness to garnysh y^ se pulchres of y^ prophets and to
condemn their own fathers for sleynge of them: and yet were they the^ selves
for blind zele of their own co^stitucio^s / as ready as their fathers to sle
whosoever testified un to them / the same truth which the prophets testified
un to their fathers. So that Christ co^pareth all the rightwesnesse of those
holy patriarchs un to the out ward bewtye of a painted sepulcher full of
stench and all uncleanness wythyn.

And finally to begyld a man's neyboure in sotle bargeninge and to wrappe and
co^pase him in with cauteles of the law / was then as it is now in the kingdom
of y^ Pope. By the reason where of they excluded the law of love out of their
hertes / and co^se que^tly all true repentance: for how could they repent of
y^ they could not se to be sin?

And on the other side they had set up a rightwesnesse of holy works / to
cleanse their souls with all: as the Pope sanctifies us with holy oil / holy
bred / holy salt / holy candels / holy dome ceremonies and holy dome blessings
/ and with what soever holiness thou will save with the holiness of* Gods word
which only speaks un to the heart and shows the soul her fi^thyne^se and
uncleanness of sin / and leads her by y^ way of repentance un to y^
fountain of Christ's blood to wash it away through faith. By the reason of
which false rightwesnesse they were dysobedient un to the rightwesnesse of God
/ which is the forgiveness of sin in Christ's blood and could not believe
it. And so through fleshly interpretynge the law and false imagined
rightwesnesse / their hertes were hardened and made as stony as clay in an hot
surnace of fire / that they could receive nether repentance ner faith or any
moyster of grace at all.

But the hethen Ninevites / though they were blinded with lusts a good / yet
were in those. ij. points incorrupt and vnhardened / and therefore with the
only preachinge of Jonas came un to the knowledge of their sins and confessed
them and repented truly and turned every man from his euelldedes and declared
their sorrow of heart and true repentance / with their deeds which they did out
of faith and hope of forgiveness / chastysinge their bodies with prayer and
fasting and with taking all pleasures from the flesh: trusting / as god was
anger for their were kednesse / even so should he forgive them o^ his mercy / if
they repented and forsook their mysse fyuinge.

And in the last end of all / thou have yet a goodly ensample of learning / to
se how earth ye Jonas is still for all his tryenge in the whales belly. He was so
sore displeased because the Ninevites perished not / that he was weary of his
life and wished after the deeth for very sorrow and pain / that he had loost
the glory of his prophesienge / in that his prophecy come not to pass. But
god rebuked him with a likeness saying: it greueth thine heart for the loss
of a vile shrob be or spraye / whereon thou bestoweddest no loboure or cost /
nether was it thine handwerke. How much moare then should grieve mine heart / the
loss of so great a multitude of innoce^tes as are in Niniue / which are all
mine hands work. Nay Jonas / Jam God over all / and father as well un to the
hethen as un to the Jews and merciful to all and warn yer I smite: nether
threte I so cruelly by any prophet / but that I will forgive if they repent
and ax mercy: nether on the other side / what soever I promise / will I
fulfill it / save for their sakes only which trust in me and submit them
selves to keep my laws of very love / as natural chyldern.

ON this manner to read y^ scripture is y^ right use thereof and why y^ holy ghost
caused it to be written. That is yt thou first seek out y^ law / what god will
have the to do / interpretinge it spiritually with cut gloss or coueringe the
brightness of Moses face / so yt thou feel in thine heart / how that it is
damnable sin before god / not to love they neyboure that is thine enemy / as
puerly as Christ loved the / and y^ not to love thy neyboure in thine heart /
is to have committed all ready all sin agenst him. And therefore un till that
love become / thou must knowledge unfeignedly that there is sin in the best
deed thou do. And it must ernestly grieve thine heart and thou must wash all
thy good deeds in christ's blood / yet they can be pure and an acceptable
sacrifice un to God / and must desire god y^ father for his sake / to take thy
deeds a worth and to pardon y^ imperfectenesse of them / and to give the power
to do the^ better and with moare fervent love.

And on the other side thou must search diligently for the promises of mercy
which God has promised the again. Which. ij. points / that is to wete / y^
law spiritually interpreted / how that all is damnable sin that is not
unfeigned love out of the grownde and botom of the heart after the ensample of
Christ's love to us / because we be all equally created and formed of one god
our father / and indifferently bought and redeemed with one blood of our
savior Jesus Christ: and that the promises be given un to a repenting soul
that thursteth and longs after them / of the pure and fatherly mercy of god
through our faith only with out al deserving of our deeds or merits of
our works / but for Christ's sake alone and for the merits and deseruinges
of his works / death and passions that he sofered all together for us and not
for himself: which. ij. points I say / if they be written in thine heart /
are the keys which so open all the scripture un to the / that no creature can
lock the out / and with which thou shall goo in and out / and find pasture
and fode every where. And if these lesons be not writtten in thine heart / then
is all the scripture shutt up / as a cornell in the shale / so that thou may
read it and comen of it and rehearse all the stories of it and dispute sotilly
and be a profounde sophister / and yet understand not one Jot thereof.

And thridly that thou take the stories and lives which are contained in the
bible / for sure and undoubted ensamples / yt God so will deal with us un to
the worlds end.

Here with Reader farewell and be commended un to God / and un to the grace of
his spryte. And first se that thou stop not thine ears un to the calling of
god / and that thou harden not thine heart begyled with fleshly interpretinge
of the law and false imagined and ypocritish rightwesnesse / and so the
Ninevites rise with the at ye day of judgment and condemn the.

And seco^darily if thou find ought amiss / when thou seyst thy self in the
glass of Gods word / think it co^pendious wisdom / to amend y^ same
betymes / moneshed and warned by the ensample of other men / rather the^ to
tarry until thou be beten also.

And thridly if it shall so chance / that y^ wild lusts of thy flesh shall
blind the and carry the clean away with them for a time: yet at the later
end / when y^ god of all mercy shall have compased the in on every side with
te^ptacio^s / tribulacions / adversities and co^braunce / to bring y^ home
again un to thine own heart / and to set thy sins which thou would so
feign cover and put out of mind with delectacio^ of voluptuous pastymes /
before y^ eyes of thy conscience: then call y^ faithful ensample of Jonas and
all lylie stories un to thy remembrance / and with Jonas turn un to thy
father that smote y^: not to cast y^ away / but to lay a corosie and a
^eeatige playlier un to y^ pocke that lay ^^o and fret inward / to draw y^
disease out and so make it appear / y^ thou might feale t^y seckenes and y^
danger thereof and come and re leave the healynge plaster of mercy.

And forget not yt what soever ensample of mercy god has showed sens y^
beginning of y^ world / the same is promised the / if thou will in like manner
turn again and received it as they did. And with Jonas be a known of thy
sin and confess it and knowledge it un to thy father.

And as y^ law which freteth thy conscience / is in thine heart and is none
outward thige / eve^ so seek within in thine heart / ye plaster of mercy /
the promyses of forgiveness in our savior Jesus Christ / according un to
all the ensamples of mercy that are gonne before.

And with Jonas let the^ that wait on vanities and seek god here and there and
in every temple save in their hertes goo / and seek thou y^ testament of god in
thine heart. For in thine heart is the word of y^ law / and in thine heart is y^
word of faith in the promises of mercy in Jesus Christ. So that if thou
confess with a repenting heart and knowledge and surely believe yt Jesus is
lord over all sin / thou art saffe.

And finally when the rage of thy co^sci^^ce ^^ ceased and quieted with fast
faith in the promises of mercy / then offer with Jonas the offeringe of praise
and thankesgeuinge / and pay the vow of thy baptim / that God only saves / of
his only mercy and goodness: that is / believe steadfastly and preach
constantly that it is God only that smyteth / and God only that heals:
ascribynge y^ cause of thy tribulation un to thine own sin / and y^ cause of
thy deliverance un to the mercy of God.

And beware of the leue^ y^ says we have power in our frewill before y^
preachinge of y^ Gospel / to deserve grace / to keep y^ law / of co^gruite /
or god to be vnrightwesse. And f^ie with Jhon in the first / yt as y^ law was
given by Moses / eue^ so grace to fulfill it / is given by christ. And when
they say our deeds with grace deserve heaven / sa^e thou with Paul To. vj. y^
euerlasti^ge life is the gift of god through Jesus Christ our lord / and yt
we be neade sons by faith Jhon. j. and therefore heirs of god with christ To.
viij. And says that we receive al of god through faith that follows repentance
/ and yt we do not our works un to god / but either un to oureselues / to
fley y^ sin that remains in y^ flesh and to wax perfect / either un to
our neyboures which do as much for us again in some other things. And when
a man exceadeth in gifts of grace / let hi^ understood that they be given him
/ as well for his weak brethern / as for him self: as though all the bred be
committed un to the panter / yet for his fellows with him / which give the
thanks un to their forde / and recompense the panter again with other kind
service in their offices. And when they say that Christ has made no
satisfaccion for the sin we do after our baptym: say thou with the
doctrine of Paul / that in our baptym we receive the merytes of Christ's
deeth through repentance and faith of which two / baptim is the sign. And
though when we sin of fra^ltie after our baptym we receive the sign no
moare / yet we be renewed again through repentance and faith in Christ's
blood / which twain / the sign of baptym ever continued among us in
baptisynge our young childern does ever keep in mind and call us back
again un to our profession if we be gonne astraye / and promises us
forgiveness. Nether can actual sin be washed away with our works / but
with Christ's blood: nether can there be any other sacrifice or satisfaccion
to Godward for them / save Christ's blood. For as much as we can do no works
unto God / but receive only of his mercy with our repenting faith / through
Jesus Christ our forde and only sauer: un to whom and un to God our father
through him / and un to his holy spirit / that only purges / sanctifies and
washes us in the innocent blood of our redemption / be praise for ever

AMEN.
The Story of the prophet Jonas.
The first Chapter.
THe word of the lord came un to the prophet Jonas ye son of Amithai
saying: rise and get the to Niniue that great city and preach un to the^ /
how that their wekednesse is come up before me.

And Jonas made hi ready to fle to Tharsis from the presens of y^ lord / and
gatt him down to Joppe / and found there a sheppe ready to goo to Tharsis /
and paid his fare / and went aborde / to goo with them to Tharsis from the
presens of the lord.

But y^ lord hurled a great wind in to y^ se / so that there was a myghtie
tempest in these: in so much yt the shepp was like to goo in pieces. And the
mariners were afraid and cried every man un to his god / and cast out y^
goods yt were in ye sheppe in to y^ se / to lighten it of the^. But Jonas gatt
him under the hatches and laid him down and ^lombrede. And y^ master of the
sheppe came to him and said un to hi^ / why slomberest thou? up / and call un
to thy god / that God may think on us / that we perish not.

And they said one to a another / come and let us cast lottes / to know for
whose cause we are thus troublede. And they cast ^ottes. And y^ lot fell upon
Jonas.

The^ they said unto hi^ / tell us for whose cause we are thus trowbled: what is
thine occupacio^ / whence come thou / how is thy co^tre called / and of what
nation art thou?

And he answered the^ / I am an Ebrue: and the lord God of heaven which made
both se and dry land / I fear. Then were the men exceadingly afraid and said
un to him / why did thou so? For they knew that he was fled from the
presens of the lord / because he had told them.

Then they said un to him / what shall we do unto the / that these mayecease
from trowblinge us? For these wrought and was trowblous. And he answered them /
take me and cast me in to these / and so shall it let you be in rest: for I
wotte / it is for my sake / that this great tempest is come oppon you.
Nevertheless the men assayed with rowenge to bring the sheppe to land: but
it would not be / because these so wrought and was so trowblous agenst them.
Wherefore they cried un to the lord and said: O lord latt us not perih for
this man's deeth / nether lay innocent blood un to our charge: for thou lord
even as thy pleasure was / so thou have done.

And the^ they took Jonas / and cast hi^ in to y^ se / and the se left
ragynge. And ye men feared the lord excedingly: and sacrificed sacrififice un
to the lord: and vowed vows.

The second Chapter.
BUt y^ lord prepared a great fyshe / to swalow up Jonas. And so was Jonas in
ye bowels of ye fish. iij. days and. iij. nights. And Jonas prayed unto y^
lord his god out of y^ bowels of the fish.

And he said: in my tribulacion I called un to the lord / and he answered me:
out of the belly of hell I cried / and thou herdest my voice. For thou hadest
cast me down deep in the mids of the se: and the flood co^pased me about:
and all thy waves and rowles of water went over me: and I thought y^ I had be
ne cast away out of thy sight. But I will yet again look toward thy holy
temple. The water co^pased me eue^ un to the very soul of me: the deep lay
about me: and the wedes were wrappte aboude mine heed. And I went down un to
the botome of the hills / and was barred in with earth on every side for ever.
And yet thou lord my God broughtest up my life again out of corrupcion. When
my soul faynted in me / I thought on the lord: and my prayer came in un to
the / even in to thy holy temple. They yt observe vain vanities / have
forsaken him that was merciful un to them. But I will sacrifice un to the with
the voce of thankesgeuinge / and will pay that I have vowed / that sauinge
comes of the lord.

And the lord spoke un to the fish: and it cast out Jonas again upon ye dry
land.

The. iij. Chapter.
THen came the word of the lord un to Jonas again saying: up / and get ye
to Niniue that great city / and preach un to the^ the preaching which I
bade ye. And he arose and went to Niniue at ye lords co^maundme^t. Niniue was
a great city un to god / co^teyni^ge. iij. days journey

And Jonas went to and entered in to y^ city even a days journey / and cried
saying: There shall not pass. xl. days but Niniue shall be overthrown.

And the people of Niniue be leued God / and proclaimed fasiynge / and arrayed
them selves in sackeloth / as well the great as the small of them.

And y^ tydinges came un to the king of Niniue / which arose out of his sete /
and did his apparel of and put on sackcloth / and sat hi^ down in ashes.
And it was cried and commanded in Niniue by y^ auctorite of y^ king and of
his lords saying: se that nether man or be / ox or sheep taste ought at al
/ and that they nether feed or drink water.

And they put on sackcloth both man and be / and cried un to God mightily /
and turned every man from his weked way / and from doenge wrong in which they
were acustomed / saying: who can tell whether god will turn and repent / and
cease from his fearce wrath / that we perish not? And when god saw their
works / how they turned from their weked ways / he repented on ye evil which
he said he would do un to them / and did it not.

The. iiij. Chapter.
Wherefore Jonas was sore discontent and anger. And he prayed un to the lord
and said: O lord / was not this my saying when I was yet in my contre? And
therefore I hasted rather to fle to Tharsis: for I knew well enough that thou
wast a merciful god / full of compassion / long yer thou be anger and of great
mercy and repentest when thou art come to take punishment. Now therefore take
my life from me / for I had lever dye then live. And the lord said un to Jonas
/ art thou so angry?

And Jonas gate him out of the city and sat him down on the est side
theroffe / and made him there a both and sat thervnder in the shadow / till
he might se what should chance un to the city.

And y^ lord prepared as it were a wild vine which spra^ge up over Jonas /
that he might have shadow over his heed / to deliver him out of his pain. And
Jonas was exceadynge glad of the wild vine.

And the lord ordained a worm agenst the spring of y^ morrow morni^ge which
smote the wild vine / that it wethered away. And as soon as the son was up /
God prepared a fervent cest wind: so that y^ son beat over the heed of
Jonas* that he fainted again and wished un to his soul that he might dye /
and said / it is better for me to dye then to live.

And god said un to Jonas / art thou so anger for thy wildvine? And he said /
I am angry a good / even on to the deeth. And the lord said / thou have
compassion on a wild vine / whereon thou bestoweddest no labor ner made it
grow / which sprange up in one night and perished in another: and should not I
have compassion on Niniue that great city / wherein there is a multitude of
people / even above an hundred thousand that know not their right hand from
the lift / besides much catell?
