NEWS From Bohemia. An Apology Made by the States of the Kingdom of Bohemia,
showing the Reasons why those of the Reformed Religion were moved to take
Arms, for the defense of the King and themselves, especially against the
dangerous Sect of Jesuits.

WITH A plain Declaration, that those who belong unto the Monasteries and
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction (according unto his Majesty's Letters, and
Agreements made between the States of the Reformed Religion and the Papists)
have good right, as being Subjects of the Imperial Majesty, to the peaceable
exercise of their Divine Service, and building of Churches.

News from Bohemia. AN APOLOGY MADE BY THE STATES of Bohemia, in their
Defense against the Jesuits.
WE the Barons, Knights, etc. of Prage, Ruttenbergh, Cutna, and other Cities
of the famous Kingdom of Bohemia, that receive the holy Sacrament of the
Supper of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, under both kinds, and with one
mind and consent hold, and acknowledge the Bohemian Confession; Now at this
present assembled in the Castle of Prage, both in our own names, and also in
the names of those that are absent, send greeting, or make known unto all men:

That whereas, after many injuries and calamities practiced and done, in former
years, by the means and procurements of certain malicious and turbulent
persons, not only Secular, but also in title Spiritual (as they would
pretend) specially that pernicious and most dangerous Sect of Jesuits, in the
Kingdom of Bohemia (whose whole practices, actions, and counsels, tend only
and specially, by crafty and subtle means, not only to bring our Kings
sovereign Majesty, but also the States, and all the common people of the said
Kingdom, that receive the holy Sacrament of the precious Body and Blood of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (sub vtraque) under both kinds, into the yoke
and subjection of foreign power, that is, of the Church of Rome) not only by
the Estates, but also by all others the Inhabitants of the said Kingdom, as
well in Civil as Ecclesiastical causes, sustained and endured. In the years
of our Lord 1609. and 1610. all contentions and controversies were fully
pacifyed and ended; and to that end, by the Letters Patents of Rodulphus; the
late Emperors Majesty of famous Memory, as also by consent of both parts,
that receive the Sacrament as well sub vna, as sub vtraque: that is, under one,
and under both kinds, at a general Assembly or Parliament, then made and
holden, it was firmly agreed upon, and generally confirmed and consented unto:
that neither part should from thence-forth trouble, grieve or molest one the
other; but that as well they that received sub vna, and those that communicated
sub altra, according to the Union made and confirmed between them, should from
thence-forth, peaceably and quietly, at all times, and in all places, without
interruption either of Spiritual or Temporal Authority, freely serve God; as
by the said Letters Patents, Contract, and public Assembly of Parliament
holden, more at large appears. The which also his Imperial Majesty, our
Sovereign King, of his great and Princely clemency, at his entry into the
reign of this his Kingdom, according to the manner and ancient custom of the
Land, not only generally, but specially ratified and confirmed.

Nevertheless, the aforesaid common enemies, as well of the King, and this
Kingdom, as of all peace and quietness, have spared no means, pains, nor
labor, to devise and practice, not only, how, and which way, they might
procure the breach and annihilating of the said most desired and confirmed
Peace; but also to effect their evil, wicked, and pernicious purposes and
intents, secretly practiced against this Kingdom, and the Inhabitants thereof:
And to that end, (when the said Peace and Union was fully ratified and
confirmed) rejecting all other points, not only refused to agree unto the said
Letters Patents, and Peace made; but also utterly denied to subscribe unto the
Amnestia, (whereby we, by the late Emperors Rodulphus, of famous memory,
consent, were fully and wholly reconciled together, and all revenge and evil
will to surcease and be ended) but rather sought by all the means they could
practice and devise, wholly and altogether to dissolve and exterminate the
same; and to many men daily showed their wicked and malicious intent: whereas
before they were not only secret, but in many causes and actions, open enemies
unto this their native Country, going about to bereave and take from our
present Lord and sovereign King, the assignation of this Kingdom, and to
trans-fer the same unto another: But when they could not effect the same, and
their hopes therein were altogether frustrated (for that, by Gods mercy, in his
time appointed, all things by the commandment of the Emperors Majesty, our
sovereign Lord and King, were fully confirmed) they proceeded so far, through
the procurement of the Jesuits, and others their adherents; again by many
slanderous reports, and censures, both by word of mouth, and writing, to
publish and proclaim all those in this Kingdom that receive the Communion
under both Kinds, to be notorious Heretics: with whom, according to a maxim
of their Papisticall doctrine, they are not bound (as they teach) to keep or
hold any faith or promise: giving also diverse other new-fayned, and infamous
names, both unto us, and the doctrine of the Gospel, to the great contempt of
our Religion of receiving under both kinds; and not only that, but also in
their scandalous writings affirm, all those that use the same Religion, as
also, all that are not conformable to the Romish Religion, to be worthy of,
and to have deserved all kind of Infamy and punishment; animating the Secular
Magistrate with fire and sword, to persecute all those that profess the
receiving of the Communion under both kinds.

And the better to deceive the simpler sort of people, and to set division and
enemity between those of the reformed Religion: the said enemies of this
Kingdom, and the common peace thereof, sought to set those whom we, by the
Kings Majesty's Letters Patents, and his Graces special Consent, had made
Protectors and Super-intendents of our Religion, at variance: by that means
not only utterly to withdraw them from their functions, but also wholly to
subvert and overthrow our Religion. For in open Assemblies, when by means of
their wicked and secret conspiracies, they had sowed contention and hatred
among those of our Religion: when the said Union for Religion on our parts was
made, and his Majesty's Letters Patents in Parliament rehearsed, as also a
general confirmation of all our immunities, and privileges of this Kingdom,
confirmed by his sacred Majesty our King now reigning, were in specie related;
(purposely to further their wicked and malicious intents:) they were by them
diversely and contrarily interpreted. Sometime with great promises, and then
again with threatenings of incurring the Emperors Majesty's indignation, they
sought to dissuade and terrify the said Super-intendents from perseuering in
the protection by them undertaken: and by that means made such as in their
profession of Religion were not well grounded and confirmed, to doubt and to
waver; bringing others, by promises and hopes of dignities, to yield to them,
by fearing and doubting to be wholly disgraced and rejected of men, as also not
to lose the benefit of earthly preferment; and so, ere they were aware,
forsaking the Truth once by them acknowledged and received, fell from the same,
to join with them in their erroneous doctrine.

Then proceeding further, having gotten and obtained higher Offices and
Dignities, not only by Princely authority, and virtue of their Offices, but
also by the Emperors Majesty's Regents, they found means to displace and
thrust diverse old and well-deseruing persons of the Kingdom out of their
Offices, and in the same to put other Captains and adherents of their own
Religion, and by them troubled and molested the people for Religion: causing
them, under pretense of temporal offenses, to be punished and tormented. And
such Ministers as, by authority from his Majesty, were permitted to preach the
Reformed Religion, in diverse Villages, they likewise displaced, and put others
therein of the contrary Religion. And in the Towns of Prague, they also took
such order, that those of the Papisticall Religion obtained the chiefest
Offices, who by subtle practices and threatenings, found means by their
importunities, to deal in such sort with diverse Officers, and Counselors of
the reformed Religion, that they were constrained to do whatsoever they desired
and commanded.

Forasmuch therefore, as that it touches us the Burghemasters and Council,
both of the old, new, and lesser Towns of Prague, which are of the Bohemian
Profession, and communicate under both kinds: That whereas we and our
Predecessors, as also the rest of the Cities professing the Religion, by a
full consent and agreement made by them and us, under our hands and Seals, at
a public Meeting, when any thing was to be done and handled touching the
Letters Patents, and the liberty of Religion, the principallest persons of the
said Towns and Religion, as also of all other Towns of the same Profession,
bound themselves faithfully to aid and assist one the other therein, upon
pain of incurring perpetual shame and infamy: As also, that by the tenor of
the said Letters Patents and Meetings, we were strictly bound, when or at what
time soever, the Protectors of our Religion, and of the University of Prage,
(having any thing concerning the said Letters Patents, and our Religion to be
determined and deliberated upon) together with themselves summoned, the Lords
of his Majesty's Council, and the Judges of both the Laws to determine the
same, there should six persons out of each Town of Prage, as also out of
every other Town of our Religion, be called to those Meetings: Which we did
not so well know, and that because at those Meetings, Offices in Towns and
Cities of this Realm were oftentimes innouated and changed; as also, that by
those of the contrary Religion, that sat and were mingled amongst us, and by
other means, we and our Protectors were much hindered in our proceedings; when
before the Emperors Majesty's departure from hence, express Commission was
given unto the Emperors Officers, all Papists, throughout the Towns of Prage,
that they, contrary to all ancient custom, should take upon them to enquire of
the foundations of the Reformed Churches, as also to deal and meddle with the
revenues thereof, and that without them and their consents, we neither could
nor should determine upon, nor dispose of any cause concerning our Religion in
any of our Dioces, as before we had done: All which tend to the annihilating
of his Majesty's liberty granted unto us by his Letters Patents, and of the
Union (wherein, among other things, is contained and set down, that as much as
concerning those of the Religion, as also their Churches, that the Emperors
Majesty should not trouble himself therewith, but that they of the Religion
themselves, without the Emperor, should end and determine the same) and were
thereunto persuaded by them, that for because the said Protectors, having twice
by their Letters summoned them to meet, we (contrary to ancient custom) sent
no man of our Religion thereunto: but with them of the contrary Sect, did
consult of things concerning our Religion (which they should not do) and
further wrote unto the Emperors Majesty, our Sovereign King, that we sent
no such unto the Council to deal or speak for us, and that so we agreed and
consented unto their said proceedings. Adding further, that all of us, with one
full and free consent, had agreed not to have any other Protector of our Cause
and Religion, but only the Emperors sacred Majesty: whereby what injury
might thereby hereafter be done unto us, and in the mean time, to all those of
our Religion, all men of equal and sound judgment may well see.

Wherefore, perceiving our selves to be deceived, and in an error; and
further, that it was told us, that as touching the supreme defense and
protection of our Religion in this Realm, in our Preface of the Bohemian
Confession, which is printed, this is therein openly comprehended and set down;
That all the three Estates of the reformed Religion, and their Protectors and
Consistories, would have no other Defender nor Protector (next under God) but
only the Emperors Majesty, our most gracious and Sovereign King, and those
to whom by the consent and certain knowledge of his sacred Imperial Majesty,
should by all the three Estates of the reformed Religion, be chosen to have the
oversight and care of their said Consistories.

For these, and many other just and reasonable causes, we the said superior
States, have at this present assembled together in the Castle of Prage, both
for, and in our names, and for those of all the three Estates of our religion
(which have not refused, nor gone back from the protection, which for our
religion is appointed, nor by no means will be drawn from it) by writing to
make our reasonable excuse in this case, unto his Imperial Majesty, and
therein have so much prevailed, that they once again have all faithfully
protested to join with us in the same; and We for our parts have undertaken
both presently, and promise in time to come, to maintain and uphold with all
our power and might, even to the last gasp, all whatsoever belongs,
appertains unto, or concerns the Emperors Letters Patents, and the Contents
thereof, for our defense, (so they be in such sort joined, as that the one
cannot subsist without the other) and be done with his Imperial Majesty's
consent. But that we the said three Estates of the reformed Religion may the
better charge these public enemies of the King, their Country, and the peace
thereof, and make it apparent what they have further practiced, it is, that
contrary to the lawful proceeding in the Assemblies of the State of the Land
to be holden, they have made and ordained themselves as partial Judges of his
Majesty's said Letters Patents, Assemblies and Union: And perceiving that his
sacred Imperial Majesty, our King and sovereign Lord, is otherwise employed
in diverse weighty affairs and business concerning the estate of Christendom
in general, and thereby is not able to remember and think upon all the
immunities and privileges, contracts, compacts, and grants concerning the
Realm; that they might set his Majesty at discord with the said three Estates
of the reformed religion, and to move him to grant such commission to them,
(which without doubt is contrary to the said Letters Patents,) they have given
out by writing to his Majesty, that in the said Letters Patents, and contract
of Union, it is not contained, that such subjects as are belonging unto
Cloisters, should have any right or authority to build themselves Churches;
whereas that is not referred to their own judgments, but as it is said
before, is committed to both parts, that is, that if any question should rise
thereof, lawful judgment and determination should be made and given therein
by an equal number of persons of both religions thereunto purposely appointed.

This notwithstanding, letting pass that manner of proceeding, at their
pleasures they procured a Commission from his Majesty, unto the Town of Bruna,
to command them to surcease from proceeding to build their Churches begun.
Which they of Bruna certifying to the Protectors and Superintendents of our
Religion, by us made and appointed thereunto, and therein sought to be helped,
desiring and requesting, that they might therein be aided and protected by
virtue of his Majesty's Letters Patents, and the Unity made at the Assembly of
the three Estates of the Realm, in the Parliament to that end holden: The
Protectors for their parts, upon good deliberation and advice by them taken,
thought it convenient to call the principal Officers, Judges, the Kings
Majesty's Council of both laws concerning the reformed Religion, and withal,
six persons of resort and Town (according to the Act of Parliament, and their
instruction therein) to assemble and meet together in Prague, where being
met, upon good deliberation they found, that not only those of Bruna, but also
all others that are subject unto the Spiritualty within the Realm of Bohemia,
(not only by the Articles which are in this our Apology set down in Print,
but also for other reasons and causes which here for breuity sake are omitted)
are participants of, and ought to enjoy the Benefits, Graces, and Privileges,
which belong, and are given by the Emperors Majesty's Letters Patents unto
those of the reformed Religion: The said Letters Patents among other things
specifying (that contrary to the same, and our securities, no Commission or
Prohibition, which in any sort might hinder, or let our proceedings, either
from his Imperial Majesty, and his Heirs or Successors, Kings of Bohemia, nor
by any other whatsoever: And that if any such should be given forth or
permitted, the same should be of no force nor validity in any such case, what
pretense or allegation soever should therein to the contrary be made, set
down, or pretended.)

Whereupon, when we the said three Estates and Protectors, upon good
deliberation and advice, had made and given this answer unto the inhabitants of
Bruna, the Hill towns, and Cloisters graves which are under the Archbishops of
Prage, that they should proceed to the building up of their Churches, and in the
same for the honor of God, use their accustomed manner of preaching, etc.
(always with this condition, that otherwise they should in all things behave
themselves peaceably, honestly, and ciuilly, and not to stir, move, nor give
occasion unto any one of the contrary Religion, much less to the Lord Abbot,
or the Archbishops, as being their Superiors, of the least cause of offense or
motion to anger whatsoever, either by word or deed, (as knowing well that the
same is specially, and expressly forbidden) but to the contrary, that they
should behave themselves toward them in all reasonable obedience concerning
worldly and politic matters, as true subjects ought to do.) All we of the
three Estates of the reformed Religion, at the Assembly holden in the Castle of
Prage, Anno 1615. by common consent of the Protectors, and under our hands in a
general and free Court, did approve, ratify, and confirm it, and also at that
Assembly made it known unto the Emperors Majesty, as to our King and Sovereign
Lord: as also diverse and sundry old wrongs, oppressions, and injuries which
were not only done and committed in the places aforesaid touching the Union,
but also to the prejudice of his Majesty's authority Royal, unto the common
people, contrary to the express meaning of his Majesty's Letters Patents,
hoping to procure some relief and redress therein, before our said Assembly
should break up.

The said common enemies of the King, the Country, and the Peace thereof,
continuing in their accustomed secret practices and devices, and persuading
themselves that they could work the Emperors Majesty as they list, they found
the means that our three Estates could in no manner get any answer from his
Majesty therein, before their Assembly brake up.

And further, besides that, certain persons by their means, at common and
ordinary Assemblies, Courts, and expeditions used all manner of hard
proceedings and courses against those of the Religion: at the last, they
proceeded so far, that they brought upon our three Estates of the Religion,
being the Emperors Majesty's true and faithful Subjects, (besides the former
ouer-heauy burdens laid upon us and our poor subjects) for the space of five
years, being most great and intolerable taxations and contributions (toward
the paying of his Majesty's debts) which we willingly granted unto, in hope
that the same would at length be a means of vnburthening us of our wrongs.
This notwithstanding, after our Assembly was broken up, (by the solicitation
of diverse of the Countries enemies) there could no answer from his Majesty be
given unto us, and much less any help or remedy was to be had therein, but to
the contrary, we were rather daily more and more wronged and oppressed, till at
the last, when his Imperial Majesty was ready to depart out of the Kingdom,
and going forward on his journey, lay at the Castle of Brandis, (by their
procurement) he called one of the Protectors unto him, Lord Henry Matthias,
Earl of Thurin, at that time Burgraue of Carlistein, etc. and in the presence
of two persons said to him, That he did not acknowledge nor understand the
three Estates of the reformed Religions petition concerning their grieuances,
to be true as they alleged, and that he had resigned his authority concerning
the protection of their cause unto the Archbishop of Prague, and that he would
be no more troubled therewith. And when the said Earl of Thurin humbly
besought his Imperial Majesty that he would be pleased not to commit the
charge of delivering that message unto him, forasmuch as it concerned all the
three Estates of the reformed Religion in general, desiring his Majesty that
it might please him to give order to the Lord Chancellor then being, to put the
same in writing, and deliver it unto him, and he would not fail to bear it
unto them to whom it appertained to deliberate further upon it: which although
his Majesty granted, and gave Commission to the said Lord Chancellor to do it,
yet could not the said written resolution from his Majesty be gotten nor
procured from the Chancellor, notwithstanding it had been often required and
sought for at his hands. And besides this, the Archbishop of Prage, commanded
the new Church at Cloystergraue (the building whereof cost a great sum of
money, and whereunto some of the Electors, Princes of Germany, and other
Noblemen, had liberally contributed) in contempt of the Gospel to be defaced,
thrown down, utterly spoiled, and laid even with the ground: And likewise
commanded those of Bruna (contrary to the Union) to deliver their Church unto
the Abbot, and not to use it, and to leave the keys thereof in the Chancerie
of Bohemia: which because they denied to do, and desired that they might still
have the use thereof, diverse of the principallest persons among them were cited
to appear in the Castle of Prage, and there with great weeping, crying, and
clamor, made by their wives and children, were held prisoners.

This being done, in such manner as you have heard, and among many other
things, diverse and sundry grieuances and oppressions in several places still
were committed and done, and from the said places certified unto the
Protectors, who by the common people were blamed and taxed, and charged not to
have done their best endeavors to let and withstand them: We the chief
Officers, the Kings Majesty's Council, and Judges of both Laws; as also six
persons out of every Jurisdiction of the Religion assembled together in Prage
at a certain day thereunto appointed: where being met, we with them,
deliberately considering upon the matter, desiring to proceed peaceably and
quietly therein, did nothing else in that Assembly, but only agreed, that by
submissiue Supplications, one directed to the Regent, the other to his sacred
Majesty, which we sent unto Viana, we would humbly crave that his Majesty
would be pleased to stay those violent proceedings, and withal to cause those
Citizens of Bruna, that were detained prisoners, to be forthwith released: And
to that end also we by writing desired the States of the Marquisdome of
Morauia, the Princes and States of upper and nether Siletia, and the States of
the Marquisdome of higher and lower Lusuitz, being Provinces incorporated unto
this Kingdom, that in submissiue manner they would vouchsafe to petition unto
his sacred Majesty for us. Which done, we presently agreed with the Protectors
to meet together another day, in the Emperor Charles the fourth his College,
the Monday after Rogation Sunday last past, about the same matter, if in the
mean time we received no answer from his Majesty of our petition. But upon
the said day, when we met again, according to our determination, we
understood, that in all that time there was no answer, touching the same, comne
from his Majesty, and also that our troubles and oppressions were not stayed,
nor diminished: but to the contrary, by the means, procurements, and malice of
our enemies, that his Majesty had written a sharper letter unto the Regent,
therein not only blaming the Protectors, but also all us of the three Estates
of the Reformed Religion, willing him to certify the same unto the Protectors;
the Contents thereof being as follows.

1 First, that his sacred Majesty the Emperor understood, and esteemed, that
the same our meeting and Assembly, was wholly done and called, against the
supreme Authority of his Imperial and Kingly person.

2 That both the demolishing of the Church in the City of Cloystergraue, and
the punishing of the disobedient Citizens of the Town of Bruna, belonging to
the Cloister, were both done by his Majesty's own permission and commandment.

3 That we had proceeded further in those cases, then his Majesty's Letters
Patents permitted, or authorized to the States of either of the two Religions.

4 And lastly, that we had used and retained Strangers in matters unlawful,
and that we maintained and defended their open disobedience and mutinies
against his Imperial Majesty, and sought to support them therein, which his
Majesty did little expect at the hands of some of those that were the Authors
of those proceedings.

Adding further (that seeing we abused his Majesty's gracious favor and
clemency, and sought to proceed further in those matters then we ought) his
Majesty would not fail to look better into, and to enquire more thereof; and
therein to do justice, and to punish every one of the Offenders in that manner,
according to their deserts: Prohibiting the Defenders in the mean time, until
his Majesty's return into that Kingdom; or upon further order therein by him
to be taken, not to summon such meetings any more: Withal, willing the Lord
Regent, to certify and to warn the Townes-men and Inhabitants, by any means,
not to appear upon any such Summons, nor to join with us, as in the said
Letters more at large appears.

Which Letter, We, the said States, little suspected or expected; much less,
that by the means and crafty instigation of our said Enemies, in stead of
obtaining our request, we should (without hearing) by his Majesty, be judged
faulty, and forthwith condemned as guilty, as if the matter or cause were true
indeed, as they upon bad and false information had, by their Writings, informed
his Majesty; persuading themselves that if his Majesty (maliciously and
craftily informed) in his Letters did avouch, and charge us, that We against
the Prerogative of his sacred Imperial Person, and Kingly Authority, had
summoned and called Assemblies of the Religion together, and that we
maintained foreign Subjects in things unjust, against his sacred Majesty, and
likewise vpheld and protected them in their manifest presumptions and
conspiracies, against his Imperial Dignity, and strengthened them therein:
which things, in the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom, are expressly (upon
capital pain and grievous punishment) prohibited and forbidden.

Which although we had not done, and were afterward by some of our enemies
themselves cleared thereof, before his Imperial Majesty; nevertheless (being
animated thereby, and having the Emperors said Letters in their hands, which
they caused to be published and read among themselves, in contempt of Us, and
our Religion) they sufficiently showed how ready they were, as soon as any of
us should, by course of Law be called in question, for any such cause, before
judgment should pass upon us (through malice in their hearts conceived
against us) to verify and confirm the same.

For it is most certain, that it was done by themselves in their secret
Meetings, and that the Letter was penned by them in Prage, and sent unto his
Imperial Majesty to set his hand thereunto: Whereby it is evident, that if
we were to be judged by them, that to their own shame and confusion, they
could allege no other thing then this against us. But when as hitherto they
cannot, neither dare openly assault or set upon us, yet under pretense of Right
and Justice, they seek to bring us (that are honest men and his Majesty's true
and faithful Subjects) to satisfy their pleasures, into utter ruin, and
loss of goods, to the great sorrow and grief of our wives, children, and
friends, wholly to extinguish our Religion: And all, whatsoever we, by the
Kings Majesty's Letters Patents, as also the Concord, Union, and Agreement
publicly made for our Religion with those of the contrary side in Court of
Parliament, and acknowledged and confirmed to be a Law and Statute of this
Kingdom, wholly to annihilate and overthrow, and by that means to stop and
bar the Protectors, and all of us, (when any danger were likely to fall upon
us) from daring to call and assemble us together, to prevent the same: Then the
which, what can be more dangerous and perilous unto us?

Which troubles, by them craftily brought upon us, and their sinister practices
against us, we seeking to eschew and prevent, when by means of their crafty
conspiracies, we could have no answer from his sacred Imperial Majesty of
our humble petitions; as also that his Majesty, by the strange practices of
them, and others their adherents, was so persuaded, that he believed all
whatsoever they falsely devised and alleged; and would by no means credit,
nor hear us speak for our selves: Insomuch as that the very name of the
Reformed Religion, and Protectors thereof, was most odious in his Majesty's
ears, which they themselves lewdly were so bold every where to boast and brag
of.

Besides this, as it is evidently known to all men, when they would call any
honest man in question, they used all the means they could (though it were
against all right, reason, or orderly proceeding) to bring many men, by strange
devices, into the danger of loss of life and goods; specially, such as were of
the Reformed Religion: and by their judgments and decrees, made black seem
white, and white black: the Kings faithful and true Subjects, disloyal; and
his disloyal subjects, just and true; raising and advancing evil and unfit
persons to honorable Estates and Dignities; and disgracing and defaming such
as were worthy of honor and desert; cruelly handling, and strangely dealing
with, not only their own Subjects, but those also of the Kingdom, as well
under his Majesty's Dominion, as the Spiritualty, for matters of Religion; and
against their wills, cruelly (contrary to the manifest decrees of the Union)
forced and compelled them to be of their Papisticall Religion: And by the Kings
Judges menaces and threatenings, brought diverse of the Cities to that point,
that they were compelled, that they should no more vnder-write to be obedient
at the Calling and Summons of those of the Reformed Religion, nor any more to
assemble and meet together with them; and many other indirect courses. And
being asked by us, whether they themselves were the Authors and Deuisers of the
Letter, and condemnation aforesaid made against us, they could not deny it.

For these causes aforesaid, we have proceeded against two of their League and
Confederacy: the one called William Slawatam of Chulin, and Cos-chumberk; the
other Iawslaws Borzita, of Martinitz, otherwise called Smetsanckii, as
perturbers and violaters of the Laws and common-peace of the Land: who, for
that not respecting their Offices wherein they were placed, have most
shamefully and wickedly abused the same, to the great dishonor of his sacred
Imperial Majesty, our sovereign Kings authority, and the breach of the peace
of this Realm, and have put both of them together, with the Secretary their
Prouoker, and as it were bondslaue, who with them has sown and raised many
factions and seditions in the Towns of Prage; having first found and proved
them to be such persons as in truth they are, according to the old accustomed
manner, out of their Offices and Dignities. Against whom certainly (because
they are yet living) as also the goods and revenues of them, and of all
others, that defend and excuse them; or that will tax, assail, or accuse
(...) for the same: and bewale against as many others, the violaters of the
said Letters Patents, and Union, as we can by any means find out (specially
against Paul Michna, a most wicked, pestiferous man; a Traitor and violater of
the Laws and public peace of the Land, who from base and mean Parentage,
being advanced to the Secretaries place of the Chancerie in Bohemia, in short
time waxt so proud, that he, together with our said Enemies, did usurp and
take upon him the whole government and administration in this Kingdom, over
the States, and made himself fellow with the principal Officers and Judges of
the Land: and despising or contemning them, boldly and rashly thrust himself
into matters which belonged not unto him, and by deceits and craft wrought many
mischiefs in this Land, raised factions, troubles and contentions, and by all
the means he could, labored, and sought to bereave the States of the Reformed
Religion of all their Privileges, and now is gone and absenteth himself out
of the Country) whom we will condignely punish according to his and their
deserts. To the which end, for the good of his Imperial Majesty, and this
Kingdom, our native Country, and for the defense of our wives and children, as
also of the whole Realm, from al wrong and mischief, we now at this present,
assembled our selves in the Castle of Prage, which we have not done of purpose
in any sort to oppose our selves against the authority Royal of his Imperial
Majesty, our most gracious King, and sovereign Lord, or to wrong or hurt our
loving friends and (...) of the contrary Religion (so they will live in peace)
since it is manifestly known that hereby no other Secular or Ecclesiastical
person is hurt or hindered, nor any tumult or sedition made, but throughout all
the Towns of Prage, as also throughout the whole Realm, Peace shall be
observed and kept, unless it be in such causes as are before rehearsed, and
not to be avoided, and wherein we neither ought, nor can possibly do less then
we have done. Wherefore we hope, that his Imperial Majesty, our most gracious
King and sovereign Prince, will not otherwise interpret our meanings and
actions, nor give credit to our slanderous and malicious enemies: Neither do we
think that our fellow-subiects and friends of the contrary Religion, for
whatsoever we shall justly do, or have done, against those that are violaters
and perturbers of the Letters Patents, Covenants, Conditions, Immunities,
Peace, and common Unity of this Realm, or that hereafter shall be done; and
much less any other, in their own, or other men's names, either openly or
secretly, will for that cause, declare or show himself to be our enemy: But
rather hope, that every man, well weighing, considering, and calling to mind
the reasons and causes aforesaid, and the just deserts and merits of the said
persons, as also that our meaning and intent is not, nor never was, in the
least manner, or in any sort, to do any thing against the Emperors Majesty,
our most gracious sovereign Kings authority, or against the Romish Religion,
and the Union between us made; will not only excuse, but also take part with
us, and aid us (in all things that concern the preservation of the
Privileges and Immunities of this Realm, together with the concord and
mutual love, peace, and amity thereof) against all those that withstand it.
Therefore we most humbly beseech his Imperial Majesty, our most gracious
King and sovereign Prince, that it would please him (if need shall require) to
publish another, and more large Apology, for our excuse and justification unto
the world.

Given in the Castle of Prage, in our common Assembly, upon Friday, next after
the Feast of the Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ. Ann. 1618.

Reasons whereby it is showed and proved, that the people of Bohemia, that are
Subjects to the Monasteries and Clergy of the same Realm, in their resorts,
by the Letters Patents, and the Union, contracted and made between those of
the Reformed Religion, and the Papists, have liberty to build themselves
Churches, and freely to exercise their Religion therein, without interruption.
1 FIRST, it is declared, and expressly set down in his Majesty's Letters
Patents, that all the united members of the Reformed Religion, viz. the Lords,
and Knights, as also those of Prage, Ruttenbergh, and other Towns, together
with their Subjects; and, briefly, all those that make profession of, and
acknowledge the Bohemian Confession, no man excepted, shall and may freely and
peaceably in all places, exercise their Christian Religion of communicating
under both kinds, according to the said Confession, and the Unity made, and
shall be suffered quietly to profess and confess their faith and Religion
without interruption.

2 That from the day of the date thereof, none of the superior free Estates,
nor any of the Cities, Towns, nor Country people shall, neither by their
Magistrates, nor any other person whatsoever, Spiritual or Temporal, be
troubled for their said Religion, neither by force or violence be constrained
or compelled to exercise the contrary Religion by any means whatsoever.

3 Thirdly, that against the said Privilege, no Counter-mand, nor any other
prohibition which may in any sort be, or procured, the least impediment or
alteration thereof, from his Imperial Majesty, his Heirs and Successors,
Kings of Bohemia, shall not be made nor granted: and if any such thing shall
happen, or be enterprised and taken in hand by any one, it shall be of no force
nor vigor; neither shall there be any further pursuit thereof made in Law, or
otherwise directly or indirectly whatsoever.

4 That his Imperial Majesty certifieth and gives all supreme Officers, both
present and future, to understand, that it is his will and pleasure, that the
Barons, Knights, Towns of Prage, Ruttenbergh, and other places, together with
all their Subjects; and namely, all those that profess the Reformed Religion,
and acknowledge the Bohemian Confession, by virtue of his Majesty's Letters
Patents, shall be suffered and permitted by them, and every of them, freely to
enjoy all the Articles, Clauses, and Sentences therein set down and declared,
and no hinderance, let, nor interruption to be done unto them for the same, by
any man; but to the contrary, that they shall aid, help, and assist them
therein to the uttermost of their powers: And if it shall happen that any
Spiritual, or Temporal person shall do any thing contrary to his said
Majesty's Letters, or to the end thereby to disanull or interrupt the same, his
said Majesty shall and will, as also his Heirs and Successors, Kings of
Bohemia, and the States of this Realm, every one of them for their parts,
proceed against every such persons, as against perturbators of the common Peace
and Tranquillity of the Law, and will defend and protect the said States of the
Reformed Religion, in all respects, as the Articles in the Statute of the Union
concerning the peace of the Land, contain and import.

5. And in the Articles of Union between both the religions, for the better
explaning of the Letters Patents, as also in the Exchequer or Office of the
Rowls or Records of the Realm, in Quaterno Emptionum argenteo, Anno 1609. it
is inserted in these words, That in such places or Cities under the Kings,
Queens, or the Emperors Majesty's regiment, those of the reformed Religion,
that have not their own particular Churches, places of burial, nor any places
among those of the contrary religion, by virtue of his Majesty's Letters
Patents, shall have power to make and prepare Churches, Hospitals, and Burying
places for themselves whenever they will.

6. In the conjunction of the States of the Religion in Bohemia, and the
Papists, with the Princes and States of the Duchy of Silesia, these words are
inserted. Whosoever, unless it be the Emperors Majesty himself, (whether he
be a Spiritual, or a Temporal person, of what dignity or condition soever,
none excepted) either in his Imperial Majesty's name, his own, or any others
whatsoever, shall go about, or attempt to trouble or molest the Lords of the
three Estates of the Crown of Bohemia, or the Princes and States of Silesia,
or Slesia, that are of the Ausburge Confession, or any of the Subjects of the
same profession, whether they be under Spiritual or Temporal, Catholic or
Evangelical jurisdiction in their Christian religion, Churches, Schools, or
Consistories, in any manner, or under any pretense whatsoever of right
belonging before to the Catholic foundatio^s, Cloisters, Churches, Schools,
Consistories, Rents, In-comes, or Revenues, and now at this present are used
and enjoyed by these of the reformed Religion in both countries, and still
remain so, and would molest them for the same, it shall be lawful for all
the said States of the reformed Religion, to join and stand fast altogether,
and to do their uttermost endeavor to the last drop of blood in their bodies,
for the defense of the reformed Religion, Churches, Schools and Consistories,
and their appurtenances, and to hold and keep the same for their security: And
that whenever they or any of their subjects or others of their profession,
that are under temporal or spiritual jurisdiction, as aforesaid, are troubled
or vexed, or by any Magistrate assaulted or assailed violently, under, or by
what means or pretense soever it be, as if they were seditious and Rebels, or
otherwise, (as the enemies of God and his Word are wont to do, and daily
practice the same, as we commonly see.) The said three Estates of the reformed
Religion in the Kingdom of Bohemia, upon the first motion thereof made unto
them by the Princes and States of Silesia, within one month then next after
ensuing, shall levy one thousand horsemen, and two thousand footmen; at the
second time, the like number; and at the third time, all the forces in Silesia,
to aid and assist them: and the like shall be done by the Princes and States
of Silesia, in the Bohemians behalf, if need require. Which their said
conjunction, action, and unity, his Imperial Majesty shall fully and evidently
confirm and allow.

7. In his Majesty's Letters Patents given and granted to those of Silesia, it
is likewise expressly signified and set down, that all the Subjects of the
Provinces of Silesia, whether they be under Spiritual or Temporal Princes,
Commanders, or hereditary Princes of Dutchies, Cities, Towns and Villages, and
other Magistrates, none excepted, shall be therein comprehended, in these
words: That none of them, whether they live under spiritual or temporal power
and jurisdiction, shall be compelled to use any other religion then that they
profess, neither shall be sent away, or banished from his dwelling place, nor
put from his office or dignity for religion, or in any sort vexed, molested or
troubled for his conscience.

These Letters Patents granted to Silesia, were after ours, and by us and our
means proceeded, neither were they largelier made to them, then to us, nor
unto us then to them; and yet we as the superior members, cannot be of worse or
meaner condition: besides this, the Articles in our Letters Patents, are
generally and compendiously contained, but in the Silesian Patent, more
expressly and particularly declared.

8. At the making of his Majesty's Letters Patents touching the Union, it was
not otherwise meant nor intended, then that the Cloisters are his Imperial
Majesty's princely goods and revenues, and that he, as the superior, has full
power over them, as it is sufficiently known unto them that then were present
at the time of the making of the contract.

9. That in the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Spiritualty have no singular state as
those of Morauia and other Provinces have, neither have any voice in
Parliament, but are distinguished and ordered by the Emperors Majesty among the
other States, in all things concerning them.

10. That all Ecclesiastical goods be of the Archbishopricke, as also of all
the rest by superior right, and are under the power and disposition of the
Kings of Bohemia, as the highest and supremest founders and Patrones thereof.

11. That the same Ecclesiastical goods by the Statutes of the Land, D. 40.
belong to the Kings Exchequer or reuenew; wherefore, according to a Statute of
the Realm, Anno 11. no College nor Cloister, without the Kings consent, can
alienate or change any thing belonging thereunto, and if they do pawn, sell,
change, or alienate any thing thereof, it shall be of no force, and that
whosoever does take any thing of them in that sort, he shall restore the same
again freely unto the King, or to any other to whom it shall please the King
to appoint him to do it.

12. That Spiritual men are feodaries and admiuistrators of their temporal
goods, only for their lifetime, and so they ought to understand it; for that
the Kings of Bohemia always had right and power over their spiritual goods,
to sell the same unto any of the inhabitants of the Land, without the consent
of the said Spiritual persons, and to alienate and make them hereditary, and
to record them for such in the Records of the Exchequer or Rowles: whereof many
examples are extant in the reigns of Ferdinando, Maximilian, and Rodulphus,
Emperors and Kings of Bohemia.

FINIS.
