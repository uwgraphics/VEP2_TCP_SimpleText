Here begins a treatise of a galau^t
Right as small flodes increase to waters fell
So that narowe furrous may not sustain
Right so pride unclosed may not counsel
This new wretchedness yt causes us co^playn
How woe has wrapped us in a cruel chain
Our pride shows it well both far and nere
England may wayle that ever it came here
The sin that now reygneth to behold is ruthe
Of fraud and dysceyte great abhomynacyon
But need constrayneth us now to say the truth
Of pride and dysceyte this new dyscymulacyon
That blyndeth and consumes our english nacyon
Lucyfers progenye among us does appear
England may wayle that ever it came here
Right late stood our land in such prosperyte
Of chyualry / manhood / and rich marchaundyse
Thrughe all christian realms sprange our felycyte
Of great wealth and pro wesse in sundry wise
Our sadness is changed for the new guyse
we have exyled our wealth I note where
England may wayle that ever it came here
Pride has found way to exclude man fro blys
In dysfygurynge nature by this new array
Both men and women can say what it is
For both need and pouerte gooth now right gaye
But alas our sorrow increases every day
And if ye live long ye shall both se and here
That England shall wayle that ever it came here
For pride has our plente turned to evil fare
And fedeth us as beestes that draws in the ploughe
Many a worthy man brings he to sorrow and care
where fortune sometime fresshely on him loughe
Examyne the living that this world uses enough
How need with sin grows every where
England may wayle that ever it came here
For many a veugeaunce as scripture makes mencyon
Path fallen to kyngomes in sundry wise
And finally put the people in dystruccyon
For their obstynacy / a new fangle guyse
Alas England that sometime was so wise
Other nacyons refuse / have bought so dear
That thou may wayle that ever it came here
Sometime we had France in great derysyon
For their hateful pride and lothesome uncleanness
Use we not now / the same in our regyon
And have permuted our welthe for their gladness
Lechery of our people is become a maystres
Our gentylnes / for galantyse have we left there
England may wayle that ever it came here
if ye behold the galantes progenye vyperius
That out of France be fled for their intoxicacyon
Has now vengeance consumed / that realm gloryus
For their pride and sinful abhomynacyon
That all the world may wayle their desolacyon
O France why ne had these galauntes byden there
England may wayle that ever it came here
For in this name galau^t ye may express
Seven lettres for some cause in especyall
That fygureth ye.vij. deedly sins and their wretchedness
By whom man is made to the devil thrall
was not pride cause of Lucyfers fall
Pride is in hell / and galauntes nygheth them nere
England may wayle that ever it came here
O thou gaye galaunte by thyn unthrifty name
with gabbynge and glosynge getest that thou have
Gyle was thy fader and Ialousye thy dame
In getting / in Jangling thy days ben past
For all thy glorious going / aege gnaweth fast
Thy glased life and glotony / be glewed so in fere
That england may wayle that ever it came here
Appetytes of auaryce / be to them so amerous
Ambusyon and arrogaunce ben of one affynyte
Adventure and anger ben aye so debatous
Feynynge estate of counterfeit auctoryte
Adulacyon of adventure / may thou not auaunt the
As a liar in goodness in thyn array do appear
England may wayle that ever it came here
For all thy loud lechery / thou lepest so fast about
That good love and law ben almoost lorue
Of lust and liking ledest thou such a route
That laches and lechery have clennes to torn
Thou labors to lose / that thy friends gate toforne
For lewednes and lechery ben so led in fere
Englonge may wayle that ever it came here
Abhomynable accydyo accuses all our nacyon
Our aungelyke abstynence is now refused
Ferthermore of Antecryste this new dyssymulacyon
Alas that such sorrow among us is used
Our auaryce and hatered have us so accused
That diverse aduersytees sueth us year by year
England may wayle that ever it came here
For our wasting wretchedness yt has waded so deep
In our wanton werynge of clothes to torn
To wyldnes and wrath the world takes most keep
For in wasting and vanyte / men reken not what is lorne
For wife and for women / for ware the horn
That virtuous virgynyte is deed and laid on bear
England may wayle that ever it came here
The noble course of nature nycete has devoured
For need / needs be so it causes our desolacyon
So has these new fangles our welthe obscured
That neclygence nouryssheth necessyte to our confusyon
This causes our galauntes by their nacyon
Neuerthryfte and tryfles / noye ever us so nere
England may wayle that ever it came here
For trygetours and tryflours that tauernes haunte
Have troth and temporaunce trodden under foot
Talewes and talking and drinking ataunte
As tyrauntes and tractours / toyllous in moote
Till they be tried out is there no boot
And trysed to baratrum / tossed in fere
Englonge shall wayle that ever it came here
O galaunt upon galaunt / and o thou galaunt gaye
And thou ruskyn galaunt that pouerte does menace
For all thy warrocked hoode and thy proud array
And thy parrocked pouche that thou so fast do brace
Thou besyest the to counterfeit Lucyfets trace
Think not to long or thou dwell with him there
Our men with cloutes at their breast like a pie
Our women have debated with shamefastnes
And our men with uncleanness if I shall not lie
O England thou may weep with Ieromye
Seeing the people thus led by the ere
England may wayle that ever it came here
Our women in their part labor as they may
In their array with chere and countynaunce
Our men on their side make them fresshe and gay
And labor to purchase women's pleasaunce
Thus between both grows much myschaunce
Each seeks sin as it does appear
England may wayle that ever it came here
Our gala^ntes live in lusts as beestes
Maynteynours of quarelles and vnthryftynes
Our shameless women with their high creestes
Extorcyon / robbery / and our vngentylnes
Prelates neclyge^ce / lords rauayn / merchants deceytes
These asks vengeance / this lesson must ye lere
Else shall ye wayle that ever it came here
Behold these days the people of our nacyon
Are charged with sin / and governed by folly
How need will compelle us by transmygracyon
with very woe drive us in to Babylonye
O England where is now thy glory
That sometime shone thrughe the world so clear
well may you wayle that ever this sorrow came here
All people labor of this new dysguysynge
In forgynge their fantasyes to maynteyne pride
He is now wysest that can most of deuysynge
For the cursed ensample that thou show here
So many barefoote people / and so few good lyuers
Has no man seen sith the world began
So many styropes and so few good chyuallers
And so many braynles that little good can
Men arrayed as women and women as man
This causes death / that all thing is so dear
England may wayle that ever it came here
So much richesse in array and so much need
So many bedes borne and so little devotion
So much fasting for hungre and so little mede
So much painted worship / and so little reason
I trow no man has seen in this little regyon
Our sin asks vengeance / I am in great fere
In short time we shall wayle that ever it came here
How many points were they now a days
And yet a good point among them were to synde
Daggers of vengeance ready to make affrayes
with long taters down to the ars behind
Tryppynge with small sha^kes as light as lefe on lynde
To make it toughe and fresshe as it were the new year
England may wayle that ever it came here
So many purfled garments furred with no sequitur
with so many penylesse purses has no man saw
Small gyrdynge in the waast with all their other
That we go all back ward from high to the law
ye florysshing mede of our wealth we have bego^ to mawe
But we beseech god amend us an other year
Or else we shall wayle that ever it came here
Our women are dyspoyled and give them to wantonness
Good making of man is now laid on side
This new array is brought up in this land so wide
And yet for all that it may not last a year
England may wayle that ever it came here
Behold the rolled hodes stuffed with flocks
The new broched doublettes open at the breasts
Stuffed with pectoll of their loves smockes
Their gowns and their cotes shredde all in lystes
So many capes as now be / and so few good priests
I can not reken half the route of their marde gere
England may wayle that ever it came here
These galauntes use also full abhomynable
Their typpettes be wrythen like to a chain
And they go haltred in them as horse in the stable
It is a peryllous pronostycacyon certain
For sinful souls shall be bound in pain
Hand and foot in perpetual sire
They shall curse the time that ever it came here
All these new bulwarks they were at their knees
They labor sore in their wits fantasyes to find
No man holds him content with his degrees
Pride gothe before and shame comes behind
Alas that English men should be so blind
So much sorrow among us and so little fere
we may wayle the time that ever it came here
Forgete not lightly how many strangers
Have entered this kingdom and kept the possessyon
Five times as writes old cronyclers
And changed our tongues in sundry dyuysyon
O clergy pray for our English nacyon
That god for his mercy of this sin make us clear
Else shall we wayle that ever it came here
Effectually pray god for his reformacyon
Of welte / manhood / and of marchaundyse
And tresory of peace / that christ in his passion
Left between god and man when he should dye
The comynalte in love / conserve perseuerauntlye
with tharyte both high and low to Join in fere
In boydynge of sin that tourmenteth us here
O England remember thyn old sadness
That thou may resort again to thy gladness
Exyle pride relyeue to thy goodness
Sin has consumed this worlds humanyte
Pray god thou may rejoice thyn old felycyte
And his blessed mother / as this land is her dowere
we have no cause to wayle that ever it came here
