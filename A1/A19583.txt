A HANDFVL: OR Rather a Heartfull of holy meditations and Prayers.

Gathered out of certain ancient Manuscripts, written 300 years ago, or more.

By WILLIAM CRASHAW Batchelour of Divinity, and Preacher at the Temple.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE LORD: HENRY THE Noble Earl of NORTHHAMPTON, Lord
privy Seal, Lord Warden of the Cincque Ports, and one of his Majesty's
Honorable privy Counsel.
RIGHT Honorable, our Adversaries amongst their many objections against us and
our Religion, use this for one, that if we refuse their Church, and condemn
their faith, we condemn to hell all our forefathers. But it follows not:
for in such fundamental points as necessarily concern salvation, as matter of
merit, and means of Justification, etc. our fathers in former times were not
of the Romish faith, but of our Religion: excluding, disclayming, and
renouncing all their own merits, and cleaving only to Gods mercy, and the
merits of Jesus Christ for their salvation. This was the faith of the ancient
Church, etc. Saint Basillius in homel in Psalm. 114.
Basil says. Eternal rest remains for them which have fought a good fight in
this world, yet not for the merit of their works, but through the rich mercies
of God, in whom they trust.

Saint Hillary says, our Hilarious in Psalm. 51.
works suffice not to merit eternal life, but our hope is in the mercy of God
for ever and ever.

Saint Augustine says, Augustinus concione 1 in Psalm. 70. Tua peccata sunt,
merita Dei sunt: supplicium tibi debetur, et cum praemium venerit sua dona
coronabit non tua merita.
Sin is ours, Merit is Gods: Punishments are our due, but if rewards come, God
crowns his own gifts, not our merits.

Gregory moral lib. 9. ca. 14.
Saint Gregory (a Pope) says, If I do well, I shall have eternal life, not by
my merits but Gods mercy.

And long after even in Bernardus sermon. 15. in Psalm. 90.
the darkest times; deuote Bernard says, A man's whole merit is to put the
whole affiance of his heart in him, that has saved the whole man, and therefore
in another place he concludes, My merit is the mercy of the Lord.

All these Bellarmine cannot Sermon 61. in Cant. meritum meum miseratio domini.
deny, and himself produces some of them or all, but shapes such answers to
them, as it would satisfye an indifferent man even to read him in that pont.

And this was not the faith Bellar. to. 4. lib. 5. de lust. cap. 6.
of the principal Fathers only, but by the mercy of God, it was derived even
unto the inferior, and vulgar sort, not of the Clergy alone, but even of the
Laity also.

If the monuments of elder ages were extant and uncorrupted, it is more the^
maruailous how clearly this truth would shine: that our forefathers were not
damned, though they believed, not as does the present Romish Church: Nay
further that they were saved by the same faith by which we are at this day,
though they were misled by some errors, and nusled in some superstitions; for
which (being sins of infirmity, or rather of ignorance) we hope the Lord was
merciful unto them, knowing that even David himself cried to God to cleanse
Psalm. 19.
him from his secret sins.

But such has been the craft and malice of Popish policy, that partly the
oldest books are embezilled and extinguished, and those that remain are so
altered corrupted and depraved from that they were, that there now remains not
one of many of the testimonies, which the former ages yielded to this truth.

Notwithstanding the providence of God has not failed his Church: for (do what
they could) yet he who said the gates of hell Math. 16.
should not prevail against the true faith, has taken order in spite of all
plots to the contrary, that so many testimonies shall be preserved, as shall
sufficiently witness to the world that our faith flourished in former ages.

My purpose is (if the Lord will) to gather up such Antiquities though they be
scattered and almost lost in these old worm eaten Manuscripts wherein they lie
buried, which as Gods providence has delivered from the force and fury of the
inquisitors fire, so it is al Christians duties to preserve them to posterity.

I have here begun with a Handful, or rather a Hartfull of holy prayers and
meditations worthy to be worn in the hand, and borne in the heart of every
Christian, by which it may evidently appear that the faith and Religion of the
former ages, four and five hundred years ago, was even the same by which we
look to be saved at this day.

Let this have leave (right Honorable) to come abroad out of the corners of
obscurity, into public view, in the light and luster of your renowned name,
who are known to be a reuerencer of Antiquity, a Mecaenas of learning, a
practiser of piety, an enemy to the idolatry, superstitions, ambitious
practices, traitorous devices, and Machiauellian plots of Jesuits: and a
detester of such especially, who under a pretense of Religion, do cloak and
convey impieties against God, and against his anointed.

The God of heaven confirm that blessed work of his in your Lordship more and
more, to the glory of his name, the benefit of this Realm, and to your own
salvation in Christ Jesus: So prays

Your Lordships devoted in Christ, W. CRASHAW.

An Orthodoxall Confession of God the Father.
FIrst and last one God divine,
All men's God as well as mine.
In thy virtue all things framing,
In thy knowledge all containing.
In thine essence chiefest good,
Working all what e're is good.
All supporting, all excelling,
Without all, yet in all dwelling.
All supporting vndeiected,
All excelling unaffected.
Without all, yet not excluded,
In all, never yet included.
Over all in Domination,
Under all in sustentation.
Comprehending all without thee,
Filling all things round about thee.
Nothing under thee can raise thee,
Naught above thee can debase thee.
Naught without gives thee dimension,
Naught within gives thee extension.
Moving all, thy self abiding,
Placed without circumscribing.
Changing time, thy self most stable,
Varying all, Inuariable.
Force, necessity, nor art,
Alter thee in any part.
Time past, present, and to come,
Are one with thee, both all and some.
All the glory now thou have.
Vndiminisht aye must last.
Only thou art all foreseeing,
Only giving all their being.
As thy wisdom did foreshow,
Thou framd'st the elements below.
A holy and orthodoxall Confession of God the Son, Jesus Christ the Savior of
Mankind.
Son, thy Fathers peer in all,
with him Consubstantiall.
His figure and his splendour pure,
Creator, made a creature.
Thou our humane flesh putst on,
Thou our cause have undergone.
Temporal, yet time defying,
Ever living, yet once dying.
God and man without illusion,
Both in one without confusion.
Thy Fathers like in Deity,
But not in fleshly verity.
God humanity assuming,
The same preserving, not consuming
The Godhead in this union yet,
Of his Godhead lost no whit.
God to God, and not to the other*
Was Father, but Mary to both was mother
Thus both natures kept their station,
In this wondrous Combination.
Preserving in the Essence true
What was, and thence producing new.
This our Mediator is,
Our leader to the land of bliss.
Circumcised babtis'd by John,
Suffered, buried, and upon,
The third day: whence he had descended,
He rose, and so to heaven ascended.
Whence he shall come, when time does call
(Tho Judged himself) to judge us all.
Of Christ again.
HE whom Gods power for mankind would have borne,
whom borne his miracles proclaimed have,
Who thus proclaimed upon a cross was torn,
To whom thus torn, the godly burial gave:
This borne, proclaimed, torn Entombed King,
God power again, to heavenly bliss did bring:
A true and orthodoxall Confession of the holy Ghost.
SPirit uncreated ever,
Never made, begotten never.
From the persons two proceeding,
Full their equal, not exceeding.
Not preferring them in Deity,
Nor several from them in quality.
In quantity all three combine,
In quality alike Divine.
With the Father and the Sun,
Never ending nor begun.
One is Father, for he begot,
The Son one borne, all men wot
From these the spirit proceeds alone,
Thus one is three, and three are one.
Each of these is God truly,
Yet still but one, and not Gods three
But in this Deity, I asseuer,
A Trinity united ever.
In the substance is full unity,
In the persons perfect Trinity:
But, in these that I have reckoned,
None in power is first or second.
But allas one we must adore,
Fixed and firm for evermore.
Nor in self for ever changed,
Nor from it self at all estranged.
The conclusion with a devour and holy prayer.
THis is Christian faith unfeigned,
Orthodoxall, true, unstained:
As I teach all understand;
Yielding unto neither hand.
And in this my souls defense,
Reject me not for mine offense:
Though deaths slave, yet desperation
I fly, in death, to seek salvation
I have no mean, thy love to gain,
But this faith which I maintain
This thou see, nor will I cease,
By this to beg for a release.
Let this sacred salve be bound,
Upon my sores to make them sound.
Though man be carried forth, and lying
In his grave, and putrefying:
Bound and hid from mortal eyes,
Yet if thou bid, he must arise:
At thy will the grave will open
At thy will his bounds are broken.
And forth he comes, without delay;
If thou but once bid come away:
In this sea of dread and doubt,
My poor bark is tossed about;
With storms and pirates far and wide,
Death and woes on every side.
Come thou steeresman ever blessed,
Calm these winds, that me molest:
Chase these ruthlesse Pirates hence,
And show me some safe residence.
My tree is fruitless, dry and dead,
All the bows are withered.
Down it must, and to the fire
If desert have his due hire.
But spare it (Lord) another year,
With manuring it may bear.
If it then, be dead and dry,
Burn it, alas, what remedy.
Mine old foe assaults me sore,
With fire and water, more and more.
Poor I, of all my strength bereft,
Only unto thee am left.
That my foe may hence be chased,
And I from ruins claws released.
Lord vouchsafe me every day,
Strength to fast, and faith to pray.
These two means thy self have taught,
To bring temptations force to naught.
Lord free my soul from sins infection,
By repentances direction.
Be thy fear in me abiding
My soul to true salvation guiding
Grant me faith (Lord) hope and love
Zeal of heaven and things above
Tcach me prize the world at naught,
On thy bliss be all my thought.
All my hopes on thee I found,
In whom all good things abound.
Thou art all my dignity,
All I have I have from thee.
Thou art my comfort in distress,
Thou art my cure, in heaviness
Thou art my music in my sadness,
Thou art my medicine in my madness
Thou my freedom from my thrall,
Thou my rayser from my fall.
In my labor thou releiues me,
Thou reformes what ever grieves me.
All my wrongs thy hand reuengeth,
And from hurt my soul defends
Thou my deepest doubts reuealest,
Thou my secret faults concealest.
Oh do thou stay my feet from treading
In paths to hell and horror leading:
Where eternal torment dwells,
With fears, and tears and loathsome smells.
Where man's deepest shame is sounded,
And the guilty still confounded.
Where the scourge for ever beats,
And the worm that always eats.
Where all those endless do remain,
Lord preserve us from this pain.
In Syon lodge me (Lord) for pity
Syon David's kingly City.
Built by him that is only good,
Whose gates are of the crosses wood.
Whose keys are Christ's undoubted word,
Whose dwellers fear none but the Lord.
Whose walls are stone, strong, quick and bright,
Whose keeper is the Lord of light.
Here the light does never cease
Endless spring and endless peace
Here is music, heaven filling,
Swetnesse evermore distilling.
Here is neither spot nor taint,
No defect, nor no complaint.
No man crooked, great nor small,
But to Christ conformed all.
Blessed town, divinely graced,
On a rock so strongly placed.
Seated sure from fear of war:
I salute thy walls from far.
Thee I see, and thee I long for,
Thee I seek, and thee I groan for.
O what joy thy dwellers taste,
All in pleasures first and last?
What full enjoying bliss Divine?
What Jewels on thy walls do shine?
Rubie, Iacincth, Chalcedon,
Known to them within alone.
In this glorious Company
In the streets of Syon, I
With Job, Moses, and Eliah,
Will sing the heavenly Alleluiah
Amen.
A holy meditation of man's mi sery, and Gods mercy, together with a devout
prayer.
With longing cheer,
The thirsty Dear.
do seek the brook:
In such a kind,
The faithful mind,
For God does look.
And as the springs,
Refreshment brings,
in drought and sweat,
So God does cool,
The thirsty soul
in all her heat.
O Lord what floods
of glorious goods,
do thou bestow,
On those that be
thine, blessed is he
that well does know
Eternal bliss,
His guerdon is
that Jesus makes
His rest, but he
Reapes mysery
that him forsakes.
Thou make them glorious
And victorious,
Who serve thee well
In endless joy
From all annoy
with thee they dwell.
But oh Humanity,
With how great vanity,
art thou betost?
To dote in care,
On things that are,
so quickly lost?
Why do thou yield,
And leave the field,
to sins invasions?
Not well respecting,
But ill rejecting,
thy Gods persuasions?
Open thine eyes,
And well advise,
of whence thou art:
Thy life, thy birth,
Thy state, thy worth,
observe each part.
From carelessness
Thy self still bless,
O man Gods Jewel:
How he placed thee,
And graced thee
observe and view well.
To what intent,
Has God thee sent,
observe with care:
To whom (but pride
Drew thee aside)
thou had been heir.
O mortal son,
Affliction
is thy due hire:
That broke the band
Of Gods command,
through vain desire.
But oh take heed,
Those pains exceed,
that rule in hell:
Whose fire so cruel,
Has those for fuel,
that live not well.
The man that joys
In worldly toys,
his soul orethrowes:
Respecting naught,
What Christ has bought
full dear God knows.
Then never grudge,
If God thee judge,
his yoke to bear:
Let not lust draw,
Thee from his law,
But hold it dear.
And soon apply
His remedy,
unto thy sore:
Least it increase,
To worse disease,
and plague thee more.
Do not despair,
Thou may be heir,
with Christ in joy:
By casting out,
Corruptions root,
thy souls annoy.
Still fear thou must,
But not distrust,
and beg thy cure:
For errors weep,
Thy body keep
lowly and pure:
If to thy fear,
Thy judge appear
with angry face:
Know he will loose,
Not one of those,
that beg his grace.
Pray without rest,
And knock thy breast,
humble thy mind:
All that bewail,
Their errors frail,
have pardon signed.
And do not spare,
In hymme and prayer,
Jesus to praise:
For mercy still,
Is at his will,
at all assayes.
And when the devil,
The Prince of evil,
attempteth thee,
Then if thou pray
Christ will not stay
to set thee free.
All be thou were,
To death most near,
yet still be sure:
And understand
That his high hand,
contains thy cure.
Be he thy quest,
That gives all rest,
from restless woes:
Who so adore,
And him implore,
shall come to those,
For many an one,
Dead long agon,
has he revived:
And saved more
That were before
of grace deprived,
Be all thy love,
On God above,
Lift up thy spirit:
That thou may taste
The Saints repast,
through his sole merit.
And honor him,
That he from sin,
may thee deliver,
That sins increase
In thee may cease,
in prayer persevere.
On him I call,
That all in all
has in his power:
Against all harm,
Be he mine arm
my shield my tower.
And this lives length
Vouchsafe us strength
to keep his hest:
That at our end
We may ascend,
To endless rest.
Amen.
Here follows the means and manner how our forefathers in the time of Popery
prepared themselves and others to dye, consisting first of the confession of
their faith, and secondly of the prayers which were made by them, and for them
in their last sickness, by which it may appear that though they were misled
by the crafty Romish Clergy, in diverse errors and superstions, yet in the
great point of the means of salvation, they were of our religion and were
saved by it.

INterrogationes quae fieri debent morituris dum adhuc vsum rationis habent,
and loquendi, vt si quis minus dispositus fuerit ad moriendum, de meliori
informetur atque in eodem confortetur. Illae autem interrogationes debent
fieri, fecundum Anselmum Episcopum hoc modo,
Primos queratur sic.

Frater 1 laetaris quod in fide Christi morieris.

Ille respondet, Etiam.

Frater 2 penitet te non tam been vixisse sicut debuisses?

Respondeat etiam.

Frater, habes animum emendandi si spatium viuendi haberes?

Respon. Etiam.

Frater credis te non posse nisi per Christi mortem saluari?

Resp. Etiam.

Credis quod prote mortuus est Dominus Jesus Christus fillius Dei?

Resp. Etiam,

Agis ei gratias ex toto cord de hoc.

Respo. Etiam.

Age ergo ei (dum superest in te anima) semper gratias, and in hac sola morte,
fiduciam tuam constitue: in nulla alia re fiduciam habe, huic mortite totum
commit, hac sola te totum contege: totum immisce te in hac morte, totum
confige, in hac morte te totum inuolue.

Et si dominus Deus voluerit tu iudicare, dic, Domine, mortem Domini mei Jesus
Christi obijcio inter me and iudiciu^ tuum aliter tecum non contendam.

Et si tibi dixerit Deus, quia peccator es. dic, Domine mortem Domini mei Jesus
Christi pono inter te and peccata mea: si dixerit tibi quod meruisti
damnationem, dic: Domine, mortem Domini mei Jesus Christi obtendo inter te, and
mala merita mea, Ipsumque, and dignissimae, passionis meritum offero pro merito
quod ego debuissem habere, and (heu) hon habeo:

Si dixerit deus quod tibi est iratus, die, Domine mortem Domini mei Jesus
Christi pono inter me and iram tuam.

Deinde dicat ter, In manus tuas Domine commendo spiritum meum, et si id ipsum
non potest loqui dicat conuentus vel astantes, In manus tuas domine commendamus
spiritum eius.

Et securus moritur, nec videbit mortem in eternum.

Et in alio vetusto codice.
SEquntur signa sex quibus homo potest confidere de salute.

1 Si credit ea quae sunt Christianae fidei quantum ad omnia ab Ecclesia
determinata.

2 Si gaudet and laetetur quod in fide Christi morietur.

3 Si cognoscat se grauiter Deum offendisse.

4 Si dolet se tam grauiter Deum offendisse.

5 Si proponit a peccatis abstinere si vixerit.

6 Si credit and sperat venire ad salute^ aeternam non proprijs meritis, sed
Jesus Christi.

Et dicit Anselmus quod hae sex questiones proponi debent homini costituto in
mortis articulo, and addit.

Deinde dicatur infirmo: si Satan tibi obijciat aliquid, opponas merita
Christi inter te and ipsu^, and his peractis sine dubio saluabitur.

Ista consolatio and preparatio ad mortem, in vetustis codicibus ascribitur
Anselmo, qui vixit ante annos 500, in ipsa adulta fere aetate Papismi. Si vero
dubitaret quis, quomodo patres nostri in hisce posterioribus, multoque
peioribus temporibus salutem aeterna^ possent adipisci, grassante Papismo and
vigente potestate tenebrarum.

Respondeo eandem fere preparationem, and intterrogationes fuisse in vsu and
aestimatione, In densissimis Papismi tenebris: pessimo nimirum illo tempore
Concilij Constantiensis ante annos nimirum 200. sic enim reperio scriptum in
alio vetusto codice, multis abhinc annis descripto.

Omnis Christianus sieve secularis, five regularis modo subsequenti de sua
salute inquirendus et informandus est.
1 CRedis omnes principales articulos fidei, and insuper toti sacrae Scripturae
per omnia, secundum sanctorum Catholicorum and orthodoxorum, sanctae Ecclesiae
doctorum expositionem and detestatis omnes hereses and errores atque
superstitiones, ab Ecclesia reprobatas: ac laetaris insuper quod in fide
Christi, ac vnitate matris Eccelsiae, ac obedientia morieris?

2 Cognoscis te Creatorem tuum saepe and multipliciter, atque grauiter
offendisse.

3 Doles ex toto cord de omnibus peccatis contra Dei maiestatem amorem and
benignitatem, de malis commissis and bonis omissis, and gratias neglectis, non
solum timore mortis conturbatus, vel paenae cuiuscu^que sed magis ex amore Dei?

4 Petis frater omnibus istis veniam a Jesus Christo, optans per illum cor tuum
illuminari ad cognitionem obliquorum, vt de illis valeas specialiter paenitere?

5 Proponis te vereaciter velle eme^dare si supervixeris, et nunqua^ plus
mortaliter peccare scienter, sed potius omnia quanticunque chara dimittere imo
etiam vitam carnalem perdere antequam Deum plus velles offendere.

6 Rogas insuper Deum vt det tibi gratiam hoc propositum continuandi and non
recidiuandi.

7 Indulges, ex toto cord, omnibus qui vnquam aliquid nocumentum verbo, vel
facto tibi intulerunt, vel aliquo modo offenderunt, ob amorem and venerationem
Domini tui Jesus Christi, a quo and tu veniam speras* Petis etiam fideliter
indulgeri and remitti tibi ab ijs quos tu offendisti quouis modo?

8 Vis ablata restitui integraliter in quantu^ teneris iuxta tuarum facultatum
valorem etiam vsque ad omnium bonorum tuorum c^ssionem inclusiue, vbi alias,
satisfactio fieri non valeret?

9 Credis quod part mortuus sit Christus and quod aliter saluari non potes,
nisi per meritum passionis Domini nostri Jesus Christi: and agis etiam de hoc
Deo gratias ex cord, quantum valeas.

Quicunque autem ad praedictas interrogationes ex conscientia bona, and fide
non ficta, vere poterit affirmative respondere, satis euidens argumentum
salutis habet, si sic decesserit, quod de numero saluandorum erit.

QVestions to be propounded to sick persons, whilst they have the use of
reason, and power to speak, to the end that if any be not so well disposed to
dye, he may be better informed and prepared. And the questions be these,
according to Anselme the reverend Bishop.

1 Let him be asked thus,

Brother do thou rejoice that thou shall dye in the faith of Christ?

Ans. I do.

2 Brother, do thou sorrow and grieve, for that thou have not lived so well
as thou ought?

The answer, I do

Brother: have thou a hearty purpose to live better, if God give thee time to
live?

Ans. I have.

Brother do thou believe that thou cannot be saved, but by the death of
Christ?

Ans. I do.

Do thou believe that Jesus Christ the Son of God dyed for thee?

Ans. I do.

Do thou give thanks to God therefore from thy whole heart?

Ans. I do.

Well then good brother, whilst thy soul is yet in thy body give him hearty
thanks* and settle all thy assurance upon his death alone: have no confidence
in any thing else: trust thy self wholly to his passion: cover thy self
wholly with it, fasten thy whole self on his cross: cast thy whole self into
this sea.

And if thy Lord God say he will judge thee; answer thou, Lord I object the
death of my Lord Jesus Christ betwixt me and thy judgment, otherwise I will
not contend with thee.

And if God say to thee thou art a sinner, answer: Lord it is so, but I set the
death of my Lord Jesus Christ betwixt thee and my sins: If he say that thou
have deserved damnation, answer. It is true Lord, but I place the death and
merits of my Lord Jesus Christ betwixt thee and my ill deseruings: and I offer
up him and the most worthy merits of his passion, for the merits which I
should have had, but (alas) have not.

If the Lord say further that he is angry with thee, answer him, Lord thou
have cause, but I set the death and sufferings of my Lord Jesus Christ, betwixt
thy wrath and my soul.

Then let him say thrice: Lord into thy hands I commend my spirit. And if he be
so weak he cannot, then let the company who stand by say, Lord into thy hands
we commend his soul.

He that does thus is safe and secure, for, he shall never taste of eternal
death.

Also in another old book I find this written.
THese be the six signs upon which a man may rest confident of his salvation.

1 If he believe the Articles of Christian faith, as many as are determined by
the Church.

2 If he rejoice to dye in the faith of Christ.

3 If he know that he has grievously offended God.

4 If he be heartily sorry for it.

5 If he resolve to forsake his sins, if God give him life.

6 If he hope and believe to come to eternal salvation, not by his own
merits, but by the merits of Jesus Christ.

And Anselme says that these six questions are to be asked of every one at
the time of his death, and says further thus.

Then say to the sick person: if Satan object any thing against thee, oppose
thou the merits of Christ betwixt thee and him: and thus without all doubt he
shall be saved.

This consolation of the sick and preparation to their death is in ancient
Copies ascribed to Anselme, who lived more then 500 years ago, even when
Popery was almost grown to perfect age: Now if any man make question how our
fathers were saved in these later and worse times, when Popery prevailed in a
greater measure; I answer that even almost the same preparation, and same
questions, were used long after Anselme, even in the deepest darkness of
Popery: For in the most evil time about the Council of Constance, some two
hundred years ago, Thus I find it written in ancient Book, and it is ascribed
to Gerson.

Every Christian whether secular or regular is thus to be examined and informed
in his sickness touching his salvation.
1 Do thou believe all the principal articles of faith, and all that is
contained in the whole body of holy Scripture, according to the exposition of
the Catholic and orthodoxall Doctors of the holy Church: and do thou detest
all heresies and errors and superstitions, condemned or reproved by the
Church: and art thou glad that thou dyest in the faith of Christ, and unity and
obedience of thy Mother the Church.

2 Do thou know and confess that thou have many ways and grievously
offended thy God and Creator.

3 Do thou sorrow from thy whole heart for all thy sins committed against
Gods Majesty his love and mercy, art thou truly sorrowful for the evils that
thou have committed, and the good that thou have omitted, and the grace thou
have neglected, and art thou agreiued, not so much for fear of death, or any
punishment, as for that love which thou ought to bear toward God?

4 Do thou beg pardon for all these thy sins of Jesus Christ, desiring that
by him thy heart may be enlightened, truly to see and know thy sins, that so
thou may particularly and more seriously repent of them?

5 Do thou propound and resolve truly to amend thy life (if so be thou live)
and never hereafter to sin so again, but rather to loose any thing how dear
soever unto thee, yea even life it self, then to offend thy God again?

6 Do thou also desire of God, grace to continue in this purpose, that thou
may not fall again?

7 Do thou forgive from thy whole heart all that have done thee any wrong in
word or deed, for the love of Christ Jesus thy Lord and Savior, and as thou
hopest for pardon from him: and do thou heartily desire to be forgiven of
all men, whom thou have any way offended?

8 Will thou that there be full restitution made according to thy power, yea
though it should extend to thy whole estate, if otherwise there cannot be
satisfaction made?

9 Do thou believe that Christ dyed for thee, and that thou can be saved
no otherwise but by the merits of Jesus Christ: and do thou give God
thanks for this from thy whole heart as much as thou art able.

And whosoever can give true answer to these questions affirmatively, out of a
good conscience and faith not feigned; It is an evident and sufficient testimony
of salvation, and let him not doubt but if he so depart, he is one of them
that shall be saved.

Behold here good Reader our Religion practiced in the most misty times of
Popery: behold here the true, holy, Catholic and ancient way to heaven:
Namely, By Christ and his merits alone. Here is no trusting on man's merits,
either our own or others: Here is no mention of Agnus deis, or Wodden
Crucifixes, He is not bid to trust in the prayers, suffrages, requiems, dirges,
Masses, Trentals, or other obsequies that shall be said for him after his
departure. He is sent to no Angel, no nor to the Virgin Mary, for matter of
Salvation: Nay all are excluded, and Christ's death alone, even it alone, is
made the means of his Salvation, And the makers hereof were so resolute, and
zealous in this point, that they use such variety of words, as though they
could not sufficiently express the excellency and the nececessity of cleaving
to Christ alone in the matter of salvation.

And if any man suspect that this is but devised by us, and falsely fathered
upon Antiquity, let him know that not only we have the ancient Copies, whose
age will speak for themselves, but even the better sort of Papists, that be
learned, do know this well enough.

A learned Papist of this age Gasper vlenbergius. in lib. de Causis. Causa 14.
page 462. editionis Colon. 1589.
writes, that in a Church in Colaine this very book is extant (Manuscript)
and that he has seen it, and that this manner of comforting the sick was
used in former ages, and confesses that it contains the very treasure and
kernel of Christian Religion, and says further that this manner was used not
in Germany only, but over all the Christian world: Indeed to the Jesuits I
confess, this is held a ridiculous manner of comforting the sick, (such a
spirit possesses them:) Thus does Gretzer their Champion, flout us Lutherans (
as he calls us) for thus doing.

The Lutherans (says he) do Iae. Gretzerus in refutat Leyseri de histor. Ord.
Jesuit.
thus comfort their sick. Relics, Crucifixes, Agnus deis, and such matters are
but dead things, and nothing worth, the Scripture has not a word of them: it
is therefore very ungodly to trust in them; but God is our hope, and God is our
strength trust in him, etc. On this wise fashion do these godly comforters
comfort their sick persons.

Thus in the Jesuits judgment it is but a seely course to trust in Gods
mercy, and Christ's merits, in points of salvation: Hereby it may be discerned
of what spirit they are. But let them mock us, as long as with us they mock
the Scriptures, Antiquity, and the better sort of their own side, for we
appeal to this that has been said, whether this manner of comforting the
sick were not in use long before Luther was borne:

Now if any object that in the same books there is mention of the Crucifixe,
and that it is appointed to be in the presence of the sick person: I answer
it is true, but not that he should worship it, (as now the Jesuits teach, and
all the approved Gregori. de valent. Gretzerus, Vasquez.
Romish writers) but that it may put him in mind of Christ, which though it be
a needless superstition, yet is it not that impiety and idolatry, which now
at this day is practiced and maintained in the Romish Church, and my purpose is
not to discharge those times, nor our forefathers in those times of errors,
and superstitions, but of the idolatry, impiety, and blasphemy of the present
Church of Rome. And the same answer is also to be given to another objection.
That in the same book there are prayers to the Saints and Angels: It is so,
and from that error those ages cannot be cleared: but with all let us still
observe that those prayers are not to help them in matters of salvation, (as
are many blasphemous prayers now usual in Popery:) and that sin in those
mistie times (being a sin of ignorance) no doubt was pardoned unto them in
the mercy of God, seeing that for their reconciliation with God, and eternal
salvation, they believed to attain it only by the merits and passion of Jesus
Christ. But let not us feed on their infirmities, but lovingly pass by them,
and let this content and comfort us, that their means of salvation which they
used and trusted unto, is the same with ours at this day: for better testimony
whereof, let us set down some of their prayers, being such as the best
Christian may use at this day with much comfort.

Certain Prayers used by our Forefathers in the darkest times of Popery, in
the time of a man's sickness: some to be made for the sick, and some by the
sick person: gathered out of the same ancient books. When the sick person
feels his strength to fail, then let him commend his soul to God in this
Prayer.
O summa Deitas, immensa, clementissima, atque gloriosissima Trinitas, summa
dilectio, amor and charitas, miserere mei miserrimi peccatoris: tibi enim
commendo spiritum meum. Deus meus pijssimus, pater miserecordiarum,
miserecordiam fac huic pauperculae Creaturae, and in vltima necessitate mea
succurreiam Domine indigenti animae, and desolatae, vt non a canibus
infernalibus deuoretur.

O dulcissime, and amantissime Domine Jesus Christi, fili Dei viui, ob honorem,
and virtutem beatissimae passionis, iube me recepi inter numerum electorum
tuorum:

Saluator and Redemptor meus, reddo me totu^ tibi: vt me non renuas a venia,
nec repellas a gloria tua. At o Domine Jesus Christ, paradisum tuum postulo,
non ob valorem meritorum meoru^, cum sum puluis and cinis, and peccator
miserrimus sed in virtute and efficacia, tuae sanctissimae passionis, per quam
me miserimu^ redimere voluisti, and mihi paradisum tuo pretioso sanguine emere
dignatus es. Igitur per illam amaritudinem quam pro me sustinere voluisti in
Cruce, maxim in illa hora quando sanctissima anima tua egressa est de corpore
tuo, miserere animae meae in egressu suo.

Deinde dicat pluries diripuisti Domine vincula mea, tibi sacrificabo hostiam
laudis.

Deinde cum ipse visum loquelae amiserit, orationes sequentes dicantur super
infirmum laborantem ab aliquo presentium, si adhuc superuiuit.
QVaesumus, miserecors pater, secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarum,
respice propitius super hunc famulu^ tuum, fratrem nostrum, remissionem omnium
peccatorum suorum tota cordis confessione poscentem: Exaudi deprecantes, and
renoua in eo, pijssime pater, quicquid in eo terrena fragilitate corruptum est,
vel quicquid Diabolica fraud violatum est, and vnitati corporis Ecclesiae
membrum redemptionis congrega. Miserere Domine gemituu^ suorum, miserere
lachrimarum eius, and in habentem fiduciam nisi in miserecordia tua ad tuae
reconciliationis sacrameutum admit. In manus igitur in extinguibilis
miserecordiae tuae, pater sanctissime, co^mendemus spiritum famuli tui fratris
nostri, secundu^ magnitudinem amoris quo se anima filij tui sanctissima in
cruce tibi co^mendabit supplicater deprecantes quatenus per illa^ inestimabile^
diuinitate^ quam tua diuina bonitas in se tota^ traxit illam sanctissiman
animam, vt in hora vltima famuli tui, fratris nostri, suscipias in eodem amore
spiritum eius.

Et tu dulcissime redemptor, pijssime Jesus, per illam lacrimabilem vocem quam
moriturus emisisti, cum pro nobis doloribus and laboribus passionis adeo
consumptus es, vt te derelictum a patre clamabas. Ne long facias a famule tuo,
fratre nostro, auxilium tuae miserationis in hora and in momento afflictionis
animae suae prae defectione and consumptione spirit us te inuocare in extrema
hora mortis scire non valente: sed per triumphum sanctae crucis and per salutem
salutiferae passionis and amorosae mortis tuae, cogitade eo cogitationes pacis,
and no^ afflictonis sed miserecordissimae miserationis and co^solationis: and
libera eam de omnibus angustijs, erue eam a a tormentis sibi deputatis and
perduc eam in requie^ aeternum: O Domine Jesus Christ, qui redemisti nos
precioso sanguine tuo, scribe in anima huius famuli tui vulnera tua pretioso
sanguine tuo, vt discat in eis legere tuum dolorem and tuum amorem: dolorem
contra omnes dolores and paenas quas pro peccatis suis se timet meruisse:
Amorem vt vniatur tibi amore inuisibili, quo a te and omnibus electis tuis,
nunquam possit in aeternum seperari:

Et fac cum Domine Jesus Christ's participem sacratissimae incarnationis
passionis, resurrectionis and ascentionis tuae: fac eum participem
sacratissimoru^ mysteriorum and sacramentorum tuorum: Fac eam participem omnium
orationum ac benefactorum quae fuerunt in Ecclesia sancta tua. Fac eam
participem omnium benedictionum, gratiarum, and gaudiorum ominum electorum
tuorum, ab initio mundi, and concede vt cum his omnibus in tuo conspectu
gaudeat in aeternum: Domine qui orasti pro nobis in monte Oliueti, obsecramus
te vt multitudine^ sanguinis et sudoris quem prae angustia tua copiosissime pro
nobis effudisti, ostendere digneris and offerre deo patri omnipotenti contra
multitudinem omnium peccatorum huius famuli tui fratris nostri, and libera cum
in hac hora mortis suae ab omnibus paenis and angustijs quas pro peccatis fuis
timet se meruisse; salua animam eius in hac hora exitus sui, et aperi ei Ianuam
vitae, and fact eam gaudere cum sanctis in gloria aeterna, per tua merita
Domine Jesus Christ, qui cum Deo patre, and spiritu Sancto viuis and reg-Deus
in secula.

Cum autem eius vires deficient and animam emissurum videatur, commendetur
anima per aliquem astantium, hoc modo.

Commendatio animae morientis.
COmmendo te omnipotenti Deo (charissime frater) et ei, cuius es creatura
committo: proficiscere anima Christiana de hoc misero mundo. In nomine Patris
omnipotentis qui te creauit. In nomine Jesus Christi filij eius qui pro te
passus est. In nomine Spiritus Sancti, qul in te fusus est. Egrediente aute
animatua de corpore, splendidus Angelorum caetus tibi occurrat, and omnium
sanctorum caetus te accipiat: appareat tibi mitis, and clemens, Jesus Christus,
qui inter assistentes sibi te iugiter interesse decernat, vt locus tuus in pace
sit, and habitatio tua in Jerusalem coelesti: Ignores omnino quid horret in
tenebris, quid stridet in flammis, quid cruciat in tormentis. Cedat tibi
nequissimus Satan cum satellitibus suis: nec in aduentu suo te vincat,
sedcoram angelis dei contremiscat as in aterna noctis chaos immane diffugiat:
at exurget Deus and dissipentur omnes inimici eius, sicut deficit fumus ita
deficiant. Iusti autem exultentur, and exultent in conspectu Dei: Confundantur
igitur and erubescant ante te tar tareae legiones and ministri satanae iter
tuum impedire non audea^t: Liberet te a cruciatu Christus qui pro te mori
dignatus est, and constituet te Christus filius Dei inter paradisi sui amena
and semper virentia, and i am inter oues suos verus te ille pastor agnoscat.
Ille ab omnibus peccatis tuis absoluat, atque ad dextram in electorum suorum
sort te constituat, vt redemptorem tuum facie ad faciam videas and co^stitutum
agmina beatorum contemplationis diuinae gaudio potiaris in secula saeculonum.

Amen.

the time of a man's sickness: some to be made for the sick, and some by the

Prayer.
O Most high and sovereign God whose goodness and mercy is infinite: o most
glorious Trinity, which art love, and mercy, and goodness it self, have
mercy on me most miserable sinner, for unto thee, and unto thy hands I commend
my spirit: o Lord, my most loving God, and father of mercies, show thy mercy on
me thy poor creature, and forsake me not in my last need, but stand with me
Lord, and help my succourlesse soul, save my poor and desolate soul, that
it be not devoured of the infernal dogs.

O most loving Lord, and sweet Savior Jesus Christ, the son of the living
God, I beseech thee for the honor, and by the virtue of thy most blessed
passion command that I may be received into the number of thy Saints, and
servants.

O my Savior and my Redeemer I here yield up my self wholly to thee, O grant
me thy grace and thy glory, vochsafe me pardon of my sin, and give me a
portion of thy glory. But o my dear Lord, I challenge not a place in heaven for
any worthiness of my own merits, for I am but dust and ashes, and a most
wretched finner: but for the virtue of thy most blessed passion, by which thou
did vouchsafe to redeem me miserable man, and to purchase heaven for me,
even with the price of thy precious blood. I beseech thee therefore by thy most
blessed, and bitter passion, which thou sustainedst on the Cross for me,
especially in that hour when thy blessed soul did leave the body, that thou
would have mercy on my poor soul at the time of my departure.

Then let him lift up his heart with joy and thanksgiving, and say, Lord thou
have broken my bonds, therefore I will offer to thee the sacrifice of praise.

After, if his weakness grow so that he loose the use of his speech, let some
of the bystanders say these prayers following over him, or more if he live so
long.
Merciful God and Father we beseech thee for the multitudes of thy mercies,
look favorably upon this thy servant (our dear brother) who with true and
hearty confession seeks pardon of all his sins at the hand of thy mercies, O
Lord hear us for him, and we beseech thee for him, most holy father, to renew
in his heart what ever is corrupted by the frailty of his flesh, and restore
that grace which the wily and malicious enemy the devil has stolen out of his
soul: O Lord recall him to the unity of thy Church; ingraft him into the body
of thy soul. O Lord take pity of the sighs and sobbes of his soul, and
groans of his heart, o Lord look upon his tears, gather them in thy bottle,
and be good to him, who has no hope, comfort nor confidence, but in thy mercy,
and seal up the assurance of his reconciliation with thee. O most holy Father
we humbly commend the soul of this thy servant, and our brother into the hands
of thy unmeasureable mercies, humbly beseeching thee, according to the
greatness of that love in which the blessed soul of thy son did commend it
self into thy holy hands, that for the worthiness of that infinite love of
thine, in which thou did receive that holy soul unto thy self, thou would
vouchsafe in this our brothers last hour, to receive his poor soul also and
make it partaker of the same love.

And thou most sweet Savior and most merciful Lord Jesus, thou that dying on
the cross was so pressed with anguish and torments for us, as made thee sound
out that pitiful voice unto thy Father: My God, my God, why have thou forsaken
me, we beseech thee estrange not thy self, and turn not away thy face from
thy servant our brother, now in the hour of his souls affliction, when his
strength fails, and his spirits are so spent that he cannot call upon theee:
hear us O Lord: hear us for him, and for that thy glorious victory in which
thou did triumph on the cross, and for thy precious passion and bitter death
think of him the thoughts of mercy and not of justice: shed thy mercies in his
soul and speak co^fortably to his conscience, deliver his soul out of all
spiritual distress, save him from the torments due unto his deseruings, and
bring him, for thy own merits sake, to eternal rest. O Lod Jesus Christ which
did redeem us with thy precious blood, write with thine own blood, in the
soul, and ingraue thy wounds in the heart of this thy servant, that in the^ he
may see and read thy doleful sufferings and thy sweet love: thy sufferings that
they may be effectual to rasome him from those sorrows and torments which he
has merited by his sins: thy love that it may unite his heart to thee, in
invisible and inseparable bonds, so as he may never be separated from, thee nor
thy Saints, for ever and ever.

And Lord Jesus Christ we beseech thee make his soul partaker of all the
merits of thy most sacred incarnation, passion, resurrection, and ascension.
Make him pertaker of the virtue of thy most blessed sacraments, and all thy
holy mysteries. Make him pertaker of all the prayers and good deeds done in
thy whole Church. Make him pertaker of all the blessings, graces, and comforts
of all thy elect, and grant that with them all he may live in thy presence for
evermore. O Lord which powered out thy prayer for us on the mount Oliuet, and
sweat water and blood, we beseech thee, let that precious blood of thine,
which thou did so abundantly pour out for our salvation, let it be
presented and offered to thy father to stand against the multitude of of the
sins of this thy servant, our brother: Lord be with him at his last hour,
and then deliver him from the anguish and torments which for his sins he may
justly fear: Graciously receive his soul in the hour of his departure: open
the gate of heaven unto him, and give him a portion with thy Saints in glory,
for thy own most glorious merit, O Lord Jesus Christ, who with God the
Father, and the holy Ghost, live and raignest one God for evermore, Amen.

And when the sick man's strength begins to fail, and the soul is ready to
depart: then let the soul be commended to God by one of the bystanders on
this manner.

The Commendation of the soul to be said at a man's death.
I Here commend thee to Almighty God most dear brother, and I commit thee to
him whose creature thou art. Go forth therefore O Christian soul, get thee
gone out of this filthy world, go forth in the name of the Almighty Father who
created thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, who dyed for thee, in the name of
the holy Ghost who has been poured out upon thee: And when thou (happy soul)
art delivered out of the prison of the body, the glorious quire of heavenly
Angels meet thee, and the company of all holy Saints entertain thee: the
loving countenance and cheereful face of Jesus Christ shine upon thee, a
merciful Judge be he unto thee, that thou may have sentence to sit for
ever amongst his Saints, on his right hand: thy dwellings be in peace, and thy
salvation in the heavenly Jerusalem for evermore, far be it from thee ever to
feel or know how horrible the darkness, how terrible the flames, and how
intolerable the torments of hell are, Satan and all his hellish guard be they
confounded at thy presence, and if he dare set upon thee, victory and triumph
be on thy side, shame and trembling fall upon him from the presence of Gods
Angels, and be he banished into the black mists, and confused chaos of
eternal darkness. But let the Lord arise and let his enemies be scattered,
and as the smoke vanishes, so let them fly away. But let the just be exalted
and rejoice in the presence of the Lord: let the infernal legions not dare to
touch theee, nor all Satan's helhounds presume to hinder thee, and he who
disdained not to dye for thee, be he thy Savior and deliverer from all
spiritual vexation. Be the gates of paradise open unto thee, and thy Christ
give thee thy place and mansion in the same. And he that is the true Pastor,
and great Sheepeheard of the Sheep acknowledge thee for one of his true
Sheep, and receive thee into his fold, Jesus Christ absolve thee from all thy
sins, and place thee on his right hand among his elect, that there thou may
see thy Redeemer face to face, and in the society of blessed sed souls may
enjoy the comforts of heavenly co^templation, and the blessed vision of God,
for ever and ever.

Amen.
To the Reader.
SEe, Christian brother, how in the worst times they were prepared to die, and
commended to God: if the ancient books did not proclaim this truth, some would
not believe but that they had been made in this latter time. But seeing the
truth cannot be denied, I desire thee with me to observe these few collections
arising out of due consideration of the premises.

1. Here is answer to that great question, how our forefathers were saved,
even by the same faith as we are at this day.

2. How truly Christ performed his promise, namely, that the gates of hell
should not prevail against the true faith, for so we see that in the vilest
times this Faith has been preserved.

3. Observe how here is no touch, nor once mention of Purgatory, nor of any
thing to be done for their good after this life.

4. Here is no relation to any pardons or indulgences from the Pope.

5. Here is no necessity laid down of sending for a Priest to bring his Host,
and his Pix, and his holy water, and his Taper: These matters, it seems, are
rather commanded and pressed upon the people by the Romish Clergy* then much
regarded by the wiser, and godlier sort of our forefathers: neither are they
commanded to stay till the Priest come, but (says the book) let these prayers
be said, and the Commendation of his soul, by one of the bystanders.

Lastly, let it be observed, that in all these prayers and commendations, and
questions (and these says the book are all that be of necessity to be said)
here is not one smack of Popish idolarry, or superstition.

In these respects I have thought it no needless labor to communicate these
to thee (dear brother,) I know there be store of godly prayers and meditations
already extant. But these are of a special use more then others and are
venerable for their antiquity. And are to be the more welcome, because God
preserved the^ in the hands of our very enemies. And though they were mingled
with other things not so good, yet Hieronym. ad Laetum. Grandis prudentiae est
aurum in luto quaerere.
let us know as S. Hierome tells us, that it is no small point of wisdom, to
seek out gold out of mire and clay.

Make use of these, and help me with thy prayers, and thou shall shortly (if
God permit) be pertaker of more.
