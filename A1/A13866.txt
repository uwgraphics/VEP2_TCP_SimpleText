An Exposition of the.4. chap. of. S. Ioans Revelation made by Bar. Traheron in
sondrie Readinges before his country men in Germany. Where in the providence
of God is treated with an answer made to the objections of a gentle adversary.

Imprinted Anno. 1557.

To master To. Parker / and to maistres Anne his godly wife / exiles for
Christ's cause / Bar. Traheron wishes increase of gods grace.
While I labored to conforte my self / and other in the consideration of
gods providence / you know how one put in his foot / and assaied to impugn /
some part of that / that I had spoken. And though by your procureme^t we met
together / and after some debatinge agreed upon the chief points / that
before seemed to be in controversy between us / yet afterward it liked him to
show certain reasons against my affirmation / either for exercise of lerninge /
or bicaufe he would be better confirmed in the truth. Now consideringe that the
matter is of great weight / and importance / and somewhat scrupulous in this
weakness of men's capacitee / and su^^^c^e to the reprehensions / and
cauillatio^s of licen^ious heddes / lest any thing should be bruted otherwise
tha^ I spoke / I have thought good to put in pri^te all that I said in your
presence / that al men may know / what my meaning is / not by rehearsal
sermons / but by mine own writi^ge. And in this behalf I have partly followed
the counsel of M. Gilbert Barkley / who^ you know I have in due reverence / for
his great grauite / and singular integrite of life. This poor fruit of my
studies I dedicate unto you my most entierly biloued master Parker / and to the
right worthy matrone your wife. For sei^ge the perfect sincere love / that
should be between al married folk / shines most notably in you / I would not
sondre you in this place / whom god has so ioigned / and made one in all good
things. I have judged it also my duty for as much as the bowels of the
sai^ctes have be^ / and be daily refreshed by you / to render this testimony
of your singular godliness / and of my good affection toward you / in the
sight of the world. God almighty confirm / and augmente in you the knowledge
of his truth / and love of righteousness / and bless my biloued / We^tworth /
Peregrine / Anne / and Cecile your children / that they may follow the godly
steps of their Parents / and that the mention that I make of the^ in this
place / ^^ie be a spur unto them here after to set them forewarde in the love
of true religion / and innocentie of life.

Amen.
THE FIRST READINGE.
As THE vision which Ezechiel saw / and describes in the.1. cha. serves to
this end / to teach that the great miseries / and calamities / which the Iues
suffered by the force / and oppression of Nabuchodonosor / and the Babilonians /
came not upon them by chance / but by the ordinance / and providence of God /
so this vision / which. S. Joan most lively sets before us / shows in like
manner / that the decaie / and ruin the afflictions / and persequutions of the
church in this later time / and what so ever is don in the world b^ Antichrist
/ and his members / is not tossed at adventure by hap / but governed by the hand
/ and certain providence of God. And it is right necessary for us to know /
that fortune and chance rule nor the roast in men's matters / rufflinge and
tombling^ al things confusedly / as Epicures disciples thin^ke / but that god
is the orderer / disposer / and goue^ner of all the things that be don in the
world. For it is not possible for us to quiet our selves / when we considre
the long / and great prosperitee / and lu^kie success of false teachers / of
Christ's open / and professed enemies / of most ungodly cruel / barbarous /
and wicked men / onles we be stayed with this / tha^ god rules / ordreth / and
governs al together / S^ therefore that there shall be an end of the raginge
o^ tyrannous persequutors / and that the gouerner of al / shall turn al to the
just destruction / of the wicked to the conforte of his chosen / and to the
adua^ceme^t of his own glory. Again if we look upon our private state / and
call to compte our frailty, and infirmity / the manifold diseases / and
miseries whereu^to wear subject / what comfort ca^ we have / or what end of
morninge and sorrow / if we be not persuaded / that Gods prouid^ce reaches
unto us / and ordreth all that comes upon us / not as seems unto us / but as
he knows to be best for us.

But here I must warn you of two notable fautes. One is of the^ / which when
they hear us say / that al things comme to pass / by gods providence /
think / and affirm that we teach / that god is the author of all the sinful
acts / that are don in the world. Which is most false / most horrible / and
detestable / ^ther to be spoken / or thought. For it is as impossible for god /
who is al together good / to be the author of evil / as it is impossible for him
/ to leave of his godhead / and to be no more god. We say than constantly /
and with all vehementie of mind / that God is the outer of no evil / and we
mean it not so / that because god worcketh it / therefore it is good / though
of it self it be evil / but we mean / that he is in deed the propre worcker /
and cause of no evil / that evil / and sin spring not from him / but from
the devil / and from us / and that he is simply / and merely the author / and
worcker of good things only / both when he worcketh by him self / and when he
worcketh ^y and in us. And yet we say that nothing comes to pass without
him / and that he ordreth / disposes / te^pere^h / and brings forth to light
/ all the evil acts that are do^ in the world. But it is one thing to vttre /
to bring forth / to dispose / and order men's evils / and it is another
thing to work / and to cause evils in men.

It is one thing to make an instrument evil / and it is another thing to use
an evil instrument / being already so made by another. To make an instrument
evil / is evil / to use an evil instrument / is not evil simply / yea to use an
evil instrument to good ends / is good. Satan / and our own will / has made
us al evil instruments. God though we be now made il instruments / uses us
well. Satan / and our own will has wrought / and caused wick^dnes in us al. God
moderateth / represseth / stirs up / and brings forth the evil / that
Satan / and we have caused in our selves / so that we vttre no part of the
evil that is in us / by Satan's envy / and our own fault and folly / but
where and when it pleases god the governor of the universal world. And thus I
trust, it is not hard to perceive, that though nothing comme to pass besides
Gods providence / yet he is not the author / and worcker / and very cause of
any manner of evil / and sinful act. For he worcketh not evil in our hertes /
but findinge evil there already wrought / he either stops / and represseth
the same / or stirs it up / and brings it forth / and makes it known to
the world / as he knows to make most for his glory / and for the profit of
his chosen.

The Other fault is of them / which acknowledge God to be the ruler / and gouerner
of al things / and yet they find fault in his government. For they ask /
why God provided not other wise in the beginning / than that Satan should
bring man to transgression / why he stopped not his enterprise at the first /
for so should there have been no evil in the world or why now he does not
destroy al wicked men / all the adversaries of his son at once / or make them
al good men that we might live a quiet / happy / and pleasant life without
misery / without murmuringe / without filthiness of manners in all purity / and
godliness / where as now the world is full of calamities / full of pleges / full of
vile acts / full of false doctrine / idolatry / and superstition / antichriste
preuaili^ge every where / making havoc / beatinge down / and sta^pinge
under his fete all that is good / and godly. These men would have God / and his
doings subject to their judgments seat / and what so ever they cannot
comprehe^de with their wits / they can find no reason nor goodness in it. They
will not make their judgments agree to Gods doings / but they will have God
to make his doings agree to their judgments. But what if God will not do them
that honor / until they can show them selves / as wise / as he is.

Shall a co^ninge artificer alter his work / because a folish unskillful man /
ca^ seem to himself to find a fault in it. No man in this life can attain to
a full reason of Gods doings. But we shall see in this part off the scripture
/ that they which are now departed out of this life / and live in a better life
/ find that God has don al things most wisely / justly / and ordredly /
whereunto they cold not fully attain / while they lived in this world. But
though I say / that men in this life can not attain to a full knowledge / and
reason of al gods doings / yet I deny not / but that they have some
knowledge / and se some reason in his doings. For touching the first question
/ if god had hindered Satan's entreprise / at the beginning / tha^ Satan's
wickedness / and man's frailty / than gods righteousness in punishinge sin
/ and his most wonderful goodness in the long purposed before / and now
perfirmed incarnation of his son / cold never have been known. And touching
the second question / that he now suffers Antichrist to make such an hurley
burley / and confusion in the world / therein his wisdom / and righteousness
appears plainly / in bringing to light the outrageous nawghtines of men / and
in strikinge the reprobate with deserved blindness. His mercy also and goodness
shines forth / most clearly in saving / and pr^seruing his chosen / in the
midst of al errors / and blindness / in in the midst of al stomblinge
blocks / and dangers, which is no less to be meruailed at / tha^ the saui^ge
of the noble children of the Hebru^s unhurt / in the hot burninge oven. But
now that I have showed you the end of this vision, with some aunsweres to the
objections of me^ / either ungodly or unlearned / I will breifely show you the
su^me / and so comme to a more particular consideration of the text. This is
the vision in sum. In heaven there appears a throne of imperial majesty.
Upon this throne there sits one holdinge a book in his right hand sealed
with.7. seals. A lamb as it were slain / is associated / and ioigned with
him / that sits upon the throne / which receueth the book / and opens the
seals thereof. Out of this throne there proceeds a seuenfolde spirit / which
shows forth his wondreful power. Before the throne there is a glassie sea
clear / and chrystalline. The throne leans upon.4. beasts / which have eyes
/ and wings. Then a grene rainebow like an emrode co^passeth the throne / as
it were a garlande. In a circle about the throne be.24. seats / and in them
sit 24. elders crouned / and clothed in white garments. This is the sum of
the vision / which requires a more particular declaration. But first we must
speak some what of those things / which S. Joan sets before this vision /
which he so co^ningly painteth forth. Thus he speaks before.

AFTER these things I saw) S. Io. saw other visions before / declaringe to him
/ how the Lord Jesus reigns in his church / and governs it / what
precepts / what exhortations / what chastisementes he uses in it / and again
what the duty of the church is toward her lord / and king. Al which things
ar discribed in in the former chapitres.

I saw) That is a vision appeared unto me.

AND behold a door was opened in heaven) Where a door stands open / men may
enter in. So by this speech. S. Io. signifies / that he was admitted in to the
contemplation of heaue^lie things. Wherein the great goodness of God is set
before us / who vouchsafes to open the door of his secret closette to a
mortal man. But see the same goodness yet more declared. For many see a Kings
privy chamber door open / and yet ar aferd to enter in. Such fear and
bashefulnes might happen to. S. Joan / and therefore God conforteth him / and
makes him bold. For he says.

AND the first voice that I heard was as it had been of a tro^pe speaking with
me / and saiynge / comme up hither) Henry Bullinger a very godly / and
learned man / thinks that this voice / was the voice of Christ / which I like
well. If you will take it rather for the voice of an angel / I will not co^tende
therein / so that you vndrestand / that the angel spoke unto Io. after this
sort / by the appointement of Christ. For whether the lord show his goodness to
us by himself / or by his creatures / it is al one. Al proceeds from him /
and therefore he is only to be glorified. The voice was like the sound of a
trompe / whereby is signified that it was no fainte thing / but mighty in
worcking / and able to take away al fear / and to persuade thoroughly.

COMME up hither) The nature of earth is / to fall to the earth / and not to rise
upward.

We should never rise from the earth / onles God did call us / and raise us up.
But if we will considre god / and his worckes / we must ascend / we must fly
up far above the earth / far above our flesh / and our own reason to. That
Bullinger says that we must purge our selves from erthie affections / if we
will behold heavenly things / it is a very good sense also.

AND j will show the what shall be don here after) That god vouchsafes to make
men privy to his doi^ges / it is a goodness never thought upon never commended
enough. Which thing he shall sone perceue / that considers what god is / and
what we are / his exceeding great majesty / and our exceeding great vileness.
Which matter I will not now enlarge / but leave to your consideration.

This would be well noted that he says / that he will show him things that must
be don afterward. For some expoune the things that are spoken hereafter /
partly of things do^ under the old testament / and partly of things don under
the new. Which must needs be an error / and lead me^ in to wrong opinions /
making them begin at a wrong end / since he says plainly / that he will
show things to be don / after the time that he spoke with him / and not
things don before.

AND straight way I was in the spirit) I was so occupied and detained
altogether in the spirit / as if I had / had no body / as though I had
forgotten al bodily / and erthlie things.

Or the spirit of god came upon me / and possessed me / or as Bullinger
writes I was in a spiritual contemplation / and rapte in spirit. That he
says straight way / he shows the might / and efficacy of the voice / that
spoke unto him.

AND behold a throne was set in heaven) Gods throne is often spoken of /
and described in the scripture. For Esaie says in the.6. cha. that he saw god
sittinge upon a throne high / and advanced / and his train filled the temple
etc.

In the first cha. of his prophetie Ezechiel says / that he saw in heaven /
as it were a saphir / and the likeness of a throne. And he repeteth the same in
the.10. cha. Daniel in the.7. cha. shows that he saw gods throne
glisteringe like fire / and the wheles of it sent forth fiery flammes. But
gods throne is no where described so fully / so lively / and with so conninge
and pleasant words / as in this place. What this throne signifies / we may
easily gather out of the words of king David / for thus he sings in the.9.
psalm. God shall remain for ever / he has made ready his throne to judgment.
And he shall judge the world in righteousness / and decide the peoples matters
with equite. So than we understand by the throne gods imperial government /
and his iudiciarie administration. This throne is not in earth / but in heaven.
For god ^uleth not after any erthlie manner / but after an heavenly manner.
Nether is his judgment and government corruptible / and subject to an end /
but as David says / he remains a judge / a ruler / and gouerner for ever.
For in the hebrew tou^ge / to judge signifies to order / to rule / and govern.

AND upon the s^at there was one sitting) You know that it is god / and his son
/ that sits upon this throne.j. administreth / rules / and governs al
things.

AND he that sat was in sight like a iaspis / and a sardine stone) By the
colors of two precious stones the nature of God is some wise shadowed to saint
Io. and to us. Pliny writes that a iaspis is a grene stone / which is a fresh
/ and a pleasant color / and the color of many things that are lusty / and
lively. And therefore writers understand thereby gods perpetual continuance
/ his incorruptible / and immortal nature / as David says / thy years shall
not be ended. And not only that he is the ever living God / and continues
ever in life him self / but also that he gives life to al other living
creatures / and preserves them in grene / and lusty freshnes. A sardine has
a fiery color / and may express unto us gods sore judgment / and
vengeance upon unrepentant sinners.

And a rain bow was about the throne like in sight to an emrode) It is
marvelous comfortable to us / that gods throne is compassed about with the
rain bow. For the rain bow is a sacrament of gods perpetual mercy / and of
his most gracious couen^^t made with us. Who might abide the justice / and
seueritee of gods throne / if it were not compassed with mercy? For as David
says / if god would observe iniquites / according to his righteousness / who
should stand? But he has set his rain bow / and sacrament of mercy so round
about his throne / that his eyes ca^ never be of from it. He ca^ turn his
sight no way / but he must see it. And therefore now it is not to us a
terrible / and dradful throne / but as. S. Paul calls it / a throne of grace
/ whereu^to we may approach with boldness / and find ready help.

The color of this rain bow was like the color of an emrode / which is the
most fresch / and pleasant color / that any stone has. For in deed there is
nothing so delectable / and pleasant to us / as gods covenant of grace / and
mercy. And this covenant is ever grene / and endures ever to the behofe of
the chosen.

AND about the throne were.24. thrones and) That the.24. elders sat upon
thrones / for the greek word is al one here / and when mention is made of
gods throne / and that they were crouned / I think in deed that by them we
must vndrestand with Bullinger / the company of gods saints departed out
of this world / and now raigninge and triumphinge with the lord Jesus in
heaven. And I think that an allusion is made / and a regard had to the
kings of this world which have their counselors / and noble men sittinge
about them. For the scripture describes heavenly matters to us / by such
things as ar in ^re among us. Bullinger notes that.24. is made of.12. And
that the.12 Patriarchs signify at Israel / and the old church before the
incarnation of Christ. And the christian church was planted by.12. Apostles /
so that the nombre of 12. co^prehe^deth the hole congregation of the new
people. And after this sort.24. signify the hole triumphant church
consistinge of Iues and gentiles. These.24. ar apparelled with white garments.
For Christ has purged them / and made them fair / and clothed them with his
own puritee / and righteousness. They are crouned / for they overcame Satan /
and his hellisch army / while they lived in this world. And now they reign as
kings with Christ the lord in everlasting glory. That they sit / Bullinger
says it is not meant / that they be judges / but they ar said to sit /
because they rest from their labors / and now have quiet affections / and be
far from troblesome passions of mind.

Howbeit I see not, why mention should be made of thrones, if we shall not
vndrestand, that they sit as judges. Not that we mean, that they judge instead of Christ, but we mean, that they judge with him, that is to say, allow
his judgments, thinckinge the same thing in every matter, that he does,
and reioising in his doi^ges. For the lord has advanced them, to this
dignitee, as to sit with him in judgment.

For he has made al his things commune to his saints. His judgments, he
has made their judgments, his kingdom, their kingdom, his raigninge, their
raigninge, and so forth.

Now by this description of the thrones, golden crounes, goodly garments of
the saints departed out of this life, we may vndrestand the great glory,
and felicitee, that they live in.

Which thing should comfort us in these our afflictions, and miseries, that we
faint not, or be discouraged, knowi^ge that gods saictes passed by the same,
and now triu^phe in perpetual joy. The old heathen, me^ of great wits,
taught the youth of their time, that virtue dwells upon the top of an high
hille and that the way to the hill top is very rough, laborsom, and tedious,
but when a man is once comme to the top, he shall find a goodly plain,
goodly grene meadows, and al manner of pleasures. We know, taught by a more
certain scole master, that the way to heaven is very strait, and that
thorough many afflictions, we must enter in to gods kingdom. But when we be
once come thither, it can nether be spoken nor thought, what joy, what
pleasure, what felicitee we shall find there. Wherefore since the end of those
things, whereunto we are called, brings so great glory, and so great a sea
of al pleasures, and ioies, we ought not to be dismaide, because of the
difficulties, and ircksome tediousnes, that we find by the way. For we shall
sone pass thorough them. We can not long stick in them. For what is long in
this life? Let us therefore gird up the loins of our mind, as. S. Petre
speaks, and press forward to the price of the supernal calling of god, in
Christ Jesus. Let us with patience run out the race, that we are set in,
fasteni^ge our eyes upon the author, and finissher of our faith, who for the
joy, that was set before him, sustained, and despised the shame of the cross,
and now is sit down upon the glorious throne of God, and will lead us the same
way, to like honor, glory, and dignite. Unto god therefore, who has
sanctified our travails, our cross, and our miseries, and made the issue /
and end so happy. and blisful, be al glory, and honor for ever. Amen.

The next sondrie after this lecture, one of the company seemed by
circumstances to improve some part thereof. But when we h^d co^ferred
together, we fully agreed. Where upon I uttered this declaration following.

The second readinge.
It is very certain, that not only unbridled wanton wits of ungodly, wild,
fanatical, arroga^t, and proud spirits, sport them selves in mockinge of
gods prouidi^ce, but also that the weak, unlearned, and unexercised minds of
some g^dlie folk, ar trobled with this, that where as they hear, and be
taught by the holy scripture, that god is the ruler, and gouerner / of the
hole world / yet they see, that the despicers, and contemners of god, and
godliness, who^ god hates, and abhors, prosper in the world, they see that
the godly, whom god loves, ar oppressed, and vily entreated, they see that
lies falshod, violence, tyranny, false and fra^tike opinions, idolatry, and
superstition, reign every where, and truth, righteousness, virtue, and al
honesty, is trodden under foot, and lies wounded, maimed, and mangled in the
mire of the streets. Yea not only the weak ar offended here with but also some
farther grown, and more exercised, and endued with greater knowledge, begin
to slagger, and to doubt, whether the world be governed by gods providence,
or whether al things be tombled, and tossed by chance, when they see in how
great welt hand felicite the ungodly live, and how the godly wrestle and
tugge continually, with all manner of miseries, and calamities. For Asaph
confesses that his fete were al most ouerturned, and his steps slidden, when
he saw the peace.i. the prosperitee of the ungodly. He was so nigh a fall that
he was al most comme to this, to say, I have plainly cleansed my heart in
vain, until he entered in to gods holy places, considered more depely, his
providence, and so perced farther, and vndrest^de the end of the ungodly, how
God had set them in a slipperie place, to give them a more shameful fall. And
therefore, that is to be noted, he confesses, that before god had admitted
him, in to a farther vndrestanding of his providence, while he followed his own
witie in co^sideringe the affairs, and happes of the world, he was a very
beast before god. Jeremy also, though he acknowledge, that the world is
governed by gods providence, yet he can not co^prehende, by his wit, but
that things might be don better. For thus he says. Thou art just lord, if I
should contend with the. By these words it appears, that he acknowlegeth
gods providence, in gouerninge the world. For why should he complain to god,
about those things, where with god should have no thing to do if the world
were not governed by him? Or why should he acknowledge god to be just in those
things, wherein he is offended, and trobled, if they were not ordered by him.
For these words, thou art just lord / if I should contend with the, signify
as much, as if he should say, I know lord, that al things ar governed by the,
and come to pass by thy providence, and that thou have a just reason in all
thy doings, but I can not see it in many things, and namely in the
prosperity of the ungodly. For it follows, yet I will speak judgments with
the that is, yet me thi^keth some things go not right. Why is the way of the
ungodly prosperous, why be they happy, and live in all wealth, and ioilitie,
that tra^sgresse transgression, that is, which be extreme, and exceeding great
transgressors of thy laws? This is the thing, that trobleth the Prophet,
that seems not right. For it seems to man's reason iuster, that god should
advance, and prosper his friends, and faithful servants, and not such, as
despice him and his. But it is well, that he acknowlegeth that god is just. For
thereby he confesses, that there may be some what more in the matter, thou he
cold attain unto.

And yet he is angry with him self, that he cold not perceive the reason of
it. If this happened to so notable men, to men furnisched with so excellent
graces of god, to men so much exercised in spiritual matters, it is more
certain, that weak, and unpracticed minds, would be offended, trobled and
amassed with this, that antichrist should oppress gods ministers, overthrow,
and al most quench out the gospel of Christ, and al true doctrine, set up,
and blase abroad false religion, thorough ^ut all the world, and triumph in his
mischeife, not a few days, but many hundred years. Because this must needs be
very offensive to many, and make them waver, and doubt of gods providence,
it pleased god to show aforehand, by other his prophets, and apostles, and by
this his faithful servant. S. Joan, that these things should comme to pass,
that al me^ might know, that they fall not in by chance, but be governed, and
ordered by his wisedo^, and fore knowledge, and so arm them selves with
patience, in such ouerthwarte issues, as they some to us, consideringe that god
does al things most justly, and wisely, to his own glory, and the
furtheraunce of his chosen. If you will knew the causes, why god has appointed,
and ordained that antichrist shall rise, and set up his horns, and beat down
the true church, and stablishe his countrefaite preisthode, his kingdom of
shauelinges, his mo^ckerie, nonrie, and al his popery, his false doctrine, and
open beastly errors, search the scriptures. And if you find causes there
expressed, see that ye reverence in them gods wisdom, and righteousness. As
in deed some be there expressed, as I doubt not but you shall hear at large,
when our brother shall comme to that place in the.2. epistle to the Thessal. If
you find not al there expressed, or be not satisfied with the^, that be there
expressed, cry out with S. Paul. O the depenes of the riches, of the wisdom,
and knowledge of god and But yet there is one thing more, that trobleth many
wits now a days, wherein perchance they may be satisfied, or some what
quieted, and that is, how it can be, that al things come to pass, by gods
will, and ordinance, and yet many things in the world be don against his
word, and against his will. It is no meruail, if this be hard to vndrestande.
For. S. Augustine grau^teth, that it comes to pass, by a wondreful, and
unspeakable manner, that, that comes not to p^sse beside gods will, that is
don against his will. But ye shall know, that when men do evil worckes,
concerning the fault, and vice of their acts, they do that, that is against
gods will, but concerning the end, and that, that god will turn their evil
acts unto, they do the things that god will have to be don. And therefore. S.
Augustine says, very profoundly, and lernedly. These be the great,
wonderful, and exquisite worckes of god, that when man's, and angels nature
had sinned, that is, had don, not that he would, but that they would, even by the
same will of the creature, whereby that was don, that the creator would not, he
fulfilled that he would, vsinge well even evil things, as supremely good him
self, to the damnation of them, who^ he justly fore ordained to punishment,
and to the salvation of them, whom he mercifully foreordained to grace. For as
touching them selves, they did that god would not, but touching the
omnipotentie of god, they cold no way do it. For even in this, that they did
against gods will, gods will was don upon them. By these words he teaches
that though god abhor men's nawghtie, and wicked deeds, yet they comme not
to pass besides his will, and ordinance touching the end and use of them. For
he will make men's nawghtie deeds, serve to good ends, and uses. And therefore
the same author says again. When in the last day Christ shall comme to judge
the world, than in the most clear light of wisedo^, it shall appear, that now
the faith of the godly has, how certain, and inevitable, and most effectual
gods will is, how many things he can do, and will not, but wills nothing
that he can not do, and how true it is, that is sounge in the psalm. Our god is
in heaven, he has don, whatsoever he would, which surely is not true, if he would
have some things don, and has not don them. There is not than any thing don,
onles the omnipotent will have it don, either in suffringe it to be don, or in
doing it himself. Hitherto. S. Augustine.

And that you may vndrestand, that he takes gods suffringe, for gods
ordinance, though god work sondrie ways, some times by himself, and some
times by his creatures good, and bad, he goes farther, and says more over.
Netheri sit to be douted, but that god does well in suffering to be don, what
soever is don il.

For he suffers not this / but by just judgment. Though than those things,
that be evil, inasmuch as they be evil, be not good, yet it is good, that not
only good things, but also evil things should be. For if this were not good /
that evil things also should be / they should in no wise be suffered of the
almighty good i. god. To who^ without doubt as easy as it is, to do what he
will, so easy is it, not to suffer, that he will not to be don. Out of these
words we learn, that the divine man. S. August. vndrestode, that all the
things in the world comme to pass by the ordinance of god, and that gods
wisedo^ was such, that he saw it good / that evil things should be, and his
power such: that he cold turn those evils to good. Now lest any man should
think here upon, that god is the author of evil, he teaches, that there is
some thing in men's acts, not by gods propre worckinge, but by his
ordinance / to a certain end, and by the propre worckinge in deed of Satan,
and by man's own nawghtines. For god wrought not nawghtines in Adams heart
first, but ordained, that Satan moved with his own malice should turn Adam to
evil, and work nawghtines in him thorough Adams own fault. And that
nawghtines al Adams ofspringe, and posterite draw from him. Now than after this
sort al men ar made / evil and full of nawghtie desires. God the governor of
the world will have this nawghtines / that lurcketh in men's hertes / to be
bewraied, and brought forth to light, whereby his own wisdom, righteousness,
and mercy may be declared. So than he ordains that this man shall vttre in
act the lecherous desires that lie hidden in his heart, this his theuishe,
this his murtherous mind. And thus he ordreth al men's evil acts, so that no
thing comes to pass beside his ordinance, but he is not the author, and
propre worcker of the evil, that is in men's hertes. If he did work, and
cause an adulterous mind in a man, whose mind was pure, and innocent before,
and than moved him to vttre the same in act, and deed, he should be the author
of evil. But if he work not that adulterous mind, but finds the mind
corrupt and defiled by Satan, and by the person himself, and than ordains
where, and when, and to what ends the same shall be made open to the world, he
is not the author, and worcker, but the orderer, and disposer of evil. And in
this matter thus vndrestanded, you shall know that al we, whom it has pleased
god to appointe to treat his word in this place, do agree. For he that said,
that it (...) gods will, that Adam s^uld sin, in it not simply and (...)
way / that it was not gods will, that Adam should sin, but he meant, that tou
hinge the si^fulnes of Adams act, it was not gods will, that he should sin,
but ^^u ^inge the end, and that, that god would turn Adam sinful acre unto, he
grants that it was gods will, that Adam should sin. This much I ^hought
good to speak aforehand, because S. I^annes vision leads us to a
consideration of gods providence, and ordringe of al things / that happen to
the church in this later time: wherein we can not walk safely, o^les we know
the things, that I have told you. Now to the text.

And there proceeded out of the throne lightninges and tho^dring^s and voices,
and.7. lamps of fire burninge before the throne which he the.7. spirits of
god) These words in my opinion teach that all the things that are don in the
world proceed out of gods judgment, and be the effects of his spirit. When
the minds of gods chosen be illuminated, and lightened, when the wicked ar
fraied / and horribly strike^ with gods threats, as it were with
lightni^ges, wha^ gods preachers tho^dre against the corrupt manners of the
world, when they send forth the sweet voices of the gospel, when they exhort
and comfort, breifely when they show any grace and virtue, all this proceeds
out of godd^s throne, out of gods judgment, and these be the mighty worckes
of his spirit.

Whereby the providence of god is certainly set before us in gouerninge the
world. For by these special efficies, we must understand the h^le. F^r if any
part of the world, and men's doings, be governed by gods providence, than
al is governed by the same, since there is no conuenience, nor reason why he
should meddle with part, and not with all. For it agrees nether with his goodness
/ nor with his power, that he should leave any thing unlooked to, and
ungoverned. And therefore the scripture assigns the lest, and most
conte^tible worckes that be don in the world to gods providence, as in
hewinge of wood, the fallinge of an axe from the helue, whereby a man is
slain. And in Moseis tabernacle not only the golden table, the golden cherubs,
the golden arc, were made by gods appointement, but also the gredirons, the
disches, the spones, and the snuffers, and such other base things. S. Io.
recites the chief worckes of god, thondringes, lightninges, and voices, to
give us a light to see all the rest, and to make a way to enter farther.

And seven lamps burninge) By these.7. lamps I vndrestand, the holy ghost,
and his sondrie gifts, and graces, which burn, ar quick, lively, and busy
in worcking, give light, and co^f^r^e to gods chosen without ceasing. This is
Moseis golden candlestick, with seven candles burninge continually.

Which be the.7. spirits of god) The seven lamps be, that is signify, and
represent the seven spirits of god. But how is it, that he attributes to
god.7. spirits. For we know, that god has but one spirit, and that spirit
cannot be divided, and sondred in to parts.

G ddes one spirit is called seven spirits, because he is furnished with,
seven, that is / with sondrie and innumerable graces. For seven in the
scripture is a perfect no^bre, and signifies fulness. So gods seven
spirits, is as much to say, as gods seuenfold spirit, that is gods
spirit full of al good gifts proceeds from gods throne.i. is sent in to
men's hertes / and worcketh s^ndrie effects in them according to gods
judgment.

And in the sight of the throne there was a glassie sea like Crystal) The sea
is variable / and unstable / some times caume / and quiet / some times
troblesome and raging / and therefore the world is expressed by it in the
scripture / wherein there is much tossing and turmoiling / great unstableness /
many wondreful chaunges / and turns. This sea is glassie.

Glass is also very britle / and may signify the frailty of the world. But
because the sea is afterward likened to crystal / and that both glass / and
crystal excelle in clearnes / I think that the sea is said to be glassie /
and christalline / because that al things / that are do^ in the world / ar open
to gods eyes. For as in crystal there is not a thing so little, but that it
may be seen / so there is no thing do^ in the world so small / as that it can
escape Gods sight and knowledge. This sea is before the throne / that is /
subject to gods judgment, rule / and government. And therefore fortune /
and chance have no place therein. Nothing is do^ inco^siderately / and
atauenture.

Men do not what they list / but their doings ar subject to Gods throne.
The Medes / and Persians did not what they listed / nor put on weapons upon
their own devise without god against the Babilonians / but as we have in Esaie
/ the lord commanded his sanctified.i. who^ he had prepared / and he called
his strong valiant soldiars / to exequute his wrath. Senacherib the king of
the Assirians did not what he listed against the people of Jerusalem. For god
said / that he would put an hook in his nostrels / and a bridle in his lips
/ and bring him back / by the way / that he came.

Yea what soever he did against Jerusalem / he did by gods appointment. For
thus says god in the.19. of Esai. O Assure / the rod of my fury / and the
staff of my wrath. I will send him to an hypocrital people / I will command him
against the people of my indignation / to spoil spoils etc. Nabuchodonosor
did not / what he listed / nor rose of himself without god / against Sion. For
god says in the.29. of Esa. to David's city. I will besege the / and assaultee
the by towers / and raise up heaps of earth / against the. And of the king of
Babilo^ / he says in the.51. of Iere. Thou art my hammer / and weapons of
war / I have by the beaten down nations / and destroyed kindo^mes. I have by
the beaten down the horse / and his rider etc. Saying than that men ar
subject to gods throne / and do not what they list / but be his instruments
scourges / hatchettes / and hammers / we ought patiently to sustain our
present affliction, and the great misery of our country. And we may well
conceive hope of conforte, and of better state, consideringe / that god has
also, an hoke in the nostrelles, and a snaffle in in the mouths even of the
unmerciful oppressors of his servants in England / whereby he will draw them
another way / and restrain their rage, when he has duly plaged the
reprobate, and sufficiently chastised his chosen.

Only let us remove the causes, of these our miseries, namely lothinge of
gods holy word, boilinge lusts, idle wantonness, and greedy desires of
wordlie things, and we shall see shortly Pharao, and his furious army drouned
in the red sea. And we that have long sounge morneful songs, shall change our
tunes, and singe another while ioifully with Moses, and M^riam. The lord is our
strength, and our praise, and he his our salvation, this is our god, and we will
magnify him, our fathers god, and we will advance him. For this let us pray,
to this let us say, Amen, amen.

After this lecture, it pleased the party spoken of before, to make certain
arguments against mine assertion, whereunto here follows the au^swer.

The third reading.
My conscience bears me witness, that thorough gods grace, and goodness, I
have taught you the truth in this place, and that I have spoken reverently of
god, and his worckes. I am charged in deed with vnreuerent speech. But alas,
what should move me to speak irreverently of hi^ who made me, when I was
nothing, who saved me, when I was lost, who restored me to life when I was ded,
who quited me, when I was to be damned, who raised me up to heaven, wh^ I was
to be cast in to hell / who has fed m^ from my cradle, and than most
plentiously, wh^ I was an orphane, who also I am certain, hat^ delivered me
out of many dangers, thauoidance whereof to procure, I had nether counsel,
nor purpose, nor thought, in whom no^ being chased out of my country, and
banished from mine acquaintance, and known friends, I find sweet comfort,
and great plenty of ioies / even in the midst of tears. But the manner of my
speaking foundeth irreverently / though in my mind / I may think reverently.

If this be an vnreuerent speech, to say, that it was gods will, and
ordinance, that Adam should sin, than this is an vnreuerent speech / to say,
that it was gods will, and ordinance / that the Iues should crucify Christ,
and that Iosephes brethern should sell him in to Aegypte.

But the holy ghost says / by the mouth of his holy Apostles / and primitive
church, that the Iues and the gentiles came together to do, what soever gods
hand, and purpose, had ordained to be don. And the same holy ghost says by
the mouth of the right virtuous, and holy man Joseph, you sent me not hither,
but god.

Howbeit you must know, that when we say, that it was gods will, and
ordinance, that Adam should sin, the meaning is not, that god delighted in
Adams sin, or that god allowed Adams sin, or that god was the propre cause,
or propre worcker of Adams sin / but the meaning is, that it was gods will,
that Adam should sin, thorough Satan's envy / and Adams own fault, not for
the sins sake / or in respect of the sin, but for the end that he would
turn the sin unto. And that the hole matter, that I have taught you herein
is true I have a sure ground. For the scripture teaches plainly, that all the
things, that are don in the world, ar governed by gods will. The testimony of
Solomon, is plain, that God h^th wrought al things for him self, eue^ the
ungodly, to an evil day. And. S. Paul speaking of gods bli^ding, and
rejecting of the Iues, and receiving of the gentiles to mercy, pronounces,
that al things ar of him / by him, and into him. Jeremy repeouing the furious
madness of them, that denied gods providence in his time, makes this dema^de,
with a stomach. Who is he, that says, a thing is don, and god commanded it
not, that is to say, ordained it not? The same Jeremy, when the king of
Babilo^ purposed to invade the Moabites, and being now in his iornaie, changed
his purpose, and came against Jerusalem, cries out. I know, lord, that man's
way is not his own, nether is it of man / to govern, and to direct his own
steps.

And therefore Solomon says also, that man's steps ar guided of god. And
to tea^h us certainly, that nothing comes to pass by chance, and to remove
al matter of doubtinge in this question, the same Solomon teaches / that those
things, wherein hap seems most to have place, proceed out of the iudgdme^t of
god.

Lottes, says he, ar cast in to the lap, but the hole judgment is from
Iehoua. How eloquently, and how diligently, is this matter beaten in to men's
heads, in the propheties of Esaie? Where god, after that he has showed, that
he would raise up king Cyrus, from the east, to beat dounne Babylon, and to
conquer many nations, to the confusion of al Epicures babbling band, asks
this question. Who has wrought, and don these things? And answers thereto
himself. I Iehoua the f^rst, and with the last, any hu, I am he. And in the
45. cha. I the lord, and there is no more, framing light, and causing darcknes
/ making pe^ce, and causing evil, that is, wa^re I Iehoua do al these things.
Breifely all the places of the scripture, that teach, that god is the judge, and
governor of the world / teach that al things comme to pass by his will, and
ordinance. But this truth has had adversaries in all ages. For to go no
higher. S. Hierome, though he have some sentences, that some to make with us,
yet he has one sentence, that puts me out of doubt, that he halted, and
went to much a wrie in this matter. For writing upon one of the prophets, he
says in mockage, that some ar so strait mainteiners of gods providence,
that they affirm / that god knows, how maneflies, and gnattes there be in
the world, which he thincketh to be to base a matter, for god to be occupied
in. But how untrue this is, you know, that have heard the lord Jesus / who is
in gods bosom, and knows al his secrets, affirm, that the hears of our
heads ar nombred, and that there falls not a little sparow upon the earth,
beside the will, and ordinance of our heavenly father.

Nether may you think, that god knows flies, and gnattes, and little
sparowes with ircksom tediousnes, which is found in man, because of his
weacknes. And therefore when the prophet Esaie speaks of gods providence,
how he brought forth the army of heaven, that is to say, the stars, and
called every one by name, says thus Why say thou Jacob / my way is
hidden from Iehoua, and my judgment shall pass from my god, that is to say,
gods ordinance extends not to me? Do thou not know / that the eternal
god Iehoua / who made the utter most parts of the earth, is not werie / nor
feleth tediousnes / or pain, and that his vndrestanding can not be serched out?

By these words Hieromes fear, that god should be overmuch unseemly busied
with so small things, is proved fond, and superfluous.

Well, such adversaries the truth had than. Howbeit it had also as strong
maintainers,

For. S. Augustine in the same time gloriously, and inuincibly defended it, and
to this day he reigns in it / as a mighty conqueror of al them, that dare
hiss against it. The later scole men, thought not altogether amiss of this
matter. For they say, that al things comme necessarely to pass, not by the
necessitee of natural causes, but by the necessitee of gods ordinance, which
they call necessitatem conseque^tie. Some sophisters, that followed afterward,
delighting them selves in choplogike, and in braules, and vain subtilties,
labored on thotherside to impugn the truth hereof. And in our time the popes
pear of bastard divines Eckius, and Pigghius have taken the same thing in
hand. And not only papists ar busy herein, but also some professors of true
religion, either because they be preposterously fearful, or because they have
wanton idle wits. In this later order I compte the hartiehard hartians in
England. In the the nombre of the first, I put Philippe Melanchthon, who in the
beginning, was very ernest, and free, but afterward when he saw, the
perue^site of the raging world, being a man naturally fearful, he began to
give place, and to bear with the pap^stes in more things, than this. Howbeit
I think surely, that he relented not altogether of fear, but partly to win
the weak, whose tender young stomakes cold not broke so hard meat, at the
first. For he is a right godly man, and studious to promote sincere doctrine
by all means. Melanchih^n than stands not plainly with us, nether stands he
plainly against us. For if ye marcke his writings thoroughly, he impugneth,
and beats down only this, that god is the author of sin, where in no man
dissenteth from him, save the mad Manichees in old time, and in our time men
like to them, the lost Libertines. I think well, that there be some other good
men, which to avoid the offense of unlearned tender ears / forbear to speak
plainly, what they think in this matter. But Zuinglius, and Oecclampadius,
two lights of the world, Martinus Lutherus, and Martinus Bucerus, men of in
comparable knowledge, and lerninge, Petrus Matyr, and Ioannes Caluinus, of which
two the first in sondrie sciences, and in present readiness and liuelines of
wit excels all the me^, that we know in Europe, the other in eloquence, in
handsome handlinge, and vndrestandinge of the scripture, is a miracle to al men
/ even to the very papists. Al these, by whom god has most wondrefully
renewed his truth in this later time, have expressly, plainly, fully, and
strongly not only affirmed, but also with most pithie and sound reasons
confirmed the things, that I have taught you in this place, and at this
present rehearse unto you. Now seeing I have spoken after the meaning, and manner
of the holy ghost, and after the vndrestanding of most godly / and most
excellently well learned men, I trust you will not think / that I have spoken
rashely, or irreverently of god, and his worckes.

I have chosen in deed purposely, to treat such places among you, as touch
gods providence in governing the world, partly to conforte my self, and you
in this woeful time, and partly to show the inconsiderate wilfulnes of the
harriharde hartia^s, and such beggarly doctors in England. Now some for
exercise of lerninge / have set them selves against me in this my trauail, of
who^ I need not to be much aferde, for two causes. First because they bring
not with them bitterness of mind / nor hatred either against me / or against the
truth.

Secondly because they fight with leaden swords. For against that / that I
said for the through mainteinance of gods providence / that it was gods will,
and ordinance, that Adam should sin / they make this fainte reason: Ada^s
sin was iniquitee, but god wills none iniquitee, ergo and I answer, that
these logicians begile them selves, in douteful terms.

For to will / has a double signification.

For we may be said to will a thing, when we allow it, or delight in it. And so
Dauides word, lo kaphets, certainly signifies, and should be thus englished:
Thou art not a god, that has pleasure in iniquitee. And we may be said also
to will a thing, when we delight not in the thing nor allow it, but ordain it
to be do^, for some purpose. If these men that be our adversaries in disputing
/ not in meaning / vndrestand by this world / to will / that god delighted not
in Adams sin / nor allowed it / so say we. And than they fight against their
own shadows. But if they mean / that it was not gods decree / and
ordinance / that Adam should sin, for another purpose I mean, than for the
respect of sin, tha^ we say / they go about to pulle god out of his throne
/ to spoil him of his power / and violently to wrest out of his hands his
office of judging / and governing the world. And they ascribe weacknes to god.
For they so teach, that things be don whether god will, or no. The second
argument is, that god in forbidding Adam to eat of the fruit / doclared his
will to be, that Adam should not eat thereof. But if god had been in will, that
Adam should have eaten of the fruit, that had been a contrariete in god, ergo
etc. To this I say shortly, that god in deed by his commaundment, testified to
Adam / what his pleasure was / and what he allowed / and again what Ada^s duty
was to do toward him / but this let not god to will, and decree, that Ada^
thorough his own fault, should do the thing / that god allowed not in it self
/ but ordained to be don / for the end / that he would turn it unto. Because
god liked not / nor allowed Adams sin, might he not therefore ordain it to
be don for some good end?

Who has given you such autoritee over god to cut short his power, that he
shall do no more than pleases you, or that you can be content to judge well
don? Lo how terrible these weapons be, which break in shiuers, before they
comme to the stroke. But now comes another mighty blow he that does the will
of god, pleases god, but Adam in breaking the commaundment of god, pleased not
god, ergo he did not his will. I pray you good friends, should Adam please god
in doing gods will, and ordinance with a fault of his own?

Senacherth did gods will, and ordinance in afflicting the people of
Jerusalem, but because he did it, with a fame of his own, god plaged him, for
doing that, that he testifies, he had appointed him to do. If you can not
perceive, how men may do Gods decreed will / with a fault of their own /
impute it to your ignorance / and want of vndrestanding / and think it not by
and by, to be false, that your measured wit can not comprehend. The next
argument is like the for ner / God rewarded not Adam with benifices / ergo he
did not that gods will was to be don. I will make the like reason. God rewarded
not the Iues with benefits, for crucif^inge of Christ, ergo it was not gods
will / and ordinance / that the Iues should crucify Christ. But yet the holy
ghost says, that they did, that gods hand and purpose had foreordained to be
don.

Pigghiu^ the papist frames the argument thus. Adam in si^ninge, and the Iues
in procuring Christ's death, did that god would, and had ordained before to be
don / ergo they were not to be punished. For right vndrestanding hereof / ye
shall know, that god / and wick^d men / will some times one thing, but not after
one manner. Adams will was to sin, and gods will was, that he should sin.

But Adams will was to sin because he would be ^qual to god / i^ knowinge of
good, and bad.

And gods will was, that Adam thorough his own fault should sin / to turn
Adams sin to good / and to bring good out of evil.

The Iues will was to put Christ to death / and gods will was / that his son
should die.

But the Iues will was / that he should die, because they would satisfy their
malice, and cruelty upon him, and godddes will was / that he should die, to
ransom his chosen, and so to declare h s ^^^sti^^able goodness. Saint
Augustine shows very handsomely, how god wills the same thing / with a
good will / that men will, which a nawghtie will. An unthrifty child ^^^^^h the
death of his father / who^ god will have to die. They both will one thing, namely
the death of the man, but they will it not, after one sort. For the enthriftie
son wills it, to emote his father goods. God wills it / to conuete him
out of misery, if he be one of the chosen / or duly to punish him / if he be a
reprobate. Is this unthrift than worthy to be rewarded with benifites,
because he would the same thing that god would? Naie surely. For he willed it
unjustly, to an evil purpose, and god willed it justly, to a good porpose.
Boys in scoles to practice then sophistry, make the argument, as handsomely,
after this sort. That will, that agrees with gods will, is good / the Iues
will agreed with gods will, for they would that Christ should die, and god also
would / that he should die, ergo their will was good. To this wise men answer,
that the Iues will agreed not with gods will, in all causes, and in all points,
and therefore it was not good, but extremely evil. The argument the refore is
nawght. For it is deducted ex causa non sufficient.i. of a cause not
sufficient.

But let us peruse more of our adversaries reasons. God made man to
immortality, ergo it was not his will, that he should sin, and die. I answer,
that this is not an absolute speech, god made man to immortality, but a
co^ditional. God made man to immortalite, if he would have persisted, and
continued in the state, that god made him in. When Jonas says / yet.40.
days, and Niniue shall be destroyed, this speech declares not gods secret
determination, but what should follow, if they did not repent.

God says to Abimelech, having taken to him Abraham's wife. Lo thou shall die
for the woman, whom thou have taken. This seems an absolute speech, but in
deed it has a secret condition, which the scripture afterward expresses in
these words. Restore her now to her husband, if thou restore her not (see the
condition expressed), know that thou shall surely die. Yet there remains
another reason, that would make any man to quake, if he had nether wit / nor
sparcke of a man's mind. If you grant not co^tingentiam say they, than ye
affirm, that al things come to pass by fatal destinee.

Here first I must tell you what co^tingens is.

Co^tingens is that, which though it be do^ after some certain sort, yet has
of it self, and of his own nature, that it might have been otherwise do^. As
for exemple / Julius Caesar overcame Po^peie. There is nothing in the nature
hereof, but that Po^peie might have ouerco^me Julius Caesar. The legs of the
lord Jesus of their own nature might have been broken. Than we say, that many
things of them selves, and of their own nature, be co^tingent, but touching
gods will, and ordinance there is nothing co^tingent in the world, that is to
say, nothing in the world comes to pass, other wise than he has
determined, and ordained. And so we say, that Julius Caesar must needs
ouerco^me Po^peie, and that the legs of the lord Jesus cold not be broken by
reason of gods ordinance. But so we agree with the stoikes, that say, that
al things come to pass, by fatal destiny. Naie surely. For those fo^de
philosophers taught, that al things comme to pass by the copulatio^ of causes
wrapped one in another. And they made god subject to this order / and row of
causes depending one upon another, after such sort, as Homere devised his
chain, whereu^to he tieth Iuppiter also. But we say not, that al things
come to pass, for that the causes ar so licked to gether, that one thing
necessarely draws another, but because god has thorough his secret will, and
purpose, ordained al things so to be do^ as there be do^. And we make not god
subject to ^^ained, and lincked causes, but we make al causes. and al things
subject to god.

This than that our adversaries would fraie us withal, was nothing, but
lightninge out of a basin.

After that I had gone this far, two other reasons of theirs, were brought unto
me, wh ch though they may be confuted, by that, that I have al ready said,
yet I will examine them, because I hear / that they acknowledge most strength to
be in them. The first is this. If it had been gods will, that Adam should sin,
than Adam should have wanted free will / but god gave him free will / to keep his
command m^t if he would, ergo it was not gods will / that he should sin. This
reason shines to them, as it were gold, but in deed it is but gilted latin.
For gods will / and ordinance let not, but that Adam should do freely, and
willingly without compulsion that he did, nether did Adam sin, thorough want
of free will, and natural strength. If any did affirm / that god compelled
Adam to sin, than complaint might be made that Adam wanted free will.

And a reason might be framed against us upon Adams free will. But if god
ordained, that Adam should sin, without compulsion / thorough his own fault,
and abuse of his free will, than this reason has no manner of force / and the
complainte is made without cause.

But you will say, that there was no fault in Adam / if that were necessarely
to be don, that he did. I deny the consequence. For if he did willyngly break
gods commaundment, as it is evident, without compulsion / there was a fault
great enough in him. The devil does those things necessarely, that he does /
and can not choose but do them, yet because he does them willingly without
compulsion / thorough the rage of his nawghtie will, he is justly to be damned.
So though Adam did that must needs be don, yet because he did it without
compulsion, thorough a manifest fault of his own, he deserved damnation. For
it is not al one to do a thing of necessite, and to do a thing of constraint.
For god does good necessarely, and can not do otherwise, and yet he does not
good constrainedly. The devil / as I showed you does evil necessarely, and can
do none other, and yet he does not the same co^strainedly, but most willingly.
And thus nether man, nor devil can excuse their fault, by gods ordinance,
and by necessitee. For gods ordinances co^pelleth nether man, nor devil, to
do il, and so leaves a place to their own fault. For they do that they most
desire, and would do none otherwise to choose. If men will see this, they must
put of the old spectacles of fleshly bleared eyes, and desire of god a new
sight, and to be made aegleeyed of him. Hear now the second argument. Sin,
and death / ca^me in to the world by the envy of the devil, and the nawghtie
concupiscence of Adam in transgressing gods commaundment, but the envy of
the devil, and the nawghtie concupiscence of Adam, were contrary to gods will
/ ergo it was not gods will / that Adam should sin. I grant that Adams
nawhhtie concupiscence, and the devils envy, ar contrary to gods will, if
you mean by gods will, that god never allowed, either the devils envy, or
Adams nawghtie concupiscence. But will you say this / death camme into the
world, by the envy of the devil, ergo it was not ordained by god? Who than
ordained death, whether god would or no? Did god / as Esaie teaches ordain
gehenna, from yester day, that is to say, from eternitee, and not death? As
death than came not in to the world besides gods ordinance, and yet god
delights not in death, as it is only death, but as it is the just punishment
of sinners, so sin camme not in to the world besides gods ordinance / and
yet god delights not in sin, as it is sin / but in that, that he will
turn sin unto. You have heard the reasons, that they think may be made
against me, hear now how they dissolve my reasons, made against them. In which
matter they feately discharge them selves, of over much labor. For they medel
but with one of mine, the other that they say is mine, camme out of their own
shoppes, and was never made by me. To show that Adams sin, ca^me not to
pass, besides gods ordinance, I alleged this sentence of. S. Augustine. Even
in this, that they did against gods will, gods will was fulfilled upon them.
These words, say they, make against your assertion. For Augustine says that
the angels apostates, and Adam did that, that god would not. But I pray you,
what say they to this, that. S. Augustine says, that by the same their act,
gods will was fulfilled upon them? Here they give them selves, and us leave /
and space enough, to breathe. They cut the band in sondre, where the knotte
is not, as for the knotte it self, they never touch, and yet would have men to
ween, that they have very well loosed it.

The argument, which they forge them selves, and feign to be mine, is this.
Nothing can be do^ in the world besides the will of god, sin is a thing,
ergo it is not don beside the will of god.

In this argument, they deny the minor, and say that sin is nothing. If I
should have made a syllogism, I would have framed it after this sort. Nothing
in the world is do^ besides gods will, and ordinance, that Adam sinned was a
thing don in the world, ergo it was don by gods will, and ordinance. In the
minor, when I say, that Adam sinned, I mean Adams sinful action, and deed,
and, not the qualitee only of Adams mind, but in their minor / sin
signifies only a qualitee / and not an action. Howbeit I may also say truly
of Adams sin, meaning the qualitee, or what soever you will call it, that it
was not in him, besides gods will, and ordinance, though god caused it not,
and than frame the syllogism after this sort. All that was in Adam, was in
him, by godddes gods will, and ordinance, but sin was in Adam, ergo it was
in him by gods will, and ordinance. For it is not al one / to say, that sin
was in Adam by gods will and ordinance, and to say / that sin was in Adam,
by gods propre worckinge. The first saying is very true, and ascribes no
fault to god. The second is very false, for it ascribes the fault of Adams
fall, to god, From which affirmation, I most ernestly abhor.

And I would to God I might be once half so far from other faults, as I am far
from that frantike imagination, and droncken dream of devilish men. Where
they say, that sin is nothing, you shall vndrestand, that in scoles this
word, nothing, is taken two ways, for nothing negatiuely, and for nothing
priuatiuely. To say, that sin is nothing negatiuely, is open blasphemy.
For so men should be damned for nothing at al. But they take this word,
nothing, for nothing priuatiuely, and teach, that sin is a privation, and
absence of righteousness / which is a destruction of nature, for which god
abhors the creature, that is defiled therewith. I grant they mean so, and
teach so, and so means. S. Augustine to / but saying the unlearned can not
make a difference, and distinction of nothing negatiuely, and nothing
priuatiuely, nor can well vndrestande what priuatio^ is, though they be taught,
that darcknes is the privation of light, and death of life, our aristarches
should leave those terms to scoles, and teach the people, as the truth is, and
as they may easily vndrestand, that sin is a qualitee repugnant, and
contrary to gods laws. For they ar better acquainted with this word
qualitee, than with this word privation. And logicians permit, that
priuations shall be referred to the same predicament / that those things be in,
whereunto they ar co^traries. As for exemple, darcknes is contrary to light /
and light is a qualitee, therefore darcknes shall be referred to the same house.

(...) sin is contrary to righteousness / and righteousness is a qualitee,
therefore we shall put sin^e (...) the same predicament / and row, that
r^ghte^snes is in / and say, that sin is a qualitee whereby man's nature is
corrupt / and (...), and s^^^de worthy to be cast away / and condemned of
god. But now these good (...) their reas^ning, and give us good counsel. (...)
bid us be wary, and forbear to (...) suc^ things, as the wicked may turn
(...). But so we shall cease to preach (...)mercies of god. For wicked men
turn that to evil. For the papists say, that by preachinge of gods mercies
/ we encourage men to sin. And some wicked men perchance take occasion
thereby in deed, to sin the more boldly. But they play the sophisters and
take non causam pro causa. For the very cause in deed of men's corrupt
behauior is their inward boiling sinful lust, and not our preachi^g.

Wherefore we may not forbear to speak the truth, because evil men can
wringe things to evil purposes. But now let us comme to the lesson, that
these good scolemasters have given you, whereby ye ar taught to overthrow
shortly, and whithout sweat, whatsoever we can allege / for the maintenance
of our sentence.

For when it is said, that it was gods will, that Ada^ should sin, you must
say, that god suffered Adam to sin, and so forth. But these sufferers / that
turn al gods doings, in to suffringes / preately suffer them selves to be
begiled, if they ween, that many will straight way believe them. For shall we
say, that god suffered the Iues to conspire Christ's death / when the holy
ghost says, his hand foreordained it? When Micha says to Ahab. Lo the lord
has given the spirit of liyng in to the mouth, of al thy prophets / is that
nothing else but god has suffered thy prophets to lie?

Wha^ god bids the liyng spirit to go, and to deceive Ahab / I trow / he
does more / than suffer him to go. I say not this, as though this word
suffringe might nowaie be ascribed to god, but I say, that they ar evil
scolemasters / that teach you to turn al gods doings in to suffringes, and
yet teach you not in what sense, you shall take the word suffringe. For
suffringe is taken sondrie ways. We may suffer a thing with our will, and we
may suffer a thing against our will. He suffers also a thing to be don, that
meddleth not at al with the matter. And he suffers a thing to be don, that is
content, and agrees, that it shall be don.

If they say / that god sufferd Adam to sin, as one that would not meddle with
the matter / that is plain sacrilege, and robs god of his honor. If they
would signify in saying / that god suffered Adam to sin, that he was not the
propre worcker, and author of his sin / but ordained Adam to sin, by Satan's
propre worckinge, and his own fault, than they mean, as we mean. And than
their marvelous high lesson is vanished in to smoke.

Now to make at end, thus I trust you see that I stand unwounded, and unhurt
against these sore blodie blows. If any man think, that I have been to
quick against them / that be adversaries in words, and not in meaning, let
him considre, that I have not had respect to them only, but also to the
papists, which ernestly use the same weapons against us.

And further, because I trauail to mainteyne the glory of my god, which
shines to the dasellyng of wicked men's yes in the hole government of the
world, I thought good to use some quicknes / and liuelines of words / to awake
the dulnes of my hearers. God our most merciful lord, and father increase the
knowledge of his providence in us al, arm us with patience in these miseries,
and confirm in us, the hope of a better state. Amen, amen.

An exposition of these words (Lead us not in to tentation.) made by Bar.
Traheron, long before these former lectures, and now added hereto, that you
may know, that he never said nor thought that god is the author of sin, as
some most falsely, and ungodly, would have men to ween.

Lead us not and) God tempts, and tries men sondrie ways, and to sondrie
ends. First to begin with his own, whom he chose in Christ Jesus, and
prepared to euerbastinge life before the fundations of the world were laid, he
tempts and tries them to sondrie ends, namely either to make their virtues
which he him self has wrought in them, to shine forth more clearly, or to
open their shame, and nawghtie corrupt nature / that so afterward they may
live i^ greater warines, and fear of god / and more ernestly desire his help,
knowinge better their own wickedness. To the end, whereof, we spoke first, he
tempted Abraham, and Job to bring, I mean, their virtues to light, and to
make them more certainly known. To the other end, he tempted king David, and.
S. Petre, and many other, not utterly to destroy them, but to humble them /
to teach them to know, and abhor their own wickedness, and to feel more
certainly, his great goodness, and mercy.

And though god use this temptation to the profit of his chosen, yet they
ought to pray, that they may not fall in to it. For though it be so, that god
of his great goodness, makes our nawghtines to turn to his glory / and our
wealth, yet the godly ought to abhor, to commit any thing / whereby their
god is justly offended.

But you will say / if he be offended with those our deeds / why brings he us
in to them?

With our deeds he is surely offended, but he is delighted with that, that he
brings to pass by them, namely with our humilitee, with our better knowledge
of our own weakness, and with our more wary walking afterward in due fear of
him. This tentation, in to which God brings his elect / endures but a time.

But he brings some in to a perpetual tentation / utterly giuinge them up to
Satan, and hardening them in wickedness for ever. The godly do not pray / that
they may not be led in to this temptation. For they have a sure confidence,
that they ar gods children. For otherwise they might not call him father. And
if they think, that they be gods children, they must think / that they be
gods chosen. And because they be gods chosen / they must think, that they
can be no more damned / than god can cease to be god. For who^ he has o^ce
chose^, the^ he has chosen for ever. Nether ca^ he repe^te him of the thing,
that he has once purposed / nor change his purpose. For that should argue some
imperfection in him / which can not be in the divine nature. Wherefore the
godly ar out of danger, and fear of this tentation.

For they believe not only that god is their father, but that he will ever be
their father. For he is father to none, saving to those, whom he in fallibly
chose before the fundations of the world were laid, whom in time he giueih to
his son to be saved / and preserved for ever. For no man can take them out of
his hand, and those that comme to him, he casts not out.

Wherefore since noman, nor devil can take them out of his hand by force / and
since he has no will to cast them out / they ar safe / and sure for ever. But
here rises a great difficulte. For it seems unjust, that god should lead some
in to temptation, and harden them / and give them up for ever to sin / and
yet punish the^ for their sins. Nevertheless we say, that god leads into
tentation / not only whereby men's virtues ar brought to light, or their
weakness uttered / to their wealth, which happens to the chosen, but also
whereby they ar hardened / and made stiffer in their wickedness / and given up
to sin, which happens to the reprobate. And that this is so, the scripture
teaches plainly, where we have, that god hardened Pharaos heart / and gave up
idolatres to shameful raging lusts, and where it is said, to the preacher of
the gospel. Go, and engrosse the hertes of this people, make dull their ears,
stop their eyes, that they se not / with their eyes etc. Certain writers,
because they can not see how this may be don justly / alter the tongue of the
holy ghost, and for lead us not / they say, suffer us not to be led / and
where god says / he hardened Pharao, they say, he suffered him to be
hardened. And so in teaching the holy ghost to speak, they think, that they
have avoided al absurditee, and inconvenience.

But so in deed they avoid one inconvenience with another, yea with an
inconvenience / they run from the truth. Other better learned say, that god
is greater, than man's reason, so that it is no meruail, if we can not see his
judgments thoroughly. For often times / the devises of very wise men, seem
unjust, and unwise to us at the beginninning, and yet when we see the issue,
and end of them, we are compelled, to confess / that those things were
righteousely don / that we at the first thought to be folish. So when we shall
enter in to gods sanctuary, and se god, as he is / we shall perceive that he
never did any thing / unjustly, or unreasonably / but that he has dealt with all men according to the utter most point either of equitee, or of mercy. All this is very truly spoken. How beit, I see not, but that even in this life, we
may see good, and just causes, that god should harden the reprobate / and lead
them in to this baleful temptation. For are not they worthy to be hardened? And
what unrighteousness is it, to harden the^, that are worthy to be hardened? For
you must vndrestande, that when the scripture says, that god hardens men,
the meaning is not / that they were soft before, and that than god hardened
them / for when were they soft? But the meaning is, that god makes them harder.

And that is justly don. For their former hardness deserved to be made harder.
In deed if they had been soft before / and than hardened by god, there had been
some place left to a complaint.

But if god punish their former hardness, with more hardness, he deals with
the^, most justly.

This being considered / that the reprobate ar never soft, but ever hard, as
it is evident, I see not so great difficulty in the matter. For why should not
god harden them / that are worthy to be hardened / by reason of their former
hardness? Why should not god lead them in to perpetual temptation, and give them
over for ever, that are worthy to be led in to perpetual tentation, and to be
given over for ever? If any man will say, that it is gods fault, that he
softeneth not al men, let him show, that god first hardened al men. If al men
first hardened them selves / what shall constrain him to make the^ soft again?
If he will, he shows his mercy / if he will not, he shows his righteousness.
But who shall co^pelle him to show his mercy, where he may show his justice?
If than he harden, he does justly, if he soften, he does mercifully. By
knowledge hereof, the godly shall have this profit, that they shall much more
have in reverent admiration, the exceeding great goodness of god, when they shall
considre / that he vouchsafed to take them in to the nombre of those, whom of
his mercy he would softe^ where of his justice he might have hardened them for
ever. Thus I trust, I have showed you just causes, why god hardens some, and
leads them in to such tentation, as brings with it everlasting destruction.
Howbeit I deny not / but that in many worckes of god / before we can judge
rightly, we must tarry, until we may see them altogether, and not by pieces.
For there be many things among us here in this world, which we should judge
il favored, if we should see but pieces of the^, which being seen together / ar
most comely, and beautiful. So if we we will see the decent, and comely order
of gods doings, we must tarry, til we may see the hole body together, and
not a leg in one place, and an arm in another a mile of, and the head, as
far distant. But we may not pass thus from this matter. For there be some
sentences of the scripture, that seem to impugn our saiynge, and to teach
partly that god tempts no man, partly that he tempts no man to vttre
destruction. Touching the first. S. James says, let no man, when he is
tempted, say, that he is tempted of god. For as god can not be tempted of
evil, so he te^pteth noman. But every man is tempted, while he is drawn
away, and baited with his own lust. To this I say, that. S. James means
plainly, that god tempts noman, as the author and worcker of sin in him. For
god causes not evil in a man's heart, and than stirs him to commit that
evil in act, that he has caused and wrought in him, but where as man is evil
of him self / thorough Adams fall, and full of vices, by his own corrupt
nature / god stirs him to vttre those secret sores, not that god made, but
that man had / by corrupting, and poisoning his nature, which god at the
beginning made good. So it is true, that god tempts noman to evil, which he
has not, but god makes him vttre the evil / which he has / and as it were,
pulls the adder out of his hoale. And who ca^ say that, that is not well, and
justly don? After this vndrestanding I take. S. James words. For I will not
make hi^ to set his head, and to ru^ne against the evident scriptures. For
who has not red these words, in the.24. of the.2. book of kings. Gods
anger increased against Israel / and he surred up David against them, to say,
go, and no^bre Israel, and Iehuda. For by that act / as it appears, David
greatly and justly offended god / and brought a sore plage upon him self / and
upon the people. For David surely would trust in the multitude of his people,
leauinge the confidence / that he ought to have had in God only. Therefore the
scripture says, that god stirred him to nombre his people / to make his
nawghtie distrust in god known, and to punish the people which had offended
him with otheir sins. Howbeit god was not the author / and worcker of Dauides
distrust, nor of the peoples sin / but moved David to show forth that /
whereby all the world might se, that god justly punished him. Again we have in
the 12. of the.2. book of kings, these words. Behold, says god, by the
prophet Nathan, to David after he had committed abominable adultery, and
slain innocent Vrie, I stir up evil upon the, out of thine own house, and I
will take thy wives in thy sight, and deliver them to thy neighbor, and he shall
lie with thy wives / in the sight of this sun. For thou have wrought in
secret, but I will do this thing before al Israel and Now though it ca^me to
pass by gods ordinance, that Absolo^ lay openly with Dauides wives, yet it
is plain, that god wrought not in Absalom that vile adulterous mind, but used
that nawghtie mind, that Absalom had, to punish Dauides shameful adultery,
and murder. Touching the second matter, that god tempts no man to
everlasting damnation, some allege the prophet Ezechiel, where god says. I
will not the death of a sinner, but rather that he shall turn, and live. And. S.
Paul to Timothee. God will have al men to be saved.

To these scriptures, this is mine answer. Where god says in Ezech. that he
will not the death of a sinner, we must vndrestand it of those sinners, whom he
has chosen before the beginning of the world to be converted, and to live.
For it is evident by. S. Paul that god has some vessels of wrath, ordained to
destruction, and therefore he gives the^ up for ever to wallow in their
sins, and in them punishes one sin with another. If any man think it
unjust, that god should ordain some to destruction, and punish sin with sin
let hi^ show, that they were not worthy / to be ordained to destruction, and
to be so punished. God than will not the life, and conversion of those, whom he
has appointed to destruction. For than his will should be against his own
decree. Wherefore, as I said, we must vndrestand, that he wills the life, and
conversion of them, whom he has appointed to salvation / and of none other.
For when saint Luke says / that as many believed; as were appointed to
everlasting life / he teaches thereby, that the rest, which believed not, were
never appointed to euerlastinga life. And who can say / that it is gods will
to save any / besides his own appointment? If any man will take these words,
god wills not the death of a sinner, for god delights not simply and
absolutely in the death of a sinner, but for a certain respect / the hebrew
word, kaphets, which Ezechiel uses is, shall favor and help their
vndresta^di^g. I know i^ deed what manner of objection some rauinge unlearned
spirits make against this vndrestanding / but it may be as soon confuted / as
rehearsed. For they say, that god wills nothing, wherein he delights not.
For will say they, being a power of the mind, which has her free worcking in
choosing, and desiring / or in refusing, and not willing, wills nothing but
that wherein it delights. These seely souls can not make a difference
between willing of a thing for it self, and willinge of a thing for a
certain purpose, and not for it self.

If their saying were true, men in a tempest might not cast their goods in to
the sea, for saving of their own lives, onles they delighted in the loss of
their goods. Judges might not will thieves to be hanged / onles they delighted
in their hanginge, and so the first poor men should be very noddies and al
judges plain murderers. Yea so they affirm that god cold have no will that
his son should be tormented, onles he delighted in his torment. And than they
say either / that Christ was crucified whether God would or no / and against his
decreed will and ordinance, or else they assign to god, that I abhor to vttre
for the falsnes of it, and abomination. But we will combre our selves no farther
with such dotinges, of brainsicke men.

Touching the words of Ezechiel they may be also shortly thus vndrestanded,
that gods will is not / that any sinner converted / and repentant / shall die.
Where Saint Paul says, that god will al men to be saved, he fights not
against himself, but means that god has chosen some of al sorts, and
states, whom he will bring to the knowledge of his truth.

But because we can not know certainly which they be, S. Paul bids us pray
for all sorts of men, for kings / and noble men, which yet seem farthiest from
god, and godliness. For god among al sorts of men, has some whom he will save.
And this is no new exposition / though new men use it. For this is an old
worn, and well known sentence. Distributio est, non pro singulis generum, sed
pro generibus singulorum, quia de qualibet condition hominum aliquos
predestinauit ad vitam. Which words teach / that gods will is to appointe to
life, and save some of every sort, and condition, and not every one of al
sorts and conditions. And surely it is mere madness, to say, that god will save
more, than his son would pray for. The words of his son / whose will
agrees with the fathers in all things, ar well known. I pray not for the
world, says he, but for those, whom thou have given me. Why it is not gods
will / to save al, I know not thoroughly / that it is not his will I know, and I
know that whom soever he condemns, he condemns justly. And herein I appeal
to the consciences of al men. For no man living in the world, can avoid, but
that he shall be constrained to grant, that there is in him most just matter,
and most just causes of damnation. For all men ar defiled with sin, and sin
was not in them by their creation, but they pulled it upon them, and wrought it
in them selves, declining from their first state. So al men ar worthy, to be
left in the puddel of the filthy sins wherein they have willingly drouned
them selves, and in the end to be damned. And so god is just, if he give them
over in this life to the wickedness, whereof the very cause, and root is in
them selves, by their own procurement, and if he appoint them to everlasting
punishment after this life, which they have justly deserved thorough their
manifold horrible offenses. Now I would tarry you no longer, sauinge that as
often as we speak of this matter / rude men rush in / and think to root up
al with their twifold snouttes. For if it be so that, god has al ready
foreappointed whom he will save, and who^ he will condemn, than say they,
preachinges and exhortations be vain, and superfluous, and it stilleth not how
men live. For the reprobate can no way be saved, and the chosen can no way be
damned.

Hereunto the godly shall answer, first that it is not superfluous to preach
to the reprobate / for thereby their damnation is made iuster, and they ar
driven farther from al excuse. And to the chosen it is right fruteful. For
thereby it pleases god to awake their slepie sluggishnes, and to quicke^ their
dull me^bres. For god worcketh two ways in them, by his spirit within, and by
his word without. By his spirit he lighteneth their darcke minds / and new
frames their crooked hertes. By his word he spurreth them forewarde / and
inflameth them to desire, and to seek newnes of life. If than god will use his
word as an instrument, when he will show the efficacy, and mighty worckinge
of his hand, with what face can any man say, that preaching is superfluous to
the chosen? If god will that way prepare them to his farther worcking in them /
shall any man forbid him, to use the mean / that seems good to him?
Secondly / where they say, that it shall not skill how men live, we will desire
them to understand / that the reprobate, thorough their wicked life, and
heaping of sin upon sin make their damnation and torment more grievous. And
as for the chosen they findie not in deed to live well, that they may wi^ne
heaven, but they study to live well, because heaven is already theirs. They
labor not to make the^ selves gods children thorough good worckes, but
because they be gods children therefore they work well. They say not
because we are already saved, we will do not good works, but they say, because
we are saved therefore we will study to do good worckes, and to show our selves
thanckeful to him / who of his only mercy has saved us. For they know that
they ar appoi^ted to gods ki^gdome, and saved to this e^de, that they should
glorify their heavenly father thorough good works, and be fashioned after
the image of his son, and not to wallow themselves in filthy lusts, but to
live in puritee, and holiness before god their saueor, who renueth, and
reformeth al those with his holy spirit, whom he has foreordained to enioie
his kingdom everlastingly. Wherefore these wild bores wear their tuskes
inuaine against this adama^t, which may be hitte, but never hurt. This much I
had to say to you at this time, give god the glory. Amen.

This note,.i., stands for, that is to say. In the end of the.2. reading
for, let say, read / let us say.
