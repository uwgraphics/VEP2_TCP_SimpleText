this purpose (because that Ptholomeus i^ this manner write) that one Eclipse
gives theffect of his influence after the poynct paste of the Eclipse: this is
no less / but a thing contrary to natural reason. Dei by gratia. An eclipse
is to compare to two men / that comes one ayenft an other: thretenynge and
lokynge the one upon the other with evil and angry lokes / this hanging than
