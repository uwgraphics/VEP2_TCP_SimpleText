brother of Syon Richard Whytforde.

Unto the devout reders.
IN our lord god, and most sweet savior Jesus salutacyon. This little tretie,
or draght of death, did I write more then.xx. years ago / at the request of the
reuere^de Mother Dame Elizabeth Gybs / whom Jesus perdon / the^ Abbes of Syon.
And by the often calling upon / and remembrance of certain of her devout
systers. And now of late I have been compelled (by the charytable instance and
request of diverse devout persons) to write it again and again. And because
that writing unto me is very tedyouse: I thought better to put it in print /
whereunto I was the rather moved / that I perceived by the prynters: you have
thankfully taken such other poor labors: as we before have send forth. Read
this I pray you ones over and after as you like it is but very short: and
therefore have I not divided it into chapytours: but only into.ii. parts. In
the first part whereof is entreated of the fere / or dread of death to be
excluded, exiled, and utterly put away. In the.ii. part is put forth. The
daily exercise and experyence of death.

Of the daily exercise of death the first part, which is of the fear or dread
of death / to be excluded, exyled and to utterly be put away.
Reverend Mother, and good devout sisters: you have (many and oftentimes with
great instance) required me to write unto you some breue / or short lesson of
death, and how you should prepare and ordeyne your self daily thereunto. This
lesson is very short and plain after saint Augustine: De te^pore sermon. ii. c.
xxxix.
for he says, the lest lesson and the best mean to dye well: is well to live.
For who so well lives (says he) may not evil dye. Then done, we learn to
dye well / when we learn well to live / and that lesson can you teache me better
tha^ I you. For you have longer used the craft: and given more dilyge^ce
thereunto. Notwithstanding somewhat in part to satisfye your devout minds:
somewhat / after our poor understanding: shall we say. But first (as seems
unto me) it is necessary and spedefull that we enforce and give dilygence to
avoid, exclude, exyle, and put far away: that chyldyssh vain and folyssh
fear, and dread of death, that many persons have: for doubtless it is both
vain and folly: to fear and dread that thing: that by no mean, may be
avoided and yet some persons ben so a frayde of death / that they shrugge,
tremble and quake, when they here speak thereof: and run or depart out of
company / because they will not here tell of death. And to excuse their folly
they take auctoryte of Aristotle the great Philosophour: iii. Ethicoru^. ca. i.
tra ii. M. xxvi. d. Mar. iiii. d. L. xxii. T ii. Co. v. a.
that says: that of al terryble things, death is most terryble / and over
that our savior before his passion, was afraid of death, and naturally did
abhor it: for ye pain thereof. Saint Paul says also / yt we would not be
spoiled of our bodies / and yet would we have the clothing of immortalyte upon
which / and upon like auctorytes they conclude that death is peynfull, and
therefore to be feared and dred. For declaracyon hereof: you must understand
that the dread of death may be taken.ii. ways, for.ii. causes / one for the
pain that is in the departing of the soul / and the body by death. And an
other way / or cause: for the vncertente of the hour of death and of the state
of ye person in that hour, or time. This fear and dread of death should every
person have every hour. But as unto the first fear that is for the dread of
ye pain in death, that fear is vain. For in death is no pain, or right little
to be feared / as after we shall show. Arystotle says in deed: Vbi su.
that death is terryble and fearful / but that is unto them alone (says he)
that doubt of any other life after this present life. cause in all things: the
appetyte and desire to be continued and to endure: and last for ever / and
thereunto death infors as much as nature may / other in them self or in their
fruit and kind. But thereof does not follow that any pain is in death: ne any
fear or dread to be takyn therefore. As by example of trees and fruits as well
as of sensyble bestes. The trees when they wexe old, don naturally put forth
new sprynges from the rote: and the fruits: when they be grene and young: will
not depart from the tree: nor the seeds from the herb / or grain, except
vyolence: but when they ben full ripe / then will they naturally of them self
/ and by them self depart without any vyolence. So is it in man: after a like
manner: that when the person is in nature young: grene, lusty, and strong / and
in the body conformyte / and like state of complexcyons: death is then horrible
hugsum, and fearful unto the person because it is then vyolent. But when the
person is full ripe: that is to say / worn by age, or sekenes, unto the point
of death. Then is not death unto that person, any thing loathsome, fearful, ne
peyneful / but rather sweet, pleasant, and desirous: and so says Arystotle in
his book of natural philosophye. Phi. v.
Mors senum, dulcis est. Iuuenum vero: violenta. The death of aged persons
(says he) is sweet and pleasant / but the death of young persons: is
vyolent and grievous / yet say I: that the fear is not for the pain of death in
departing of the soul. For then is no pain / but all the pain is in the
sekenes disease / and affliccyon before death. For the persons that (as I
said) ben worn or wasted unto the point: done dye, and depart this life:
not only without sorrow or pain: but also with gladness, swetnes, and pleasure.
And so says ye same philosophour Arystotle in an other book. Aristot. de vita
and morte. and Cicero.i. Tusc.
And so does also an other great philosophoure / and learned Tullie. And I
dare well say, that in death is less pain unto such persons: then is in the
prycke of a pynne, or nedyll unto a whole person. The fear than that our
saui-had before his passion / was not for the pain of death: but it was of the
fraylte of our nature in his carnal flesshely part for the pains that he
knew well should precede / and go before death. And ye pain does our
sensualyte / and our carnal part / always abhor / and fear naturally: all
though in some persons more / and some less. For you may se in experyence /
that some persons ben ready to swone or talme / if they se an other person
sore wounded / blede, or put unto great peynes / and some done shake for fear
/ wha^ they here tell how some other persons shall be racked, and streyned.
And some persons will abhor to look upon the instruments, or ingyns of
tourmentrye: as children when they se the rod, or whyppe. Death therefore is
not to be feared / nor dredde for any pain that is therein. Many done dye, and
depart this life: not only (as we said) without pain / but also with desire,
and pleasure. Which thing we have before, Probacy on by reason.
proved by auctoryte / and good reason / will conclude the same. For if pain
be in death / that pain must nedely be / other in the body, or in the soul.
But in the body (at the point of death) is no pain. For than ben all the
senses and wits of the body: whereby he should feale pain or pleasure / gone
and departed: and the body than in such case (as for fealynge pain) as when
it is full deed. And as unto ye soul / death is not peynefull but rather
pleasant, and joyful / as a person that long had been in prison / and then were
suddenly loused and put at lyberte. De bono mortis.
For (as saint Ambrose says. The soul is in prison / while it is in the body,
and therefore is it glad to be delivered by death. And to say trothe, when the
point of death approaches and draws nere both the parts (in manner) ben glad
to deperte in sou^dre / that is to say, Marowse they call in the cou^te^.ii.
housba^d men that done till their land together
the soul from the body / and the body from the soul / as by example of.ii.
marowes or.ii. such persons that must need labor both together unto such
an effect / and purpose / as can not come to pas and be fulfilled by one of
them alone / then at night, or when their purpose is ended, they ben glad,
where the tone is not able theru^to alone without help
to depart unto their own propre whomes, logynges and places. So is it of the
soul, and the body / that here as.ii. marowse or mates done labor to gether
as in an exyle or strange country (for as saint Paul says) non habemus hic
ciuitatem manentem / we have not here (says he) any city or dwelling place /
and when that labor of them both to gether has fulfilled the course of
nature unto the periode / and point assygned of god / than done they gladly
depart eueryche toward his propre whom / that is, the body unto the earth,
from whens it came. Gene. iii. d.
And the soul unto heuyn / except it be let with any sin, which may never
enter into heaven. Thus have we proved unto you both by auctoryte and by reason
/ that in death is no pain, and so that no fear should be taken of any, or for
any such pain. yet shall I go forther, and prove ye same by experyence.
Probacyon by experyence
For lady experyence has showed oftymes / unto many persons, that in death is
no pain. For some persons have been in trance / that for the time have had a
large experyence of death / when the body was so desolate of the soul / yt the
body felt nothing ne any thing perceived by any of the senses, or wits /
and yet has the soul (in the same time) seen / and perceived the state of
heaven, hell, or any other place. ii. Cor. xii. a.
Saint Paul was so in such rapte / yt he could not tell him self whether
the soul was in his body, or not. And that was a large and nere experyence of
death / but yet another he, ne any of those so takyn in trau^ce, or rapt / have
made any mencyon of any pain in their rapte: ergo there is no pain in death.
Swonynge also or talmynge / is (in manner) a death / sith the body (for that
time) is destytute / and void of all the wits and some in such swones,
talmes, done expyre, dye, and depart this life. yet those that done suruyue /
recover, and live again / done euydently show what pain they had, or suffered
/ that so departed in their swone, or talme / but they confess / and say
plainly: they felt no manner of pain / but rather a great ease of all peynes:
ergo in death is no pain. Some persons also have expyred and dyed slepynge
(which I doubt not) should have been waked, if a pynne or a nedell had been
thraste, or put through their ears or if fire had brent their finger / ergo no
pain in death. Let us yet go unto a forther experyence of death. Io. xi. d.
Lazare brother to Magdalene and Martha (as the Gospel sheweh) was deed.iiii.
days, and yet raised by our savior (and many have been raised by miracle. I
knew, and spoke with one such my self. But nothing have I herd / or read
of any pain that any of them suffer in death / ergo, no pain in death, Amb. de
bonomo^tis and.ii.li. de Cain et Abel. cap. x.
and so does saint Ambrose plainly / affyrm in a book that he wrote of the
goodness and profit of death. The fear (says he) that the frail persons
have of death / is rather by ye opinyon that they conceive of death / then for
the self death. Because they have seen, or herd tell of many great pains,
syckenesses, and passions yt many done suffer before their death / and that
causes their frail flesh to abhor, De bona mortis. cap. viii.
and to loathe death / because of those peynes and greues. And specially such
persons as have a love inordynate unto the vain pleasures of this present
life. And those also, that i^ a whole body, have a sick soul / and foiled
conscience and most done they fear death, that halte and ben faynte in the
faith. And no marvel though such manner of persons do fear, In tusvbi sup.
and dread death. For (as ye learned Cicero says) if their life had nothing
committed ne done / that were to be feared, they should of death have no dread:
wise men done fear sin, which is the act / and deed of quycke, and not of
deed persons. De bono mortis. vt supra.
We should (says saint Ambrose) fear and dread our life / the acts and deeds
whereof, done appertain and belong unto our self / and ben i^ our own power
and at our own will / and not fear death yt is another in our will, ne power.
For whether we will or not: that is / will we, nyll we expire / and dye /
nedely we must. De remedis for^u it coru and Cice. vbi supra.
Than (as we said before) as the wise man Seneke says / it is great folly to
fear and dread that thing / that by no mean may be escaped ne avoided. And
who so ever will remain in such fear or dread, Cicero vbi sup.
shall never live in quietude and rest of mind. Wise men says Cicero / done
not fear death / but rather done they contemn, dispyse death / and set naught
thereby / which thing doutbles, does much avail, profet, In tusc. vbi sup.
comfort, and strength any person when so ever death shall approach, draw nere,
and hap unto him / specially if he be a feythfull christyane. Cicero vbi sup.
For who so ever not only because death is necessary, and can not be avoided /
but also because that in death is nothing to be feared / does dispyse and set
naught by death / that person / says he / shall for a surete have a great
succoure and help, here to live quietly / and when the time shall come, to
receive death gladly / and after this present life joyfully to live / and
blessedlye.

Note here how great courage and conforte this pagane gives men, to dispyse /
and nothing to fear death. Well sir, say you / this is soon said, or soon
spoken. But yet is not death so soon dispysed / ne so lightly set at naught.
For we se, and behold many men / that should have strong hertes, and more
boldness than we women, and such also that been taken, and supposed for wise and
well learned men / that been much affrayde of death. Ah good systers / you must
consydre and call unto mind / that men ben made of the same metal, that women
ben / and yt among them some ben as feynte herted as women / and therefore take
no head unto them. Cicero i^ tuscu. vt supra.
For although a bold and hardye heart do much help unto the contempt, and
dispisynge of death / yet may you by the examples and counsels of holy fathers
/ engender and make in your self a more strong boldness and hardynesse
spirytuall thereunto / and specially by conforte and counsel of holy scripture
/ which, as a phisicyon, does cure ye feynt and feeble hertes, withdraws all
vain and frutles cures and cares / and delyuereth the frail heart / from the
delectable poison of all worldly and flesshely pleasures / and so puts away
all fear and dread. Vbi sup.
Reason also, as they said Cicero says, does not little avail unto the
co^tempte of death, which as it were by certain precepts, or reules does
confirm / and reyse up the feynt cowardouse heart. But above and beyond all
things, whole and pure faith, strong and steadfast hope and perfect fervent
charity / done most help thereunto. For these do not only exyle, exclude,
and put away all fear and dread of death with the most high contempt
thereof / but also done ingendre and get a fervent covetous desire of death.
Philip. 1.c.
Saint Paul unto wytnes saying. Cupio dissolui, et essem cu^ Christo / I
covet, says he, and desire / to be dissolved and departed from this life, to
be with Christ / for faith does teache, assure, and give certain knowledge
of an other life to come after this life which shall be more pleasant without
co^paracyon, than this life is. For to say troth in this life is no manner of
pleasure, Amb. lib. ii. de. Cai^ ^t Abel. ^api. x. Augusti. Catho.
without some manner of passion or pain going before, or following after. And
therefore saint Augustyne sayet / it should rather be called a death than a life
/ and contrary this death should be called life / because it is the end of all
dethes (yt is to say) the end of al myseryes / all sorrows, all syckenesses,
all diseases, all troubles / all pains which in them self ben dethes.
^mbrosi s de b o ^o mortis. capi-viii. et. Boethius de coosolatione. i. i. Cor.
xv
And also because it is not only ye end of all euylles / but also the
beginning of all that is good as of all felicyte, joy, gladness, co^forth, and
pleasure / and of life everlasting. For as by this wretched life is one
passage unto death / so by this death / is our return unto life / for if we
should never expyre and dye / we should never rise to life again. And if we
never rise, we should never be rewarded in our bodies / for ye great miseryes
and pains that we done here suffer in them for the love of god. i. Cor. xv
And if that were true / than were we, as saint Paul says / in more
miserable state, and in wors case than any other people. But our faith does
make us sure and certain of resurrection, where we say. Carnis resurrectionem
/ that is to say, I believe the resurrexion of our flesh and bodies / as in
our commune Creed. Hope also does help much unto the dispysyng of death. For
when a person has full faith that god may and can do all that he will / and
that he is of such goodness that he does love us all: than does hope follow
that faith / and so does verily trust and believe to have (after or in the
said resurrexion) everlasting reward, and that reward shall be good and
pleasant, ioyouse and confortable. It shall be a great reward, as much as
may be desired or given / it shall be all god him self. And this reward than
must nedely cause a great love, that is charity, and very charity / and love
does not only dispyse death / but also causes a fervent desire thereof. Here
some perso^es done say sir / if we were cert^^ and sure of that reward after
(...) death / we should set little by death, and be content and glad to depart:
whereunto I say, that all we may be sure thereof, if we will our self. For our
lord has freely given us that grace, Augusti.
that we may will and so willing and disposynge our self thereunto: he may not
of justice / ne will of his goodness withholde it from us. Diuus Thoma. i. sent.
That reward tha^ he ordained and promised unto them that love him / and done
work there after. Well sir say you, it is hard so well to work in this life
/ that we may come unto that reward without pain, after this life: and that
pain is it / that fears us more, than does the pain of death / and causes
us to be so loathe to dye, and depart hens. For we would live longer to amend
our life, and to do penance to avoid or (at the least) to minysshe and make
less that pain. Unto this I say true penance done for the love of god / may
as well in short time as in long, avoid or minysshe that pain / as is
euydent in him that hang by our savior on the cross unto whom he said.
Hodie mecum eris in Paradiso. This day shall thou be with me in paradyse: it is
than another the long time: nor the short: nor yet the penance that does put
away: or make less that pain of it self: but the love of god / for whose
sake that penance is done, and that love may be in a person feruente in
short time as well as in long / and all the penance that is done, Grego.
probatio a mortis.
is nothing but a proof of that love / and so as long as we bide in this
corruptyble sorry body we must love / and ever prove that love by contynuall
penance and good works forsakynge all sin. For else is all the penance and
the works void and lost. But yet follows not thereof that we should desire
long life ne short, but as he will. For to give unto god freely, fully, and
holly our will / so that we have no will but his, is the greattest gift yt we
can give unto god, and the thing yt he chefely requires and desires of us /
for he does not desire our affliction ne penance / but give me says he thine
heart: and that suffyseth me. Than so to give unto him ye thing yt he first
gave freely unto us: that is fre will, is yt thing that may best avoid or make
less that pain. And so to say, think, and will that if he would have us
longer in pain / we should consent and will so to be / and yet forther, we
should rather choose and desire pain perpetual after his will: tha^ joy
everlasting, contrary unto his will. And this will may be had i^ few years and
shore time. To will than, Marcu. trism^g. ad E^^l^ pium.
and to desire to be with god / by long or short pain or without any pain,
as best shall please his gracyous goodness / is the best mean, next remedy
and most sure way to avoid, fle, and to minysshe pain / and in that will
(without fear, and dread of death / or rather dispysynge death) to tarry, bide /
and in every thing to suffer his will and pleasure / ever ready for death, and
lokynge every hour for death, with fervent desire / and wysshe to be with him,
and to abide here / for nothing, but only for him / so yt he be (as saint
Paul says) all our life / and death (for his sake) be unto us lucre, Phil. i.
gaynes, winning and advantage. The pagane Cicero says, In Tus.
that a wise man will never fear death. The reason why is: that death by reason
of uncertain chau^ces, does daily and hourly fall happy, and suddenly come
unto every sort / degree, and manner of ages / and also because of the shortness
of our life, death can not be long absent from us. For (as saint Ambrose
says) we may be in certente: that if we live very long: yet shall we dye
shortly. De bono mortis. ca. i. and ix.
For the longest of our lives, is very short / and specially, if we compare it
unto the long life of eternite: than is it nothing not so much: as one mote
unto the whole earth / yet the commune people, when a young person departs
does say: oh alas, Vbi su.
it is pytie that such a person should dye thus, and depart before his time /
but hereunto he does answer. Before the time, says he / what time done they
mean? other that time that they would set and desire: or else that time that
god has determined and appointed? If they mean their time, I will not
dispute ne reason with them. But if they mean gods time / than will I say /
that almyghtye god does not give life unto any person for ever / as his own
thing: but rather does lend it. As debt to be paid, wha^ so ever it shall be
axed, and not at any certain day appointed / and as the detter may use the
debt so lent, while he has it / and yet has no wrong, although it be axed
sooner than he would, or yet than he supposed. So in like manner god has lent
every person life, but he poynted no day when he will axe and have it again /
and that he did because he would that man should be always ready to pay, when so
ever he were called upon. How than may any person complain or grudge, wha^ so
ever he is taken by death / sith he received life by that condicyon. yet sir
said they / the credytour and lender is called hard, that calls for the
debt before the borower have any gaynes, or profet thereof / and so done we
think that god deals hardely with the young persons / because he takes
their life, before they have any pleasure thereof. Hereto now (say I) they
done suppose (by error) that is nothing true / that is, that in this life
should be pleasure / which in very deed well considered, is contrary (that is
to say) displeasure, pain, misery, woe, and death. And therefore those persons
that come to death in their youth / ben much bound to thank our lord: that
has delivered the^ from those incommodytes and miseryes, that they should have
had and suffered in longer living. And here the common people suppose an other
great error, that is / yt long life should be good and pleasant, where in
deed long life takes away all manner of goods and pleasures of this life /
that is to say, the goods of fortune / as lands, possessions, gold, silver,
and other goods, and cattle. For age in long life spends all / and gets
nothing. It takes away also the senses and wits of man / as hearing,
Cicero vbi sup
sight, smelling, tastynge, and touching / with the other goods of nature: as
youth, strength, beauty, and agilyte / nymlesse and quickenes. And yet the
goods that been more precious and dear than al these: that is to say, memory,
and remembrance / reason and understanding, conning, and knowledge / and
makes many times the will froward. And does render and make whole man, both
in soul and body: full dull in devotion and in all manner of goodness and
virtue, wherefore the wysman said. Ec. vi. b.
Better is he and more happy that dies at the mothers womb forthwith after
his birth / than is he yt lives long. No person therefore of any age has
wrong by death for every person (by ye law of syn^e) is in the first day of
birth, or rather in the first day of life mortal and subdued unto death / and
in the first day of life, every person begins to dye. Augusti.
And therefore is it not again the law for any person to dye at any time,
young or old. Let us therefore (good devout chrystyanes) put clean away and
utterly exyle this frail and falls opinyon of death / and let us think verily,
and believe / that in death is no wrong, but all right: no pain, but great
pleasure, In tus. vbi sup.
all good and nothing evil. For (as the oftsayde Cicero says) how may that
thing be unto any person evil, and hurt? that almighty god has ordained unto
all persons indifferentlye / for their good and profet: and as the end of all
euyles? Good lord, tha^ how curragyously and gladly should that journey and
voyage be interprysed and taken / which ones made and finysshed no care, ne
woo / no thought ne busynes / no turmoyle, ne trouble, no strife ne debate / no
pain, ne disease / no vexacyon, ne displeasure may remain ne follow but unto
them that well hope / shall well hap / what time so ever they go. But yet ben
they most happy / and gracious, that (in state of salvation) done dye, and
depart this life, in their youth / and strength. For unto them (immedyately
after their death, must nedely follow one of these twain (that is) that they
must go straight way unto heuyn: or else unto pain. If they go unto pain /
than the sooner they dye / and the shorter time they live: the less there, and
the shorter time shall be their pain. And over that they shall have the
greattest comforde that any creature may have being out of heuyn. For the
which comforde to be had: any faithful person would be glad to suffer any
manner of most cruel and horrible pain or passion (that is to say) surety of
salvation. Sa^ctus Thoma. iiii. sent. di. xv. q..iii. ar. l.
For all ye souls being in pain ben co^munely sure, and certain of their
salvation, that wha^ their penance is paste, and their sins purged / they
know for certente they shall go into heaven unto everlasting joy and comfort.
But remember that I said / they ben communely sure and certain of salvation.
For it may be, ye some one, or few souls have not that knowledge / but that
god (for some special offense / and for a special pain and punysshement
thereof) does hyde, and keep that knowledge from them, as we have in the
reuelacyons of our holy mother saint Byrget. And that pain is more alone,
tha^ all the pains of the other souls. For that sure knowledge of salvation,
Live. vi. c. xxxix. ^.
is unto them a synguler confort in all pains, and does cause them to suffer
ye pains with good will in ye charity of our lord: glad to suffer much more
at his gracyous will and pleasure. If those that depart this life, go straight
unto heuyn: than ben they far more happy that from the miseryes of this
wretched world: they be come unto the pleasant possession of so great
unspeakable joy. For you may be sure it is an excellent joy, to be there in
company with the pure virgynes, the holy confessors / the glorious martyrs /
divine apostles, sage patryarches / bright shynynge angels / and the virgyn
mother our blessed Lady, and all these to se and behold with our reverend
lord, and sovereign savior Jesus Christ / And all before the presence of the
blessed Trinyte / father son and holy ghost, there prayenge all for us, and
lowly besechinge yt high mageste eterne, and everlasting god. For all ma^kynd I
think and verily believe yt any faithful christian, would be glad to expire and
suffer death every day newely / if it were possible, and oftimes in ye day, so
he were sure yt he thereby might atteyne and come unto ye pleasure / why tha^
(now I speak with stomach) why for shame, should we as cowardes or children fere
and dread death? specially since death is nothing, but like unto a sleep. For ye
old philosophours said yt sleep was a very image of death: and as one man may
know an other by his image although he had never se ne hi^ before: ii. Mac.
xii. Ioha^. xi. Job.
so may we know what death is by ye image, which is sleep: and so is it called
also i^ scripture i^ diverse places, and our savior him self said: ye lazarus
slept wha^ he was ded / and death also is called a shadow / but you perceive well
and se, yt folks be^ not afraid of a shadow, nor yet of step another. For
oftimes we sleep with our fear or dread, and without any pain or grefe / but
rather with desire and pleasure / why should we than fear death sith we so
euyde^tly done ^e and per^eyue by the image how little death is to be dread /
let us therefore put away this opinyonatyue fear and dread of death / and sith
it does daily approach and wait for us: let us again with glad mind and
redye good will, abide and wait for it, and have thereof a thurst and a desire
/ rather than any fear or dread: how be it (of a suretye) death is than lest
feared and most desired: when ye life of the person / may (at the time of
death) be of sure and unfeigned godly friends / conforted with the true
testymonye and praise of virtue / wherefore (good devout chrystynes) although
your reason and learning be not sufficyent to cause or to persuade you /
utterly to dispyse death / yet let your well spente life and clear conscience,
perform and so satisfy you that you be persuaded: and verily believe as a
trothe euydent and opyn unto you / that to live longer were more miserye / and
that your life has be verey long or rather ouerlonge. If it had pleased our
lord: before and erste to have called you. Thus now (good Chrystianes) let us
without any care of death, leave the carnal mourning, and waylynge thereof /
unto our suruyuyng friends / that with lamentacyon / and shall inteere and burye
our bodies. And let us take an other manner of care and dilygence / to prepare,
apparel, and to order our self unto that thing yt we know well, no person
shall avoid nor escape / byleuynge and trustyng verily, that he that made us
of naught / and when we were lost, would so derely bye us again / will not
suffer us to dye. But rather (as I said before) to change this wretched life,
for an other more precious and joyful / and only to be desired. All this
hitherto have I said to the intent that you should exyle, exclude, and put
away far from you, the commune fear full fantasye of the odious opinyon of
death / and somewhat to ingendre, and bylde in you a contrary opinyon. A
covetous desire to be with our lord. Amen.

Now shall follow the second part of this interpryse / of the daily exercise
and experyence of death.
Of the exercise and experyence of death. The second part of this interpryse.
FIrst you must know, what is exercise / and what is experynce / and how by
them you may come unto the knowledge of death. An exercise (than) is an act
deed and an use of workynge or laboring. Than done you exercise virtue,
Defini. of exercice.
when you put it unto use and workyng thereof, and the exercise of death / is the
act and use of the workyng thereof. Defini. of experyence. i. Meth.
Experyence is a knowledge that without any master or techer is found out and
gotyn, by exercise and use. Ibidem.
And by many experyences says Aristotle art / craft or conning is
engendered and gotyn, so yt experience (as he says) does appertain and by long
proprely unto singular persons and art craft or co^nyng unto al perso^es. And
although that artcraft or connyng yt is called speculatyue may be had by
lerning of a techer, or by dylygent study / yet this art or craft that we
speak of here must nedely be had, by experyence / and experyence, by exercise
and use. So that if you will have the actyue knowledge of death / by the art
and craft thereof, you must begin first at exercise and use. And yet can no
man put a thing unto exercise / without some introduction and leadynge
thereunto / other by techynge, study, or natural disposicyon. you must than
know first what the thing is that you shall put in exercise / and so to have
experyence, and knowledge thereof (yt is to say) you must know what death is /
or what is meant by this term, or word death. For the self term death does
signifye / and is taken dyuersly i^ diverse manners Sometime death is taken, and
called a change of life. So the common people done often use it, as when they
say of a deed person / he is not deed (say they) out he has changed his life
/ and so does saint Ambrose say, as we showed before. De bono mortis.
And yet change of life is called death in diverse other manners. As when a
person does fall by sin from good life unto the state of damnacyon or
contrary / when he does arise by grace from sin unto the state of salvation.
To. vi. ^,
Saint Paul does show both unto the Romans / as wha^ he says that in
our baptysme we ben buried with Christ unto death from sin / and we believe we
shall arise again with Christ unto a new life of grace. Romans i. ^
And for the the other part he says, that occasyon has deceived the frail
person / and so has slain him, and brought him to death. This change of life
is, Augusti.
that spirytuall death / that (as saint Augustyne says) does depart god from
the soul. For god is the life of the soul / and when god than is (by syn^e)
departed there from, the soul is deed. And this is the death only to be feared
and abhorred / as the worste death of all dethes / and yet to say truth,
there is none other death evil / except only that death that must nedely
follow this death / that is to say, the death of both body and soul eterne and
everlasting damnacyon. The other manner of death: that I spoke of / that is: the
change of evil life unto good / Romans vl.
and of the which (as I said) saint Paul wrote unto ye Romans: is a good
death / which you and every faithful person have exercysed and often put in
use, by reason of the holy sacraments. And when need shall require, ben ready so
to do / when I speak here of evil life to be changed: I mean not the state
only of mortal or deedly sin. For many persons, that often done use the
sacraments / done live without any deedly sin / but I mean the life spotted
with any vice or sin. Mercu. trismeg.
For a great clerk says. Omne ^onu^ nostru^, mixtum est cu^ malo. Every
thing good that is ours / and does appertain unto us, is mixed or myngled with
evil. So that our whole life, is ever mixed, coupled, and cumbred with some
vise and evil / which natwithstandynge may (by the grace of ye sacraments) be
daily purged, and so our life changed / and we thereby have ye exercise, use,
and experyence of this death. But yet is there an other manner of death called of
learned me^, meditatio mortis / that is to mean ye meditacion (that is to say)
the cogytacyon, thought and remembrance / the busynes, tractacyon or
intreatye, mencyon, and disputacyon of death. Tota vita philosophorum,
meditatio mortis est. All the whole life of philosophers: and wise men (say
they) is the co^mentacyon, remembrance, and mencyon or disputacyon of death /
often mencyon, remembrance / often disputacyon, and discussyon of any thing does
cause it to be the better known. Cicero. Macer. libro. i. de somno Sipio^is.
Eras. in Enchr.
And men co^munely will make often mention, speak, and talk often of that thing
whereunto they have desire, love, or have good mind and affection. And
contrary they will not here tell of that thing that they hate, and love not:
and so is it of many persons that will not here speak, ne any mencyon made of
death. And if (by chance) any mencyon be made of death again their minds and
wylles / they will lift up the hand and bless them, or else murmr out
softly: some supersticyous prayers as though they hard speak of the devil /
or of some abhomynable and cruel deed. And certainly it is no marvel though
such persons be affrayde to dye, and loathe thereunto / because they be not
acquoynted with death, nor be exercysed there in. But as (in case) a person ye
long time had layne fetred in prysone / could not for lack of exercise go
fast, ne run when he were newly put unto lyberte / so these manner of
persons, wrapped in the world / and fetred in ye flesh / can not quyckely
and couragyouslye for lack of experyence: walk the way of death, which
natwithsta^dyng they must nedely trede / and pass whether they will or no.
Lack (I say) of exercise use, and experyence / causes these persons to fear
and dread death. As by example, children and some women, or such persons never
had experience ne knowledge of a bugge that is a personage, that in play does
represent the devil at ye first sight / ben much affrayde thereof: in so much
that some persons have been in ieoperdye to lose their wit and reason thereby.
But wha^ they afterward have knowledge what it was and by use have experience
thereof: they ben than nothing affrayde thereof, but rather done take pleasure
there in. So is it of them yt have not the experience of death / because they
will not take, but rather will they fle / and avoid / ye use and exercise
thereof. But and if they knew what / and how great profet there is in ye
exercise / meditacyon and often record: and remembrance of death: they would
not fle nor avoid it: but rather with study and diligence give and apply
them self daily thereunto. Ec. i. d. Psalmus. xxxviii.
The wysema^ says. Fili memorare nouissima tua. etc. In all thy works sone
(says he) remember thy last end / and thou shalt never offend god. The
prophet therefore prayde unto our lord saying. Notum fac mihi domine finem
meum. Good lord (says he) let me have knowledge of my last end, as though
he said. Good lord give me grace that (by the daily exercise, and meditacyo^
of death) I may have an experyence and knowledge of my last end: and evermore
to be ready thereunto / according unto thy will and pleasure. Nothing is more
valiant to expel and put away sin from the soul: nor yet more profitable
to replenyssh and garnysshe the soul with good virtues: then is the daily
exercise, and meditacyon of death. But how to put and apply them self unto
that exercise, all persons can not tell. For many that feign would have and
use the meditacyon and exercise of death: have not the way, ne know any form
or fassyon thereof. And yet ben there diverse fourmes and ways thereof and all
good. For some persons: One manner of exercise of death. Tho.
done go no forther, but to remember and think that death is the pain of syn^e
inflycted, judged and appointed by almyghtye god, unto our first parents: and
therefore due and right unto all their posteryte, folowers, and of spring: so
that no man after them did ever escape death / ne never man shall, unto the day
of general judgment: and therefore sure it is that we must dye: but when or
how we can not tell. To have therefore a daily exercise of death. I shall set
you here.ii. fourmes of this exercise. An other form or manner of the exercise
of death.
The first form is this that in some conuenyent time of the day or night
appointed and chosen for this exercise: you shall ymagyne, call unto
remembrance and so set forth before the eyes and sight of your soul: how you
have seen or herd of a person that has been condemned by judgment, unto
bodily death: as to be brent, hanged, or heded, or such other. Than say or
think unto your self: what and if I were in such case: as that person was I
know well, and knowledge unto our lord: yt I have deserved more cruel death
(for every deedly sin, is worthy more pain / than any worldly pain) or else
if you were in such case as you have dremed in your sleep, or herd of dremyng
/ that you should forthwith go unto the execucyon of death, without remedy:
how than would I do / or how should I then, or were bound to do for the
salvation of my soul / or if ever you have seen or herd of the manner of them
that been nere unto their passage / and lie drawyng upon unto death. And the
people about some weeping and mournyng / some cryenge, and calling upon the
sick / to remember our lord god and our most sweet savior Jesus Christ / our
blessed lady with other holy saints. And remember how ye sick is than
co^bred with syckenes and pain: so yt he can do little for him self / all
weke, feeble, and infirm. And how than, the ghostly enemy the devil would
prese: and come in before you with a foul sort of vgsum soldiers / and
assail you in many so^dry wise / lay before you the multitude of your sins
and all your omyssyons of such good deeds as you might have done / whereof you
were neglygent, and all to bring you unto dispeyre of your salvation: and that
you should leave your faith / and have no hope ne trust of mercy. Tha^
remember what comfort it should be unto you at that time / yt you had prepared
and made ready before hand for all these matters / and how oftymes you had seen
in your soul all this conclusyon: and how often you had reasynge up your
frail heart dispysed death and nothing set thereby / and how you had appointed /
to believe yt i^ death is none evil but great good / and that you tha^ should
make an end of al mysery and shortly come unto a better state. Tha^ begin to
say unto your self. I will now i^ health study, and exercise my self with this
form: and specially how I shall answer ye lothly best ye fe^de. I will now i^
this time present: for ye time of death yt nedely shall come / left up my hands
and heart unto my lord / and beseech him of grace and succor / and tha^ will I
beseech ye good blessed lady mother of mercy: my good angel with my holy patro^s
there namyng such saints as you have in most synguler devotion: and all ye
holy saints of heaven, to be there present with me to aid, confort, and to
strength me again yt cruel best. And as unto my sins say you I have gadred
them al togeder (as far as I can remember) and brought the^ unto ye slon
there to be polysshed, rubbed, and scoured (that stone is the holy sacrament of
penance) that by the merytes of Christ's precious blood / has washed away
my sin. For I know well that one drope alone of that most holy sacred blod,
were sufficyent, and enough / and far more than enough / to wasshe and
cleanse all the sin of the world / and yet shed he all his blood every drope.
And therefore (now at this time for and instead of that time: I put ye
precious blood with his bitter passion and his most cruel / and shameful death
/ between me and all the sins that ever I did in thought, word, or deed, and
betwexe me and his wrath and displeasure. And having full faith and trust unto
his promise (that is) that he will gracyously receive all penytentes unto
mercy: I now for then boldly provoke the and deffye the most cruel and false
fend, and I straytely charge ye in his holy blessed name Jesus: that if you
have any thing to lay unto my charge: show it now: tell it out. For thou
shall another confou^de, ne fear me / nor yet disconforde me therewith / but
rather do me great pleasure to put me in remembrance.

If I have forgoten to confess any thing worthy penance / that I may now
(unto thy confusyon / show it and with the will at the lest) and desire of
perfect contricyon, and with indignacyon: I may cast it at thy face among all
the other sins yt ever I did by any means / which sins I utterly forsake,
as nothing appertaynynge unto me. For I am gracyously bathed, washed, and
cleansed in the precious blood of my sovereign savior Jesus Christ. And therefore
I bequethe and commytte all my sin, unto the cruel best / the auctor and
begynner of all sin: with the to remain from whe^s it came and whether it
shall / in the and with the eternally to be punysshed. And than leauyng him
there: turn unto our lord god, and unto our sweet savior Jesus. And as if you
were than, at the point of death / axe him hertely forgyuenes of all your
offenses / and beseech his goodness of mercy and grace, and pray ye saints (as
I said before) to pray for you, and than (if you be going unto rest, which
time is most conuenyent for this exercise) bless you thus In manus tuas
co^mendo spiritu^ meum: redemisti me domine deus veritatis. In nomine patris
and filii, and spiritus sa^cti. Amen. Making a cross with a holy candell if you
have it present, after the manner that you have / i^ your book for householders.
And thus do.iii. times together / and so go unto rest as you should go unto
your grace. This exercise (good devout souls) is not to be dispysed / for by
daily use and custom / it shall inge^dre and bylde in you a great boldness, and
hardynes. So that when so ever natural death shall approach / you shall than,
not as a woman or child, but as a very man / as a strong and mighty champyon
thus surely armed / stand styfly without fear, or dread, and little care / or
rather set naught by death / but utterly dispyse death, as every hour and time
ready thereunto. An other exercise of death.
But now we shall led you forth unto an other exercise of death more high and
excellent tha^ this / and so to have experye^ce of yt death / that more proprely
is called death / whereby you shall not only without fere or dread) dispyse
death, but also (as an hongrye person) you shall have an auidiouse and gredye
appetite to thurst and wyssh for death. And with a fervent mind, and flamynge
desire / you shall langour mourn and long for death. Saying with saint Paul.
Phi. i. c
Cupio dissolui et esse cum Christo. I couete wysshe, and will, to be dissolved
from this present life, and to be with Christ. In this exercise: you shall not
only have the experience / and the full art, science, connyng, and knowledge
of death / but also the very practyse of death / so that you shall every day
(when you will) be as verily deed / according unto the very definicyon of
death. For death (after all auctours) proprely taken is. The definicio^ and
determinacion of death.
A departing in sondre / of the soul and the body. To depart than the soul
from ye body: and to render and put either unto his propre and natural place /
is the very practyse of death. The propre and natural place or whom of the
soul, is heuyn. Whereof saint Paul says. Heb. xiii. c.
Non habemus hic ciuitatem manentem, sed aliam inquirimus: we have here (says
he) no dwelling place / but we do seek and search for an other place. Genesis iii.
c
And the natural place of the body, is ye earth / for thens it came, and
thither it must again / wha^ so ever than the soul (by dilygent study) is
occupied wholly in heavenly things / and the body left without the senses or
wits / that is without hearing, seeing, smelling, tastynge, and touching /
than is that person as deed. But that a person (for the state of this life) may
be in such case / the philosophours done show and determyne. Tullie says.
Plato. and Cicero in tusc. i. quest.
Fieri potest, vt oculis, et auribus apertis: nihil videamus neque audiamus. It
may come to pass (says he) yt though our eyes and ears be opyn: yet shall
we another se, nor here. Many a holy person (as saint) Katherine of Seen and
diverse other) has been so deep in contemplacion that the body (for the time)
was with out the senses, so that when they were prycked with pynnes, or nedles,
they nothing felt. So than this exercise, stands al in contemplacyon, which
thing who daily uses shall be so expert, and practysed in death / that when so
ever it shall approach and come, it shall be no new thing unto the person. For
betwyxt natural death, and this death of contemplacyon, is little difference. For
as the person that exspireth and departs this life / does leave and forsake
all this world, and all the care of kynne or friends / as father mother,
sister, and brother, neighbor / and the whole pleasure of all. So does the
person, that is deed in co^templacyon for that time / leave the body as a lump
of claye without any mind, care, or thought thereupon / or upon any other
bodily or worldly thing / wherefore wha^ death comes (as I said before) it
shall another be new, nor strange unto ye person that has been daily exercised
therein / and that had so large experyence thereof, and often practysed the same.
But as you have herd of.ii. marouwse that (for tyllynge of their land) done
labor sore all day together, and at night their labors fynished and ended /
done thankefully, and gladly each depart from other unto their own whomes,
howses, or dwelling places: so doubtless done the body and the soul, when their
labors ben accomplysshed and at an end / and the due time commen / they done
gladly and joyfully depart, each unto his propre whom / the body unto his
natural place the earth. And the soul as a prisoner newly losed and put unto
lyberte / does ren straight forth her redye race / her known course / her tried
and often trodden path, and her well used way unto her propre and natural place
/ that is heuyn. But here now you will axe of me / in what manner of
contemplacion you may best put this death in exercise / and so to have the said
experyence / and practyse of death, whereunto I answer that (although you can
teache me that lesson better than I you) I will send you unto ye little work
that I devised unto your co^munyon, or howselynge. For to write and setforth
all that here again, should be superfluous. Specially sith this work is so
little ye you may (with small cost) join or bind it with that work. And
therefore have I caused it to be prynted of ye same volume. And yet because you
shall not find the end of this little work all naked and bare / we shall make
you a breue and short remembrance of these things yt there ben said in
effect, although not after that same order. The order of this death and
co^templacion
First tha^ purposynge at that time to have the very experyence, and practyse
of death / remember depely from whe^s you came. For you were not, ne be of your
self. Than remember that when you had a being / what you were / a filthy
lump of slymy earth / and yet again, when that slymye clay was fourmed and
framed up with your soul / and you a reasonable creature / and thereunto a
creature most noble except angel / yet were you but an hethen hounde / unto
ye time you received ye grace of baptism. Than remember when, where, how, and
of whom / and by whom you had all that you now have and all that you ever
shall have that is or shall be good / and you shall find (by reason) and
perceive that you had never / ne have, or shall have any thing of your self
but evil. For when you were nothing, you had a beginning in your mothers
womb / and that by sinful generacyon with full fylthy and lothesum matter /
thus you se when, where, and how (that is) wha^ you were not, you had being:
where? in your mothers womb / how by sinful concepcyon. Of whom tha^ had
you al, of our lord god alone. And by whom, and what mean? Certainly by the
mean of our lord and savior Jesus Christ, the second person in Trinite very
essencyall god one / and the same self substance, and nature with the father,
and the holy ghost. Se well, behold, and consydre who it is that has done
for you: how excellent the person is. And than for whom he did. For you of
whom he had no need / nor you any thing had or could or might do for him / but
all he did for love, and of mere charity / and that also for his enemy / and
so being in deep prison, never to be delyuerde, but by him alone. Now
consider, and pondre well who this person is / and than look upon your self
make collacyon / and compare both together, although there may in deed, no
co^paryson be made. yet se, and behold how great and mighty a person he is /
how little, and how infyrme and feeble a person you be, how wise, and how well
learned he is / and how little learning and wisdom you have, how rich he is:
and how poor you ben / how excellent and noble he is, and how rustycall a
vyllayne you be / how goodly a person he is, and how vile and fylthy you be:
how kind and loving he is: and how churlysshe, and froward you be. And to
conclude, he most high god / and you a wretched worm of the earth he all:
and you right naught. After this collacto^ perceyuyng what manner of persons
both ben: than pondre and wey, what and how much he did for you. First he
left (in manner) all heuyn for you: and here took upon him your nature / and so
made you a great estate / cosyn and of kynne unto almighty god. And yet did he
serve here for you: not only.vii. years: as Jacob for Rachell: but for a worse
and more lothsum than Lia, all the days of his life / and here begin to
remember that life of our savior. After some such auctours as we have named
in the other works / or at the least under such a short form as we have
set forth in the book of householders. Thus his blessed incarnacyon, his joyful
birth / his paynefull circumsicyon: his honorable epiphanye / his legal
presentacyon / his sorrowful flight into Egypt / his comfortable return and
coming again in to his country / his meruaylous and learned disputyng with
the doctors at.xii. years of age, his lowly obedyence unto his parents, his
educacyon and bringing up unto ye age of nere.xxx. years his baptism his fast
in wyldernes / his temptacyon there of the wicked spirit and his victory. The
calling eletcyon and choosing of his apostles and discyples, prechynge,
techynge, labors, and miracles / and his many wrongful repreues, rebukes /
and infamyes of the jews, and their malicyous awaytes / his solempe soper /
his most meke minystrye / and service in the washing of the fete of his
apostles. The worthy consecracyon of his blessed body and blood in the which
sacrament, all his apostles were made priests / and had the same power, his
most sweet sermon and his tediouse agonye / when he swette water and blood /
his false betrayenge (by Judas) and his taking his presentacyon unto the
bysshoppes Annas and Cayphas. And the cruel dealyng of the ^ues and the
presentynge of him (by them) unto Pylate, and by him unto Herod by whom mocked
and clothed in a white fools cote / he was send again unto Pylate and by him
examyned, and without cause found: put naked and scourged and arayde with a
purpure garment and crowned with thorns with a read in his hand as a scepter
al i^ mockeage and scorn brought forth before the jews and by their cry,
and request: put again into his own clothes and condemned unto death his pain
full beryng of the heavy cross / his fatigacyon / and feyntynge under the same,
so that he fell unto the ground / his crucifixon and naylyng upon the cross
and his pytefull hangyng upon the same his death with a loud cry. The
woundynge of his heart after that death his taking down, and buryall, his
glorious resurrection and apperynges / his meruaylous ascencyon into heuyn /
where he took for you possessyon of ye plate: yt was prepared and ordained for
you, before ye co^stitucyon and ordinance of ye world. Here you may remember
ye co^modytes of ye place: which in hit self is most hyghly beauteous,
fair, goodly, and pleasant above that can be thought upon earth and of all
things that been in this world, is there plentye and abundance without any
need or want possessyon is there of the land that never shall decay / and
riches that never shall be minisshed or made less. And as unto ye co^modites
of the body and goods of nature there is youth, ever florysshyng fresshe
without age or any miseryes thereof. Beauty and fayrenes, without any deformyte
/ or fading. Might and strength* without debilyte or feebleness health without
syckenes, or disease / all pleasure and never pain. Ever mirth without any
morning, ever gladness: and never sadness. Ever joy, and never sorrow of all
things co^tentacion without any murmr or grudge. Ever love, and never hate.
Ever charity, and never envy, mercy, pitye, and compassyon / without any
crueltye, or unkindness. Ever unity and peace and never varyaunce: ne debate.
Ever troth and fidelite: without any falshed or deceyte. Ever justice equite:
and right / and never oppression / ne wrong. Ever due honor / and reverence
and never dysdayne ne dyspyte. And to conclude there is all that is good / and
never evil. And of all these things: constant durans, 1. Cor. ii.
without any mynysshynge, mutabilyte or chaung. And yet ben there mo co^modytes
tha^ ear may here, eye may se, tongue may tell, or any heart may think. which
almighty god has ordained for them that love him. And yet there is unto all
these co^modytes, life immortal, and everlasting. And yet forthermore, you may
co^sydre in what company / and with whom you shall use, and inioye the said
co^modytes. There shall you find your holy patrones / such saints, as you
daily have served / the pure company of virgynes / the co^fessours, and martyrs
/ the innocents, the apostles / ye patryarches and prophets. And ye goodly
bright company of angels / al ready to present you unto our lady the blessed
glorious virgyne Marye / and by her with them to be recommended and committed
unto her dear sone our lord / and most sweet savior Jesus, which will not
disdain to receive you most beningly and gently and so to represe^t and offer
you unto ye presence of his most worthy father which (by him) is also your
father. Se now (good devout soul) behold, and look well and inwardly, perceive
where you now ben / and with whom. With your lord and ma^^ter / your very
father and brother your governor and gyder / your help and comfort your only
refuge, and succor your inward love: your whole heart and desire, redemer and
savior, your creature and maker, your god and all your good: with all ye holy
saints and angels of heuyn in ye presence / and before ye throne of ye
glorious trinite, ye father ye sone and the holy ghost.iii. distinct persons,
and one nature one substance one essencyall god. Se now (I say) and take heed
where and with whom you be. And here knelynge or rather lyenge down prostrate
upon your face: remain, bide and dwell here still / here expyre and dye stark
deed / and utterly that no soul ne spirit be left or bide in your body /
but all for the time so far departed / not only from all things of the
world, but also from the self body yt there lyenge as a lu^pe of cley be left
without any senses or wits of heryng, seeing, smelling, tastyng, or
touchynges. So done we read (as I said before) of saint Ambrose, Aug. li.
confess.
saint Kathe^yne of Shene with diverse other. This is now the most high
point of this exercise and practyse of death after the very definicyon of
death. Which (as I sade) is called a departing of the soul from the body.
For in this death (for that time) your soul is departed from your body, so
that you be not than your self: but deed and clean from your self. For as ye
yren lyenge in the fire / is by similytude al fire, so ben you al one with god.
Qui adheret deo / vnus spiritus est. i. Cor. vi.d.
Who so ever (says saint Paul) does cleue, and stycke fast unto our lord:
is with him one spirit. So ben you than that same thing that you shall be /
with our lord hereafter, that is al one with him / dwelling and abiding in
him, and he in you so al divine and godly. Say now (good devout soul) if you
can think or suppose in con^^^^ce, that any faithful christy(...)sing this
exercise: and so ha(...)ge so large experyence and pract^se of death / may have,
feel, or perc^yue, any notable pain in death / syt^ now in this death, so
oftymes exercysed the body prycked with pynnes or nedyles: feleth no pain at
all. Or how may any horror dread, or fear, troble or move that person / that
is in such place, with such company and in such case as before we have
showed. yet (say you) sir the devil will be present at my death / what than?
say I so peradventure / he will be at this daily exercise. For so done we read
in the lives: and collacyons of the holy fathers / but that has always ben,
and ever shall be unto his co^fusyon / rebuke, and hurt / and unto your
triumph, glory, and praise. But yet you say, that the sight of that greslye
ghost, can not be without great fear: whereunto I say again that although the
sight of him be (of it self) horrible, ugly, and fearful / yet ben there
diverse co^fortes ready at hand to help. One is that may be sure, he can not
hurt you. An other is, (...)diue Brigit. li. vi. ca. lxxxxiii.
the presence of the holy saints, your said fryndes ye will restrain his
power and malicyous will. For they ben much more valiant and mighty than he
is. And doubt you not they will al be priest, and ready there at ye time about
you / not feyned, but as faithful friends, with whom well acquoynted and
fully known / you ben now and of long time have been very familyer and
whomely. Trust you surely in them, for they will not deceive you. For if they
did, they were not faithful / but rather feyned friends. For a very friend
(says the wyseman) loves at all times and ever is proved in necessyte or
need: and at death is most need. For although good love and faithful
fre^dshyppe / be well proved in all the life time: yet is it better proved at
the time of death / and best of all after death. For than co^munely feyned
fre^des done sone forget. But these friends will never forget you. For as they
now (in your health) done daily conforte and defend you in all temtacyo^s: so
will they at your death deliver you out of all dangers / and afterward will they
deduce, led, co^uey, and carry or bear you up unto the place and company before
rehearsed. And yet have you no marvel though (in ye mean time) they suffer
you to be troubled and grudged with the opinyon of death and with the dread of
yt ugly sight. For they done so suffer for your wealth and merit that you
thereby may be exercised with death: and so to be ever ready for it. For death
only seems evil and only is feared by opinyon and not of any other right
cause. For death of it self is very good and to be looked and waited for, and
received of all persons, specially thus exercysed / not only without fear or
dread of pain / but also, as we said before, with fervent desire great joy and
gladness as the fynall conclusyon and last end of all miseryes, sorrows, and
all euyls, and as the beginning of all welthe and goodness (that is to say) of
everlasting health and salvation in the bliss of heuyn. Whyther he bring us
ye bought us, our lord and most sweet savior Jesus Christ, that lives and
reigns with god the father / and with god the holy ghost world without end.
Amen.

Thus (after our poor abilyte) have made an end of this poor labor of the
daily exercise, experyence and practyse of death. *
When I had written up this little work redye to the pryntyng / it pleased a
wise and well learned man, to take the labor to read it over, and to show his
judgment and mind in diverse things and places. And among other, because I
had made mencyon in it / of rap^es or transes (unto the which in deed) very
few persons done duly attain or clymbe, and come so hye / he aduysed me to
warn ye devout reders thereof / that they give not to light credence to all
such persons. For many of them have disceyued many men, that were full holy
and devout. For those may sonest be deceived in such persons, because they
ever suppose the best in every person, without suspicyon of evil in any
person. And they ben most glad to here yt our lord should so visyte and
comfort his people. But yet such persons may also in them self be disceyued
dyuersly. For some such persons that were simple and very devout, have been
disceyued by a wicked spirit / that (to illude and mock them / has
tra^sfygured and showed him self as an angel of light / and has showed unto
the persons many things full good and godly / and some things to come after
ye form of prophecy, yt have truly common to pass in effect: and all to
cause them to give faith and credence unto other things unlawful and false.
But to write here, how such a spirit should be known from an angel or a good
spirit: it should be a long work, and also superfluus, sith, who so ever have
mind to se that matter / may have it well and plainly setforth and declared in
english, by a learned man a bacheler of diuinyte / one of our devout
brethren, lately departed: whom Jesus perdon, master Wyllyam Bond / in his
book called the Pylgremage of perfeccyon in the.vii. chapyter of the second
book and in the third and.iiii. chapyters of the third book, in the.iii.
days journey. Some other persons ben deceived only by the corrupcyon of
fantasye, which causes them to think and believe verily, yt such things as
(by only ymagynacyon) come unto their minds, ben verily spoken unto them / as
some done think that ye crow or other bird, does say or sing certain
words, or that the bell or bellys done ring and say after their ymagynacyon.
And of this sort ben many persons, and much different, according to the
disease of the head / as the fantasye is more or less corrupted. And yet some
of the^ will show many meruaylous things, that they believe verily for true,
which in deed were never true. But these persons done co^munelye show
nothing that is greatly evil: nor yet any great good / but that men may fone
discern and perceive for fantasyes and ymagynacyon / except the persons were
some preuey sinners. And than will the wicked speryte be redye to put him self
in prease / and with that corrupcyo^ to help forth unto illusyon. But yet ben
other deceyuers, though none of this sort / but of a more deuelisshe sort
very ypocrytes, that feyne them self to have reuelacyons, and know well they
have none such, but that (to deceive the people) seem in a transe or rapt /
when they will, as we read of David, that feyned him self mad, i. ^eg. xxi.d.
and in a rage upon a certain time: For a good purpose to save his self. And
so playde his pagyant, that he frothed or fomed at the mouth / and raged as
though^ he had been furyous and mad in deed. And so done these wretches the
disceyuynge of many persons wilfully and of purpose. But how to be ware of
such wretches and ypocrytes: surely it is very hard. For as to give ouerlyght
credence to such persons, is against wisdom: so utterly to co^dempne the^,
or to dispyse them / is peryllous and against virtue. Wisdom is therefore, to
prove well the spirit before. yet do I now ymagyn what many persons will say
hereunto, that is, that this exercise is a matter over high / and exceeding the
wits and understanding of simple unlearned people. And so is the the other work
also / whereunto I do send them in this work, that is to say / the disposicyon
and ordinance unto co^minyon or houselynge. Whereunto I say again, that both
the works ben so divided into such parts: that every person may take what he
will, according to his state and condicyon. Read the work ones over, and than
chose / for I think there ben but few persons: but y^ they may lightly
understand and use one of those exercyses. And (as a great learned man said of
a work that he had send forth) although this work were so devised: Cicero
de orato profecto.
that few persons might attain to the full heyght and clear understanding
thereof: yet should no person despair, ne be discouraged thereby. For as a
prycke or mark is set in a butte for all men to shute at: although none hytte
the prycke. Those that done shute nere ben not without praise. i. Cor. ix. d.
And saint Paul says, when there is a glayue set up for renners: all or many
done run / but one catches the glayue alone / and yet is it another shame ne
rebuke, to win the second or the third game. But here in our ca^pe, none
that does assaye to run / shall be without a synglar reward. 1. Cor. iii.c.
For (as the same apostle says) every person shall receive his propre wages
or reward: acccordyng to his labor and deseruynge. And many times it may here
fortune, and come to pass / that those that come last: shall be first and best
rewarded. Math. xx. b.
So says our savior in the gospel. Erunt primi nouissimi, et nouissimi
primi. In this camp / the first shall be last, and the last shall (in reward)
be first. The respect and weight of this labor: stands not in the bodily
exercise of the outward work / but in the infors and dilygence of the will /
put thereunto your good will and dilygence to do what you can: And though it be
but very very little that you speed or do in this exercise: that little little,
though it be never so little: yet shall it be greatly rewarded. And
peradventure, much more merit and reward shall the dull person have by that
infors, dilyge^ce and good will: than shall the learned and quycke wytted
persons: that more lightly and with less labor done speed in this matter. Let
no person therefore despair ne take discomforte with any dullness. For the
poet says. Labor improbus omnia vincit. Importune labor does ouerco^e all
things. And yet though some persons can (by no means, fall unto the highest
exercise of this lesson: let the^ fall unto prayer / and be sorry that they can
not fly so high, making protestacyon / and call our lord to witness / that
feign and gladly they would do what best might please his goodness / And let
them there committee, recommende, betake, and bequeth them self body and soul
unto his hands at that time: as they intend to do, at the hour of death. And
beseech his grace / that this recommendacyon and bequeste, may stand / and of
him be received for that time / and therewith let them say. In manns tuas. etc.
as is beforesayd. Some persons every year ones at ye least, and some.iiii.
times, that every quarter ones / done make their funeralles / that is / all the
solempnyte of their buryalles, with Dirige and mass / and offer their mass
penny them self. And after that / make a feast and dele alms: as though they
were than deed in deed and buried / also which custom I praise very much. And
if yt were done every month ones or every weke / or yet every day, of them
that have abilyte and time thereunto. I would think and judge it a devout and
meritoryous obseruaunce. For those persons, that by any of these / or like
means, done so prepare and make them self ready to death: may be sure never to
dye suddenly. For many persons ben sore affrayde of soden death / and done full
heartily make prayer, that they never dye suddenly. Let them use this manner / or
some one of these forms and manner of exercyses / and they may be sure of their
prayer / that is, never to dye suddenly. Study therefore good devout souls, to
be ready at every hour / and pray unto our lord, that you may have the will
that saint Paul had, Phi. i.c
wha^ he said. I covet and desire / to be dyssolued, and to depart this life
/ and to be with Christ. Whether he bring us all that made us. Amen.

Certain small works of a brothers of Syon Richard Whytforde. The contents
of this book.
FIrst a dyaloge and co^municacyon, between ye householder and his household. An
other dyaloge between the curate and his ghostly child. Two manners of
alphabetes / crosroes / called. A.b.c. A daily exercise, and experye^ce of death
/ all duly corrected by the self auctour, and now prynted trewely.
The said auctour required me instantly that I should not prynte nor join any
other works unto his. Specially of uncertain auctours. For (of late) he
found a work joined in the same volume with his works / and bought and taken
for his work / and was not his. But was put there instead of a work of his.
That before was named among the contents of his book. And yet his work left
out / as is contained in this preface here unto the reders.

Unto the devout reders, Richard Whytforde a professed brother of Syon /
gretyng in our savior Jesus everlasting.
I Suppose and think verily good devout reders / that when you read these pore
simple works: some of you yt have had mind to read them / will now marvel
to se and perceive that these ben the same works that went forth before, and
nothing changed in substance / but only the title, and some few things
added. Some other will paraduenture judge or fear in me ambicyon that I would
seem to make many works / and yet did send forth but the same, newely
changed or disguysed. To satisfye therefore your devout minds with the trothe
in true conscience / there is none such cause. But yet causes there ben diverse
appartaynynge both unto you and me. One cause is that I trust verily you have
them here in a more perfect lettre than you had before. And also more truly
prynted. For (of a suretye) the the other letter was much vicyous and faultye /
and that in some places, that might seem unto my neglygencye. And also in the
same volume or book / is one of my works left out / which work is nombred
among the contents of the same volume and book. And instead of my work, is
an other heretyke or heretycall work set in place / and the whole book sold
for my work / which thing is the most chief cause of the said mutacyon or
change. For that thing does not only put me unto infamye and sclaunder: but
also does put all the reders in ieopardye of conscience to be infecte and also
in the danger of the kings laws, for the manyfolde erronyous opynyons that been contained in the same book. Now judge you (devout reders) whether these
causes ben not reasonable for the said mutacyon and change. I pray you
therefore of your charity take all unto the best. And by my poor advise / read
not those books that go forth without named auctours. For (doubtless) many of
them that seem very devout and good works: ben full of heresies. And your old
english poet says. There is no poison so peryllous of sharpnes, as that
is: that has of sugre a swetnes. I would gladly ye wealth and not ye ieopardye
of your souls our lord god, and most sweet savior Jesus my judge / who keep
you, and send you ye increase of grace. Ame^.

Christ with the 12 apostles

A Dialoge or co^munycacion between the householder and his household.
The spekers.

First speaks the householder and than speaks one of the household for all the
residue.

The householder. GOod chylderne and friends: I had (of late) counsel to call
you all to gether. And (for the discharge of my conscience) to show unto you a
form of living: first therefore let us co^sydre that all we been mortal, as
well the rich as ye poor, the young as the old, there is no difference, none
except, all must needs dye. And though we live very long, yet shall we dye
shortly: for ye lengest life of this world, is very short. And yet have we no
certain, ne yet conjecture of knowledge, wha^ / where / how, or in what state
we shall depart this life. And sure we been, tha^ as we been found at that
time, so shall we be taken, and without respite or delay, forthwith shall we be
presented and brought before ye high judge, that can not be deceived, to make
a count of all our life past, where no man of law may speak for us, ne any
excuse may serve us. Our own conscience shall there speak and tell plain
truth, without craft or dissymulacion, and (in a momente, a twynclynge of an
eye) shall clerly confess all our hole life, and every wryncle and part
thereof: which confession, if our life were good, shall be unto our great honor,
comfort, reioysynge, and joy everlasting. And contrary, if it were evil, it
shall be unto our great shame and rebuke, unto our endless sorrow and pain and woe
everlasting. We have need therefore to be well ware, how we spend our time,
how we pass this life, or rather how this life passes us. And much shall
it auayl and profit unto the health of our souls: often times for to remember
our last end. The wise man says. Ecclesi. vii.
In omnibus operibus tuis, memorare nouissima tua, etc. In all thy works
(says he) remember thine ending day and what things shall come unto the at
thy last end, and thou shalt never do sin, ne co^tynue euerlastyngly
therein.


One of the household. Sir we all byseche you, than, yt you will show and teache
us yt form, and mean our way that you speak of.


The household. The first point therefore of a good Christian, is to entende
and purpose with good heart and constaunte mind, to avoid sin, and dyligently
to study how to fle and beware of the occasyons thereof. And than to appoynte
him self unto some custumable course of good and profitable exercise. Psalmo.
xxxiii.
Diuerte a malo, and fac bonu^. (says the prophet) Turn away thy face,
thy heart, will, and mind, from all evil, and appoynte thy self to work
good works.


The person of ye household. Sir, hit is sone said, Fle evil and do good. But
I pray you show us forther how to do so.


The household. For a form therefore how to follow ye same by co^tinuaunce I
shall show you my poor advise. I speak unto you good simple and devout
souls, yt would feign live well your self, and also comfort all other unto
ye same. First than eueryche begin with your self. And as soon as you do awake
in the morning, to arise for all day. First suddenly turn your mind and
remembrance unto almighty god, and than use (by co^tynuall custom) to make a
cross with your tho^be upon your foreheed or front, in sayng of these words.
In nomine patris: and than an other cross upon your mouth, with these words,
Et filii. And the third cross upon your breast / saying, Et spu^s sancti.
Amen. And if your devotion be thereto, ye may again make one hole cross, from
your heed unto your fete, and from the left shulder to ye right sayng all
together. In no mine patris and filii et spu^s sancti. Amen. That is to mean,
I do bless and mark my self with the cognisaunce and badge of Christ, in the
name of the father, and in the name of the sone, and in ye name of the holy
ghost, yt is to say, the holy Trinite.iii. persons and one God. Than say or
think after this form. Good lord god my maker and redemer, here now in thy
presence, I do (for this time and for all the time of my hole life) by queth
and betake, or rather do freely give my self, soul and body, with all my heart
and mind unto the, good lord, and unto thy hands to be thy bond servant
for ever, according unto ye promise made in my baptysme at the font stone. And
here now I do ratyfye and newly confyrme the same and do fully consent in
heart and mind thereto, never here after, by the help of thy grace, to
contrary the same, but to co^tynue in thy laws, good lord, unto the end of
my life. But where thou know, good lord ye I am a frail person, infyrme,
feeble and weyke, and of my self prone and ready, i^ thought, Genesis* viii.
word and deed unto evil, from the beginning of my life hitherto: I beseech
the good lord god and father of all puysaunce and power, of all might and
stre^ght, that thou will defend me from all mine enemies, and give me
spiritual strenght and power, yt I may / in the / vaynquysshe and overcome,
fle and avoid all such fraylte, light manners or disposicions, as should be
contrary to thy will and pleasure, and that according unto this will of the
spirit, which thy goodness has now freely given unto me, I may destroy the
will of the flesh and so continue unto the end of my life. And yet good
lord, where thou know also that I am but rude and unlearned, without wit
wisdom and due knowledge of the and thy laws, all ignorant and as an ydiote
or fool in all good and spiritual understanding, I byseche the good lord god
that art the essential sone of god the father, and unto whom is appropriate
all wit and wisdom, all science / conning and knowledge, and all right
perceiving and understanding / that thou will grant me the due knowledge of
thy self by right and true faith, and the knowledge of all thy benefytes and
gifts done to me and all mankind / and grace dewly to thank the for them.
And also due knowledge of mine own self, of the state and condition of my life
and co^uersacio^, and specially of my wretchedness with due contricion for all my
sins. And knowledge also of thy laws, will and pleasure / so that by no manner
of ygnoraunce or mysvnderstandyng, I do (at any time) in work or deed / or in
word or thought: any thing contrary unto the same. And thyrdly (good lord)
where you knoweste also that I am often times obstinate of mind, froward and
evil wylled / stubburne of stomach and unkind of heart / dull / neglygent,
and slothful in all manner of goodness, I beseech the good lord god holy ghost
/ that art ye spirit and will of the father / and of the sone, and with the^
ye same self essenciall god, unto whom is appropriate and specially appointed
/ all bou^te / all goodness / all grace and good will, that you would voyche
saffe to give me the grace of good will, so that I never do / say / ne think
that should be contrary to thy will. And having unto the ever a reuere^de
dread, I may love the for thy self, and all other in the (lord) and for the /
so that according unto the spiritual strength and knowledge that thou have
given me, I may apply my will holy unto thy will / so that I have no will
propre unto my self, but yt my will be all thy will, and both (as much as
may be possible) one will. And so I may here in this life order my love, and
come unto such perfection of fervent charity yt (by ye grace) I may attain
unto ye fruicio^ of everlasting charity in thy joyful presence. Ame^. And
good lord god father of heaven, I beseech the take and receive me thus unto thy
grace. and have mercy and pity upon me and all thy people. And thou lord God
blyssed sone of god the father, and savior and redemer of the world / have
pytie and mercy upon me and upon all Christen people. And loving lord god holy
ghost and blessed spirit of god / have mercy and pity upon me and all the
world. Holy and blessed Trinite, one self and same essenciall god / have pity
and mercy upon me and all mine / and upon all thy creatures. Amen. And than
ones again bless the with, In nomine patris: as before, and tha^ go forth
unto your busynes where ye will. Let this be for your morning exercise. And
though you that have great things to do, would think this prayer and
morning exercise over long, because of your busynes I acerteyne you, if it
ones were by use gotten ready and incorporate and prynted in the heart and mind,
it would sone be said or thought / and the person should (I believe) have grace
to speed ye better in other things, and nothing forthynke of the spe^dynge of
the time, but rather accounte it for great gaynes, in so much that we purpose
to set forth in the end a longer exercise, for them that have longer time to
spe^de, but now we shall go forth herin. After ye said morrow exercise I
trust you will be well occupied upon your appointed course of occupacion. For
that was our counseyle in ye beginning, that ye should appoynte your self, by
a co^tynuall course, unto some certain occupacion that may be profitable, and
ever to avoid ydlenes the mother and nourse of all sin and evil. And ever
beware of such occupacions as ben called communly pastymes, that is to say,
all manner of unlawful games / and such disportes as done draw people rather
to vice tha^ to virtue, which more properly may be called lose times than
pastymes. For sith / Math. xii.c
by the affyrmacio^ of our fauyoure, we shall make accoumpte of every idle
word / it must needs follow that we shall make a more strayte reckoning of
every idle or evil work. Let therefore your said appointed occupacion be
always good: virtuous and profitable. Sith tha^ ye must needs make a reckoning
of every work: word and thought (for none of these ca^ be hyd or kept preuy
from your audytour) me thinks it should be a great suretye for you: to make
every day ones your said accou^te by your self. The common proverb is, that
often reckoning holds long fellawshype. I would advise you therefore to spe^de
some time there upon at night after all your occupacio^s, before your bed, there
knele down and there begin to remember wheder ye went and what ye did
i^mediatly after your morrow exercise, and in what company ye were, and what
was there your behavior and demanour, i^ work, word, or thought, and so go
forth unto every place / time and company as brekefaste / dinner / soupper / or
drinking / and where you find or perceive any thing that was good / virtuous
/ and profitable / ascribe and apply that unto our lord god, and give unto him
all ye glory, laud and praise thereof / for he alone is ye gyuer of all goodness
/ and so over pass that thing lightly. And where ye remember of any special
thing done / said / or thought amysse / flycke and bide thervpo^ / and bulte
it (as they say) and turn it up so down / and try the weight and danger
thereof, with all the manner and circumstaunce of the same. So may ye know the
qua^tytie thereof, that is to say, how great a sin or how little it is /
how be it, none offense cane be little that does offe^de god, and surely
every sin. is offense done unto god, although it seem to be done unto man.
For as ye love of god does begyn^e at ye love of ye neighbor (For he yt loves
not his neighbor) who^ he may se with his bodyly eye or sight (says saint
John^) how may he love god (whom he ca^ not so se) so in like manner the
offense of the neighbor is forth with ye offense of god. i. Ioh. ii.
Consider therefore unto whom the trespass is done, and so that consyderacion
with the other qualyties and quantyties of the sin, shall bring you unto a
bassheme^t thereof, and to be sorry therefore, or (at ye leest) to will or wysshe
that ye had not so done. Tha^ mekely cry god mercy / and ask him forgyuenes
thereof with very purpose and mind to be confessyd thereof at due time, and to
take and do penance therefore. And I dare assure you that this manner of
accoumpte and reckoning (though your sin were never so great) shall save you
from the ieopardy of da^nacio^ / which is no little grace and goodness of God.
Thank him than lowly therefore, and so bless your self, as you did in the
morning / and your bed also / and go thereunto, and so committee your self
all hole body and soul unto the protection / custody and keeping of our lord,
who give you good night and good rest. Amen. It shall be right well also that
ye call upon such holy saints as you have special devotion unto, under this
form or some other like. Blessed lady Mary mother of god always vgin, I
beseech ye pray for me, and for all Christians. Holy angel of god, what so
ever thou be that art deputed and appointed unto my custody, I (submyttynge me
with most lowly obedience) beseech the to pray for me and for all the world.
Saint Michaell, saint Gabriell, saint Raphaell, with all holy angels and
archa^gels, I beseech you pray for me and for all people. Saint John^ baptyste
and all holy patriarchs and prophets: I beseech you pray for me and for all
christendom. Saint Peter, saint Paul, saint John^ the euangeliste, and all
holy apostles and eua^gelistes, I beseech you pray for me and for all the
world, and you also all disciples of our lord, and holy Innocents. Saint
Stephan, and all holy martyrs. Saint Augustine / and all holy confessors /
all religious persons and heremites. Saint Katheryne / saint Margarete, saint
Barbara, and all holy virgins: I beseech you pray for me / and for all
persons. And finally all you holy saints of heaven, of every degree and state
where you be, I beseech you all in general / and eueryche in special / pray
for me and all mankind. Here may you bring in ye patrones of your churches or
dioces, and such as you have (as I said) synguler devotion unto. And here an
end as unto your self.


The person for the household. Sir / this work is good for religious persons
/ and for such persons as been solytary: and done lie alone by the^ self /
but we done lie.ii. or.iii. sometime together / and yet in one chamber diverse
beds and so many in company / if we should use these things in presence of
our fellows, some would laugh us to scorn and moke us.


The householder. O bone Jesus. O good lord Jesus, what here I now? I dar well
say, there been but few persons in England but they would bide some danger
or rebuke for pleasure of their king or prince, and many for their master or
maistres, or their soueraynes and some for their friends and fellows, and
specially where great gaynes should grow thereby unto the^ self. And for the
pleasure of God our father, and of our sweet sauyoure Jesus our brother, should
we be abashed to take danger and bear a poor mock or scorn, that never
shall wound our flesh, ne yet tere our skyn^e for ye pleasure of our pereles
prince king of kings / and lord of all lords? Fie for shame that any
christian should be so cowardous. Ventre upon it, go forth withal. In.ix.
days (as they say) the danger shall be past / fere nothing. Every beginning
is hard and of great diffyculte. Omne principium difficile. Labor i^probus
oi^a vincit.
But i^portune labor does vaynquysshe and overcome all things. I tell you,
this daily exercise by custom and use, shall seem very short and sweet,
profitable and pleasant. Read it or here it over ones or twyse at the leest
before you cast it away. How be it we think it not sufficient nor enough for
us to live well our self, but yt all other christians also live the better for
us and by our example, and specially those yt we have i^ charge and
governance, that is to say: our chylder and servants. And me seems it
should also be a good pastyme and much meritorious: for you that cane read, to
gather your fellows about you on the holy day, specially the young sort and
read to them this pore lesson. For therein be such things as both you and
they been bound to know, or can say: yt is the Pater noster: the Aue maria:
and the Creed / with such other things as done follow. I would therefore you
should begin with them by time in youth as soon as they ca^ speak. For it is
an old saying. The pot or vessel shall ever savor or smell of yt thing
wherewt it is first seasoned. Quod noua resta capit: in ueterata sapit.
And your english proverb says / that ye young cock croweth as he does
here and learn of the old. you may in youth teache the^ what ye will / and
that shall they lengest keep and remember. We should therefore above all things,
take heed and care in what company our chylderen been nourysshed and brought
up. For educacion and doctrine, yt is to say, bringing up and learning, done
make the manners, with good and virtuous persons (says the prophet) you shall be
good and virtuous. Psalmo. xvii.
And with the evil persons, you shall be also evil. Let our chylder therefore
use and keep good company. The pie, the iay, and other birds, done speak what
they most here by ear. The plouer by sight will follow the gesture and
behauyour of the fowler. And the ape by exercise will work and do as she is
taught / and so will the dog (by violence) contrary to natural disposicion:
learn to dance. The chylder therefore that by reason don far excede other
creatures will bear away what they here spoken, they should therefore be used
unto such company where they should here none evil / but where they may here
godly and Christian words. They will also have in their gestures and
behauyoure such manners as they se and behold in other persons. And as they
been taught / so will they do / and in many things they may be compelled unto
a contynuall custom / which does alter and change natural disposicion.
Unto some crafts or occupacions a certain age is required in chylder / but
virtue and vice may be learned in every age. We must se therefore that in any
wise you use no company but good and virtuous. And as soon as they can speak:
we must also teache our chylder to serve god and say the Pater noster. Aue. and
Creed. as I said before. And not only our chylder, but also se and prove that
all our servants, what age so ever they be of: ca^ say the same. And therefore
don we use daily yt in every mele / dinner or soupper / one person should with
loud voice say thus.


The first peticion.
PAter noster qui es in celis: sanctificet nomen tuum. Good lord god, our holy
father ye art in heaven let thy name he sanctified: that is to mean / I
beseech the grant us grace to bless, to honor, to laud and praise thy
holy name.

The second.
Adueniat regnum tuum. Good lord god our father that art in heaven / let thy
kingdom come: that is, I beseech the lord, that all the people of the world
may come unto the grace of baptism, and so be the faithful subjects of thy
realm and kingdom of Christianite.

Fiat voluntas tua: The third.
sicut in celo et in terra. Good lord god our father that art in heaven, let
thy will be wrought in earth as it is wrought in heaven: yt is to mean I beseech
the lord, that all thy christian people here in earth may perform thy will,
and keep thy commandments after their estate and condition, as thy holy
angels and saints done in heaven after their state and degree.

Panem nostrum cotidianu^ da nobis hodie. The fourth.
Good lord god our holy father yt art in heaven, give and grant unto us this
day our daily bread: that is to mean, I beseech the good lord grant unto us
contynually the spiritual fode grace and effect of thy holy sacraments. Or
thus. Grant unto us the contynuall grace and effect of thy holy sacraments
/ which is the daily fode of our souls, and spiritual suerty of our
salvation.

The fyfthe.
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra: sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.
Good lord god our holy father that art in heaven, forgive us our dettes, as we
done forgive our detters, that is to mean, I beseech the good lord, forgive
and pardon me and all Christians all manner of offenses and trespaces done
against the and thy laws / likewise as we done forgive all manner of persons
all manner of greues and trespaces done against us.

The.vi.
Et ne nos inducas in te^tationem. Good lord god our holy father that art in
heaven / led us not in to temptacion / that is to mean, I beseech the good
lord, suffer me not, ne any Christian, to be led or brought by any temptation
/ unto the full consent of any sin.

Sed libera nos a malo. The.vii.
But good lord god our holy father that art in heaven, deliver me and all
christians from evil: yt is to mean, I beseech the good lord / that not
only thou keep me and all thy people from all sin and offense of thy goodness
/ but also that thou will deliver and make us quyte of all sins paste / and
conserve and keep us continually in the state of grace. Ame^. So be it: that is
to mean / good lord we beseech the that all these things may come to pass
in full effect / according to our peticion and desire.

This prayer of ye Pater noster / is ye most excellent prayer, because yt our
savior made it him self / and taught it to his disciples.

The Aue Maria, is ye most plesaunte prayer, and of most honor unto our
blessed lady, because one part thereof is the salutacion of ye angel Gabriell,
whereby immediately after her consent, she conceived the sone of god in her
womb. And the other part, was spoken unto her by saint Elizabeth, inspired
and moved thereunto by the spirit of god the holy ghost. And therefore dowe set
forth the Aue maria, after such manner as we did the Pater noster.

AVe Maria gratia plena dominus tecum: benedicta tu in mulieribus et benedictus
fructus ventris tui Jesus. Ame^. Hayle Mari full of grace, god is with the.
Blessed be thou among women, and blessed be the fruit of thy womb Jesus
Christ, god and man. Amen. So mote it be.

That first word Aue, which I do English after the commune manner, hayle is a
word of salutacion, as we say in commune co^gresses or metynges together. God
speed you, god save you, god bless you. Good morrow / good eue^, god speed,
god be at your game, god be at your work, god send you, with such other,
after the manner of the country where it is spoken. And the last word Amen, it
is a word of consent or desire, that the matter spoken before should
understand what every word means.

Now does follow the Creed.
The first article. CRedo in deu^ patrem omnipotentem: Saint Peter.
creatorem celi et terre. I believe upon god the father almighty, maker of heaven
and of earth. This term: In deum / is diversely Englysshed, some done say / in
to god, some: inwardly in god / some: perfytly in god. But the most commune
use of the country of the unlearned people / is to say. I believe upon god and
upon his faith / but all does mean in effect / that the person has perfyte
faith and believe in god / and unto god. The second article. Saint Andrew.
Et in Iesum Christum filiu^ eius vnicum dominum nostrum. And I also believe
perfytely upon our lord Jesus Christ his only begote^ sone: yt is to say, ye
only begoten sone of the said father. The third article. Saint Johan.
Qui co^ceptus est de spu^ scto^: natus ex maria virgin. And also I believe
perfytly ye our said lord Jesus was conceived of the holy ghost, borne of our
lady saint Mary: she remaynyng and abydyng ever ever a virgin. The fourth
article. Passus sub pontio Pilato / crucifixus mortuus et sepultus. Saint
James: the more
And also I perfytly believe yt our said lord Jesus did suffer his passion, and
was crucified, deed, and buried, under the power and judgment of a man called
by propre name Poncius / and by his second or surename Pylate. The fyfth
article. Descendit ad inferna: Saint thomas of Jude.
tertia die resurrexit a mortuis. And I believe perfytely also / that our said
lord Jesus: after his said passion and death / descended and went down unto
ye low places of hell / and brought forth from thense our first father Adam:
and all that were there with him / and that upon the third day after his death:
he did arise from death / and all the bonds thereof unto life everlasting. The
syxth article. Saint James / the less.
Ascendit ad celos: sedet ad dexteram dei patris oi^potentis. And also I believe
perfytly: yt our said lord Jesus did ascend and stye up unto the highest
heuens, and there does sit upon the right hand of god the father oi^potent and
almighty. The seventh article. Saint Philipe.
Jude ve^turus est iudicare viuos et mortuos. And I also perfytely believe, that
he will come these again in to this world, to judge all persons quycke and
deed. The.viii. article. Saint Bartelmewe.
Credo in spiritum sanctum. I believe perfytly also upon the holy ghost, the
spirit of ye father and of the sone, and with them both the same self god.
The.ix. article. Saint Mathewe.
Sanctam ecclesiam catholica^. I also believe that the church of Christ is and
was / and evermore shall be holy and faithful / therefore I do give faith and
crede^ce unto the same, and unto the determinacions thereof. The.x. article.
Sanctorum communionem: Saint Simon.
remissione^ peccatorum. I believe also ye communion of saints: yt is to say /
I believe that all the works and good deeds of all good and holy persons / ben
and shall be common: so that every faithful Christian has and shall have part
with other. And also I believe the remisson of sins: that is to say / that all
manner of sins may and shall be forgyuen / if forgyuenes be duly desired and
axed. The.xi. article. Carnis resurrectionem. Saint Jude: called also saint
Tadeus.
I also believe the resurrection of our flesh / that is to say / I believe yt
all manner of persons shall arise at the day of dome in soul and body with
the same flesh, blood and bones that they were borne with and dyed with.
The.xii. article. Saint Mathie.
Et vitam eternam. Amen. And I also believe everlasting life: that is to say,
that (after ye general resurrection (all manner et persons / as well good as
evil: dampened or saved / shall co^tynue in life everlasting, either in joy
or pain, and never depart therfro^. This word Amen, is declared before in
the end of the Pater noster.
This manner of ye Pater noster, Aue, and Creed, I would have used and read upon
the book at every mele / or at the leeste ones a day with a loud voice (as I
said) that all ye persons present may here it. And yet forther I would
advise and counseyle all other householders to se (as I do) know / and prove /
that every person in their house / and all that been under their governance
and charge (can say the same) and therefore they must take ye labor to here
them them self, and where need is: to teache them. For many yt ben aged and can
not say will be abashed to learn it openly, and yet if they here it daily
read after the manner showed before: they shall by use and custom learn it
very well. And some other persons there been: that can say right well / both
upon the book and without, but yet among them some been dulla^des and
slothful and some negligente and careless / and so done they not say it: but
in time forgete it / as in manner they hade never learned it. I pray you therefore
(good devout householders do as I do) take the pain to here them your self:
at the leest^ ones a weke and let none escape you / old nor young. It shall
(believe me) be unto you a great discharge of conscience, and not without merit
and great reward. And charge them straytly under pain of punysshement / that
they say it every day three times at the leest / that is to say / in the
morning / at none or myddaye / and at night. Than must you teache them to know
by order ye precepts or commandments of god, ye names of ye.vii. pri^cipall
sins, and of their.v. wits, as thus. The commandments of god ben.x. in
no^bre. may do no bodily or worldly labors for lucre therein. i. Ioh. iii.
is an homicide and ma^sleer. or books. Exodus xx.
The first apperteyneth and belongs unto almighty god, him self. And in
that part be^ contained the three first commandments, and all those three
commandments ben contained in this one commandment of the gospel. Love
god above all things. And in the second part or second table, been the
other seven contained, which done apperteyne and belong unto the neygbour.
And yet all those.vii. ben again contained in this one commandment of
Christ. Love thy neighbor as thy self. A declaracion of the said precepts.
The first.
yet may you go ferther with them / some what to teach them what they mean.
For whane you say that we may have no mo gods but one alone, that is to
mean, yt we should love nothing so well as god. When soever that a person
does sete his heart and mind upon any creature, more than upon god / so that
he would rather displease god and break his laws and ordynaunces, than for to
leave and forbere the affection or pleasure of the creature / than has he a
strange god: a another god, for tha^ that thing is his god / for ye which he
does forsake god, and does contrary unto his will and ordinance. And here
(good and devout christians) be well ware, and warn all yours of these
supersticious wytche crafts and charms that been much used: and done deceive
many persons, that (for ye unlawful love unto the health of their bodies, or
of their children, or beasts, or other goods lost or stole^) will go seek
wysme^ or wysewome^ (for so they don call ye deuels proctours that done use
such wytchcraftes and charms) the^ do^ they seek I say, and put them felfe
subject unto the false god the devil and his cerimonyes, to get health
unlawfully by the means of that wytchecrafte forboden by the church, under
pain of cursynge. And yet the simple people, done suppose and wene they do
nothing offend therein. For I have herd them say full often my self. Sir we
mean well / and we done believe well / and we think it a good and charitable
deed to hele a seek person / or a seek be: and troth they say / but yet it
is neither good ne charitable to help ye by unlawful means. And suerly yt
mean is unlawful. For good reason will admit, that no sore sekenes may be
heeled, but either by nature, or by medicine, or by miracle. If a finger be
cut, or small surfeit taken: nature in a while will heel the person. But in
all grievous diseasis, medicine is the common mean of health: but sure ben they
that such charms or wytchcraftes be no medicines. For tha^ should they heel
as well by one person as by a another. And no man byleueth they ben miracles
ergo they must nedely by the deuels craft, that do deceive the simple
persons: does hurt some, and teached yt way unlawfully to bring them in
his danger. For you will grant that he were a fool, that for the health of
his horse leg, would lose one of his own hands, or one of his own eyes /
and yet is he more fool in deed: tha^ for any creature would lose his soul.
But yet some have said to me. Sir / how may this charm be evil or a mys,
wha^ all things be good / as by example. The charmer is a good man or a good
woman, and takes here a piece of white bread, and said over ye bread
nothing: but only the Pater noster, and makes a cross upon the bread /
which things ben all good, tha^ does he nothing else but ley yt piece of bread
unto the toth yt aketh or unto any other sore: tournynge the cross unto the
sore or disease, and so is the person heeled. How may this be evil now say
they? I say again it is evil and dampnable, because the faith and believe of
the hole matter rests in that applycacion of the cross, which has no
natural operacion, but is a cerimony unlawful. For although all other things
here ben good, yet done they nothing avail without yt cerymony, and so is all
a charm and unlawful and naught, which may euydently be known for naught
and unlawful, because the church does condemn and forbede all such, which
thing surely ye learned church of god, guyded ever by ye holy ghost would never
have done, if it were good and lawful. And therefore in any wise, let none of
your folks use any such. The second.
Now for ye second precepte, which is yt no person should take ye name of
god in vain, warn your folks and take good head unto the^ yt they be no
common swerers. For it were less ieopardy for you to have in your house a
thief or a steler, a lecher or vnclen liver, tha^ an usual swerer. For a great
oath accustomed, does provoke ye sodeyne vengeance of god The scripture says
De domo iura^tis non recedet plaga. The customable swerer, Ecclesi. xxiii. b.
shall ever be full of iniquite and sin / and the plage of ye vengeunace of
god shall contynually ha^ge over that house. Ibidem.
Let not thy mouth be used unto swerynge (says ye scripture) For ye customable
swerer shall never be clean purged of syn^e. Wherefore I dare well say yt
swerynge is one of the great causes of all these sodeyne plages among men and
beasts, as pestilence, pockes, swetynges, and moreyns, with such other. And I
believe verily none of you would be glad to keep in his house a lepre, or any
person infected with any of the foresaid plages And yet is a swerer more
peryllous tha^ any of them. For his oath may slay or infecte your child in ye
cradle, or stryke your beasts in ye feeldes, destroy your corn and graynes,
and cause pryuely many myscheues. And yet many persons done think and believe,
that if they swear troth, they do no sin, but they be surely deceived, as by
case. If a person would prynte and coin monye of good silver or good gold,
keeping also the due weyghte and facion, that thing would nothing excuse the
person unto the king or his laws, though also he proved the money were good
and lawful money. For ye kings law is / that no person shall prynte or toyne
any money but such as be assygned by him, and that also in the place appointed
thereunto. So in like manner, the law of god is: yt no person shall swear any
oath / except it be at the appoyntemente or commandment of such a person
that has just power to require and to take an oath, and that also must be
done in due place, that is to say, before a lawful judge. And so may the
person lawfully swear, so ever that the swerer do think and believe in true
and unfeigned conscience, that his oath is true. And else that is to say without
these circumstau^ces and such other causes expressed in the law no person
may swear, though it be never so true that he swereth. If than to swear true is
sin, and does provoke ye high displeasure of god, by cause it is contrary
unto his commandment, to swear false must needs be more sin, and more
provoke his vengaunce. Example shall I show here of both, that is to say, how
god is provoked by usual swerynge, and how by forswerynge and false oaths.
This story yt follows I herd at Stondo^ a little vylage.xxv. miles from
London not far from ye high way unto Ca^brydge / where for a time I did
abide in avoiding yt great piage yt both in London and Cambrydge did than
quyckely and sharply reyne, where also this story was open in the knowledge of
all ye country there about, as don but small time before. A gentylman yt was
called master Baryngton whose wife was afterward married in Ca^brydge unto a
gentylman called master Caryngton, so yt there was but one lettre changed in
her name, yt is to say C. for B. And of her also I herd the same story,
although (as she said) she was not present. This said ge^tylma^ Baryngto^ was a
great swerer, and did customably use great oaths: specially by the blood of
our lord, or (as more co^munely they swear) by gods blood. And upon a so^day
or else a feestfull holy day he went forth on hu^tyng or hawkynge: and nothing
spedyng after his mind, he came unto an alehous at a throughfare called
Pulcriche.v. miles from ware in ye high way to Ca^brydge ye one side of ye
which thorough fare was in ye said parisshe of Sto^do^, where this gentylman
was, and called for drynk: and anon he began to swear after his unhappy
custom saying. By gods blood this day is unhappy. And in a while after in
sweryng so, he bledde at ye nose, and therewith more vexed he begane to rail
and rain god (as they say) in swerynge gods passyo^, gods wounds, gods
flesh, gods nails, and ever his holy and blessed blood, till at the last
he fell ferther to blede at the ears, at ye eyes, at his wrestes, and all the
joints of his hands, and of all his body, at his nauyll and foundemente, and
of other places of his body, in meruelouse great qua^tite and st^emes of blood,
and shotynge cut his tongue in a marvelous horrible, vgs^^e and ferefull manner,
as black as pitche so that no person durst come nere him but stead a far
of, and cast holy water toward him / and so he conteynued ever swerynge /
blasphemynge and bledynge / iyll he expyred and was deed. And the more we after
they laid him in a carte / and carried him to the said church of Stondon, and
ever the body blede till he was buried in ye way as they came in very great
haboundau^ce. This was a plain toke^ that god was much displeased with that
swerynge, and did openly punysshe the same / in example to all usual swerers.
It may also be a good monicion and warning for such persons that done
mysevse the holy day in hawkyng hunting and such other fruytles occupacions
or pastymes. A another example of the same usual sweryng was showed unto me by
a bacheler of divinity called master George wercke / a fellow tha^ where I
was also fellow, of the queen's colege in Cambrydge, and after he was vycare of
Harowe on the hill, which thing he said upon his conscience. He saw him
self in a merchants house in London, which was his special friend, and
sent for him to give counseyle unto the same person, a young man that was
prentyse: or else servant unto the same marchaunte / which yongman did use to
swear for his commune oath / by the bones of god: or by gods bones. And it
came to pass that he was taken with a great marvelous sekenes, so that no
Physyke ne medicine might help ne ease him, but that he lay still in bed so
long, that the flesh and the skin of his arms and fyngers, and of his
legs, thyes, shynnes / fete and toes / did deuyde in sondre / as though they
had been slytte with a knyfe, so that ye bare bones might openly be seen and
feled. And so in the same manner / (after he had with great contricion and open
confession of that swerynge) received the sacraments of the church / he
departed this life unto our lord. Here been now two notable examples of
usual swerynge. The third shall I show you of forswerynge, or false sweryng,
which was showed unto me of an honest priest of my familier acquaintance that
was vycare of Halywell, where saint Wenefredes well is, beside the abbey of
Basyng work in Flynt shyre in the borders of Wales.xiiii. miles from
Westchester, which thing he said on his conscience he did se him self and
was there present with great multitude of other people thousands. A certain
man was called to be sworn in a great matter between two parties, which said
parties did put the matter holy unto the determination of his oath, and met
both at a certain place where was a crucifixe: a holy rode that did many
miracles, whereupon he should swear, and so did in the sight and herynge of a
great multitude of people gathred on both parties. And his oath given, he laid
both his hands upon the fete of ye rode / and swear false and contrary unto
his conscience, and so was dampnably forsworn, which thing god would have
known. For wha^ he would have taken his hands away to depart, both the
hands cleued and stycked fast unto ye fete of ye rode, as though they had be^
glued or fastened with nails thereunto. And than he would with violence have
pulled them of: and than with sterynge and hasty mouyng to and fro, the step
whereupon he stood: slypped and voyded from him. And than hanged he still by
his hands, and so remained hanging still contynually the space of three days,
and marvelous much people came thither to se and look upon him, of the which
many ben yet lyuyge. So at the last after three days wha^ he had with great
contricion openly confessed his defaute / and received the sacraments of the
church, when ye people supposed and thought verily he should there have
expired and died he was suddenly losed and delivered / and lived many years
after a good and holy life / unto the glory of God and great example of them yt
been swerers. Lib. iiii. cap xviii
* Saint Gregory in his dialoges does show of a child, yt (as he had herd of
other persons) did swear great oaths, and had pleasure therein, and suddenly
when he was swerynge in his fathers lap upon his kne / the devil came and
openly rauysshed and by violence took him from his father / and carried him away
/ that he was never seen after. Here may you perceive the great peril and
ieopardy of sweryng. For ye love of our lord therefore good devout christians,
take good head thereto / as well in your self as in your folks. And yet should
you have no less guard or awayte unto lyeng, or making of lies or lesynges.
For the lie or lesynge is very mother unto both the defautes showed last
before / that is to say, unto perjury or forsweryng, Mendacium.
and unto false wytnes. For eueryche of these daughters / is worse than the
mother. For ye liar cares little to bear false wytnes / and every liar is
co^munely a swerer / for else the lie should not be colored / dubbed and painted
sufficiently to seem true, and specially in a defaute whereof the liar would
feign be excused for dread of punyssheme^t or rebuke, or wha^ a matter should
(by that lie) come to pass / and be brought about unto effect, for profit,
advantage, flatery or pleasure. For wha^ the liar does coueyte most subtelly
to deceive and feign and gladly would be byleued, tha^ does ye liar most
lyberally lasshe out oaths, and sparethe for no cost (as they say) but wha^
such a person does swear most, tha^ will a wise person believe him lest. And
by this does appear, that the commune and besy swerers been suspecte to be
liars. For the liar is combred so in conscience, that he supposes and thinks
he can not be byleued without he swear many oaths, and great oaths. Beware
therefore of liars. For common liars been communely thieves or pyckers, and
unclean lyuers. And (to say the troth) the liar is (...) and disposed unto all
manner (...)ces, because that all liars (...) chylder of ye devil. For th(...)
was the first liar, and eve(...) co^tynue a liar. And as the g(...) says, he
is the father of all (...) Now ponder and wey (go(...)uoute christians) I pray
you, if you were required whether you would be co^tente to keep in your company
a thief or pyker, a person yt should enforce and labor to corrupt your wives
/ or your daughters / or yet such a person that were servant or child unto
your deedly foo or enemy, I think you will say nay, you would keep no such.
Than say I beware of the liar / for all commune liars ben the deuyls children,
and done follow their father the devil, whose properte and natural disposicion
is to lie. I cane well grant yt you (...)give and pardon them yt done (...),
pyke, or do lechery: for ones (...)yse, and labor and look for (...)ery and
amendment, but in (...)yse can I grant that you (...)on the liars, but even
forth(...) you would cure the sodeyne (...)lence: so correct and punysshe y^
lie. Wherefore I have set out here a pretty lesson, which I pray you teache your
children, and every child ye comes i^ to your company you shall (I trust) do
much good thereby.

If I lie, backebyte or stele
If I curse, scorn, moke, or swear
If I chyde, fight, strive or threte
Than am I worthy to be beat
Good mother: or maystres mine
If in any of these nine:
I trespass to your knowing
With a new rod and a fine
Erly naked / before I dyne:
Amend me with a scourgynge.
And than I pray you fulfill and perform their peticio^ and request, and
think it not cruelly / but mercifully done. For ye wise man says, Prouer^
xiii d
who spares the roode: hates the child. And in a another place. Eccle vii. c
If thou have children (says he) correct them betyme / and hold the^ vnd
while they been young, your daily practyse does show unto you / y^ if you
powder your flesh while it is new and sweet / it will continue good meat:
but if it smell before it be powdered, all the salt you have shall never make it
seasonable. Powder your children therefore betyme and than you love them, and
shall have conforte of them. I did appoynte ye correction before unto ye mother
or maystres, for communely they done take the labor of that mynistery and
service. Notwithstanding there may be said father or master, and the staff
or foot of the ryme be all one. But who so ever do ye correction, wheder it be
in lasshes, or in words, let it be done with the charity of our lord / and with
a myld and soft spirit: that ever it be done for the reformacio^ of the
person / rather than for the reuengynge of the defaute, and therefore should
you never do any manner of correction while you be vexed, chafed, troubled,
wroth, or angry for any cause, but rather for that time defer the correction,
and a another time by good delyberacyon take the persons on part / or if the
trespass be openly known, than do it openly, yt all the lokers thereupon may be
warned thereby, and give the^ a good lesson before the correction / and tell
them you do the correction against your mind compelled thereunto by conscience,
and require them to put you no-more unto such labor and pain. For if thou do
(say you) you must suffer part of the pain with me / and therefore you shall
now have experience and prove what pain it is to us both. And than pay
truly, and afterward forthwith forgive them clerly and gentelly / so that
they do no more so. And in doing thus correction / you may edyfye and refourme
the persons / and also merit and have thank of our lord. Where if contrary
you chyde brawle, curse, and with ungoodly words rebuke, or stryke with
hastynes to revenge your own cause or appetyte / you shall render the persons
more stubbourne and styffe hearted, and engendre in them an hatered toward you.
And also not only lose your merit, but also deserve pain and the punyssheme^t
of god, where the other correction done by sobrenes, shall cause the perso^es
to have you in a reuere^de dread, and also to love you, and here afterward to
bliss you, and pray for you. I pray you therefore, win and deserve both their
blyssynge and prayer / and also the blyssyng and reward of our lord. But
because that communly all persons done use to swear some oath / in affirmynge
or denyinge / that is in saying ye, as grauntyng, or nay, as denyinge, which
be seldom said nakedly by them self without some addicio^, therefore I would
have you in auoydyng of all vain oaths to teach your children to make their
addicio^s under this form. ye father, nay father: ye mother / nay mother: ye
brother / nay brother: ye sister / nay sister: ye sir / nay sir: ye dame / nay
dame: or unto ye states, master / maistres / and so forth of all such common
terms / as graundfather, graundmother: godfather, godmother: uncle, aunte,
cosyn / and such like / without any other addicion, or any of these found
oaths, as by cock and pie, by my hode of grene, and such other. For Christ
says in the gospel unto his disciples. Math. v
Swear not you at all (says he) in any wise, yt is to mean unlawfully or in
vain. And the prophet says. Psalmo. lxii.
* Laudabuntur oe^s qui iura^t in eo: quia obstructu^ est os loquentium iniqua.
That is those persons that done lawfully swear in god, shall be praised and have
reward therefore, and the mouth of evil spekets shall be stopped / and they put
to shame and rebuke. All this have we spoken for the keeping of the second
precepte or commandment. The third precepte.
Now for the third commandment. I pray you give good example in your own
self, and tha^ teache all yours how they should keep duly the holy day, that
is to say (in asmoche as conuenientely may be) to be void of all manner of
worldly and bodyly labors. I said in asmoche as conveniently may be. For
people must have meat and drink / the houses must be appareyled / beasts
must be cured and looked unto. And very unfeigned necessite or need does excuse
in conscience. The holy day is ordained of god and the church, only for the
service of god. The due place of ye service is the church. unto all the^ that
may conveniently come thereunto. And to them that may not / every honest place
of good and lawful occupacion is their church. For God is there present
where he is duly and devoutly served. Take the pain therefore wha^ you may to
go forth your self / and call your folks to follow. And wha^ you ben at ye
church, do nothing else but that you came for, and look often times upon them
that been under your charge, that all they be occupied, like (at the leest)
unto devout christians. Mathei xxi.
For ye church (as our savior says) is a place of prayer, not of claterynge
and talkyng. And charge them also to keep their sight in ye church cloce upon
their books or bedes. And while they ben young / let them use ever to knele /
stand or syte / and never to walk in the church. And let them here the mass
quyckly and deuotly / much part knelynge. But at the gospel / at the preface
/ and at the Pater noster, teache the^ to stand, and to make curtesy at this
word Jesus, as the priest does. Thus in the fore noone let the time be spente
all in the seruys of god. And than in ye after noone, must you appoynte them
their pastyme with great diligence and strayte commandment. First that in no
wise they use such vanities as communely ben used, that is to say /
berebaytynge and bulbaytynge, foteball, tenesplaynge / bowlyng, nor these
unlawful games of cardynge, dycynge, closshynge / with such other unthrifty
pastymes, or rather losetimes: wherein (for a suerty) the holy day may rather
be broken, than if they went to the ploughe or carte upon Ester day, so it were
not done by co^tempte or dispisynge of the commandment of the law, ne for
unreasonable couetyse and love of worldly goods. For sin does always more
defoule and break the holy day than does any bodily work or occupacion.
Therefore let them beware of the tavern and alehouse / for dread of dronkennes,
or of glotony, and of suspecte places / or wanto^ company, for fere of
uncleanness / or lechery / which things been unto youth most peryllous / and
of great danger and ieopardy of corrupcion. Assign you therefore and appoynte
you them the manner of their disportes, honest ever and lawful for a reasonable
recreacio^ / and (asmoche as conuenie^tly may be (let the sexes be departed in
all their disportes, that is to say: the kinds, me^ by them self / and the
women by them self. And also appointe the time or space, that they be not (for
any disportes) from the service of god. Appoynte the^ also the place, that you
may call or send for them when case requires. For if there be a sermon any
time of the day, let them be there present all that been not occupied in
needful and lawful busynes / all other laid a part, let them ever keep the
preachynges, rather tha^ the mass, if (by case) they may not here both. To
bye and sell or bargayne upon the holy day / is unlawful: except it be for
very need. Charity unto the poor and nedy neighbors, does lawfully excuse
bodily or worldly labors upon the holy day. Look well you neither do ne say
wylfully, and by deliberacio^ upon the holy day any thing that you know in
conscience, should be contrary unto the honor of god, and tha^ done you
justly keep your holy day. A very good sure pastyme upon the holy day, is to
read, or to here this book or such other good english books, and gather
thereunto as many persons as you can. For I tell you there should be no time
lost, ne mysspente upon the holy day. Let this poor lesson now co^tente
you for these three commandments of the first table, which (as I said) done
apperteyne and belong unto almighty God him self. A another short lesson
shall we set forth for the commandments of the second table. The.iiii.
precepte.


And first the due reverend honor to be done of ye children unto the
parents, that is to say / unto their fathers and mothers, Teache your children
therefore to ask blessing every night knelynge, before they go to rest under
this form. * Father I beseech you of blessing for charity: or thus. Mother I
beseech you of charity give me your blessing. Than let ye father or mother
hold up both the hands, and ioynyng them both to gether, look up reverently
and devoutly unto the heaven, and say thus. Our lord god bless you child, and
therewith make a cross with the right hand over the child / sayng. In nomine
patris et filii and spu^s sancti. Amen. And if any child be styffe hearted /
stubburne and froward, and will not thus ask blessing, if it be within age,
let it surely be whysked with a good rod, and be compelled thereunto by force.
And if ye persons be of forther age, and paste such correction, and yet will
be obstynate, let the^ have such sharp and grievous punysshement as
conuenyently may be devised, as to fyt at dinner alone and by the^ self at a
stole in the mydle of the hal / with only brown bread and water, and every
person by order / to rebuke them as they would rebuke a thief or a traitor.
Deute. xxi. d.
For in ye old law such children were brought before the hole townshype,
that is to say, the people of the cite, or of that town, and there were they
stoned unto death. And certeynly I would not advise ne counseyle any parents, to
keep such a child in their house, without great affliction and punysshement.
And therefore I think it were much conuenie^te for there pare^tes, often times
to show unto their children what commodyties and profytes, and what perils
and ieopardies done follow the honor and dishonor of the pare^tes,
according unto holy scripture. Some whereof I have here set forth as is
contained in the book of the wise man called Ecclesiasticus, Ecclesi. iii. a
in the third chapitre. Those persons (says he) that been the children of
Christ / ben also ye children of his church, and all such (as though it were
by natural disposicion) ben given and applied of that godly disposicion unto
obedience and love. All you therefore that been loving children, be ever obedient
unto the judgment and discrecion of your pare^tes. And so be you obedient in
all your works, that you thereby may be the children of salvation, that is to
say, that your obedience be done with the very love of your heart, unfeigned
and without dissymulacion. For god has ordained that the father shall have due
honor among his children, and the mother in like manner with lowly obedience.
Those persons yt done love god, will pray unto him for the forgyuenes of their
sins, and afterward will beware co^teyne and keep them self from them. And
in ye daily prayer they shall graciously be herd. And like as a person for
the surete of his living here does horde up and gather treasure / so done they
ordeyne for the suerte of their salvation that duly done honor their
parents. This word parents does sygnifye both ye father and mother. Who so
ever does due^y honor his pare^tes shall have joy, pleasure, and conforte
among his own children. And who so ever is duly obedient unto the father,
does thereby refresshe and much comfort ye mother And these persons that
done due honor unto their pare^tes, shall have long life, and in the day of
their prayer they shall gracyously be herd of our lord, and have their
petycion. Those persons that have a reverend dread unto our lord god, have
in like manner a reverend dread unto their parents / and done duly honor
them, and will do them such service, and in like manner as a bond servant
sh^ld do unto his lord and master, as well in work as word, with all patience
and gentylnes. Do therefore to your pare^tes honor and reverence, that the
blessing of God may thereby light upon you, and that blessing shall remain
and endure unto your last end. The blessing of the parents does fyrme and
make stable ye possessions and the kynred of the children. And contrary, the
curse of the parents does eradicate and rotewalt and utterly destroy both.
Child, never take thou pleasure ne pride in the rebuke and disprayse of thy
parents.. For that rebuke is not thy glory, boste, nor praise, but rather thy
confusyon, shame and rebuke. For the glory and praise of every person,
stands in ye honor of the pare^tes. And a great shame and rebuke is it unto
the children, when the parents been without honor and reverence. Good
children take good patience with the age of your parents, and never displease
ne grieve them in all your life. And if they fail i^ wit or understanding,
and thereafter speak or do any thing contrary unto your reason or wit / take
you patience with them, and let ye matter pass. And in no wise do you not
despise the^, because of your own strength or better abilite. For the pity and
compassion that you have unto your pare^tes, shall never be forgoten before
God. For you shall have good and profit of their offense and sin. And in the
justice and right you do unto them shall you be edifyed, and encreace in
virtue. And i^ the time of your trybulacio^, that good deed shall be remembrede.
For as the ice in the frost does melte by the clear son beams, so shall your
sins (by your duty done unto your pare^tes be wasted and clean losed and for
given. That person is of evil name and fame that does forsake the parents in
their need. And those children been accursed of god, that done anger, vex, and
trouble their parents. Child of what state or degree so ever thou be, do ever
thy duty with myldenes, mekenes, and lowlynes, and than shall thou be well
byloued, and praised above other persons. And ye more high estate thou come
unto, ye more meke and lowly be thou in all things, and tha^ shall thou in ye
presence of god have great merit, and increase in grace. For God does look
upon the^ that done render and give due thanks, for the favor and goodness
done unto them before. Ad verdum serme translata.
All this now is the very text and lettre of the holy scripture in the place
before rehearsed. Where you may se and perceive many great commodytes and graces
that done come unto them that duly don honor their pare^tes. And many great
ieopardyes and peryles, and also the curse of god / that does light upon the^
that will not do their duty of honor and reverence unto their parents. Let
therefore your children use and accustom the^ self, daily to ask their
fathers and mothers blessings. For this dare I say, that although in case the
father or mother were an abhomynable sinner, Er Gre. lib. d alo. iii. ca. vii.
or excommunycate, accursed / or an heretyke, and though ye child were so
also. yet might that cross of the blessing of that father or mother save that
child from sodeyne myschefe, that else might have come unto that child. And
ye cross may also do flee or chase away evil spirits, that else should have
had power upon that child. The blessing of every good person is good and not
without great virtue, according unto ye power and degree of the persons and
therefore teache the^ also to ask blessyng of every bisshope, abbote and every
priest, and of their godfathers and godmothers, with other devout persons.
And let this suffyse for this fourth commandment. yet go ferther unto the
fyfthe commandment, which is to kyl or sle no person. Teache the^ there /
that it is not enough yt they put no person to death by stroke of hand or
wepe^, but also that they hurt no person in name or fame by detraction,
backebytyng or sclau^derynge, or by evil example of living, nor yet that they
curse or banne or wysshe evil unto any person, or yet hate any person in
heart. i. Ioh. iii.
For (as scripture says) who so ever does bear in the heart or mind any
hatered, malice, evil will, or stomach against any christian, is an
homicide, that is a mansleer or a manqueller. Many persons will say they ben
in charity, and have no hatered unto any person, and yet will they not speak
one to a another and that is a sign and token that preuy hatered is in the
heart, and yt they do not love their neighbor as the^ self, in the true and
unfeigned charity of our lord. And sure it is, yt who so ever does not holy
and fully love his neyghbore, i. Johan. iiii. d.
whom he may se and behold with his bodyly sight, he cane never love god /
whom he cane not se, nor so behold. This is than the commandment of God:
that who so ever does love god must also love his neighbor. The.vi. precepte.
The syxthe commandment is that no lechery be done / which is not mente
only for the unlawful deed, but also for all manner of prouocacion thereunto /
as wanton and light behauyours, in kissing, clyppynge, and unclean touching,
Math. v d.
a light look or cast of the syghte, with a desire and consent of heart unto
the deed, does break this commandment. Much more than does rybauldy break
it, and such manner as before is said. The old proverb says. Who so will
none evil do: should do nothing that longs thereto. The ghostly enemy does
deceive many persons by the pretense and color of matrymony, in
pryuate-secrete contractes. Contractes.
For many men when they cane not obtain their unclean desire of the woman,
will promise marriage, and thervpo^ make a contracte promise, and give faith
and troth each unto other saying. Here I take the. N. unto my wife, and thereto
plyght ye my troth. And she again unto him in like manner. And after ye done /
they suppose they may lawfully use their unclean behauyoure / and sometime the
act and deed does follow, unto ye great offense of god and their own souls.
It is a great ieopardy therefore to make any such contractes, specially among
them self secretly alone without records, which must be two at ye leest.
For many times after the unlawful pleasure is paste, discord does fall
between the parties, either because that (as the common proverb says) hot
love is sone cold, ii. Regu^. xiii. c
or else by the means of their friends, or by some couetyse to have a better
marriage they or one of them done deny the contracte, and so unlawfully done
mary otherwise and live in aduoutry all their life time. And because ye church
cane not openly know ye thing that was spoken and done in priuyte, they been
thought and supposed so to live as lawfully in marriage, where in deed before god
they done live as noughty packes in dampnable aduoutry and unlawful lechery,
and all their children bastardes before God, all though they seem otherwise
unto the world. Warn therefore your folks there be no such blind bargaynes in
your house or governance. The.vii. commandment is, do not theft. Herin
correct your young persons betyme. The.vii. precepte.
For the child that begins to ^yke at a pynne or a point, will after pyke
a penny or a pound. And so go forth from an apple unto an ox, and from a pere
to a purse, or an horse, and so from the small things unto the great. When you
take any child therefore with the mayner, be it never so little a thing: pay
truly at the first time, and the second time: and prycke the pynnes or the
points upon the cappe or shulder in open sight, and let all the house wonder
upon the^ and cry all: here is the thief, this is the thief, se se the thief.
And if they me^de not thereby, let the^ be so brought through the open streets
with shame enough, and cruel punysshement. For better is it that ye child
wept in youth, and suffer shame and rebuke, than herafter the father, mother
and friends should weep for sorrow and shame at his hangyng and shamfull death.
And let every person beware of theft For all other sins with contricyon /
confession and penance / may be forgyue^ clearly, but theft and all goods
unlawfully gote^ / can never be forgyue^ unto the time that restitucio^ be made
that is to say, unto the time those goods / or the valor of them be
restored, if the persons (in any wise) may be able thereunto. Let every
person po^der well and wey, what vau^tage it is to stele or pyke, sith (beside
the pain certaynely to be suffered in hell) the same goods (in valor) must be
restored again. Small goods truly gote^, done grow and increase unto the
great conforte of the persons- And contrary, evil gote^ goods lightly come
(as they say) and lightly go, all wast unto naught, with ye disconfort of the
parties / and great combraunce of conscience. Se than yt all goods be well
gotten among you. Of ye.viii. The. viii precepte.
commandment you have before some remembrance in the lessons of sweryng and
lyeng. The.ix. The.ix. precepte.
commandment is that no person shall desire in mind nor wyshe yt the wedded
make of any other person were lawfully their weded make. The.x. precepte.
And the.x. commandment is in like manner of the goods. For so should the
parties have incommodite, loss, displeasure or disconforte. The deeds of these
two commandments were forboden of god in the.vi. and.vii. commandments,
here now been the wylles and desires forbode^. That thing than that no man
may lawfully will: may no man do lawfully. Let them therefore beware that do
not only will and desire in mind / but also done secretly, pryuely / and
craftily labor to take their neighbors fermes, or his house (as they say)
over his heed, or to entyce and get away their servants, or any other goods
profitable for the parties. For though such things may seem unto the world
lawful, surely they be not without the great offense of god / as contrary unto
his commandments. And thus an end of the.x. commandments. Of the seven
pri^cipall sins.
yet must you have a lesson to teache your folks to beware of the seven
pryncipall sins, which ben co^munely called the.vii. deedly sins, but in
deed they do call them wrong, for they been not always deedly sins. Therefore
they should be called capital or principal sins: and not deedly sins.
These been their names by order, after our division. Pride / Envy / Wrath
Couetyse / Glotony / Sloth / and Lechery. Thus don we order the^ / according
unto our three ghostly enemies / the devil / the world, and the flesh. For
Pride, Envy, and Wrath, done apperteyne and belong unto the devil, as chief
mouer of the^. And couetyse does apperteyne unto the world, as chief mouer
thereof. And glottony / sloth / and lechery, done belong unto ye flesh / as
their chief mouer, which three we done put under this order, because that
glotony is a great occasyon of sloth. For (as the proverb says) When the
belly is full, the bones would have rest. The full fed glotton is apt unto
no good work or labor, but rather all disposed unto sluggysshenes and
sloth. And those two between them done styre and provoke most unto lechery.

The.v. wits.
Teache them also to know ye names of the five wits, and to put the first
finger of the right hand unto the instruments of the same wits, that is to
say unto the ear, the eye, the nose, the mouth, and than to join and clappe
both the hands togeder, saying thus. Herynge, seeing, smelling, tastynge, and
touching.

The.vii. works of mercy.
It shall be also well done to teache the^ the.vii. works of mercy. which you
should (after your power) set forth in work as you teache the^ in voice. That is
to feed ye hu^gry. To give drink unto ye thursty. To cloth ye naked. Herborow
or lodge ye wayfarynge folks / or them that have need of lodging. Visit the
sick. Redeem ye prisoner. And bury the deed. Here is now an end hereof. A
form of confession.
Not wtsta^dyng I think it necessary to show here yet how as I learned of my
gostly father yt taught me all this lesson you should teache your folks to be
ordered unto ye confession of these things. For I have known many come unto
co^fessyo^, yt could not tell how to do, or what to say there. I shall
therefore set forth here a short form and manner thereof. For there ben many
forms of co^fessions in print set out at lengh. First good devout christians I
beseech you give no crede^ce unto the false heretykes, yt done deprave and set
naught by confession, nor by this holy sacrament of penance. For I acertayne
you those persons what so ever they be, yt (after their baptyme and
christendom) have done any deedly sin, cane never be in ye state of
salvation without the faith and will of confession. Gene. iii.
For almighty god in every law did require confession and provoke every
trespasser thereunto, as of our first parents Ada^ and Eve in paradyse, which
confessyo^ if they had mekely made, they and we should have suffered the less
pain. Leuit. iiii ^. v.
In ye old law special oblacions and sacrifyce was appointed openly by the
prestes to be done for such sins among the people yt were preuy unknown
unto all other persons, except only the self trespassers, whereby it must
needs be troth, that they were confessed thereof unto the prestes. Wha^ any
person also was suspecte of lepry, the judgment and determynacion thereof
remained (by ye ordinance of ye law) unto the priest. Which thing was a
plain figure of the sacrament of penance and confession. Math. v
And our sauyoure said, he came not to break the law: but rather to
accomplish and fulfill the law. And so he did confyrme and ratifye that law,
wha^ he sent the lepres that he cured and heled unto the prestes. Math. viii.
Luc. xvii.
And i^ every cure he did upon the syke persons, he expressed mystycally
co^fessyon, in that he caused them to show their disease before they were
cured. And saint Peter his apostle after his ascension, did require confessy^n
of a man called Ananye, Acto. v.
and of his wife called Saphirye (as appears in holy scripture) of a deedly
sin, which he (by the revelation of god) knew they had done / and because
they would not make confession thereof, they were both stryke^ to death with the
vengeance of god. Our mother holy church therefore has (by the inspiracio^ of
ye holy ghost) ordained that every person ye committee or do any deedly sin
i^ work, word, or by full deliberate co^sente in thougt, must nedely (if they
will be saved) be confessed thereof unto a priest. Sithe than all christian
people have received and used the same so many hundred years, take you that use
and custom for sufficient auctoryte to follow the same and to put all manner of
contrary opinion clean out of mind, and in no wise to here speak or talk
thereof. Now unto our matter. First teache your f^lkes to come reverently unto
the ghostly father with meke and sobre countenance and behauyour. (For it is
no laughing gain.) Than knele down at ye place appointed and there make a
cross upon the foreheed or fro^te, with In nomine patris (as before is showed)
and tha^ forth with say thus. Benedicite. And when the priest has answered,
than say (if the person be learned) Confiteor deo, beat Marie, omnibus
sanctis, et vobis, peccaui nimis, cogitatione, locutione, et opere mea culpa.
that is to say for the unlearned, I confess and knowledge my self gylty unto
our lord god, the blessed lady saint Marie, unto all the holy company of heaven
/ and unto you my ghostly father yt I have offended my lord god many times in
my life, and specially sith the last time of my confession, in thought, word,
and deed, in many and diverse ways, mo tha^ I can show, specially in the seven
pryncipall sins. Pride, envy and wrath, couetyse, glotony, sloth, and
lechery. And by them I have broken his commandments-

Pride.

For by ye syn^e of pride I have been presumptuous and disobedient unto god, and
have not loved hi^ above all things, but many times set more by mine own
frail appetyte and sensual desire. For where I should have desired ever the
laud and praise of our lord / and with all mekenes of heart accused my self /
I have contrary bosted my self, or desired and been glade of mine own praise
and been loath to be dispraysed. And when I have been challenged, reproved,
rebuked, or corrected, or yet charitably ben monysshed and warned of, and for
my defautes, I have rebelled there against, and not mekely received it but
rather ben ready to defend or to excuse my self, and sometime with a lie, or a
false oath. And for lack of reverend dread and love of our lord, I have by
presumpcion of pride taken his holy name in vain, and vnlawfuly sworn by god,
by our lady, or ye holy saints by my faith or truth, with such other. And
for very pride and presumption, and for lack also of love and dread: I have
mysvsed the holydaye, in things of pleasure, or profit unto my self, and not
in his service unto his honor. I have also (of high and proud heart or
mind) been disobedient and not done due honor and reverence unto my fathers
and mothers spiritual and carnal, ghostly and bodyly, nor unto mine elders
and betters, but have been many times full obstynate and froward unto them. I
cry God mercy. Thus (by this foul sin of pride) I have broken four of the
principal commandments of our lord, and many other ways have I also
offended therein. I beseech his grace of mercy and forgyuenes.

Envy.

I have also offended my lord god in the sin of envy: for I have not loved
my neighbor as my self, nor ben so charitable, so kind, so loving and
favorable unto all persons: as I would they should have been to me, but rather I
have (by suspicion) thought, iuged, said or herd of other persons, otherwise
than I would they should of me, nor ben so glade of their welthe, ne so sorry
for their hurt as I would have been of mine own. I cry god mercy.

Wrath.

In wrath also I have offended, for lack of due patience, and for light,
slyght. or small occasion, have leyghtly and soon ben styred and moved, wroth
and angry, wha^ any thing has been done or said contrary unto my mind. And
therewith have been ready to revenge the same with froward and ve^geable
countenance and behauyoure / with high, hasty, and ungoodly words, brawlyng,
chydyng, scoldyng, reuylynge, rebukynge, raylynge, vpbraydyng, thretyng,
cursyng, bannyng, sweryng. And if it came thereunto, in stryuyng, fyghtyng, or
(at the lest in will: as god forbede) i^ kyllyng or sleyng. Thus by these two
great sins of envy and wrath I have broken the.v. and the viii. commandment
of our lord, in them both. I beseech his grace of mercy and forgyuenes.

Couetyse.

In couetyse also I have sinned because I have not been content with the
goods, state, and degree of living that god has sent me where it is much
better than I have deserved, or am worthy, but I have coueyted and desired /
wysshed and wylled, studied and labored to have more (if any be unlawfully
gotten or so with holden, make plain co^fessyon thereof as the matter requires.)
Thus by this sin of couetyse have I broken the vii. commandment of our
lord and the tenth and otherwise dyuersly offended in couetyse. I beseech his
grace of mercy and forgyuenes.

Glotony.

I have also sinned in glotony, in taking meat and drink indiscreetly / and
above that nature did require, and have pycked out and chosen (sometime by
sensual appetyte) the delycate sweet and plesaunt meats and drynkes, rather
for pleasure tha^ for need / and taken thereof such superfluyte (at some times)
that I have been thereby sick or diseased, or at the least ben the more dull
both in body and soul, unto all manner of virtue and good exercises (look here
whether you have broken any fastes commanded by the law, or ben drunk, or
taken any notable surfeit) after meat commonly I have been more ready to pass
the time in bodyly disportes and ydlenes tha^ in labors. I cry god mercy.

Sloth.

I have be^ also much slothful and neglygent to serve God, both upon the
holy day and other days also, and I have been yrke weary, and thought ye time of
prayer long, come late thereunto, and make haste therein, and over passed the
service of god, without due reverence, more by course and custom than by any
good remembrance or devotion, and also I have not ben dilige^te to apply my
self unto such bodyly labors as I have had in charge and sometime have not
done the labors at all, or else full sleyghtly done them, and spent the time
after mine own appetyte full vnfruytfully, sometime in wantonness, and sometime
in very ydlenes. I cry god mercy.

Lechery.

By the means of these two foul sins of glotony and sloth / I have been
the more ready unto ye third sin of ye flesh, that is to say lechery, for I
have not been so chaste in soul and body as ye state / degree and manner of my
living does require, not so diligent and ready to put away unclean thoughts
or mocio^s of ye body as I should be / but rather followed the^ at so^tymes
wyllfully, and suffered them to hang upon me, and taken in them delectacion and
pleasure for the time. And when I have been in presence of company, I have not
always ordered my self in chaste manner in my lokes or syghtes, countenance and
behauyour, words and deeds, but many times have been full light to take or to
give occasyon. I cry god mercy. Here must you remember suit or prouocacio^
unto uncleanness, done or suffered on your behalf, as i^ words, wrytyngs, signs
tokens, messages, kissing, clyppyng, touching, or other more fylthy and
unlawful behauyoure / done in deed or in full consent. And so show every
thing with ye due circumstances, of ye time, place, and persons, not namynge
the persons, but showing the states or degrees of the^: as whether they he
married or unmarried. etc. Thus by this foul sin of lechery: have I broken
the.vi. and also.ix. commandment of god, and by many other means, as well in
this sin as in all the other of these.vii. pryncipall sins, have I
grievously offended my lord god, broken his commandments, not fulfilled ye
works of mercy unto my power, and mysvsed my five wits, in herynge, seeing,
smellyng, tastynge, and touching. For the which and for all other, as our
lord knows me gylty, and I would confess and knowledge if they came to mind,
I beseech his gracious goodness of mercy and forgyuenes. And you my ghostly
father of penance and absolucion. Et precor sanctam Mariam, omnes sanctos dei,
and vos orare pro me. Which is to mean unto the unlearned. And I beseech the
blessed lady saint Mary, all the holy company of heaven, and you also my
ghostly father to pray for me. And when you have taken your penance, and have been assoyled, than say you unto ye priest. Sir / and it please you, this is my
penance, and than rehearse the same ones or twyse your self / that you may the
more surely bear it in mind. For I assure you, it is ieopardeous (after learned
men) to forget the penance. And thus an end thereof. yet did I promise in the
beginning / to set forth here a forther exercise, which I think should be
good and profitable for all persons. For the common proverb is, that a great
benefyte or gift is worse than lost upon such unkind persons yt done not
remember it, ne give due thanks therefore. It should become therefore every
faithful christian to have ever in mind the great and excellent benefyte of
our salvation. And therefore have I devised here a short table, that does (in
some) conteyne the hole life of our sauyoure Jesus, that such persons as will
can it by heart, and have it ready in mind may lightly order and lay up as it
were treasure in a cheste or cofre, all such matters of the gospel, and that
done appertain unto the acts of our savior, as been preached where they ben
present, or that they don here any good communycacions or redynges. And also
over this / they shall have two great profytes hereby, one is: that no remedy
may better ne sooner chase away all temptacions, and put the ghostly enemies
to flight, than this remembrance. The second is, that nothing in this world
may rather ne more spedefully move a dull heart unto devotion, and unto
contynuau^ce of virtue, than this exercise. I beseech you all therefore, in
visceribus Jesus christi: that is to say, for the tender love of our lord god
and most sweet savior Jesus: give some labor and diligence thereunto, and
daily use the same. It is but short and therefore may it soon be had by heart.
And it is very sweet, pleasant and profitable, and therefore should be received
with god will and diligence.

The self table of remembrance.

resurrection.



unto the end of the world. Amen. you now will think this table over long
for a daily exercise, but you must remember that the self table is contained
in the first words of every article, and the resydue is a breue declaracion of
the same, and therefore I shall be content to set it out alone in self words,
which ben in no^mbre.xl.

Thus.

Incarnation / Natiuite / Circumcision / Epypham / Presentation / Egypt /
Disputacio^ / Humiliacio^ / Educacio^ / Baptysme / Wilderness / Fast,
Te^ptacio^ / Victory / Election / Preaching / Teaching / Labors / Miracles /

Bisshopes / Pylate / Herod / Pylate again / Examinacio^ / Flagellacion /
Coronacion / Condemnation / Fatigation / Crucifixio^ / Sepulture / Resurrection
/ Ascension / Mission.

The end.

Now you may se this table is not long, but may easily be had by heart, and if
it so be, and daily used: I dare well say the persons shall find conforte
therein, both to exclude vice / and also to increase in virtue and grace. And
yet forthermore to co^tynue therein unto their conforte and joy everlasting
whereunto he bring us that bought us our lord god and most sweet savior Jesus,
who guide you and keep you all. Amen.

The householder.

Thus have I now (in dischargynge of my conscience) done and fulfilled the
cownsell and bidding of my ghostly father that taught me this lesson, which
cownsell was, that I should call you all before me: as well my wife and
children, as mine other servants, men / women, and children, and to teache you
this said and same lesson that he taught me. Now I pray you all and charge you
to do your deuoyr and diligence to follow it and use it.

Also he delivered unto me an other pretty lesson, which was not his own
work, but of his translation as follows, and bad me also teache it you.

A breue or short monycio^ or counseyle of the cure and governance of a
household, according unto policy. Taken out of a pystle of a great learned man,
called Bernarde Siluestre, and put among ye works of saint Bernarde for
because that many done judge and think hit was his own work.

Set forth by the same brother.

First good devout christians / take most head, and give most diligence to
order your self and all youres, unto our lord, according unto the poor
lesson that goes before / and than se well unto the substance / and guydyng
of your house / and goods. Se first that peace be in the house / and that you
agree all together / for else all your goods will sone goo to naught. Than
(after the commune proverb) cut your tho^ges: after, or according unto your
ledder. Spend according unto your gaynes / gettings / or re^tes / and not
above. It is also good policy / to have one years rent / or a years gaynes in
store for chau^ces, which is not contrary unto christianite where extreme, or
very streyte need / is not perceived in the neighbor. A negligent or rechles
person may soon set on fire, and destroy great substance. Have therefore a
good eye / and guard unto the diligence of your servants, for under the^ your
goods may soon mynushe / and be wasted before you know / beware or have
knowledge thereof / If your goods begin to waste better is, and less rebuke
for you to absteyne, and withdraw your charges / than to fall in to nedynes /
or danger. An old proverb. Qui plus expe^dit quam reru^ copia tendit. No^
admiretur si paupertate grauetur. That is. * Who so done spend beyond their
faculte / No marvel though with need they grieved be.

It is therefore a great providence, and good foresyght often to count / and
compare your goods, and your gaynes with your expenses. Often to ouerse your
goods, shall be necessary. For your beasts may take hurt for defaute of fode,
all though they nothing ask ne compain. Aristotl. i^ Econo.
The stepp of the husband: makes a fat donghyll. And the eye of the
master: a fat horse. that is to mean. that the presence of the master: in
every corner / is much profitable. Sumptuous and costly weddynges or brydales:
be^ damage / without honor. Expe^ses done upon war: ben more honorable,
than profitable. Better is to suffer some wrong, and to bye peace, than to
make war, or to keep war. Cost made upon prodigal persons? is clearly
lost. Cost made upon kynne, friends? is reasonable. Feed your household
servants: with honest commune fare / without delicates. For ye servant that
is made a gloto^, shall never after mende his manners. Glotony is vile, fylthy,
and stynkyng, and will make the negligent and careless person soon roten and
short lived. Ecclesi. xxxi.
Mean fedyng with scarcite: is unto the diligent person / pleasant and
profitable. upon the holidays and high feasts: give your household plenty of
meat, but seldom and few delicates. For the use of delicate fode / will
soon mar a good servant. Let glotony and thy purse strive, and go to law
together: and beware thou well, which part thou take, but for the most
part always hold with the purse. For glotons, men of law, and witnesses /
done speak all of affection, but the purse brings in plain evidence and
proof, the empte barn and ye empte bag. But if very negardy shut up thy
purse, than art not thou an even judge. For nygardy is a folysihe and nedeles
fere / and ever living in pouerte, and hourdeth and muckereth up: he can not
tell for whom. If you have plenty of corn desire no derth. For those persons
that of covetous mind done procure or desire derth, done procure and desire
the death of ye poor, and shall be accused: as homicides and ma^steers. Sell thy
corn better chepe unto thy neyghbure (althouhg he were thine enemy) tha^ unto
strangers. For an enemy is sometime sooner vaynquysshed and ouercomen by a
kind deed / than by the sword. Be never at debate with thy neyghbure, but
rather study / and labor to be at one. For you can have none so sure a
castle / or guard of thy life: as is the love and frendshype of thy neghbure.
If thou suspecte the women of thy house: let other persons rather show the /
tha^ you should be over busy to try out ye matter. For though it were of thine
own wife / or the wife of the husband: it were better unknown. For ones
known, it is never cured / ye wound is without remedy. If any remedy be: it
shall be when like chance is herd of other persons. The lest and most easy way
therein: is to dissimule the matter though it were pryuely known / and pretend
ygnorau^ce without any quarrel or co^tenaunce, but rather by a dyscrete ghostly
father let the parties be reformed yt sin be not continued. A noble heart /
and high gentle mind: will never search of wome^s matters. A sh^ew will sooner
be corrected by smyling or laughing: than by a staff / or strokes. The best
way to keep a woman good: is gentle entreaty, and never to let her know yt
she is suspected / and ever to be counseyled and informed with loving manner. An
old woman unclean of living (if ye law would suffer) should be buried quycke.
Let your clothing or array, Of array.
be in a mean, nor vile ne precious, but always, fair and honest / and of sad:
and not of wanton fasshyon. A costly garme^te beyond: or above the state and
degree of the person: is a sign and toke^ of little wit. For a woman that
has suffyciente array: to desire new / and change: is a sing of little
sadness. * Trust him rather for thy friend, that somewhat does for the: than him
that does offer him self: saying. I am yours in all I can and may. For in
words is great plenty of friends. Proverb xvii. c
* A true friend loves at all times, and never fails at need. There is no
comparyson of riches: unto a faithful friend. Ecclesi. s. v
Never repute, ne think him thy friend that does praise / or boste the unto
thy face, or in thy presence. When you give counsel unto a friend: say this
seems best unto me, not thus you must nedely do. For you may sooner get
rebuke, or blame for your counsel if it prove not: than thank for your good
counseyle: though it speed well. If mynstreles, iogulers, or gesters, come unto
thy house: say thou haste no lodging for such gestes / you keep neither Inn
nor alestake. For if you take pleasure in their pastymes: you been full like to
have a another wife shortly after, whose name is called pouerte, or beggry. If
you fortune to come where they ben, and begin somewhat to delecte in their
matters: I advise you dissymule and take upon you that you herd the^ not / ne
set any thing thereby. For if they perceue and se you but laugh: they will take
that for an ernest to cry largess / and to have reward. And so importune will
they be / and so sha^fully crave: that you shall be yrke and weary of them, and
peradventure they will fall to rebukynge / braulynge, and scolding, so that
you shall be feign and glade, to give somewhat (for fere) unto those galowe
clappers, worthy in deed to be hanged up. For I tell you, god is not pleased with
that occupacion: except it be (as sca^t tolerable or alowable) among princes,
lords / and high estates.

Now for your servants, if you have a servant of high proud mind and
stubburne stomach, put him away lest after he do you harm, and so do him that
always does praise your manners in all things. For a flaterer is worse than an
enemy: your enemy can not lightly deceive you, but your seruau^ts or your
neighbors yt do praise you been surely about to deceive you. Ecclesi. vii. c.
^ xxxiii. d
If you have a basshefull and dredefull servant and find him faithful /
than love him and cherysshe him as your own natural child. Make your
buyldynges rather for need than for pleasure. For ye appetyte of buyldyng for
pleasure shall never have end, till pouerte teache wit: so^what to late. Be
loath to sell your heritage, and if you must need sell? Sell not unto great
persons, but rather for less unto ye lower persons. Better is to sell, tha^
to borow by usury. For usury is like a thief ye would warn you before: what
harm he would do unto you. If you bye or bergayn, be not butyfellow with great
persons. And though he be under you, yet strive not with him lest he put his
part unto your better, or master. In all things keep truly and faithfully
your bond and promise, according unto your couenau^te. Due temperau^ce is a
thing of great honesty in a household, let therefore your drink wine / ale /
or bear / be temperate. Strong drink is more pleasau^te / than wholesome.
Ecclesi xxxi. d
The wise man says, that sobre drink is the health both of soul and body.
Ibidem.
And the wise and learned person will be right well content with little drink:
and that shall not trouble ye stomach / but rather cause sweet and wholesome
sleep: and of the contrary done come many inco^modytes as there does follow.
Who so ever among many and diverse strong drynkes with haboundau^ce thereof: is
sobre / may be called an erthly god, or a god upon earth, wrestle not therewith
if you do my counsel. And if by chance you be in company, and begin to feel
ye drink work: arise and depart: a sleep is more mete for you than any
company. Who so by words would excuse dro^kennes: does openly declare his own
disease. The knowledge and judgment of wynes: does nothing become a young
person. If a physicion or surgio^ use to be drunk, let him not have ye cure
of your disease ne let none of the^ take experience, and learn in you / how to
cure or hele a another. For though they be well learned / and have not
experience: it is no wisdom to let the^ prove their connyng upon you. Great
gaye horses, and little preaty dogs: leave you unto lords and ladies. A byg
labouryng horse, and a mastyfe, or a curre dog: ben good to keep your house.
As for hawks, hounds and hu^tyng dogs do spend more than they done get,
they ben mete and according for states: to set idle servants on work, but
far vnaccordyng ben they, for husbands and ware householders. It is no
wisdom to make your own children stewardes or rulers of your household or
goods. Foles and negligent or careless persons, hail many misfortunes. For
that is their common excuse wha^ any thing is wrong they say tha^, that
chance or misfortune was cause thereof. I say not nay: but yt chance or
mysfortune may fall. But who so does follow wisdom, lernyng, and discrecio^
shall seldom accuse mysfortune. For dilligent warenes, and good head, done
seldom company with mysfortune. But yet more seldom shall you se mysfortune and
sloth or neglyge^ce, departed in fondre, for they do^e co^munely company
together. The sluggard says, god will help him, and so long he trusts
thereunto, Prouer. vi.
till he be brought unto beggry For god by ye wise man does send the sluggarde
(for example) unto the Ant or pysmere, Job. v.
to learn to labor. For man (says Job (is borne unto labor, as a byrd to
fly. Keep you (therefore) but few idle persons or men. And watch you well
and take good head unto every person of your house. And ever po^dre, weye, and
co^sydre your expenses, with your gaynes or gettings. First get and bring in,
and tha^ spend. For it is no good husba^dry to borow. And when you wax aged
trust rather unto god than unto your children or fre^des. That you sede before
you, you shall be sure to find. No cofre, cheste, ne tower may be more sure to
keep treasure? than is heaven. Let not (therefore) the poor pass you. What you
give unto the^: you give unto Christ. And of yt you leave behynd you: appoint
unto every person his part. For better were it for you nothing to leave: tha^
yt strife and debate should be made conscience blamysshed and god offended for
your goods. Trust them best to do for your soul: not yt done love, or say
they done love your soul, but that you done perceive, and conjecture, done
love their own soul. Make your tes^^mente every year new, and surely sealed
by wytnes. Lay it where (wha^ need is) (...)ay be found, no man (...) how to
end his life. The (...) sure way, to dye well, is well to live. Which he
grant us, that bought us, our lord god, and most sweet savior Jesus christ.
Amen. Of your charity pray for ye same old wretch of Syon. Richard whytforde.
