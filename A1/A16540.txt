TO THE NOBLE, AND POTENT LORD JAMES MARQVIS OF HAMILTOVN, EARL OF ARANE, AND
CAMBRIDGE, LORD AVEN, AND INNERDAILL, MASTER OF HIS MAJESTY'S HORSES, AND ONE
OF HIS MAJESTY'S PRIVY COUNCIL.
MY most Honorable good Lord,
THE Great GOD who honors these that honor him, has honored your Lo. with
many graces both spiritually and temporally: As for the spiritual, of the love
of the truth, and courage for the same, your L. has already given a certain
proof: we all look for more as occasion shall serve: In whomsoever the
spirit of JESUS truly is, that man will go from grace to grace: He (said our
Master, Ioh. 15.5.
) that abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit.

As for the TEMPORAL, your L. is the first of the Royal blood in this Land
after his MAJESTY: You are the Son of the most wise and worthy Father, who
in his life was a most fast friend both to CHVRCH and Commoun-wealth.

The Lord also has made you the Son of a most Religious and Noble Lady, even
of a Lady LYDIA, whose heart the LORD in great mercy has opened, for to let in
and lodge the KING of GLORY. After my sixteen years absence in France at my
return I arrived at KINNEILL, where her Ladyship received me with such
courtesy, that shall never want my most heartly and humble thanks.

In testimony of my great desire to serve your L. I present you with these two
m^st precious ORIENTAL PEARLS, viz. GRACE and GLORY, which are from him, Luke
1.78.
whom ZACHARY in his Song calls ORIENS ab alto, the day spring from on high:
In this sermon you will see whose Counsel you should chiefly seek: All the
counsel of men with the counsel of Achitophell may easily be turned into
folly; 2. Sam. 15.31.
but here is the counsel that failed never, even the COUNCIL of GOD: Note.
When ever your Lo. is for to deliberate upon any grave and weighty matter,
let this secreet ejaculation first go before, LORD guide me with thy
Counsel, and afterward receive me to Glory.

Note.
The whole Church of Britain most humbly entreats your L. to continue in your
good course and courage for GODS glory: Read often these words of good MORDECAI
to Ester. Think not with thy self that thou shall escape in the Kings house:
Esth. 4.13.14.
For if thou altogether hold thy peace at this time, then shall there
enlargement and deliverance arise to GODS people from another place, but thou
and thy Fathers house shall be destroyed: And who knows whether thou art
come to such honor for such a time as this? Your Lo. sits at the
common-sterne; Help us with your power, and we will help you with our
prayers.

Let it please your L. to take this Sermon in good part, though it be but little.

Note.
At the making of the Tabernacle not only were the great and rich presents
acceptable, as PVRPLE, SCARLET, and BLVE SILK, but also RAMS SKINS, and
GOATS HAIR, which the poorer sort was able only to afford.

For to make an end by humble prayers to GOD for your L. I entreat the most
high, 1 Thessalonians. 3.13.
the God of Majesty and mercy, to make your heart stable and unblameable in
holiness, till he has in you crowned his graces with glory.

Your Lo. Most humble and obedient Servant. Mr. ZACHARY BOYD Preacher of GODS
WORD, at GLASGOW.

GRACE AND GLORY.
THE TEXT.
Psalm. 73.24. Thou shall guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
to glory.
IN my former Sermon ye heard of GOD his favors bestowed upon his servant:
both in time present, and in times by past: As for the present he said, I am
continually with thee: As for the time past, he said Thou have holden me with
thy right hand: In this verse his soul is riding at the anchor of hope: He is
vpholden with the expectation of good things for times to come, Thou shall
guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory: That is, Thou
shall direct the whole course of my life by thy wisdom and power, and after
that thou have brought me through many tribulations and afflictions thou shall
first gloriously deliver me in this life, and after this life thou shall
glorify me besides thy self in the Heavens for ever: Here is both Grace and
Glory.

THE DIVISION OF THE TEXT
IN the words we shall particularly consider these four things 1. Who is this
guider: The guider is GOD; Thou shall guide. 2. Who is guided, it is David:
Thou shall guide me. 3. wherewith, with thy counsel, Thou shall guide me with
thy counsel. 4. Whereunto, even unto glory; And afterward thou shall receive
me to Glory: Of these in order.

THE FIRST PART. THE GVIDER.
HE who is said to guide, here is the Lord the great Governor of the world:
He is he, who gives eyes to the blind and feet to the lame: He is he whose
Isa. 32.19.
eyes are open upon all the ways of the Sons of men: As the Exodus 14.19.
Pillar of fire was Isreal's guide by night, and by day became a Pillar of a
Clowd for their guard behind them, between them and the Egyptians, even so the
LORD GOD is our guide and our guard; Our guide like a Pillar of fire in
darkness showing us the way, our guard, like a Pillar of a clowd behind us
hiding us from the cruel Pharao's, the enemies of our salvation.

All that is to be required in a guide is in him in all perfection: In a good
guide these four things are chiefly required: 1. that he see: 2. that he be
wise. 3. that he be willing. 4. that he be able to direct and go before in
the way.

1. As for the first, There is none that sees so clearly as the Lord: Note.
John saw his eyes both bright and burning Revel. 1.14.
as a flame of fire: He must see most clearly, who by his word Psalm. 19.8.
inlighteneth man's eyes: This was the Psalmists reasoning Psalm. 94.9.
He that formed the eye shall he not see? All other guides are but like these
Pharisees whom Christ called Mat. 23.16.
Blind guides.

2. A guide had need to be a wise man: Note.
There be many difficulties between us and heaven: As the people of God went
through Exodus 15.22.
a Wilderness, before they could enter into Canaan, so must we pass Act.
14.22,
through many tribulations before that we can come to glory: There is no
wisdom but the wisdom of GOD, which can lead us into that land of
Righteousness.

3. As a guide must be wise, so must he be willing: Note.
The LORD is most willing to guide all wandering sinners: His delight is to do
good to the Children of men: He will most lovingly say to a wearied sinner,
that which DAVID says in the Psalm, Psalm, 32.8.
I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way that thou shall go, and I
will guide thee with mine eye.

4. As GOD is wise and willing, so is he able to make way unto his own;
whether it be through fire or water, nothing can withstand his power: In the
fiery furnace he made a way unto the Dan. 3.25.
three Children: The Exodus 14.21.
red sea he divided for to make a passage for his own Israel: He who made
the 2. King. 2.14.
mantle of Elijah to divide the Jordan, that Elisha might pass through: And
He who can of a Mark. 10.25.
Camel make a thread for to pass through a needles eye, can easily guide his
own through all dangers and difficulties whatsoever, were it through the Psalm.
23.4.
Valley of the shadow of death.

The doctrine I gather here is, The doctrine.
that the LORD is he, who is the surest guide in the world: Flesh Psalm. 73.26.
and heart may fail man, but the LORD never fails. There be no man so wise
in guiding, but his wisdom at last, like 2. Sam. 17.14.
Ahitophels Counsel may be turned into folly, but 1. Cor. 1.25.
the folly of GOD is wiser than all the wisdom of men.

The use.
The use: Let this ever be a part of our prayer, that the LORD would be our
guide. Note.
He who guided the two kine to 2. Sam 6.9.
Bethshemesh, though they lowed for the love of their Calves, can easily find
to us an outgate in the greatest throng of all our temptations, and that unto
the praise of the glory of his grace.

THE SECOND PART. WHO IS GVIDED.
NOW let us see whom the LORD is said to guide here: Thou shall guide me,
says the Seer. Note.
Consider and weigh well I pray you, how this great man of GOD, a Prophet, a
Seer, trusts not into his own wits, but commits himself altogether to
GODS guiding.

The doctrine.
The doctrine I observe is, that weak is the wit of man: All men have need to
be guided by the LORD: If any have need of a guide, fools have need: we
are all but fools by nature: David in this Psalm acknowledges his folly, So
foolish, (says he,) was I and ignorant, I was a beast before thee. v. 22.


Note.
While a man sins, he is like a man run out of his wits, while he
repents, he is like one returned to his wits again: A man once out of his
right wit can never know the way to return unto it, until the LORD guide him
home again.

The use: The use.
Let none of us all rely upon our own wisdom: Ier. 9.23.
Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor the strong man in his
strength. When David both a King and a Prophet, declares that he has need to
be guided, who is he who by his own wisdom can walk 2. Pet. 2.21.
in the way of Righteousness? All men are sinners: By sin a man is misled
from the right way. Note.
Sin makes a man both like a PLANET, and a COMET, like a COMET in substance
filthy, like a PLANET, in course ever wandering to and fro: All the wicked are
but corruptible COMETS, and unconstant wandering PLANETS, which wander so far
from the LORD that the spirit of GOD has given out this verdict against them,
Psalm. 119.155
SALVATION is far from the wicked: All the wicked are but wandering creatures,
who can never learn that last point of GODS counsel, which is Micah 6.8.
to walk with their GOD.

We all naturally are blind like Moules, we can not see ante pedes posita,
the things which are directly before us. Note.
Our case spiritually is worse than that of the Moule; for though it see not,
it is most quick in hearing: if it be blind it is not deaf; the least
stirring of ones foot will give it warning, and it will haste it self to its
own strength: Note.
But we all naturally are deprived of all our spiritual senses: The eyes and
ears of our Souls, are like the eyes and ears of idols, which Psalm. 135.16.
have eyes and see not, and ears and hear not: We are more deaf than the
Psalm. 58.4.
Adder, which is wilfully, deaf against the voice of the Charmer: Our ears
are made heavy: Our eyes are Pharisaicall, full of beams: To every one of us
may be said, as CHRIST said to the Pharisee, Thou Math. 7.5.
blind fool, cast out first that beam that is in thine eye: The sense of
savoring is gone. While the word is preached, there is a 2. Cor. 2.16.
savor of life unto life: Where CHRIST the Cant. 2.^.
Rose of Sharon, and the Lilly of the Valleys is preached, there may be felt
Ephesians. 5.2.
a sweet smelling savor, like that costly John. 12.3.
Spikenard of Mary, which filled the house with a sweet odor; but we are
naturally like these, who are ever amongst odoure and dung, not able to find
any savor at all: Our touching and our tasting is lost: Thomas after he had
John. 20.29.
touched, by grace he believed: By grace also the Math. 9.21.
bloody woman in touching was healed: But all men by nature are like these
Luke. 8.45.
multitudes, which in the throng touched CHRIST, but were not touched with that
virtue that came out of him. As for our tasting, none by nature can Heb. 5.14.
taste and see how good is the LORD: It is only by grace that we have our
senses exercised.

Note.
Thus as ye see the Soul of man is naturally deprived of its five senses,
which are the five guides under GOD appointed, for to lead the Soul from grace
to glory. Note.
And which is the mischief of all, not only are we naturally deprived of all
our five spiritual senses, but also of that Commoun sense, wherewith we
should judge of the other senses.

Note.
The blind man by no sense, but by commoun sense can know that he is blind, and
so of the deaf man: But if he while he is deaf and blind, he think that
he hears and sees, he has lost his commoun sense: This is the folly of man,
while he wants the spiritual senses, he knows not his wants: Note.
This was the disease of Laodicea, she said that she Revel. 3.17.
had need of nothing; but GOD said, that she had lost her commoun sense,
because she knew not that she was wretched and miserable, and poor and
blind, and naked: To all such the very wisdom of GOD is folly, till GOD begin
to guide them. Understands thou what thou reads? said Philip to that Enuch,
reading the Prophecy of Isaiah: Act. 8.31.
How can I (said he) except that some guide me? So may (...) say to you all,
Understand ye that is your duty both to GOD ^^d man in this world? Know ye
(...) way that leads to life eternal? ^^w can we, (may ye well say,) ^^cept
that GOD guide us?

Let us therefore never rely upon ^^y wisdom of flesh and blood, ^^r to be
guided thereby: The wis^^me of flesh is enimitie against GOD:

The wisdom of GOD befooles it: Note.
^ee who is wisest in his own eyes, (...) the greatest fool in GOD his ^^ght.
It is not the wisdom of ^^is world, whereby the Church on ^^rth is guided, or
has her stan^^ng: It is by him, who confundit ^^pientiam sapientum, has 1.
Cor. 1.20.
made ^^^lish the wisdom of this world.

His custom is to make his wis^ome appear in folly, Note.
and to make ^is 2. Cor. 12.9.
strength to be made perfect in (...) weakness, as he manifested himself ^y
fire in the midst of water, while it ^t was agreed upon by Elijah and Ba^ls
Priests, that 1. King 18.24.
the GOD that should ^nswere by fire should be GOD.

THE THIRD PART. WHEREWITH GOD GVIDETH his Servant.
Ambros. Consilium bonis datur, correctio errantibus.
NOW in this third part of our Text, we have to considder wherewith the man of
GODS heart desires to be guided: It is with GODS counsel: Thou shall guide
me with thy counsel.

The counsel of God is by Zachary called, Zach. 6.13.
The counsel of peace; whereby man is counseled to seek Gods peace and man's
peace, according to that of the Psalm, Psalm. 34.14.
seek peace and follow after it. Note:
GODS Counsel Book is the Bible: our preachings tend all to this, that we
make you understand the counsel of God that ye may be guided thereby: That
was a great word that St. Paul said to the Elders at Miletum Act. 20.27.
I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God: our life is a
warrefare, and therefore we have great need of Counsel; for 2. King 18.20.
Counsel and strength are for the war.

Before I come to the doctrines: Facile pecunia consumitur, consilia exhauri
nesciunt.
(...) us considder how God gives his ^^unsell unto his beloved ones: The ^^rd
counsels man after two ^aners especialy, 1. outwardly, 2. in^^rdly:
outwardly the Lord lets men know his mind after two manners, 1. By the
works of nature, which while a man of a sanctified ^ye sees them so contrived
and guided, ^s is wonderful, he receives counsel ^hereby, to fear and
reverence so ^reat a majesty: Romans 1.20.
The invisible things ^f God, says Paul, are clearly seen, ^eing understood
by the things that ^re made: Behold in the things that are made, we have a
counsel, make^ng us to understand the invisible things of our God, even his
power and Godhead, 2. By the preaching of the word, the Lord guides us as by
his counsel.

Again inwardly the Lord guides man, by the motions of his Spirit, which is
effectual in all the Children of election: Note.
This Spirit has diverse and very secret stirrings in the heart of man: whiles
Revel. 3.20.
he knockes at the door of our hearts, counselling us to open and let him
in: whiles he puteth his finger in Cant. 5.4.
by the whole of the door, letting drops of myrrh fall down upon the handle
of the bar, which is a sweet assureing counsel, for to make us arise out of
the bed of our security, for to seek him and follow after him: sometimes he
counsels us to take in good part all the chastisements of our God, from this
he is called John. 16.7.
the comforter: sometimes he teaches us to stand in awe to offend the LORD
our GOD, from this is he called Isa. 11.2.
the Spirit of the fear of the Lord: Again while he counseleth us to be
holy, he is called Romans 1.4.
the Spirit of holiness: while he counsels us to love truth, and fly from
lies, he is called 1. John. 4.6.
the spirit of truth: while he quickens our dead Souls, he is called
Revel. 11.11.
the spirit of life: while he inlighteneth the mind with knowledge of things to
come, he is called Revel. 19.10.
the Spirit of prophecy: In a word because he makes man of quick
understanding? he is called Isa. 11.3.
the Spirit of wisdom and of counsel: Because when no coun^^l is to be had,
then he gives coun^^l, he is said to be Isa. 28.29.
wounderfull in ^ounsell and excellent in working.

The Spirit of GOD guides men also by dreams and visions: Note.
So by a dream he counseled Pilats Wife to counsel her husband not to
trouble jesus: Mat. 27.19.
when he was set down on the ^^dgement seat, his wife sent unto him, ^^ying,
Have nothing to do with that ^^st man: for I have suffered many things this
day in a dream because of him: All this was from the counsel of God: I Psalm.
16.7.
bless the Lord, (said David) who has given me counsel: my reins ^lso
instruct me in the night season:

Note.
While others are sleeping the godly man has a doctor in his reins guiding
him with counsel, whereby he may be made 2 Timothy 3.15.
wise to Salvation.

The doctrine.
The chief doctrine I observe here, is, that the counsel of God is that
whereby a man is guided on earth:

Counsel is mine and sound wisdom, I am understanding says the LORD, Prove.
8.14.


The use, He that desires to be well guided, The use.
let him entreat the Lord earnestly to guide him with his counsel, outwardly
by his word, and inwardly by his Spirit: let us in all our affairs ever seek
counsel from the Lord: If we seek it, he will not refuse it: Ier. 33.2.
Call upon me, (said he,) and I will answer thee and show the great and
mighty things which thou know not: Note.
If we would be guided by Gods counsel, let us first seek earnestly the
Isa. 11.3.
Spirit of counsel, and thereafter let us carefully meditate night and day of
that which is in the Bible, the BOOK of COUNSEL: Note.
That which the Exodus 13.21.
PILLAR of FIRE was in the night to Israel, that is the counsel of GOD to all
Israelites indeed, yea and more; for that PILLAR of FIRE could not make the
blind to see; But the Counsel of GOD Meira Henaijm Psalm. 19.8.
inlighteneth the eyes making wise the simple: Note.
A wise man may give a good counsel to a fool, but only GOD by his counsel
can make a fool wise: seeing it is so, let us be earnest in all our
difficulties to come and seek the Lords counsel in his Church, in his
counsell-house: Note.
David could never understand what GOD meaned i^ ^he prosperity of the wicked,
till (...) ^ame to his Psalm. 73.17.
Sanctuary, his Coun^^^ house, where he heard the words o^ his Counsel made
plain.

Woe to him that will not be counseled by God his word: Note.
This woe is very old: Isa. 29.15.
woe unto them, (^^id Isaiah,) that seek deep for ^^ide their counsels from
the Lord: ^eare him yet again, Isa. 30.1:
woe to the ^^bellious Children that take counsel, ^ut not of me: Of all
these that will ^ot be guided by GODS counsel, but walk in the counsels of
their own heart, is said, that they Ier: 7:24:
go backward but not foreward: Note.
Who ^ver he be that will not be guided ^y GODS counsel, the LORD shall ^iue
him over to a foolish counselor, ^ven to himself: Of this we have ^he
practice in the Psalm Psalm: 81:11:
My people would not harken to my voice, and Israel would have none of me,
that ^s, they would not take my counsel: But what did ensue? Psalm: 81:12:
So I gave them up unto their own hearts lust, and they walked in their own
counsels: That is they became their own counselors: Woe to that man, who
depends upon his own counsel.

It is written, that Israel Psalm: 106:13:
would not wait for his counsel; But wha^ followed upon that? v: 15:
He sent leanness into their soul: Because they Psalm: 106:43:
provoked him by their counsel, he brought them low for their iniquity,
till they Prover: 1:31:
were filled with their own devices.

Note.
By this the truth of the wise man's saying is clear, The Prever: 12:5:
counsels of the wicked are deceit, whereby they themselves are deceived, even
then when they think most to deceive both GOD and man. It was wisely said by
Solomon, There Prover: 19:21:
are many devices in a man's heart, nevertheless, the counsel of the LORD*
that shall stand: Yea says the LORD, My Isa: 46:10:
counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure. This is the counsel
that will never fail. It is reported of a certain godly man, that when ever
he came home to his house malecontent, he cried for GODS BOOK of COUNCIL,
say^^^, Note.
Give me the BIBLE, for (...) ^s the Book that never failed (...)

(...) second use: The 2 use.
Let this be a reproo^e for all these that are carele^^ of the counsel of
GOD: Many (...) not hear it at all, as many Pa^^^ to whom the BIBLE, GODS
^^^NSELL BOOK is closed, and ^^^ed: Note.
Others again are like ^^^hoboam, 1: King: 12:9:
who after that he had ^^^rd the wise men's counsel, would (...) be guided by
it, but would also ^^are what the young fools could say.

Many will come to the Church (...) to hear GODS Counsel, Note.
but after that they have heard what GODS ^^sedome has spoken, they will also
^^ue ear, and hear what the world can ^ye, what flesh can persuade, what
their passions can speak, what their rot^en lusts would be at: As foolish
Reheboam 1: King 12:13:
forsook the old Men's counsel, and followed the folies of young men; So many
which be old, and should have been wise long since, forsake the counsel of
GOD, the Dan: 7:9:
Ancient of days, and follow the counsel of youth, even the folly of youth,
not with standing all the LORDS counsels: Of this the LORDS complains in
Jeremy, Ier: 32:33:
They have, (said he,) turned unto me the back, and not the face; though I
taught them, rising up early, yet they have not hearkened for to receive
instruction. The most part of men are guided by the counsel, not of GOD, but
of flesh and blood, whose advice is, that they break Hos: 4:2:
out by swearing and lying, and committing adultery, till blood touch blood:
Flesh and blood are but dead things: Note.
These who seek counsel from them, are like these, who in their trouble had
recourse unto Wizards that peep and mutter: Now what says the LORD to such?
Should Isa: 8:19:
not a people seek unto their GOD? for the living to the dead? No not; To the
law and to the Testimony: This is the LORDS COVNSELL-BOOKE: If any contemn
this counsel, Isa: 8:20:
it is because there is no murning in them; Note.
That is, they are without all knowledge in the black night of ignorance,
where they have never seen the meanest light of grace, no no^ so much as the
least glimmering of ^ight, which appears at the dawin^ or break of day.

A man that is not godly has many Counselors, and they all tend unto his
ruin: Note:
The LORD our GOD taking a special care of us, discharged us their counsel:
Deuteronomy: 18:10:
Let none, (says he,) be found amongst you that is a regarder of times, or a
^arker of the flying of fowls, or a ^harmer, v: 11:
or that counsels with spirits, or that asks counsel at the dead. Note:
See whereunto the folly of man carries him, that from GOD his greatest friend
he runs away for to seek counsel from ill spirits his greatest enemies:
And again, what a brutish folly is this, that a living man should run to
seek counsel from the dead, who have no counsel for themselves? The wise man
said truly, There Eccles: 9:10:
is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave: Note.
That must be a slight COVNSELL-HOVSE, wherein is neither device, knowledge, or
wisdom. Woe unto them that have an ear for GOD, and an other for Satan, the
World, and their own corruptions: Woe unto them that seek counsel, but not
from the LORD, the LORD at last shall curse all suc^ counsels, and with the
counsel of Ahitophell he 2 Samuel: 15:31:
shall turn them into foolishness.

As for you Brethren and Sisters, when ever ye find your selves in
perplexity or anguish, be not like these of whom it is said in the Psalm
Psalm: 106:13
They waited not for his counsel: This is that wherewith good Moses branded
Israel in his heavenly song, Deuteronomy: 32:28:
They were a nation void of counsel: Note.
Many are void of GODS Counsel, who like Babylon Isa: 47:14:
are wearied in the multitude of their own counsels: Note.
Well are the counsels of the wicked called a multitude of counsels, for such
men have no certain resolution, but are whiles Isa: 28:13:
on this line and whiles on that line, now on this precept and then on that
precept, here a little and there a little, like that wandering Leuite, who did
go to sojourne Iud: 17:9:
where he might find a place, ^^ing sure of no place: Such in their ^^ings
Isa: 28:13:
go, and fall backward, they (...) broken, and snared, and taken: ^f Jeremy
in a muddie mind, Note:
while (...) flesh did fret, said unto GOD (...) wise counselor Ier: 20:7:
O LORD thou (...) deceived me, and I have been ^^^eiued, O how shall the
wicked ^^e day curse their Counselors, the ^^ltitudes of their counselors,
Satan, ^^e flesh, and the world, which are ^^t a company of deceivers, and a
^^ry knot of knaves.

Let us here again observe, The doctrine:
that ^^eat is the prerogative of GODS ^hildren: Note:
They are all GODS: ^ORDS of Counsel: He is indeed (...) LORD of counsel,
that can take ^ODS counsel: All the children (...) GOD have this honor to be
of ^ODS Counsel: for whom GOD ^^ides with his counsel, these he ^uts upon
his counsel: Amos: 3:7:
surely, (says ^mos,) the LORD GOD will do ^^thing, but he reuealeth his
secrets unto his servants the Prophets:: Note.
He that is the Iam: 2:23:
friend of GOD, as Abraham was, shall be one of h^^ PRIVY COUNCIL: wha^ ever
occur, that is needful to b^ known shall not be concealed from him. Gen:
18:17.
shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do? (said the LORD) 1: Cor: 2:16,
we have the mind of CHRIST (said the Apostle:) Note.
Behold how the LORD guides his own, so wit^ his Counsel, that in a manner he
puts his mind into them.

The 1 use.
The use: Let the children of GOD comfort themselves with this, that what ever
calamities shall befall unto them, the LORD shall guide them so with his
counsel, that in all their temptations they shall come to a^ happy 1: Cor:
10:13
outgate: By his counsel he shall let him know how they shall come out of
tribulation: Note.
According to this, the Prophet Micah said to the Church in her affliction
Micah: 4:9:
now why do thou cry out aloude? Is there no King in thee? Is thy counselor
perished? for pangs have taken thee as a Woman in travel.

The 2 Use.
Another use of this doctrine is this, seeing the LORD guides the Faithful with
his counsel, let us beware to give ^^^nsell or take counsel against such
(...) Counselor: Note.
Cursed are these and (...) their followers, of whom the P^^lmist speaks Psalm:
83.3.
they have consulted t^^ether with one consent: thy are con^^^erate against
thee: Cursed also are ^^ese that consult against the well of ^^s Children, like
these of whom it (...) said, They Psalm: 83:3:
have taken crafty coun^^l against thy people, and consulted ^^ainst thy
hidden ones: * The ^gyptians were never so foolish, as ^hen they said, Exodus:
1:10:
Come on, let us ^^ale wisely.

The general use of all is, that we ^^e at all times earnest in prayer, that
^^e LORD in all our business would ^^ide us by his Counsel, and also ^^epe us
from all ill Counsel: Note.
The ^^ine of King Ahazia is imputed vn^^ this, that he followed ill coun^^ll:
1: Chron. 22.30.
He, (says the scripture,) ^alked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his
mother was his coun^^ller to do wickedly. Bildad speak^^g of the wicked,
(says,) his Job. 18, 7,
own ^^unsell shall cast him down: Happy then, and thrice happy is he, whom
GOD in this life guides with hi^ Counsel, for afterward he shall receive him
to glory: This last we se^ in the last part of our Text.

While my pen was here, my dear Brother Mr. Robert Scot sleept, Anno DOM.
1629. the 27. of Ianuar, on a Weddinsday, a little before nine hours in the
morning.

THE FOVRTH PART.
Afterward thou shall receive me to glory,
THis is the last part of our Text, and this is the last of all GODS benefits:
Note.
This is GODS goodness which crowns all his other mercies, when he receives
us to glory: when he has done all the good that can be done unto us in this
life, by being with us continualy, and by holding us by our right hand and
guiding us by his counsel, all ends with this that he receives vt to glory:
(...) we receive grace, and after-ward (...) are received to glory. These
^^^ds of my Text are sweet honey ^^^des, And afterward thou shall ^iue me to
glory.

^eere we have to consider two ^^^gs, 1. the time of receiving a man glory, it
is, afterward, 2. what it ^o be received to glory.

The time of receiving man to Glory.
THE time wherein GOD is said to receive a Soul to glory, (...) here set
down in the word ^FTERWARD: that is, after that ^OD has led me with his
coun^^, he shall receive me to glory.

The doctrine which breefly I (...) serve here, is, The doctrine:
that it is the coun^^l of GOD, which guides to glory: ^^e way is grace,
grace, from grace (...) grace: The end of all is glory:

This is, Note.
the Sea whereinto all good ^^^ngs end like rivers running to their ^^ther the
Ocean, from whence they came.

The use.
The use. He who would be received to glory, let him be ledd^ with GOD his
counsel: If thou refuse to be guided by his counsel^ he shall refuse to
receive thee to glory Prove, 1, 24.
Because I have called, (said wisdom,) and ye refused, I have stretc^ed out
my hand and no man regarde^ etc. v, 26.
And therefore I also will laug^ at your calamity, I will mock wh^ your fear
comes.

The doctrine.
The other doctrine I observe heer^ is, a doctrine of patience, for the^ that
are in affliction: After man^ tribulations the LORD at last sha^ receive them
to glory.

The use.
The use. What ever our affliction be, let us not be discouraged: The^ are but
for a time, yea the time i^ short, that done, afterward our GOD shall receive
us to glory: The Lord shall free us then from all our woes. Though we mourn
now, yet afterward we shall laugh, and GOD shall wipe all tears from our eyes.

I entreat you Brethren to make vs^ of this use: how painful soeve^ your
troubles be, comfort you^ selves with these most comfortable (...): Afterward
thou shall receive (...) ^o glory: Note.
This AFTERWARD (...) faithful man's high Tower and stro^^est Hold: He stands
upon the ho^^ of AFTERWARD, like a bes^^^^ man. The Faithful Man is b^^^ged
with many temptations, but (...) CASTLE of AFTERWARD (...) never be battered
down.

^^^^gh Job: 19.26.
AFTER my skin worms (...) ^oy this body, (said Job,) yet in (...) flesh
shall I see GOD: Note.
That is a^ ^^ppy destruction whereby we are b^^^ght unto the sight of GOD: O
le^ ^y body so be destroyed, that m^ Soul may see GOD, till AFTERWARD both
in flesh and spirit I ^^^ll see him, and none other for me: (...) 1 Cor: 15:19:
in this life only we have hope (...) CHRIST, we are of all men most
^^^erable: All the comforts of the ^^^dly are chiefly in AFTERWARD.

This is the Martyrs song in the (...): Note.
AFTERWARD thou shall receive ^^e to Glory.

Learn all the way to the strong ^^ld, where ye may be hid when your
enemies shall assault you.

Note.
Look ever unto AFTERWARD. If thine enemy go about to disgrace thee and
trouble thee, it may be thou smart for a space, but it shall not be so for
ever, for AFTERWARD thou shall be received to glory: If thine enemies
reproach thee, if the wicked despise thee, if thy flesh fail thee, and if thy
friends forsake thee, GOD his help is in AFTERWARD: Here is thy comfort O
man, AFTERWARD the LORD shall receive thee to glory: This is a salve for all
sores. Note.
GOD his AFTERWARD is like the last wine in that Banquet of Cana: At other
Bankets in John: 2:10.
the beginning men did set forth good wine, and when men had well drunk the
worst came last; but in CHRIST Banquet the last was best: It is so of the life
of all true Christians: Many Psalm. 33:19:
are the troubles of the Righteous, it is said in a Psalm, but AFTERWARD it
is said The Psalm. 37.37.
end of that man is peace.

This is the great difference betwixt the Saints of GOD and the wicked, They
will live together, and lie together in Luke 17.34.

But tarry a little, till the God^^ man come to his AFTERWARD, and (...) wicked
man to his, and then ^^ke choice on whose side ye will (...): I Psalm. 37.35
have seen, (said David,) (...) wicked in great power, and sprea^^^g himself
like a green bay tree: (...) hold not an ear, but an eye wit^^^se: I have
seen him, says he, a brave ^^^n; but what was the end and conclu^^^n of so
fair a preface? v. 36.
Yet he ^^ssed away, and lo he was not:

O David what say thou? Note.
Lo ^^e was not: It may be thou sought ^^m not: Yea I sought him, (said
Da^id,) but I could not find him: Be^old now his AFTERWARD: Take up ^ow our
green bay tree: All is wi^hered like that Iona. 4.7.
Gourd of Jonah: ^ut Psalm. 37.37.
mark the perfect man, and be^old the upright, for the end of that man is
peace: Though for a space the Godly Psalm. 98.13
lie amongst the Port AFTERWARD they become as the wing^ of a Dove covered
with silver, an^ her feathers with yellow gold.

Note.
The wicked and the Godly i^ this world, are like Corn and Chaff^ in one
Barn; but AFTERWARD the fan shall make such a separation, that they shall
never meet again.

Note.
Between Dives and Lazarus on earth, there may be but a door or a C^urt; O
but tarry till AFTERVV RD, and behold a Luke 16.16.
great GVLF fixed, wherethrough was no passage at all, ne there from above nor
from below: T^^ves in Hell lifting up his eyes, did Luke 16.23
see Abraham a far of: These may well be said to be far of, who shall
never meet again: So soon as the Godly and wicked are come to their
AFTERWARD, they go contrary ways: These Math. 25.46.
shall go away to everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life eternal.

If we could look to this AFTERWARD in our distresses, it should support us
wonderfully. A man that knows where to get meat, will suffer ^^nger more
patiently than he that ^^owes not where to dine. Note.
Let these who look not for better AFTERWARD, fr^^ in their present trouble:
Present troubles are sore, yea unsupportable (...) these that look for future
woes.

The earnest of damnation is feare^^ll. Note.
All the troubles of the wicked ^^ere, are the very earnest of dam^^tion: They
cry to the wicked man, Assure thy self, the whole sum ^^all be paid to
thee at the term.

But as for thee, Note.
who can say to GOD, as is said in the verse before, (...) am continually with
thee, the LORD shall hold thee by thy right hand, ^ee shall guide thee with his
coun^ell, and in the despite of all the ^owers of hell, AFTERWARD He shall
receive thee to glory.

2. The receiving of man to Glory.
WE have heard of the time of his receiving; Now let us see whereunto he
shall be received, Thou, (said he,) shall receive me to glory.

Note.
In the Hebrew it is Cauod Tikacheni, that is, as Arias has turned it, gloriam
accipies me, thou shall receive me glory: The words though in that exposition
they seem to be difficile are of great weight: The words, Thou shall receive
me gl^ry, import such a glory, that he who shall be glorified thereby shall
be in a manner, glory it self when in the Gospel, as in a glass we behold
the glory of the LORD, we are 2. Cor. 3.18:
changed into this same image from glory to glory; how much more shall we all
be changed into glory, when in the Heavens with open face we shall behold our
GOD, not as in a glass, or by representation, but face to face, and that for
evermore?

Note.
The word glory in the original, is Cauod, that is weighty: It is so called
from its weightinesse: To this the Apostle seems to look, when he says,
that 2: Cor: 4.17.
our light affliction, which is but for a moment, ^^^keth for us a far more
exceed^^^ and eternal weight of glory:

Such an everlasting PONDVS w^ight, Note.
can no more be weighed in the heart of man; then a mil^^^ne or a mountain can
be weighed (...) the little scale of a gold Balance, (...) herein I pray you
can an exceed^^g weight be contained? if it could ^^e contained, it should not
be ^^ceeding: As it is infinite, exceeding ^^l dimensions, so it is not
subject to ^^y circumstance of time, for it is ^^ernall. Note.
By this eternity, the ^^ory of God is distinguished from the ^^ory of the
world, which is but ^n evanishing show: 1, Pet. 1:14.
All flesh is ^rasse: (says the Apostle,) and all ^he glory of man as the
flower of the ^rasse: The grass withreth, so does ^ll flesh; and the flower
of the grass ^asseth away, So does all the glory ^f man: Note.
Nay the glory of man ^s not so great as the glory of grass: This the Lord
declared when preach^ng upon the lillies, he said, that Mat: 6, 29:
Solomon in all his glory was not one one of these: what are men and all their
glory? and that of all states i^ Psalm: 62:9:
surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie, to lay
them upon a balance they are altogether lighter than vanity: Noted.
All the glory of flesh can no more be called weighty, then a painted man can
be called a man: It is indeed somewhat like unto it; but it has nothing of
its definition: It is but a painted glory, like a feast in print, wherein is no
meat but resemblances, figures, colors; and representations: Now let us
proceed.

Afterward thou shall reeeiue me to glory.
Note.
GLory as ye see here, is the resting place of the Saints: There is no right
rest for a Soul, till it be received there; the place is called GLORY, because
GOD there manifests his glory: There the eyes of thy Soul O man, shall see
the things which 1: Cor: 2:9:
eye never saw: There thine ears shall hear that which ear never heard:
There be such things that co^^d never enter into the heart of man.

This place is called our Mat: 25:21
Masters joy, a Luk: 23:43:
Paradise, or Garden of Pleasures: Everlasting Luk: 16:9:
Tabernacles, a building 2: Cor, 5:1:
of GOD, and a house no^ made with hands, it is also called GODS Heb: 3:11.
rest, signified by that Canaan, which for that which it signifi^d was called
his rest.

In the names of Heaven many comforts be infolded: The doctrine.
If while we are ^eere we are crossed and tossed with much grief and sorrow,
our Comfort is this, Math. 25:21:
that Heaven is our o Masters joy: If we loath and abhor the filthy stink
of sin, Heaven is a Luk: 23:43.
^aradise, a Garden of Heavenly ^owers, where is the Cant: 2:1:
Rose of Sa^^n, and the Lilly of the Valleys: ^here is the sweet savor of
GOD, (...) whom is the savor 2: Cor: 2:16:
of life vn^^ life, of the life of grace unto ^he life of glory: If we be
here (...) lodged, above are prepared for ^s these everlasting Luk: 16:9:
tabernacles, ^ven a building 2: Cor: 5:1:
of GOD, not made ^ith hands: If we be wearied Pilgrims here, there is an
everlasting rest: If we be naked here, there we shall be arrayed Revel:
7:13:
in white robes: If we be hungry here, there is the Revel: 22:2:
Tree of life: If we be thirsty here, there is that pure, clean, clear,
and Cristall River, whereof the streams make glad the City of GOD. 1 Psa:
46.4.


Here let us observe diverse uses of this Doctrine, and that both for Comfort
and for Counsel; for comfort we have both for the living and dying,

The 1 Use.
This should be a chief comfort for the dying: Seeing there be such
commodities in that other world, we should desire gladely to flit and remove
from this sinful world: 2. Cor. 5:2:
In this we groan earnestly, desiring to be clothed upon with our house, which
is from Heaven. While we are at home in this body, we are absent from the
Lord: Here is meekle toil and turmoile, meekle shame and sorrow, and which is
the mischief of all, here is meekle sin and iniquity, but there, is glory,
joy, rest, peace, and Psalm. 16.11.
pleasures for evermore. While I think on these things, Psalm. 42.2.
my Soul thirsts for GOD, even for the living GOD: O! When shall I come, and
appear before GOD? Note.
Let all Godly men comfort themselves with this against the fear of death,
Note.
after that Job. 14.14.
the time of their changing is come, the LORD shall receive them to glory. Note.
The voice came from Heaven with a command to write, Write, (said the Spirit to
John. What shall I write? said John Write, Revel. 14.13.
Blessed are the Dead which die in the LORD, from henceforth, y^^, says the
Spirit, that they may rest from their labors: Such go not away without good
company, ^or as the Spirit said to John, their ^orkes do follow them: The
hearing (...) this should make all sanctified ^oules, say with the Apostle,
Philip. 1.23.
I de^^e to be dissolved, and to be with CHRIST, which is meekle better ^or
me.

O what if there were a Coun^^ey on earth, Note.
which were such a ^^nd of the Living, where death were discharged to come,
where sin, sickness, sorrow, hunger, cold, and nakedness might get no
entry? O what multitudes would swarm thither: Two 2. King. 5.17.
Mules burden of that earth should be more precious than burdens of gold: All
that a man has, gladly will he give Job. 2.4.
it for his life: How meekle then should we think our selves obliged to GOD,
who has prepared a Country of glory for us, a Country where the Tree Revel.
22.2.
of life grows, where the indwellers shall live in everlasting happiness,
which for greatness can not enter into the heart of man: Oh that we had faith
to believe this, so should we not delight so much to wallow in the muddie
mires of sinful mortality. Oh that we had faith to believe, so should we
cry, Psalm. 55.7.
O who will give us the wings of a Dove, that we might fly up to that Palace
of Psalm. 16, 11.
Pleasures for evermore: The tongues of Angels can not express the least glory
that is there: St. Augustine has a notable speech concerning this.

Facilius possumus dicere quid non (...) vita aeterna, quam quid ibi sit,
August.
Non est ibi mors, luctus, lassitudo, fa^^s, sitis, aestus, etc. Quid autem ib^
^^sit vis nosse? Haec nec oculus vidi^^ nec auris audivit, nec in cor hom^nis
ascendit: Si in cor hominis no^^ ascendit, cor hominis illuc ascendat.

that is: It is more easy to tell what (...) not, then what is, in eternal
life: (...) here is neither death, nor sorrow, nor weariness, nor hunger, nor
thirst, nor heat, etc. But will thou know what is there? That which eye has
not seen, nor ear heard, neither ^^th it ascended into the heart of man: If
it can not ascend into the heart of man, let the heart of man ^scend unto it.

Again here is a comfort for (...) living, that mourn for the dead. The 2
use.


It is natural to mourn for the absence of these whom we have lo^^d here.
Note.
When Elisha saw Eli^^^, caught up and carried away through the clouds, he
cried, 2, King 2, 12,
My ^ather my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof: H^
lamented sore his absence, but in the was his great comfort; that he i^ him
received to glory: Ye who (...) fatherless or motherlesse, Note.
Loo^ not to the Church-yeard where yo^ fathers and mothers are rotting (...)
rotten; comfort your selves in the GOD has received them to glo^^ Ye once
busbands and now w^dowes, remember your wives wh^^ once were your glory, (The
1, Cor. 11, 7,
wom^^ is the glory of the man,) here (...) your comfort, the LORD has
r^ceived them to glory: Likewise y^^ women, who now heavily regra^^ these,
whose glory once ye were It was a great glory indeed f^^ them to have such
subjects as yo^ for this cause is the woman called t^^ glory of the man:
Comfort your selue^ with this, the glory of your hu^bands is greater now, they
are r^ceived to glory: So is it of you^ Children and dearest friends, who ar^
departed out of this life, CHRIST has received them all to glory, which is the
perfection of all the gifts of God A (...) ^is doctrine serves for the com^^^^
^oth of the living, The 3 use.
and of the (...), so also it serves for counsel (...) living: The counsel is
this, (...) these who are guided with Go^^ counsel, are afterward receiv^^ ^o
glory, strive ye to be guided (...) this counsel: If ye desire to be (...)
after this life, if also ye desire (...) ^aue a comfort behind you to (...)
that shall lament your absence, (...) well so long as ye are here, (...) we
may comfort your mourners (...) this, that CHRIST has recei^^ you to glory.

When a wicked man is dead, Note.
I k^^w not what to say to his spouse: ^^^n a wicked wife is dead, I know (...)
what to say to her husband: what ^^^uld I say to such? Such have alrea^^ their
comforts in their bosom, that (...) or she is well away: Such quie^ly ^^^^gh
in their sleeue, while for shame ^^^nly they must seem to mourn:

This is the just recompense of re^^^d, Note.
that these who serve not GOD in ^^^ir life, shall not be lamented at ^^^ir
death.

They that serve not the LORD here, let them go, let them swelt in their
sweat, let them burn and boil, the world is well quite of them. Note.
When the Scripture speaks of that most vile traitor Judas, it gives him a
disdainful Epitaph, that Act, 1, 16,
he was guide to them that took JESUS: He would never be guided with CHRIST'S
counsel, and therefore now, like a mischant traitor, he lies having this
Epitaph, which shall be read so long as the world stands, Here lies the
Traitor that was guide to them that took JESUS; at his death he was not
lamented: There was not one of the Apostles that ever said once, Alas 1, King,
13, 30.
my brother.

A Prayer.
Now GOD of his grace, so guide us all by his counsel, that AFTERWARD he may
receive us to glory. Amen, Amen.

FINIS.
LAVRVS.
