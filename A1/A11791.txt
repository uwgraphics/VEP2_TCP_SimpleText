NEWS FROM PERNASSVS.

The Political Touchstone, Taken From Mount Pernassus: Whereon the Governments
of the greatest Monarchies of the World are touched.

Printed at Helicon. 1622.

THE PREFACE.
THE truest and securest precepts of Policy are those, which either are drawn
from the prudent resolutions, or unadvised errors of great Princes in the
deliberations of their most important affairs, or from the study of Policy;
all consisting in a severe, and judicious censure of the actions of the Great:
and the studious in Histories, which have the gift to know how to examine them
well, draw out of them most excellent rules, for the wel-governing of many
people: which being very true, it is no marvel, if the best Writers of
matters of State have grown extremely odious to those that reign; by reason,
that as Princes willingly lend an ear to the praises which happen to be given
them, although they come from the pen, or mouth of an impudent Flatterer, so
likewise they have in exceeding abomination all censures which are made upon
their actions: it being an insupportable misery unto them, that their
imprudence, and calamities, should serve for instructions unto others, not to
commit the like faults. This truth assures me, that these my present
Advertisements from Pernassus, (where in a sporting manner the actions,
interests, true ends, and defects of many Princes, not very just, coming to be
censured, touched, discovered, and noted) would bring them infinite
displeasure, if they should be openly published. Whereupon, I, that at any hand
will not give disgust to any person private or public whatsoever, have fully
resolved to keep them from the Press, as from the fire: for the length of
time maturing things, that, which for infinite respects, in our Age is odious,
the present Princes wanting, and those affairs growing old, which now live:
and that in regard of their importance are held in great jealousy, I hope that
these my Labors will then with particular liking be read of the Virtuous,
whom I endeavor to please and delight: In the mean time I have presumed to
hide these my Writings in your Lordships Library, unto whom I present them, to
the end they may be published to the world at such time as they cannot give
distaste to any one. But then my desires shall be accomplished, when these my
Works, such as they are, may give unto your Lordship that satisfaction, which
I so exceedingly desire, in regard of the infinite devotion I bear unto your
Name, and the innumerable obligations, wherein I stand engaged unto you, which
have created me a debtor unto you in so great a sum, that if I should spend
my whole life in your service, yet I should think I had done nothing, but that
still I should die ungrateful.

CHAP. 1. The Spanish Monarchy arrives at Pernassus: beseeches Apollo she may
be cured of an Issue in her arm, and by the Political Physicians is dismissed.
ALthough the Majesty of Apollo had decreed unto the High and Mighty Monarchy
of Spain immediately upon her arrival at this Court (which was some four
months past) not only a solemn entrance, but the public Consistory of the
Learned in the Royal Hall of Audience, with the presence of the Excellent
Muses: yet was it not executed, until two days since, by reason she
consumed all those four months in according with the Princely Poets such
Titles as she was to give, and receive from others: and in agreeing how to
receive, and how to be received in Visitations: whilst the Virtuous stood
amazed, and bitterly complained of the hard condition of these modern times
plagued with the corruption of such vanity: but greater was the affliction of
the Virtuous, because many Learned Princes openly refused to be visited by that
great Queen, saying, That they suspected the receiving some affront from her,
for that they had lately Letters out of Italy, wherein they were advised by
their friends to stand upon their guard, it being the particular custom of the
Spaniards, to go to visit persons more to iniure, then to honor them; and that
therefore it seemed to them a kind of exceeding madness, in stead of avoiding
affronts, to attend them in their houses, and reverently to receive them with
Cappe in hand. And albeit so potent a Monarchy to the great vvonder of all men
had shevved herself much more sparing, in giving to others satisfaction of
Titles, then in bestovving her golden Pistolets; nevertheles she has received
from those Princely Poets, and from all the Virtuous Potentates, that more
regard the substance, then the vanity of things, in this same titular business,
as much content as she could desire. Howbeit, the reputation of so great a
Queen has bin much blemished in this Court, by reason she is seen,
notvvithstanding the extreme necessity that lies upon her for the acquisition
of friends, to show her self too forvvard in alienating such from her, as
desire nothing of her, but satisfaction of words. Further, it has bin
observed for a particular of much note, how the Mr. of the Ceremonies
advertised her, that that great punto she so stands upon, is an odious thing,
only proper to barbarous Kings, and most unworthy so great a Lady, and such a
Princess of Europe as she was: whereunto with much disdain she ansvvered,
How she wondered that he, considering the place he held, should have so little
understanding, as not to know, that a Prince with out gravity, shows like
a Peacocke without a tail. It is not possible to write, with what
curiosity and desire this Princess was expected, nor what a concourse of
people came from all parts of Apolloes State, to look upon this powerful
Queen, that with such a monstrous course of felicity has in so short a time
united under her most spacious Kingdoms, and thereof framed an Empire so
formidable, that there is not a Prince in the world, which for suspicion of
her has not armed himself. The Monarchy of Spain in comparison of those of
France, of England, and other ancient Monarchies, is young in age, but of body
far bigger then any other whatsoever; and according to the proportion of
years she is of, of an unmeasurable greatness: whence it is argued, that if she
continue growing unto that term, wherein humane bodies are wont to come to
their full perfection, she will become so great a Gyantesse, that she will
arrive to that unmeasurable height of the Universal Monarchies, whereunto the
Romans Monarchy attained: but the accidents of matters of State affirm for
certain, that she will never be bigger: and that she was as high in her tendrest
years, as ever she will be in any time to come whatsoever. The which is plainly
demo^strated by this apparent argument, that in these present times she has
grown more slovvly half a fingers breadth, then she did two handfulls in
times past. This mighty Lady is of complexion very tavvny, much inclyning to
the Moore: therefore her customs are rather proud, then grave; and in all her
actions, has more of the cruel, then the severe: so that not having been
able, nor desirous to learn that art (so necessary for a Prince) of pardoning,
it is the firm opinion of many, that thereby her greatness is the more
impeached: for placing her estimation upon nothing more, then to be called the
Mistress of Nations, in the knowledge of being most resolute to strike off the
heads of such odious Poppies, as in the gardens of her States overtop their
fellows, she rejoices not a little, that she is said in that sort to have
gone beyond that Tarquin the Great, who was the first inventor of such a
secret. Being then so resolute in the execution of seuerities, she is much
perplexed in conferring of graces, which are seen to proceed very seldom
from her; and those too she does, are granted with so much authority, as they
are not very acceptable: Howbeit in appearance, she is all mildnes, and wholy
dissolved into Complements: but he that with the political Spectacle knovveth
how to penetrate into the inward of the heart, shall discover her to be all
pride, all covetousness, and cruelty; in such sort, that they which have long
negotiated with her, report; That there is not any Princess from whom come
sweeter words, and bitterer deeds: whereby it happens, that as a friend
she greatly allureth men, and as a Mistres exceedingly terrifieth them. Her
hands be out of all proportion long, which she extends every where, as may
be most for her profit, without discerning friend from foe, or a stranger from
a kinsman: She has the nails of an Harpy most rapacious; with fingers of so
hard and strong a tenure, that she never lets go any thing, which she once
fastneth on. Her eyes be black, and of a merveilous sharp sight: She looks
afquint, so that fixing her eye upon one, she attentively beholds another: (a
matter of much danger to Princes for of late years, having set her face upon
Argier, before any body was aware, she fastened her look upon (...). And in
those eyes is discovered a world of greedines, because she never beholdes any
thing, that she does not earnestly covet with her heart; vvhereupon the
Speculatiue affirm, That this Queen is enflamed with an immoderate thirst of
others Estates; and she never had friend, whom in a short time with sundry
devises she made not a slave. All which do manifest unto the world, that she
is fitter to govern slaves then freemen. She stands so much upon the punto
of State, that she will not vouchsafe to stir a foot for to encounter good
occasions, which many times have gone home even to her own doors to find
her out. She goes beyond all other Queens whatsoever, either past or
present, in the knowledge how to cover with the cloak of hypocrisy any
interest of hers, though never so diabolical: and albeit she is seen daily to
enter into actions that are none of the best, yet she makes ostentation of
nothing more, then of her Conscience. Whence the French, so often deceived
under color of most holy pretexts, have at length to their cost learned to
arm themselves, and get to horse, as soon as they once hear her propound
matters full of pretenses of Religion, and blessed Charity toward her most
beloved Neighbor. She is so excellent in the exercise of horsemanship, that she
has not only with good fortune tamed the generous Courses of Naples, but also
made gentle even those most vicious mules of Spain, that by their natural
instinct are so vvilde and unruly. She is above all other Ladies most
suspicious, insomuch that, her own Nation excepted, she trusts not any of
all those that are subject unto her, though upon all occasions she has proved
them most faithful: a matter of such prejudice unto her, that the
understanding part of the world plainly say, how for that only most important
defect, it is not possible she should ever grow greater: And this happens,
because no Prince living eareth less then she to be loved of her people,
placing all her study how to make her self to be feared. Whereupon the
Politicians: have observed it as a kind of very great madness in her, to be so
confidently persuaded as she is, that she can dravv people to adore her by
oppressing them: Nevertheless, with these so odious Customs she allureth all
men unto her service, for the infinite abundance of her treasures is that
calamity, which with such violence haleth unto her even those minds, that are
bound to abhor her. She is most accurate in petty things, but in great
affairs no other Queen has suffered herself to be more easily deceived. In
discoursing of, and resolving importa^t matters, she shows admirable
understanding and prudence; but either by her natural sloth, or the cunning of
her ministers, most covetous Merchants of great businesses; or because it
seems unto her, that no resolution is made with Decorum, if it be not a long
time expected by the World, she executes her resolutions with so much delay,
that the face of affairs changing with the time, those resolutions which have
been most prudently deliberated, have often proved unfortunate. And therefore
it is the opinion of all men, that she is more able in laying of Plots, then in
the managing of Arms, wherein she has great courage, exceeding constancy,
unspeakable patience of all discommodities: but so little resolution, that her
extraordinary circumspection has many times the face of fear: whereupon she
seems more apt to maintain, then conquer States. There are many singular
men, that laugh at her, for ruling all her actions by such solid and mature
counsels, without ever venturing any in the hand of that Chance, and Fate
which have so favored, and made glorious the French, when as on occasions
they have been carried more by valor, then discretion: And some are of the
mind, how that only proceeds, from her being as sparing of her own blood,
as she is thirsty after others: Whence it is, that the most understanding
Captains in the Art of war, deride her, for aspiring to the Empire of the
World, and yet will never fight: for this mighty Queen being resolved to make
acquisition of great States by marriages, she abhors that dreadful custom
of the French, to buy others Kingdoms with the price of their own blood.
Being then more advised then courageous, she is more dangerous to her friend in
peace, then to her enemy in war; wherefore the French, that hitherto have
lived with her in a supine negligence, have at length, after so many calamities
learned to double bar the door when once they have concluded a peace with
the Spaniards. She is most careless of her own, but so greedy of others
riches, that she cares not to waste her own patrimoniall estates, so as
thereby she may get another. She is so close, so reserved, that it is not
possible for any cunning of man to find out her ends: but he that will judge of
the disposition and customs of such a Lady, must be fully persuaded, that in
all the affairs which either she manageth herself, or others have to
negotiate with her, she is within quite contrary to that she appears without.
And albeit that amongst the aforesaid virtues, she has so notorious vices, yet
by the greatness of her fortune every thing in her is interpreted, and admired
for Virtue: so that many wise Princes hold it an honor to imitate her, even in
vices. She is of constitution very strong: whereupon it is concluded, that she
is long-liu'd, only she suffers in the indisposition of the distraction of
her members; a matter that does infinitely weaken so great a Body: and although
with the aid of the liberty of Genoa, and the alliance she has with the Duke
of Savoy, she uses many devises to unite them: yet by the diversity of the
interests of those Potentates, she prevails little. But such a Princess by
nothing receives so much prejudice, as by her principal ministers the
Spaniards, whose services alone she uses in the greatest Charges, exercised by
them with so much insolency and odious pride, (...) they will not be honored as
men, but adored as gods: an impertinence, that has made the Spanish Dominion
distasifull, not only to the Italians and Flemmings, but even to the very
Spaniards themselves.

This mighty Princess then, appearing in the Royal Hall before the Majesty of
Apollo, she caused her servants to unbind her left arm, and showing it naked
unto Apollo, and to all the sacred College of the Learned, she spoke in this
manner: Lord, and Father of good letters, this which you see, is that same
stinking Issue of Flanders, which the French, the Germans, and some Italian
Princes, which seem my friends, and that in bowelled beyond. Sea Renegada,
made me so many years since, out of the suspicion they had of me. I grant,
that the Princes I have named, had just cause to be jealous of my power, at
such time, as after the death of Henry the second, they saw France fallen into
the calamity of infant Kings; and that in their minority, I sought to sow
dissension in that Kingdom: But now that those suspicions are vvanting, and
that in the great contention which I had with the French; and particularly
with that same vnchayned Prince of Bea^ne, I was condemned in costs, I do
beseech of your Majesty, that so fastidious an Issue may be stopped, since
every one sees, that by the great abundance of humors, which are there
concurring, it is become so raging a Canker, that I pray God, it does not end
with the ruin of the whole. I did not pass into Italy through mine own
ambition, nor had that ardent desire to possess my self wholly of it, as mine
enemies affirm: it is well known, that I was called, nay, forethly ha^^^
thither by the Princes of Italy themselves, to deliver them from the great
fear they were in, of the domination of the French. And happy had it been for
my House of Spain, which I had covered with Slate of silver, and Tyles of
massy gold, if I never had had any thing to do with the Italians; a double
dealing Nation, full of deceits, and interests, and only good to imbarke men
in dangerous affairs without Biscuit, and then to abandon them in the midst
of greatest perils, making profession of nothing more, then to fare well at
other men's costs: And it seems marvelous strange to me, that Italy, which
(as every man knows) has suffered her self to be towzed by so many strange
Nations, should now make such profession of chastity to me; that if she see
me never so little to move, she enters straight into a jealousy, that I
will deprive her of the honor of her Liberty. And albeit the greatness,
wherein the Kingdom of France stands at this instant, secureth Italy, and
all the Princes which I have named, from the fear they are in of my power; yet
when it shall so seem good to your Majesty, I am ready to give security to
every one, of not offending, so that this same fastidious Issue of mine may be
stopped.

By order then of his Majesty, the Issue then was diligently considered by the
political Physicians; and having made an exquisite consultation thereupon,
they delivered, That in regard the Spanish Monarchy was troubled with an ardent
th^rit of Domination, that Issue was necessary for her, whereby those gross
humors might be purged away; which from Peru distilled down into her stomach,
and caused that unquenchable thirst. And those worthy Physicians considered,
that if the said Monarchy had not that Issue, there was manifest danger, that
the pernicious humors of Peru, would mount up into the head of Italy, with
apparent ruin of the principal members, which now remain free in her; and
that the said Monarchy of Spain would fall into the Dropsy of an Universal
Monarchy: to avoid which inconveniences, nothing was so proper, said they, as
that same Issue of Flanders, which was to be kept open, so long as Peru
ministered those pernicious humors to the Monarchy of Spain.

This resolution greatly displeased the Spanish Monarchy, whereupon being much
incensed, she said thus; Sir, if through the malice of others I must so foully
consume away my self in ministering ointments to the Canker, which my enemies
call a divertiue Issue, some peradventure, that little dream of it, shall have
their share in it: This was presently apprehended by the English, the French,
and Italians; who replied; That they cared not a rush for any thing she could
do: for they sent but the refuse of their States in to Flanders, whereas the
Spaniards consumed Gold, and vital blood there: And that to secure themselves
from the formidable power, and ambition of the Spanish, which appeared to have
no Horizon, the English, French, Germans, and Italians, were forced conformable
to the Aphorism of the political Hipocrates, Tacitus: Consilijs and estu res
externas moliri arma procul habere.

CHAP. 2. The Monarchy of Spain lamenteth, for that her Falsehoods are
discovered.
I Know not whether it were by accident, or by the malice of some Frenchmen,
or indeed (as many have grievously suspected) by the plottings of that nation,
which is such an implacable enemy to the French: but so it was, that many
years since, the Royal Palace of the Monarchy of France was set on fire, and
so great was the Flame, and so terribly did it burn, that the neighboring
Monarchies were in extreme fear, lest that fire would end with the ruin of
their States: in such sort, that for the preservation of their own, every one
ran to the extinguishing of the flame of another house. The English, though
natural enemies to the French, brought thither the waters of their Thames; the
Germans those of the Mose, and of the Rhine; the Venetians emptied almost all
their Lakes. And in truth it was a mervailous thing to see, that even the
Monarchy of Spain her self, (esteemed so cruel an enemy to the French) should
labor amongst the chiefest friends, to extinguish that fire; whereas the
common fame went, she would rather have rejoiced to have warmed herself at it:
whereupon every one remained much astonished, when they saw, that with care,
and unspeakable charity, she not only brought thither her waters of Tagus,
and Iberus, but even the boundless Ocean it self; whereof, when the English,
and Hollanders will permit her, she is absolute Mistres. Howbeit, some
Politicians sinisterly interpreting the charity of the Spaniards, publicly
affirmed, that it was a pernicious matter in the occasions of the French to
admit the assistance of the Spaniards, who being eternal and capital enemies
to France, were rather to be recounted Architects of every French ruin, then
zealous of the greatness of that Kingdom as men, that measuring all the
actions of those, which reign in the works of Princes, with the only Compass
of their interest, many times do not admit even piety toward God, much less
charity toward men. But these Politicians were so much the more held in
abomination with the world, by how much it was most apparent, that the
Spaniards in their diligence, and charity to bring water unto that fire, not
only equalled, but went beyond any friend whatsoever of the French: And that
which increased all mervaile, and brought high reputation to the Monarchy of
Spain with simple men, was, that Flanders, and Austria, her ancientest
patrimonies, burning with the cruel flames of war, she had preferred the
safety of the French, before the care of her own affairs. Now because neither
humane labor, nor any quantity of water was sufficient to extinguish the least
spark of such a dreadful fire, but rather the flames of those bloody civil
wars, notwithstanding all diligence, and remedies, daily more and more
increased; even good men, and the deuoutest Simplicities began to lend an ear
unto the advice of the Politicians, and to suspect, that the charity of the
Spanish Monarchy was altogether interest, which indeed is right Spanish
charity; so that they resolved no longer to give credit to apparences, but to
look into them, and see what matter it was, that the Spaniards brought in
their Barrels: and they found, that in stead of water, to quench the fire, they
were filled with Pitch, Oil, Rozin, and diabolical dissentions, to increase
it; which treachery also some French Barons were discovered to use, who more
then others making profession of extraordinary charity, employed those
Barrels, and the matter in them, lent them by the Spaniards: Whereupon, with
just indignation they were slain by the French Monarchy, and burned in the
very same fire, which with such sedition, and infidelity they had nourished
in their Country. And the Spaniards were not only chased away from that Work,
but with sound of Trumpet proclaimed and published for Hypocrites; and by a
particular Edict of the French Monarchy, the World was made to know, that if
ever in time to come, there were any one found, that could be induced to
believe, how any kind of charity could fall into the minds of the Spaniards
toward the French, he should be held, and reputed for a notorious Simplicity:
and that, if after the first admonition he should persevere in his error, as
malicious, and seditious, he should be tossed in a Blanket.

It was strange to see, how the Spaniards, and those French before-named, had
no sooner abstained from that Work, but that the inflammation of France,
which before was so great, that even men of the best judgment affirmed, how
it was not possible to be extinguished by any humane means, ceased of it
self: Whereupon, the famous Flowers-de-luce of Gold so trampled on before,
rose up more resplendent and flourishing, then ever they were; and France,
that through the excessive ambition of many, had been cruelly tormented for
forty years together and better, became (to the great marvel of all men)
quiet, and pacified in the twinkling of an eye: so that then it evidently
appeared, that the Spaniards were the first Authors of that fire in France,
which with such far pretenses of Religion and charity, they have labored to
make the world believe they would so feign have extinguished. It is generally
reported, that the Monarchy of Spain retired herself into her Royal Palace,
and how for a long time together she would not suffer herself to be seen of
any one, giving her self over to a deep Melancholy, and with abundance of
tears freely acknowledging, that she would rather have lost two of the best
Kingdoms she had, then see the world condemn, and deride those holy
pretenses of hers, with which she had so often, to her infinite comodity, sold
even the most stinking Assafetida for Musk, and Ambergriece: for now it seemed
unto her that she remained without her richest treasure, and that she had lost
the inexhaustible Mines of Gold and Silver of Peru, and of all the new World,
seeing she was deprived of the benefit of being able ever after to make the
simple multitude believe, that black was white; thinking it withal a very
hard case to be driven to that fearful pass, wherein she had always seen
the French, that she must be forced to make acquisition of Kingdoms, only with
the point of the sword; whereas in times past, with the sole apparences of her
holy pretexts, which had served her in stead of a most flourishing army, she
had put the whole world into combustion: And that it exceedingly grieved her to
be fallen into such an ill opinion with men, that she was in danger for the
time to come, not to be believed any more in the truth; where before, the
dissimulation of false pretenses, and of the openest Hypocrisy that might be,
carried the credit of most sacred Truth, and of most perfect Devotion.

CHAP. 3. Maximilian the Emperor is advertised of the Troubles begun among his
Sons.
THere came three Posts very lately unto the Majesty of the Emperor
Maximilian the second; and presently it was known, how they brought him
advertisement, that the Archduke Matthias had taken Arms against the Emperor
Rodolphus his Brother, seditiously requiring the Kingdoms of Hungary and
Bohemia, and the absolute Dominion of Austria, and other Provinces. These ill
news infinitely troubled the mind of the Emperor; for he well knew, that the
discord risen up among his Sons, would give the enemies of the House of
Austria that content, which they so much desired. Whereupon, yesterday morning
very early, that Prince presented himself before Apollo, and with many tears
demanded of him, when the evils of the House of Austria, so long before
commenced, through the cruel combination of all Germany against it, should
have an end; and for what demerit such fearful scourges were sent unto his
House. Unto this demand Apollo answered in this sort: All the troubles and
persecutions of your Family, great Emperor, shall cease, when it shall
wholy abandon those ambitious thoughts of desiring to command over Hungary,
and Transylvania; which has given unto Germany such iealousies, that to
secure her ancient Liberty from the power of your House, she bends all her
study to nothing more, then to the depression of it: for the Germans, fearing
greater prejudice from your acquests, then from the victories of the Turks,
are fully resolved rather to lose Vienna, then recover Buda. And then also
shall all Germany unfeignedly love your Archdukes, when deposing their present
ambition, they shall make it appear, that they desire to be equal, and not
superior to other Princes of Germany.

CHAP. 4. Philip the second King of Spain, after some contestation about his
Title, enters with great pomp into Pernassus.
THe mighty King of Spain, Philip the second, who (some two months since
arrived at this Court, was not permitted before yesterday to make a public
and solemn entry, because that on certain Tryumphall Arches, which with a
Royal magnificence were erected unto him by the Spanish Nation, these words
were written: Philippo secundo Hispaniarum, vtriussque Siciliae, and Indiarum
Regi Catholico, Italiae pacis Auctori foelicissim^. Which distasting the
greater part of the Italian Princes, they required them to be cancelled,
saying: That they would not at any hand acknowledge from the Spaniards that
peace of Italy, which with ready money they bought of the Hollanders. This
aromaticall matter was a long time disputed, and albeit the Italian Princes had
concludingly proved in judgment, that the present peace of Italy was not to be
acknowledged from the good minds of the Spaniards, who would have seized on it
all, had it not been for that great diuersion, but altogether from the wars
of Flanders, yet in the greatest heat of this contention, the Queen of Italy
with her wonted prudence pacified the matter; for having called all her Princes
together, she advised them to leave ostentation, and vainglory to the
Spaniards, and applying themselves to substantial things to continue feeding
them with breath. The concourse both for number, and quality of Princes which
assembled to grace, and serve so great a King, was the greatest, and the
honorablest, that ever Pernassus had seen. And so powerful a Prince had place
amongst those Monarchs, which are famous in the world more for prudence, and
advisednes used in peace, then for valor showed in war: and greatly did the
Learned marvel at the Imprese, which he carried painted in his Standard
general, of a writing pen, wherewithal, by the testimony of Historians it
plainly appeared, that in the potent Kingdom of France, and other places,
where good occasion had been presented unto him to employ it, he had caused
greater batteries and ruins, then Charles the fifth his Father had done, or
could do with most part of the Cannons of all Europe. An Imprese, that was much
commended by the sacred College of the Virtuous, it being greatly to the honor
of all Writers, that a Pen in the hand of a man, who knew how to manage it,
could work such memorable effects. So mighty a King was entreated in
Pernassus, alla grande; for even the chiefest Monarchs of Christendom thought
it a great reputation unto them forto be able to serve him, insomuch that the
day after his entry, being under the Barbers hand, the famous Queen of England
continually held the basin up close to his beard; and the warlike King of
France, Henry the fourth, counted it a great glory unto him to wash his head,
the which he performed with such excellent dexterity, as if he had been
borne for the Trade, although some malignants have published, that it was
without Soape, and only with very strong and sharp Lie.

This great Monarch was presented by all the Virtuous of Pernassus with sundry
Presents of Poesy, and other most elaborate Writings; the which he exchanged
with much liberality: And to a learned personage, that presented him with a
most worthy and honest Discourse, wherein he showed the way, how the noble
Parthenope, and the whole Kingdom of Naples, that by the robberies of
Soldiers, corruption of Judges, oppressions of Great-men, and by the general
ransackings of the ravenous Viceroys, which from Spain are sent thither to be
fatned, is now come to utter desolation, may be made to return unto the
ancient greatness of his splendor, he gave twenty Ducats, and consigned the
Discourse to his Confessor; charging him to yield him a good account of it, as
of a Work, that was very holily written: But unto a sufficient Politician,
that presented him with a long Discourse, howbeit clean contrary to the
former, entreating of the means which was to be used, for afflicting the said
Kingdom of Naples more then now it is; and how it might be reduced to such
calamity and misery, that the generous Steed, which without Bridle and Saddle,
the Seat of State does (with ill fortune) carry for Imprese, should patiently
endure both Pack-saddle, and Burdens; yea, and quietly draw in the Coach too:
because he held that to be understandingly written, according to the true
terms of good Policy, he gave twelve thousand Crowns a year, and created
him a Grande of Spain.

CHAP. 5. Most of the Princes, Common-vveales, and States of Europe, are
weighed in a pair of Scales by Lorenzo Medici.
SEeing it is apparent, that the Roman Commonweal, after the acquisition it
had made of the Empire of all Italy, could in a short time arrive to that
Universal Monarchy, which is yet so famous to the World, and whereunto many
ambitious Princes have since in vain aspired, it has been a general
received Opinion, That that Potentate, who in State and Forces is suffered to
grow unto such greatness, that he finds no other Prince able to
counterpoyze him, no more then the Roman Commonweal did, after it became
Commander over Italy, cannot possibly be impeached from obtaining the
Universal Monarchy. Whereupon those Empires and Kingdoms, which were
afterward framed out of the pieces of the Roman Monarchy, to avoid those
calamities and dissolutions, which fell upon such Potentates as were oppressed
by the Roman Forces, out of most wholesome, and almost divine counsel agreed
together, that every fifteenth year, all the Princes of Europe should assemble
into one place; where each ones Forces should be severally weighed; and
thereupon fit counterpoyze, and due mortification be given unto him, that was
found to be grown to any greatness, which might be odious and dangerous to
his Competitor.

Many great Wits were from time to time preferred to that honorable charge of
governing the Scales; but for an hundredth years past or thereabout, they were
managed by the Illustrious House of Medici, and in particular by Lerenzo the
Great. Which prerogative, although to many it seemed prejudicial unto the
Majesty of the Popes, and prudence of the Venetian Senate, who have always
watched; if not more, at leastwise equally with Lorenzo, and the Florentine
Commonweal, to maintain both in Italy and abroad, the Forces of the
Potentates of Europe evenballanced, yet with a marvailous consent of all the
Historians the government of the Scales was given into the hands of Signior
Lorenzo. The first day of August, then all the Princes and Potentates of
Europe, assembled in Phocis, not only to meet with so important a business as
the perfect knowledge of their own affairs, but that also of others, which in
matter of State imports much more. Whereupon, by an ancient and just
prerogative, the first that came to be weighed, was the Aristocraticall
Monarchy of the Apostolic Sea, whose temporal State was put into the Scale;
and because the weight of the last fifteenth year was but six Millions of
pounds, and now was found to amount unto seven and an half, every one knew,
that the addition of the noble Duchy of Ferrara had caused that increase. The
next that was put into the Scale, was the State of the seven Princes Electors
of the Roman Empire, which by old Records appears to have weighed in times
past seventy Millions of pounds; but since, by the indiscreet government and
courses of many Emperors, that lusty complexion, which made it evermore
redoubted, was so spoiled, that it fell into those dangerous and foul
infirmities, which after a long Quartane, found end in an Hecticke Fever, that
has now so consumed it, as our Age beholds it left with nothing but very
skin and bone. Howbeit, though it be so much decreased in state, yet the
great bulk it has of body, makes it in show very goodly to look upon; the
rather, because the intrinsecall imperfections are not discovered: for many
good persons with the ancient Titles of the Empire, and maiesticall Name of
Caesar, have beautified it very excellently without, but when it came to be
weighed, it was found quite empty within; a feather not being so light, as the
name of a Prince without authority is vain: whence it is, that the Roman
Empire proved so weak, as it weighed but 480 pounds. Then the famous Peers of
France brought unto the Scale the flourishing and warlike French Monarchy; a
square of five hundredth and fifty Miles every way, replenished with an infinite
Noblesse, armed on horseback, which not only maintains peace at home, but
makes so great a King formidable to all the Nations of the earth; besides a
world of learned men, which adorn it; Merchandise and Trades which enrich it;
Tillage and Husbandry, which make it plentiful, and abounding with every good
thing. The ancient weight of so famous a Monarchy was twenty Millions of
pounds; but in the last fifteenth years weight, by reason of the horrible
calamities, whereinto (by the disloyalty of some of her Barons) she was
thrown, it did not arrive to twelve Millions; howbeit now it not only
equalled, but went far beyond the weight of the best ancient times; for it
came to five and twenty Millions; a matter of such marvel to everyone, that
the Spaniards got on their Spectacles, and very narrowly observed, whether the
Weights were right or no.

To the ancient King^dome of France was added the acquisition of Bresse given
up by the Duke of Savoy, which in regard it was so advantageous to the City of
Lions, augmented the weight of it above a Million. Next were the many Kingdoms
of Spain put into the Scale by the Spanish Grandes, and to the great wonder of
those ancient men, that could remember, how an hundredth and twenty years since,
they were held in a poor and vile account, the weight amounted to twenty
Millions. The Spaniards remained exceeding well satisfied with this weight of
their Spain: and assured themselves, that with the addition of so many other
States, they had besides to put into the Scale, not only to equal, but far
to exceed the five and twenty Millions of the French Monarchy. Wherefore
instantly they put into the Scale the flourishing Kingdom of Naples, which
every one thinking would increase the weight at least two Millions more; it
appears, that then it weighed less by one and an half: at this strange
accident the Spaniards being much amazed, said: That either Lorenzo had used
some fraud in the weighing, or that of necessity the Scales were not even;
because it was a monstrous thing, that the addition of matter should abate of
the weight. Whereunto Lorenzo coldly answered; That his Scales were even; but
that neither the Indiaes void of inhabitants, nor the Neopolitans, and
Milanese, which were so far distant from the Forces of Spain, and
replenished with a people, which so unwillingly supported the command of
strangers, weighed any thing at all: for it was the love and multitude of
subjects, the fertility and union of States, that give weight, and turn the
Scale.

Hereupon the Spaniards added the Duchy of Milan into the Scale, which in like
manner abated a Million of the weight; whereat also the Spaniards were so much
astonished, that they would not put Flanders into the Scale, fearing to receive a
greater distaste and affront. Howbeit some said, that if they had put in the
Indiaes, they might have wrought some good effect, but not those miracles,
which certain lavish toungs have delivered; who with the same facility talk
of Millions of Crowns that the furnace-men make of very brick and tyle. Then
came the English Lords, who put into the Scale their Kingdom, so much
redoubted for the strength of the wonderful scytuation thereof; for the
continued Mountains, which compass it about serving for walls, made by the
very powerful hand of God in form of bulwarks, and the Ocean for most
profound ditches, make it a Kingdom feared, in regard of the commodity it has
to assail others; and the insuperable difficulties, which they shall find,
that offer to attempt it. The weight of this Kingdom was answerable to that of
the last fifteenth year, which amounted to sixteen Millions. But the English
to give more weight to their Kingdom, would have put the Kingdom of Scotland
into the Scale; when the Scottish Nobility with drawn swords in their hands
opposed themselves; freely protesting, that they would never suffer their
Country to be annexed to the Kingdom of the English; for yet fresh was the
lamentable example of the miseries of Flanders, who when she saw her Earls
become Kings of Spain, foolishly believed that she should command over the
Spaniards; whereas soon after, not Spain was sacked by the Flemmings, but
Flanders by the covetous and cruel Spaniards; and that which made up their
misery, Charles the fifth the Emperor, and King Philip his son, by their
continual residence in Spain, of Flemmings became Spaniards. The unfortunate
Flemmings by losing their Prince, of natural subjects, grew to be esteemed
strangers, and men of little faith. And so Flanders, the natural Country of
Charles the fifth, the Patrimony of King Philip, became (according to the
terms of modern Policy) a State of five States, and began to be governed by
strangers; with those jealousies, and with those oppressions of Customs,
Taxes, Contributions, and Donatiues, as begat those bad humors, those ill
satisfactions, from whence since has proceeded that civil war, which after
an unspeakable profusion of Gold, an infinite effusion of blood, an incredible
loss of honor to the Flemmings, was converted into a covetous merchandise of
the Spaniards. Therefore the Scots by such lamentable miseries have learned,
not to permit their King upon any terms whatsoever, to abandon the Royal
Seat of his ancient Kingdom, for to place it in a greater, newly fallen unto
him: in which case the Scots should under their cruel enemies the English, be
sure to suffer all the calamities, which inferior Nations are wont to endure
at the hands of the superior.

Some that were present at this Act report, how the Spaniards told the King of
England, that those Scots which had spoken so arrogantly in the presence of his
Majesty, were to be severely chastised; to whom the King of England answered,
That the Spaniards ought not to give that counsel unto others, which had
proved so pernicious to themselves: and thereupon having commanded the stay of
weighing their Kingdom, he assured his Scots, that ere long he would give
them all possible satisfaction.

After this, the vast Ottoman Empire was put into the Scale; which the last
fifteenth year arrived to the sum of two and thirty Millions, but now was
found to be less then sixteen; the strangeness whereof made all the Princes
very much to marvel; and particularly the Venetians, who could not believe
such a fall; whereupon they desired, that with more diligence it might be
reweighed; and it appeared, how in that little time running between the first
and this second weighing, it had fallen eight hundredth twenty and two pounds;
whereby it was manifest, that the Ottoman Empire, heretofore so terrible to the
world, now consumed with luxury, covetuousnesse, and idleness, runs
headlong to his ruin, which gave great contentment to all those Princes.
Nevertheles, it was observed by some of the wisest there present, that the
Spaniards were not so glad of it as the rest; out of a doubt they had, that the
depression of the Turk, would be the exaltation of the Venetian State. Then
came the Polach Senators, and put into the Scale their Kingdom, which in
regard of the small authority the King has there, and the too much command,
which the Palatines arrogate unto themselves, made but a poor reckoning; for
it did not amount to six Millions of pounds, whereas in times past it always
exceeded twelve. After them, the Signory of the Council of Tenn put into the
Scale the flourishing estate of the Venetian Commonwealth, most admirable for
the greatness thereof, and opportunity of situation fitting for all great
enterprises, which went beyond all expectation in the weight, for it came to
eight Millions; the cause whereof was said to be the huge mass of Gold, which
those wise Senators in so long a time of peace had gathered together into their
Treasury. Next came the Swittzers, the Grisons, and other free people of
Germany, and brought their Comonweales to the Scale. How beit the Princes
required, that they might be weighed each one severally by it self, wherewith
the Germans were well contented, so that it might be done. But Lorenzo having
put the Commonwealth of Basil into the Scale, it appeared, that the greater
part of the other Commonweals of Germany were all so linked together, that it
was impossible to separate them one from another, which put a many of ambitious
Princes there in a sweat. Then the Duke of Savoy caused his State to be put
into the Scale by his noble Knights of the Annonciata, which equalled the
weight of the last fifteenth year; but Lorenzo, having added into the Scale
that most noble prerogative of Title, which the said Duke Charles Emanuell
enjoys of the Prime Souldyer of Italy, it was seen to aggravate the weight a
Million four hundredth and twenty pounds. After this, with a pomp and Majesty
matchable to Kings, appeared the Duke of Lorraine; whose State, though little,
equalled the weight of great Kingdoms; and it was considered that it fell out
to be so by a certain good fortune which that Prince had, to have his States
so happily seated, that he could easily put the Lowe-Countreys into grievous
difficulties, by impeaching the passage of those succors, which the Spaniards
conduct thither out of Italy, whereby he has grown into such reputation, that
to the most offerer he sells for ready Gold the merchandise of that his
adhering; in such sort, that after he had dreyned the Spaniards, as much as any
the devoutest French Lord of the Holy League whatsoever, syding afterward with
the French, he knew so well how to change his copy, that a King of France,
such as was Henry the fourth, the great Duke of Toscan, and the Duke of
Mantoua, were glad of his alliance. And fully to make up the Spaniards
iealousye, the famous Venetian Commonwealth drew into her pay a Prince of that
House with such affection, that if that great Lady had not made a vow of
perpetual chastity, and her nature (according to the custom of some Indians,)
had not been stytched up the first day she was borne by the Venetian Signory,
most jelous of her honor, it was verily believed by many, that she would have
taken him to husband. It was observed, that the Duke of Savoy envyed much the
felicity of this Prince; because he finding himself also seated between the
French and the Spaniards of Milan, as the Duke of Loraine was between the
French and the Spaniards of Flanders, in stead of so many benefits, and so many
commodities, as fell upon the Duke of Loraine, he had received most cruel
kickes, not only from the French then his enemies, but from the Spaniards his
friends; so that it was evident, the Duke of Savoy did now plainly see, how
that practice of his with the Spanyard, was most pernicious for him. Then came
the Otto di Balia, and put into the Scale the flourishing State of the Great
Dukes of Tos^^ which by reason of the excellent wits of the inhabitants,
perpetual plenty, continual peace, and quiet security it enjoys, answered
in weight to many Kingdoms. Lorenzo greatly rejoiced, when he saw how upon the
foundations of those Churches and Hospitals, which he and his Predecessors in
the time of the Florentine liberty had laid in their Country, their
Successors, according to the model left them by Cosimo the Great, had
afterward found means to erect strong Cyttadels; whereupon Lorenzo, to make a
glorious show of the worth and wisdom of the Princes of his House, added into
the Scale the admirable understanding of Ferdinand the Great, with the
excessive weight whereof it was so overcharged, that the huge chain whereby it
hung brake in two, so that all went to ground. This accident of the Scales so
broken, was an hinderance that other Italian Princes, which remained, could not
be weighed; whereupon it was concluded, that coming, according to the ancient
custom, to lay all the Princes and Potentates of Italy in balance against the
Monarchy of Spain, out of the universal weight of the Italian Princes, each
ones particular would easily appear. Into the midst of the great Hall then was
brought an huge, and even pair of Balance, whereinto on the one part was put
all the Kingdoms of the Monarchy of Spain, and into the other all the
principalities of Italy; and it was seen that they stood in equal Balance; a
matter of great trouble to all the Italian Princes: but whilst they continued
in this agony, it was noted, how the mighty French Monarchy with one only
loving look, which she gave to that Balance, wherein the Italian
Principalities lay, made it suddenly to turn on that side. It may not be
omitted, how to Spaniards seeing the Dukes of Savoy, who the last fift^^^ year
refused to be weighed with the Italian Forces, (...) to be put into the
Balance, for to counterpoyse theirs, threatened them by biting their thumbs at
them; whereof those Princes being aware, with a generosity worthy their
undaunted spirits, they say thus unto them: Signory of Spain, ye can no
longer feed men with hopes, for now we are thoroughly possessed of your courses:
Ye thought to have brought the Dukes of Savoy by the cunning of your hopes to
such a madness, as to forgo that little bread, which they had in the mouth of
their State; to reach at the shadow of those great inheritances of Spain,
which they saw in the bottom in the water. And because the Spaniards
complained for that the Dukes of Parma, Modena, Vrbin, the Lords of Mirandola,
and the famous Roman Barons, Gartani, Colonesi, and Orsini, which have the
Fleece, and are in their pay, were weighed with the Italian Forces; whereas in
regard of that Order, and the Pensions they receive, they were obliged to
adhere to their deseignes, and to be the ministers of their greatness. They
were answered by those Lords, that they received the honors of the Fleece, and
enjoyed the profits of those Pensions, as honorable Ladies accept of gifts from
their Lovers, only in a pure way of curtesy, and not with an intent any way to
forget what appertains to their honor.

CHAP. 6. The Spanish Monarchy goes to the Oracle at Delphos, for to know
whether ever she shall attain to the Monarchy of the world, and receives a
contrary answer.
YEsterday morning two hours before day, the renowned Monarchy of Spain
departed with great secrecy, in a Caroch of six horses from Pernassus,
carrying along with her only some few Confederates of her Court, which begat
a world of jealousy; but in particular the French Monarchy was so moved, that
to be ascertained of this voyage, she presently took Post, and following the
Monarchy of Spain, she overtooke her just as she was entering into the Oracle
of Apollo at Delphos; before whom presenting herself, by report of them that
by chance were then present, she made this ensuing request: O eternal, and
clear Lamp of the world; thou right Eye of Heaven, that not only bring
day, but every good else to mankind: Thou know, that for a long time
together, all my thoughts have aimed at that Universal Monarchy, whereunto the
Roman people only arrived: Thou know what effusion of blood, what
profusion of Treasure I have made, to attain unto the end of my intent: To
thee only are known the watchings, the sweat, and those so artificial
endeavors of mine which I have used, to bring so important a Deseigne to pass:
Thou know also, that by the valor of my Nation, by the dexterity of my wit,
and by the power of my money, not many years since, at such time, as I had
sown those turbulencies of civil wars in France, whereon I had grounded all
my hopes, I was near unto the obtaining of my intent; nothing remaining for me
to overcome all impediments, but to unite Naples with Milan; a difficulty,
which if I can once surmount, I may then securely boast that I have gotten the
day: But seeing that either by my fatal misfortune, or by the impossibility of
the affayre, or by the power of so many cruel enemies, which declared
themselves against me, the scandals of those revolutions, which with such
devises in the space of so long a time, I had sown amongst the French, over
whom yet I could never prevail, were in one only day converted into such
peace and tranquillity, as it breaks my heart to behold it; and that after
the wasting of so many of my people, whom in this enterprise, that I have
propounded to my self, I have almost reduced to utter desolation, I am in the
end become even the fable of the world: Therefore do I thus present my self
before thy Majesty, whom I most humbly beseech, to let me clearly
understand, whether that Universal Monarchy, which is so imprinted in my
heart, and which is the only end of all my actions, be destinated by the will
of Heaven to me, and my Nation: and this I desire to know, that either by the
impossibility of the matter, I may be constrained to give it over, or by the
possibility thereof, I may encourage my Spaniards to go on cheerfully in
their attempts: for to confess the truth unto thee, that know the secrets
of thoughts, in regard of so many crosses, which both by Sea and Land I have
endured; in regard of so many Conspiracies and Counterplots which by my
implacable enemies have been contrived, and now more then ever are contrived
against me, I begin wholly to despair and saint.

After this request, the Temple shook, and the earth trembled, when from the
mouth of Apollo's Minister came these words: The Universal Monarchy shall
return anew to the noble Italian Nation, when it shall give over those
intestine discords, which have made it a slave to Strangers. Upon so sad an
answer, the Monarchy of Spain full of grief departed out of the Temple, and
much she marvailed, when she saw the French Monarchy present her self before
her; with whom having used her wonted Complements, she drew her aside, and
declaring unto her, what answer she had received from the Oracle; she
informed her, that if the Universal Monarchy should return again to the
Italian Nation, France would quickly be as sure to feel a new Julius Caesar,
as Spain a second Scipio; and therefore to secure their affairs, there was no
such way, as to divide Italy between them. She also offered to teach her the
same Receipt, which she had so happily experimented in the Indiaes,
wherewithal they might so assure themselves of the Italian Nation, that there
should remain no more of that wicked race of men in the world, then the bare
name. Let me first forget (answered then the French Monarchy) that unlucky
devision of the Kingdom of Naples, which my king Lewis the twelfth made not
long since with you, and then we will talk of this business: For it is not so
easy a matter to wrong the French a second time, as I perceive you persuade
your self it is. As for the receipt, which (to be secured of the Italians) you
propound unto me, I pray you use it your self; for to spoil the earth of
people (as you have done in the Indiaes) and to reign over naked Countries void
of inhabitants, is a certain politic Precept, which is not found in the
French reason of State; for I have learned to my cost to content my self with
a little, so it be good; and therefore I place my greatness more in the
multitude of Subjects, then in the extent of Kingdoms; and so as my French may
live co^modiously in this world, I am well pleased that others shall do so
too. Moreover, with that liberty, which is proper to my nature, I will freely
tell you, that the subduing of all Italy, is not an enterprise so facile as you
imagine; for when I was of your humor, I know how pernicious it proved to me;
and therefore be warned by my experience, not to attempt that, which in the end
will bring you nothing but loss, and disgrace.

CHAP. 7. Almansor, sometime King of the Moors, encountering with the Kingdom
of Naples, they relate one to another the miseries they sustain by the
oppression of the Spaniards.
THe famous King of Moors, Almansor; he that many years together reigned in
Spain over the noble Realm of Granada, met yesterday with the Kingdom of
Naples, and falling in talk with him, after he had for a good space observed
the chain, which the said Kingdom of Naples wore fastened about his leg, he
told him, that the manufacture thereof being Moresco, he verily thought that he
had many times scene, and handled it some where else; and a little while after
with a show of great marvayle he affirmed, that he knew it well; and how it was
the very same, wherewith all both he, and the Moorish Kings his Predecessors
had for the space of seven hundredth years held many Kings of Spain in
servitude; and therefore he earnstely entreated him, to let him understand,
how, by whom, and when he was chayned in that manner. A very good eye, and an
excellent memory have thou, Almansor; (answered then the Kingdom of Naples)
for this unlucky chain, which thou see about my leg, was brought out of
Spain by Gonsalvo Corduba, called the great Captain, and therefore it is very
likely to be the same thou speak of. And now it is an hundredth years, since
first I found my self in the miserable servitude, wherein thou beholdest me,
and from which I know not whither ever I shall be freed; for in regard of the
mighty power, whereunto I see the sorces of the Spaniards arrived, having
utterly lost all hope of assistance, that may be expected from men, I know,
that my ancient liberty stands wholly in the poewrfull hand of God, who had
need to renew in me the miracles of the Red Sea, if my deliverance shall
follow. The years (replied Almansor) confront well; for a little before the
time of thy servitude, the Spaniards undid this my chain from about the leg
of the Kingdom of Granada, where withal afterward they bound thee. But let
it not displease thee, O Kingdom of Naples, to declare unto me, how it could
come to pass, that the Spaniards should make themselves Masters of such a
Kingdom as thou art, so potent, and so far distant from their Forces. By
fraud Almansor, (said the Neapolitan Kingdom) did the Spaniards get into
Italy, for by open force they had never been able to make such notable
acquests; and as thou saydest well, so disproportionable to their Forces, which
were so far off. But hear, and vvonder at the large and gross conscience
of a King of Spain in matters of State, although he used much art to seem
unto foolish men a very Saint; for thou shall come unto the knowledge of a
Tragedy, according to the rules of my Christian Religion, most wicked and
cruel; but according to the terms of modern Policy, the most advised, that
ever any Nation represented upon the Stage of the world. Alfonso my King, to
his utter, and my chiefest ruin, gave Isabella his Niece (for from this
unhappy marriage did my displantation take beginning) to John Galeazzo, Duke of
Milan for wife. The minortie first, and then the unspeakable silly weakness
of so unfortunate a Prince encouraged Lodovico Sforza to usurp the State upon
his Nephew; Alfonso, as it behoved him, sought to hinder that Tyranny; where
of Lodovico being aware, and knowing, that without the ruin of my Kings, it
was not possible for him to arrive unto the end of his most injust desire, he
fell into that resolution, which afterward both to himself, to me, and to
all the Princes of Italy proved so fatal, of drawing the French into Italy, to
the conquest of me. My Kings to defend themselves from such mighty enemies,
called to their aid that holy soul of Ferdinand King of Aragon their Cousin,
who showed himself so kind a kinsman, and such a faithful friend, that in
stead of chasing away the French enemies, he divided me with them; and to show
himself complete, a little after this unhappy division, he entered into wars
against the French, and having overcome them, he forced them to return full of
shame, and loss into their country; vvhereupon the good King Ferdinand
without any scruple at all of conscience became my absolute Lord; and then it
was, that he fastened this chain about my leg, which thou remembrest to be
the manufacture, and work of thy Nation. And I do not think, that in all the
Chronicles of the Saracens, Moors, or Turks, which it is likely thou have
read, there was ever a more wicked treachery recorded, done by a King, that
desired to be reputed a man of a good conscience, and of an holy disposition;
and that a little before had received of the Apostolic Sea that glorious title
of the most Catholic King. Truly (replied Almansor) in the Chronicles, which
thou have named of my Nation, many foul actions committed by diverse Princes
out of ambition to reign, may be read, but this which thou have recounted of
Ferdinand goes beyond them all. But if thou, O Almansor, (said the Kingdom of
Naples) did with thy Nation keep the Kingdom of Granada, chayned so many
hundredth years, what course took the Spaniards for to free him? That Union
of the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon (replied Almansor) which followed upon
the marriage between Ferdinand and Isabella, occasioned the liberty of the
Kingdom of Granada: a most unhappy Union, the which, no less then I have
done, and continually still do, the greatest Potentates of Europe, have
lamented, do lament, and perpetually with unfeigned tears will lament; as
that, which is the true and only root, from whence are sprung all those
greatest subversions of States, which unto this day have been seen in many
parts of Europe, but more remarkeably in Italy. And believe me, Neapolitan
Kingdom, that even till now might I have reigned happily in Spain, if this
pestiferous Union had not overthrowen my greatness; for the many jealousies
that reigned between the Castilians and Aragonians, were my inexpugnable
Cittadels, which would have maintained my reign here for ever. Withal assure
thy self, O Kingdom of Naples, that the aids which the Popes gave to
Ferdinand, and Queen Isabella, greatly accelerated my taking in. Peace, peace,
Almansor (said then the Neapolitan Kingdom) for after thou were chaced out of
Spain by the ambitious Spanish Nation, the Popes vndervvent such miseries,
that it may be truly said, how with ready money they bought those extreme
calamities, wherewithal afterward they encountered; for though the Sea
Apostolical were well contented to see the Moors driven out of Spain, yet
that satisfaction was much dissasted with my servitude, which followed
presently upon it, the Popes having never had any thing in greater fear, then
that I should fall into the hands of a mighty Prince, who might make them live
in those perpetual jealousies, wherein finding themselves drowned even up to
the very eyes, many of them, and particularly those, that have a greater
knowledge of things of the world, do not always make quiet sleeps. A clear
testimony of the truth which I speak, was the lamentable and wicked sack of
Rome, perpetrated by the Spaniards a little after my servitude; with which
ingratitude they paid the Apostolic Sea for all they were debtors unto it,
as well for the remission of the Tribute of Naples, as for the other succors,
which they received in the war of Granada. A calamity, that having past the
terms of most grievous miseries, has in such manner opened the eyes even of
men of the drowsiest understanding, that every one comes clearly to know,
what it is to vnchayne the Lion out of a zeal of piety; for the Spaniards no
sooner saw themselves freed from the impediment of the Moors of Granada, but
that through the ambition, which they showed in desiring to command over the
whole Universe, not only in Italy, but throughout all Europe, most important
jealousies of State, and most grievous interests of Religion discovered
themselves, in so much, that I have often heard it discoursed by men of most
understanding in affairs of the world, how peradventure it would have been
less prejudicial for many Princes of Europe, that thou had reigned still
in Granada, then that the Spaniards should have passed into Italy, to acquire
such important States, as at this day they possess there.

Hereunto may be added the prejudices both public and private, which my ruin
has brought, and continually does bring unto the Italian Princes, and more
particularly to the Popes, because the Kings of Spain had no sooner fastened
this Chain about my leg, but presently they began to aspire unto the
Dominion of all Italy; and the quicklier to arrive thereunto, they knew very
excellently how to interesse themselves in the differences, which at that time
depended between the Princes of Italy, and the French, about the possession of
the Duchy of Milan, wherein that top of man, Charles the fifth, carried
himself in such sort, that he made himself to be known the worthy Nephew
of his Grandfather by the Mothers side: for having with the Forces of the
Italian Princes, chased the French out of Italy, instead of restoring the
Sforzi to the State, as it was agreed betwixt him, and the confederate Princes,
with the fraud of a thousand Turkish quarrels picked of purpose, which he well
knew how to invent against the Sforzi, he made himself absolute Master of that
so important a Duchy. Stay, Kingdom of Naples; and making a point here, (said
Almansor) satisfy me in this: seeing the noble State of Milan was fallen into
the hands of the Spaniards, what hindered them from running precipitously to the
acquisition of all Italy? and seeing thy servitude does manifest unto the
world, that the aids and succors of Princes, serve more for the benefit of
him that gives them, then for the profit of him that receives them, why would
not the Italian Princes rather suffer, that Milan should be under the Dominion
of the French, then by receiving aid from the Spaniards, run the danger of
letting that Duchy, (being so important a member of Italy) fall into the
hands, as thou saydest it did, of the Kings of Spain? The power of the Kings
of France (answered the Neapolitan Kingdom) defends that remnant of Liberty
which remains in Italy, from the ambition of Spain: for those glorious Kings
out of the interest of their greatness will not endure, that the Dominion of
all Italy should fall into the power of the ambitious Spanish Nation, which
cannot extinguish the ardent thirst they have of commanding, neither with the
Conquest of all the new World discovered by them, nor with so great a part
which they possess in the old.

Besides, the Italian Princes, who know the great peril (wherein they find
they are) of a dangerous and miserable servitude, have so united themselves
together, that although they be many in number, yet make they but one Body; and
the Spaniards, who have used, and do use all possible devises to dis-unite
them, evidently perceive, that they wash a Black-Moore.

But touching the State of Milan, thou must know, how it was judged more secure
for the public Liberty of Italy, that that Duchy should fall into the power
of the Spaniards, then that it should remain in the hands of the French; who
for that they were joining to Italy, when therein they should possess any
little part, there would have been manifest danger, that they would have made
themselves absolute Lords of the whole: but in the Spaniards it would fall out
clean contrary; for their Forces, albeit very great, are notwithstanding so
far off, that by so long a tract of sea, they could with much difficulty
transport out of Spain into Italy Forces, that were able to maintain the
acquests they had made, not that they could be sufficient to subdue the whole.

Thou speak the truth, (said then Almansor) but go on, and declare unto me
the prejudices, which thy falling into the hands of the Spaniards brought unto
the Popes. Know then, (replied the Kingdom of Naples) that whereas before, the
Popes were the terror of my Kings, now it happens to be clean otherwise;
for they live in a very great agony, lest the Union of Milan with Naples should
one day follow; to which mark, they observe, the Spaniards have directed the
scope of all their thoughts; vvhereupon the Spaniards, whose proper nature it
is to make good use of the fear, whereinto they see they have put the Princes
their neighbors, have arrogated unto themselves such authority in the Court of
Rome, that they vaunt they are the true arbitrators of all the most important
matters, which there are handled. Moreover, when the Kings of Naples were not
Kings of Spain, the Popes with every little menace of denying the investiture,
obtained of my Kings, Principalities, Dutchyes, Earldomes, and other great
States in gift, buying their friendships also with marriages, and many other
sorts of liberality; but now, the fear being ceased, if the Popes vvil make
their kindred great with titles of important States, they must be glad to buy
them with their ready money, and the advised Kings of Spain, besides the
precious Gold of entreaties, which at any hand they will be sure shall precede
for a first payment, sell them unto them thoroughly sawced. Important
interests, and grievous disorders are these (said Almansor) which thou have
recounted unto me; but how comes it that thou, Kingdom of Naples, which art
the Magazine of Silks, the Granary of Italy, should go so ragged, and be
so lean? Seeing the Spaniards, that come naked out of Spain [answered the
Kingdom of Naples] after they have been three or four days in my house,
will needs cover themselves all over with gold, it is no marvel if I be
spoiled, to clothe so many Raggedemuffins: besides, if thou saw the
rapacitie of the Viceroys, that to recover them selves are sent unto me, or if
thou knew the rapines of Secretaryes, of thousand Officers, and other
Courtiers, which they bring along with them, all thirsty of my blood, thou
would greatly marvayle, how it were possible, I should satiare the raging,
and greedy swallow of so many hunger-starved wretches. As for the little flesh
thou see on my back, the Spaniards affirm, that in the book of a certain
Florentine, who has given rules of the cruel modern Policy, they find
written, that being a Kingdom conquered, after the manner of those horses
which are kept only for races, I ought to be maintained low in the flesh.

I but (said Almansor then) the Milanesi how are they entreated? They also
(replied the Kingdom of Naples) are bathed with the water, wherewithal thou
see me so wet; only this difference is betwixt us, that in Milan are
drops, in my house, floods. The true occasion of the diversity of these
entreatings is the quality of the Lombards dispositions, most unlike to my
Neapolitans: for the Nobility of the State of Milan are naturally
fantastical, free, resolute, and far from that vice so proper to my
Neapolitans, of flattery, and affectation; but so bold and hardy, that they
dare say, how if one only Cremonese spirit had been found amongst my
Neapolitan Barons, it would have hindered that same forced donatiue, that has
brought me to eat Bread and Onyons; the which, although with great words, it
has been often demanded by the Spaniards in Milan, they have been as
resolutely answered, that they should take care to live: Besides, the confining
of the Grisons, of the Duke of Savoy, and Venetians, are the cause, that the
Kings of Spain proceed with more diseretion in Milan: for when the Popes
managed Arms, I my self also was for their occasion greatly respected. But
soft, Almansor, yonder comes my most capital enemy Don Pedro de Toledo,
wherefore I pray thee withdraw a little; for at any hand I would not have him
take notice, that I lament my disgraces here with thee; and for this only,
were it for nothing else, may I term my servitude most wretched, in that I am
forced to call this miserable state, wherein thou see me, the happy golden
Age.

CHAP. 8. Sigismund Battor learneth the Latin tongue.
YEsterday about eight of the clock in the evening, the ordinary Post of
Germany arrived at this Court, and brought very joyful news, how Sigismund
Battor, Prince of Transylvania, was grown so inamored of the graceful Latin
tongue, that to his great glory he spoke, and wrote with the purity and
eloquence of the Cesarean style; whereupon all the Virtuous earnestly besought
Apollo, that for such good news there might be made in Pernassus all those
demonstrations of joy, which (to encourage Great-men to the love of Learning)
were wont to be made, when any Prince became learned: But his Majesty, that
sees into the uttermost secret of all things, denied those Virtuous their
request, and told them, that then only there should be feasting in Pernassus,
when out of the freeness of a noble mind, and mere election of studies, not
constrained by any necessity, Princes applied themselves to Learning; and that
they were to know, how Prince Battor had gotten the elegant Latin tongue,
neither out of ambition to show himself to be learned, nor out of a virtuous
curiosity to know many things, but only out of necessity for his reputations
sake, to correct the foolish and childish absurdity which he committed, in
Gender, Number and Case, at such time, as in the war of Hungary he took that
fatal resolution to arm himself against the Turk, for to adhere unto the
Emperor of Germany, whom in regard of the strong and lively pretensions, which
he has to the Principali^y of Transylvania, he was to have in more horror,
then seventy Ottoman Emperors.

CHAP. 9. The Cardinal of Toledoes Summa is not admitted into the Library of
Pernassus.
THe illustrious, and reverend Francesco Cordova, Cardinal of Toledo, a
personage of exemplarie life, an exquisite Divine, and excellent Philosopher;
he that in his own person honored the Word of God in the Pulpit more then
any other Preacher whatsoever of his time, some few days since arrived at
Pernassus, having been received upon the confines of the State, by Alessandro
d' Ales, and Cornelio Musso Bishop of Bitonto, and all the way entertained at
his Majesty's charge. This honorable learned man presented his Writings unto
the venerable College of the Virtuous; and those of Philosophy were not only
commended, but admired; as also the Commentaries composed by him upon the
divine passages of all the sacred Writers, were received with extraordinary
applause, and shortly after they were carried in a precious Vrne under a cloth
of Estate, into the Delphicke Library, and with the name of the Author
consecrated to Eternity. Only his Summa, although very learned, was not
received by those Virtuous, who freely told him, that there were so many Works
already of that kind in his Majesty's Library, as some of them seemed
superfluous: for an infinite many of great Divines had with such diligence
handled matters appertayning to the consciences of private men, that they had
put the salvation of souls into comprimise, for the only regard of a shillings
gain: And that the world very much desired to see a complete Summa, composed
upon the consciences of great Princes; a matter most necessary for the quiet of
the whole Universe, and altogether omitted by Divines; wherein those actions of
Princes should be exactly discoursed upon, with which so often they put the
world into confusion, filling it with robberies, assassinates, and such
flaughters of men, that many of them blinded with the ambition to reign upon
earth, have made rivers to run with humane blood.

The College of the Learned, hearing these particulars, said, That they much
desired to have these Questions disputed, and resolved: Namely, whether
Christian piety will admit the special hipothesis, which the violence of the
sword has usurped over others States: Whether a Principality, that by Arms,
and fraud, is forceably taken from another Prince, may be held by one that has
the true fear of God: Whether that course of ruling a Kingdom, which is
conquered only to the end to impoverish and waste it, that so it may be
governed without jealousy, may be practiced by one that is borne in the
Christian Faith: Whether the exalting of Reason of State to such an height,
that it should trample under feet, as at this present it does, all Laws divine
and humane, be not a more detestable and execrable Idolatry, then worshipping
Nabuchadnezzars Image, or the golden Calfe. And lastly, the College said, That
then their desires would be fully accomplished, when there could be found a
Divine so much fearing God, that with his Writings durst fright Princes as much
from doing evil, as many others with their great Volumes had terrified private
men; for it seemed a strange thing unto them, that infinite learned Divines had
so labored to reason of the strict account, which Shopkeepers are to render,
even for idle words, unto the Majesty of God, and in the mean time had
omitted to make mention of those exorbitant errors, committed by great Princes;
when with their Armies overrunning States, they send all things into
perdition, both sacred and profane: And that with more benefit to mankind,
and eternal reward to themselves, Divines might have discoursed upon the
actions of Lewis the twelfth, and Frances the first, both Kings of France; of
Ferdinand King of Aragon, and Charles the fifth the Emperor, whose souls
departed out of this world with the heavy burden of half a million of
manslaughters, all committed by their ambition to reign, and whereof they were
to give a strict account to Almighty God: All which were matters exceeding
necessary, to the end, that mankind so much afflicted by the ambition of
Princes, might one day receive the consolation, which with such longing it
desires, when those that reign, should be terrified from doing amiss, and be
made to know, that Hell was prepared as well for the Great, as the small.

CHAP. 10. The French desire the Receipt of the Spanish Sent for Gloves.
THe emulation which is seen to reign between the two warlike and powerful
French and Spanish Nations, is as great, as it is eternal: for there is not
any virtue appearing in the French, which is not exceedingly coveted by the
Spaniards; neither are the French ever quiet, till they have attained unto
those rarities, wherwithal they see Spain endued. And because that sent with
which Gloves are made so sweet, is a particular invention and gift of the
Spaniards, the French have omitted nothing that might bring them to the
perfection of making the like; and to their great charge they furnished
themselves with Musk, Ambergriece, Civet, and all other the most odoriferous
Drugges the East produces, but all to no purpose; for neither charge, nor
diligence were sufficient to make them attain to the end of their intent;
howbeit, before they would give it over as desperate, the noble French Nation
had recourse unto his Majesty, the productour of all Aromatickes, whom they
earnestly besought that he would be pleased to teach the French the way how
to make the right Spanish sent for sweet Gloves. Whereupon Apollo was never
seen to laugh more heartily at the fall of the unfortunate Icarus, then he
did at the request of those French, whose hands, he commanded his Priests that
stood by him, to smell unto, and tell him what they sented of: The Priests
immediately obeyed, and affirmed unto his Majesty, that they sented well:
Which Apollo hearing, he said to those French, that nature always used to
countervaile a defect with some rare virtue; and that therefore the gift of
making Gloves so sweet, she had only granted to that Nation, whose hands
stunke most abominable.

CHAP. 11. The Monarchy of Spain throvveth her Physician out of the window.
THis morning the Monarchy of Spain having sent for her ordinary Physician, a
little after with her own hands she threw him out of the window of her Royal
Palace, whereupon the poor wretch, being all battered in pieces, died
incontinently. An accident that seemed the more strange, in regard the
Physician was held by all the Court to be a man of extraordinary honesty, and
in the practice of his profession most admirable. Sundry were the discourses,
that were made upon so remarkable a matter. But Apollo desiring to know of the
Spanish Monarchy her self the true cause of so grievous a resentment, that
mighty Queen told him, how above forty years since, upon occasion of some
accidents that befell her, and other signs, which she had discovered, she
feared that in process of time, she should catch some dangerous French disease
from the Royal House of Burbon, and therefore; to provide for the
inconvenience which she foresaw, she had demanded counsel of her Physician,
who prescribed her a long, fashidious, and chargeable purgation, compounded of
diverse Oils of Holy Leagues, of insurrections of people, of rebellions of
Nobility, of Cauteries, and other very bitter ingredients, whereby she had
spoiled her stomach, weakened her strength, and altogether lost her appetite;
and that the infinite quantity of Syrrupes, and the many medicines which she
had taken with such anguish, had wrought no other effect, but the accelleration
of the disease, which without that unlucky and unseasonable purgation
peradventure she should never have had: Moreover, that the many Leaches which
were applied to many parts of her body, had in such manner sucked the best
vital blood of the Gold of that Spain, that thorough the weakness of her
complexion, she was not able to euacuate those evil humors of Flanders, which
had held her, and do hold her oppressed. By which disorders, all occasioned
through the naughty counsel of that imprudent Physician, she was so
exasperated against him, that she had solemnly sworn to throw him out of the
window, if to free her from future infirmities, he ever after ordained her any
purgation; And that perceiving, how the pain which she has at this instant in
the shoulder of Holland, was an apparent Lues Gallica, she had demanded
counsel of the same Physician for to clear her self of it; who unmindful of
his former errors, had foolishly ordained the second purgation, wholly and
altogether like the former, and that therefore being overcome with pain, she
had thrown him out of the Window; so punishing him at once for both the faults
he had committed: for it seemed unto her, that he had well deserved the
misfortune of that resentment, seeing that by the accidents following, with
such infelicitie of her Spaniards, he had not learned to know, that purgations
made before their time for diseases that are feared, do not work those good
effects, which either the Physician believes, or the Patient desires.

CHAP. 12. Most of the States of the World are censured in Pernassus for their
errors.
APollo careful of nothing more, then to see that the Princes of the World,
should in the upright government of their States, give the people such
satisfaction as they ought, introduced into Pernassus (many ages since) this
admirable Custom: That every year, the names of the chiefest Potentates of
the earth, written upon little schedules, should be put into an Vrne, and then
being drawn forth one by one, the public Censor of Political matters
should (in the presence of the sacred College of the Learned) record the
disorders, which he had observed in the government of their States; whereupon
those Princes were bound either incontinently with satisfying reasons to defend
such things as were objected against them, or else within a Month to reform
them.

An institution no doubt very noble, and holy; for it has effected, that in
the progress of so many ages, since first it was used, Princes have corrected
an infinity of errors: besides, knowing that they are to be called to so
strict an account, it makes them endeavor to live so virtuously, that in the
presence of so many Princes they need not to blush. Upon the day appointed
then, most of the Potentates of the World appeared before Apollo: And Count
Baldazar Castiglione the Political Censor, said unto the reverend Lord
Giouanni dalla Casa, Nuntio for the Sea Apostolical in this State, which was
first drawn out of the Vrne; That it seemed unto him a most scandalous matter,
and indeed unworthy the Greatness, and Majesty of the Popes, that in Rome
should be seen some potent Families, unto whom it served in stead of a rich
patrimony to be dependant on foreign Princes, not very well affected to the
greatness of the Apostolic Sea, which in every occasion were apt with the
power of their Factions to give the Popes much trouble; And that he might truly
say, how in all his time he had not seen a more foul and execrable thing,
then that which the Emperor Charles the fifth did, when with the noble Charge
of the Kingdom of Naples he rewarded the cruel seditions, and shameful
treacheries, which the Cardinal Pompeo Colonna used against the High Bishop
Clement the seventh. Then the Lord Giouanni demanded of the Count, how long it
was, since he had conuersed in the Roman Court; who answering, Some seventy
years past: the Nuntio replied, that returning thither now, he should find,
how by reason of the abundance of vertjuice, which the Pompei, Pabritij,
Prosperi, Ascanij of the family of Colonna; the Virginij, and other more
principal Barons of the House of Orsina had eaten; the teeth of their
Nephews, and Grandchildren were so set on edge, that they could hardly chaw
there broth: for the Popes which had tied those exorbitances about their
fingers, knew so excellently how to practice the Tarquinian precept, that they
have reduced those Poppies, which heretofore were as high as Cedars, to the
humble stature of ridiculous dwarffes.

This answer satisfied the Count, who turning to the Roman Empire, next
diawen out of the Vrne, he said unto him, That the present disorders, which
were seen not only in the great patrimony of the House of Austria, but in all
Germany, proceeded from the negligence of the present Emperor Rodolphus, and
therefore he much desired, that that Majesty would with more care embrace the
government of his so many States; remembering, that Princes, rulers of mankind,
bore upon their shoulders the heauiest weight, and had in their hands the most
laborious work, that any the painefullest day-labourer whatsoever could
exercise. The Censor was exceedingly thanked by the Roman Empire for this
advise; whereunto with much gravity he answered, That it was a disgrace common
with all Princes, to be accused of negligence, when scandals arose in their
States, although it notoriously appeared, that in regard they were occasioned
by the practices of more mighty enemies, they could not possibly be avoided by
an understanding Prince.

Wherefore it was to be considered, That the monstrous felicities, which the
most mighty House of Austria have had by inheriting with their Matches, the
States of Flanders, the Kingdoms of Spain, of Naples, Sicilia, Bohemia,
Hungary, and Portugal, have given all the Princes of Germany, of Italy, and
of Europe such diabolical jealousies, that they have caused both the passed
and present ruins, now beheld in their ancient patrimony: Whereunto the
Emperors, which have reigned since Maximilian the first of famous memory,
albeit they were reputed most valorous and prudent princes, could never after
apply any salve, that did not infinitely exasperate the sore of the disorders
of Germany, wherein had concurred such abundance of malignant humors, that it
might truly be said, it was immedicable. Further, it was to be remembered, what
small authority, the modern Emperors have had in Germany, so that it were not
only a discurtesie, but open injustice to will one, that has his hands fast
bound behind him, to perform the acts of Orlando. Moreover, the quality of
the Empire was to be regarded, which being elective, they that served, had more
authority in it, then they that commanded. Besides, the present weakness of the
House of Austria in Germany, from whom (with the seditions of Religion) the
hearts of their subjects are stolen; a theft so important, that they may well
abandon those States as lost, wherein such dangerous seed is sown. Whereupon
the present Emperor seeing himself deprived of the obedience of his subjects,
desires every one to reflect upon the quality of the Cousins, which the House
of Austria has in Spain, and they shall find, that the people of Almaine
borne for their liberty, to secure themselves from the monstrous power of such
a Family, take impious and wrongful reuenges even on those, which shall not be
free from the servitude of the Spaniards, if for the sins of men they ever
arrive to that point of commanding over the World; from which (by the mere
goodness and mercy of God they are put off as far, as by their many devises
they have labored to come near it. That also it was to be thought upon, how
the first that in Italy, and abroad, disinherited with all kind of irreuerence,
and disrespect the Majesty of the Empire, were those their Cousins of Spain,
as clearly appeared by the usurpation of Finale, and other Imperial feudes by
them possessed. All which things, moving dangerous humors without dissolving
them afterward, do cause the House of Austria in Germany, to be cruelly
scourged by most powerful enemies, whilst the Spaniards with their only
menaces seek to put the whole world into suspicion and distaste. And for
conclusion, he desired all the sacred College to consider, that to the
miserable sterilitie of children, which is seen in the present Emperor, is
adjoined a lamentable fertility of brethren; one of which incited by the most
violent spur of ambition, has not doubted at last to go about to overthrow
his own House, which is ready to fall. All accidents so unhappy, that they
would make even Solomon himself seem to the World a very fool.

These replies, which to all the Assistants seemed very weighty, satisfied the
Censor, who turning him to the warlike French Monarchy, said unto her, How
all the Virtuous of Pernassus much desired of her, that she would rule the
furious, unquiet, capricious, and exceeding impetuous dispositions of her
French, reducing them to those terms of prudence, advisednesse, and
stayednesse of mind, which are seen in the noble Italian, and Spanish
Nations; and how it much blemished her reputation, that the Kingdom of France,
which holds a first place amongst the most principal Monarchies of the
World, should be inhabited by men so infinitely rash. To this aduert sement the
French Monarchy replied, That the Censor not well informed of the interests of
her Kingdom, had censured for defects the chiefest virtues, which she loved
in her French. Folly, lightness, unadvisedness, and a precipitous nature were
they, which had made her so feared, and formidable a Queen, because her French
with unspeakable alacrity and forwardness, would upon the least nodde of
hers, expose themselves to those perils, whereunto other Princes could not with
the rope, the cudgel, and the cruellest kinds of punishment compel their
wise, advised, and circumspect subjects: And that in the many wars, which she
had held with most valorous Nations, she had learned to know, how an army
framed of soldiers, which had little brain, and much courage, so that they are
led by a valiant, and discreet General, does carry away the victory from
those people, who profess more circumspection, and wisdom. This answer of
the Monarchy of France, was so much the more commended of Castiglione, by how
much, regarding the quality of a mighty Kingdom, he knew that the French
possessed all those endowments and virtues, which were requisite in a Nation,
for to found, amplify, and maintain a great Empire.

Then the Censor turning to the powerful Monarchy of Spain, said unto her,
how it was evident, nothing gave greater satisfaction to all people in
general, but more particularly to those which were subject to strange Nations,
then the humanity, and affable carriage of such as governed them; whereas she
sending to the governments of Naples, Milan, and Sicilia, none but her own
Spaniards, they with their ordinary Castilian stateliness, and insupportable
Spanish pride, without all comparison far exceeding that, which the Kings of
Spain themselves either could, or would have used in those States, did so
exasperate even their good and faithful subjects, that the Spanish Dominion
was grown infinitely odious: And that further, both in weighty, and slight
affairs he desired more quick expeditions from her, seeing that by her too
much delay, and perplexity in the deliberation of important matters, she had
lost many fair occasions, that had presented themselves unto her, for the
enlarging of her Empire. The Monarchy of Spain, very much thanked the Censor
for the advertisements he had given her, and in her excuse answered, how that
honorable Gentleman, which had a young wife, beyond all expression fair, but
of a disposition enclyned to lasciviousness, should show himself very
discreet, if he desired, that a proper handsome servant, whom he kept in his
house, should be rather extremely hated, then any whit affected by his wife:
and that unto the delay in the resolution of her affairs, which she knew to be
virious and prejudicial, it lay not in her power to give remedy: for almighty
God having not without important occasions created her Spaniards wholly, and
altogether quite different in disposition from the French, whilst they in the
deliberation of businesses were rather precipitous, then executive, she in her
being so slow, and irresolute, obeyed the will of God, who would have it so.

The next drawn out of the Vrne was the Monarchy of Poland; unto whom Count
Baldasar said, How all the Princes of Europe could have wished, that the
present King Sigismond had used toward those seditious Nobles, which last
rebelled against him, some severitie worthy so grievous a fault, only to the
end, that by their example, other Lords might have been deterred from
committing the like. To this the Polach Monarchy answered, That those
chastisements given to the Nobility, which in an hereditarie State would be
commodious, have always prooved in her elective Kingdom prejudicial: And how
that Kingdom, which another receives in gift from a Nobility, in whose power
is the election of the King, cannot without evident peril of falling from his
greatness, be governed with that rigor, which in other hereditarie States is
necessary; for that Senate, which out of an election of love gives another a
Kingdom, if it be provoked by the powerful passion of hate, knows also how
to reassume it, in regard welladvised Senators are wont to reserve unto
themselves those necessary instruments, whereby upon every occasion of evil
satisfaction, they may recall their used liberality: And that the present King
Sigismond being the first of his House, which had reigned in Poland, he was
to direct the aim of all his thoughts to no other scope so much, as by an
extraordinary indulgence to win the hearts of the Nobility of his State,
that so with a grateful memory of his clemency, he might perpetuate the
succession of such a Kingdom in his Blood. An advertisement, most necessary
for Sigismond his King, by reason the Polachs, although their King be elective,
do never defraud the Royal Blood of the succession, if he that reigns, can
tell how to get the general love of the Nobility. For the Polonians being a
Nation, that know not how to live in an absolute liberty, do so abhor all
manner of servitude, that that King among them (a matter common to all elective
Princes) shall be most oculatiue, and vigilant in the matters of his State, that
least seems either to see or know any thing. Not only the Censor, but the
whole College of the Virtuous, admitted the justification of the Polach
Monarchy for excellent.

Hereupon, the Count turning hemselfe to the vast Ottoman Empire, said unto
him, That the cruelty, which he used, only upon light suspicions, against his
chiefest ministers, was held by all the world to be a bloody course; it being
a received opinion, that men of extraordinary valor and merit, should not be
laid hands on, but for great and prooved offenses: And that when the Ottoman
Princes did even justly take away the lives of their ministers, the custom of
seizing upon their Estates to their own use, and thereof utterly depriving the
children, did scandalize all good justice, because it seemed, that with such
cruel rigor, the Estates, rather then the faults of the delinquents, were
hunted after. To this so open a correction, the Ottoman Empire answered with
admirable gravity, That he was grown to that greatness wherein he was
seen, by the only two most powerful means of reward without measure, and
punishment without end: And that the sole foundation of he quiet of every
State, being placed in the fidelity of the most important ministers, Princes
were not to seek any thing with more care, then with immense rewards to allure
them unto faithfulness, and with infinite punishments to terrify them from
trecheries: That those ministers which have in their power the Forces,
Command, and Governments of States, not being able to er^e, but in most
important matters, it were the counsel of a foolish Prince, upon suspicions
of that moment to arraigne, accuse, and hear the justifications of the
offender; but in such a case, the Prince which will run no danger, ought to
endeavor to surprise his minister upon the sudden, and to deal so securely,
that the execution of the punishment may precede even the accusation itself:
That many times it had fallen out, that he with a sudden chastisement had
prevented the consummation of most foul treasons: Which resolution, though he
acknowledged to be most severe, yet he knew it had so wrought, that there were
never seen in his State any Counts St Paul, Princes of Orange, Dukes of Guise,
d' Aumale, du Maine, de Mercure, and other foul monsters of disloyalty,
which, with the shame of those Princes, that with halters, poynards, and
axes knew not how to prevent such dangerous offenses, have been seen
otherwhere: It being a rule in matters of State as common, as secure, That that
minister, which gives to his Prince the least shadow of suspicion of his
faith, incurreth a capital pain, because those Captains which have the care
of Armies in their power, are bound, like the wives of Honorable personages, to
live with such purity of mind, that they be free not only from blame, but
from the least suspicion of a blameworthy thought. That touching the seazure
of his Basshawes estates after their death, he thought he might truly say, that
the entertainements, gifts, and wealth, wherewithal other Princes rewarded
their ministers, in comparison of those inexhaustible riches which he bestowed
on his well-deseruing Officers, were vile, and poor, as those Royal
Treasures, which Ruften, Mahomet, Ibrahin, and infinite others left behind
them after their decease, have fully testified: That the greatest regard, which
a Prince ought to have in rewarding his ministers, consists in providing,
that the unmeasurable riches, wherewith he bought of them infinite fidelity,
may not possibly at any time be converted to the prejudice of him, that used
the liberality: That from the grievous disorders fallen out in the States of
other Potentates he had found it to be a matter most pernicious unto Princes,
that the extraordinary riches left by a deserving minister should pass unto
his children, not having first deserved it (by their virtue, valor, and
fathers said fidelity) of the Prince: That he had not out of covetousness, as
many misjudged, confiscated the great inheritances of his Basshawes, but that
by the commodity thereof, those subjects should not be idle, and consequently
vicious, which being descended of fathers of notable valor, gave the Prince
assured hope they would imitate the virtues of their Progenitors: That the gate
of his Treasure stood perpetually open to the heirs of his ministers, to
restore them their fathers enheritances twice doubled, when they with their
fidelity, and valor should deserve them; and how much the riches of men
vicious, and subject to ambition were apt to disturb the peace of any Kingdom
how great soever, well appeared by the fresh examples, which he had seen both
in France and Flanders.

Whilst the Ottoman Empire spoke in this manner, he observed that the renowned
French Monarchy with the shaking of her head, seemed to declare, that she no
way approved those reasons, whereupon somewhat the more moved, he said thus:
Mighty Queen, my custom in seizing upon the estates of my Basshawes, is
profitable for the greatness, and quiet of my State; and in regard of the
friendship that is betwixt us, I would to God, the same course were observed in
your France; for you know full well, to what use Henry the Duke of Guize
converted the exceeding riches, wherewithal the liberal Kings Francis the
first, and Henry the second rewarded the merits of Duke Francis his father.
You, and I, and all those that reign do know, how the sweetest bayte that can
allure men, is a Crown, and there being no man, which for to taste never so
little of it, but would hold it a great pleasure for to expose even his life to
manifest danger of losing it, Princes ought to be most vigilant in keeping with
extremest severitie the passages thereunto closed up against all men: nay,
they ought to accomodate their aff^^^es in such sort, that no private man
whatsouer should once hope to taste of so sweet a thing: And I tell you freely,
that if your Duke of Guize had in my State but only thought that, which with
such public scandal he boldly put in execution in your Kingdom of France, I
would the very first day have given him that blow, whereunto your King Henry the
third, although he were incited unto it by the greater part of the Princes of
Italy, could never be drawn, until the very last hour of his shameful
disgraces, and even at that instant, when the sore of the French vprores was
become an incurable ulcer; for where ambition reigns among Nobles, Princes
are constrained to show themselves all severitie, continually keeping scaffalds
in readiness, and prepared, to punish the seditious, and rebellious; and their
Treasury open, to reward the quiet, and the loyal; that Prince being unworthy
to command, that has not the understanding how to make himself be obeyed;
neither can there be a more scandalous matter seen, or met withal in a State,
then that the Prince should live in jealousy of an Officer, which ought to
tremble before him. But it is the property of you the Princes of Christendom,
making profession of Learning, and directing your selves by rules of Policy,
to call me Barbarous, and my secure way of proceeding, Tyrannical, whilst in
the mean time ye suffer your selves to be reduced by your heroical virtues
of clemency, and gentleness, to shameful terms of enduring unworthy things.

It is not possible to deliver, how much the Ottoman Empire offended all the
Virtuous of the sacred College with his discourse, who standing up, told him
in great disdain, how they could prove with present reasons, that all which
he had said, were most wicked conceits, unworthy to be spoken by any person
that had a soul, or to be heard of men, that made profession of honor.
Whereunto the Ottoman Empire answered smiling, That others in the government of
Kingdoms might have regard to Virtue, and I know not what, but for his part he
would never be persuaded, but that the quiet and peace of States ought to be
preferred before all other humane interests whatsoever.

Then the Censor, to cut off so odious a dispute, turning to the great Duchy
of Moscovy, said unto him, That the most noble prerogative of reigning over
people, which were lovers of Learning, and excellently Virtuous, was the
second amongst the greatnesses of a Prince: Whereas he by so endeavoring to
bring up his subjects in a gross ignorance, reaped no small blame, if not much
disreputation; because every one skorned him, for that, expelling the famous
liberal Arts out of his State, he had only permitted his people to learn the
benefit of vvriting and reading. To this Censure the Duchy of Moscovy
answered, That the dreadful fire, which he had observed, Learning had ever
kindled in those States, where it had been admitted, had made him resolve not
to suffer in any sort, that so scandalous a a Cockle should be sowed in his
Duchy; for men being the herds of Princes, as sheep the flocks of private
persons, it were extreme folly to arm those gentle sheep their subjects
with the malice, which Learning engrafteth into their dispositions, that
attain unto it; whereas otherwise, in regard of that harmless simplicity,
wherewith Almighty God has creared them, they may be comodiously ruled and
governed, be they never so many in number, by one Prince alone: And how he held
for infallible truth, that if the Germans, and Hollanders had been maintained
by their Princes in the simplicity of their ancient ignorance, and withal it
had been prohibited, that the pure mind of those Nations might not have been
contaminated with the plague of Greek and Latin learning, without all doubt
they had never had the judgment, with such a ruin of their old religion, and
destruction of many Princes, that before ruled over those Provinces, to know
how to frame those perfect forms of Commonweales in their Countries, whereunto
neither the wit of Solon, the wisdom of Plato, nor all the Philosophy of
Aristotle could ever arrive.

This answer so moved the Censor, and all the sacred College of the Learned,
that with threatening looks they said, how the reasons alleged by the Great
Duchy of Moscouy, were open blasphemies; and it seemed the Learned were ready
to make good their words with deeds, when the greater part of the mightiest
Monarchies were seen to betake themselves to their weapons, for defense of
the Moscouite; who growing more audacious upon the forward assistance of so
many Potentates, boldly said, If any one would deny, that Learning did not
infinitely disturb the quiet, and good government of States; and that a Prince
might not with more facility rule a million of ignorants, then an hundredth
learned, that were made to command, and not to obey, he lied in his throat.
The Virtuous upon this daring defiance grew extremely incensed, and stoutly
replied, That the Moscovite had spoken with an insolence, worthy of an
ignorant, and how they could also prove unto him, that men without Learning
were asses and calves with two legs.

Now were they almost ready to go together by the ears, when the Censor cried
out, Forbear, and carry due respect to this place, where we are assembled to
amend disorders, and not to commit scandals; vvhereupon such was the reverence
every one bare to the Majesty of the Censor, that both the Princes, and the
Learned, although they were transported with anger and disdain, became
suddenly pacified.

All being quiet, then the Censor said unto the famous Venetian Liberty, which
next was drawn out of the Vrne, That the hardest matter to be found in an
Aristocracie, as she well knew, was to restrain the young Nobility, who with
their licentiousness distasting the better sort of Citizens, had many times
occasioned the ruin of most famous Commonweales; And that he to his great
grief had heard, how the young Nobility of Venice with their proud demeanor
had offended many honorable Citizens of that State; who exceedingly complained,
that whilst the insolency of the Nobility increased, the chastisements for it
decreased; And that therefore he remembered her, that it was a dangerous point
in an Aristocracie, when those which were to glory for that they were far
from those dangers, whereunto such are subject, as are to obey the humor of a
Prince, be heard to complain, that they are oppressed by many Tyrants.
Hereunto the Venetian Liberty answered, That the disorder recounted by the
Censor was true, and vvithall dangerous; but that the authority of
commanding, was so annexed to pride and insolency, that they seemed to be
borne both at one birth: And that the licentiousness, which the Nobility of
all Aristocracies uses toward the Citizens, was by all the greatest men,
that have discoursed of Commonweales, reputed a desperate cure; for although it
was most necessary, that insolences should be restrained with severe pains,
yet on the other side, an Aristocracie was to abstain as much as possibly
might be from public punishments of Noble men, albeit seditious; to the end
that their shameful suffering might not be an occasion to disinherit the
whole Nobility it self of that respect which is due to them from the
people; for having the government of the State in their hands, the interest of
the public conservation thereof requires, that they be held in highest
reputation: And although in her Venice, disobedient, and insolent Noblemen
were not seen to be so often punished, between the two pillars in the Piazza
of St. Mark, as it seems many desired, yet by the great Council, the
Pregadi, the College, and other supremer Magistrates, that dispense the
public Charges, those seditious Noblemen, which were discovered to carry a
tyrannical, mind, were cruelly afflicted with the torment of shameful
repulses: And that many subjects of most noble Houses are seen in Venice,
whose ancient reputation for their demerits was maimed by Arquebuses charged
with bullets of paper; and that being stricken down with such kind of
shot, they could never rise since to honors and dignities; things wherein
consists the life of the Noblemen of an Aristocracie: And that to excruciate
a body, a greater torture could not be devised, no not by Perillus himself,
then that which once a Nobleman of Venice experienced, when in a concurrence
of the Honorablest Charges, he saw one younger then himself pass before him,
only because he was known to the Senate to be more deserving. Castiglione did
not only admit the justification of the Venctian Liberty, but also did
infinitely commend the circumspection, and severitie, which she used in
punishing her Nobility upon occasion of any demerit, or defect.

Then the Censor said unto the Duchy of Savoy, That his State being seated in
the Confines of France and Italy, he was necessited with all carfulness to
maintain himself neutrall between those Princes, with whom he confined; but
in those last rumors of France, by discovering himself openly to be wholly
Spanish, he had put, not only his own, but the States of all the Princes of
Italy in great trouble: And that whilst with the bellows of his forces he
blew the fire of the French vprores, kindled by the Spaniards ambition, he
ought to believe, that that flame was to burn up friends and kin^ed, before
ever it could get to the other Italian Potentates that were enemies. The
Duchy of Savoy answered the Censor very readily, That the adherence of his
last Duke to the Spaniards, was true, but the fair occasion he had of three
seuens in his hand, even forced him to set up his rest, hoping to encounter the
most famous Primiera, that ever any other Prince whatsoever had at Cards; to
which venture he was the rather carried, because he was assored he could
lose but that money, which at that game he had won before: That afterward,
though by his ill luck the fourth Card, which was dealt him, proved to be a
Coa^e of affront, wherewith he had made the vvorst hit, that could be
encountered on the whole pack of Cards, nevertheless he knew, that the brauest
minds would confess, that albeit the resolution was very dangerous, yet not
to vvrong the Cards, they would have played no otherwise themselves. The
Censor apprehending the Metaphor, very much commended the magnanimous
resolution of that Duke; who, for that he might from a small fever have
received in gift the Empire of the greater part of the World, not only without
any note of imprudence, but to his infinite glory, at such time as so
resolutely he cast the Dye of all the greatness of his fortune upon the table
of Chance, he might well speak those famous words anew, Or Caesar, or nothing.

Then the Censor turned him to the noble Great Duchy of Toscan, and sharply
reprehending him, for going with his Galleys, at it were provoking of Waspes,
he recorded unto him, the misery and calamities, which the Kinghts of St.
John suffered at Rhodes, at Tripoli, and the great danger, that lastly they
ran at Malta, only because they would imprudently have tied squibbes to the
Bulls tail; And that every wise Christian Prince ought rather to favor the
present carelesnese of the Turks, then to waken them with injuries of little
profit; nay, such as brought others much damage, and necessite them to apply
their minds anew unto maritime affairs, which in these times they had even
abandoned: Also he remembered him, how infinite people daily complained, for
that, by his hindering Italy of the trade of the commodities of the Levant, all
Drugges, that came from beyond the Seas, were grown to an excessive rate. To
this correction the great Duchy of Toscan answered, That the power of a Prince
could not be termed perfect, which with a number of armed Vessels had not some
Dominion on the Sea: And that his Galleys were not only very necessary for the
Toscan greatness, but also for the security of the Liberty of all Italy, as
scruing for a School of Mariners, for a Seminary of Captains, and soldiers
at Sea: That he confessed the damage, which they did to the trade of
merchandise, but vvithall, he desired it might be considered, that the mystery
of War, either by Land, or Sea, could not be learned by soldiers, nor
exercised by Princes without prejudice to others: And that Toscan breeding much
filthiness of fantastical unquiet brains, and extravagant humors, he had
therefore great occasion for those Galleys, that might serve, as it were, to
carry forth all the filth of his State, and thereby keep it clean, employing
such only for gally-slaues in them, as had done evil before, and that in
regard of their unquiet nature, were like to do worse after.

This excuse of the Great Duchy of Toscan was approved both by the Censor,
and all the sacred College. Whereupon the Count said unto the Liberty of
Genoua, who was last drawn out of the Vrne, That the excessive use of
exchanges, which she permitted unto her Nobility, caused that great disorder
of enriching the private, and vvithall of empouerishing the public, whose
revennues would have risen to huge sums of Gold, if the real riches of her
Nobility had been employed in a just trade of merchandise.

The Genouese Liberty with a readiness, that gave a particular gust to all
the Learned, answered, How it was true, that exchanges do work that effect,
which the Censor had mentioned, and therefore were most pernicious in any
Monarchy whatsoever; howbeit that notwithstanding they might be permitted in a
well-ordered Commonwealth without any prejudice of the public interests;
because the richest, and securest Treasures of a free State, are the riches of
the Nobility, and Citizens together; a matter, which falls not out in a
Monarchy, where between the commings in of the Prince, and the means of
private men, there runs a long wall of eight stories high built by Mine, and
Thine: Further, that in a Monarchy the mutation of the State commonly follows
with little, or no prejudice to the people, only changing the name of Matthew,
to that of Martin; but in the subversions of Commonweales, where liberty is
changed into servitude, there the proper substance of private men is the
public treasure; for then will they profusely spend all that ever they have,
for to defend their own liberty even to the last gasp.

CHAP. 11. The Duke of Guise his Secretary is punished for speaking amiss.
SOme two days since my Lo: of Guise his Secretary, talking with certain
French Barons, about the passed tumults of France, in making mention of his
Masters party, he called it the holy League, which being reported to his
Majesty, he presently commanded the Strappado to be given him thrice in
public, and then willed him to be told, that for the time to come he should
learn how to speak, when he named a diabolical Rebellion.

CHAP. 14. Certain Persons for example unto others, are showed unto the People
APollo, with much displeasure, came to know, how the greater part of modern
Princes, to prevail over their enemies, do not according to the manner of the
ancient Heroes, use open force of Arms, but (for the most part) fraud; in the
practice whereof they are so understanding, that with that only powerful
mean they have brought to pass most important enterprises; whence it is,
that the first vveapon, which they employ against their enemies is that same
shameful corrupting the faith of their male-contented subjects, and stirring
up the Nobility to rebellion. To remedy then such grievous disorders, about
thirty years past his Majesty commanded, that the unfortunate Count St.
Paul, the Prince of Orange, and the Duke of Guize should be closely carried in
a Caroch by Gio: Francesco Lottini, the secret Register of Moral precepts in
this Court, unto the porch of the Delphicke Temple; where those three great
Princes, with their hands, without fingers, and all so foully torn, as if
they had been gnawen with dogs, were showed by Lottini to the people,
which came in and out at the Temple; unto whom with a loud voice he said:
Ye faithful Virtuous, devoted unto Learning, and holy Moral precepts, by
this so miserable calamity of these unhappy Princes, deprived of the use of
their hands, which God preserve unto you, take example, and learn what it is
for a man to suffer himself to be carried to such simplicity, as to pluck
Crabbes out of their holes with his own hands, for the benefit of another.

CHAP. 15. The Monarchy of Spain inviteth the Cardinal of Toledo to be her
Theologian, which he refuses, and why.
THe report goes in this Court, that the Mighty Monarchy of Spain, by her
chief Secretary in vited the worthy Cardinal of Toledo, with allowance of a
large pension, to assist as her Theologian in the Royal Council of State, to
the end that no hing should be determined there, which might be against his
conscience: This matter filled the whole Court with marvel, in regard every
one knew how little that Prelate in the rebenediction of the most Christian King
Henry the 4. favored the affairs of his Prince; for which cause no man could
imagne the occasion, wherefore so wise a Queen in a business of such
weight, should use the service of so diffident a subject. Those which make
profession best to understand the manner of proceeding of the advised Spanish
Nation, even in this resolution acknowledged the inveterate prudence of the
Kings of Spain, whose proper custom it is never to be at quiet, until that
with pensions, with honorable Charges, with all kind of loving
demonstrations, and humane devises, they have drawn unto their party all such
great subjects, as they see to be alienated from their Interest, and from whom
they know, that one day yet they may receive services. The chiefest Confidents
of so great a Cardinal, deliver, that his Lordship very gladly accepted the
noble Charge propounded unto him; howbeit with this condition, (which by the
Spaniards was presently rejected) that whenever with the authority of the
sacred Scriptures, with the Doctrine of the holy Fathers, with the ordinances
of the Cannons, he should make the Royal Council capable, how the resolutions
made in it, were disagreeing from the Laws of God, and men; he alone then
would have power to hinder the execution of them; and all to the end, the
World might know, That the Royal Theologian in that Council was only to help
the conscience of his King with the will of God, not to serve for a mask to
establish the Dominion of Kingdoms over men; for it seemed too shameful a
matter unto him, that such a one as he should be employed to authorize the
diabolical impiety of the modern reason of State, and to make most stinking
Assa fetida appear unto simple people very excellent Musk.

CHAP. 16. The Spaniards attempt the acquisition of Savoy, but do not prevail.
SEeing that for to draw the French nail out of the table of Milan, where it
was fixed, the ill-advised Italian Princes had made use of the Spanish
pickaxe, which entered in such manner into the very table it self, that it was
never possible since to draw it forth with any kind of pincers whatsoever, all
the Potentates of Europe, and especially the Italian Princes, which perceived,
that the Spaniards after the servitude of the Milanesi, openly aspired to the
absolute Dominion of all Italy, to the end they might secure that remainder of
liberty, which is yet resting in her, agreed amongst themselves, that every
five and twentieth year, the Chain which the Spaniards have forged for the
Italian servitude, should with exact diligence be measured by persons
thereunto deputed. And coming (a few days since) accordingly to measure it,
the Italian Princes to their infinite amazement found, that so odious a Chain
was increased with five most prejudicial linkes; presently whereupon the
Political Smithes were called, who very carefully made an aslay of the iron
added to the Chain, and they found that the first link was forged at
Piombino, the other at Finale, the third at Correggio, the fourth at Porto
Lungone, and the last at Monaco. Greatly did the Princes marvel at the
strangeness of this accident, and many of them were ashamed, tht thorough
their careless simplicity the Spaniards had increased the Chain of the
Italian servitude, much more in peace, then they could have done in war with
four Armies. With these strange exorbitances, the Italian Princes were so
incensed against the Spaniards, that they told them freely, how if they did not
contain themselves within the bounds of honesty, and modesty; if the Italian
files would not suffice to reduce that miserable Chain to his due measure,
they would make use of the French; and if with them neither they could obtain
their intent, they would procure enough from England, and Germany; yea, and in
case of desperation they would not stick to furnish themselves with those
excellent damasked ones, that are made in Turkey. Whilst the Italian Princes
were in this contestation, there arrived a Post, which in all have had been
dispatched out of Italy unto them with this certain advertisement, That the
Spaniards were forging another link in Savoy, to be added unto the Chain of
their servitude: in regard of which news, the renowned Venetian Liberty
instantly opened her famous Arsenall, and all the Princes of Italy ran to
arm themselves; the warlike French Monarchy commanded her Nobility to horse,
all Germany put themselves in order to pass the mountains, and the numerous
Fleetes of the English, and Hollanders, set sail toward the streights of
Gibraltar; when just in the nicke, even as all the World was in Arms, a new
Post arrived, who pacified the minds of men with this intelligence, that
indeed it was true, how the Spaniards had labored with all possible industry
to forge that most important Link of Savoy, but that they had sweat in vain,
because in the soldering, it broke.

CHAP. 17. The Duke d'Alva being arrived at Pernassus, in complementing with
Prospero Colonna, they fall foul about defrauding the Colonesi of their Titles.
DOn Hernando de Toledo Duke d'Alva, a few days since, arrived at Pernassus,
and by express order from Apollo, a diligent examination of his actions being
made by the military men, he was found worthy to be admitted into Pernassus
amongst those famous Captains, which without effusion of blood, knew how to
vanquish an enemy, more by patience, and art, then by open force; or valor;
that durst hazard the fortune of Kingdoms upon the doubtful chance of a
Battle. But because Lodovico Guicciardino, an understanding Writer of the
affairs of Flanders; had preferred a Complaint, how that for certain matters
not very pleasing, which he had written of the Duke, he had been ill
entreated by him, therefore he stayed a long time to clear himself of such an
imputation; for there was an Edict of Apollo very rigorously observed in
Pernassus, whereby that Prince, or private man, was declared to be infamous,
which durst offer any wrong to any Historian, or other Writer, for things
written by him not very honorable, but yet true: Howbeit, of such power were
the Dukes friends that Guicciardino was contented to revoke his complaint,
whereupon withal the greatest solemnity he was admitted into Pernassus, and
had a place in his Majesty's Company of men at Arms, which was commanded by
that famous Quintus Fabius Maximus; who for the excellency of his well-aduised
wariness, was surnamed Cunctator. And it happened, that amongst the other
Princes, and Captains, which the said Duke visited, one was the most excellent
Lord Prospero Colonna, by whom he was received with all kind of honor; and so
much the more, because he understood that the Duke made a public profession of
being the disciple, follower, and imitator of his slow, but sure way of making
war. Howbeit, a strange and troublesome accident fell out in this visitation;
for at the first meeting, the Duke having given the Lord Prospero the Title of
your Honor, he was so incensed with disdain, that taking himself to be
highly wronged by so vile a title, with an angry voice he said; Duke, I had
thought thou were come hither, to honor one that is greater then thy self, not
to vndervalew him; but because it is the fashion of the Colonesi to answer the
injuries of words with deeds, go out of this house, and in the street (with
my sword in mine hand) I will prove unto thee, that all those, which use such
base terms to men of my rank, deserve not to be admitted into the Company of
honorable persons. The Duke remained much astonished to see that great
Captain take the matter so hainously at his hands; and going to withstand the
Lord Prospero, who offered to thrust him out of the chamber, they fell to
grapple one with another: And because the Spaniards, which were in company with
the Duke, seeing him in such terms with Colonna, entered into the chamber to
assist him: the Italians which belonged unto the Lord Prospero did the like;
whereupon in regard of the number of persons in so streit a place, there ensued
a cruel frey; the noise whereof coming into the street, was the cause that
the news of so dangerous an accident was suddenly carried to Apollo; who in
all have dispatched thither the Regent of the Vicaria with the guard of
Archers, who freed the Duke out of the Lord Prosperoes hands: and the uproar
being quieted, he commanded the Spaniards, that had been very ill handled,
to return home to their houses; Thereupon the Lord Prospero, to prevent any
sinister information that might have been given against him, presented
himself before Apollo, unto whom (the fame goes) with a troubled countenance
he used these words: Sir, it is well known, that men of the family of
Colonna, of the quality I am of, have always enjoyed the title of
Excellency, antequam Abraham fieret, and ere the Spaniards were in rerum
natura; Wherefore for that Nation to abuse a man of my rank, as the Duke d'
Alva did me but now, is most insupportable; for if the vileness of him that
offends, does infinitely aggravate the injury with him that is offended,
how is it possible, that an Italian Baron of my quality, should contain
himself within the bounds of modesty, seeing himself vndervalewed by that
Nation, whose miseries, not above four days ago to speak of, so moved the
whole World to compassion, that throughout all Churches they were recommended
to the charity of well-disposed Christians, of whom alms were gathered, to
free them from the miserable servitude, wherein they were so grievously
oppressed by the of Moors of Granada. The Spaniards enjoy the dominion of the
greater part of Italy; where, by such as I am, notwithstanding that daily they
threaten it with a cruel, and universal servitude, they are loved, honored,
and even served. With their prodigious avarice they have deprived us of out
wealth; and in that lamentable sack of Rome with their inexpressible lust
they violated the honor of our chastest Matrons. And now, in exchange of so
abject a patience, they would also take from us this little honor of breath we
enjoy, and these miserable Titles, the unhappy remains, and deplorable
relics of the Italian reputation: Which is a matter so hard to be digested,
that by every honorable Italian Baron it ought to be revenged, not with
complaining words, as I do, but with daggers points.

It is reported by them that were then present, how all the while the Lord
Prospero was speaking, Apollo did nothing but smile, and that when upon his
conclusion he burst out into those words, how the Spaniards abuses toward the
Italians were to be revenged with daggers points, he fell to laughing
outright, and said, Prospero, thou art, and ever were too much given over to
choler: and I am enforced to tell thee, how it infinitely mislikes me, that such
a one as thou, who have always made a particular profession of prudence,
should marvel, that slaves, which for twenty years together have been
fed in the Gallyes with course, and moldy Biscuit, when they light upon a
batch of new white Manchet, should fill their bellies till they are ready to
crack again: Whereas that raging appetite of theirs, and every other
dishonest act, which they use, to assuage their hunger, ought to be so far
from seeming odious unto honest men which behold it, that it should rather
moove them to pity. Therefore do ye Italians likewise permit, that the
Spaniards, men but new in this World, and lately got out of the servitude of
the Moors of Granada, may glut themselves with meat so delicate to their
taste, as are the honorable Titles, which they have found in Italy: for I
assure thee, that when they shall be cloyed with such vanities they also will
become, as the French are, such courteous Gallants, that they will willingly
give the Title of Excellency even to their horse-boyes, much more to such as
thou art. And I tell thee, that if thou had that prudence, and that perfect
knowledge of the World, as I vvish thou had, thou would very well
perceive, that those exorbitances, and that so odious manner of proceeding,
which the Spaniards use in Italy, whereof thou so complaynest, is even as so
much sweet sugar for you Italians, and bitter poison for the Spaniards; who if
to their valor, to their advisednesse, and unspeakable ambition which they
have to reign, they had affable and courteous manners annexed, with the utter
destruction of that remnant of Liberty, which is yet out of the Lions jaws,
they would soon become absolute Masters of the World. All which are
insolences, that with daggers points, not by you Italians, but by the
Monarchy of Spain herself, ought to be revenged with all kind of cruelty
on her Spanish Ministers, who with their vanity distaste the good servants of
so great a Queen, and make her government nothing acceptable to her subjects:
A disorder that bringing much difficulty to the substance of that Universal
Monarchy, whereunto it is not possible she can arrive with the public hatred
of all Italy, has high need of remedy.

With this answer Apollo returned the Lord Prospero exceeding well satisfied
to his house, after whom the Duke d'Alva appeared before his Majesty with all
his family wonderful melancholy, which cast such milk in their faces, that
the Spaniards seemed not so black, as ordinarily those Moors that come out of
Granada use to be. Then Apollo interrupting the complaint which the Duke was
about to make against the Lord Colonna, said; Duke, I am much displeased with
the disorder, which I understand has happened, and so much the more, by how
much the cause of such an uproar is not very just, nor vvithall very honorable
on thy side: And upon this occasion it pleases me to remember unto you
Spaniards, that to be not only niggards, as to all men ye are known, but not
to use prodigality in giving unto others those Titles, which are desired, is
a manifest sign of malignitie, because the ingenuous nobility of a Baron is
known, by showing little covetousness in receiving Titles, and much
liberality in giving them: For even by over much, not by due honor, does
greater reputation accrue to him that gives, then to him that receives it.
And you Spaniards, that use such austeritie in desiring great Titles only for
your selves, are not avvhit increased in reputation, but rather are become so
odious, and ridiculous to all men, that the Italians in their Comedies, have
deservedly introduced the personage of the Spanyard to represent unto the World
a perfect Braggadochia. I wonder ye should not preceive, that in thinking to
arrive unto the Dominion of the earth by abusing men, is the vvrong way to the
wood; The minds of men (Duke) are taken with the bait of humanity, with
the whistle of gratitude, of courtesy, of gentleness; and that Fowler would
show himself very ignorant, that should go with a drum into a Dove-house
for to take Pigeons, as I see you Spaniards, foolishly do. Moreover, I tell
you, that if ever any Nation were to make a bait of dignities, for to allure
the Italians to fall into the nets of your Dominions, and light upon the
Limebush of your servitude, it is you Spaniards, for the ends which ye have
upon Italy: Withal ye are to consider, that the States, which ye possess,
of Naples, and Milan, are fastened unto you with Wax; for ye shall command
over those two members no longer, then till the Italians resolve to chase you
from thence; who if they could be assured, that after your ruin, they should
not fall into the power of the French, ye should quickly know, that only with
a little disturbance, which they could give you in the Port of Genoua, they
would put you into a thousand intricate difficulties: all matters, that should
admonish you to give satisfaction, at leastwise in words, to them, whom in
regard of your Interests in Italy, ye are obliged to respect. As for the
injury, which you say you have received from the Lord Prospero, I tell you
plainly, that whatsoever affront shall be done you upon any such like Titular
occasion, I will not only be insensible of it, but I will think you have
desirously sought it. Then the Duke would have excused himself with saying,
that from his King he had instruction how to carry himself toward the Italian
Barons in the particular of Titles, when Apollo told him, that the Spanish
abuses to the Italians were not to extend but only to the Neapolitans, and
Milanesi; and his Majesty also added, That if much passion did not blind the
Spaniards, they might easily see, how their Grandes, whom Spain it self could
not contain, and that in Italy, would play the Giants, compared with the
Roman Barons; and those of mean stature would prove but dwarsses. Hereupon a
cloud, as white as snow, beginning by little and little to cover the person of
Apollo, the Priests that were about him perceived how his Majesty would
prophecy; so that every one falling prostrate on the ground, and with the
rest, the Duke and his followers; out of that hollow cloud proceeded the divine
voice of his Majesty, which with a pleasing sound spoke in this sort: I
fortell unto you, Spaniards, that with your rough and odious manner of
proceeding, ye will one day compel the Italian Nobitie; which is the Mistres
of the cruel Sicilian Vespres, to plot some bloody Neapolitan Even-song
against you; it being the proper custom of the Italians, with greater rage to
revenge the abuses of words, then the offenses of blows; as they that having
short patience, and long hands, are borne not only with an heart most inclined
to great resolutions, but that do not use to revenge injuries with all kind of
cruelty, before they are quite forgotten by those that did them. And with your
own ruin, you will then find them, with swords in their hands, to be
Paladine Orlandoes, when ye shall persuade your selves, they are become most
suffering Asses.

The Post of Pernassus to the Reader.
THese Papers coming by chance into my hands, I perceived there was something
in them that I could not perceive; wherefore I thought best to communicate them
with better understandings: for my part I could see no hurt in them, but did
imagine by that little good which I saw, there was much more that I could not
see, and therefore judged them fit for all men's eyes. Yet finding the names of
Spain and Austria, or Austria and Spain, (pardon me, politic Reader, for I
am not certain which should have priority; and I know in such Catholic
points, a little error is deadly) so often inserted, I durst not be too bold
with sacred things. For I well saw those two names jointly considered, are now
grown of such estimation, as all Nations and Kings bend their knees, and doffe
their Bonnets at the naming of them; more superstitiously for destroying, then
reverently at the Name of Jesus for saving. Therefore I could not resolve,
whether it were treason or sacrilege, or I wot not what greater sin, to
touch sacred things profanely with common and unwashed hands; especially when I
saw all such as had done the like, or less then thus, made miserable examples
of disobedience, as if they had offended Adam himself, or a house miraculously
raised up by God, or rather originally created in nature, to rule over all the
world in Adams stead; and that to be the son of a King, could not protect an
offender in this kind from punishment, yea, from being cast out of his
Paradise. O (thought I) when I saw this, how worthy is he, that does thus to
be counted only the Catholic King: for he is a King of kings indeed, fit to
be the executioner of his Holiness divine Decrees, and to consume all with
Lightning, where the sacred fulminations went before. Tremble all Princes,
and look to your Crowns; especially you perty ones in Germany, that are but
fatted to be swallowed one after another, as his stomach can digest, or your
turn comes to be served up. You see it is safer being his servant, then the
son of any Potentate besides. Therefore strive for place and preferment
there, and help with all the speed ye may, to betray one another to ruin.
You that are Protestants or Lutherans, it is no matter for Religion; hold some
the stirrup, and let others lift Spain into the saddle, to ride one another
like Poste-horses by turns. You see how honorably he deals with that
Prince, whose peaceable patents made him easy entrance; and how favorably
with the Palatinate, whom he rides in blood, and spur-galls on both sides,
whilst you stand laughing on, and see not that your day is coming.

Thus I thought, and thought withal to be silent, and to keep these Papers
from flying abroad, for fear of having my own vvings clipped. But when I saw
in defect of greater, God had raised up petty Princes to defend the Faith, and
put that spirit into the Prince of Orange, the Count Man^felt, and the Duke of
Brunswicke, which he had taken from Saxony and Bavaria, and others, it made
me resume courage, beholding the immediate hand of God in this work, and to
think, surely God will have all the glory to himself, that he employes such
instruments, whose estates, in comparison, are but drops to the Spanish Ocean:
I will not therefore be guilty of so much cowardice, as to reserve my self,
where these men fight, and seem prodigal of their own lives; or at least,
not of so much dishonesty, as to conceal what God has sent into my hands,
perhaps to publish for the general information and benefit of all
Christendom. Go out therefore, and prosper in Gods Name.

FINIS.
