TO THE AVCTOR OF the counterfaicte conference etc.
ITvvere as easy for meyf Ivvould to discover your name with assured proofs
as to detect the devises and dristes of your conterfeat conference made at
Amsterdam, but since as it seameth you are ashamed to iustifye the same with
your name, I am not he that will publishe it, because it might be thought by
sum that are redye to enterpret things to the vvorst that hatred might
induce me thereunto, that which I desire chefely to be effected by this
discourse next to the inconvenience that might generally have grown by your
fraud and desceit vndesciphred is that you would look upon your ignorance or
malice or perhaps both, which is manifest by seakinge to maKe division
between Christian Princes that are in charity and friendship one with an
other, by defacing the Monarchical state, which so long time has been used
and approved, and by disposinge of the Croune of England not vveighinge
vvheare the right lies, but vvhear your fa^cye best likes; if in this later
poit your would excuse your self by sayng you determine no man's title, the
course of your whole Book and diuerses practices de facto shevue the
contrary.

These things be not os small weight or importance, for that they concern
kings and kingdoms, and require the practice wisdom and experience of
other manner of heddes then yours is, yea and that in nombre to the asse^bly of
a Court Parliament. Tharfore your may see what cause of discontentement you
give to all wise and indifftrent men, and what disgrace you have braught to
your self and brethren, for thar if any happen to be king of England besides
those tvuo you would seem most to advance, it is likelye, according to the
rules of policye and state that your self will be in question for meddlinge in
these matters abo ue your reach and capacitye, and your brethren will be
blamed and banished out of the Country for approuinge, or at the least for not
chastisinge your lewd and yvell demenor, methinketh the preventing of these
incomodities should ma ke you consider of sum remedies, and the remorse of
your conscience should breed repentance which cominge from the botome of
you heart will force you in as ample and public manner to disclame and
disauovve your said conference, as ever passion and partialitye did inuit you
to set forth the same. This is the best and casiest way to satisfy the
Princes discontented the people scandalized, and your self endaungered, and
this is that I suppose your vvisest friends will advise you unto: for my
particular, I do pray for you, and vvishe no way revenge to your person, but
re formation in your manners, as God I call witness, who direct you to that

A DISCOVERYE OF A COVNTERFECTE CONference, held at a countersecte place, by
counterfecte travelers, for thaduanceme^t of a counterfecte title, and
invented, printed, and published by one (PERSON) that dare not avovve his name.
IT is observed, and has been noted, long in the world, that no Vanitye is
so light vvhiehe bears not sum credit, no fable so fantastical, but some
will believe it, nothing so disorderly attempted which has not fovvnd a
supporter. Even so it falls ovvt touching a certain vain diet appointed
sum yearespast to abuse the world under the title of a conference about the
next succession to the Crown of England, being in deed a confused bablinge
of Idle troublesome trauailers, without interest to deal in such matter, and
a very confederacy of a practice against the blood Royal, state and
dignitye, of that nation.

Therefore vvantinge the true and The book of succesfio^ is put fourth as a

certain of place, person, author, and other due circomstances; it may well
be called an infamous fablinge chartel or Libel, feigned to be conceived in
Holland, known to be fostered in spain, falselie fathered of R. Dolman,
printed at N. to wit, no certain place Justifiable, with license of, it may
not be knovve^, who. Nevertheless all must be so commended at the first sight
for pleasure and vtilitye, the author so extolled for sharpness of vvitte,
plentye of much readinge cunninge in conueyhance, abondance of eloquence, and
other graces, as none can find any want or default. Nay (to amplify the
estimation as well of the author as of the libel) it is provided that
whosoever by word, deed, or contenance seems to dislike the one or the
other: all such persons must be reputed by a common fame, and there upon
condemned as enemies to the private designs of the king Catholic, and
adversaries to the common cause. Albeit it is very likely that the late king
of spain, nor this king living were ever priuye to the contents of that
Libel, nor expressly consented to the publishinge thereof, as will appear
heareafter, Therefore it is but a ridiculouse The book was prejudicial to the

sentence so rashelye to censure men, and very partial, such also, as
adua^ceth the credit neither of king, nor cause.

For when a man pretendethe a claim never heard of in any age, to an other
man's land whose quiet possession actually, and right also apparently in all
wise men's eyes, have concurred and continued many hundreds of years, in him
and those whose state and title he has, and inioyeth, no indifferent wise
man will allow, that the sodainlye supposed pretendor may have any reason by
a bare claim to think that he should bear all away without contradictio^:
especially when the claim excedeth measure, is misliked generally, and
brings with it suspicion of evil dealinge other vvayes, as made by
trauailinge strangers, without the supposed pretendors vvarrant and priuitie.
In respect vvherof, and for want of upright behavior, the same crime may be
imputed more Justly to the Libellor, and his libell, as prejudicial to the
same king and cause.

For as there are many indifferent persons in diverse nations, all The

a like affected to the matter of suc cession, not caringe what way it
run: and are not tied to the king in any special obligation, nor alienated
from his Ma. nor from the said cause, who are persuaded that a redier course
might have been taken under a better pretense for advancement of both: Even
so, there are many others of the same opimon, who (if compariso^s may be
allowed) are accounted to have as much interest as the libeller and his
trauailinge consorts have in the matter of successio; and have better vvarrant
of Law and in defense of Law to reprove that conference; then those
conferrers have without Law and against law, to iustifye or commend it,
yea; have been fouvnde hitherto as ready (hopinge God vvillinge so to continue)
as the practizers in that conference, to advance the common cause every
lavvfull way, and the said kings honorable designs also, and to do to his
Ma. services and offices in advancement of his honor to the uttermost of
thaire power, mary in ordine adDeum, and vsque ad aras, so far fouth as they
may in adue order toward God, and with saftie of a rectified conscience; and
More the^ this [I am sure] so good a king will not requyer.

Therefore what so ever the said The conference to be disliked for three
reasons.
practizers for their pleasures and profits do pretend, and blovv a brood by
words and clamours against others, for the Catholic kings private or
public designs, or for the common cause: true it is, that such as findinge
the^ seliues thus affected to Gods honor and safetye of their consciences, and
there upon vnvvillinge to incouraige the said practizers and their conference,
are the bolder to speak against both, as they have greater reasons, and more
effectual motives in weight and measure to dislike boath; And that in respect
as well of the matter, as of the manner or form, and of circumstances
touching theffect that may depend thereof or concur there vvithall;
accomptinge for matter the lothesome drifts and scoopes whereunto the said
conference does tend; for manner and form, such absurd vvayes and means as
these ca^uassers have devised, to abuse the world, and thereby to work there

inconuenie^ces thretned not only to the english nation, but also to the whole

services.

The principal scoape and dryft, Tbe scope of the conference.
first in mind, though last in operation, and in mean while dissembled
(besides the deposi^ge, of the present possessor) is to supplant, dispossess,
and disherit the true heir and lavvfull successor of the english Crown, with
all the ofspri^ge, to translate and alter the ancient laws and customs of
that Realm, and consequently to tra^sforme the government of that Nation in
to a Province; or at the least to thrust in to the Royal throne, against the
right course of english laws, a forainer bred and borne far of, which
neither in her own person, nor any branch of the root from whence these
practizers pretend to derive her title, was aver herd or tho ught of in the
memory of man, nor before mentioned in any record of any age, to such effect
or purpose as now is devised; Nay if any such things have been spoken of,
these smoothe conferers have practiced in time past to suppresseit, and to
bear the garland an other way, and that not long a go, as hear after
shall be declared.

And for the vvayes and means Tbe vvayes to the mark.
to dravv this on, they are many, but all rovvghe, vneauen, tedious, indirect,
out of the high way that may be lead to any good end, all things well
weighed, yet agreeable to such an attempt: as in like trouble some interprises
it falls out, that odd shifts must be made for tools to remove blocks, to
skovver strets, and make vvays clearer, for crafty surmises, and vvily
insinuations to walk more smoothely and curra^tly to the Mark. Touchig the
scopeandbutte of the book, I will speak hearafter generally, for the
particular mischiefs thereof every true english man does throvvghlye see at
the first sight, In the mean time, let us search the vvayes to see what
monsters lie hydden therein; And so we shall find theffects like to follow the
practizes of these conferrers, what gloriouse pretense so ever they give.

Thersore, first to begine vvithall, emonge diverse Crafty shifts A general
compact of the conserrers so bring england to the Civil laws Roman.
which we find there is a device to make the mattet seem good by all laws
as well Civil Roman, as municipial english, touching Civil government and
direction of thenglishe nation, for guidinge the course of that Crown,
Although the same device be opposite to that ancient ordonaunce, which for
abolishinge the force of Cesars Civil laws our of that Realm, and for
establishinge a municipial law there was ordained by authority of that
famous holy father Pope Eleutherius even in the begininge, when Christian
Religion was first universally planted in that Island, and with the full
consent, and upon request as well of the Christien King of great britain,
Lucius, as also of his nobilitye spiritual and temporal lords of that Realm.

This device being once set down, then two lawyers, the Aspecial compact
that two lawyers, and not lavvmust be vmpiers of this matter.
one a ge^tilma^, theother a special temporal lavver of england must be
brought in to represent the persons of all other lawyers of professions, and
with the tongues ofbothe those laws, Thies two (which never before agreed
in this affayre, and many other) must be now made fryends (or else all were
marred) to conspire with certain Idle troublesome trauailers against the
municipial laws, yea contrary to the purpose why both those laws were
made, which is to make peace: and against the profession of all good
lawyers, which is to resolve doubts and quarrels spetially when dyets are
appointed for consultation, as the final cause of this assemblye touching
such an affayre, would have been, if it had been called in gods name, and
collected of settled men, and not of won dringe trauailers: well, this new
reconciliation of ancient adversaries, is now thought to be necessary, as in
like practizes of innovation has been often used against truth and Justice,
for now, by their agreement, we must have not only a tra^sfiguration of the
shape and form of that common wealth but a transmutation also, or translation
at least of the very matter, vvher upon the true common wealth of england,
and every particular man's state does rest, and that is the laws, and lavvful
customs of that Realm, as a special mean to hail us al to the forsay de
scope: And all this must be contrived through thattonement of this two
lawyers, by a more spedy intrusion of Cesars Civil Roman laws thovvgh they
are by authentic authority long ago abolished, and by continual silence
worn out of use and buried with a free consent of the whole nation in many
ages.

1. And among many conclusions Six Articles of the la-
agreed upon between these vvyers agreement.
two, one must be, that what soever the Ciuilien says, our te^porall
lawyer must svvere and subscribe to it, be it true or false: and he must up
hold the Ciuilia^ with yea or nay at all assayes that may serve to
overthrow the municipiall laws of england with out respect to the
vveightye reasons and sage considerations thereof derived from the laws of God
and nature, as most agreeable to the co^ditio^s and qualityes of that nation.

2. An other conclusion is that The Ciuilian must lead the temporal lawyer.
these two lawyers thus prepared for opinions and affections must set
forvvard, so as the Ciuilia^ shall lead the way, and the temporal lawyer
must follow, the Ciuilian shall go before, not as the angel Raphael went
before young Tobye, to chase a way murderinge devils, but to call in
mischieues upon mischieues al manner of vvayes by contentiouse spirits: not to
demand due dets upon law fall spetialties, but to make undue dets and bank
roupte by plain rauin and robbery: not to procurre a marriage by order of law
with due respect to proximitye of blood, but to breed a deuorse of friendship
in kindred by disturbinge the lavvfall liniall course of consanguinitye provided
by laws, for passaige of thinheritance and succession, and that in such a
sort as has not been allowed by Judgment of law to pass in england
though by violence some such enormities have been intruded and bolstered for a
while to the horrible ruin of many noble families not recouerable. The
temporal lawyer also for his part must follow as an echo not between two
hills or like place upon stoppage of breathe for modestye or fear: but in
plain fields not subject to rebovvnds boldly without blushinge to correspond,
not caringe if all true english men of all sorts and degree do vvonder after
him; yea he must follow, not as the little kind Dog followed young To bye to
serve his right master: but as the mastyue follows the Tinker for his own
commodity, to bear the burden, lest his master over labored could not
attaineto his Inn, and him self should leese his bayte, for it appears
demonstratiuely that the Ciuilians credit for this matter, in the sight of all
true english me^ would be little vvorth is the temporal lawyer were not
present to contenance the same: And if the Ciuilians plea be rejected, the
temporal lawyer must seek his meat in the mire: for he deserves to be
casten over the bar, as an ambidexter: Nevertheless he can not stand this
way also in any great stead at theende when the matter comes to hammeringe
by right tools.

3. A third conclusion of this accord Popularitye.
is that these two lawyers must conform them selves somevvhat to the manners
and conditions of those troublesome tribunes, the paires or couples of
pensioners among the states of the low Countries: so as by treadinge the
steps of popularitie they may Imprint a favorable opinion and liking of this
purpose in the pha^sies and conceits of people who ever delyghte in change,
and love much to have such houlde on the bridle as they may co^ptreol their
Sovereign or overthrow him out of the sadle, when they list: Therefore a
popular doctrine must Popular Doctrine.
be published as a law, and there upon must follow a difinitiue sentence
indifinitlye that thinherita^ce and succession of the Sovereign government in
that Realm does depe^de upon a multitude, so as at their pleasure they may
pike a quarrel sufficient to disthrone their lavvfull king and when they
list to call for an election of a new king, because their pleasure must stand
for a law in this case. And this multitude forsothe must bear the name of a
common vvelthe when they comme to gither, though often times it falls out to
be a common mischief or universal confusion: yea and assembled only or
principally by aCanuasse and practice ofsome one or other popular person,
malcontent, and seditiouse or ambitious: which by a gracious opinion among the
people is hable to bring the may game home to his own or frynds houze; for
how, and by what authority, that multitude is to be assembled, and other
circumstances most expedient and necessary, thies lawyers neither define, nor
regard, It is suficient at this time in their books and for their purpose, if
their assemblye bear a show of a common wealth by sum presence of the
nobilitye and commons, any thing or matter that by these two lawyers is
expressed to the contrary notwithstanding. And this sentence thus generally
set down, is to be made good allowed and ratiffied by pretense of so^me
principals, maxims, or assertions of Civil law or lawyer, such as though
in special cases, for some singular respect, in a private sense, upon due
circumstances, and necessary occasions (to speak only touching
designements, and ordinances of a true unfeigned common vveth and not other
wise) may be true, and have sum grovvnde in the Civil law, yea in common
reason, and may also stand with thenglish laws: yet nevertheless to serve
these men's turns, in pleasinge the multitude, they must be made general with
out exception, to ouerrule the municipial laws of england, And this sentence
must also be confirmed by examples and patterns of practizes executed in
colorable common vveathes, or rather disordered multitudes, being no common
wealths in deed, but prodigious monsters of many heads, with out a good
foot to stand upon, and in material points for temporal affairs agreeable to
that of Holande and Zelande at this day: So as those most seditiouse rebels
shall be hable to auouche this popular doctrine by authority of thies two
lawyers to vvarra^t their rebellio^s against their most lavvfull Sovereign.
Therefore (by the way) a man may note what good feruice thies conferers have
done by this popularitye to that most renoumed king Catholic, in geuinge to
his Ma. a colorable pretense of title to an other kings Crown, to minister
matter of vvarrant for a rebellious rout to thrust him self fourth of his
own Crown.

4. Besides this popular Doctrine, we must have an other deuis to lead the
multitude under a penthouse in the shadovve of a law more nearer the mark
now shot at against the lineal course of inheritance in cases os feesimple.
Therefore other allegations must Feigned mnximes of foreing
be brought in to the court by the laws to direct the Crown.
Ciuilian as principels and maxims derived from his law, which in deed are
no other the^ fancies or opinions of theone side of a controversy, whereunto
it likes now this Ciuilia^ to subicribe, never set down in the corpsof that
law, but fovvnd in comments and gloses of lawyers as notes or memorials of
exercises, or of allegations upon suits passed on the behalf of some clie^t,
never defined authentiquelie by common consent, but remain as letigious,
apliable (like the rules of lesbos) to the diversities of men's opinions
grovvinge upon affections, or other irresolute concepts. Nevertheless they
must no vv be all defined as true and certain on that side whereunto it likes
thies lawyers to lean. And if they happen to stumble upon a certain rule
either in the body of the Civil law, or in the note books and monuments of
Ciuilians, that must either have such constructio^, as pleases this Ciuilian
to enforce, or else it must be said to stand certain and clear also for english
affairs, and be preferred before the most current ru, les, and most certain
maxims of our english municipiall lavvies, how opposite so ever they be to
the^glish form of la vufull government. And a according to this Ciuilia^s
rules must the inheritance and succession of the english Crown be squared for
the covvrse thereof to run as pleases this Ciuilian to uphold the same with
the bolster of a fre^ ticke multitude seduced by a conterfaited temporal
lawyer: for every factious assembly (if it once take place, and carry all
way clean) must be accounted for a common wealth in thies men's books, be
they neuere so often assembled in one year, every one opposite to the other
in all extremities. And by the practizes, gests and procedings of such common
vvealths must thies axioms and principles be confirmed as by imitable and
exemplare patterns at all assays: So as to help or hinder any pretend or in
this case it must be sufficient by thies men's rules to say, this or that was
done without respect to this or that ought to be done: or what the law
says for her self against this or that act: Thus are we now come by help of
thies men's Doctrine to revive and allow for lavvfull the sayenges and doings of
old tyra^tes (who to justify their vvikednesse usurped in a maliciouse sen
ce that ancient proverb: quod exem. plo fit id iure fit) every thing, be it
never so bad is lavvfully done, if it can be exemplified to have been done,
espetially of a multitude, that may seem to bear the color of a common
wealth. As if a Tyrant defacto and malefacto, upon possession, and unjust
possession too, shall therefore be a true king de Iure right fully by order of
law: As if right ought to follovv possession, and possession should rule the
right: As if an unlawful bare possession of the dissezor and his heirs in
case of inheritance and succession by a lineal disce^t to that Crown ought by
law to dishable the right of a disseizer and his heyrs, or in any other, ovvt
of the point of lavvfull prescription: a prik of a vveapo^ sharper the^ thies
lawyers vvil be hable to ward, If the matter come to a demurre in law.

5. Furthermore the trauailers for Practice for aco^mon fame.
their parts must help the credit of thies lawyers by a couple of odd
shiefts, or else all will not go straight, for by the means of their
raunginge throvvgh by countries, we must have a common opinion settled every
where, if it be possible, that all is true which thies two have said, as
agreeable to the laws of nations; And consequently a common fame of three
horrible blasts must course both air and earth to possess the minds and
mouths of the idle world specially among the symplest and most credulous
of one side, which for meede or dreede ar to be lead away, among such of an
other side as are naturallye disposed, or maliciously incited to desire a
change; The first blast is an untrue surmise of a doubt fullness A furmised
dovvtfullnesse.
to be in the municipial laws of england touching the inheritance and
succession of the Crown of england, who ovvght to have it albeit in truth
the matter is very clear in the Judgment of the same law and of all the
wise men, lawyers, and others which have interest to Judge thereof, as whose
states do depend there upon: Nevertheless it appears by their own
confession that the doubt shall lie, not in the law who ought to have it,
but in theuent who shall have it: not upon right but upon the opportunity of
time.

The second blast is a dangerous insinuation, full of sclaunderous A dangerous
insinuation.
untruth and intolerable in dignity with contradictio^, that the Realm of
england is at this day, and has been many hundred years destitut of a
lavvfull Sovereign. And upon thies two must follow a third, to wit a
general challenge A sediciouse cballenge.
for the Crown for when that surmise of doubtefulnesse has possessed the
minds of the people; all competitours and preten vvil take occasion of
chalengde, every one for him self, and the most mighty by force or friendship
vvil bear all away; And the other blast by insinuation shall serve as a
motive to enforce the people of al fortes for their own indemnitie, either to
seek the blud Royal vvher so ever they think it to be: every one after his
own conceit (and to bring it home if it can be found, or to intrude one or
other into the place, and affervvarde for a color of in diferencie to call for
an election of a king or Queen by the device of thies traualers, who mind
to sovvnde a trompette that there is not now living any of thenglish blood
Royal borne in england, nor else where inheritable of that Crown, or
capable of it, save only, theone of two, they care not whether and those
must be the late Catholic king him self, or else his daughter.

6. And (to speak some what in Shyfts to further surmise by complyinge with
the time.
particular touching the absurdity of the said surmise) it greueth my very
heart to consider what pains thies men do take to consume their natural
country with the terrible fire of great discord and evil division, and to
what foul shifts they are driven, that they may carry all away cleanly, lest
they be accounted among them, which even the^ are most deceitful, when they
most pretend to be just.

Therefore to put the world fourth of suspicion, and them selves fourth of
Ielouzie. (an inconvenience that comenly happens when old foes are be comme
new frye^des) thies two lawyers, for an other conelusio^ must comply vuith
the time like weather wise me^ oflesbos, for thies devises can not be so
closely rolled up but that simulation must walk smothely, either with
tergiuersation to please and displease, or with yea and nay to Dissimulatitn
and duplicitie in speech must be used.
contredict them selves, and in fine, to cover all with doublinge and
redoubling between plain words and crooked meaninges, from one sensse to
ane other, as far as any equivocation, pregnancye or other elenche of
Sophistree, legier demai^, or deceipte of sight ca^ help for carriage of all
away uvith the general drist; And (as I said before, which is to be noted
after) lest their surmise of doutfulnes in law do fail, they vvil in the
end depend upon times, specially as they may be made to stand, more then
upon doutfullnes of law, So as to them may well be applied, that odle
proverb, Omnia pro tempore, nihil proveritate, they measure all according to
the time, and nothing to the truth, like men given over, to vayn talk,
desirous to be accounted Doctors in law, and either understand little, or
regard less, what they affirm or deny, if their own turn may be served
vvithall, no not though the world do eth see how miserabli their own
co^scie^ces may be gauled by such shifs: for better evidence hereof No heyr
apparent must he knovve^.
we may note other old corners of particular shifs that thiese men are forced
to seek for pleasig the time to further their surmise, for though they world
confesses, and none will be fovvnd so Impudent as openly to deny that as all
men universally and in particular are bovvnd by the law of God and nature to
vvish and desire the co^finuance and happy preservation of common quiet wealth
and felicity of their native Country: so are they also by the same laws
bovvnd every one for their degree of qualitye, condition and possibility, to
employ all their bodilye trauails, all their external powers with discourse
of reason, pregna^cye of wit, cares, industries, and al their internal forces
to provide best means for furtherance and advancement of the same common quiet,
wealth and felicity, yea and to prevent, cast of and eschew all Impediments
thereof, and all occations that may breed any peril to the same, And albeit
among the commodities co^curring with the happy state of a Realm next to the
reverent love and due obedience of subjects to God and to their Sovereign for
the time being the greatest preservative of quiet among people, by confession
of vvisest men, is to fore know an heir apparent of the Crown: so among
all the inconveniences that can be practiced against the prosperouse estate of
a Country, that embraces an ordinarye disce^t of their Sovereign by way
of inheritance and succession in a certain know issue and ofspringe in a
linial course according to a municipial law, or lavvfull custume None is more
wicked, in it self, more pernitiouse to the state more untunable in the
earses of al godly wise men, nor more sca^dalouse to the whole world, the^
is either to houlde the opinions ofsubiects in suspense and dovvt, without
offer of resolution, what that person is to whom they ought by order of
law to bear allegiance after decesse of their present Sovereign, or by any
way or mean to broache or to nsinuat any dout or ambiguitye thereof, where
there is a settled opinion of all wise men to the contrary. And though it be so
evident and demonstrable as needs no exemplification how careful good
princes, and sovvnd common vvealths have been in times past to avoid such
ambiguities, and how curious some kings have been in such a case, who
having lavvful issues inheritable and capable of that Crown, with out
exception, suspicion, scruple, or doubt never the less before their death,
have by spetiall oaths, and cerimonious submissions of their own principal
subjects, established the state expectant in their issue: not for any dout in
law touching the true and lavvfull title of their issue in the right of
inheritance, (as these two lawyers would wrest that good providence of
princes but to arm them selves and their issue against all events, for
preventing of ambicious and seditious purposes of popular persons, who at
change of Princes use to put out their horns more boldly then before, upon
confidence of advantage by opportunity of time, to dravveuents contrary to
thintention and expectation of the law, ascope whereunto thies lawyers shoot
all their bolts, Al thies euidentes and confessio^s of truths, and all thies
stratagemes and prouide^t policies of good Princes and sovvnd common vvealths
notwithstanding, our two lawyers with their trauailers have taken courses
quyte contrary, In so much as by neglecting, yea vvilfull rejecting the
foresaid provisions and good policies for preservation of common quiet by
mature cautions and remedies of laws against mischieues and inconveniences
that may grovve by want of due foresight to know and acknovvledge a lavvfull
heir and succession to the Crown, Thies men do practice by all means to
hail men headlonge in to vvilfull doutfulnesse and ignorance thereof: And to
furthcr their purpose with a gloss of flatery, to please this time, the
Queen must be justified, and her doeinge commended for prohibiting the
declaration of an heyr apparent, so as it must be well allowed that no
special law or order be established to cut of all dovvts in law or time
that may Justly grow for want of a certain known successor to be named in
her life, how dangerous so ever the delay thereof may be esteemed for the
time to come, for so thies conferrers are not ashamed to conclude in express
words; A most monstrouse excess in speech against all reason equity and
good conscience. And this must be hudled up with fevv words as a confessed

to pretend and claim a title, both men and women, to make the matter much
more dovvtfull, as the number of prete^dors increases more and more; though in

is not long syns they both should have been excluded and an other preferred, if

circumstances and an infinite number of particular enormities, absurdities,
mischiefs and inco^ueniences concurringe with this popular Doctrine, A wise
man may easily conceive what commendatio^ thies two lawyers deserve for

way of preocupation and forstalling of men's conceits at first sight to
avoid all farther examination of their strange proceadings, for they have

consequently to hail and dravv innocents through bloody shambles, to massacre

event be not answerable to their desires. Therefore what course so ever
thieslavvyers with their aduocats, proctours atturneys, solicitours,
porsuyuants and apparetors would seem to take toward God, or the world in
words, and what fault so ever they would impute to others touching the said
kings private designs, or a common cause, It is in very deed more then

enough and to many in number, for maKi^g of a party to give a shovv of a common
wealth hable to wage battle in open field against their lavvfull Queen, to
thrust her in to prison, and after to expel her for the of her own
dominions, and finally to practice her death in a foreing Country: a most
barbarouse fact, and such, as against it, thies lawyers have in times past
exclamed mightily with mouth and penn. Nevertheless if the Doctrine which
thies men allow be true, (as it pleases them to deliver it,) we must also
allow this fact, as good and imitable, being done by a common wealth.

And upon what other grovvnd the^ this, did those madd ministers in Scottla^de
snacthe the brydel in to their own hands, and in most malepert manner
presumed to thret ten their king that he shall be sent after his mother; if he
will not maintain the Covvrse that they had begone, meaning their heretical
practizes against his mother and his mothers frie^des, and allow their
fantastical and irreligious covvrses, as if he were but a King made of
clouts, and not framed nor formed by order of law to succeed in a course of
inheritance, but to be let in, and put ovvt at their pleasur by authority of a
common wealth of their own making, such a one, as never God nor good me^
have seen read or heard of a worse and such as no wise and discrete king
can or will endure. Even so did not that unnatural wicked traiter, Antonio

by help of the said Doctrine procure a rebellion in Arrago^ against his natural

and had he not thereby prevailed so far by all likelyhode, as to have his
practice to be accounted an imitable stratageme of a common wealth, if God
would have permitted such malice to reign in that coaste? I could exemplify
what mischief the same doctrine has wrought in England, but I pass

rabble of artificers and handy crafts men, under a glorious style and title of

maintain: for la vvful all their ovvtragious and malipert rebellions and
enormities more then hethenish against their Soueraign, and against the
sovvndest part of the nobilities and commons under a cloak of a common
wealths authority? yes without dovvbt; And what so ever gloss or comment
our said lawyers will make for excuse, certain it is that their own text (as
they have delinered it to he world in word and exe^plified it by deeds forth
of this late co^fere^ces) vvil serve those vnstatlye states to make a
commodity for service against their Soueraign when our two lawyers have
said and done what they ca^, for there has not come many years among that
unbridled people a Doctrine more plausible tha^ this, which so largelye and

where Ileft) the disseruices of thies two lawyers come now to be more
agruated by presuming to publish or to offer such a scandalovvse Doctrine to be
published or printed within his Ma. dominions, were it set foth with his

though it may be suffered to pass with an ordinaire license in general manner
consigned by some common censurer of books upon a favorable motion or by
abusinge the credulity of some authority allowed to be published, which may
be also doubtful: All this not with standing, no proof appears that it has

king, so authentiklie, as every man being under his allegiance is bovvnde to
take notice the of, and prohibited to show his reasonnable conceit touching

contemptible shall the Ma. of a king stand in such a case. And the reason of
this prerogative over their king is (say thies lawyers) because forsuthe a
king was made for a common wealth, and not a common wealth for a king; As if

wealth to obey the king. Beside these indignities touching Ma. and state

bevvirchi^g the phansies of men with plausible matter, for more cleanly
conueyhance of a consent to their purpose, his wisdom would have utterly
rejected that libell, for he would have quickly perceived the contradiction
between their opinions in show of words, and their real proceedinges in
practizes, where they hold titles of princes once settled and admitted are not
to be examined by private me^, but to be obeyed: Nevertheless thies companions
now (as at other times (have not only allowed such examinations, but have
also presumed upon their ovvue heads, to examine titles of kings and Queens,
and to determine them also by circumstaunce, yea by way of consultation in a
public conference, as if they were caled by authority, not as private me^,
but as public persons. Besides this his vvisdome would Flatterye and

have noted an od shifte of deskant by flatterye and dissimulation to gleane
so^me credit of the present state in England (for that state is now settled)
though they have practiced the contrary in time past: A pretty toy to mock an
Ape, but it is so gross as she may easelye perceue it, and for their merit
make them a movv, even so where their words run so rovvndly to curry favor
(for fear of displeasinge possessors) that what so ever a princes title be,
if once he be settled in the Crown and admitted by the common wealth, it is
not to be examined by any private men: every man is bovvnd to settle his
conscience to obaye the same, And the reason [for so the] is that of all other
they esteame the honor of a Crown to be most irregular and extraordinary:
here his Ma. wisdom and zeal to regal dignity generally, Blasphemis

beside his own ptiuat, may discover diverse fallacies, errors,
contradictions, yea and mo^struous absurdities, accompting their common wealth
to be such as are comfortable to their own examples, or other wise as good
as they would make it.

For by this Doctrine it must Absurdities against both king and subject.
follow necessarilye as most consonant to reason, that the common wealth
which is to controole regal dignity (i^ such sort as their men appoinr)
has to challenge a preuileige to be guided by the holly ghost, not subject to
error, in opinion or sentence iudicially, and so anew fovvndation of a special
maxim must be lay de for heretics and rebels to buyld upon it what they
list, to wit R^^^bliea non potest errare, a common wealth can not err which
is more then sum common vvealths vvil allow to the church of God.

Again it must follow that no member of such a common wealth is to be
accounted a private person nor privately carie^d away daylv and hovvrely
remouable from his own opinion, nor may examine the matter priuatli before or
after he come to conferr thereof, or else their admission is not sufficient by
this rule of theirs. More over these two lawyers and all those trauailinge
conferers in this supposed assembly at Amsterdame are by this rules condemned
being all private persons for entermedlige the^ selfs with this matter of
succession touching the title of a king. Fourthly the state of monarchy
vvhiehe thies two lawyers do confess and acknovvledge to be of al other
forms of government most excele^t and perfect in it self, must needs be most
contemptible, imperfect, and infamous of all other because the Ciuilian so
esteems the tenure of a Crown to be most irreguler, and most
extraordinary, for the Ciuilians opinion is the sentence of all thies
conferrers, and to be irreagler and extraordinarye is to be under no rule nor
order, vvher upon consequently the king holds his Crown by no rule nor
order, and is of hiselse irregular not subject to rule or order; And if the
common wealth be theonely Judge over the king to co^ptrol him as thies men
teach us, and none is by their Doctrine appointed nor allowed to comptroll
the common vvealths sentence, the^ it must needs follow, that the common
wealth in this case is also under no will nor order, and no meruail for a
multitude without a head, or of many heads none good, what is it but a chaos
and confused mass ovvt of al order: Thus we are taught that the unruly must
rule the unruly, if an irregular and disordered multitude must govern the most
irregular and exrraordinarie Crown as these men term it: Nay by this
doctrine, an usurper, disseizer intruder, impious tyrant, or infidel once
admitted by the common wealth must not be deposed: Again a possession only
must guide the right as the most material point to lead thin heritance and
succession of a Crown; two assertio^sneuer allowed for good plees in any
law spiritual or temporal, Divine or humain, and most vvorthie of ovvt claps,
with hisses and vvhistles, yet they must both be allowed and mai^teined under
this general maxim of admission.

And so all enormities must be straight rules, vvronges must be rights,
violence must be law, bad must be good, and good must be bad, if thies be
allowed and admitted by a multitude drawn to gether any way to represe^t
and bear the name of a republic or common stat, which for cleanelye
conueyhance of a fovvl thing in a fair hand kerchife, thies men do call a
common wealth: a special fallacy to abuse the simple; besides every
lavvfull king is deposible for or without cause, if the common wealth dislike
him: and every quarrel is a sufficient cause to depose a king if the common
wealth so esteem it, and every king shall be accounted a tyrant, an hereticque,
an infidel, or incapable othervvays and unfit, and consequently deposible,
because the public state here called a common wealth holds him so to be and
is theonlye Judge of all causes in this case of a kings state and of all
co^misions that must proceed from a king, for no other Judge is appointed in
thies men's text, A plain contradiction to their own Doctrine, and an error
that thies lavvers will not stand to if they be pressed to answer by
authority authentic. More over it must follow, upon thies men's Doctrine that
every multitude so incorporated, as they got the style and title of a public
state in their own consceit by pretense, may rightly be called a common
wealth habled by law to inioye all the preuileges before mentioned, though
they want a head, yea thovvgh no wealth nor commodity common or private be by
them maintened; And that every public stat or such common wealth as they
have allowed, may at their pleasure alter change and innouat the caur se of
inheritance and succession to the Crown, so as they may bar the right and
true title all redye cast upon any person, by the laws of the same state,
though the same person be no member of the same state, nor subject there unto
by nature, submissio^, or other lavvful means. Consequently that the ki^ge of
spain is bovvnde to setle his conscience and not impugn the ordinance of the
now English common wealth, how just so ever his title be for the present, or
future time, nor to examine any others title allowed and admitted by the same
common wealth, if that negative pregnant foisted in to the margent touching
private men can not be hable to co^ptroll the text which binds every man
without exception or difference of private or public. And last of all it is
set down in plain terms, that every king holds his Crown by the good
will of his common wealth as by the only lavvfull and good tenur of a
Crown, A plain contradiction A king is but tenant at vvil of the people.
to the state of inheritance, and an absurdity vvorthie to have all manner of
scorn and moquerye, never auuoched for any plea, never mentioned in any book,
roll, or record or vvritting of wise man, nor admited in to the thought or
imagination of any law maker, lawyer, or other me^indued with common sense
in England, and an hiperbolical fictio against the state of Regal Ma. yet we
must beleaue it, because the Ciuilian says so, who by all thies trauailinge
opinions must be always allowed. Thus we see that by the Ciuilia^s law
his Ma. tenur vvherby he boldeth his Crown must be irregular and
extraordinary, and though he be admitted by his common wealth once settled in
his state and therefore not remouable, yet that will not serve, if he holds
his Crown as tenant at vvil of the common wealth who may revoke their
admissions when they vst to find such cause as they think sufficient, and
consequently he has no state of inheritance nor succession, what would the
king Catholic say to this think you, if he were well informed of this
particular? Nay what they of holande and zelande vvil presume, here on to
think and say for hardeninge their hearts, and mainteyninge their actual
rebellions, every man sees and his Ma. can not be ignorant; Therefore it is not
like that he was privy to the contents of this book so far as to allow of
it here his Ma. may behold the blind presu^ptio^ of thies statists who dare
thus confront his Ma. in the chiefest point of his Maiestical state, with such
indignities, by abusinge all regal dignity so lovv as to make it the vassal

the sacred state of a king against all popularitye It is not to be doubted
that either his late Ma. wisdom would be so unmindful as to vvink at
such popular preso^ption. or that his most gracious nature would permit the
pains and good vvilles of such vvritters to be requited for any scorn full
libell put forth under the protection of his late Ma. (specially times
standinge as they did then.) Nevertheless though some have written in defense
of Kings and kingly state and given them more immunityes privileges or
prerogatives then good kings vvil claim, or good common vvealths are bovvnde
to yield, yet that excuses not these commen wealth me^ to straye so far forth
out of the right way, as to engrosse their bad vvays by private monopoles and
franchesies in prejudice of Royal fredome and common good of all for I am sure
that many have vvritte^ apologies touching that subject very laudable upon
good assertions and propositions with limitations, exceptions and allovva^ces,
al allowable by law of reason and conscience yea most beneficial to whole
and sovvnd common vvealths, but quite opposite to the general pro positions and
assertions of these lawyers laid down for the surmised authorities and their
broken common vvealths, such as they have exemplified as patterns to be
followed.

But this proceedinge of these lawyers is not all that was to disli^ke the
late ki^ge or this living, for albeit this author that carries upon his
shoulders all the parties named in the said libel vvoulde make the late king
believe that all tytles being doutfull his force and might should bear away
the Crown of England for him self or theinfante his daughter, and to
facilitat this course made diverse seminaryes priests in spain that vve^t
into england by threats or fair means to subscribe that in their
conferences there by all possible means, they should advance the pretense of
the said infant: yet since that time some of his dependents with his priuitie
practiced the aduau^cement of the late earl of Darby an heretic to the
Crown of England, This author and lawyer mock and abuse the king of spain.
which wrought his vntimelye death as many say, and besides after this he him
self vvrotte a discour se which was sent into England and published to many
of the best Catholics there that he vvoulde vvishe and advise them when the
commodity served that they should make an election of some principal noble
English Catholic to be their King, so that the late King, might have seen
if he hade lived, what affection and respect this author carried either to him
or his daunghters title or there persons, for that as nevve inuentio^s and
co^ceipts came in to his head, he would frame such new titles and covvrses
as would best fit the mark he shot at for his particular profit and
aduaunceme^t, which if the late King had lived would have been a sufficient
vvarni^ge to him for ever being abused by the said author any more, and no
doubt will bread the same effect with the king present and his sister the
infant, when they shall know thus much.

And as you may herby see plainly with what reason the king of spain and
all monarchs in general are to find them selves grieved with these lawyers
for the little respect they have to Regal and kingly authority which kings
are for their saftie to provide for, so is there none more toched to the
quick by thies lawyers and aucthor then the kings Ma. The authors extreme
malice against the king of scotland.
of Scotland, nor whom they desire to be more defaced touching his person
and Right then he, for then they do as it were assure them selves, that all
their drifts and practices would have such issue as they vvish with outlet
or empeschement.

VVherin first their malice is greatly to be taxed that seake to ruyn and
overthrow a king that never did any of them hurt, but contrariwise has so
far favored sum of the authors function, that in delivering them from danger
of their lives, he hazarded him selse for the same, as the parties them selves
can not deny if they be asked, besides the favor that he has shevved to some
Catholics, and has never used persecution against any vnelest it be against
sum very fevve that have been discovered to deal in some practices which
he thought might be dangerous at that time to his person and state.

Secondely their arrogance is great in that they will determine where the
right of the Crown of england avvght to be, and vvoulde have every one to
follow the same, when they dare not auouche their names, being ashamed to
justify their ignorance in the common laws of the realm and Crown of
England and Genealogies by the which the right is to be tried, if there were
any doubt of the king of Scotlandes, and yet nevertheless they vvoulde have
their sayings and courses to disanulle and anichilate the manifest and
known Right before all others which The king of Scottlande has to the
Crown of England due to him first by the quiet possesio^ his Ancesters for
diverse hu^drethe years have had from vvhe^ce he is first liniallye descended,
next for that he is in the first place also by the same mean and vvayes that
the pretendors whom this libeller sets down, vvoulde advance them
selves, and if need be can lavvfully and justly derive him self a title long
time before them all to the Crown of England, And lastly, for confirmation of
the same kings right to be the truest and perfectest of all other without
exception Sr. Nicolas Saunders that was lord Chief Baron of thexchequer in
England Sr. Antonye Brown that was lord Chief Justice of the commen
pleas. Mr. Carell called the father of the Iavve attorney for the Queens Ma. of
the Duchye, and Mr. Edmonde Ployden, which were very virtuous wise and most
famous me^ for their knowledge in the laws of the realm and Crown of
England as the like has not been for many years, did with out doubt and
difficulty sincerely and plainly resolve and determine that the late Queen
of Scotla^de was next heir apparent to the Realm and Crown of England,
who was his Ma. Mother, and so consequently she diinge, her heirs were to
succeed, who debated this point with the advice of the best Heraults of
England that could be fovvnde, and had also the opinions of the vviser and
skilfuller sort of the Realm that did accord with them: yet notvvistanding
all this, this ignorant author and lawyers without name neither understanding
the laws of England nor skillful in genealogies, vvoulde have their
friuoulous and rediculous reasons to be of more ualour and credit then these a
fore rehearsed. Lastly thies lawyers and other are to be noted of great
presumption and disobedience that with out the authority or vvarrant of This
author preoccupi ethe the office of a Pope.
their superiou's, and specially of his holiness and others his predecessors
upon vvho^ they ought chefly to rely dare overthrow and make kings form
and frame common vvealths after their pleasures and fancyes, as though they
were the superious upon whom Pope and all persons of what qualitye so ever
are to depe^de, and from whom al persons are to receive and take their
directions for spiritual and temporal affairs, which how great an
absurditye it is for the^ to think that all wise me^ do not see their rash
folishe and dangerous courses, whereunto they pretend does argue there
insolenty, and pride so much to blind their Judgment, as that they see not
how their devises and drifts will be vvhoped and hallowed out of all men's
conceits that be indifferent and that would have their Country kept from
tyranny and spoil of ancient nobility, laws costumes and privileges,
which is that it seems these masqued author and lawyers most desiere.

And it seems strange to wise and virtuous people that this author This
author refusethe to take his holiness for an example.
and disguised lawyers making show to be Catholics, and to advance gods
cause follow not the pattern and example of his holiness and predecessors who
have ever held mild and modest courses toward the king of Scotla^de,
most aggreable to the Apostolic, Roman Catholic church, which is a
svvete Mother esteeminge it the best and rediest way to dravve and gain
such princes to the right and true religion as be out of the said Church
specially not of malice but by Education, And yet these fantastical Aucthor
and lawyers would have all violente and furious courses exercised against the
said King, As deprivation of his own realm and right to the Crown of
England, yfit lay in their power Though they see by daily experience that
both princes and other particular persons of great qualitye that fall from
theCatholicke Church being once in it, and were accounted as desperate
persons for ever returninge, yet since have reconsiled them selves with great
repentance and have done notable services by their examples, in procuring and
hasteninge others of principal rank to be reconsiled, as namely the most
Christian king of france has done, for the which he deserves immortal
fame. And therefore since God has given his grace, that such remember to
return to the right way that were strayed forth of the same, as also has
called and does call daily infinite nombers that have been borne and bred up in
heresy, in many places and specially in France, vvher of late have been
reco^siled to the Catholic church, as it were many whole to vvnes and
cities of people, and that which is gteatlie and miraculouslie to be noted,
the chief occasion and instruments hereof to be by three persons converted to
the Catholic faith, that vuere in their kind and quality the most sharpest
and bitterest enemies against the Catholic cause, that is to say, the kings
Ma. of France that now is a most mighty Prince, the bishop of Eureux a very
learned Prelate, and Monsieur saint Marye a gentilman of great respect
wherefore should these uncharitable No cause to esteem the king of scotland
desperate to be reconcyled to the true Caetholicke church as these lawyers
would have the world to think.
aucthor and lavvers condemn the king of Scottlande as desperate to reconsile
him self to the true church, since besides that which has been said of his
Ma. he never shevved him self vvillfull and obstinate in any of his actions
but governs him self with that wisdom, clemencye, liberalitye, and
affabi litye withdraw other singular natural and moral parts which God has
given him that gains him great renovvme, and gi ueth great contentement to
them that know him.

And it is very like that God who has bestovved these notable parts upon
his Ma will not refuse him the grace that may make him know God and be best
for his souls health demandinge the same as he ought to do, and as upon good
consideration and conference if he will accept the same he may do and hereunto
no doubt will he be the better incited when he shall think that it is he
only of his race that svvarueth from the Catholic Religion in which all his
noble and Princely progenitors have lived and died, And specially his most
sacred mother who sealed the same at her death with her bludde for the
which she is a Martyr, and by the means vvherof he is a Martyrs son,
which passes the dignitye of a king or any other vvorldly title, And lastly
when his Ma. shall here, how disceatfully and falslye Plessey Morney did
allege so many hundred places and passages of the doctors and others to
maintain his wicked doctrine, which being manifestly discovered in his own
presence a fore indifferent Judges of Catholics, and of his ovvnne Religion,
and now known to all the world, have procured hi perpetual shame, and have
made many since that tymevvhich accounted him as one of the chief heddes and
learnednest ofther religion, to leave him and to yealde them selves to the
obedience of the catholic church. And therefore since there is not
desperation of the kings Ma. of Scotlandes acknovvledginge the true Church,
this auctor with his lawyers may see what gross and foul errors they
commit, that will not let God work his will who has the hearts of Princes
in his hands, but will take upon them, by speeches writings and practices,
to Censure of his said Ma. in the vvorst sense that may be to the tuine of his
honor and title to the Crown of England, because he does not just at that
time as they would have hi follow their pleasures and directions, Though his
Holiness and his predecessors have been and are contented to sit still, and be
silent, without doing any thing against his Ma. and have rejected all
informations which I have herd of credit this author or sum of his
associats have caused to be given to his Holiness or some about him to procure
an excomunication against his Ma. And herin it is to be noted, that his Holiness
and predecessors procedinges and actions ar governed and directed with ane
other manner of spirit, wisdom, and discretion then those lawyers have been
and that they had and have their scope and end cheiffye to advance Gods glory
and the true Church, with out shovvinge fantastical humors passion and
partiallitye as this auctor and his lawyers have done and do: And let them not
think how smothely and svvhiftly so ever they hope to run away with
their driftes and devises, and that they would seem to dance in a net in
such sort that no man should mark and find their subtiltyes and craste,
but that they be espied and clearly seen, And that when opportunitye serves
(which perhaps will not be long thereunto) they will be met with all by
those that are most interessed, and that the name of the aucthor of the book
of tytles, with his odious practices shall be presented to his Holiness, and
secunded with such manifest profes as neither his accustomed cauillations,
equivocations, nor doblinge will or shall serve for his purgation, but only
simple and plain dealing must be shevved, and than it shall appear, whether
princes and others have just cause to be grieved and offended or no, and
whether this author meriteth not to be chastised and commanded to retire him
self from meddlinge farther in matters of state, vviche shall be best for the
public good and his soulthes health.
