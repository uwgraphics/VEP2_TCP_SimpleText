Cum Priuilegio.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable George, Marquess of Buckingham, Viscount Villiers,
Barron of Whaddon, Master of his Majesty's Horse, Knight of the most noble
Order of the Garter, Gentleman of his Majesty's Bedchamber, and one of his
most honorable Privy COUNCIL.
Right Honorable:
SO infinite is Love in operation, and so forcible are the faculties of the
Soul, as beside mute respects of duty and service, they will never rest
without real remonstrance of actual fruits, which I (my right noble Lord)
having been an individual appendant of your no less noble Mothers house and
name, and a religious obseruant of your own heroique and hopeful virtues,
from your Cradle, do humbly present as a tribute of my devotion, to your
favorable entertainment and protection, these few Songs, whereof some were
composed in your tender years, and in your most worthy Fathers house, (from
whom, and your most honorable Mother, for many years I received part of my
means and liuelyhoode) which has the rather emboldened me, with many other
more near respects, to entreat your Honor to let them pass under your
gracious favor, as the most noble and truest favorite of this our too much
unrespected quality. This is but a small testimony to parallel the proportion
of my mind in this kind, or any other service which my faculty and fortune
are any way able to afford: But knowing your honorable disposition to accept
the meanest service proceeding from so loyal and faithful a heart, I make no
doubt of your Lordships acceptance. On which hope relying, with all humility
craving pardon for my bold presumption, I present them, and will ever pray to
God for your health, honor, and happiness, and rest, great Marquess

Happy to be the Servant of your commands, THOMAS VAVTOR.

In commendation of the Author.
THy pleasant notes with sweet concents ygilt,
Thy Wit, thy Art, and faithful zeal discover;
Great pity 'twere such numbers should be spilt,
Or Envy should in darkness Virtue smother:
But thou have chose, good Thom, a Patron fit,
That will defend thee, and safe conduct it.
Calophysus.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable George, Marquess of Buckingham, Viscount Villiers,
Barron of Whaddon, Master of his Majesty's Horse, Knight of the most noble
Order of the Garter, Gentleman of his Majesty's Bedchamber, and one of his
most honorable Privy COUNCIL.
Right Honorable:
SO infinite is Love in operation, and so forcible are the faculties of the
Soul, as beside mute respects of duty and service, they will never rest
without real remonstrance of actual fruits, which I (my right noble Lord)
having been an individual appendant of your no less noble Mothers house and
name, and a religious obseruant of your own heroique and hopeful virtues,
from your Cradle, do humbly present as a tribute of my devotion, to your
favorable entertainment and protection, these few Songs, whereof some were
composed in your tender years, and in your most worthy Fathers house, (from
whom, and your most honorable Mother, for many years I received part of my
means and liuelyhoode) which has the rather emboldened me, with many other
more near respects, to entreat your Honor to let them pass under your
gracious favor, as the most noble and truest favorite of this our too much
unrespected quality. This is but a small testimony to parallel the proportion
of my mind in this kind, or any other service which my faculty and fortune
are any way able to afford: But knowing your honorable disposition to accept
the meanest service proceeding from so loyal and faithful a heart, I make no
doubt of your Lordships acceptance. On which hope relying, with all humility
craving pardon for my bold presumption, I present them, and will ever pray to
God for your health, honor, and happiness, and rest, great Marquess

Happy to be the Servant of your commands, THOMAS VAVTOR.

In commendation of the Author.
THy pleasant notes with sweet concents ygilt,

That will defend thee, and safe conduct it.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable George, Marquess of Buckingham, Viscount Villiers,
Barron of Whaddon, Master of his Majesty's Horse, Knight of the most noble
Order of the Garter, Gentleman of his Majesty's Bedchamber, and one of his
most honorable Privy COUNCIL.
Right Honorable:
SO infinite is Love in operation, and so forcible are the faculties of the
Soul, as beside mute respects of duty and service, they will never rest
without real remonstrance of actual fruits, which I (my right noble Lord)
having been an individual appendant of your no less noble Mothers house and
name, and a religious obseruant of your own heroique and hopeful virtues,
from your Cradle, do humbly present as a tribute of my devotion, to your
favorable entertainment and protection, these few Songs, whereof some were
composed in your tender years, and in your most worthy Fathers house, (from
whom, and your most honorable Mother, for many years I received part of my
means and liuelyhoode) which has the rather ^mboldened me, with many other
more near respects, to entreat your Honor to let them pass under your
gracious favor, as the most noble and truest favorite of this our too much
unrespected quality. This is but a small testimony to parallel the proportion
of my mind in this kind, or any other service which my faculty and fortune
are any way able to afford: But knowing your honorable disposition to accept
the meanest service proceeding from so loyal and faithful a heart, I make no
doubt of your Lordships acceptance. On which hope relying, with all humility
craving pardon for my bold presumption, I present them, and will ever pray to
God for your health, honor, and happiness, and rest, great Marquess

Happy to be the Servant of your commands, THOMAS VAVTOR.

In commendation of the Author.
THy pleasant notes with sweet concents ygilt,
Thy Wit, thy Art, and faithful zeal discover;
Great pity 'twere such numbers should be spilt,
Or Envy should in darkness Virtue smother:
But thou have chose, good Thom, a Patron fit,
That will defend thee, and safe conduct it.
