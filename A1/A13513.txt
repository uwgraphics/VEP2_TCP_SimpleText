Grecian Latinist, or Latin Grecian Orator, the Odcombyan Deambulator,

MOst worthy Sir, as Quintilian in his Apothegmes to the naked, learned,
Gimnosophists of AEthiopia, very wittily says, Potanto Machyo corbatio
monomosco kayturemon Lescus, Ollipuff tingere whingo: which is, knowledge is a
main Antithesis to ignorance, and pains and travel is the high way to
experience. I being therefore well acquainted with the generous vrbanity
innated or rooted in your humanity, (in these days of vanity,) I dedicate (out
of my affability, debility, ability, imbecility, facility, or agility,) this
poor Pamphlet to your nobility, in all seruility and humility: not doubting
but the fluent fecundity of your wisdoms profundity, in your heads rotundity,
will conserve, reserve, preserve, and observe, what I and my industrious labors
deserve. I do (out of mine own cognition) auerre and abett, that he is
senseless that will assent, that the Fates did assign, with their whole
assistance, that any should aspire, to be an associate in any assembly, boldly
to assimulate, assay, assault, or ascribe to any mortal but your self,
superlatiue maiority or transcendency for travels, observations, and oratorie.
These things being reuolued and ruminated, in the sagacitie or acuteness of my
Pericranion, I imagined that no man under the Cope was more worthy then your
self to be a Patronizing Poplar to shelter my poor reed-like endeavors.
Howsoever in the preterlapsed occurrences there has been an Antagonisticall
repugnancy betwixt us, yet I hope time and travel has worn it threadbare, or
brought it to a most irrecouerable consumption; withal I know you are
incapable of inexpugnable malice, inueterate malignancy or emulation. I protest
tongue-tide taciturnity should have imprisoned this work in the Lethargicall
dungeon, or bottomless Abisse of euersleeping oblivion, but that I am
confident of your patronage and acceptance, which if it fall out (not according
to any Promerits of mine) but out of mine own expectation of your matchles and
vnparalelld disposition, I shall hereafter sacrifice whole Hecatombs of
invention both in Prose and Verse, at the shrine of your vnfellowed and
vnfollowed virtues. So wishing more to see you then to hear from you, because
writers want work, and the Press is turned voluntary through the scarcity of
employments, which I hope your presence will supply, I pray that Neptune,
AEolus, Tellus, Bacchus, and all the watery, windy, earthly, and drinking
Deities may be officious, auspicious, and delicious unto you, humbly imploring
you to take in good part this my sophistical, paradoxicall, submission, with a
mental reservation of my love and service, to sympathize or be equivalent to
your kind liking and corroborated affecting.

He that has a poor muse to trot in your service with all obsequious
observance: JOHN TAILOR.

Three weeks, three days, and three hours travels and Observations. OR,
TAILORS TRAVELS.
SAturday the 17. of August, 1616. (after I had taken leave of some friends
that would hardly give me leave to leave them) I was associated with five or
six courteous Comrades to the Haven of Billingsgate, where I was no sooner
come, but I was shipped in a wherry for the port of Graues-end, and having two
women and three men in my company thither, we past the way away by telling
tales by turns. Where one of the women took upon her very Logically to defend
the honesty of Brokers, and she maintained her Paradoxicall Arguments so
pithily, as if her self like a desperate pawn had layen seven years in
Lauender on sweetning in long Lane, or amongst the dogged inhabitants of
Houndsditch. And one of the men replied that he thanked God he never had any
need of them, whereupon I began to suspect him to be a crafty knave, because
the Proverb says, A crafty knave needs no broker, and indeed after I had
enquired what countriman he was, he told me he was a Welsh man, and a Justices
Clarke. I left him as I found him, hoping never to be troubled with his binding
over, and withdrawing: and so landing at Graues-end, we all went to the
Christopher where we took a Bachanalian farewell one of another, where I
remained till the Monday following, awayting the coming down of the ship that
I was to be transported in. About the hour of three in the afternoon, with
good hope we weighed Anchor, and with a courteous tide and a gentle wind we
sailed down the river of Thames, as far as the grand Oyster haven of
Quinborough, where though our ship was not Sea-sicke, yet she cast, (Anchor I
mean.)

On the morrow, being Tuesday, we weighed, and with the friendly breath of
Zephirus, alias a Western wind, our sails being swollen, our ship called the
Judith, who with her stern cut the liquid mounting mountains of Neptunes
wavering territories, as nimbly as Hebrew Judith beheaded Holofernes, so that
by the bountiful favor of him that rules both Winds and Seas, on the
Thursday following we espied the coast of Freezeland, and the next day we
sailed by an Island called the Holy Land, which may be called the Land of
Lobsters, or the Country of Crabs for the plenty of those kind of crawling
creatures that are taken there. But we, taking time by the fore-top, let no
advantage slip, but with a merry Gale, and a friendly flood, on the Friday we
sailed up the River of Elue, as far as Stoad, where we Anchoured till the
morrow, being Saturday, and the feast of S. Bartholmew the Apostle, we arrived
at a bleake alias, a town an English mile from Hamburgh, called Altonagh,
which is so called by the Hamburgers because it stands all-too-nigh them for
their profit, being inhabited with diverse tradesmen which do hinder their
freedom. I was no sooner landed there, but my company and my self went to a
Dutch drinking-schoole, and having vpsefreez'd four pots of boon beer as
yellow as gold, our host said we had four shilling to betall, or to pay, which
made me suspect it to be a bawdy house by his large reckoning, till at last I
understood that the shillings he meant were but stiuers, or three half pence
a piece. So this terrible shot being discharged (which in the total amounted
to the sum of sixepence English,) we departed toward Hamburgh, where by the
way I noted some 20. men, women, and children in diverse places of Altonagh, all
deformed, some with one eye, some with hare-lips, crook backed, splay footed,
halfe-nozed, or one blemish or other. I admiring at them, was told they were
all Jews, wherein I perceived the Judgment of the high Judge of all, that had
permitted Nature to deforme their forms, whose Graceless minds were so much
misshapen through want of Grace.

But I being entered the City of Hamburgh on the Saturday, I was presently
conducted to the English house, where I found a kind Host, an honest hostess,
good company, store of meat, more of drink, a true Tapster, and sweet lodging.
And being at dinner, because I was a stranger, I was promoted to the chiefest
place at the Table, where to observe an old custom, every man did his best
endeavor to hauns me for my welcome, which by interpretation is to give a man a
loaf too much out of the Brewers basket; in which kind of Potshot, our
English are grown such stout Proficients, that some of them dares bandy and
contend with the Dutch their first teachers. But after they had hanced me as
well as they could, and I pleased, they administered an oath to me, in manner
and form as follows; Laying my hand on a full pot

I swear by these contents, and all that is herein contained, that by the
courteous favor of these Gentlemen, I do find my self sufficiently hanced,
and that henceforth ever I shall acknowledge it; and that whenever I shall
offer to be hanced again, I shall arm my self with the craft of a Fox, the
manners of a Hog, the wisdom of an Ass, mixed with the ciuility of a Bear.
This was the form of the oath, which as near as I can shall be performed on
my part; and here is to be noted that the first word a Nurse or a Mother does
teach her children if they be males, is Drink, or Beer: So that most of them
are transformed to Barrels, Firkins, and Kinderkins, always freight with
Hamburgh beer.

And though the City is not much more then half the bigness as London is within
the walls, yet are there in it almost 800. Brewhouses, and in one day there
has been shipped away from thence, 337. brewings of Beer, besides 13 or 14.
brewings have been wrackt or stayed in the town, as not sufficient to be
bezelled in the Country.

The Saturday being thus past, and Sunday come, I went toward the English
Church, where I observed many shops open, buying and selling, chopping and
changing of all manner of wares, with the streets furnished with Apples,
Pears, Plums, Nuts, Grapes, or any thing else that an ordinary Market can
afford, as commonly as if the Sabbath were but a bare ceremony without a
Commandment. In which I note the Jews in their execrable superstition, to be
more devout and obseruant, then these Pedlars in their profession; for on the
Saturday (being the Jews Sabbath) they neglect all humane affares* and betake
themselves irreligiously to their misbeleeuing faithless religion.

The Sermon being ended at the English Church, I walked in the afternoon with
a friend of mine, (an Inhabitant of the Town) to see and to be seen, where at
one of the gates was placed a strong guard of Soldiers with Muskets, Pikes,
Halberts, and other warlike accoutrements, I asked the cause, and I was
informed it was because of the building of certain new mounts and Bulwarks,
which were partly erected without the old wall: And when I perceived these
fortifications, I was amazed, for it is almost incredible for the number of men
and horses that are daily set on work about it, besides the work it self is
so great that it is past the credit of Report, and as I suppose will prove
most inexpugnable and invincible Rampires to strengthen the Town on that side
against the inuasiue attempts of the greatest Monarke that should assail them.

But after much musing, walking further toward the fields, I espied four or
five pretty parcels of modesty go very friendly into a counsellhouse by the
ways side, as we and thousands of people used to pass; they were handsome
young Girls of the age of 18. or 20. years a piece, and although they had a
door to shut, yet they knowing their business to be necessary and natural,
sat still in loving and neighbourly manner: so having traced a turn or two,
we returned into the Town again, and entering a long Garden within the walls,
some of the Townes-men were shooting for wagers at a mark with their muskets:
some bowling: some at slide-thrift, or shouellboord: some dancing before a
blind fiddler and his cowbellied, dropsy, durty drabb: some at one game, some
at another, most of them drinking, and all of them drunk, that though it was a
Sabbath, which should wholly be dedicated to God, yet by the abuse of these
bursten-gutted bibbers, they made it an afternoon consecrated, or more truly
execrated to the service of hell, and to the great amplification of the Devils
kingdom.

When Christians dare Gods Sabbath to abuse,
They make themselves a scorn to Turks and Jews:
You stealing Barabasses beastly Race,
Rob God of glory, and your selves of Grace.
Think on the supreme Judge who all things tries,
When Jews in Judgment shall against you rise.
Their feigned truth, with fervent Zeal they show,
The Truth vnfeign'd you know, yet will not know.
Then at the Bar in new Jerusalem,
It shall be harder much for you then them.
But leaving them to their drunken designs, I returned toward my lodging,
where by the way I saw at the common Iayle of the town, a great number of
people were clustred together, I asked the cause of their concourse, and I was
certified that there was a Prisoner to be broken upon the wheel the next day,
and that these idle Gazers did prease to gape upon him for want of better
employments, I being as inquisitiue after novelties, as a Traveler of my small
experience might be, enquired earnestly the true cause of the next days
execution: my friend told me that the Prisoner was a poor Carpenter dwelling
in the Town, who lately having stolen a Goose, and plucking it within his
doors, a little Girl, (his daughter in Law) went out of his house, and left
the door open, by which means, the owner of the Goose passing by, espied the
wretched thief very diligently picking what he before had been stealing, to
whom the owner said; Neighbor I now perceive which way my Geese use to go,
but I will have you in question for them, and so away he went: the Caitife
being thus reproved grew desperate, and his child coming into his house; ye
young whore, quoth he, must ye leave my door open for folks to look in upon
me? and with that word, he took a Hatchet, and with a fatal cursed stroke,
he cloue the childs head: for the which murder he was condemned and judged to
be broaken alive upon the wheel. Close to the Iayle I espied a house of free
stone, round and flat roofed, and leaded, upon the which was erected the true
picture of a most unmatchable Hangman; and now I am entered into a discourse of
this brave abject, or subject, you must understand that this fellow is a merry,
a mad and a subsidy hangman, to whom our Tyburne Tatterdemallian, or our
Wapping windpipe-stretcher, is but a Raggamuffin, not worth the hanging: for
this teare-throat Termagant is a fellow in Folio, a commander of such great
command, and of such greatness to command, that I never saw any that in that
respect could countermand him: For his making is almost past description, no
Saracens head seems greater, and sure I think his brainepan if it were
emptied, (as I think he has not much brain in it,) would well contain
half a bushel of malt, his shaggie hair and beard would stuff a Cusheon
for Charons boat, his Imbost nose and embroydered face, would furnish a
Ieweller; his eyes well dried, would make good Tennis-balls, or shot for a
small piece of Ordinance, his yawning mouth would serve for a Conniborrow, and
his two ragged rows of teeth, for a stone wall, or a Pale; then has he a
neck like one of Hercules his pillars, with a winde-pipe, (or rather a beer
pipe) as big as the boar of a Demiculuering, or a wooden pumpe; through
which conduit half a brewing of Hamburgh beer does run down into his
unmeasurable paunch, wherein is more midriff, guts and garbage then three
tripewiues could be able to utter before it stunke. His post-like legs were
answerable to the rest of the great frame which they supported, and to
conclude, sir Beuis, Ascapart, Gogmagog, or our English sir John Falstaff, were
but shrimpes to this bezzeling Bombards longitude, latitude, altitude, and
crassitude, for he passes, and surpasses the whole Germane multitude.

And as he is great in corpulency, so is he powerful in potency, for
figuratively he has spiritual resemblance of Romish authority, and in some
sort he is a kind of demy-Pope, for once a year in the dogge-daies he sends
out his men with bats in stead of Bulls, with full power from his greatness to
knock down all the curs without contradiction, whose masters or owners will
not be at the charge to buy a pardon for them of his mightines, which pardon is
more dureable then the Popes of wax or parchment, for his is made of a piece
of the hide of an Ox, a Horse, or such lasting stuff, which with his
stigmaticall stamp or seal is hanged about every dogs neck who is freed from
his fury by the purchase of his pardon. And sure I am persuaded that these
dogs are more sure of their lives with the hangmans pardon, then the poor
besotted blinded Papists are of their seduced souls from any pardon of the
Popes.

The privileges of this graund haulter-master are many, as he has the
emptying of all the vaults or draughts in the city, which no doubt he gains
some savor by. Besides all Oxen, Kine, Horses, Hogs, Dogs, or any such beasts,
if they dye themselves, or if they be not like to live, the hangman must
knock them on the heads, and have their skins: and whatsoever inhabitant in
his jurisdiction does any of these things aforesaid himself, is abhorred and
accounted as a villain without redemption. So that with hangings, headings,
breakings, pardoning and killing of dogs, flaying of beasts, emptying vaults,
and such privy commodities, his whole revenue sometimes amounts to 4. or 5.
hundred pounds a year. And he is held in that regard and estimation, that any
man will converse and drink with him, nay sometimes the Lords of the Town
will feast with him, and it is accounted no impeachment to their honors; for
he is held in the rank of a Gentleman, (or a rank Gentleman) and he scorns
to be clad in the cast weeds of executed offenders: No, he goes to the
Mercers, and has his Satin, his Velvet, or what stuff he pleases, measured
out by the yard or the ell, with his gould and silver lace, his silk
stockings, laced spangled garters and roses, hat and feather with four or five
brave villains attending him in Livery cloakes, who have stipendary means
from his ignominious bounty.

Monday the 19. of August, about the hour of 12. at noone, the people of the
town in great multitudes flocked to the place of execution; which is half a
mile English without the gates, built more like a sconce then a Gallows, for
it is walled and ditched about with a drawbridge, and the prisoner came on
foot with a Divine with ^im, all the way exhorting him to repentance, and
because death should not terrify him, they had given him many rowses and
carowses of wine and beer: for it is the custom there to make such poor
wretches drunk, whereby they may be senseless either of Gods mercy or their
own misery; but being prayed for by others, they themselves may die
resolutely, or (to be feared) desperately.

But the prisoner being come to the place of death, he was by the officers
delivered to the hangman, who entering his strangling fortification with two
graund hangmen more and their men, which were come from the city of Lubeck, and
another town, (which I cannot name) to assist their Hamburghian brother in
this great and weighty work: the drawbridge was drawn up, and the prisoner
mounted on a mount of earth, built high on purpose that the people without may
see the execution a quarter of a mile round about: four of the hangmans men
takes each of them a small halter, and by the hands and the feet they hold the
prisoner extended all abroad lying on his back: then the Arch-hangman, or the
great Master of this mighty business took up a wheel, much about the bigness
of one of the fore wheels of a Coach: and first having put off his doublet,
his hat, and being in his shirt as if he meant to play at tennis, he took the
wheel, and set it on the edge, and turned it with one hand like a top or a
whirigigg, then he took it by the spoaks, and lifting it up with a mighty
stroke he beat one of the poor wretches legs in pieces, (the bones I mean)
at which he rored grievously; then after a little pawse he breaks the other
leg in the same manner, and consequently breaks his arms, and then he stroke
four or five maine blows on his breast, and burst all his bulk and chest in
shiuers, lastly he smoate his neck, and missing, burst his chin and jaws to
mammocks; then he took the broken mangled corpse, and spreads it on the
wheel, and thrusts a great post or pile into the Naue or hole of the wheel,
and then fixed the post into the earth some six foot deep, being in height
above the ground, some ten or twelve foot, and there the carcass must lie
till it be consumed by allconsuming time, or ravening fowls.

This was the terrible manner of this horrid execution, and at this place are
twenty posts with those wheels, or pieces of wheels, with heads of men nailed
on the top of the posts, with a great spike driven through the skull. The
several kinds of torments which they inflict upon offenders in those parts,
makes me to imagine our English hanging to be but a flea-biting.

Moreover, if any man in those parts are to be beheaded, the fashion is, that
the Prisoner kneeles down, and being blinded with a Napkin, one takes hold of
the hair of the crown of the head, holding the party upright, whilst the
hangman with a backward blow with a sword will take the head from a man's
shoulders so nimbly, and with such dexterity, that the owner of the head shall
never miss the want of it. And if it be any man's fortune to be hanged for
never so small a crime, though he be mounted whole, yet he shall come down in
pieces, for he shall hang till every joint and limb drop one from another.

They have strange torments and varieties of deaths, according to the various
nature of the offenses that are committed: as for example, he that countersets
any Princes coin, and is proved a Coyner, his judgment is to be boiled to
death in oil, not thrown into the vessel all at once, but with a pully or a
Rope to be hanged under the Armepits, and let down into the oil by degrees:
first the feet, and next the legs, and so to boil his flesh from his bones
alive. For those that set houses on fire wilfully, they are smoked to death, as
first there is a pile or post fixed in the ground, and within an English Ell of
the top of it is a piece of wood nailed cross, wherepuon the offender is made
fast sitting, then over the top of the post is whelmed a great tub or Dryfat,
which does cover or ouerwhelme the prisoner as low as his middle. Then
underneath the executioner has wet straw, hay, stubble, or such kind of
stuff, which is fired, but by reason it is wet and danke, it does not burn but
smolder and smoke, which smoke ascends up into the tub where the Prisoners
head is, and not being able to speak, he will heave up and down with his
belly, and people may perceive him in these torments to live three or four
hours,

Adultery there, if it be proved, is punished with death, as the loss of
both the parties heads, if they be both married, or if not both, yet the the
married party must dye for it, and the other must endure some easier
punishment, either by the purse or carcass; which in the end proves little
better then half a hanging.

But as after a tempest a calm is best welcome; so I imagine it not amiss
after all this tragical harsh discourse, to sweeten the Readers pallat with a
few Comicall reports which were related unto me, wherein, if I seem fabulous,
it must be remembered that I claim the privilege of a traveler, who has
authority to report all that he hears and sees, and more too. I was informed
of a fellow that was hanged somewhat near the high way, within a mile or two
of Collein, and the fashion being to hang him with a halter and a chain, that
when the haulter is rotten with the weather, the carcass drops a butten hole
lower into the chain. Now it fortuned that this fellow was executed on a
winters afternoon toward night, and being hanged, the chain was shorter then
the halter, by reason whereof he was not strangled, but by the gamming of the
chain which could not slip close to his neck, he hanged in great torments
under the Jaws, it happened that as soon as he was trust up, there fell a
great storm of rain and wind, whereupon all the people ran away from the
Gallows to shelter themselves. But night being come, and the moon shining
bright, it chanced that a Country Boore, or a waggoner and his Son with him
were driving their empty wagon by the place where the fellow was hanged, who
being not choked, in the extremity of his pains did stir his legs and
writhe and crumple his body, which the waggoners Son perceived, and said;
Father look, the man upon the Gallows does move: quoth the old man he moves
indeed, I pray thee let us make have, and put the Wagon under the Gibbet, to
see if we can vnhang and save him. This being said was quickly done, and the
wretch half dead was laid in straw in the Boores wagon, and carried home,
where with good attendance he was in four or five days recovered to his
health, but that he had a cricke in his neck, and the crampe in his jaws. The
old man was glad that he had done so good a deed, (as he thought) began to
give the thief Fatherly counsel, and told him that it was Gods great mercy
toward him to make me (quoth he) the Instrument of thy deliverance, and
therefore look that thou make good use of this his gracious favor toward
thee, and labor to redeem the time thou have misspent, get thee ininto some
other Princes country, where thy former crimes may not bring thee into the
danger of the Law again, and there with honest industrious endeavors get thy
living.

The thief seemed willing to entertain these good admonitions, and thanked
the Boore and his Son, telling them that the next morning he would be gone*
and if ever his fortunes made him able, he promised to be so grateful unto
them that they should have cause to say their great courtesies were well
bestowed upon him* but all his sugared sweet promises, were in the proof but
Gall and wormwood in the performance: for this graceless Caitiffe arose
betimes in the morning, and drew on a pair of Boots and spurs which were the
man's sons of the house, and slipping out of the doors, went to the stable and
stole one of his kind hosts best horses, and away rode he. The man and his
Son, when they were up and missed the thief and the horse, were amazed at
the ingratitude of the wretch, and withal speed his son and he rode several
ways in pursuit of him, and in brief one of them took him, and brought him
back to their house again, and when it was night they bound him, and laid him
in their wagon (having deaf ears, and hardened hearts to all his entreaties)
and away to the Gallows where they found him hanging, there they with the
halter being a little shortened, they left him. The next day the Country people
wondered to see him hanging there again, for they had seen him hanged, and
missed him gone, and now to be thus strangely and privately come again in
boots and spurs, whereas they remembered at his first hanging he had shoes and
stockings, it made them muse what journey he had been riding, and what a mad
Ghest he was to take the Gallows for his Inn, or (as I suppose) for his end.

The rumor of this accident being bruited abrood, the people came far and
near to see him, all in general wondering how these things should come to
pass. At last, to clear all doubts, proclamations were published with pardon,
and a reward to any that could discover the truth, whereupon the old Boore and
Son came in and related the whole circumstance of the matter.

At another place (the hangmans place being void) there were two of the blood,
(for it is to be noted that the succession of that office does lineally descend
from the Father to the Son, or to the next of the blood) which were at strife
for the possession of this high indignity. Now it happened that two men were to
be beheaded at the same town, and at the same time, and (to avoid suite in Law
for this great prerogative) it was concluded by the Arbitrators, that each of
these new hangmen should execute one of the prisoners, and he that with
greatest cunning and slight could take the head from the body, should have the
place, to this they all agreed, and the Prisoners were brought forth, where one
of the Executioners did bind a red silk thread double about his prisoners
neck, the threads being distant one from another only the breadth of one
thread, and he promised to cut off the head with a backward blow with a sword,
between the threads. The other called his prisoner aside, and told him that if
he would be ruled by him, he should have his life saved, and besides, (quoth
he) I shall be sure to have the office. The Prisoner was glad of the motion,
and said he would do any thing upon these conditions, then said the hangman,
when thou art on thy knees, and have said thy prayers, and that I do lift up
my Axe, (for I will use an Axe) to strike thee, I will cry Hem, at which word
do thou rise and run away, (thou know none will stay thee if thou can
once escape after thou art delivered into my custody, it is the fashion of our
country) and let me alone to shift to answer the matter. This being said, or
whispered, the heads-man with the sword did cut off his prisoners head just
between the threads as he had said, which made all the people wonder at the
steadiness of his hand, and most of them judged that he was the man that was
and would be fittest to make a mad hangman of.

But as one tale is good till another be told, and as there be three degrees of
good, better, and best, so this last hangman did much exceed and ecclips the
others cunning: For his prisoner being on his knees, and he lifting up his axe
to give the fatal blow, Hem said he (according to promise) whereupon the
fellow arose and ran away, but when he had ran some seven or eight paces, the
hangman threw the axe after him, and struck his head smoothly from his
shoulders: now for all this, who shall have the place is unknown, for they are
yet in Law for it; and I doubt not but before the matter be ended, that the
lawyers will make them exercise their own trades upon themselves to end the
controversy. This tale does savor somewhat hyperbolicall, but I wish the
Reader to believe no more of the matter then I saw, and there is an end.

At another Town there stood an old ouerworne despised pair of Gallows, but
yet not so old but they will last many a fair year with good usage, but the
Townsmen a little distance from them built another pair, in a more stately
Geometrical port and fashion, whereupon they were demanded why they would be
at the charge to erect a new Gallows, having so sufficient an old one: they
answered, that those old Gallows should serve to hang fugitives and strangers;
but those new ones were built for them and their heirs for ever. Thus much for
Hangmen, Thieves, and Gallowses.

Yet one thing more for thieves: In Hamburgh those that are not hanged for
theft, are chained 2. or three together, and they must in that sort six or
seven years draw a dung-cart, and cleanse the streets of the town, and every
one of those thieves for as many years as he is condemned to that slavery, so
many bells he has hanged at an iron above one of his shoulders, and every
year a bell is taken off, till all are gone, and then he is a freeman again,
and I did see ten or twelve of these Carts, and some of the thieves had seven
bells, some 5. some 6. some one, but such a noise they make, as if all the
Devils in hell were dancing the morris.

Hamburgh is a free City, not being subject to the Emperor, or any other
Prince, but only governed by 24 Burgomasters, whereof two are the chief, who
are clled Lords, adn do hold that dignity from their first election during
their lives; The buildings are all of brick, of one uniform fashion, very
lofty and stately, it is wonderful populous, and the water with boats comes
through most of the streets of the Town.

Their Churches are most gloriously set forth, as the most of them covered with
copper, with very lofty spires, and within sides they are adorned with
crucifixes, Images and pictures, which they do charily keep for ornaments,
but not for idle or idol adoration; In Saint Jacobs and in Saint Catherines
Churches, there is in one of them a Pulpit of Alablaster, and in the other a
pair of such Organs, which for worth and workmanship are vnparalelld in
Christendom, as most travelers do relate.

The women there are no fashion-mongers, but they keep in their degrees one
continual habit, as the Richer sort do wear a Huicke, which is a robe of
cloth or stuff plaited, and the upper part of it is gathered and sowed to a
thing in the form of an English potlid, with a tassell on the top, and so put
upon the head, and the garment goes over her ruff and face if she please, and
so down to the ground, so that a man may meet his own wife, and perhaps not
know her from another Woman.

They have no Porters to bear burdens, but they have big burly-bon'd knaves
with their wives that do daily draw Carts any whether up and down the town,
with Merchants goods or any other employments: And it is reported that these
Cart-drawers are to see the rich men of the Town provided of milch-nurses for
their children, which nurses they call by the name of Ams, so that if they do
want a nurse at any time, these fellows are cursed, because they have not
gotten wenches enough with child to supply their wants.

But if a man of any fashion do chance to go astray to a house of iniquity,
the whilst he is in the house at his drudgery, another of the whores will go to
the Sherif, (which they call the Rightheere) and inform that such a man is in
such a suspected house, then is his coming forth narrowly watched, and he is
taken and brought before the Right-heere, and examined, where if he be a man of
credit, he must, and will pay forty, fifty, or sixty Rex Dollors before he
will have his reputation called in question. Of which money, the queen that
did inform shall have her reward.

A Lawyer has but a bad trade there, for any Cause or Controversy is tried
and determined in three days, Quirks, Quiddits, Demurs, Habeas Corposes,
Sursararaes, Procedendoes, or any such dilatory Law-tricks are abolished, and
not worth a button there.

But above all, I must not forget the rare actions and humors of a Quacksaluer
or Mountebanke, or to speak more familiarly, a shadow of a skillful
Chirurgian. This fellow being clad in an ancient doublet of decayed Satin,
with a Spruce Leather Ierkin with Glass buttons, the rest of his attire being
correspondent, was mounted upon a Scaffold, having shelues set with Viols,
Gallipots, Glasses, Boxes, and such like stuff, wherein as he said, were
Waters, Oils, Unguents, Emplasters, Ellectuaries, Vomits, Purges, and a world
of never heard of Drugs; and being mounted (as I said) he and his man begin to
proclaim all their skill and more, having a great number of idle and ignorant
gazers on, he began as follows (as I was informed by my Interpreter) for I
understood not one word he spoke.)

I Iacomo Compostella, Practitioner in Physic, Chyrurgery, and the
Mathematics, being a man famous through Europe, Asia, Affricke and America,
from the Oriental exaltation of Titan, to his Occidentall declination, who for
the Testimony of my skill, and the rare Cures that I have done, have these
Princes hands and seals; as first the great Cham of Tartaria, in whose Court,
only with this Water, which is the Ellixar of Henbane diafracted in a Diurnall
of ingredients Hippocratonticke, Auicenian, and Catarackt, With this did I cure
the great Duchess of Promulpho of the cramp in her tongue: and with this Oil
did I restore the Emperor Gregory Euanowich of a Convulsion in his Pericranion.
From thence I traveled through Slauonia, where I met with Mustapha Despot of
Seruia, who at that time was intolerably vexed with a Spasmus, so that it often
drove him into a Syncope with the violent obstructions of the conflagerating of
his Veins. Only with this precious Unguent being the Quintessence of Mugwort,
with Auripigmenty terragrophicated in a Limbecke of Christalline Translucency,
I recovered him to his former health, and for my reward I had a Barbary Horse
with rich Caparisons, a turkish Semitar, a Persian Robe, and 2000. Hungarian
Ducats.

Besides, here are the hands and seals of Potohamacke, Adelantado of
Prozewgma, and of Gulch Flownderscurse chief Burgomaster of Belgrade, and of
diverse Princes and estates, which to avoid tedious prolixity I omit. But good
people if you or any other be troubled with Apoplexies, Palsies, Cramps,
Lethargies, Cataracks, Quincies, Tisicks, Pleurisies, Coghs, Headaches,
Tertian, Quartan, and Quotidian Agues, burning Fevers, Iawndizes, Dropsies,
Collicks, Illiaca passio's, the Stone, the Strangury, the Pox, Plague,
Botches, Biles, Blanes, Scabs, Scurfs, Manage, Leprosies, Cankers, Megrimms,
Mumps, Fluxes, Meazels, Murreins, Gouts, Consumptions, Toothache, Ruptures,
Hernia Aquosa, Hernia Ventosa, Hernia Carnosa, or any other malladie, that
dares afflict the body of man or woman, come and buy while you may have it for
money, for I am sent for speedily to the Emperor of Trapezond about affairs
of great Importance that highly concerns his royal person.

Thus almost two hours did this fellow with embost words, and most laborious
action, talk and sweat to the people, that understood no more what he said,
then he himself understood himself. And I think his whole takings for
simple compounds did amount in the total to 9. pence sterling.

But leaving Hamburgh, (having gathered these few observations aforesaid) out
of it I went August 28. and my first iaunt of my travels was by water, to a
Town called Buckstahoo, it is a little walled Town, and stands on the other
side of the River, three miles (as they call it) from Hamburgh. The boat we
passed in is called an Iuar, not so good as a Graues-end barge, yet I think it
be as great, and the three miles longer then from London to Graues-end, for I
am sure that we were going nine hours before we could be landed: Our passage
cost us threepence a piece, and one thing I remember well, that the lazy
watermen will sit still all (or the most part of) the way, whilst their
passengers, (be they never so rich or poor, all is one to them, be they men or
women) they must row by turns, an hour or such a matter: and we landed in
the night at a place called Crants, where all the passengers were to go to
supper, but such diet we had that the Proverb was truly verified, God sent
meat, and the Devil sent Cooks; for as there was no respect of persons in the
boat, so all fellows at the Table, and all once price, the Palatine and the
Plebeian: our first mess was great platters of black broth, in shape like
new tar, and in taste Cosen Germane, to slut pottage; our second were dishes
of Eeeles, chopped as small as herbs, and the broth they were in as salt as
brine: then had we a boyld Goose, with choke pears and carrats, buried in a
deep dish; and when we demanded what was to pay, it was but three pence a
man, I mused at the cheapnesse of it, but afterward they came upon us with a
fresh reckoning of five pence a man for beer, for they never count their meat
and drink together, but bring in several reckonings for them: but the morning
being come, we hired a Boores Wagon, to carry us to a place called Citizen,
three miles there, or 12. English miles from Buckstahoo: a little bald dorp it
is, where we came about noone, and found such slender entertainment, that we
had no cause to boast of our good cheer, or our Hostess Cookery. We having*
refreshed our selves, and hired a fresh Wagon, away we went two miles further
to another Dorp called Rodonburgh, this village belongs to the Bishop of
Rodonburgh, who has a fair house there, strongly walled and deeply ditched
and moated about, very defensible, with draw-bridges, and good Ordinance. This
Bishop is a temporal Lord, notwithstanding his spiritual title; and no doubt
but the flesh preuailes above the Spirit with him; So the Bishops of Breame,
Luningburgh, and diverse other places in Germany, do very charitably take the
fleece, (for they themselves never look to the flock) by reason they use no
Ecclesiasticke function, but only in name.

Being lodged at Rodonburgh, in a stately Inn, where the Host, Hostess,
Guests, Cowes, Horses, Swine, lay all in one Room; yet I must confess their
beds to be very good, and their linen sweet, but in those parts they use no
couerlet, rugge or blanket, but a good featherbed undermost, with clean
sheets, pillowes, and pillowbeares, and another featherbed uppermost, with a
fair sheet above all, so that a man's lodging is like a woman's lying In, all
white.

August the 30. we went from Rodonburgh, and about noone we came to an old
walled town, called Feirden, it has two Churches in it, and the hangmans
statue very artificially carved in stone, and set on a high pillar, with* a rod
rampant in his hand, at this town I met with six strangers, all travelers,
where we went to dinner together all at one table, and every man opened his
knapsack or budget with victuals; (for he that carries no meat with him, many
fast by authority in most places of that country) but to note the kindness of
these people one to another, some had bread and a box of salt butter, some had
raw bacon, some had cheese, some had pickled herring, some dried beef, and
amongst the rest, I had brought three ribs of roast beef, and other provision
from Hanburgh: to conclude, we drew all like fiddlers, and fed (for the most
part) like swine for every man eat what was his own, and no man did proffer
one bit of what he had to his neighbor, so he that had cheese must dine with
cheese, for he that had meat would offer him none; I did cut every one a part
of my roast beef; which my guide told me they would not take well because it is
not the fashion of the Country: I tried, and found them very tractable to take
any thing that was good, so that I perceived their modesty to take one from
another, proceeds from their want of manners to offer. But dinner being done,
away we went over a bridge, in the midst whereof is a Iynn, made in the
likeness of a great Lantern, it is hanged on a turning Gybbet, like a Crane:
so that it may be turned on the bridge, and over the River, as they shall
please that have occasion to use it. It is big enough to hold two men, and it
is for this purpose, if any one or more do rob gardens or orchards, or
cornefields, (if they be taken) he or they are put into this same whirligigge,
or kickumbob, and the gybbet being turned, the offender hangs in this Cage over
the River some 12 or 14 foot from the water, then there is a small line made
fast to the party some 5. or 6. fadome, and with a trick which they have, the
bottom of the cage drops out, and the thief falls suddenly into the water. I
had not gone far, but at the end of the bridge I saw an old chapel, which
in old time they say was dedicated to St. Frodswicke, which has the day after
S. Luke the Evangelist: I entering in, perceived it was a charitable Chapel,
for the doors and windows were always open, by reason there were none to
shut, and it was a common receptacle for beggars and rogues. There was the
image of our Lady, with a veil over her, made (as I think) of a Bakers
bolter, and Saint Peter houlding a candle to her. I cut a piece of her Veil,
and taking Peter by the hand at my departure, the kind Image (I know not upon
what acquaintance) being loose handed, let me have his hand with me, which
being made of wood, by reason of ruinous antiquity, burst of in the handling:
which two precious relickes I brought home with me to defend me and all my
friends from sparrow blasting.

From this place we were glad to travel on foot one dutch mile to a Dorpe
called Durfurne, where we hired a Boores wagon to a town called Neinburgh, but
we could not reach thither by 2 English miles, so that we were glad to lodge in
a barn that night: On the morrow early, we arose and came to Nienburgh, which
is a little walled town, belonging to that Bishopric from whence it is so
named. There we stayed 3. hours before we could get a Wagon, at last we were
mounted to a Dorpe called Leiz, two Dutch miles; I would have bargained with
the Boore to have carried us to Dorne, which I bade my guide tell him it was
but a mile further, a mile quoth the Boore, indeed we call it no more, but it
was measured with a dog, and they threw in the tail and all to the bargain;
so to Leiz he carried us, and there we found a Wagon of Dorne homeward bound,
which made us ride the cheaper; but it was the longest mile that ever I rode or
went, for surely it is as much as some ten of our miles in England. But having
overcome it at last, from thence I took a fresh Wagon to carry me two miles
further to a town called Buckaburghe, where I had, and have, I hope, a brother
residing; to whom my journey was intended, and with whom my Perambulation was
at a period. This town of Buckaburgh is wholely and solely belonging to the
Grass or Grave of Shomburgh, a Prince of great command and eminence, absolute
in his authority and power, not countermanded by the Emperor, or any other
further then courtesy requires; and in a word, he is one of the best
accomplished Gentlemen in Europe for his person, port, and princely
magnificence. He has there to his inestimable charge, built the town, with
many goodly houses, streets, Lanes, a strong wall, and a deep ditch, all well
furnished with munition and artillery, with a band of Soldiers which he
keeps in continual pay, allowing every man a Doller a week, and double
apparel every year. Besides, he has built a stately Church, being above
120. steps to the roof, with a fair pair of Organes, a curious carved
Pulpit, and all other ornaments belonging to the same. His own Palace may
well be called an earthly Paradise, which if I should run into the praise of
the description of, I should bring my wits into an intricate Labyrinth, that I
should hardly find the way out: yet according to the imbecility of my memory,
I will only touch a little at the shadow of it, and let the substance stand
where it does.

At the front or outward gate is a most stately Arch, upon the top whereof is
erected the image of Envy, (as great as a demi Colossus) between two Dragons,
all guilt with gold; before the gate is an iron grate to open and shut as it
were of flowers or work of Embroydery, at which gate stands always a court of
Guard, and a Sentinel, and at the lower part of the Arch is the Princes title
or in Capital letters as follows; ERNESTVS, DEI GRATIA, COMES HOLST,
Scomburgh, Sternburgh, etc.

After I was entered within the outward gate, I was showed his stables, where I
saw very fair and goodly horses, both for war and other uses, amongst the
rest there was one naturally spotted like a Leopard, or Panther, and is called
by the name of Leopard, a stately courageous beast, and so formed as if Nature
had laid all her cunning aside, only to compose that Horse, and indeed I must
acknowledge that he was made for the service of some great Prince, and not for
any inferior Person.

Passing further, I came to another Court of Guard, and over a drawbridge,
into the inner court, where on the right hand, I was conducted into the
Chapel, in which Chapel, if it were possible that the hand of mortal men
(with artificial workmanship) could visibly set forth the magnificent glory
of the immortal Creator, then absolutely there it is, but being impossible so
to do, (as near as I can) I will describe it; the pauement is all of black
and gray marble, curiously wrought with Chequer-worke, the seats and pues are
carved Wainscot of wonderful cunning and workmanship: the roof is adorned
with the statues of Angels and Cherubins, many in number, all so richly
gilded, as if Gold were as plentiful as peauter, there could not be more
liberality bestowed: besides there are a fair set of Organs, with a brave
sweet Quire of Queristers: so that when they sing, the Lutes, Viols,
Bandoraes, Organs, Recorders, Sagbuts, and other musical Instruments, all
strike up together, with such a glorious delicious harmony, as if the
Angelical music of the spheres were descended into that earthly Tabernacle.
The Prince himself is a Protestant, very zealous in his Prayer, and diligent
in his attention to the Preacher, who although I understood not, yet I
perceived he was a good Divine who gravely and sincerely with reverence and
eloquent Elocution delivered the bread of life to the understanding Auditors.

In this Town I stayed with my brother from Saturday the last of August, till
the Thursday following which was the fifth of September. When I was conducted
an English mile on my way by certain of my contrymen my Lords Musicians,
where we drank and parted, only my Brother and my Guide brought me that
night to a strong walled Town called Minden, which stands on the river of
Weazer, and belongs to the Bishop of that See. On the morrow I walked to see
the Town, where I bought 36. cheeses for eight pence, and a yard and half of
pudding for five pence, which I brought into England for rarities. So about
noone we took a boat to pass down the River, which boat is much longer then
any western barge, but nothing near so broad, it was half laden with lime
and chalk, and by reason the wind blew hard, we were almost choked with the
flying and scattering of that dusty commodity. Besides the water was so
shallow, that we ran a ground 3. or 4. times, and sometimes an hour, sometimes
less before we could get a float again: which made me and my Guide go a
shore at a village called Peterhaghen, where we hired a wagon to Leize, where
we stayed all night, (being come into our old way again) where were a crew of
strowling rogues and whores that took upon them the name of Egyptians,
Iuglers and Fortune tellers, and indeed one of them held the Good-wife with a
tale, the whilst another was picking her chest, and stole out ten dollors,
which is forty shillings, and she that talked with her, looked in her hand,
and told her that if she did not take great heed, she knew by her Art that
some mischance was near her: which proved true, for her money was gone the
whilst her fortune was telling.

But I appointed a wagon over night to be ready by three of the clock in the
morning, when I arose and applied my travel so hard by changing fresh wagons,
so that that day I came as far as Rodonburgh, which was nine Dutch miles,
where I stayed that night: The next day being Sunday the eighth of September,
we took wagon toward Buckstahoo, we had a mad merry Boore, with an hundred
totters about him; and now I think it fit a little to describe these Boores,
their natures, habits, and unmannerly manners. In our English tongue the name
Bore or Boore does truly explane their swinish condition, for most of them are
as full of humanity as a Baconhogge, or a Bore, and their wives as cleanely and
and courteous as Sowes. For the most part of the men they are clad in thin
buckerom, vnlined, barelegged and footed, neither band or scarce shirt, no
woollen in the world about them, and thus will they run through all weathers
for money by the wagons side, and though no better apparrelled, yet all of
them have houses, land, or manual means to live by: The substantial Boores I
did meet above 120. of them that Sunday, with every one an hatchet in his hand,
I mused at it, and thought they had been going to fell wood that day, but my
Guide told me they were all going to Church, and that in stead of cloakes they
carried hatchets, and that it was the fashion of the Country: whereupon it came
to my mind, Cloak, quasi Cleaue-oake, ergo the Boores wear hatchets in steed
of cloakes.

There are other fashion Boores, who wear white linen breeches as close as
Irish trouzes, but so long, that they are turned up at the shoe in a role like
a maids sleeves at the hand, but what these fellows want in the bigness of
their hose, they have in dublets, for their sleeves are as big as breeches and
the bodies great enough to hold a kinderkin of beer and a barrel of butter.

The Countey is very full of woods, and especially oaks, which they very
seldom cut down, because of the mast for their swine, which live there in
great abundance. If any man be slain or murdered on the way, they use to set
up a wooden cross in the place, for a memorial of the bloody fact committed
there, and there were many of those wooden crosses in the way as I traveled.

They seldom have any robbery committed amongst them, but there is a murder
with it, for their unmannerly manner is, to knock out a man's brains first, or
else to lurk behind a tree, and shoot a man with a piece or a pistol, and so
make sure work with the passenger, and then search his pockets.

It is as dangerous to steal or kill an hare in some places there, as it is to
rob a Church or kill a man in England, and yet a two-penny matter will
discharge the offender, for the best and the worst is but an halter; and I was
informed that an English Merchant (not knowing the danger) as he was riding on
the way, having a piece charged in his hand (as it is an ordinary weapon to
travel with there) by chance he espied an hare, and shot at her and killed
her; but he was apprehended for it, and it was like to have cost him his life;
but before he got out of the trouble, he was feign to use his best friends and
means, (and pleading ignorance for his innocence) at last with the loss of a
great deal of liberty, and five hundred pound in money, he was discharged: The
reason of this strict conrse is, because all the hares in the country do
belong to one Lord or other, and being in abundance, they are killed by the
owners appointment, and carried to the markets by cart-loads, and sold for the
use of the honorable owners: and no Boore or Tenant that dwells in those parts
where those hares are plenty, must keep a dog, except he pay five shillings
a year to the Lord, or else one of his fore-feet must be cut of that he may
not hunt hares.

A man is in almost as high promotion to be a knave in England, as a Knight in
Germany, for there a Gentleman is called a Youngcurr, and a Knight is but a
Youngcurs man, so that you shall have a scuruy Squire command a Knight to hold
his stirrup, pluck off his boots, or any other vnknightly piece of service:
and verily I think there are an 100. several Princes, Earls, Bishops and
other estates, that do every one keep a mint, and in their own names stamp
Money, Gold, Silver, and Brass, and amongst 23. two pences which I had of
their brass money (which they call Grushes) I had 13. several coins.

Many more such worthy injunctions and honorable ordinances I observed, which
are hardly worth pen and ink the describing, and therefore I omit them, and
draw toward an end, for on the Wednesday morning I was at an anchor at St^ad,
and on the Friday night following I was (by Gods gracions assistance) landed at
London. So that in three weeks and three days, I sailed from England to
Hamburgh and back again, staying in the country 17. days, and traveled
200. miles by land there: gathering like a busy Be all these honyed
observations, some by sight, some by hearing, some by both, some by neither,
and some by bare supposition.

FINIS.
