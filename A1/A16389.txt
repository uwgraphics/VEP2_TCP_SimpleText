Right as all stringes ar reullit in ane harp

And other true put in the stead als tyte
And change ay sua quhill he find true concord
Than will men say he is worht to be lord
Thou ryall king all yis should reull yi realm
Good sound and suthe fast to yi seges gif
Thy time to teache all should be taken as tewme
Thy lawis should ger yi lyeges laulik lif
Thou should ger syft yi segis throu a siff
Se quhawer worht to worschip quha to wa
And yam reward eftir as yai cause ma
Reward worthy and punise wekitnes
Nurice virtue exclude vice and error
Consider weill ye sound of yi seges
Know there curage as face in a mirror
Sen god maid ye to be there gouuernour.
And you put blind men in there gouuernans
Thou salbe punist for there ignorans
For sic men as you deputes under ye
Quheder yai be fulis wekit men or wise
All men will traist ye sic like moan you be
As you co^mittes to gouern^ thy office
Hou should a man but knawlege keip justice
Or but wisdome^ to be a gouernoure
Thus may you neuyr of there deidis haif honor.
Bot ger young lordis study in yi laws
And in there youth head tak sum techement
How should a man be wise that no thing knawis
To gif ye counsale in yi parliament
Or for to gif a rygth wise judgment
Nor for to govern justice in yi land
That hes there wit to seik at othiris haned
O prince think quhy yi croune was gewin ye till

Fra hieast god to discern good and ill
Expel wikkit and luf yam that are wise
And our all things put wisemen in office
And know yam well that sall yi iugis be
Sen all ye pligtht and perell lyis on^ ye
Bot sen a mannis wit may not suffice
For to mantene so hie a governance
Thou should ger choice yi covnsale that were wise
Be all yi three estatis hayl ordinance
Syne lay alhale ye charge in there balance
To gif ye counsale in yi governance
As yai will ansuer and to ye great judgment
And cheise na man for hye lordschip na blud
Na great power of riches to counsale

Quhilk god and man plesis there gouuernail
That hes ye voces of all ye co^mounis haill

And knawe^ of good lif and good conscience
Think one yat you moan gif a tribute compte.

For to comper quhare you sall langest duel
Quhar na reward sall be bot heuin or hell

Quhat makes yis bot caytif creaturis
Quhilk couth newir counsale bot in ^ovatise
Quhilk had newir heart nor heid till he honoris
Wenand no wy bot wrethitnes I wise
Lord god quhar ar yer princis he of price
Quhilk one justice set all their erdly glore
And richit yam self et there realm more et more
Thar should newir caytife be counsale till a king
Ne king should newir of his small comptis know
Na wit of scantnes na of wrethit thing
Quhilk myt his heart to neid or mister draw.
All his delight sald be to keip ye law
For hie honor hie worschip et renoune
With wrethitnes restis newir in a person
It is degrading till a king is crovne
To mell with small wrechit besynes
Na with na tutlaris for to rouk na rovne
To lere to conquese gudis with scantnes
Nobilite should mell bot with nobilnes
And specialie ye noble majesty
Should newir be travalit bot in matters hie
For sic men counsalis ewir to covatise
The quhilk to law is mortale innemy
Great covatise is marchand of justice
Et ewir is ready law to sell et by.
Should men sic be of yi counsales for yi
Na bear office quhar in yi honor lyis
Quhilk myt be botht fra justice on^ yis wise
And exclud al effectione singlare
And to ye commone profet ay tak heyd
Quhen kingis settis yam for prow particulare
The realm sall newir haif honor of there deid
Dreidis you to want or quhare of hes you dreid.
Luf weill yi god him serve et keip justice
Riches rebondes to men yat ar ryttuise
Quha wald be rich haif ee to honor ay
For riches follouis honor euyr mayr
Till honor wisdom is ye nerrest way
And wisdom to wertu is ye verray aere
And virtue cu^is ever of sciens and of laire
And sciens cu^is only throu gods grace
Conquest throu good lif trauale and besynes
Thus sen^ virtue is ground of alkin grace
And souerane lord of virtue is justice
As well of worschip and of worthynes
For nane ar saif bot men that are rihtuise
Hald virtue in yi heart and you be wise
And in justice set all yi besy cure
Thy realm sall rich and you sall neuyr be pure
Quhen rome was regit be wise senatoures
In justice and in publik polise
Our all yis erd yai were lord and wictouris.
And tuk tribute for souuera^ seneyori
Bot quhen ye well of justice was gane dry
And public prow past in diui^ioune
Thar great glore turnit in dissolatiouns
Her for keip law gif you wald hald yi land
And luf largese or you sall lordschip leise
But quhill: great stait myghth t^lang steadfast stand
The example in the be for yi self you seis
For falt of law all fawour of fortoune^ fleis
Herfor sectouris fermly scha haldis at fed
For quhilk her dynt is dishonor and deide
Justice wald haif a general president
Ane auditour of complante of ye pure
The quhilk daily should m^ster judgment
To pure at cry justice at yi dur
Spendand mar ya^ there clame is of valor
Syne put on bak quhill great cause decyde.
Syne lewand all for pouerte may not bide.
It is imposible to yi great counsale
For to discuss all materis small and great
Bot to small men commit all causis small
Of pur plen^yeand that rarys at yi yet
Quhilk daily hes not half there till of met
With wif and barnis suonand for falt of bred
For quhilk god sall ye challange of there deed.
Thy Iuges als yet hes justice to leide

Stopand ye laif for luf frendschip or feide
For radour request for meid or wairsone^
Syne quhen ye parti comple^yeis to ye croune

Quhilk for there complaynt full dear sall by ye blame.
The maneris ar of iugis general
First to yi god sine to yi awin person
To god you hald yi heart et conscience haill
As to yi self and not to exceid resone
Syne to do law to peple^ in to conmoune^
For first you should ya^ schaw a good m^^rour.
For people often followis ye tred of ye pastor
Quhat thank cu^nis god ye for to iustefy

And syne yi self to leif may wranguisly
Doand na resion to na creatur

Good justice has ii parties principale
the taken is dome et ryttuise judgment
The toyir is to make ye scathis haill
Eftir ye dome ye partiis to content
And there of make yaim sikir incontinent
Eftir ye terme^ of law aluterly
Or ellis ye judge is detour werraly
Quhat walis ama^ yi rightuis judgment

And syne ye partis newir to be content

Trowis you not god and hieast hevin them heris
Cryand wengeance for falt of liffis fude
Of ye et them yat revis yam there good
Sanct david sais in haly prophecy
The man is blissit yt dois bayth dome et law
Quhilk quhen he giffis a sentens suchfastly
Gerris executit for any mannis aw
Not anerly to seill a nakit saw
For to god it is bot vter dirisioun^
A bair sentens but executioun^
And be it a sentens of a souueraine lord
Quhilk signifiis sentens superlatife
Quhen dome is gevin et na remeid set ford
And term of al law allegit to prestrife
Fra that tym furthe there is no man on^ lif
May it revoke but hurting to ye croune^
And degrading to ye iurisdictioun^
yhit is a thing yat mekle^ grevis yi croune
Quhilk seildin is remedit in yi land
Quhen any man make rebellione,
For wrang or det not bowand to yi wand
Deforsand maser sireff or seriand

Quhar nane aw is how should there follow grace

Quhen yi great counsale with yi awin consent
Hes ordanit strait justice na man to spair
Within schort time you changis yin intent
Sendand a contrar letter incontinent
Chargeand that of that matter mar be nogth
Than all ye world murmuris at thou art bogth
