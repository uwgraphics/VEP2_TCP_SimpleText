A most excellent Ditty, called Collins Conceit.
To the tune of Wigmores Galiard.
COnceits of sundry sorts there are,
but this Conceit of mine,
Does wish all men to have a care,
to live by wisdoms line.
In my conceit if men would look,
where sacred virtues dwell.
And live according to Gods Book,
then all things should be well.
If wisdom were once made our guide,
she would direct us right,
Where now we daily slip aside,
for want of wisdoms light.
If we had faith, we need not fear
the Devil nor powers of Hell:
If godly faith our Anchor were,
then all things should be well.
If we could learn to love the Lord,
with an unfeigned love,
And willingly obey his Word,
as duty does us move:
If we would leave our wickedness,
wherein we do excel,
And give our minds to godliness,
then all things should be well.
If people did not go to Church,
only for fashion sake:
If one would not another lurch,
nor yet had courses take:
If all those that seem so pure,
would not by false weights sell,
But justly deal, we might be sure
that all things should be well.
If men would not, to purchase gain,
falsely themselves forswear.
Nor take the name of God in vain,
but live in dread and fear:
If all hypocrisy were left,
which daily does excel:
If me were not of zeal bereft,
then all things should be well.
If conscience were not ouerstrai'nd,
for to oppress the weak:
If subtle mates were not maintai'nd,
if none would promise break:
If spiteful men did not delight,
in wrangling uites to dwell:
If one kept not another wife,
then all things should be well.
If no man would false witness bear
for lucre or for love:
If no contentious people were
disquiet for to move:
If none would hurt the innocent,
nor (...) money sell
Another life, twere time well spent,
then all things should be well.
If bloody murdering would cease,
which does for vengeance cry:
If every man would seek for peace
and live contentedly:
If drunkenness and gluttony,
that does so much excel:
If none would practice cruelty,
then all things should be well.
If Parents would instruction use,
and youth in time correct:
Would youth good counsel note rfuse
but thereto have respect:
If servants were obedient
to those with whom they dwell
If they were quick and diligent,
then all things should be well.
If fornication were not used,
nor foul adultery:
In every place were bribes refused,
and partiality:
If no man would his neighbor wrong
which far or near him dwell,
Nor stain their credits with his tou^g,
then all things should be well.
If scolding queanes were punished,
did witches hang or burn:
If bawds and whores not suffered,
some had a blessed turn:
If we did not delight to sit
in sins dark shadow Cell:
If godly wisdom gouernd wit,
then all things should be well.
If crafty heads would once g^ scant,
which scrape and claw for gain,
The poor and needy souls that want
would not so much complain.
If trust might lie safe in his bed,
If truth might buy and sell,
If double dealing once were dead,
then all things should be well.
If cunning Cutpurses and thieves,
were clean out of the way,
Then some false knaves that true men grieve
should not remain this day.
If swearing were once out of ure,
that none of oaths could tell:
If lies were lost, we might be sure,
that all things would be well.
If carry-tales, that breed debate,
were hid from Man and Wife:
Then surely each man with his mate,
might lead a quiet life:
If neighbors would like friends agree
and love among us dwell:
If pride might once expelled be,
then all things should be well.
If Landlords would leave racking rent,
if Usury would cease:
If we had not great malcontent,
this Land might live in peace.
If Justice would not swerue at all,
if malice would not swell:
Might high aspiring climbers fall,
then all things should be well.
If rash and hasty people would
to patience give place:
If wrath were left, a number would
not be so void of grace:
If hatred were abandoned,
were envy driven to hell:
If Idelnesse were punished,
then all things should be well
If deeds of charity were used.
if poor men were not proud,
If Officers were not abused,
if dice were not allowed:
If Lawyers would not suits prolong,
but to their Clients tell
How cases stand, if right or wrong,
then all things should be well.
If flattering pick-thanks were expeld
out of the Commonwealth:
If men a moderate diet hold,
they might live long in health:
If hel-bred covetousness and pride
did not amongst us dwell:
If rich men were not merciless,
then all things should be well.
If poor men's states were pitied.
which do in prison lie:
If sick ^olke were much comforted,
in their necessity:
If ^^edes-men did not use deceit,
If fraud did not excel:
Did wicked men practice no sleight^,
then all things should be well.
If these false traitors were found out,
which would this Realm bet^^^*
Then should all England round about,
stand at a better stay.
That wicked vices may decay,
and virtue bear the bell,
To God let us most humbly pray,
and so we shall do well
FINIS.
