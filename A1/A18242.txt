Ad vniuersos in regno Britannico, tam probitate quam doctrina decoratos
Ludimagistros Tetradecastichon, Interpretis dedicatorium.
ARtis Grammaticae doctores atque Columnae,
O and Calliopes Angligenumque decus:
Vobis ista dico, non mores, more Magistri,
Vt vos erudiam, praecipiamue, bonos.
(Ad mare, tali etenim, latices defer viderer,
Officio, gravidis mella apibusque dare)
Sed modo deuoti monimentum and pignus amoris,
Vt maneant vobis discipulisque, mei:
Quos vero istorum potius protectio tangit,
Quam qui gymnasijs ipsa Latina docent?
Vos igitur gratumque ratumque tenete libellum,
Patroni and proprij protegitote, meum.
Sub quibus (inuidiae quanquam circundatus armis)
Mercurij tanquam virga animatus, eat.
Ad studiosos Discipulos Hexasticon.
SJ dictata probis praeceptis vestra, vel aptis
Themmata dogmatibus non decorare piget:
Si cordi est vobis, comptos perdiscere mores,
Et been viuendi noscere rite viam:
Vt Cato praecepit Romany, carmina, verbis,
Judice, maternis quaerite nostra, duce.
To all industrious Masters of the Pen.
Lo, you whose exquisite and honored skill,
(A liberal Science worthy to be stilde)
Keeps in renoun'd esteem the fether'd Quill:
By whom great matters from confusion wild
Are brought to order, whose recording aid,
Supports the chiefest Calling, Art, or Trade:
Lo, a sententious Treasure I prefer,
For needful use to your most active hands.
A treasure, if true Wisdom do not err;
Worth more then manual knowledge, goods or lands:
This then for Copies to your Scholars give,
So may they learn at once to write, and live.
To all careful and vertuously-disposed Parents and Householders.
IF having Children, you would well instruct the^,
And unto God through virtuous way conduct the^;
If you with prudent precepts do not scorn
Your Hearts to fill, and Houses to adorn:
Or if vnskil'd you covet to discern,
What good your Sons from Latin Cato learn:
This Book in price, and in proportion small,
Yet great in Matter, satisfies you all.
The Translators Preface to the Beneuolent Perusers.
THe Doctrine of Wisdom (like running water) ought to be common, because, by
how much any one instructs others, by so much he multiplieth and acquireth
wisdom to himself, according to that, Qui alios docet, seipsum instruit, He
that teaches others, learneth himself. For knowledge is described to be an
incomparable Treasure, and a noble possession of the mind, which being
distributed by parts, takes increase, and disdaining a covetous possessor,
without distribution quickly decays.

I therefore considering that the Moral Distichs entitled Cato, being in the
Latin tongue, were learned and read only in Schools by Children, and desiring
to spend my vacant hours in some commendable study for the benefit of my
Country, (to which end especially we are born) conceived it a work of worth to
translate the same in our mother tongue, both for the Instruction of such
Parents, and others, as were ignorant of the Latin, and for a general use for
which they were intended, as hereafter in this Preface I shall declare.

But first let me search into, and express the fourfold cause of this work,
that concurreth to the ordering of every thing, to wit, the Material, Final,
Efficient, and Formal cause.

The Material cause or matter of this Book (which is the same) are the four
Cardinal virtues, Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance, which are
called Cardinal, by a Metaphor or Figure, of Cardo a hinge, because as a door
is turned on the hinges, so all other virtues are reduced to these four, as
forms to their kinds. The first introduces or brings in, because a man
through Wisdom is brought unto Sciences and Virtues. The Second directs,
because a man is directed by Justice to the kingdom of Heaven. The Third
ouercomes for a man is said through Fortitude to overcome his spiritual
enemies, the world, the Flesh, and the Devil. The Fourth tempereth, for it
teaches us to live soberly in this world, and to abstain from carnal
desires. All which virtues, with their several Daughters or Branches are
copiously handled in this Book.

The Final cause is profit; both private, as to the Authors own son; and
common, as to us; for by perusing this book like prudent Husbandmen, we may
extirpe or root out vices, and sow the seeds of virtues in our hearts,
whereby with Gods assistance we may avoid the calamities of this present life,
and that to come.

The efficient cause is the Author of this Book, which is unknown, or very
doubtful, so as it may be called Apocryphus, a word signifying greatly
obscure: For the famous Philosopher, and Historiographer, Plutarch, setting
fotth (amongst others) the lives of two virtuous and learned men, bearing the
name of Cato, the one Marcus Portius Cato, called also Censo^^aus of being
Censor; the other likewise, M. P. Cato called also Vticensis, of Vtica, where
he slew himself, whom he further distinguishes with the Additions of mayor
the elder, and minor the younger, shows that Cato mayor died before, and Cato
minor in the time of Julius Caesar, and that (notwithstanding the saying of
Iuuenal, Tertius e coelo cecidit Cato) Cato mayor had two Sons, whereof the
one had also a Son, and that Son the like. And the other had two Sons,
whereof the one was Father of Cato minor. And that Cato minor had a Son, the
whole Progeny bearing the name of Cato, who were all extinct before the time
of Augustus the second Emperor of Rome.

But I observe in the Preface to the second Book of these Distichs, that the
Author advises the Reader, if he desire to know the Roman and civil wars,
(which were those between Julius Caesar and Pompey) he should search Lucan;
whereby it is evident that this book was not before Lucan, who writ his work
after the time of Julius Caesar, and consequently none of the Catones could
possibly be the Author thereof. And therefore some father it on Seneca, who was
Tutor to Nero the fifth Roman Emperor; others on golden-mouthed Chrysostom: And
it was attributed to the Poet Ausonius, by Baptista Pius, (whose opinion some
have lately followed) whom Joseph Scaliger in his Ausonian Lectures sharply
reprooueth, and plainly confuteth. Whereupon may be said, Indiscussa manet,
and adhuc sub Judice lis est.
The strife no Judge did yet decide,
But vndiscust it does abide.


Yet some say it is thus entitled, Incipit Ethica Catonis, The Moral Science
of Cato begins; not because Cato composed it, but to the end it might be of
the more authority. Others say the Title is thus, Incipit Tullius de
praeceptis Catonis; and that he composed this work when he first entered
Rhetoric, but called the same by the name of Cato (as his Treatise,
entitled, Cato mayor de Senectute) that it might be the more willingly
received: which Tully also (as Plutarch recites in the life of Caesar) writ
the praise of Cato minor, and inscribed it Cato; and now it is entitled,
Libellus elegantissimus qui inscribitur Cato, that is, a most elegant book
inscribed Cato. And the same Scaliger in the aforementioned place, says, that
these Distichs were inscribed with the name of Cato, because the goodness of
Cato was known to all men by way of Proverb; for good men, and of most
approved manners, in those days were called Catones. And such is the censure
of the learned Erasmus, expressed in an Epistle prefixed to an ancient Latin
Edition of these Distichs (wherewith the Greek of Planudes is intermixed)
Catonis (says he) ob id tantum arbitror dici, quod Sententias habeat Catone
dignas. I suppose it to be called Cato, because it has Sentences worthy of
Cato.

And this name of Cato was first given to Cato mayor, (as Plutarch affirms)
for his skilfulnesse in affairs. For (to Etymologize the word) it may be
derived of Catus a Cat, because he was crafty as that creature, or rather of
Catus, an old syncopation of Cautus, interpreted, wary, subtle and skillful.
Yet Tranquillus makes mention of one Valerius Cato, a Grammarian at Rome, who
taught many, and of noble stock, in the time of Scylla, whose fame these
verses record to us; Cato Grammaticus Latina Siren
Qui solus legit, and facit Poetas.
Which may I thus translate.

Grammar-learn'd Cato that the Poets reads,
Even Syren-like alone and Poets breeds.
Whereby it may be coniectured, and it is probable enough, that Valerius Cato,
if any of the name, writ this book, especially for his Scholars instruction,
and education in virtue, and generally for the benefit of the Commonwealth, as
Socrates, Isocrates, and others instructed their Country in moral virtues, by
way of Precept. To conclude, for my part, seeing the name or person is not so
much to be traced out or regarded as his good doctrine, I will not certainly
ascribe the penning of these Precepts to any one particular man, or more, more
then Erasmus Maturinus Corderius, or any others have done in their precedent
Comments, or Translations, but leave the deciding thereof, as a
Schoole-question, to the deeper Schollership of others.

Now the Formal cause is, the manner of composing this Work, which is
twofold, to wit, in Prose, as the Preface; in Verse, as the Execution or
Treatise; for he uses an Hexameter style, distinguishing his work into four
parts. We must note therefore that the Author premiseth a Preface to his
work, or the first book thereof. In the first part of which Preface,
considering that men beyond measure gaped after worldly desires, and were
remote from the way of Truth, he promises to give them aid. In the Second he
speaks to his Son, and all others in the person of him, insinuating unto
them an order of wel-liuing. In the Third, he treats of Divine worship. In
the Fourth, of piety toward our Parents, and Kindred. And in the Fifth and
last, he handles virtues and Sciences, and warnes us to beware of vices.
Which Preface being ended, he sets upon the Treatise, where he executes in
Meeter, what he premised in Prose, for profit, delight and ornament, and that
it may be more firmly committed to memory, every Distich, or two Verses, (for
so the word signifies) containing a Precept, and (for the most part) a
Sentence, teaching us our duty toward God and man; as also how to demean our
selves in all estates and conuersations. So that whosoever was the Author, it
worthily deserves, not only of all sorts to be gratefully received,
diligently perused, dearly esteemed, and faithfully observed; but to be
translated into the vulgar tongue of all Nations.

Nevertheless, let me by the way admonish and forewarne you (which Erasmus
has omitted) to beware of some few of these Precepts, which I have noted with
an Asteriske thus * being in part Heathenish, and contrary to Christian
doctrine or not fully therewith cohering, as their several Annotations in the
last leaf of this Book, under the Title of Necessary Notes, etc. do make
manifest.

But all the rest being just, and appertinent to our faith and good carriage
(though they may not be compared to that Book of Books, the sacred
Scripture) we are not only to credit and follow (as Saint Augustine teaches
in his Book De Doctrina Christiana) but to challenge and retain them even as
our own, the rather for that the Author is not known, and if he were, being
a Heathen, he is indeed no right owner thereof. For God made manifest his
wonderful power and wisdom in the hearts of the Heathen or Gentiles, chefly
for the better instruction and confirmation of the faith of Christians to come,
Graces and Gifts being not now so plenteously bestowed by him, as in ages past.

Lastly, for my study and labor in this present work, not only by mine own
consideration and desire, as aforesaid, but by the advice of diverse worthy
friends, I was thereunto animated* and am now cherished with an assured
confidence, that you will not reject nor neglect it, for the unlearned style or
rudeness of my Pen, but rather lovingly accept it, in respect of the excellent
Counsels and Sentences it contains, and for my good will and great pains
therein expended, as may appear, not only in the translation of the Verse,
but in the addition of a Threefold Table at the end, by me diligently and
elaborately ordered and contrived, both for pleasure and profit, and for the
better use of the original, whereby may be readily found any Document or
Saying therein contained, either for Grammar-Schollers to insert and apply in
their Theames and other exercises, or for Children to be taught and learned
both within and without Book at the Reading-schoole, or for their Copies at
the Writing-schoole, or for Men and Women unlearned not only to read,
understand, and learn, for the furnishing of their hearts and behauiours, but
to adorn their Houses with good and godly Poesies, as well for daily objects to
their own optike senses, lest being out of sight, they should be also (to
uphold the Proverb) out of mind, as also for the instruction of all Comers,
or friendly visitants, that have not been so happy as to read the whole work,
which represents both the beauties and blemishes of the mind, and manners;
as a Crystal mirror or looking glass the conditions of each Countenance,
for which cause I may justly entitle it, The mirror of the mind, and so leave
it in your hands as A handful of honesty; not vegetative, like the weed so
called, but rational, Philosophical, and for the most part, Theological;
wishing your eyes may never part from it, nor the clapper of your lips take
intermission before your hearts, and such, whose ears attend you, be edified
by the discipline ensuing. And so, lest unto me ye allude the saying of the
Philosopher, when he cried, Hoe, Citizens, shut your gates, that the City
run not out, I here conclude mine, and give place to the Authors Preface.

CATO his Preface to his first Book of Distichs.
Perceiving how greatly men did err and go astray from the Way of
well-liuing, I thought good to impart some aid and advice to their weak
understanding, chiefly, to the end thar they might live in commendable wise,
and attain to honor; Here now (my most dear Son) I will teach thee by what
means thou may order the manners of thy mind. Read therefore these my
Precepts, in such sort, that thou may perfectly understand them: For, to read
any thing, and not understand it, is to neglect what thou read.

The end of the Preface.
CATO his Distichs.

Him serve thou chiefly with unspotted sprite.

7 Company-keepers. Politicians.
As time requires, be constant, or be light:
The wise, with time his manners changes quite.

9 Friends.
When thou warn'st any, though he will take no heed,
Holding him dear, in warning still proceed.
10 Company-keepers.
Men full of words, with words do not pursue:
All speak, but well to speak, is given to few.
11 Friends, Prodigals.
Love others well, but best thy self befriend,
So help the good, that want thee not attend.
12 Babblers, Talkers, Blabbers, Newes-carriers.
News do not spread, lest thou the head be thought:
Hurt, not by silence, but by speech is wrought.
13 Debtors, Promisers.
Promise not sure, on others if thou trust:
For many men speak much, but few be just.
14 Company-keepers. Praised men.
When praised thou art, thine own Judge look thou be;
Others believe, even as thy self, of thee.
15 Giuers, Receivers.
A benefit received, make known to many,
But when thou give, blab it not to any.
16 Rehearsers of others lives. Old men.
Telling (youth spent) the acts of many a man,
Think on thine own, before old age began.
17 Company-keepers, Suspicious men.
Care not, if any whispering talk arises:
All said of him, the guilty man surmiseth.

21 Poore-men.
Since God at first thee naked did create,

Fowlers pipe sweetly, they the Birds beguile.
28 Parents. Poor men.

29 Householders. Niggards.
Dear what is cheap, cheap what is dear esteem,

30 Carpers.

When faults reprove the Teacher, it is a shame.
31 Suitors.
Ask what is just, or what seem honest may:
For fools require what rightly should have, Nay.
32 Inconstant men. Wavering men.
Do not unknown above things known advance:

In doubtful dangers since our life remains:
Hold thou, that labour'st, each day for thy gains.
34 Contenders. Quarrellers.
Thy Mate, who^ thou may co^quer, sometime spare,
Because good friends are kept with heedfull care.
35 Suitors.
Craving things great, small, fear not to bestow:
For Thankfulness dear friends unites so.

Quarrel not with thy friend, nor anger move:
Ire breeds hatred, Concord feeds love.
37 Masters.
When servants faults provoke thee to displeasure,
Temper thy self to punish them with measure.
31 Conquerors. Strong men. Superiors.
Whom thy force can, sometimes by suffrance quell:

Keep well thy labors fruits: wants greater grow,
When to repair our loss pains we bestow.
40 Prodigals. Householders. Rich men.
When being rich thou make thy friends good cheer,
Be always to thy self a friend most near.
The Second Book.
The Preface.
If thou would learn the tilling of the ground,
Read Virgils Georgicks, where that skill is found.
But if Herbs virtues thou car'st more to know,
Macer the Poet those in Verse will show.
The Roman civil wars to understand
If thou desire, take Lucan in thy hand.
Or if thou would perform the Lovers part,
Repair to Ovid that does teach the Art.
But to live wisely if thy mind be set,
To me give ear, this discipline to get:
By what things man does live from vice remote,
Come, and what Wisdom is, by Reading note.
1 Uncharitable men.
HElp, if thou can, even strangers, for to gain
Friends by deserts, is better then to reign.
2 Astronomers, or searchers of secrets.
Gods secrets* or what Heaven is, leave t'enquire:
Since thou art mortal, mortal things desire.
3 Fearers of Death.
The fear of Death, which is mere folly, fly:
Life's joys thou losest, if thou fear to die.
4 Angrymen. Disputers.
Strive not, for ought unsure, with angry mind;
Toward the truth wrath makes ouriudgme^t blind
5 Friends.
Spend quickly, when the cause it self desires,
And somewhat give when time or cause requires.
6 Ambitious men, Prodigal men.
Make merry with a little, shun excess:
More safe the Ship is, where the waves be less.
7 Blabbers, offenders.
Keep wisely from thy Mates, what may thee shame;
Lest, what offends thee only, more do blame.
8 Offenders.
Their evil works think not the wicked gain:
Sins for a time kept hid, time does explain.
9 Little, or weak men. Soldiers.
Do not a little bodies power despise:
Whom Nature has made weak, he may be wise.
10 Clients. Vanquished men. Inferiors. Soldiers.
Give place a while unto thy stronger foes:
The Vanquished often his Victors overthrows.
11 Company-keepers. Friends Quarrellers.
Braule not with him, who^ thou do loving know:
From the least words, great strife does often grow.
12 Fortune Tellers. Searchers of secrets. Sorcerers.
What God intends, search not in sorcerous wise,
Who touching thee, without thee does advise.
13 Proud men.
Envy, through too much bravery come not near:
Which, though not hurtful, it is a grief to bear.
14 Clients. Oppressed men.
Be of good comfort though condemned wrong:
Naught by Injustice gotten prospers long.
15 Remembrers of strife.
Of brabbling conflicts to use repetition
After atonement, shows a bad condition.
16 Company-keepers. Selfe-praisers, and dispraisers.
From self-praise and dispraise thou must abstain:
For Fools do that, prouok'd by Glory vain.
17 Gamesters. Prodigals.
Thy gains use sparing: for excessive spending,
Goods long in gathering brings to speedy ending.
18 Company-keepers.
When time or cause requires it, play the Fool,
For folly then to feign, is wisdoms rule.
19 Covetous men.
Shun Luxury and Avarice, for those
(As each the other) thy good name oppose.
20 Babblers. Talkers.
Believe not them, that still are babbling much,
For little credit is allowed to such.
21 Drunkards.
In drinke-offending do not that accuse,
The fault's in thee that do Gods gift abuse.
22 Friends* Sick men.
Commit thy mind to a Companion sure,
To a Physician good thy bodies cure.
^3 Poor men. Repiners at others good.
At vndeseruers weal grieve not at all:
The bad be cocker'd for their greater fall.
24 Careless men.
Arm thee to bear each casual distress,
For what thou have foreseen does hurt thee less.
25 Poor men.
Be not dismayed, though crossed, but hope retain;
For with all men, Hope does in death remain.
26 Careless men.
Let not that slip, which thou shall fitting find:
Time has much hair before, but none behind.
27 Careless men.
Weighing things past, for what is to come provide
Follow that God which looks on either side.
28 Drunkards. Gluttons.
Fare sometimes, to grow stronger, with less measure:
Many to health, few things are due to pleasure.
29 Company-keepers. Selfe-conceited men.
The peoples judgment scorn not thou alone,
Lest, while thou scornest many, thou please none.
30 Drunkards. Gluttons.
Chiefly regard thy health which is the chief,
Blame not the times, that wrought'st thy proper grief.
31 Dreamers.
* See the note at the end of the book under C.
Regard not dreams, for what we wish awake,
That thing in sleeping does our senses take.
The third Book.
The Preface.
Thou (Reader) that hereto thy mind do give,
Shall here learn precepts teaching well to live:
Be stored with Lessons, learn while thou have breath,
Life without Learning does resemble death:
Much good thou reapest, if thou this respect,
Jf not, thy self, not me, thou do neglect.
1 Well-liuers.
Living upright, the slanderers words despise:
All tongues to rule, in us no power lies.
2 Witnesses, Friends.
Brought for a witness, thy friends fault conceal,
In what thou can, yet with thy honors weal.
3 Simple men.
Of smooth and flattering speeches take thou heed:
For Truth is plain, but lies do cunning need.
4 Sluggards.
Fly dullness (sloth of life) for when the mind
Grows weak through idleness, the flesh is pinde.
5 Laboring men.
Mirth sometimes mingle with thy care and pain,
That any labor thou may well sustain.
6 Carpers.
Carpe never at another word or deed,
Lest the like measure do from him proceed.
7 Heirs. Prodigals.
Lest all speak ill of thee, keep and increase
Those goods that fall to thee by Friends decease.
8 Covetous men. Old men.
If thou be rich in age, before life ends
Be liberal, and no niggard, to thy Friends.
9 Masters. Scorners.
To no man's Counsel profiting be nice,
Much less despise thy servants good advice.
10 Husbands. Poor men.
If treasure as thou did, thou can not hoord,
Contented live with what the times afford.
11 Bachelors.
* See the note at the end of the Book under D.
For goods beware thou marry not a wife,
Nor keep her, if she lead a shrewish life.
12 Politicians.
By pattern learn to fly or to pursue;
The lives of others teach us what to do.
13 Attempters.
Try naught above thy strength, lest ouer-swaid,
Perforce thou leave thy work, in vain assaid.
14 Concealers.
Conceal not what thou know unjustly done;
Lest thou seem willing the same course to run.
15 Clients. Oppressed men.
Under Laws rigor crave the Judges aid:
For Laws themselves with right would be allaid.
16 Offenders.
Take thy deserved penance without grudge,
And being faulty, be thy proper Judge.
17 Readers. Schoole-boyes.
Read much, and daily more; the Poet sings,
Though not still credible, miraculous things.
18 Babblers. Guests. Talkers.
Use few words at a feast, lest thou be named
A prater, while thou would be civil fam'de.
19 Husbands.
Thy angry wife's bad language do not fear,
For women work deceit with every tear.
20 Prodigals.
Thy gettings use, but seem not to abuse;
All gone, the spend*thrift others goods pursues.
21 Fearers of Death.
Stand not in fear of thy threed-cutting Fate,
Seeing life's evils it does terminate.
22 Husbands.
Thy wife's tongue suffer, if she thrifty be,
Else do not bear; yet brawle, is worse in thee.
23 Children.
Entirely love thy Father and thy Mother,
Neither, to please the one, displease the other.
The fourth Book.
The Preface.
If thou would live in quiet, and thy heart,
From vices drowning, virtue keep apart:
These precepts thoroughly read and bear in mind,
Where somewhat to instruct thee thou shall find.
1 Covetous men. Niggards. Rich men.
IF thou would be heart-happy, wealth despise,
Which they that dote upon, live beggar-wise.
2 Covetous men.
If that may please, which does at need avail thee,
Natures commodities will never fail thee.
3 Careless men. Prodigals.
If through ill-husbandry thy substance fall,
Blame not blind Fortune, which is not at all.
4 Covetous men. Rich men.
Love Coin for use, not for it is glittering sight,
In which no virtuous man does take delight.
5 Sick men. Rich men.
Look to thy health enjoying worldly pelf.
The Rich man sick has gold, but not himself.
6 Children. Offenders.
Since thou endur'st thy Masters rod at School,
Thy Father chiding, gently bear his rule.
7 Attempters.
Trade in commodious things, and those eschew
Whereof thou fear no profit will accrue.
8 Giuers.
Give at once asking what you safely can:
For it is a gain, if to a worthy man.
9 Suspicious men.
Search out without delay what thou suspectest,
For often that hurts, which thou at first neglectest.
10 Whoremongers.
When thou art caught in Venus pleasing snare,
Of Gluttony, the bellies friend, beware.
11 Carelesse-men.
Of all wild Beasts when thou would be afraid,
Take heed lest man alone do thee invade.
12 Strong-men.
When as the body does in strength surmount,
Be wise, and men will valiant thee account.
13 Friends. Grieved men.
Repair to him that loves thee, if ought grieve thee:
A faithful Friend can best in mind relieve thee.
14 Offenders, Sacrificers.
For thy offense why make thou beast-oblation*
It Is folly by such means to seek salvation.
15 Chusers of Friends, Bachelors.
When thou desire a true Friend or Mate,
Ask after his life past, not his estate.
16 Covetous men. Niggards.
Shun this name (Niggard) use thy gotten store:
What good does wealth to him that lives poor?
17 Drunkards. Gluttons. Whore-mongers.
If thou desire in life an honored name,
Fly vicious pleasures that would thee defame.
18 Mockers. Young men.
Mock not old age, thou being wise in thought:
For man through age to childishness is brought.
19 Children. Schoole-boyes.
Learn something, for if Riches do deceive thee,
Art will be firmly thine, and never leave thee.
20 Politicians. Babblers.
With silence note what every one does say:
The Speech men's manners hides, and does bewray.
21 Schoole-boyes.
Though thou have gotten Learning, do not cease:
Practice, as Care the Wit, does Art increase.
22 Fearers of Death.
Death fear not much, who holds at little rate
This present life, dreads not his future fate.
23 Children, Schoole-boyes.
Learn of the learned, and th'vnlearned teach:
The doctrine of good things ought far to reach.
24 Drunkards.
Thy health desiring, Nature drink to please:
Pleasure excessive breeds an ill disease.
25 Inconstant men.
What thou have praised in public, and approou'd,
Blame not (I counsel thee) through lightness moved.
26 Poor men. Rich men.
When Fortune smiles on thee, beware her frown:
Yet hope to rise, when she has cast thee down.
27 Schoole-boyes.
Lean not to learn: Knowledge from study springs,
And long Experience rare wisdom brings.
28 Praisers.
Praise meanly; for whom thou do often commend,
Time will declare how much he is thy Friend.
29 Schoole-boyes.
Blush not to learn, for knowledge does commend*
But those that will not learn, shame does attend.
30 Drunkards. Whoremongers.
Strife, often with pleasing Lust and wine is had:
What Is good in them, embrace: and fly the bad.
31 Company-keepers. Politicians.
From sad and still men thy self safely keep:
Perhaps the calmer water lies more deep.
32 Poor men.
When want prouokes thee to feel sorrow*smart,
Weigh how much worse then other men thou art.
33 Attempters.
Try to thy strength, for by the shore to row,
It Is safer, then to sail where Seas do flow.
34 Clyents. Contenders.
* See the note at the end of this Book under E.
Against the just peruersly strive thou never:
Wrongful vexations God does punish ever.
35 Clients. Poor men.
Losing thy goods* do not with grief complain,
But rather joy that thou did wealth attain.
36 Friends. Losers.
Our goods it is grievous by mishaps to leave:
Yet loss by friends we gently must receive.
37 Worldlings.
Trust not to length of life: where e're we run,
Death follows, as our shadows in the Sun.
38 Sacrificers.
* See the note at the end of this book under F.
Let Calves grow for the plough, and Incense burn:
Gods wrath with slaughtered Beasts you cannot
39 Jnferiours, Vanquished men, Oppressed men.
Yield, having harm, to Fortune and the strong: turn.
For he thy cause may right that did the wrong.
40 Offenders.
Reprove thy self when thou have ought offended:
In healing wounds, grief is by grief amended.
41 Friends.
Thy old Friend altered, do not thou detect,
But the prime-pledges of his love respect.
42 Receivers.
More love to purchase, each good turn requite,
Lest a Loose-office thou be termed right.
43 Fearers of danger. Suspicious men.
Lodge not suspect, lest thou still wretched be*
Death with suspicious men does best agree.
44 Masters.
Though Slaves thou cal'st all those that thou have bought,
Of earth, like them, remember thou art wrought.
45 Careless men.
The first occasion must be quickly taken,
Lest thou too late seek what thou have forsaken.
46 Re^oycers at others death.
In bad men's sudden end rejoice thou not:
They happy dye that have no vicious blot.
47 Husbands.
If poor, thou have a wife of blemished fame,
See thou abhor a friends unfriendly name.
48 Schoole-boyes. Students of the Law.
Much having learned, seek as much again;
Nor (as unsitting to be taught) abstain.
The Authors Conclusion.
49 Writers.
That I write Verse in plain Prose, marvel you?
The Senses briefness bred them two by two.
The Translators conclusion.

Peruse my Preface, which does all relate,
And so these Rimes I terminate.

Thus ends the third Table.
Such of the short Precepts as are meet to adorn the Rooms before mentioned,
and the School, selected and orderly composed in Meeter for the same purpose.
viz.
For the Hall, or Dining-roome.
AT Banquet s little speak. Feasts seldom make.
Be cleanly, and thy drink with measure take.
For the Chamber.
To God pray humbly, sleep for Natures due.
Love thy wife truly, and a whore eschew.
^o^ke to thy charge, and well thy children breed:
Live chastely, and to thy affairs take heed.
For the Study or Counting House.
Come not to private talk without requiring,
Save well thy goods, not other men's desiring:
The law thou made, to suffer be not loath,
And have a care to keep thy lawful oath:
Lend upon Credit, but to whom advise,
Nor of belief be light in any wise.
For the Shop, or Office.
Thy Master fear, mock none, to Nature sleep,
What Is to thy charge committed, safely keep:
Be diligent, shun Harlots conversation;
Fly doubtful games, use harmless recreation.
For the School.
Thy Master fear, sleep, Nature to suffice.
Mock none, nor meaner then thy self despise:
Thy Parents favor let thy patience gain,
Lie not, read books, and bear them in thy brain:
To virtuous discipline thy mind apply,
Play with the Top, and games of hazard fly.
Necessary Notes (wherewith I though^ not to trouble the Margents) which are to
be passed over, until some of the Precepts in this Book do thereunto
severally direct you, as I have mentioned in my Preface.
A

Which counsel is good, but not good enough; for we must do good for Gods
sake, not only to good people, and such as be thankful or worthy, or our
friends, but also to the wicked and unthankful, and to our enemies, to the end
that we may be the Children and Imitators of our heavenly Father, who causes
his Sun to shine afwell upon the evil as the good, and gives his rain both
to the just and unjust.

B

But Christian charity commands that we should not render evil for evil, but
contrariwise, good for evil, and that we should love all men truly, and from
our hearts.

C

This is meant by ordinary dreams; not such visions, whereof the Scripture in
diverse places (...)ion; for those, in respect they are of (...) we ought both
to regard and believe.

D

Nay rather you must keep her till death, if you once marry her; though she
prove never so shrewish or troublesome. For by Christ's Law, a man may not leave
his wife for any cause, except adultery.

E

This is well said, but not well enough. For we ought not to strive peruersly
with any man though unjust, nay, if we will hearken to Christ, we must contend
in no wise, neither justly nor unjustly.

F

Yet God is not pacified with Incense, but (according to the custom in the Old
Testament) the Church kept this Institution which must be referred to another
signification. For you may not think, Almighty God commands that
Frankincense should be brought to him from Arabia: but this Frankincense which
God requires us to offer unto him, and from which he takes the savor of
sweetness, to wit, prayers proceeding from a true faith and a pure heart,
wherewith God is properly delighted and appeased.

The last end.
