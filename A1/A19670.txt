VNIVERSIS SINGVLAtim nostrarum Academiarum Theologis Robertus Croleus, sacrae
Theologiae studiosus. S. O. Aeternam.
EQVIDEM VIRVM, christianae Religionis hostem non vulgarem, aggressus (viri
grauissimi) quos mallem huius nostri certaminis Iudices constituere, quam vos:
qui omni diuinarum scripturaru^ cognitione praediti estis maxim? Vos inquam
incliti huius regni lumina, vtriusque nostrae Academiae theologos intigerrimos,
christianaeque pietatis alumnos maxim pios. Vos igitur omnes inuoco testes
fidelissimos, nostraeque litis arbitros aequissimos, and in omni difficultate
nostra, incorruptissimum vestrum Iudicium appello. Vos etenim scitis (vos
inquam, qui sacra volumina, iam diu cum ingenti foenore triuistis) pugnam hanc
nostram esse vtilem, and christianae Reipublicae maxim necessariam. Agitur
enim de praecipuis christianae Religionis dogmatibus: de praesentia scilicet
Christi in Caena, and de iugi christianorum sacrificio. Realem, substantialem,
and corporalem esse contendit ille: ego non nisi veram, spiritualem, and
sacramentalem, probo. Ille scripturarum and antiquorum patrum testimonijs
nititur: eisdem ego telis iugulum eius peto. Missam vocat ille Ecclesiae
christianae sacrificium: ast ego glorificationem, nominis Dei, per
christianorum obedientiam, illud esse assero. Vter rectius de his rebus
sentiat, vter probabilius scribat: Vestrum iam esto Iudicium. Scio esse non
paucos, qui me temerarium, audacem, petulantem, dixerint: quod ego tam
eruditulus homuncio, tantum virum, tamque omnium iudicio eruditissimum, tam
petulanter appetere sim ausus. Multos esse me multo doctiores, prudentiores,
atque long subtiliores, qui per quindecim iam integros annos, hanc prouintiam
suscipere noluerunt: quam ego, nulla doctrina, nulla prudentia, nulla solertia
munitus, temere suscipere non vereor. Quibus sic responsum esse velim. Me, nec
aduersarij huius potentiam timere: neque imbecillitatem meam respicere. Tantum
in nomine Dei Israelis, eius prelium ineo, eiusque hostem, populique eius
conuitiatorem blasphemum, superbumque prouocatorem impeto: non dubitans quin
sit futurum, vt ille aut palmam porrigat, aut truncus iaceat. Quod multi magis
docti, prudentes and solertes, hactenus cum isto congredi noluerunt, mea nihil
refert: non enim metu magis quam contemptu abstinuisse, mihi videri debeant,
qua^quam sint, qui mihi persuadere sunt conati, bonum esse crabronem non
irritare, and rabiosum canem e somno exitare. Esto, sit crabro, sit canis
rabidus, and leo rugiens: ego tricipitem illum Cerberum, diu diuinae
prouidentiae certitudini horribiliter oblatrantem, per biennium iam silere
coegi: and quis est Rhilistaeus iste incircumcisus, vt meo calamo non
prosternat eum Dominus exercituum? Arrogantiae meae ascribant qui velint, quod
ego tam pusillus, hoc tantum facinus aggredior: si abstulerit Dominus
opprobrium populi sui, nihil est quod ego quaeram amplius. Ast vafer est and
veterator callidus, and ad omnem fallaciam maxim instructus. Sit ita, Ego eius
causam ago: qui versutos in versitia sua comprehendere potest and vult.
Intrepide igitur ego, incircumcisum hunc Philistaeum, in nomine Dei Israelis
oppugno. Ipse enim est qui suae Religionis hosts vniuersos, prosternet,
conculcabit, conteret. Vos igitur adeste Iudices aequissimi (estis enim meo
Iudicio dignissimi) faciteque vt vincenti palma porrigatur: and vt Deo optimo
maximo, vniuersa gloria tribuatur. Valete. Et studiosi studiosis fauete. Ex
Aedibus meis in vico australis opificij iuxta Londinum: quarto Iduum
Septembris. Anno salutis nostrae. 1569.

Vester Robertus Croleus.

TO THOMAS WATSON Doctor of Divinity, Robert Crowley, Student of the same:
vvysheth as to himself, the holy Spirit of God to direct him in all Godly
study.
TWO THINGS CHIEFLYE, moved me to take in hand, to answer your two Sermons,
which you preached before Queen Marie, and caused to be set forth in print, in
the year of our Lord. 1554. One is, for that the estimation that you have in
the Popes Church is such: that whatsoever is known to be of your doing, is of
that sort thought to be so learnedly done, that none can be found amongst us,
able to answer any part thereof. I therefore (much inferior to many of my
mind in Religion) have enterprised to encounter with you: having now (by Gods
providence) a time of more leisure thereunto, than at any time since my return
out of Germany I have had. Wyshing that you having the like leisure, might be
licenced to reply to this answer as you are able: that by the travail of us
two now being at leisure, the truth of the matters that you entreat of, might
be made plain to such as would read our wrytings, and seek for knowledge by
our labors.

The other is the subtle handling of the matters that you entreat of: which
may easily disceyue the simple Reader, and astunnish the learned that has not
seen and weighed the places that you allege for your purpose. The subtlety
whereof, I have set open in such sort: that none can be disceyued by you, but
such as be persuaded that it is impossible for you to lie, or for me to write a
truth. I know, we may both err: and therefore, I would wish that the readers
of our writings should set aside all affections, and give credit to neither of
both, further then they shall by our wrytinges he made understand, that it is
the truth that we teach.

As touching your person, you are to me unknown, as I think, I am to you: but
what mind you were of in religion, when you made these Sermons, I can not but
know, by reading and considering of the same, as you also must needs know,
what mind I am of, if you will in like manner read and consider this mine
answer.

According as Jesus Christ has taught, I do love both your soul and body:
and do wish both to be saved, by the blood of that unspotted Lamb, that by
his death and bloudshedding, has paid a sufficient ransom for the sins of
the whole world.

The errors that you have taught, I do utterly abhor, as detestable and
damnable: wyshing you and all other to do the same. Embraceing now at the
last, the known truth: which has been long time hid by ignorance, from the
greatest number that bare the name of Christians, and is now by the knowledge
of the holy word of God, made known, to as many as will know it, and be not
wilful blind.

Such truth as you have taught, I do wyllingly embrace: and do not any thing
at all, mislike with any thing, for the Authors sake. But my misliking is, with
the matter that is not to be lyked. And when I do at any time seem to mislike
with the Author, it is for that his words have no ground in the holy word of
God, which is as the touchstone to try all men's writings by.

Let us both pray for the spirit of Humility, that we may thereby be made
meet to receive and retain the knowledge of the truth: which God will never
give to the proud, and such as think themselves peerless, and therefore
disdain the brotherly admonitions of such as in their sight are to simple, to
be teachers of such as they be.

The Lord Jesus grant that spirit to as many as profess his name: that we
may once be of one mind in the house of the Lord, to his glory, and the
confusion of Satan. Amen.

FINIS.
To the Christian Readers.
Having occasion oftentimes to be in place where such as are not yet persuaded
that the Popes Church can err, have been bold to utter their minds freely,
affirming that the doctrine which the Protestants teach, is erroneous and
false, especially concerning the presence of Christ in the Sacrament of his
body and blood, and the sacrifice of the Mass: I have perceived, that the same
have been chiefly persuaded and stayed by these two Sermons, made by Doctor
Watson in the first year of Queen Mary's reign. I have therefore wyshed, that
some man of like learning, would have published in print, an answer to those
Sermons: that thereby such as have been disceyued by the subtlety thereof,
might by the plain and simple answer, be brought to the knowledge of the
truth, which no doubt the greatest number of them would embrace, if they might
once be brought to see it. Yea, I know some of them do hunger and thirst, to
see what may be said to the contrary of that which they are yet persuaded in,
by that which seems to them unanswerable.

But whiles I thus wyshed with my self, many years are passed by: and I fear
me, many souls have perished, being blinded by the subtilty of these Sermons.
And hitherto, I can not understand that any man has once purposed to answer
them.

Although therefore, I be of many the most unmeet, and of some most despised,
accounted and reported to be none of the learned: yet rather then the proud
Philistine should still blaspheme the God of Israel, and defy his whole
army, no man being so hardy as to buckle with him, I have in the courage and
confidence of despised David, taken in hand to fight the combat with him, and
do not doubt by the help of David's God, either to cause him to yield, or to
lie headless, despised and forsaken even of his own sort and folowers.

Some man will say (peradventure) that it is but a vain brag to make such a
challenge, knowing that the adverse party may not without license encounter with
me: and if he shall obtain license, yet shall not his doings be suffered to
come to light, unless the same shall be lyked by such as favor my cause. For
my part, I wish that it were as free for him to replye to this mine answer
and to publishe the same, as it is for me to answer his Sermons: and I know
that if he be able and wylling to reply, he can neither lack liberty so to
do, nor means to publish it when it is done. This objection therefore is but
vain.

But that you may have some understanding of that which I have done in this
answer (dear Christians) and with better will read it through and weigh it:
I will in few words declare the effect of my doing therein. First, I have
faithfully reported the Sermons, as they are to be seen in his printed Copy:
altering or changing no one syllable or letter, but such only as do
manifestly appear to be faults escaped by the ignorance or negligence of the
Printer. Secondly, I have weighed and considered the Authorities that he has
alleged with their circumstances: setting down the same in writing to be
seen, that you may in the fear of God, weigh the same also, and judge whether
he have applied them aright or not. And thirdly, I have answered, by the like,
or greater Authority, all that he has labored to confirm by Authority:
either of the scriptures or ancient fathers.

The Lord Jesus direct you all in the reading of these Sermons and answer:
that you may understand and embrace the truth of the matters in controversy,
and in life and conversation, glorify him that has with his spirit of
comfort caused me to go through with this answer: notwithstanding the
manifold ways that Satan has sought to cause me to cast it aside. Fare you
well.

Yours in Christ Robert Crowley.

FINIS.
Here begins the first Sermon.
The Title of Watsons Sermons.
Two notable Sermons, made the third and fifth Fridayes in Lent last past,
before the Queens Highness, concerning the Real presence of Christ's body
and blood in the blessed sacrament, and also the Mass, which is the sacrifice
of the new Testament: by Thomas Watson Doctor of Divinity. I Have heard that
in the days of King Henry the eight: there preached one before him, CROWLEY.
whose Sermon the King liked not, because it was not to be liked. And therefore
he willed Sir Thomas More then being Lord Chauncelor: to give the Preacher
thanks, worthy such a Sermon. He therefore being a man of a pleasant wit,
spoke to the Preacher with a loud voice, that the King might hear, and said:
Sir Thomas Mores thanks.
The Kings Majesty thanketh you for your notable Sermon. Which when the King
heard, he called Sir Thomas to him, and said: What mean you my Lord to give
such thanks in our name? If it like you, quoth he, there be some things
notable evil. Whether the Printer meant so of these two Sermons, I know not.
But I trust that the Reader shall perceive, by the setting open of the
subtlety thereof: that they were not notable good.

Obsecro vos fratres, per misericordiam dei: WATSON. Division. 1.
vt exhibeatis corpora vestra hostiam viuam, sanctam, deo placentem. etc. Roma.
12. Because your Printer has not Englished your Latin text: CROWLEY.
I will be so bold as to English it: that the English Reader (whom your
subtlety may soonest hurt) may understand your text, and wey how good a
ground it is, for you to build, that you would build upon it. I beseech you
brethren (says S. Paul) even for the mercy of God, make your bodies a
sacrifice, living, holy, and acceptable unto God. etc. Roma. 12.

WATSON. Division. 2. Philipians. 3.
If S. Paul writing to the Philippians, the third chapter, was not ashamed to
say, to write one thing diverse times to you, is not pain or sloth to me, but
profitable and necessary for you: much less ought I to be ashamed, for that I
propounde to you at this time, that lesson again which before I have twice
entreated, seeing I intend (by Gods grace) to speak nothing, but that I have
learned either of S. Paul himself, or of such as I think was endued with the
same spirit that S. Paul was. And this I do, not for lack of good matter: but
for lack of better matter in my judgment and more necessary to be learned of
us al at this present.

For what is better, worthyer, and more needful to be taught and learned of
all sorts of men, in these evil days and corrupt time: then how to offer up
our selves to God, a living, holy and pleasing sacrifice, to overcome and
repress our naughty will and affections? to mortify our earthlye members and
conversation? And so to banish sin, that it reign not in our mortal bodies?
the largeness of which matter is so great, and does extend it self in so
many parts, causes, and circumstances: that although the whole matter do
pertayne and have respect to one end: yet the entreating of it being long,
must needs be various, and for that reason can not be tedious, to him that
loves to learn to live well, and please almighty God.

CROWLEY.
Satan, transforming himself into the likeness of an Angel of light, is never
the later an enemy still, according to the true Etymology of his name. Watson
counterfeteth S. Paul.
Even so you (M. Watson) can not by counterfeiting S. Paul, cause us to
believe, that you bear like good will to us, as he did to the Philippians. It
is very true, that no matter can be more profitable to be entreated off in
these evil days: than that which does teach us to offer up our selves to God,
a living, holy and acceptable sacrifice to him. But if you entreated it no
better, in your other two Sermons that you speak off, than you do in these:
you might have been much better occupied in entreating of other matter,
although the same had not been so various as this, and therefore more tedious
to the hearers.

The end of this my matter is, WATSON. Division. 3.
to destroy the kingdom of sin, for which purpose, Gods son was
incarnate, to bring which thing to pass, in us was all the life, the example,
the passion, the Resurrection of Christ, and all the doctrine and sacraments
of Christ. Like as contrary, to erect and establish this kingdom of sin is
all the travail and temptation of the devil, now fawning like a serpent,
transforming himself into an angel of light, to entrappe and seduce the
simple and unware, now raging like a Lion, to overthrow the feeble and
fearful. And not only is it his travail: but also it is the whole labor and
practice, of all his children by imitation. As Infidels, Jews, Heretics,
Scismatikes, false brethren, and counterfeit christians, both in living and
learning, laboring night and day with all wit and will: to destroy the
faith of Christ, the sacraments of Christ, and the sacrifice of Christ, as much
as in them lies. Which three be special means to destroy the kingdom of
sin, which they with all their power set up and maintain.

It is very true (as you say) that the end of our mortification, CROWLEY.
the incarnation, life, suffering, resurrection, doctrine and sacraments of
Christ: is to destroy the kingdom of sin. Watsons words true in himself,
and such other.
And on the contrary, it is all true that you have written: understanding your
self and other of your sort, to be the Heretics, Scismatikes, false brethren
and counterfeit Christians that you speak off.

The practice of the devil and his Ministers in this point, WATSON. Division.

I have partlye touched, and by Gods grace and your patience, shall now proceed
further. I have opened the decay of faith, good works and penance, which be
remedies against sin. One other remedy there is, that lies in much decay,
which will lie still, except good men (according to their bounden duties) put
to their helping hands. I mean the sacrifice of the church, the sacrifice of
the new testament, the sacrifice of our reconciliation, in the body and
blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he has instituted in his last supper,
and so as Ireneus says, Noui testamenti, nouam docuit oblationem: Ireneus. li.
4. cap. 32.
quam Ecclesia ab Apostolis accipiens, in vniuerso mundo offert deo: Christ
confessing, the cup to be his blood, has taught the new sacrifice of the new
testament: which sacrifice, the Church receiving of the Apostles, does offer to
God throughout the whole world.

CROWLEY.
You say you have opened the decay of faith, good works and penance. I have
neither heard nor seen in writing, what you have said of these decays. But
me think I may guess that you do account it a decay of faith, when men can
not believe, that whatsoever the Pope and his Clearkes shall teach, is true: of
good works, when men wax werie of giving their lands and goods to the
maintenance of Idolatry, Master Watsons decay of faith, good works, and
penance.
and false worshipping of God: and of penance, when men can not be persuaded,
that their own works can be any part of satisfaction for their own sins. If
this be your opening of these decays: then have you done as well therein, as
you do here in the decay of the fourth remedy, which you call the sacrifice
of the Church. etc. For neither may the supper of the Lord be properlye
called the sacrifice of the Church, the sacrifice of the new Testament, nor the
sacrifice of our reconciliation: more than to believe all that the Pope shall
teach, may be called the faith in Christ, or to give lands or goods to the
maintenance of Idolatry, may be called a good work, or the seeking to
satisfy for sins, by our own works, may be called penance.

And as for your words cited out of Ireneus, they are not so many as they
should be, and therefore I will cite them as Ireneus wrote them, although it be
something long, that the simple Reader be no longer deceived by your subtle
handling of the Fathers writings.

And first I must tell you that your Printer has quoted your book wrong. For
it is in the.32. Watsons book wrong quoted.
Chapter of Ireneus his fourth book, and not in the.35. as your printed copy
has it.

Thus says Ireneus lib. 4. cap. 32. Hij sunt, inquit, Zacha. cap 8.
sermones quos facietis. Loquimini veritate^ vnusquisque ad proximum suum, and
iudicium pacificum iudicate in portis vestros, and vnusquisque malitiam fratris

haec omnia odi, dicit Dominus omnipotens. Et David autem similiter. Quis est,
Psalm. 34.
inquit, homo, qui vult vitam, and amat dies videre bonos. Cohibe linguam tuam
a malo, and labia tua ne loquantur dolum. Declina a malo and fac bonum, inquire

and holocaustomata quaerebat ab eis Deus: sed fidem, and obedientiam, and
iusticiam, propter illorum salutem. Oseae. 6.
Sicut in Osea Prophetae, docens eos Deus suam voluntatem, dicebat.
Misericordiam volo quam sacrificium, and agnitionem Dei super holocaustomata.
Math. 9.
Sed and Dominus noster eadem monebat eos, dicens. Si enim cognouissetis, quid

primitias suorum munerum in nouo testamento, de quo in.12. Prophetis Malachias
sic praesignificauit. Malach. 1.
Non est mihi voluntas in vobis dicit Dominus omnipotens, and sacrificium non
accipiam de manibus vestris. Quoniam ab ortu solis vsque ad occasum, nomen meum
glorificatur inter gentes, and in omni loco incensum offertur nomini meo, and
sacrificium purum. Quoniam magnum est nomen meum in gentibus, dicit Dominus
omnipotens: manifestissime significans per haec, quoniam prior quidem populus
cessabit offerre Deo: omni autem loco sacrificium offertur ei, and hoc purum,
nomen autem eius glorificatur in gentibus.

These be the words, says he, that you must fulfill in deed. Let every one
of you speak truth to his neighbor, and see that ye give quiet sentence in
your gates, and let no man keep in memory the malice of his brother. And see
that you take no false oath. For the Almighty Lord does hate all these
things. And in like manner David. What man is it, says he, that is desirous of
life, and loves to see good days? Restrain thy tongue from evil, and thy
lips that they speak no guile. Decline from evil and do good, seek after
peace and follow the same. By all which words it is manifest, that God required
of them neither sacrifice nor burnt offerings. But faith and obedience, and
righteousness, for their salvation. Even as in Oseas the Prophet also, God
teaching them his will, said: I desire rather mercy than sacrifice, and
acknowledging of God, more than burnt offerings. And our Lord also did put
them in remembrance of the same things when he said: truly if ye had known
what this means, I desire mercy rather than sacrifice: ye would never
condemn those that deserve it not. Testifying with the Prophets, that it was
the truth that they taught, and reprehending those that he spoke too, as men
that by their own fault were without understanding. Also when he gave counsel
to his Disciples, that they should offer unto God, first fruits out of his
creatures: not as though he had need thereof, but that they should neither be
unfruitful nor unthankful: he took the bread, which is of the Creature, and
gave thanks, saying. This is my body. And in like manner, he confessed, that
the Cup, which is of that creature that is among us, is his blood, and taught
a new oblation of the new Testament, which the Church receiving of the
Apostles, does in all parts of the world offer unto God, even unto him that
gives the first fruits of his own gifts in the new Testament, to be our
food, whereof in the twelve Prophets, Malachie does foreshow in this sort. I
have no pleasure in you, says the Lord almighty: and I will receive no
sacrifice at your hands. For my name is glorified among the Gentiles, even
from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, and in every place
is Incense and pure sacrifice offered unto my name. For my name is great among
the Nations, says the Lord almighty: declaring most manifestly by these
words, that the first people shall cease to offer to God: but in every place
is sacrifice offered unto him, yea, and that pure sacrifice, for his name is
glorified among the Gentiles.

Now (M. Watson) let the Christian Reader, weigh the words of Ireneus. And do
you weigh them better than you did, when you used them to prove that the Lords
supper is the sacrifice of the Church of Christ, and of our reconciliation. For
Ireneus proves that God delights in no outward sacrifices, but does by them
teach what sacrifice it is that he delights in. That is, faith, Ireneus
teaches what sacrifice God delights in.
obedience, and justice, which he would have all men to offer, as a sacrifice
of thanksgiving to God for their salvation. And when Jesus Christ did
institute his supper: he did thereby teach his disciples to offer that
sacrifice (as ye may learn in S. Augustine his sermon De sacramentis fidelium,
Citatur a Beda in Collect.
) and of the Apostles has the church learned to offer the same in all parts
of the world, which is Incense and pure sacrifice, and the glorifying of the
name of God among all Nations.

There is nothing so ancient, so profitable, WATSON. Division. 5.
necessary and so wholesome as this sacrifice is, that has been of some men,
and that of late, so assaulted, reviled, rejected, blasphemed, oppressed,
persecuted, and with such reproach and indignation banished and exiled, without
cause or any good ground why they should so have done, but that they knew
sin should decay, if that were used. And therefore intending to establishe
the Kingdom of sin, labored with all violence to subvert this enemy and
remedy against sin. Which as S. Cyprian does say, Cyprianus ser. de coena
domini.
Ad totius hominis vitam salutemque proficit, simul medicamentum and
holocaustum ad sanandas infirmitates, and purgandas iniquitates existens. Which
does profit to the life and salvation of the whole man, being both a medicine
to heal infirmities, and a sacrifice to purge iniquities.

Meaning (as I am sure you do) of the sacrifice of your Mass: CROWLEY.
there is nothing more true, The contrary of Watsons words most true.
than the contrary of that praise that you give it. As for the ground and
cause why we assault it, revile, reject, blaspheme, oppress and persecute it.
etc. it is such, that you and all your sort, are not able justly to remove.
Does it not rob Christ of his glory, in that it is made a sacrifice
propitiatory for sins? Does it not rob the people of the comfort they
should conceive by receiving that thing, which in your Mass they may but see
and worship? Has it not been the overthrow of many thousands, which being
seduced by your false teaching, have called it their maker and redeemer, and
have given unto it, the honor due to both? And where ye say that sin must
decay where it is used, I pray you how decayed sin in the Abbayes, where it
was most used? The fruits of the Mass.
Forsooth even as in Sodom, when Lots doctrine was refused. What amendment of
life wrought it in this Realm in Queen Mary's days? Forsooth even such as
the golden Calves wrought in Israel in king Ierobohams time, and Baals
sacrifices in the days of king Ahab. You say, it is an enemy and remedy
against sin, and you take record of Cyprian the holy Martyr and witness of
Christ: but if he were living, he would give you little thank to take him to
witness in so manifest an untruth. In deed Cyprian speaks reuerentlye and
truly of the holy supper of the Lord: for it is both a remedy to heal our
infirmities, and a brent offering to purge our iniquities. For (as S. Austen
says) carnal men must by the degrees and steps of sacraments be brought from
those things that be seen with the bodily eyes, August. octogint. quest. 41.
to those that be understood by the mind. And so do sacraments cure our
infirmities. And as the brent offerings, did preach to the offerers, that if
they would have their iniquities purged by Christ, they must offer themselves
wholly to God by obedience to his will: Even so does this holy supper teach us
to offer our souls and bodies in obedience to work his will, whose members we
be. Thus does it both cure our infirmities, and purge our iniquities, as
Cyprian has said in the place that you cite.

WATSON. Division. 6
This little time that I have now, I entende (God willing) to bestow in this
matter, to reduce into your remembrance the foundation and commodity of this
sacrifice of the Church, and to repel such bolts, as the foolishness of some,
and the malice of other, have shot against it, that knowing the necessity and
goodness of it, we may follow the counsel of S. Bernarde which said, Discamus
eius humilitatem, Bernardus homil. 3. super missus est.
imitemur mansuetudinem, amplectamur dilectionem, communicemus passionibus,
tauemur in sanguine eius: ipsum offeramus propitionem pro peccatis nostris,
quoniam ad hoc ipse natus and datus est nobis. Ipsum occulis patris, ipsum
offeramus and suis, quia and pater proprio filio suo non pepercit, sed pro
nobis tradidit illum etc.

Let us learn his humillitie, let us follow his meekness and gentleness,
let us embrace his love, let us communicate his passions by suffering with him,
let us be washed in his blood, let us offer him the propitiation, or a
sacrifice propitiatory for our sins: for to this end was he borne and given
to us: let us offer him to his fathers eyes, let us offer him to his own eyes,
for the father has not spared his own son, but has given him for us, and
so forth.

Your purpose is (you say) in this sermon to reduce into the remembrance of
your Auditorie, CROWLEY.
the foundation and commodity of the Mass. (For that it is that you call the
sacrifice of the Church) and to repel the bolts. etc.

As foolish and malicious as you account them that have shot boltes at your
Blackbird the Mass: yet have they bestowed them so wisely and charitably in
the defense of the true Turtle Dove, the Church of Jesus Christ, that you nor
any of your sort, never yet has been, or ever hereafter shall be, able to
repel them, as you brag that you mind to do.

As for your place of Bernarde: it might be answered with this common saying:
Bernardus non vidit omnia. Bernarde saw not all things, for his antiquity is
under five hundred years. So that it was a wonder that he saw any thing, the
time wherein he lived being so ouershadowed with the clouds of ignorance and
superstition, and he himself also being a Monk by profession.

Yet will I not so reject him, Bernard was the flower of his time.
because he was the flower of his time, and seems by his writings to see
more, than he durst well utter with his tongue or pen. And this sentence that
you cite out of his Homily, serves not so much for your purpose, as you seem
to think that it does. For what manner of speeches are these? Co^municemus
passionibus, lauemur in sanguine eius? Are they not Metaphores? For if we use
these words in their proper signification, how is it possible for us to do the
thing that Bernarde exhorts us to do? Can we by any means suffer any part
of that passion that Christ suffered in his own person? And is it possible for
us to bathe our bodies in his blood? I think you be not so mad as once to
think it. And why will you then snatch the next sentence, which is, Ipsum
offeramus. etc. Let us offer him a sacrifice propitiatory for our sins, for
to that end he was borne and given unto us, and urge that as a proper speech,
where as it is manifest, that to speak properly, it cannot be true, that any
either can or ever could, or ever shall be able to offer up Christ to his
father, but he himself only.

We therefore can offer Christ to his father none otherwise than we can bathe
our selves in his blood. That is, by believing the promise that God the father
has made therein, and by receiving the sacrament Baptism, Now we can offer
Christ to his father.
the seal of that promise on Gods behalf, and of our faith on our behalf. So
can not we otherwise offer Christ to his father: than by believing that he is
that bread of life that came from heaven, and that gave himself for the life
of the world, and by receiving that sacramental bread and wine, which he
commanded to be received in remembrance of his death and passion. Thus I
trust all indifferent men do see how you do wrest the words of Bernarde, to
make them serve your purpose.

WATSON. Division. 7.
And also, as the same Bernarde more plainly writes in an other place, saying
thus. Pauperes sumus, parum dare possumus, attamen reconciliari possumus pro
paruo illo, si volumus: totum quod dare possum, Bernar. Sermo. 1. De Epith.
miserum corpus istud est, illud si dedero satis est: si quo minus, addo and
corpus ipsius, nam illud de meo est, and meum est, paruulus enim natus est
nobis, and filius datus est nobis, De te domine suppleo, quod minus habeo in
me. O dulcissuma reconciliatio. We are poor and little can we give: yet for
that little we may be reconciled to God if we will. All that I am able to give,
is this wretched body of mine. If I give that, it is sufficient. If it be not:
I add also Christ's body, for that is mine and of mine: for a little one is
borne unto us, and the son is given unto us. O Lord, that lacks in me, I
supply of thee, O most sweetest reconciliation.

See how S. Bernarde joins the offering of our bodies and of Christ's body
together. That if the oblation of our bodies be imperfite and suffice not: the
oblation of Christ's body may fulfill and supply, that lacks in us. And to
what end? That we might be reconciled, that the body of sin might be
destroyed, that it reign not in our bodies.

And here the prayer was made.

In many words immediatlye before these that you cite: CROWLEY.
S. Bernarde proves, that our salvation comes of the merciful goodness of
God only, and not of any thing that is in us. For to that end, he cites the
name Savior: both out of the words spoken by the Angel Gabriel to the
Virgin Marie, and also out of the Angels words to Joseph, and to the
Shepheardes, declaring also the cause thereof to be, for that he should save
his people from their sins. To what use Watso^ would have Christ to serve.
But you (M. Watson) would have Bernarde to teach, that Christ serves for
none other purpose, but to be offered in the Mass, to help out with that,
that lacks in our merits. For you say, see how saint Bernarde joins the
offering of our bodies and of Christ's body together. That if the oblation of
our bodies be imperfect and suffice not: the oblation of Christ's body may
fulfill and supply, that lacks in us.

If Bernarde had been of that mind: then might it not only have been truly
said of him, Bernard saw not al things: but rather thus, Bernard was blind in
every thing. For what is more manifest, both by the scriptures and judgment of
ancient fathers: then that Christ alone is our Mediator and reconcilor to God
his father? Did not the Angel say to Joseph: he shall save his people from
their sins? In the Latin, it is saluum faciet. Math. 1.
He shall make them safe. And what is required to be done by his people
toward their salvation: if he alone shall make them safe? Again Esaias says.
Esaias. 53.
Liuore eius sanati sumus. By his stripes, are we made whole. Et disciplina
pacis nostrae, cecidit super illum. The correction that might purchase our
peace: Oseas. 13.
fell upon him. And Oseas says. O Israel, perditio tua, tantum ex me auxillium
tuum. O Israel, destruction is thine own: but thine help comes of me alone.

What can be more plainly spoken then this? And again John Baptist says.
John. 1.
Ecce qui tollit peccata mundi Behold him that takes away the sins of the
world. And shall we now set him to serve but for a shift, that when we are not
able to go through with our matters: then he must help out withal? Oh blind
Bernarde if he were such a one as Watson would have him to be, But Bernarde
was none such, Bernard was deceived in some things.
was none such, although he were deceived in somethings according to the deep
ignorance of the time he lived in. But in these words that you take hold of,
he means to teach, that for as much as there is not in us any ability at
all to satisfy for sin: we must fly to that mean that God has appointed,
even Jesus Christ, and offer him up, a sacrifice propitiatory for our sins,
not by massing, but by believing the promise of God his father made in him: and
so shall we supply that, that in us lacks altogether, and not in part. For
when we shall have done all that is given us in commandment to do: we must
say that we are bondmen that can deserve nothing. Luc. 17.
How should we then by offering up our bodies, satisfy for any part of our
sins? When we offer our bodies therefore to God in obeying his holy will: How
that which lacks in us, is supplied.
we do declare thereby, that we believe the promise of God made in his son
Christ, which is all that he requires of us, and in so doing, we supply by
Christ, the thing that was utterly lacking in us. That is, the satisfaction for
our sins.

WATSON. Division. 8.
Now entering to speak of the Sacrifice of the Church, I presuppose one thing,
which is the foundation of the same to be most certainly and constauntly
beloved of all us that be here present: Here ye prayer was made.
which is, that in the most blessed sacrament of the Aultare, is present the
true body and blood of our Savior Christ, the price of our redemption, not
in figure only, but in truth and very deed. Which the learned men call
really, and essentially, that is to say, that thing, that substance, that was
upon the Cross, is now verily present in the blessed Sacrament before we
receive it: the cause of which real presence, is the omnipotent power and will
of God, assisting the due administration of the priest, the which body and
blood we christen men receive by the service of our bodies and senses, though
not by the judgment of our senses, but only by the judgment of faith, because
it is given, not in the outward form of the self same body and blood, as it
was slain and shed upon the cross: but in the forms of our daily and special
nutriments of bread and wine, and that for sundry weighty and necessary causes,
foresene by our savior Christ.

Now you begin to build, CROWLEY.
and you presuppose the foundation to be already laid in the minds of all your
hearers, which is (as you say) that in the most blessed sacrament of the
Altar, the true body and blood of our Savior Christ is present, not in figure
only. etc.

Surely this foundation is not that, whereon S. Paul, that wise and good
builder did build, Watson and Paul build not both upon one foundation.
then the which (as he says) none can be laid, for christians to build upon.
For Christ has not taught that his Church should offer such a sacrifice as you
do teach that your Sacrament is.

Wherefore, although this foundation were laid in the hearts of all your
hearers: yet were it not sure ground to build upon, because it is beside the
Rock Christ. But I suppose, that your hearers were of three sorts. One sort I
think, had your foundation hard rammed in their hearts, another sort could not
receive any such rubbishe into their hearts, Watsons hearers were of three sorts.
as you do use to ram into your false foundation, but having already
received the Rock Christ, they cannot admit any other. But the third sort, are
like bottomless quakemires, whereon no building can stand. And many of your
hearers have since that time, when you made your Sermons: showed themselves to
be such. Wherefore your supposition seems to me to be deceived. But to your
purpose. The real and essential presence of Christ's body and blood in the
Sacrament, is the foundation of that you mind to teach in this Sermon. The
foundation of Watsons sermon.
If I can prove then, that they be not so present therein: then must you seek a
new foundation to build upon. Which thing, by the help of God, I doubt not
to do.

First, by real and essential presence, you mean such a presence, that who
so receives into his body, the visible Sacrament: must of necessity be
confessed, to receive the body and blood of Christ also, even into his body.
But that is not true. Ergo. etc.

The Mayor of this argument is your own words, and the Minor must be proved
by Scriptures and Doctors, which is easy enough to be done. First our Savior
Christ says. Whatsoever enters by the mouth, Math. 15.
goes into the belly, and is cast out into the draught: Which thing, I think,
you will not confess to be true of the body and blood of Christ. Ergo. etc.

John. 6.
Again Christ says, he that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, does
dwell in me, and has me dwelling in him: but not every one that receives
the Sacrament, dwells in Christ, and has Christ dwelling in him: Ergo. etc.

Acts. 3.
Again, Peter says that heaven must hold him, until that time come wherein
all things that the prophets have spoken, be fulfilled. The Scripture
overthrows. Watsons foundation.
Wherefore I conclude, that by the Scriptures it is manifest, that the body and
blood of Christ are not received into the bodies of men by the receiving of the
Sacrament thereof. And consequently that it is not really and essentially
present in the Sacrament.

But you are not wont to credit the Scriptures, unless you have the sayings
of the Doctors to confirm the same, using their wrytings as a touchstone to
try the Scriptures by, where as they themselves do desire to have their
writing tried by the scriptures, refusing to have credit further then they shall
be found consonant to the Scriptures.

We might therefore say, that it is more then needs, to go about to try the
touchstone by that metal that should be tried by it. Nevertheless, to let
them whose eyes ye have bleared, see how you have deceived their sight: I will
not stick to cite some sayings out of such among the Doctors, as be most
ancient and sound in opinion, whereby it may appear that they thought not as
you have taught.

Basilius Magnus, although not writing of this matter, Basilius De Spiritu
sanct. Cap. 22.
yet going about to prove the holy ghost to be God: says thus. Angelus qui
astitit Cornelio: non erat in eodem tempore etiam apud Philippum. Neque qui ab
altari Zachariam alloquebatur: eodem tempore etiam in coelo propriam sedem ac
stationem implebat. At vero Spiritus, simul in Abacuc and in Daniele in
Babilonia operari creditus est, and in Cataracta cum Hieremia esse dictus est,
and cum Ezechele in Chobar. The Angel that stood before Cornelius: was not at
ye same time with Philip also. Neither did he that from the Altar spoke unto
Zachary: at the same time occupy his own place and order in heaven. But we
believe that the holy ghost, did at one time work in Abacuc, and in Daniell
being in Babylon. And it is said that he was with Hieremie in the Dongion, and
with Ezechiell in Chobar.

Basil thinks this to be a sufficient reason to prove the holy ghost to be
God. And so will all godly men confess. For no creature can occupy more places
at one time, than one only. But you affirming Christ's body to be really
present in the sacrament: do teach that it is present in a multitude of
places at once. Ergo, Watsons doctrine denies the manhood of Christ.
you affirm it to be God, and so do ye destroy the man's nature in Christ, in
that ye confound it with the divine, contrary to that Catholic faith that
you would seem to defend, wherein we confess with Athanasius, that God and
man is but one Christ, not by confusion of substance, but by the unity of
person. This Basil is no new writer (as you know M. Watson) for he lived
about.320. years after Christ's ascension.

Origin also, somewhat more ancient, Origin in Math. 25.
for he lived about 200, years after Christ, writing upon the.25. Chapter of
Math: says thus. Quod si semper omnibus suis est presens: quomodo introducunt
cum Parabolae eius peregrinantem? Vide vt possumus soluere hoc modo quod
quaeritur. Qui enim dicit Discipulis suis, ecce vobiscum sum vsque ad

scriptum apud Iohannem, Omnis spiritus qui soluit Iesum, non est ex Deo) sed
vnicuique substantiae proprietatem reseruamus. If so be that he be always
present with all them that be his: How do his Parables bring him in as one
that is gone into a strange Country? Mark how we may answer the question
that is now moved. Certes, he that says to his Disciples, behold: I am with
you to the end of the world, and also, where two or three shall be gathered
together in my name, there am I in ye midst of them etc. And he also which
stands in the midst of them that know him not: the same is the only
begotten son of God, God the son, and the wisdom, that justice, and that
truth, that is not closed in with bodily compassing. According to the nature of
this his divinity: he is not gone into a strange Country. But as touching his
body which he has received: he is gone into a strange Country. According to
the which, he was troubled and made heavy when he said. Now is my soul
troubled. And again. My soul is sorrowful, even unto death. When we speak
thus: we do not lose in sunder the manhood of the body, which he has
received (because it is written in John, every spirit that dissolueth the
savior is not of God) but we do reserve to each substance, the property
thereof.

In these words of Origin, it is manifest, that he thought, the presence of
Christ with his, Origin against Master Watson.
to be understood of his divine nature, and his absence from them of his man's
nature. Whereupon I conclude, that Origin was not of your mind, in that you say
that Christ's body is really and essentially present in the Sacrament.

August ad Dardanu^.
Saint Austen also, who lived about.400. years after Christ's ascension, writes
thus unto Dardanus. Noli itaque dubitare, ibi nunc esse hominem Christum Iesum,
vnde venturus est. Memoriterque recole and fideliter tene Christianam
confessionem, quoniam resurrexit a mortuis, ascendit in coelum, sedet ad
dexteram Patris, nec aliunde quam inde venturus est, ad viuos mortuosque
iudicandos. Et sic venturus est (illa angelica voce testante) quemadmodum visus
est ire in coelum, id est, in eadem carnis forma atque substantia, cui profecto
immortalitatem dedit, naturam non abstulit. Secundum hanc formam putandus non
est vbique diffusus. Cauendum est enim, ne ita diuinitatem astruamus hominis:
vt veritatem corporis auferamus. Doubt not therefore, but the man Christ Jesus
is there now: from whence he shall hereafter come. And see thou reuolue in thy
mind and keep faithfully, the Christian confession, which is, that he arose
again from the dead, ascended into heaven, sits at the right hand of the
father, and that he shall come from none other place but from thence, to judge
both the quick and the dead. And as the voice of the Angel does witness, he
shall come even in such sort as he was seen go into heaven, yt is in the same
form and substance of flesh, unto which, no doubt he has given
immortality, but has not taken away the nature. And according to this form,
he is not to be thought to be spread abroad in all places. For we must beware,
that we do not so set up the divinity of the man: that we take away the truth
of the body.

These words of Austen are plain enough. But to make them more plain, he
adds. Dominus Jesus est vbique per id quod Deus: in coelo autem perid quod
homo. The Lord Jesus is every where in that he is God: but in that he is man,
he is in heaven.

Again, the same Austen, Tractatu in John. 30.
writing upon saint John's gospel says thus. Corpus Domini in quo resurrexit,
in vno loco esse opertet: veritas cius vbique diffusa est. The body of the
Lord, wherein yt he arose, must be in one place: but his truth is spread abroad
in every place.

Much more might be cited out of Austen for this matter: but this may suffice
to satisfy all reasonable men, concerning his judgment herein.

Ambrose also, who was living in S. Austens time, says thus. Ascendists and
Paulo, qui non contentus solus te sequi, nos quoque docuit quemadinodum te
sequamur, and vbi te reperire possimus dicens. Ambrosius in Lucam. lib. 10.
cap. 24.
Si ergo consurrexistis cum Christo. quae sursum sunt quaerite, vbi Christus
est ad dexteram dei sedens. Et ne oculorum magis hoc quam animorum putaremus
officium, addidit. Quae sursum sunt sapite non quae super terram, Ergo, non
supra terram, nec in terra, nec secundum carnem te quarere debemus, si volumus
inuenire. Thou did ascend in Paul's judgment also, who, not contented to
follow thee alone, has taught us also how we may follow thee, and where we may
find thee, when he says. If ye be risen together with Christ, seek those
things that are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. And
least we should think this rather to be the office of the eyes then of the
minds: he adds. Savor those things that are above, and not those things
that are on earth. If we will find him therefore we must not seek him upon
earth, neither in earth, nor after the manner of flesh.

What words can be more plain then these, or more mighty to overthrow your
foundation (M. Watson) does not Ambrose say, Ambrose overthrows Watsons
foundation.
that if we will find Christ: we must seek him in heaven, where he is sitting
at the right hand of God? Ergo, not in your bread and Wine in such sort as you
teach.

About the same time lived Cyrill also, that was Bishop of Alexandria. Cyrillus
in Job. lib. 6. cap. 14.
The same writing upon John says thus. Et si Christus corporis sui
praesentiam hinc subduxit: maiestate tamen diuinitatis semper adest, sicut ipse
a discipulis abiturus pollicetur: Ecce, ego vobiscum sum omnibus diebus, vsque
ad consummationem saeculi. Although Christ have conueighed hence the presence
of his body: yet is he always present by the Majesty of his divinity, even
as when he was departing from his Disciples he promised. Behold I am with you
every day, even to the end of the world.

Gregorius in homil. Pasch.
Gregory also says. Christus non est hic per praesentiam carnis: qui tamen
nusquam deest per praesentiam maiestatis. Christ, says he, is not here by the
presence of his flesh: which notwithstanding is absent from no place, by the
presence of his majesty.

Ad Transimundum Regem. lib. 2.
Fulgentius also, writes thus. Christus vnus, idemque homo localis ex homine,
qui est Deus immensus ex patre. Vnus idemque secundum humanam substantiam,
absens coelo, cum esset interra: and derelinquens terram cum ascer disset in
coelum. Christ is but one, and the self same is placible man of man, which is
of his father God that can not be measured. One and the same, as touching his
humane substance: was absent from heaven when he was on earth, and leaving the
earth when he ascended into heaven. The last of these writers hitherto cited:
lived within.500. years after Christ.

And Beda, who lived about.730. years after Christ's ascencion, writing upon
these words Ecce ego vobiscum sum. etc. Beda in Math. cap. 28.
Behold, I am with you.etc. says thus. Ipse Deus and homo est, assumptus est
humanitate, quam de terra susceperat: manet cum sanctus in terra diuinitate,
qua terram pariter implet and coelum. He that is both God and man, is in his
humanity that he took of the earth, assumpted up: but in his divinity
wherewith he fills both heaven and earth, he does remain with his Saints on
earth.

These testimonies of Scriptures and holy fathers may suffice, I suppose, to
shake your foundation so, The Scriptures and Doctors have shaken Watsons
foundation.
that no wise man will be bold to join with you in building thereon, unless
it be such as you were when you made this Sermon, what you be now, I know
not.

But least you should do, as commonly your sort use to do, that is to report
that we teach that the Sacraments of Christ, are but bare and naked signs: I
let you understand, that we confess, and are ready to confirm with our
blood (if God so will) that Jesus Christ is verily and in deed present, in the
right and due administration and receiving of his Sacraments. And that the
worthy receyuers: do verily and in deed, How Christ is present in his
Sacraments.
receive Jesus Christ himself. But that this is done substantially, and
really, that is, in the manner of the receiving of a bodily substance or thing
into men's bodies: that we deny, and trust we shall be able to fight against,
even to the death.

Our receiving of Christ therefore, is spiritual into the soul by faith: and
into the body or by the senses, sacramentally, that is in such sort as by the
receiving of Sacraments, we may receive the things signified by the same. In
Baptism therefore, we do by believing the promise of God, made in Christ,
receive him into our souls, to wash and purge the same of all sin: and the
very senses of our bodies do understand the same, when we do by them
consider the nature and use of the creature water, wherein our Savior Christ
has instituted that holy Sacrament, which is to purge and cleanse from all
filth, all those things that be washed therein. In like manner in the Lords
supper, when we believe the words of Christ written by Saint John, Ego sum
panis ille qui de coelo descendi: qui edit de hoc pane viuet in aeternum, I am
that bread which came down from heaven, John. 6.
he that eats of this bread shall live for ever: then do we by faith receive
Christ into our souls, and the very senses of our bodies do perceive, and
our common sense does understand, that as the creatures, bread and wine,
wherein this Sacrament is instituted, do strengthen and cheer men's hearts:
even so the body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, do
strengthen, comfort, and make cheerful the soul of man.

And further, we do even sensibly perceive in Baptism, our burial with
Christ, to the world and worldly delights: and our resurrection with him to
newness of life. And in the Lords supper, our knitting together into one
body, whereof Christ is the head. According to that which Austen teaches in
that sermon that he intitleth. Of the sacraments of the faithful. We teach not
therefore that they be vain and empty signs: August ad Iaenuarium lib. 1.
but we hold that they be most effectual in signification, as Austen writes to
Ianuarius.

Now, where as you say, that by the power of almighty God, assisting the due
administration of the Priest, Christ is become present in the sacrament after
your manner: we know no such due administration, as you mean of, I am sure.
That is dashed full of crossings and trurnings, doukyngs and starings in
Maskers apparel. But we know and acknowledge, that order of ministration, that
Christ appointed, and the Apostles used, to be the due order of ministration.
And ye Gods almighty power does assist that ministration, so that the worthy
receyuers, that is, such as be members of Christ's body: are spiritually and
sacramentally partakers of Christ, and do receive into their souls whole
Christ, both God and man, according as the holy scriptures, and holy Fathers
do teach, without any transubstantiating or changing of the substaunces of
the creatures, bread and wine.

WATSON. Division. 9.
For seeing the substance of our Sacrifice of the new Testament, is the very
real and natural body of Christ, as may be proved by many Authorities.
Cyprian. li. 2. Epist. 3.
Saint Cyprian says: In sacrificio quod Christus est, non nisi Christus
sequendus est. In that Sacrifice that is Christ, no man is to be followed but
Christ. Here he says, that Christ is the Sacrifice that we offer to almighty
God.

Also Saint Basyl, writes in his form of Mass: Basil. in Missa
Tues qui offers, and offerris, and qui suscipis and impartis Christ deus
noster. O Christ our God, thou art he that both do offer, and is offered,
that both give the offering and receaueth. Saint Basyll by this means that
the Sacrifice, which the Church offered to God, is Christ himself, who in that
he is the head of his body the Church, is one offerer with the Chuch, and so is
both offerer and offered, as Basyll says.

Likewise Saint Ambrose writing of the invention of the bodies of two glorious
Martirs Geruasius and Prothasius, and of the burying of them under the altar,
says thus: Amb. lib. 10. Epist. 85.
Succedant victimae triumphales in locum, vbi Christus hostia est, sed ille
super altar qui pro omnibus passus est, isti sub altari, qui illius redempti
sunt passione. Let these triumphing Sacrifices (meaning the bodies of the
Martirs) go into the place where Christ is a Sacrifice. But Christ is a
Sacrifice above the altar, who suffered for all men, these two under the
altar, that were redeemed by his passion.

Of this place I note my purpose, which is, that the Sacrifice of the Church
and new Testament, is the very real body and blood of our Savior Christ,
which is also testified by Chrysostom in his Homely he writes of the praise
of God in these words. Chrysostom. hom. de Laud Dei.
Vereamini mensam quaue desuper victima illa iacet Christus scilicet qui nostri
causa occisus est Fear and reverence that table, above the which lies that
Sacrifice (that is to say Christ) which for our cause was slain.

By which words Chrysostom declares his faith, that the Sacrifice of the
Church is Christ, and also that Christ is not only in heaven, as some men
damnably bears you in hand, but is placed lying above the Fable of the
aultare as the substance of our Sacrifice.

And in an other Homely he writes. Idem homil. De En^^^ijs.
Mensa myst^rijs instructa est, and agnus dei pro te immolatur. The Table is
furnished with mysteries, and the Lamb of God for thee is offered, teaching us
that the holy mysteries wherewith the Table of our altar is furnished be the
body and blood of Christ (that is to say) the Lamb of God, which is also then
offered for us.

August. lib 9 Confess. Ca. 12.
Saint Augustine is full of such sayings: as writing of his mothers death, how
that he wept nothing for her all the time the Mass was said for her Soul,
which he expresses by these words. Cum offerretur pro ea sacrificium praecij
nostri. When the Sacrifice of our price was offered for her.

I leave out all the rest of the sentence contented to allege only this, that
proves the sacrifice, which is offered by the Priest for the dead to be our
price, which is and can be nothing else, but the body and blood of Christ,
which he gave upon the cross, as the price of our redemption.

August. lib. Senten, prosp.
But playnest of all he writes in a Book entitled. Liber Sententiarum
prosperi. Which Book is alleged of Gratian, in the decrees in these words.
Hoc est quod dicimus, quod modis omnibus approbare contendimus sacrificium
Ecclesiae duobus confici, duobus constare, visibili elementorum specie, and
inuisibili Domini nostri Jesus Christi corpore and sanguine, and Sacramento, and
re Sacrame^ti, id est, corpore Christi. This is that we say, that we labor to
prove by all means that the Sacrifice of the Church is made and consists of
two things, of the visible form of the elements and of the invisible body
and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ both that outward Sacrament and the thing
or substance of the Sacrament, that is the body of Christ. These words need
no declaring but poynting: and for that cause why should I tarry in this point
any longer, seeing that our Books be full of such like authorities.

Therefore as I began seeing the substance of our Sacrifice of the new
Testament, is the very real and natural body of Christ, if this body be not
present in the Sacrament as the enemies of Christ's Cross, and the destroyers
of our faith falsely pretend: then be we christen men left altogether
desolate without any Sacrifice private unto us, for both the Sacrifice of
Christ upon the cross, and also the inward Sacrifice of man's heart be not
private but common to us, and to all faithful men from the beginning of the
world to the last end.

All these words are to prove, CROWLEY.
that we (whom you call the enemies of Christ's Cross and destroyers of your
faith) do take away from the Church of Christ, that sacrifice, that they may
and ought continually to offer to God: and leave them in worse case then were
the Jews or any other sect, except the Mahumetans, for they only are without a
peculier sacrifice to offer to their God. Your Argument, when the flowers of
Rhetoric be taken from it: is in this form. Seeing that the substance of our
sacrifice, is the very real and natural body of Christ, they that deny it
to be in such sort present, do deny the Church to have any Sacrifice to offer
to God: But the Protestants do deny it to be in such sorts present: Ergo,
they deny the Church to have any sacrifice to offer to God.

To prove the Mayor proposition of this Argument: Cyprian. lib. 2. Ep 3.
you make a long parenthesis. And first you begin with the words of Cyprian.
In sacrificio quod Christus est: non nisi Christus sequendus est. In that
Sacrifice that is Christ: no man is to be followed but Christ. True it is, that
in the third Epistle of his second Book: Saint Cyprian has those words
that you cite. But that he meant by those words to affirm, that Christ's real
and natural body is present in the sacrament, I deny, and doubt not to be able
to stand to that denial, against all that can be justly proved by the words of
Cyprian, in that place or any other of his works. And least you should think
that of an obstinacy, I do without good ground deny that I am not able to
answer: I will show you what moves me to deny that which you affirm.

First, the same Cyprian in the same Epistle says thus. Admonitos autem nos
scias, vt in Calice offerendo, dominica traditio seruetur, neque aliud fiat a
nobis, quam quod pro nobis Dominus prior fecit. Vt Calix qui in commemorationem
eius offertur: mixtus vino offeratur. Nam cum dicat Christus, Ego sum vitis
vera, sanguis Christi non aqua est vtique, sed vinum. Nec potest videri sanguis
cius, quo redempti and viuificati sumus esse in Calice: quando vinum desit
calici, quo Christi sanguis ostenditur, qui scripturarum omnium sacramento ac
testimonio praedicatur. Ye may understand (says Cyprian to Coecilius) that
we are warned, that in the offering of the Cup, we observe the Lords
tradition, and that we do nothing therein, other then that which the Lord did
for us before. That the Cup which is offered in remembrance of him, be offered
being mixed with Wine. For when Christ says, I am a very Vine, doubtless
then the blood of Christ is not water, but Wine. Neither can it seem, that his
blood wherewith we were redeemed and quickened, is in the Cup: when it wants
Wine, whereby Christ's blood is set forth and showed, which is by the Sacrament
and testimony of all the Scriptures preached abroad.

Again, the fame Cyprian says in the same Epistle. Lauabit in vino stolam
suam, and in sanguine vnae amictum suum. Quando autem sanguis vuae dicitur:
quid aliud quam vinum dominici sanguinis ostenditur? He shall wash his robe in
Wine, and his apparel in the blood of the Grape. And when mention is made of
the blood of the Grape: what other things is showed, then the Wine of the Cup
of the Lords blood?

And after a few words, the same Cyprian says thus. Vini vtique mentio est:
and ideo ponitur, vt Domini sanguis vino intelligatur. Et quod in Calice
dominico postea manifestatum est: prophetis annumiantibus praedicatur. Mention
is made of the Wine (says Cyprian) and for this cause is it done, that the
Lords blood might be understood by the Wine. And that thing that was
afterward manifestly showed in the Lords Cup: was before preached when the
Prophets showed forth the same.

And in the same Epistle, after he has spoken of the words of our Savior
Christ, written in the.26. chapter of Saint Math. Gospel: he says. Qua in
part inuenimus, Calicem mixtum fuisse quem Dominus obtulit, and vinum fu sse
quod sanguinem suum dixit. In which part (says Cyprian, speaking of the Cup)
we find that the cup, which the Lord offered, was mixed: and that the thing
which he called his blood, was Wine.

And again, after he has spoken of the words of the Apostle, he says. Miror
satis vnde hoc vsurpatum sit: vt contra euangelicam and apostolicam
disciplinam, quibusdam in locis, aqua offeratur in dominico calice, quae sola
Christi sanguinem non possit exprimere. I maruayle much (says Cyprian) how it
comes to pass, that contrary to the doctrine both of the gospel and of the
Apostle: water is in certain places offered in the Lords cup, which being but
water alone, can not express the blood of Christ. These sayings of Cyprian,
being written in the same Epistle yt you cite: Cyprians words in the same
Epistle that watson cites: make against him.
do cause me to deny that which you affirm. For he says. The Wine of the cup
of the lords blood is showed forth. The lords blood is understand by the Wine.
And that it was Wine that he called his blood. And last of all, that water
alone could not express the blood of Christ.

No man that is not blinded by affection, will say, that Cyprian meant in that
Epistle to teach, that Christ's real and natural body is present in the
Sacrament, otherwise then spirituallye and sacramentally. But I marvel much
that you were so blind: when you read that Epistle: that you could not see
these plain words of Cyprian, even in the last sentence of the Epistle.
Religioni igitur nostrae congruit and timori, and ipsi loco atque officio
sacerdotij nostri, frater charisme, in Dominico Calice miscendo and offerendo:
custodire dominicae traditionis veritatem. Et quod prius apud quosdam videtur
erratum, Domino monente corrigere. Vt cum in claritate sua, and maiestate
coelesti venire coeperit: inueniat nos tenere quod monuit, obseruare quod
docuit, facere quod fecit. It agrees (says Cyprian) with our religion, fear,
and place of priestly office (most dearly beloved brother) that in the
mingling and offering up of the Lords Cup, we keep the truth of the Lords
tradition: and that we do by the warning that the Lord gives, correct that
thing wherein we see that other have heretofore erred. That when he shall begin
to come in his own brightness and heavenly Majesty: he may find that we
hold fast that whereof he gave us warning, observe that which he taught us, and
do that which he did.

Such words, as these, are not for you to look upon. For they will bid you
leave of your masking garments in your ministration, and to set aside your
hallowed cups, Vestiments, Altars, and Superaltaries, with all your crossings,
turnings and half turnings, with the reast of your Apishe toys. For Christ
neither taught nor used any of all those things. But when Cyprian says. In
sacrificio quod Christus est, non nisi Christus sequendus est: In that
Sacrifice which is Christ, none must be followed but Christ: the first part of
the sentence must serve your purpose, to prove, that the real and natural
body and blood of Christ is the substance of the sacrifice of the church, and
that the same is really and substantially present in the sacrament thereof: but
the later part of ye same sentence, must not put us in mind, to do in the
ministration thereof, that which Christ did and commanded us to do.

The words that Watson cyteth, make nothing for him.
Thus without shame you cite that for your purpose, which when it is taken whole
together, makes manifestly against you. Yea the very first part of that
sentence, which you apply to your purpose, when it is well weighed, makes
nothing for you. For what is more common among the fathers, then to call the
signs by the names of those things that they do signify?

Chrysostom. in Epist. ad Heb. homil. 17.
And does not Chrysostom speaking of the same sacrament, say thus? No^ aliud
sacrificium, sicut pontifex, sed idipsum semper facinus: magis autem
recordatione^ sacrificij operamur. We do not (says Chrysostom) make another
sacrifice, as the high Priest does, but always one: yea, we do rather make a
remembrance of a sacrifice. By these words of Chrysostom it appears, that
though the fathers used to call the sacrament of Christ's body a sacrifice:
yet they understood it to be but the remembrance of that sacrifice that Christ
offered on the cross once for all.

I would not gladly diminishe the authority of Cyprian or any other ancient
writer: but I am sure, you your self (M. Watson) will not build upon every
sentence of Cyprian, as you do upon this: For then could you not set your
holy father of Rome, so high above all the Bishops of christendom as you do.
Cyprian. li. 4. Epist. 2.
Look in the fourth book of his Epistles and the second Epistle, where you
shall find these words. Ac si minus sufficiens Episcoporum in Africa numerus
videbitur, etiam Romae super hac rescripsimus, Equality of Bishops by Cyprians
judgment.
ad Cornelium collegam nostrum, qui and ipse cum plurimis coepiscopis habito
concilio etc. And if the number of Bishops in Africa (says Cyprian) shall seem
to small, I have written to Rome also concerning this matier, even to Cornelius
our fellow in office, who also holding a counsel with many bishops joined with
him. etc. This Cornelius, whom Cyprian calls his fellow officer: was Bishop
of Rome, when Cyprian wrote these words. Yet I think you will not gather
hereof, that there was an equality betwixt them: unless you mind now at the
last, to deny the supremacye of your holy father. And yet you may a great
deal more justly gather that upon these words, then that which you would
maintain, of the other. Yea I suppose that you and all your fellows, are not
able to prove, that Cyprian meant not to teach an equality amongst all those
Bishops that he speaks of. But whatsoever he meant in this place or any other:
it becomes us to follow the rule that he gives, Cyprian lib. 2. Ep. 3.
in understanding the words that he or any other ancient father has left in
writing. Si solus Christus audiendus est (says Cyprian) non debemus attendere
quid aliquis ante nos faciendum putauerit: sed quid qui ante omnes est,
Christus prior fecerit. Neque enim hominis consuetudinem sequi oportet, sed Dei
veritatem. A rule to be followed in the reading of Fathers.
If Christ only be to be harkened unto, we must not mark (says Cyprian) what
any man before us has thought meet to be done: but what Christ, which was
before al, has done before us. Neither ought we to follow the custom of men,
but the truth of God. This is a perfect rule, meet to be followed of all men in
the reading of the ancient fathers wrytings.

Then come you to Basils Mass where (as you say) are written these words. Tu
es qui offers etc. O Christ our God, thou art he. etc. As for your manner of
Englishing of Basils words: I leave to you and your Printer to amend. In whom
the fault is, I know not. It shall suffice that I answer your matter.

First (with your leave M. Watson) you belie Saint Basils form of Mass. For
if that be his yt was imprinted at Andwarp. Anno. 1562. out of an old Book of
the Latin translation (as the Printer says) then is there no such matter as
this that you cite, in all S. Basils form of Mass. But S. Chrysostomes Mass,
translated by Leonhardus Thuscus, has words in the same sense that these be
that you father upon Basils Mass. The words be these, Concede a me peccatore
and indigno famulo tuo, offerri tibi haec sacramenta: tu enim es offerens and
oblatus, suscipiens and distributus, Christus Deus noster. If I might be put in
trust to translate these words into English: I would say thus. Grant that I
being a sinner, and thine unworthy servant, may offer unto thee these
sacraments: for thou being Christ our God, art he which art ye offerer, and art
offered, which art he that do receive and art distributed.

Thus much have I done for you (M. Watson) to help to save your credit, least
some of your friends should begin to mislyke with you, for cyting matter that
is no where to be found. For though your father Chrysostomes words upon Basil,
they can bear with you well enough. Yea though you do rack them a little to
serve your purpose.

Chrysostomes and Basils judgment can not enforce us to grant master Watsons
conclusion.
But this one thing I do much marvel at: that this Mass could never be
found in Chrysostomes works, as they be set forth in tomes till now of
late. But grant this to be the judgment of Chrysostom and Basil both: shall
we therefore be enforced to grant that which you do thereof infer? I trow
not. May not Chrysostom offer the sacraments to Christ, but he must offer
Christ himself to himself? I think it is no strange manner of speech, to
say, that those which preach the word and minister the sacraments, do offer
the word and sacraments to God. As may plainly appear, to as many as will
with indifferent judgment, read that which is written Malachiae. 1. and
Acts. 13.

And who doubts that Christ did once offer himself for our sins, and does
still offer himself to his Father (for with God nothing is past) a Mediator
and Advocate for us, 1. Epist. 2.
as Saint John writes. And why should not he therefore be called both the
offerer and the thing offered, although he be not offered by the Priest in his
Mass? Yea, and he receives at our hands our thanks giving, when we make our
bodies, a living, holy, and acceptable sacrifice to God: and why may it not be
said, that it is he that receives? And in taking our nature upon him, he gave
himself to us, and we by faith are made partakers of him: and why should it
not be said, that it is he that is distributed?

But what needs all this a do, in seeking a good meaning in those words
that be of none authority at all. The three forms of Masses, feigned.
If Chrysostom or Basil, had written any such form of Mass: the same would
have been found in their works, or followed of some Churches. But neither of
both is: Ergo, it is plain that they never did write any such. And as for the
fable of Saint Iameses Mass: all men may deride both the folly of the
invention of it, and of all such as esteem it as his.

And yet I must by the way, Against private Mass.
note the blindness of our Papists, which make so much of that, which
overthrows one of the chief points that they maintain so stoutly, that is
their private Mass. For all these three forms of Masses, do appoint the
distribution to be made to all that be present.

Let us now see, what you have found in Saint Ambrose. Ambr. li. 10. Epist.
85.
He says. Let the triumphant sacrifices which were redeemed. etc. And of this
do you note your purpose, that is, that the substance of the Sacrifice of the
Church, is the very real body and blood of our savior Christ.

I will not trouble the reader with seeking any good meaning in these words
which you father upon Ambrose. For as Erasmus does well note in the beginning
of the third tome of the works of Ambrose, wherein this Epistle is written:
there is no cause why a man should think that Ambrose was the Author of any
of the Sermons. Orations, or Epistles contained in that tome. The words of
Erasmus be these. Tertius hic Tomus, Erasmus his judgment upon the third
tome of Ambrose.
exhibebit orationes, Epistolas and conciones ad Populum breues, quas
supposititias esse nihil addubito Nihil enim in his Ambrosianae venae. etc.
Thus says Erasmus to the Reader. This third tome, shall exhibit unto thee,
Orations, Epistles, and short Sermons made to the people, which I doubt not but
they are falsely fathered upon Ambrose, for in them there is no whit of
Ambroses vein. Do you therefore conclude upon them what you will for your
purpose, it will have no credit with wise men. But now let us see what you
have found in Chrysostom, in his Homily De Laud Dei. Watson leaves out that
should make against himself.
Vereamini inquam vereamini. etc. Here you leave out these words Cuius omnes
sumus participes. Whereof we all are partakers. What you mean by this may
easily be coniectured, for these words that you have left out, do make
manifestly for the distribution of the Sacrament, to as many as shall be
present at the ministration thereof. But you might not suffer your hearers to
understand so much of the usage of the Church in Chrysostomes time: least they
should think the Popes Church did wrong in maintayning the private Mass.

In Epist. ad hehr. homil. 17.
But what should you win by these words, if they were even so as you do cite
them? does not the same Chrysostom, as I have cyted his words before, plainly
affirm, that they do in that Sacrifice rather make a remembrance of a
Sacrifice, August ad Bonifacium Epist. 23.
then a Sacrifice it self? And is it not a common thing among the fathers, to
call the Sacraments by the names of those things whereof they be Sacraments?
Your conclusion therefore cannot follow upon these premises.

Chrysostom. homili. De Encenijs.
Again, Chrysostom has said (say you) that the table is furnished with
mysteries. etc. And here also you leave out those words that should give light
to the understanding of Chrysostomes his meaning. These words I speak (says
Chrysostom) to those persons which do leave the communion and congregation of
Saints: and are occupied in the conuenticles of vain talk, even at the very
hour of the terrible and mystical table. O thou man, what do thou? did
thou not make a promise to the Priest which said, lift up your minds and
hearts, and thou saydest, we have them lifted up to the Lord? Art thou not
ashamed and abashed? And even the same hour, thou art found a liar. O good
God. The table is furnished with mysteries, and the Lamb of God is offered for
thee, the Priest sorroweth for thee, the blood flows from the table. The
Seraphins are present, covering their faces with six wings, all the
spiritual powers, do with the Priest, pray for thee, the spiritual fire
comes down from heaven, the blood in the cup, is for thy purification,
drawn out of the undefiled side: and art thou not ashamed, abashed and
confounded: neither do thou make God merciful unto thee?

Now (M. Watson) let us see how these words of Chrysostom may seem to
serve your purpose. Chrysostom has to do with those men, that leaving the
communion and congregation of holy men, do in the time of the ministration of
the mysteries of our salvation, give themselves to vain iangeling: and may he
not use such figurative speeches, but his words must by and by, be snatched,
Watson does snatch a word for his purpose.
to maintain the real presence of Christ in the Sacrament? If you will needs
have Chrysostom to use no figure in these words (the Lamb of God is offered
for thee) then let him use no figure in the words that follow after
immediately. The Priest sorroweth for thee, the spiritual blood flows from
the holy table. And the Seraphins stand there covering their faces with six
wings. etc. Which thing if you will grant: then must every Priest in his
Mass, be sorrowful for those that babble when he is at his Mass. And he must
over topple his cup, that the spiritual blood may flow of from the holy
table. etc. And the blood in the Chalice must be sucked out of the undefiled
side.

It is much to be maruayled, that you (M. Watson) when you did read this place,
did not perceive, what figure Chrysostom uses here. But it is to be thought,
that you saw it well enough, but would not be known of it, for you knew that
your Auditory would not charge you with the matter: And as for us that were
then beyond the Seas: you supposed that we should never come to try the
matter with you by hand blows, and therefore you were the more bold, to pick
out a few words out of the midst of Chrysostomes sayings, and apply them
pretily to your purpose. As though Chrysostom had meant by them to teach, that
the real and natural body of Christ, Chrysostoms meaning.
is really and substantially offered by the Priest in his Mass. Where as
Chrysostomes meaning was, to strike a reverent fear into the minds of his
hearers, and to move them to have their minds and hearts lifted up to God:
whilst the holy mysteries of the body and blood of Christ, should be in
ministering and receiving.

And that this was his meaning it does plainly appear, in his words in the
same place, when he says. Did thou not make promise to the Priest, which
said, lift up your minds and hearts: and thou saydest, we have them lifted up
to the Lord? And in the very same hour, thou art found a liar.

But you have Saint Austen to take your part, both in his.ix. Book of
Confessions, and also of the sentences of Prosper. Yea he is full of such
sayings (say you) but you tell us not where, more then in these two places. I
will desire the reader therefore, to think that this is but your brag, till
you bring forth more store of that you say Austen has in such plenty. But
let us weigh these two places of Austen, and see how they may serve your
purpose against us, and not against Austen himself in his other writings.

First, for answer to that which you cite out of the.ix. book, and twelfe
Chapter of his Confessions: I refer the learned reader, to that which the
same Austen writes in the Chapter next following. And that such as have not
Saint Austens works may see his words: I will here set them in writing, as
they are there to be read. August. li. 9. Confess. ca. 13.
Nanque illa, imminente die resolutionis suae, non congitauit suum corpus
sumptuose contegi, aut condiri aromatibus, aut monumentum electum concupiuit,
aut curauit sepulchrum patrium. Non ista mandauit nobis: sed tantummodo
memoriam sui ad altar tuum fieri desiderauit, cui nullius diei
praeteronissione seruierat, vnde sciret dispensari victimam sanctam, qua
deletum est chirographum quod erat contrarium nobis, qua triumphatus est hostis
computans delicta nostra, and quaerens quid obijciat, and nihil inueniens in
illo in quo vincimus. Quis ei refundet innocentem sanguinem? Quis ei restituet
precium quo nos emit, vt nos auferat ei? Ad cuius precij nostri sacramentum:
ligauit ancilla tua animam suam vinculo fidei. Saint Austen speaking of his
mother Monica, says thus unto God. When the day of her resolution was at
hand: she had no mind to have her body sumteously buried, or to be embaulmed
with Spices, neither did she desire to have a fine or gorgious Tumbe, or to be
buried in her Country. She gave us no charge concerning these matters, but
her only desire was, that she might be had in remembrance at thine altar,
whereunto she had given her self in service every day contynually, from which
she knew, that the holy slain offering, whereby was blotted out the hand
writing that was against us, was distributed: whereby that enemy that numbreth
our sins, and seeks what he may object against us, and finds nothing in
him in whom we overcome: is triumphed over. Who shall pour out innocent blood
to him again? Who shall restore to him the price wherewith he bought us, that
he may take us away from him? Unto the Sacrament of which price: thy
handemayden did tie her soul with the bond of faith.

If you would have weighed this place well: you would not have cyted the other
for such purpose as you did. Yea, you would have passed it over (I trow) for
it marreth a great part of your market. Saint Austen says here, that his
mother knew, that the holy slain sacrifice, was daily distributed at the
altar. It is plain therefore by these words, that there was no private Mass
then, but Communion, Austen expounded by himself.
which thing makes very evil for your purpose. And in the later end of
those words, Saint Austen does plainly declare, in what meaning he wrote
those other words that you cite. For the thing that he spoke of before: he
does here call Precij nostri sacramentum. The sacrament of our price.

As touching the place of Austen, in his book of the Sentences of Prosper: ye
do well to confess that it was cited by Gratian. For it will be as hard for
you to find it in Saint Austens works, as to find burning fire in the
bottom of the Sea, yea, or to find that meaning in any part of his works. It
is an Austen of Gratians own making that wrote those words, and not Austen
the Bishop of Hippo. But yet if you had read ye gloss of that text: you would
not I think, have made so great account of that place. For it says thus. In
tertia part, Watson will none of this gloss.
quod coeleste sacramentum quod est in altari: improprie dicitur Corpus
Christi, sicut Baptismus improprie dicitur fides. In the third part, that the
heavenly sacrament that is on the altar, is improperly called the body of
Christ: even as baptism is improperly called faith. If this gloss do not
fight with the text: then does not this place make so much for your purpose, as
you would have it to seem to make for it.

And because ye make mention of Prosper: let us see what he says in his.339.
sentence taken out of Austen. Prosper sentencia. 339.
Qui discordat a Christo, nec carnem eius manducat, nec sanguinem bibit: etiam
si tantae rei sacramentu^, ad iudicium suae praesumtionis, quotidie
indifferenter accipiat. He that agrees not with Christ, does neither eat his
flesh, nor drink his blood: although he do daily without regard, receive
the sacrament of so great a thing, to the condemnation of his own presumption.

In this one sentence is enough to satisfy, as many as would be satisfied of
the opinion of Austen and Prosper. And that Austen is so far of from being
full of such sayings as you do boast that he is: that he speaks fully and
plainly the contrary of that which you hold, in more places then one or two.

August. De Ciuit. Dei. lib. 21. ca. 25.
First he says thus. Qui manducat meam carnem and bibit meum sanguinem, in me
manet and ego in eo. Ostendit quid sit, non sacramentotenus, sed reuera corpus
Christi manducare, and eius sanguinem bibere. Hoc est enim in Christo manner,
vt in illo maneat and Christus. Sic enim hoc dixit, tanquam diceret. Qui non in
me manet, and in quo ego non maneo: non se dicat, aut existimat, manducare
corpus meum, aut bibere sanguinem meum. etc. He that eats my flesh and
drinks my blood, does dwell in me and I in him. He does show what it is, not
in sacrament only, but in deed to eat the flesh of Christ and drink his
blood. That is, so to dwell in Christ: that Christ may dwell in him. For he
spoke those words, even as though he should have said thus. Let not that man
that dwells not in me, nor has me dwelling in him: think that he does eat
my body or drink my blood. etc.

Idem. In. Ioh. Tract. 26.
And again upon the same words he says. Hoc est ergo manducare illam escam,
and illum bibere potum: in Christo manner, and illum in se manentem habere. Ac
per hoc, qui non manet in Christo, and in quo non manet Christus: proculdubio,
nec manducat spiritaliter carnem eius, nec bibit eius sanguinem: licet
carnaliter and visibiliter, premat dentibus, sacramentum corporis and sanguinis
Christi. Sed magis tantae rei sacramentum, adiudicium sibi manducat and bibit.
etc. This is therefore to eat that meat and drink that drink: to dwell in
Christ, and to have Christ dwelling in him. And by this, he that dwells not
in Christ, and in whom Christ dwells not: without doubt he does neither eat
his flesh nor drink his blood, spiritually: although he do fleshely and
visibly crushe in his teeth, the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ: But
he does rather eat and drink the Sacrament of so great a thing, to his own
condemnation.

Again he says. Si enim sacramenta, quandam similitudinem earum rerum, quarum
sacramenta sunt, non haberent: omnino sacramenta non essent. Ex hac autem
similitudine: Idem. Ad Bonifacium. Epist. 23.
plerumque etiam ipsarum rerum nomina accipiunt. Sicut ergo, secundum quendam
modum, sacramentum corporis Christi, corpus Christi est: sacramentum sanguinis
Christi, sanguis Christi est: ita sacramentum fidei, fides est. etc. For if the
sacraments, had not a certain similitude or likeness, of those things whereof
they be Sacraments: they could not be Sacraments at all. And of this
similitude, they do for the most part, take the names of those things whereof
they be sacraments. Even as therefore, the sacrament of the body of Christ, is
after a certain manner the body of Christ, and the sacrament of his blood, is
his blood: so the sacrament of faith, is faith. etc.

By these places, it is plain, Whereof Austen is full.
that Saint Austen is not so full of such sayings as you cite out of his
Confessions. etc: but rather that he is full of Sentences to the contrary of
that which you would confirm by his words.

Why should I tarry any longer therefore, in aunswering this point, seeing the
ancient fathers books be full of good matter, against your doctrine? I
conclude therefore, that as you understand by substance: so is not Christ the
substance of our sacrifice of the new Testament, neither is that our
sacrifice, that you do boast so much of. But our sacrifice of the new
Testament is, our faith in Christ, and our obedience to his word (as I have
showed before) and this sacrifice is acceptable in Christ, and therefore, and
in that sense, Christ is the substance of our Sacrifice, notwithstanding that
he is not after your manner present in his sacrament. Neither is it any
inconvenience, What the sacrifice of the new Testament is.
that we have not any sacrifice, private to our selves and not common to all
the faithful that have been before us, and shall be after us. For we are all
one Church, and saved by one sacrifice propitiatory, which Christ offered once
for all: and why should not one sacrifice of thanks to God, be general to us
all? unless you will have, that every age should have a sacrifice by it self.

And furthermore, WATSON. Division. 10.
seeing a Sacrifice is an outward protestation of our inward faith and
devotion, if we christen men now have no sacrifice private unto us: then be we
the most miserable men that ever were, being without any kind of religion.
For take away our sacrifice, and take away our religion, Cyprianus. Sermo. De
Caena.
as S. Cyprian confuting the carnal thoughts of the Capernaits, that thought
they should have eaten Christ's flesh either roasted or sod, and so should have
consumed it to nothing: writes thus. Cum illius personae caro si in frustra
partiretur non omni humano generi posset sufficere, qua semel consumpta
videretur religio interisse, cui nequaquam vlterius victima superesset. Seeing
that if the flesh of his person were divided into pieces, it could not
suffice all mankind to eat upon, which flesh after it were once clean wasted
and consumed, our religion might likewise seem to perish and be destroyed,
which had no more any sacrifice remaining. Whereupon I conclude, that if we
have not Christ's body and blood present in the sacrament for our external
sacrifice, whereby we may mitigate and please almighty God, and obtain
remission of sin and spiritual grace and gifts: then should we be no better
then the Turks, seeing all nations from the beginning of the world, both
Gentiles and Jews have had one kind of outward Sacrifice, to declare and
express their inward devotion and religion, either to the true God of heaven,
or to such as they fantasied or feyned to be Gods saving only the Turks, (as
Petrus Cluniacensis writes) whereby it appears, that this sect that denies
and destroys the Mass, which is the Sacrifice of the Church, is verily the
sect of Mahumet, preparing a way for the Turk to ouerrunne all Christendom,
as he has done a great piece already.

For what could the Turk do more against our says, if he did overcome us,
beside our thraldom and tirannicall oppression, but as these men do now to
take away our sacraments and sacrifice, and to leave us nothing but the bare
name of Christ, and if there be any good man, that has true religion in his
heart, to compel him to keep it within him, that he shall not express it
outwardly? and in very deed diverse notable and godly writers at this day, call
this heresy against the sacrifice of the Church which Luther first began and
most maintained, by this name Secta Mahumetica, the sect of Mahomet.

As in your former reason speaking of the substance of the sacrifice of the
Church you have subtly concluded, CROWLEY.
that we spoil the Church of Christ of her sacrifice, because we deny that
Christ is really and substantially present in the sacrament of his body and
blood: even so you go about now to conclude as subtly against us, by the
definition of a sacrifice. You reason after this manner. Seeing a sacrifice is an
outward protestation of our inward faith and devotion, without which there is
no religion: those that do take away our sacrifice, do take away our
Religion. But these heretics that do deny and destroy the Mass, do take
away our sacrifice: Ergo, they spoil us of our Religion.

Saint Austen does define a sacrifice something otherwise. De Ciuitate Dei.
lib. 10. Cap. 5. and. 6.
He says thus. Sacrificium ergo visibile, inuisibilis sacrificij sacramentum,
id est, sacrum signum est. A visible sacrifice therefore (says saint Austen)
is a sacrament that is to say, an holy sign of an invisible sacrifice.

And again he says. Quaecunque igitur in ministerio tabernaculi sieve templis
multis modis leguntur diuinitus esse praecepta: ad dilectionem Dei and proximi
referuntur. In his enim duobis praeceptis, vt scriptum est, tota lex pendet and
Prophetae. All those things therefore, says he, that in the ministry of the
tabernacle or temple, are read to be commanded of God, after many sorts
concerning sacrifices: are referred to signify the love of God and our
neighbor. For in these two commandments, as it is written, the whole law and
Prophets do depend.

And in the same place he says. Proind^, verum sacrificium est, omne opus quod
agitur, vt sancta societate inhaereamus Deo: relatum silicet adidum finem boni,
quo veraciter beati esse possimus. Vnde, and ipsa misericordia qua homini
subuenitur, si propter Deum non fit, non est sacrificium. Wherefore (says
saint Austen) the right sacrifice is, every work that is wrought, to the end
that we may with an holy society cleave unto God: being referred to that end
of goodness, whereby we may be blessed in deed. Wherefore, even that mercy
that is showed in succouring of a man, is no sacrifice, except it be done for
Gods cause.

These words of Saint Austen, do make your definition scarce sufficient, and
the conclusion of your Argument nothing good. By your definition, every such
outward protestation of our inward faith and devotion, as is made in the
Mass, may be a sacrifice: and so every Mass that is said or song by a
Priest, may be a sacrifice. But by saint Austens definition, no Mass that is
not said with relation to that end of goodness, No Mass said for hier, may
be a sacrifice.
whereby we may be happy in deed, is a true sacrifice: Ergo saint Austen and
you conclude not both one thing. Yea by these words of saint Austen it is
plain, that none of those Masses that be said in respect of hire or reward
(as the most part of Masses be) may be accounted for sacrifices.

But grant that all Priests were Angels, and would say their Masses being
moved thereunto by devotion only: yet would not S. Austen allow their Masses
for the sacrifice of the Church. For he says in the aforenamed book. Cap. 5.
Quoniam illud quod ab hominibus appelatur sacrificium, signum est very
sacrificij. That thing that men do call a sacrifice, is the sign of the true
sacrifice. And that he means this of that which you do call the Mass: is
manifest by his words in the later end of the sixth Chapter of that book,
where he says thus. The Church is offered in her own oblation.
Hoc est sacrificium christianorum, multi vnum corpus sumus in Christo: quod
etiam sacramento altaris fidelibus noto, frequent at Ecclesia, vbi ei
demonstratur, quod in ea oblatione quam offert, ipsa offertur. This (says
Saint Austen, speaking of the offering up of our selves a sacrifice to God) is
the sacrifice of the Christians, we being many, are one body in Christ: which
the congregation also does frequent in the sacrament of the Altar, which is
not unknown to the faithful: Where it is plainly showed unto her, that she
her self is in that oblation offered.

The meaning of this manner of speech that saint Austen uses here: was well
known among Christians in his days. But in later times it has grown out of
knowledge, and therefore we had need now to say something of it: least you
and your sort should begin to triumph over us, and say, that now we have
found a sacrament of the altar, which some of us have denied to be. I my self
have denied, and do still deny, that there is any such sacrament of the
altar, as the Popes Church does at this day frequent and use, wherein the
Priest alone does make a sacrifice for the quick and dead: but that there is
such a sacrament of the altar, as saint Austen speaks of here, that is,
wherein Christians do offer up themselves to God, a sacrifice of
thankesgyuing, The Sacrament of the Altar.
and do exercise the works of mercy toward them that stand in need, and
therefore called it in the Greek tongue Eucharistia and Agape, thankesgyuing,
and love: I neither have done, nor do deny.

And because the fathers knew, that this sacrifice could not be acceptable to
God, except it were offered upon Christ, their Altar: they called the
sacrament, whereby they used chiefly to show themselves to be nothing else
but a sacrifice to be offered to God, the sacrament of the altar, meaning by
that altar Christ, whereupon they offered themselves a Sacrifice acceptable
unto God. But such a sacrament as the Papists do hang over their altar, and
such an altar as they use to say Mass upon: we know not of, neither did
the fathers know any such. And this may suffice for the disproofe of your
definition of a sacrifice.

Now something must be said, concerning that place of Cyprian which you cite.
In deed saint Cyprian does in such words as you cite, reprove the gross
opinion of the Capernaits: who supposed that our Savior had spoken of the
outward and fleshly eating of that body of his, which was present in their
sight. And therefore he says, Cum illius personae caro etc. as you have cited.

But here (M. Watson) I must tell you, that you deal not faithfully in cyting
of the words of this father. For in the words next following, he says thus. Sed
in cogitationibus huiusmodi, Cyprian. Sermon. De Caena.
caro and sanguis non prodest quicquam. etc. But in such manner of thoughts
(says Cyprian) flesh and blood do not help any thing at all. For as the
master himself has declared: these words are spirit and life, neither does
the fleshly sense, enter in unto the understanding of so great a deepenesse,
except there come faith thereunto. The bread is meat, the blood is life, the
flesh is substance, the body is the Church. A body, because of the agreeing
of the members in one: bread, because of the congruence of the nourishment.
Blood, because of the working of lyuelynesse. Flesh, because of the property
of the humane nature, that he has taken upon him. Christ does sometime call
this sacrament his own body, sometime his flesh and blood, sometimes bread,
a portion of everlasting life, whereof he has according to these visible
things, given part to the corporal nature. This common food being changed
into flesh and blood, does procure life and increasing unto bodies, and
therefore, the weakness of our faith, being helped by the accustomed effect
of things, is by a sensible argument taught, that the effect of eternal life
is in the visible sacraments, and that we are made one with Christ, not so
much by a bodily passing into him, as by a spiritual.

And again, in the same Sermon, he says. Esus igitur carnis huius, quaedam
auiditas est, and quoddam desiderium manendi in ipso. etc. The eating therefore
of this flesh, is a certain greediness and desire to dwell in him, whereby
we do so press and melt in our selves the sweetness of love: that the taste
of love that is poured into us, may cleave in the roof of our mouth and
bowels, entering into and making moist all the corners, both of our souls and
body. Drinking and eating, do appertain both to one reconing. And as the
bodily substance is nourished by them, and lives and contynueth in health: so
the life of the spirit is nourished with this food, that does properly belong
thereto. And look what food is to the flesh: the same is faith to the soul.
Look what thing meat is to the body: the same is the word to the spirit,
with more excellent power performing everlastingly, the thing that fleshely
nourishments do work temporally and finally. Hitherto Cyprian.

If it had pleased you, to have weighed all these words of Cyprian: I think
you could not for shame, have wrested his former words, to such purpose as you
do, concluding that if we have not Christ's body and blood in the sacrament
for our external sacrifice, whereby we may mitigate. etc. then we should be no
better then Turks. etc.

S. Cyprian himself, does in these words that I have cited out of the same
Sermon: expound his meaning in the former words cyted by you, to be far
other, then that which you gather and conclude upon them.

In deed, if the Capernaits had devoured the body of Christ, and none could
have been saved, but such as had been partakers of the same with them: a very
small number should have been saved by him. And when that number had been dead:
his religion must needs have been at an end, for they should have had no more
sacrifice for sin, for as much as he which should be the alone sacrifice for
sin, had been by them eaten up and consumed.

When saint Cyprian therefore, had thus spoken of the gross opinion of the
Capernaits: he does immediately add these words. Sed in cogitationibus. etc.
But in such manner of cogitations: flesh and blood do profit nothing at all.
For as the master himself has taught: these words are spirit and life.
etc. And again, afterward he says, Esus igitur carnis huius. etc. The eating
of this flesh therefore, is a certain greediness and desire, to abide or
dwell in him. etc.

It is manifest therefore, that saint Cyprian meant not to teach, Cyprians
meaning.
that unless the body of Christ, be really and substantially present in the
sacrament, the Church can have no sacrifice, and so consequently no religion:
but his meaning was to teach, that it was not a fleshely: but a spiritual
eating that he spoke of. And that by faith, ye Church has Christ her
everlasting sacrifice for sin, not offered by the massing Priests every
day: but offered by himself once for all, and yet still present with God as
all things (both past and to come) are. For with God there is neither time
past, nor to come: but all present.

Other sacrifice to mitigate or please God: the Church neither has nor needs
any. For Christ has by that one sacrifice once offered, made perfect as many
as be made holy, that is, Hebr. 10.
as many as be sanctified by the holy spirit of adoption.

And where as you compare us to the Turks, as having no peculier sacrifice to
offer: I must tell you, that you do belie your friend Cluniacensis, Watson
belyeth Cluniacensis.
whose testimony you use to prove the Turks and us to be one sect. His
words be these. Nam cum sint his nostris diebus, quatuor in mundo precipuae
diuersitates sectarum, hoc est chirstianorum, Iudaeorum Saracenorum, and
Paganorum: si Christiani non sacrificant, iam nullus in mundo sacrificat.
Iudaei enim more suo. etc. For where as at this day (says Cluniacensis) there
be in the world four chief diversities of sects: that is, Christians, Jews,
Saracens and Paganes: if the Christians do not sacrifice, there is none in the
world that does sacrifice. For the Jews, according to their manner, beholding
all things with Ox eyes, and like Asses bearing the burdens of Gods law,
without taking any fruit thereof: do sacrifice in no place, because they
say, that Jerusalem alone is the place where God must be honored and
worshipped in sacrifices. etc. And afterward speaking of the Paganes, Petrus
Cluniacensis.
he says. Et cum slendi homines, ignominiosius alijs a Diabolo, his and multis
modis nobis ignotis deludantur: sacrificia tamen, nec Creatori, nec creaturae
exhibent. Sed quod innatus error docuit, absque omnium sacrificiorum notitia
custodiunt. Where as these men, meet to be bywayled, are of the Devil, by
these and many means that we know not deluded more shamefully then other: yet
do they not give any sacrifice, either to the Creator, or to the creature. But
being without the knowledge of all sacrifices: they do observe that thing,
which natural error has taught them.

Here it is manifest, that your Cluniacensis, says not that the Turks only
are without sacrifice: for the Paganes and Turks, are (even by his plain
words) two several sects, and far enough a sunder.

Cluniacensis a corrupter of scripture.
But what though Cluniacensis, and you did agree in all points? Are you of
such credit, that naught that you say may be denied? A more manifest wrester
and corrupter of manifest scriptures, then Cluniacensis was: did never set Pen
to Paper, except you self (M. Watson.)

Coloss. 1.
He is not ashamed to say thus, grounding his words upon Saint Paul to the
Colossians. Vbi est secundum Apostolum, ministerium, quod absconditum fuit a
saeculis. etc. Where is, according to the saying of the Apostle, the ministry
that has been hid since the beginning of generations, and is now opened to
his saints, unto whom God would make known the riches of the glory of this
sacrament among the Gentiles, which sacrament is Christ, the hope of glory?
Where saint Paul has said Mysterium, the mystery or hid secret:
Cluniacensis says Ministerium, ye ministry. And where Paul says Qui est
Christus: Cluniacensis says. Quod est Christus, which sacrament is Christ. For
immediately before he had said Sacramentum, in place of Mysterium: The
sacrament, in place of the mystery. And all this is to make men believe that
saint Paul writing to the Colossians, had taught them, that the sacrament of
Christ's body, is Christ himself.

Much such matter is manifest in your Cluniacensis. I esteem his authority
therefore, even as I esteem youres. And so I do esteem those notable
writers, which at this day do term our Religion by the name of Mahumets
sect. For whatsoever they or you say or write: we are well able to prove that
we hold, the true and catholic faith, which was taught by the Apostles and
Prophets, Jesus Christ being the foundation thereof. With the Prophets we
believe the promise of God concerning the sending of his son in the similitude
of sinful flesh, that in the flesh he might satisfy for the sins of all
his elected and chosen children. And with the Apostles we believe that he is
come, and has by one sacrifice once offered, satisfied for all their sins
that be of that number. And that there remains no more sacrifice for sin.
Hebr. 10.
And that the Church of Christ is bound continually to offer unto God, a
sacrifice of thanks, for this so great and free redemption, by the sacrifice of
his own only begotten son. And that this sacrifice of thanks, is our
obedience in walking in those good works that God has prepared for us to
walk in. This is not to prepare a way for the Turks to ouerunne all, as you
say it is. But this is to be at defiaunce, both with Turk and Pope.

But for the avoiding of these absurdities, WATSON. Division. 11.
and for such causes as I shall God wylling declare hereafter, I presuppose
this foundation of christ's body, to be really present in the blessed
sacrament, to be steadfastly believed of us all, upon the which I build all
that remains now to be said. Which foundation although it has been
undermined of many men and many ways, and therefore requires a full and
perfect treatise to be made of it alone: yet as I intend not to occupy all
this time in that, so I may not well so slenderly leave it, that has been so
much and often assaulted, but shall declare the sum of that moves me to
continue still in that truth I was borne in, to keep still that faith I was
baptized in and put on Christ, which faith seeing it is universal, if I should
leave it, I should forsake Christ, and be an heretic, not following that form
of doctrine I received of my fathers, and they of theirs from the beginning,
but chosing my self a new way and new masters that please me, being so
condemned by mine own conscience and judgment, which is the very property
and definition of an heretic.

CROWLEY.
The obsurdities ye speak of, we have something touched already. The other
causes that move you, we mind by Gods help to say somewhat to, when you shall
declare them. But in the mean while, let us see the sum of that which moves
you to continue still in that faith you were baptized in. etc.

WATSON. Division. 12.
There be three things that hold me in this faith: the manifest and plain
scripture, the uniform aucthorities of holy men, and the consent of the
universal Church. These three be the arguments, that a christen man may stick
unto, and never be deceived, specially if they be knit and joined together,
concerning one matter but if they be separate, then some of them be but weak
staffes to lean unto. As for example the scripture without the consent of the
church is a weapon as meet for an heretic, as for a catholic, for Arius,
Nestorius, and such other Heretics did allege the scripture for their
opinions, as the catholics did, but their alleging was but the abusing of the
letter, which is indifferent to good and evil, and deprauing of the true
sense, which is only known by the tradition and consent of the catholic
church: so that the one without the other is not a direction, but a seduction
to a simple man, because the very scripture in deed, is not the bare letter,
as it lies to be taken of every man, but the true sense, as it is delivered by
the universal consent of christ's church.

Likewise the writings and sayings of the fathers, if they be but the mind of
one man without the consent of other, were he never so well learned and
virtuous, otherwise yet his wrytings I say in that point be not a confirmation
for an ignorant man to hold him in the truth, but a temptation to seduce him,
and pull him from the truth.

The consent of the Church is always a sure staff, the very pillar of truth,
whether it be in things expressed in the letter of the scripture, or in things
delivered unto us by tradition of the Apostles. He that holds him by this
staff can not fall in faith, but stand in truth.

The three staves that you say you lean unto, CROWLEY.
are very good stays, and such as a man may be bold to trust unto, and
especially (as you have well said) when they be knit and joined together,
concerning one matter. But if they be severed: then some of them be but weak
staves to lean unto. Hitherto you have said very well. But when amongst these
three staves, you make the consent of ye Church only to be the sure staff,
and the scriptures and sayings of learned and godly fathers, without the
consent of the Church, to be but a seduction or tentation to seduce the simple
and ignorant man: me thinks you show your self to beastly blind. Where
was this sure staff of yours, when all the Apostles were so far from the
hope of the resurrection of their master: that they could not believe the
report of them that had seen him after he was risen again? Marc. 16.
Had this consent of theirs in unbelief been a sure stay, for men to lean
unto? And was the prophecy of David, at that time a seduction or tentation,
Psalm. 16. Act. 2.
to seduce a simple ignorant man, because it was not joined with the consent
of the Church? Did Christ go about to seduce the Jews: when he bad them
search the scriptures? John. 5.
When all the Apostles had consented, that none should go in unto the heathen,
to preach the Gospel unto them, Act. 11.
and Christ had said, go and teach all Nations: where was then the sure
staff to lean to? What staff was it, that the worshipful of Berrhaea leaned
unto, when they had heard Paul preach there? Act. 17.
Was it the consent of the Church? No, saint Luke says, Scrutabantur
scripturas. They searched the scriptures. That was then the sure staff to
lean to.

Saint Austen would have no credit, further then his words might be
confirmed, De Trinitat. libr. 3.
by Scripture and sound reason. His words are these. Noli meis literis quasi
scripturis canonicis inseruire, sed in illis and quod non credebas eum
inueneris incunctanter creed: in istis autem quod certum non habebas, nisi
certum intellexeris, noli firmiter credere. Be thou not bound to my wrytings,
as to the canonical scriptures: but in the scriptures, believe without fear,
whatsoever thou shall find therein, which thou did not believe before: But in
my wrytings, do not firmly believe, that which thou wast not sure of before:
unless thou may certainly understand it. Do not correct my wrytings by
thine own opinion or contention: but by that thou read in holy Scripture,
or unshaken reason. etc.

Contr. Petiliani. Epist. Cap. 12.
Again, the same Austen says. Nemo mihi dicat, O quid dixit Donatus? Aut quid
dixit Parmenianus? aut Pontius? aut quilibet illorum. Quia, ne Catholicis
Episcopis consentiendum est, sicubi sort falluntur, vt contra canonicas
scripturas aliquid sentiant. Let no man say unto me, Oh, what has Donatus
said? Or, what has Parmenian said? Or Pontius? Or any of those men: For we
may not consent to the Catholic Bishops, if they be at any time deceived, so
that they hold any thing contrary to the canonical Scriptures. Here it is
manifest, that saint Austen supposed the scriptures to be the sure staff that
we should stay upon. And the consent of the Bishops or other learned men, to be
but a weak stay, and such as no man may trust to, when it is severed from the
other: contrary to the opinion that you hold (M. Watson.) And yet more
plainly the same saint Augustine says in an other place. Cedamus igitur, and
consentiamus autoritati scripturae sanctae: Libr. De Peccat. merit. and
Remissi. Cap. 22.
quae nescit falli, nec fallere. Let us therefore consent to the aucthority of
the holy scripture: which can neither be deceived nor deceive.

Gerson also says thus. Dicto autoris, autoritate, canonica munito: plus quam
declarationi Papae credendum est. We must give more credit to the saying of an
Author, Gerson against master Watson.
yt is confirmed with the authority of the canonical scripture: then to the
declaration of the Pope himself. And again he says. In sacris litteris
excellenter erudito, atque autoritatem catholicam proferenti: plus est
credendum quam generali concilio. More credit is to be given to a man that is
excellenly learned in the holy scriptures, and brings forth a catholic
authority: then to the general counsel.

All this considered, I think it better to lean to the staff of the
scripture, with Austen, Gerson, and other ancient fathers: then with you and
such as you are, to trust to that broken staff, that may and often times has
deceived, such as have stayed themselves thereon.

I do reverence the wrytings and sayings of Fathers, Chrysostom. in Galat. 1.
so do I the consent of the Church: but the word of God above both: and
neither of both, without it. For as Chrysostom says, Paulus vero, etiam
Angelis e coelo descendentibus, praeponit scripturas: idque valde congruenter.
Siquidem Angeli, quamlibit magni: tamen serui sunt ac ministri. Caeteru^ omnes
scripturae, non a seruis, sed ab vniuersorum Domino Deo veneru^t ad nos. Paul
does prefer the scriptures before the Angels that come down from heaven:
and that very orderly? For although the Angels be great: yet are they
servant and ministers. But all the scriptures are commen unto us: from him
that is Lord and God of all creatures.

I allow therefore, all your three staves, and I like them all well, so long
as they be fast tied together. But if you do once pluck them in sunder, then I
am well pleased, that you take to your self the two latter, and leave me the
first to stay upon.

Now concerning this matter of the presence: WATSON. Division. 13.
I am able by Gods help to show all these three things, joined and knit
together so, that we can not be deceived in this point, except we will deceive
our selves as many wilfully do.

The scripture by plain and manifest words, against the which hell gates shall
never prevail, does testify and confirm our faith in many places, but
specially in the words of our savior Christ himself in his last supper,
saying to his Disciples: Math. 26.
Take, eat this is my body, which is given for you. This is my blood of the
new Testament, which is shed for many, and for you in remission of sins:
which most plain scriptures many have gone about to delude, and to reduce them
to a base understanding by figurative speeches, contending these words. This is
my body. This is my blood to be spoken figuratively, and not as the words
purport: because other like sayings in the scripture be taken figuratively, as
these: I am the way, I am the door. The stone is Christ and such other,
wherein they have declared their deuilishe and detestable sophistry to their
own damnation and the subversion of a great many other.

They profess themselves to be learned men, but who heard ever tell of any
such kind of learning, as to prove one singular by an other, as if one should
reason thus: Thomas is an honest man, ergo John is an honest man: The Swan is
white, ergo the Crow is white.

Which arguments be like this: I am the way, is a figurative speech, ergo
likewise. This is my body, is a figurative speech. With such fond folies and
sophismes is the truth assaulted against all good learning, and the rules of
all true reasoning. God open their eyes to see, and follow his heavenly
wisdom.

CROWLEY.
For the matter of the presence of Christ in the sacrament: you have manifest
Scripture, as you say, this is my body, this is my blood. etc. Which
Scriptures some have gone about to delude with fond follies and sophismes,
such as it pleases your self to frame. I am sure you did never read in any
of their writings that you speak of, any argument so framed as you have set
forth in your Sermon. We do know that one mere particular cannot be proved by
another. And therefore we use not to conclude, as you would make your Auditorie
believe that we do. We say that the scripture has many such speeches, as this
is my body, and this is my blood, which are not proper speeches, but
figurative: wherefore it is not of necessity required, that this is my body,
and this is my blood, should be taken for proper speeches. The circumstances
must give the understanding.
But if the circumstaunces be such, that by them, the speech can not be
proper, but figurative: then is there no cause why, we may not understand
these places by the figure, as well as the other. I will therefore consider
your circumstaunces, and then shape you a further answer.

But if we will consider the circumstaunces of the text, WATSON. Division. 14
who was the speaker, for what intent, what time, and such other: it shall
plainly appear that the literal sense, as the words purport, is the true
sense, that the holy Ghost did principally intend. As for example. First it
appears evidently, the speaker to be Jesus Christ our Lord, Gods son equal
and omnipotent God with the father, and that these his words be not words of
a bare narration and teaching, but words whereby a sacrament is instituted.
And for that reason we must consider that it is otherwise with Christ, then
with us, for in man the word is true, when the thing is true, whereof it is
spoken: In God the thing is true when the word is spoken of the thing. Man's
word declares the thing to be as it is before, Gods word makes the thing to
be, as it was not before.

In man the truth of his word depends of the truth of the thing. Contrary
in God the truth of the thing depends upon the speaking of the word, as the
psalm says: Ipse dixit and facta sunt. He spoke the word, Psalm. 148.
and the things were made. And this thing the Devil knew well enough, being
sure that if Jesus were Christ and God, he could with his word both create
new things, and also change the nature and substance of any thing: Math. 4.
and therefore said unto him tempting him, whether he was Gods son or no: if
thou be Gods son speak the word, that these stones may be made bread.
Whereby we may learn that although in man's speech it is not true to say,
these stones be bread: yet if God should say so, it should be true the inferior
nature of creatures gyuing place to the omnipotent power of God the Creator.

After which sort Ireneus reasons against those heretics, that denied Jesus
Christ to be Gods son, using that most constantly believed truth of the
sacrament, that we hold now grounded upon Christ's words, for an argument to
convince Jesus the speaker to be Gods son. His words be these. Quomodo autem
constabit eis eum panem in quo gratiae actae sunt corpus esse domini sui, Libr.
4. ca. 34.
and calicem sanguinis eius si non ipsum fabricatoris mundi filium dicant? How
shall it be certain unto them, that that bread upon which thanks are given
(that is to say the Eucharisticall bread) is the body of their Lord, and the
Cup of his blood, if they say not that he is the son of him that made the
world? as though he should reason thus: These words which Jesus spoke of the
blessed bread, saying: This is my body. This is the Cup of my blood, be either
true or false. If the speaker of them be pure man and not God as they say,
then can they not be true: for man's word changes not the nature of things,
as it is here. But if the words be true, as they certainly believe, then the
speaker of them must needs be Gods son, of infinite power, able to make the
things to be as he says they be. And also in his.57. Ireneus lib. 4. Cap. 57.
Chapter the same fourth book, he makes the like argument in these words.
Quomodo just Dominus si alterius patris existit huius conditionis quae est
secundum nos, accipiens panem suum corpus confitebatur, and temperamentu^
calicis, sui sanguinem confirmauit. If our Lord be a pure man, that nature and
condition that we be of, the son of an other father then God: How did he
justly and truly taking bread into his hand, confess and say it to be his
body, and confirm that mixture of wine and water, that was in the Chalice, to
be his own blood?

By these two places of Ireneus that lived within.150. years of Christ, we are
taught not to fly to our figures of Grammar to make these words of Christ
true, which indeed we must needs do, or else say they be false, if Christ
the speaker be but only man and not God, but we be taught by him to believe
them to be most true, and for that reason to believe also, that Christ the
speaker is Gods son, by whose almighty power the things be changed and made
as he speaks so that we may justly, after the mind of Ireneus and diverse
other old Authors, which were long to rehearse now, conceive this opinion of
these men, that say these words of Christ cannot be true, except they be
understood by a figurative speech: that they either believe not themselves
that Christ is Gods son, or else give occasion to other to revive that old
damnable Heresey of Arius that denied Christ's Godhead, the experience whereof
we have had of late days, of some that from Sacrame^taries by necessary
consequence of that Heresey, became Arianes.

The first circumstaunce that you consider: CROWLEY.
is the speaker of these words. I am contented to begin with the same. And
also to agree with you upon the equality of Christ with his heavenly father in
all points, touching his divine nature: wherefore, if you conceive such an
opinion of me as you speak of, because I say that these words. This is my
body, is a figurative speech: you conceive a wrong opinion. And I am sure, I
may safely say as much, for all those that you speak of.

But now let us see, how honestly you have behaved your self: in applying
the words of Ireneus to your purpose. Libr. 4. ca. 34.
He says thus. Quomodo autem constabit etc. First I must tell you, that even
as in the place that you did before cite out of Ireneus, you picked out a piece
for your purpose, and left that which might make the Writers meaning plain: so
you have done here also. For in the same Chapter, not twenty lines before
those words that you cite: Ireneus says thus. Igitur, non sacrificiae
sanctificant hominem, non enim indiget sacrificio Deus: sed conscientiae eius
qui offert sanctificat sacrificium, pura existens, and praestat acceptare Deum,
quasi ab amico. The sacrifices do not make the man that does offer them, holy
(for God has no need of Sacrifice) but the conscience of him that offers,
being pure: does make the sacrifice holy, and causes God to take it in good
part, as at the hand of a friend.

And again he says. Oportet enim nos oblationem Deo facere. etc. We must
needs make an oblation to God: and be found thankful to God our maker in all
things. In pure judgment, in faith without Hypocrisy, in firm hope, in
fervent love, offering up the first fruits of those things which are his
creatures. And the Church only may offer this pure oblation to her maker,
offering unto him, some part of his creature, with thankesgyuing unto him. But
the Jews do not now offer, for their hands be full of blood: for they have
not received the word, whereby offering is made to God. No more do all the
Synagogs of heretics. And other which say that there is another father,
besides him that is the maker: do therefore when they offer to him, those
things that be of the same creation that we are: declare thereby, that he is
desirous of that which is not his own, and coueteth after those things that
appertain to other. And such as do say, that the things which are of the
same creation with us, be made by defect and ignorance and suffering: do when
they offer the fruits of ignorance and of suffering and defect, sin against
their father, reuiling him rather then giving him thanks.

After these words, do those words follow that you have cited for your
purpose. Quomodo autem constabit eis. etc. How shall it be certain unto them,
that, that bread, wherein thanks are given, is the body of their Lord, and
the Cup of his blood, if they say not that he is the son of him that is the
maker of the world? Thus far go the words that you cite. And where as you
shut up the matter with an interrogation, as though there were the whole of
that which the Author does there write of this matter: in as many Copies as I
have seen, the point there is but a comma, and the sentence continued with
these words, id est, verbum eius, per quod lignum fructificat. etc. That is,
his words, whereby the tree is made fruitful, and the Fountaynes to flow,
that gives first the blade, then the ear, and then the full corn in the
ear? And again, how do they say that the flesh which is nourished with the
body and blood of the Lord, does come into corruption, and not receive life?
Therefore either let them change their mind, or abstain from offering the
things that are spoken of before. As for our judgment, it is agreeable to the
Euchariste or thankesgyuing: and on the contrary part, the Euchariste, does
confirm our sentence or judgment. For we do offer unto him the things that
are his, and do agreeably preach the communion and unity of the flesh and
the spirit. For even as the bread which is of the earth, taking the name of
God, is not now common bread, but the Eucharist (or sacrament of
thankesgyuing) consisting of two things, one earthly and another heavenly: so
our bodies also, being made partakers of the Euchariste, are not now
corruptible, for as much as they have the hope of the resurrection. etc.

And again in the end of the Chapter he says. Sic and idio nos quoque
offerre vult munus ad altar frequenter sine intermissione. Est ergo altar in
caelis. etc. His will is also, that in such sort and therefore, we should
oftentimes and contynually offer a gift at the altar: The altar therefore is
in heaven. For thither are all our prayers and oblations directed: and our
temple, even as John says in his revelations: And the Temple of God and
tabernacle was set open.

If you had weighed all these words of Ireneus together, Watson did not weight
Ireneus words.
being written in the same Chapter with those that you cite in your Sermon: I
suppose you would not have thought his words so meet for your purpose. The
sacrifice (says he) is sanctified by the pure conscience of the offerer. We
must be found thankful to our maker in all things: in pure judgment, in
unfeigned faith, in steadfast hope, and in fervent love, offering to him the first
fruits of those things that be his creatures. And the Church only may offer
this oblation. The bread which is of the earth receiving the name of God, is
not now common bread: but the Eucharist, consisting of two things the one
earthly, and the other heavenly. He will have us to offer a gift upon the
altar continually without ceasing. The altar therefore is in heaven.

How do these words agree with the real presence of Christ in the sacrament?
And how can these words suffer your Mass to be accounted the sacrifice of
the Church? The whole purpose of Ireneus in that Chapter, is to show, that
the works of love proceeding from an unfeigned faith, and a pure conscience:
are that sacrifice that God regards. And in the use of the sacrament which he
calls the Eucharist or thanksgiving: this sacrifice so acceptable to God, is
not only taught by sensible signs, but also exercised. And the altar whereon
this sacrifice is offered, is Christ, which is in heaven.

Against whom Ireneus did write.
The words that you cite, were by Ireneus spoken against such as affirmed that
God is not the maker of those creatures that we have the use of. Which
affirmation if it were true: then Christ being the son of God (whom those
men denied to be the maker of the world) had no power, to institute the
sacrament of his body and blood in any of those creatures: for he should not
then have been Lord over them.

As touching the names, body and blood given to this sacrament, the reason
thereof his declared before. Your reasons therefore that you make in Ireneus
name, are not worth a Lowse.

To the same end tends the other place, which you cite out of the.57.
Chapter of the same book. Wherefore, those two places of Ireneus, who lived
within.150. years after Christ, do teach you to use the figure called
Metaphora or translation, in the understanding of these words. This is my
body, and this is my blood: notwithstanding that Christ the speaker is both God
and man, Psalm. 148.
and even he of whom David spoke, when he said Ipse dixit and facta sunt. He
spoke the word and the things were made. For he spoke not those words as one
that would by them creat a new, or alter and change the substance of that
which he had before created: Christ's purpose in speaking ye words of his last
supper.
but his purpose was to institute a sacrament or visible sign of the exceeding
great mercy that he should shortly show, in giving his body and blood, for
the redemption of the sins of the world, and of that wonderful mystery of
joining the faithful together into the fellowship of members of one body, and
of the same to him their head. These words of Christ therefore are true in his
meaning, notwithstanding ought that you can say: and yet to be understood by
the figure, and not as the words do purport. And yet are we that say so:
far enough from the Arians heresy.

The second circumstance I spoke of, WATSON. Division. 15.
was to consider to what purpose and intent Christ spoke those words, and I
said they were words not of a bare narration, teaching some doctrine, but the
words of the institution of a sacrament of the new Testament. And then it
follows, that if they be the form of a sacrament as they be in deed: then
must they needs be that instrument whereby Gods almighty power assisting the
due ministration of his Priest, works that grace inwardly, that the words
purport outwardly. For so it is in all other sacraments. In Baptism, these
words. Ego Baptizo te, I baptize thee, and so forth, like as outwardly to the
ears, of the hearer they signify a washing, so almighty God assisting the
due pronouncing of them, does inwardly work the grace of washing the soul of
him, to whom the words be spoken, if their be no stop or impediment of his
party.

And likewise in penance as the words of the Priest saying: Ego absoluo te ab
omnibus peccatis tuis in nomine Patris, and filij, and spiritus sancti. I
absolve thee from al thy sins in the name of the father, and the son, and
the holy Ghost, do signify forgiveness, so God does inwardly forgive, if the
party be truly penitent.

Likewise in marriage that knot the man knitteth with the woman in taking her
to his wife, and she him to her husband, God also inwardly does knit the same,
which man can not loose: and so forth of all other sacraments.

Now to our purpose: The grace which is included in these words, this is my
body, this is my blood, is not only accidental grace as in the other, but the
body of Christ to be our sacrament, which is the substance of grace, the
Author, Bernar. Sermon De Coena.
Fountain, and Well of all grace, as S. Bernard says. Dicitur Eucharistia per
excellentia^. In hoc enim Sacrame^to non solum quaelibet gratia, sed ille a quo
est omnis gratia sumitur. This sacrament is called Eucharistia, for some
excellency above all other, for in this sacrament is received not only any
other grace, but he of whom proceeds all grace.

Then it follows, that where as the grace of this sacrament, which the words
purport to the outward ears of all men, is the essential grace of Christ's
body and blood to be there present, it follows, I say that Christ by these
words, as by a convenient instrument, works inwardly, in that he gave to his
Disciples the real presence of his own body and blood, Emesenus. Oratione De
corp. and sanguine Christi.
as Eusebius Emesenus says: Fide aestimandi non specie, nec exterioris
censenda est visu, sed interioris hominis affectu. To be esteemed by faith, and
not by the outward form, and not to be judged by the sight of the outward
man, but by the affection of the inward man.

CROWLEY.
First you considered the person of him that spoke these words, This is my body:
and now you consider his intent in speaking. His purpose was not (say you) by
these words to show what the thing was that he spoke of: but to use the words
as an instrument whereby the inward thing signified by the outward words is
wrought. And to make this your opinion plain: you use the words in Baptism,
in Penance, and the contract in marriage, for examples.

Surely (M. Watson) this must needs appear a strange manner of doctrine, when
it shall be waighed by them that do consider what the use of words is, and
what the almighty power of God is. Learned men have always taught, that the
use of words is to teach the hearers: and that they be instruments serving
only to that use. None but Sorcerers will say that words are instruments to
work wonders with. In deed, the Poet speaking of magical verses, says
thus. Carmina vel caelo, possunt deducere lunam. Verses are of such force that
they are able to bring the Moon down from heaven. But we find not in the
holy scripture, or in any Catholic Writer, that words have any other use,
then to teach.

Peradventure you will say, that the Prophet David will take your part,
because he says. Verbo Domini caeli firmati sunt: Psalm. 33.
and spiritu oris eius omnis exercitus eorum. By the word of the Lord were
the heavens established, and all the army thereof by the breath of his mouth.
But saint Austen, and as many as I have seen, yt do write upon that Psalm,
do with one voice affirm, that the Prophet does not there mean of such a
formed word as you do here, neither of the breath that issues out at the
mouth in the uttering of such words: but of the son of God and the holy
Ghost. So that his words are this much to say. In the son and the holy
Ghost: has the Lord, which is but one divine power, established the heavens.
etc.

The power of God is such, that at his word, beck, or twinkling of his eye:
he is able to do what he will do. According to the words of the same prophet
in another Psalm. Deus noster in caelo, omnia quaecunque voluit fecit in caelo
and in terra. Our God is in heaven, Psalm. 114.
look what he would do, that has he done, both in heaven and in earth.

I conclude therefore, that it is the power of God, that works all in all.
And that the word formed is no instrument to work by, otherwise then in
teaching. And therefore, your examples be evil fauouredly applied.

As for your Bernarde and your Emisenus, I need not much to esteem, since (as
it may seem) they be Doctors of your own making: and therefore I can not
blame them, though they speak as you would have them speak. But it should
have been much more for your honesty, being father of ye act when they
proceeded: to have instructed them so before hand, that they might have been
able to speak congrue latin. I know not by what rule of Grammar, this can be
justified to be congrue latin. Fide estimandi non specie, nec exterioris
hominis censenda est visu. etc. Neither do I know by what figure it may be
excused.

But though your Emisenus had written as good latin as ever did Cicero: yet
could I not much regard his judgment, for that I find that he was Signifer
arianae factionis, Chronico. Hieronymi.
the standard bearer of the Arian faction. Or if you have any other Emisenus to
show: I suppose he will be found (when you shall show him) such one as
Bishop Jewel proves Master Hardyngs Amphilochius to be.

Your Bernardus also: must be such another. For that Bernardus that was
Claraeuallensis Abbas, was of another mind as it appears in his Sermon In
caena Domini. His words be these. Vt enim de vsualibus sumamus exemplum: datur
anulus absolute propter anulum, and nulla est significatio: datur ad
inuestiendum de haereditate aliqua, and signum est: ita vt iam dicere possit
qui accipit: Anulus non valet quicquam, sed haereditas est quam quaerebam. In
hunc itaque modum appropinquans passioni Dominus, de gratia sua inuestire
curauit suos, vt i^usibilis gratia, signo aliquo visibili praestaretur. Ad haec
instituta sunt omnia sacramenta, ad haec Eucharistiae participatio etc. That we
may take an example from among those things that be usual: a King is delivered
as a King without condition, and it has no signification. And the same is
given to inuest in some enheritaunce, and so it is a sign: so that the party
that receives it, may now say: The King, is a thing of no value: but the
inheritance is the thing that I sought. After this sort the Lord therefore
drawing near unto his passion, did of his own free mercy, provide to inuest
those that appartayned unto him, that the invisible grace, might by some
visible sign be set forth and showed. For this purpose were all sacraments
instituted. The participation of the Eucharist, was instituted for this
purpose, and so was the washing of feet. To conclude, Baptism, which is the
beginning of all sacraments, was instituted for this purpose, wherein we are
planted together to the similitude or likeness of his death: wherefore, the
three sold dipping, does bear the figure of the three days space that must
now be celebrated.

This matter is far disagreeing to that which you cite out of your Bernarde.
Watson has a Bernard of his own.
I conclude therefore that your Bernarde, is not the right Bernarde: but a
counterfeit of your own making. Such a one as your Emisenus is. And therefore
his Sermons are printed by themselves with this note before them: Proculdubio,
non a nostro Bernardo editi fuerunt. Without doubt, they were never of our
Bernards setting out.

Thirdly, we may consider, that these words, WATSON. Division. 16
be the performaunce of a former promise, where Christ (as it is written in the
sixth Chapter of S. John) promised to give us the same flesh to eat, that he
would give to the death, for the life of the world saying. Panis quem ego
dabo, caro mea est, John. 6.
quam ego dabo pro mundi vita. The bread which I shall give unto you, is my
flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.

Which promise, we never read, that Christ (which is the very truth and can not
lie) did ever at any time perform, but in his last supper, when he gave his
body and blood to his Disciples: and to promise his flesh, and to give bare
bread and not his flesh, is no performing, but a breaking of his promise, and
a deluding of them to whom he made the promise. For as for the interpretation,
which some men make of Christ's words, that he will give his flesh to us to be
eaten spiritually by faith: is but a vain and fained gloss for that text.

And although Christ do so give it to be eaten by faith: yet we may not
exclude one truth by another truth as Sophisters do. For Christ gave his
flesh to us to be eaten spiritually by faith, ever from the beginning of the
world, and also at that present, when he spoke those words, so that it were a
very vain thing for Christ, to promise to give a thing which he ever before,
and also at that present, and ever after contynually does give.

But it was never so taken of any good ancient aucthor which all with one
consent do expound this text of saint John, of the giving of his flesh in
his last supper under the form of bread, and therefore Cirillus writes,
Cirillus in John. li. 4. Capit. 14.
that our savior Christ did not expound and make plain the manner of the
mystery, and the performaunce of this his promise, to them that asked the
unfaithful question, How, without faith, but to his Disciples that believed
him and asked no such question of him, he declared the manner of it in his last
supper.

Wherefore we may well conclude upon this circumstaunce that Christ's flesh is
verily present in the sacrament to be given unto us, because he promised
before, that he would give us the same flesh for our food, that he would give
on the cross for our redemption.

CROWLEY.
The third circumstaunce (you say) that you consider, is a promise that our
Savior made when he said, the bread that I shall give is my flesh. etc. If I
did not know your blindness, and shamelessness, in fathering upon the
ancient Writers, such matter as they never meant to utter in their wrytings: I
could not wonder enough at your beastly boldness, which drives you to say,
that all the good ancient Writers do with one consent, expound the words of
saint John as you do.

But after this great boast, you give us a taste of your small roste (as the
common saying is) and you make Cyrillus to speak after your fantasy, in this
sort. Our Savior Christ did not expound. etc. But that the reader may see,
how faithfully you deal with Cyrillus in this point: I will let him see the
words as they be written in the place that you note in the margent. His words
be these.

Misericors certe and mitis Christus est: vt a rebus ipsis videre licet. Non
enim aspere ad crudelitatem eorum respondit, nec vllo modo contendit: sed
viuificantem huius mysterij cognitionem, iterum atque iterum, in mentibus eorum
imprimere studebat. Et quomodo quidem carnem suam dabit ad manducandum non
docet: quia intelligere illi non potuerunt. Quam magna vero bona, si cum fide
manducabunt adipiscentur, id iterum atque iterum aperit, vt aeternae desyderio
vitae, ad fidem compellantur, per quam etiaem, doceri facilius poterint. Esaias.
7.
Sic enim Esaiaes dixit. Si enim inquit, non credideritis: nec intelligetis.
Oportebat igitur fidei primum radices in amimo iacere: deinde illa quaerere,
quae homini quaerenda sunt. Illi vero antequam crederent, importune quaerebant.
Hac igitur de causa Dominus, quomodo id fieri possit, non enodauit, sed fide id
quaerendum hortatur: sic credentibus discipulis, fragmenta panis dedit, dicens.
Accipite and manducate, hoc est corpus meum. Calicem etiam similiter
circumtulit dicens. Bibite ex hoc omnes, hic est Calix sanguinis mei, qui pro
multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum. Perspicis, quia sine fide
quaerentibus mysterij modum nequaquam explanauit: credentibus autem, etiam non
quaerentibus exposuit. Undoubtedly (says Cyrill) Christ is merciful and
mylde: as a man may perceive even by the very things themselves. For he did
not shape a sharp answer to their cruelty, neither does he by any means
contend: but he does endeavor more then once, to print in their minds the
quickening knowledge of this mystery. But after what manner, he will give his
own flesh to be eaten, he does not declare: because they could not
understand it. But how great good things they shall obtain, if they shall
with faith eat it: he does oftentimes declare, that by the desire of eternal
life, they might be compelled to embrace faith, by the mean whereof, they might
the more easily be taught. For thus has Esaias said. If ye will not believe: ye
shall not understand. It behooved therefore, first to cast the roots of faith
in the mind: and afterward to seek those things that man should seek. But
those men did before they believed, out of season seek for those things. For
this cause therefore, the Lord did not declare, how that thing might be done:
but he does encourage them to seek it by faith. In like manner unto his
Disciples which believed: he gave the pieces of bread saying, take and eat,
this is my body. The cup also he did in like manner bear about saying: drink
ye all of this, this is the Cup of my blood, which shall be shed for many, for
the remission of sins. Thou see that he opened not the manner of the
mystery, to them that sought it without faith: but to such as believed, he did
expound it, before they asked any question.

Now let the indifferent Reader judge how faithfully you have handled the
words of Cyrill, and so he may have the less cause to credit you in your
large affirmation, wherein you say, Watsons store is but small.
that all the good ancient Writers do with one consent, expound this place of
John as you do. Whereas, when your store shall be sought: there shall not one
that lived within.600. years after Christ, be found of your mind in this
point.

Wherefore, we may well conclude, that Christ's flesh is not in the sacrament
in such sort as ye teach: and that Christ meant not by those words that you
cite out of John, to promise, that he would give his body in such sort to be
eaten, as ye have affirmed that he did. But that he meant to teach, that he
himself is that heavenly food that the father gives for the life of the
world, The meaning of Christ in the 6. of John.
and that he would give them none other food from heaven but only that which
at the time appointed, he would yield up for the life of the world. And that
not to be eaten after a fleshly sort, but after such a spiritual sort, as the
fathers that lived before he was incarnated, had and did eat it. Your
exposition of saint John's words therefore, is but a vain and feigned gloss
for that text.

WATSON. Division. 17
The time also is to be considered, that he spoke these words the night before
he suffered death, at which time, and the next day after, he ended and
fulfilled al figures, saying on the cross, Consummatum est. All figures and
shadows be ended and expired, which was no time then, to institute and begin
new figures. Is it lykely or probable, that our savior Christ then entering
into his Agony, and beginning his passion, accustoming commonly before to teach
his Disciples in plain words, without Parables or figurative speeches: would
then so lightly behave himself, as to delude his chosen and entirely beloved
Disciples, in calling those things his body that is given for them, and his
blood that is shed for them, which were neither his body nor his blood, but
bare bread and wine? Or is there any religion in our christen faith, in
nicknaming things, or calling them otherwise, then they be?

If any man think himself able to answer that, because Christ said he was
a Vine, he was a door, being neither Vine nor door: that man seems to me not
substantially to way the words and speeches of scripture.

For let him consider thorowout all the scripture whersoeuer he shall find,
that Christ, spoke any thing of himself by words of our common speech (for
the God head and the properties of the Godhead be ineffable, and cannot be
expressed to our capacity, but by words and names of wordly and natural
things here among us.) He shall always find that Christ was a better and more
singular thing then the word did properly signify, that was attribute unto
him, and to make this matter more plain by examples.

Where Christ said, I am the way, he meant not, that he was the way that
leads to the City, or to some other place but that he was a more excellent
way. A way that leads to the father, to heaven, to everlasting life.

When he said, he was the door, he meant not, John. 10.
that he was the door of the sheepefold here in earth, but a far better door,
the door of the Church, the spiritual sheepefold, by the which door whosoever
enters, shall be saved.

Also calling himself a Vine, John. 15.
he meant that he was the spiritual Vine, whereof all christen men be
branches, and better then such a Vine as grows in the fields.

And likewise by that he calls himself the light, we understand, that he was
not the sensible light of this world but the heavenly light that neither by
course is changed, nor by shadow is darkened.

So that it may be observed for a rule, when Christ does attribute the name of
any sensible creature to himself, ever the understanding exceeds and
excels the word in dignity.

And if this be true in all kind of teaching and doctrine shall we now in the
high mysteries and sacraments of God come from the Hall to the Kitchen, from
the better to the worst? that where Christ says. This is my body, we shall
understand it is bread a worse thing, then his body. This is my blood, that is
to say, wine a worse thing then his blood. This be fond and false gloses,
neither true, nor lykely, nor yet tolerable.

Wherefore leaving out a great many other circumstaunces, that would serve very
well, Math. 26.
to set forth the truth of this doctrine, I shall conclude thus, seeing saint
Mathewe says in plain terms, it is my body, it is my blood: Saint Mark
says it is my body: Mar. 14. Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 11. John. 9.
Saint Luke says it is my body: Saint Paul says it is my body: Saint John
says it is my flesh, shall we now fiftene hundredth year after them, handle
the matter so finely, and way the scripture so substantially, that we shall
affirm the contradictory to be the true sense, saying this is not my body,
this is not my blood, but a figure and a sign of my body and blood? These
evident scriptures move me to continue still steadfast in that faith I was borne
in, and not to be moved with vain words and reasons without probability,
against all rule and form of true reasoning.

CROWLEY.
I would not have thought, that any man could have been able by Arguments to
have persuaded you to grant so much, as you have here granted, of your own
voluntary and willing accord. Watsons voluntary grant.
That is, that all figures and shadows are ended and expired, and that it was
no time for Christ, at that time to institute new figures. I trust you will
now be an enemy to all those figures and shadows, that the Pope has brought
into ye Church of Christ. But me thinks I hear you say, that you mean only
to affirm that the time wherein Christ spoke these words, this is my body, was
the time not meet, for the institution of figures and shadows. Well. If we
shall have occasion hereafter, to charge you with these words: we will urge
them with such force, that so slender an answer shall not serve you.

But in the mean while you dalley with those figurative speeches that are used
in the scriptures. I am the way, I am the door, I am the Vine, I am the light.
A general rule may be (say you) observed: that when Christ speaks of
himself by the name of any creature, there must be a better thing
understand, then the thing is, that such a name does properly signify. And
therefore we must in the matter of the sacrament, understand a better and more
excellent thing, then is Bread and Wine.

Me thinks (M. Watson) you might have spared all this labor. For none of us
has or does deny, that when Christ speaks of himself, and gives himself
the name of any creature: we must understand a better thing, then is properly
signified by that name. But what makes this for your purpose? It seems to
me, that either you your self have forgotten your Logic: or else when you did
set forth your Sermon in print, you thought that the world would never turn
so, that any Logition might be bold in open writing to control your subtle
sophistry.

When I was Logitioner in Oxford: I learned, that in every Cathegoricall
proposition, there be Tres termini. Subiectum, praedicatum, and Copula. Now
the Subiectum, is that, whereof affirmation or negation is made: and Predicatum
is that, which is affirmed or denied. And Copula is the verb Substantive, that
in construction stands betwixt them.

You must not be offended with me, Watsons sophistry has made him forget his
Logic.
for that I talk with you of things so far under the profession of a Doctor
of Divinity: for surely you seem to me to have forgotten all, seeing you shame
not to say, that Christ speaks here of himself, as in the other places that
you cite for example. I am the Vine, and this is my body: have both one
Subiectum, by your sophistry. If Christ had said I am bread, as in the sixth of
John he said, I am that bread which came down from heaven: then your rule
would have served. But since he says, this is my body: it is manifest, that he
speaks of the bread and says that it is his body.

Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Paul, be no more on your side then they be on
ours. But rather their plain words do prove, that you for your reasoning
without probability, and contrary to the rule of all true reasoning, Watson
must be promoted.
are meet to be promoted out of the Hall into the Kitchen, or rather from the
Divinity School to the Logic lecture. For they all with one consent say,
that our savior Christ spoke not of himself, but of the bread affirming it to
be his body and his flesh. Which we do not deny, affirming the
contradictorie (as you say that we do) but we do most constauntly affirm
that to be true which Christ both spoke and meant. That is, that in the
sacrament, ye bread is his body, Watson denies Christ's words to be true.
and the wine his blood. But you and your sort do deny his words to be true,
and do affirm the contradictory: for you say there is neither bread nor wine
remaining in the sacrament. So that when Christ took bread in his hand, and
speaking of the bread said, this is my body: the bread was not his body (by
your doctrine) but his body was there under the accidents of bread, and the
substance of the bread (as some of you say) turned into the body of Christ:
or as some other teach, the substance of the bread being conueighed away: the
substance of Christ's body comes in place under the accidents of that bread
that was there. These be fond and false gloses, neither true nor lykely, nor
yet tolerable. But if you and your sort do not believe, and therefore can not
understand, How the bread is Christ's body.
how Christ's body and blood can be in the sacrament, unless the substance of
bread and wine be done away, and will therefore ask the unfaithful question,
how: then I must tell you, that even as all true Christians are the members of
Christ, of his flesh and of his bones: so is the sacrament (received of such)
his very body and his blood mystically. Ephesi. 5.
But for your really, substancially, and corporally: we can no skill of,
because we find them not in the holy Scriptures, neither yet in the ancient
Orthodox Fathers.

August. sermon. ad Infantes.
Saint Austen in his Sermon Ad infantes, cited by saint Beda, says thus. Si
ergo vos estis corpus Christi and membra, mysterium vestrum in mensa Domini
positum est, mysterium Domini accipitis, ad id quod estis, amen, respondetis.
If you therefore, be the body and members of Christ: the mystery of you, is
set upon the Lords table, ye receive the mystery of the Lord, you answer
Amen, to that which you your selves are.

Again, the same saint Austen, writing against Adimantus: says thus. Non
dubitauit Dominus dicere, hoc est corpus meum, cum signum daret corporis sui.
August. ad Adimantum Cap. 12.
The Lord did not doubt to say, this is my body: when he gave the sign of his
body. A sign it could not be, if it were not a thing that might signify.

It is manifest therefore, both by the express words of the Scripture, and
also by the judgment of saint Austen: that the thing that our savior spoke
of, when he said this is my body: was bread. And because he had appointed it
to be a sacrament of his body: he gave it the name of that thing that it was a
sacrament of. And sacramentally, or mystically, it was his body and blood that
he spoke of.

Moreover the nature of a sacrament does move me very much to believe still,
as I do. WATSON. Division. 18
For where as every sacrament of the new Testament is a visible form of an
invisible grace, as saint Augustine says, it can not be a sacrament of the
new Testament, except it have a promise of some, such grace to be given, to
the worthy receyuer, as is signified by the outward form of the sacrament. As
in baptism the water, which is the outward form signifies the grace of
salvation and remission of sins, which grace is both given to the worthy
receyuer, and is also promised in scripture to be given, by the mouth of Christ
saying: Qui crediderit and baptizatus fuerit, saluus erit: Mar. 16.
He that believes and is baptized, shall be saved.

Even so the outward element of this sacrament, which is bread and wine, does
signify the grace of the unity of Christ's mystical body, that like as one
bread is made of many graynes, one wine is pressed out of many Grapes: so one
mystical body of Christ is compact and united of the multitude of all Christen
people, as saint Cyprian says.

Now if our sacrament be bread and wine, as they say then shall they find the
promise of this grace, Cypri. li. 1. Epist. 6.
or of some other in the Scriptures made to the receyuer of bread and wine. And
if there be no promise in all the scriptures made to the receiving of bread and
wine, then be they no sacraments: John. 6.
But if they will look in the sixth Chapter of saint John, they shall find
this grace of the mystical unity promised, not to the receiving of bread and
wine, but to the worthy receiving of Christ's body and blood: where Christ
says, he that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, he abides in me, and
I in him, and so is joined and incorporate into one mystical body with him.

Our sacrament therefore that has the promise annexed unto it, is not bread and
wine be they never so much appointed to signify heavenly things (as they say)
but the very body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, the bread that came
from heaven.

CROWLEY.
It is said, that there was once one so malicious, that when he perceived, that
asking for himself what he would, he should receive it, but yet upon such
condition, that another whom he hated, should receive double so much of the
same: he being desirous to do the greatest mischief he could to the other,
asked that one of his own eyes might be put out, for then he knew that the
other should loose both his.

This man's malice was but little in comparison of yours (M. Watson) for to have
one of your neyghbors eyes put out: you will not stick to put out both your
own eyes your self. You tell us that saint Austen says (but you tell us not
where) that every sacrament of the new testament, is a visible form of an
invisible grace. And that it can not be a sacrament of the new testament,
except it have a promise of some such grace to be given to the worthy
receyuer, as is signified by the outward form of the Sacrament. etc.

Watson has lost five of the Popes seven sacraments.
By this you have at one blow stricken of from the number of your holy fathers
sacraments, no more but five. For where will you find in all the Scripture:
that either confirmation, order, matrimony, penance, or extreme unction, are
such sacraments as you speak of? Or that they or any of them, have any such
grace promised to the worthy receyuer of them?

Well. Thus you have dispossessed your self of five sacraments, in hope to
spoil us of one. But let us see whether we cannot keep our two sacraments
still, and so disappoint you of your purpose. Baptism you do grant us, for
you say water is ye visible or outward form, and does signify the grace of
salvation, and remission of sins. Which grace is not only given to the worthy
receyuer: but also promised by Christ's own mouth, when he says. Qui
crediderit. etc. He that will believe and be baptized: shall be saved. But
fearing least you should mar all: you leave out the words that follow. Qui
vero non crediderit: condemnabitur. But he that will not believe shall be
damned. Where is now the grace of salvation and forgiveness of sins, that is
promised to the outward baptising or washing in water? Take away belief, and
there is no forgiveness of sins at all. No not though you be baptized in
water a thousand times. Belief must go before, and baptising in water must
follow after, as a seal or confirmation of the faith. And whosoever does
believe, will surely be baptized: according to the institution of him in whom
he does believe. The cause why children be baptized.
And such as do believe that the promise of forgiveness of sins through
Christ, does apperteyne to them and to their seed: will not fail to beg
baptism for their children also, that when they shall come to the years of
discretion, they may be put in remembrance that they were dedicated to God,
and that therefore they ought to lead a godly life, as it becomes such to
do. And so many among these, as shall be found worthy, that is to say,
elected in Christ before the beginning of the world: shall surely be saved, as
our Savior Christ has promised. But such among them as were not elected in
Christ from the beginning, shall not be saved: although they do believe after
a sort, as Judas and Simon Magus did, and be baptized too. For only Gods
elect, are effectually baptized, and do effectually believe.

Baptism therefore, is a visible or outward sign of an invisible grace,
which grace is by the promise of Christ, so annexed to the outward ministration
of the visible element water: that in Gods elect it never fails, but is ever
more effectual. Election in Christ makes men worthy forgiveness of sins.
But in the other that are not elected: it is effectual in preaching lively
the invisible grace, that is by Christ, but it can not make them partakers of
that grace, because they be not worthy of it. That is, they be not elected in
Christ: which election alone, is it that makes men worthy.

Thus have we one sacrament with your consent (M. Watson) now let us see
whether we can keep another also, maugre your beard. But first let us try if
there be not some contradiction in your words. First you say, that the
outward element in this sacrament, is bread and wine, Cypri. li. 1. Epist. 6.
and that it does signify the grace of the unity of Christ's mystical body.
etc. And this you confirm by the testimony of saint Cyprian. And afterward
you say, that our sacrament that has the promise annexed unto it: is not
bread and wine, Contradiction in Watsons words.
but the very body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, the bread that came from
heaven. Now, if yea and nay, may be contrary: then is there contradiction in
your words. But to the matter. There is no promise of grace, made in the
scripture, to the worthy receyuer of bread and wine: Wherefore, it is manifest,
that bread and wine can be no sacrament. The same reason might be made against
that which you have said of baptism. For as I have declared before: there is
no promise of grace made in the scriptures, to the washing in water alone: but
the promise is made to the believer, which believing, will be baptized. Those
therefore that did put to that part of the definition of a sacrament, did not
mind thereby to show the difference between the sacraments of the old and
new Testament: but to signify, that without faith in the promise made in
Christ, it should not avail to receive any sacrament. Faith therefore is it,
that has the promise of grace annexed unto it.

You have said, that if we would look in the sixth Chapter of saint John's
Gospel, we should find, that the promise of the mystical unity that is
amongst christians, is not made to the receiving of bread and wine: but to the
worthy receiving of Christ's body and blood. We have looked there, and have
found it even so. And we have found also, that the worthy receiving of the
body and blood of Christ: is the receiving of it in faith. For Christ says
there. Amen amen dico vobis, qui credit in me, habet vitam aeternam. He that
believes in me, has everlasting life. And again. Sicut misit me viuens
Pater, and ego viuo propter patrem: and qui manducat me, and ipse viuet propter
me. Even as the living father has sent me, and I do live through the father:
so he that eats me, the same shall also live by the means of me.

Tractatu. 26.
S. Austen expounding this sixth Chapter of S. John's Gospel says thus. Daturus
ergo Dominus Spiritum sanctum, dixit se panem qui de coelo descendit, hortans
vt credamus in eum credere enim in eum, hoc est manducare panem viuum. When the
Lord therefore would give the holy Ghost, he called himself the bread that
came down from heaven, exhorting us to believe in him. For, to believe in him,
is to eat the living bread. And in the same treatise, speaking of the visible
sacrament: he says thus. Nam and nos hodie accepimus visibilem cibum: sed
aliud est sacramentum, aliud est virtus sacramenti. For we also, have this day
received visible food: but the sacrament is one thing, and the virtue and
strength of the sacrament, is another thing. And again. Hic est ergo panis qui
de coelo descendit: vt si quis manducauerit ex ipso, non moriatur. Sed quod
pertinet ad vim sacramenti, non quod pertinet ad visibile sacramentum. Qui
manducat intus, non foris: Qui manducat in cord, non qui premit dente. This is
therefore the bread that came down from heaven: that if any man should eat
thereof, the same might not die. But yet that which appertains to the virtue
and force of the sacrament: not that which belongs to the visible sacrament.
He that eats within, not without. He that eats in his heart: not he that
crusheth it with his teeth. And again he says. Hoc est ergo manducare illam
escam, and illum bibere potum: in Christo manner, and illum manentem in se
habere. Ac per hoc qui non manet in Christo, and in quo non manet Christus:
proculdubio, nec manducat spiritaliter carnem eius, nec bibit eius sanguinem,
licet carnaliter and visibiliter premat dentibus, sacramentu^ corporis and
sanguinis Christi: sed magis tantae rei sacramentum, ad iudicium sibi manducat
and bibit. This is therefore to eat that meat and to drink that drink: for a
man to dwell in Christ, and to have Christ dwelling in him. And by this means,
he that dwells not in Christ, and in whom Christ dwells not: without
doubt, he does neither eat his flesh nor drink his blood spiritually:
although he do fleshly and visibly crushe with his teeth, the sacrament of the
body and blood of Christ, but he does rather eat and drink the sacrament of
so great a thing, to his own condemnation.

Here appears plainly the judgment of saint Austen, concerning the outward
and visible sacrament: and also touching the inward thing, signified by the
outward sign. The outward sign is bread and wine: and the thing signified,
is the body and blood of Christ. Of the first, may such be partakers as shall
perish, because they be not elected in Christ: but of the other can none be
partaker, but such as shall be saved and can not perish, because they be
elected in Christ, before ye beginning of the world. And therefore saint Austen
says afterward. Res vero ipsa cuius and sacramentum est: omni homini ad
vitam, nulli ad exitium, quicu^que eius particeps fuerit. The thing it self
whereof it is a sacrament, is life unto every man that shall be partaker
thereof, whosoever he be, and destruction to none.

Only Gods elect have commodity by Christ's sacraments.
The promise therefore, can not be made, to the receiver of the outward and
visible sacrament, who receives nothing but the visible and outward element:
but the promise is made to the worthy receyuer, that is to the elected and
chosen of God, who receives both the outward and visible element, and the
inward virtue that is signified thereby. And it is unto him life, because he
dwells in Christ, and has Christ dwelling in him. Yea he eats Christ
daily by faith, notwithstanding that he be sometime for a long season holden,
from the use of the outward and visible sacraments. For God has not so tied
his grace to the outward sacraments: that he can not save without them.

To conclude this matter, I would wish you (M. Watson) to look once again in
the sixth Chapter of saint John's Gospel that you would have us to look in. You
shall find therein (not many words after the promise that you do so greatly
urge) these open and plain words. Amen amen dico vobis, nisi manducaueritis
carnem filij hominis, and biberitis eius sanguinem: non habebitis vitam in
vobis. Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye eat the flesh of the son
of man, and drink his blood: you shall not have life in you. When you have
read and weighed this place: let us have your judgment, whether our savior
Christ spoke there, of the receiving of your sacrament, which you say is not
bread and wine, or of that manner of eating that I have spoken of before. If he
spoke of your manner of eating, then can none have eternal life: but such only
as do receive it so. And then what avails the promise made to the washing in
water, which you say is pronounced by Christ's own mouth? By Watsons doctrine,
no Infants can be saved.
For notwithstanding they be so baptized: yet if they die before they can be
communicants, they perish, nothwithstanding the promise made to them that be
baptized.

It shall be best for you and us both therefore, to say with saint Austen.
Hunc itaque cibum and potum societatem vult intelligi corporis and membrorum
suorum, In Ioha^. tract. 26.
quod est sancta Ecclesia in praedestinatis and vocatis, and iustificatis, and
glorificatis sanctis, and fidelibus suis. His will is, that this meat and
drink should be understood to be the society or fellowship of his body and
members, which is the holy Church, which consists of his predestined,
called, justified, and glorified saints and faithful ones. To these is the
promise of grace made and confirmed by sacraments. These believing the promise
do worthily receive the sacraments. And these, being prevented by death,
before they can come to the use of the outward and visible sacraments: shall
have life everlasting, because they are elected in Christ before the beginning
of creatures.

Luther, and such as be of his sect, WATSON. Division. 19
as taking his dreams for the ground of their faith: were much pressed with
this argument, deduced of the property of the sacrament: and saw plainly
that it could not be a sacrament of the new Testament, except it had a promise
annexed to the worthy using of it. And yet for all that, he would not
condescend to say as the Church says, that Res sacramenti, the thing of the
sacrament signified and not contained, which is the unity of the mystical
body, were that grace, which by Christ in S. John was promised to the worthy
receyuer of it: but went and sought about for another promise, and after much
pooreyng, at last he brought forth a promise (as he thought) meet and
convenient, which is, the words of Christ, Quod pro vobis tradetur. Which
shall be given for you. And in this point, 1. Cor. 11.
he showed with what violence he handled other matters of our faith: that in
this great matter, so much ouershot himself.

First, with what face could he call that a promise: which has no apparaunce
of any promise, but that the words in latin be spoken in the future tense,
which in Greek be written in the present tense, both in S: Paul, and in Saint
Luke. Quod pro vobis datur. Which is given for you. And if they were spoken in
the future tense, as they were not: yet they be words, not promising a thing
to be done, but declaring what shall be done.

And further, if we should grant them to be words of a promise: yet they
promise not the grace of the sacrament, which is to be given to the worthy
receyuer. For the passion of Christ, or the gyuing of Christ's body upon the
cross, is not a grace given by the sacrament to the receiver: but it is that
work that has deserved grace to be given by the sacrament, for all our
sacraments, take their virtue of the passion of Christ, and do not promise the
passion of Christ.

This may suffice for this short time, to show unto you the folly of these
men, that neither wot nor care, what they affirm in these weighty matters. I
could say more in it, but that I have more necessary matter behind to be
said.

Augst. in Ioh. tract. 15. In Psalm. 138.
Saint Austen in diverse places, and other ancient Authors: have this doctrine
in their books. Elatere Christi, fluxerunt duo sacramenta. Two sacraments did
issue forth of Christ's side. And in those places, he teaches us by comparing
the creation of Eve, the wife of Adam the first man, and of the Church, the
spouse of Christ, the second man. Like as God casting Adam into a sleep, took
forth a bone out of his side, and thereof builded and created him a wife: even
so, when Christ did sleep by death upon the cross, upon water and blood that
came forth of his side, when it was opened with a spear, God did form and
build the Church, the spouse of Christ, in that by water we be regenerated, by
blood we be redeemed and nourished.

Now concerning our purpose, if two sacraments came out of Christ's side, we
are sure there came out no wine, except ye will say the wine of the true vine,
which Christ shall never drink with us any more, but after a new sort in the
glory and kingdom of his father. Therefore it must needs be, that our
sacrament is Christ's blood, and not wine.

CROWLEY.
If you had told us, when and where Luther wrote or spoke that which you charge
him with here: something might have been said to the matter, either in noting
his fault, or yours, or both. But for as much as you do but say it: I will
neither defend Luthers doing therein, nor condemn it: but pass it over, till
ye tell where, when and by whom he was so pressed. But for your own dealing I
must needs note, that you are very forgetful, since ye do so straightly
charge him, as with a great fault, for that, the like whereof is to be found,
even in your own assertion concerning this matter. Watson is faulty in that
which he reprehendeth in Luther.
The fault that you find with Luther, is for that he alleges a promise, made
in words of the present time or tense (as you term it) And have you forgotten
what tense Christ spoke in, when he said. Qui manducat meam carnem and bibit
meum sanguinem: in me manet, and ego in eo? Men say, it is a great fault, for a
man to be found faulty in yt thing wherewith he himself finds fault. Well,
if you will promise that you will do no more so: I could be content to wink
at this fault. Aduertising you to look better upon saint John's Gospel, where
you shall find (as I have said before) that he which eats Christ, shall
live by the means of Christ. Here is a promise made to him that eats Christ,
not sacramentally only: but by faith. As appears by the words that Christ
spoke before, saying, he that believes in me, has life everlasting. This may
suffice for answer to that great fault that you find with Luther: till you
tell us where and when he committed that fault. etc.

As touching the doctrine that you say saint Austen and other ancient Authors,
have in diverse places: I know saint Austen has the words: but the doctrine
that you would confirm by the words, is not saint Austens, but yours. You
cite the fourth treatise of Austen upon John: but in that treatise is not one
word that sounds any thing that way. You therefore, or else your printer,
have misreported the place. I suppose you would have noted the.xv. treatise,
where saint Austen says thus. Adam qui erat forma futuri: praebuit nobis
magnum iudicium sacramenti: Imo, August. in Ioh. tract. 15.
Deus in illo praebuit. Nam and dormiens meruit accipere vxorem, and de costa
eius facta est ei vxor: quonia^ de Christo in cruce dormiente, futura erat
Ecclesia de latere eius de latere silicet dormientis. Quia de latere in cruce
pendentis, laucea percusso: sacramenta Ecclesiae profluxerunt. Adam, which was
the shadow or image of one to come: did give us a great toke^ of a sacrament or
hid secret. Yea rather, God did give it us in him. For in his sleep, he
obtained a wife, and of his own ribbe there was made a wife for him. Because,
that of Christ sleeping upon the cross, the Church should be made of his side,
that is to say, of his side whilst he was sleeping. For the sacraments of the
Church did flow out of his side, which was pearsed with a spear, whilst he
hanged on the cross.

These words of saint Austen, have some show of that which you cite: but they
are not the same words, neither can have the same sense that you would those
words should have. As may well appear by the words that saint Austen adds
immediately after, saying. Sed quare hoc dicere volui fratres? Quid infirmitas
Christi, nos facit fortes. etc. But wherefore would I speak this, says saint
Austen? Because the weakness of Christ does make us strong. A great image was
it, that did there proceed or go before. For God might have taken from the
man, flesh, whereof he might have made the woman. And it seems that it might
have as it were, agreed better. For the sex that was made, was the weaker, and
the weakness should rather have been made of the flesh then of the bone. For
in the flesh, the bones are the strong part. He did not take from man, flesh
to make a woman of: but he did take a bone. And when a bone was taken out: a
woman was made thereof, and flesh was filled up in the place where the bone was.
God was able to have restored a bone for the bone that he took out, he was
able to have taken out flesh to have made the woman, and not a ribbe: what did
it therefore signify? The woman was made of a ribbe as being strong: and Adam
is become flesh, as being weak. Christ and the Church. His infirmity is our
strength. Thus far saint Austen.

As many as will, may by these words understand, what Saint Austen meant by
those words that go before, whereupon you would conclude, that the sacrament
(which you term the sacrament of the altar) is not Wine, but blood. For in
these words saint Austen shows his meaning to be far otherwise. He does in
diverse places of his wrytings use this manner of speaking: but in every of
those places, he does by plain words show himself, to mind nothing less
then to teach, that the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, The scope
of saint Austens doctrine.
is not bread and wine, but blood only. His meaning was (as it may be justly
gathered of his words) to teach that our sacraments take their worthynesse of
none other thing, then the worthynesse of the death and bloudsheding of our
Savior Christ, and that the infirmity of our nature in Christ, is become our
strength in him.

It seems to me a strange manner of reasoning that you use, when you say,
that for as much as there came no wine out of Christ's side: therefore, our
sacrament is not wine, but Christ's blood. If you will give me leave to reason
after that sort: I will prove yet once again, that the Church has but two
sacraments. For saint Austen says, that the sacraments of the Church did flow
out of Christ's side, and you say, two sacraments did flow out of his side,
that is to say, water and blood. Therefore I conclude, that the other five be
no sacraments: for they flowed not out of Christ's side.

Yea I will by this manner of reasoning, prove: that these two sacraments are
not whole sacraments neither. For the word and flesh flowed not out of
Christ's side: but without the word and flesh, these two sacraments, be not
whole sacraments: Ergo, they be but maimed sacraments. Saint Austen says. In
Iohannem tract. 80.
Detrahe verbum, and quid aqua, nisi aqua? Accedit verbum ad clementum: and fit
sacramentum. Take away the word from the water: and what is the water other
then water? The word comes to the element: and so is it made a sacrament. And
in the other sacrament, except you have two creatures, bread and wine, or (as
you term them) flesh and blood: it can be no perfect sacrament. Yea and the
word of faith is necessary here also. For as saint Austen says in the same
place. Hoc verbum fidei tantum valet in Ecclesia Dei^ vt ipsum credentem,
offerentem, benedicentem, tingentem, etiam tantillum mundet infantem etc. This
word of faith is of such force in the Church of God: that by it he does make
clean the believer, the offerer, the blesser, yea and him that baptiseth the
little infant, although it be not yet able to believe with the heart unto
righteousness, and confess with the mouth to salvation.

Watson concludes fondly.
A fond manner of conclusion is it, that you gather therefore (M. Watson) of the
flowing of water and blood out of Christ's side. For you do not only deny
your holy fathers five sacraments: but also mayme the other two. Yea, you make
the baptism that was ministered before the death of Christ, and the sacrament
of Christ's body and blood that was ministered at his last supper: to be of none
effect. And last of all, you affirm that part of the sacrament to be the whole
sacrament: which you and your sort do withholde from all Christians that be
not massing priests.

WATSON. Division. 20
Beside these circumstaunces and arguments deduced upon the scripture, there
be also other of no less strength then these, able to confirm any true
christen man in the faith of the real presence of Christ's body and blood in
the blessed sacrament.

And these be the effects of the sacrament expressed in the scripture, which
be so great, so glorious, so excellent and heavenly, that it were great
blasphemy to ascribe the same to bread and wine, which be only the works and
effects of almighty God, and of such creatures only, as Gods son has taken
and united to himself in unity of person which be the body and blood of our
Savior Christ.

The first effect is, that our Sacrament is the confirmation of the new
testament, as saint Matthew and saint Mark also do write: Math. 26. Mar. 14.
Hic est sanguis meus noni Testamenti, this is my blood of the new Testament,
that is to say: which confirms the new Testament, as all holy writers do
expound. Like as the blood of Calves did confirm the old Testament, Exodus 24.
as the book of Exodus does declare: so the blood of Christ our priest and
sacrifice does confirm the new Testament, which Testament because it is
eternal and shall never have end, is confirmed by the eternal blood of the
Lamb of God, that ever is received and never consumed, and not by any
corruptible blood, or any other creature of less value and efficacy.

In the old law, and also in saint Paul it is said. Exodus 24. Heb. 9.
Hic est sanguis Testamenti, quod vobiscum pepigit Deus. This is the blood of
the Testament that God has covenant with you he says not, This is the blood
of the new Testament. But if these words (This is my blood of the new
Testament) the Evangelist had meant, that it had been the figure of the blood
of the new Testament, what had he said more then Moses said before: for the
blood of Calves and Goats was the figure of this blood of Christ. And then
were the Jews and the old law of more dignity, then we Christen men of the
new law, because beside we both be but under figures (as these men say) yet
their figure was of more estimation then ours is, being (as they say) but
bare bread and wine: wherefore seeing these words of Christ (this is my blood) be
the form of our sacrament, the effect whereof is the confirmation of the new
Testament, it follows well, that the cause must be of like or more dignity,
and so by no means can be the material creature of wine, but must needs be
the innocent and precious blood of our immaculate and undefiled Lamb of God
Jesus Christ.

When you have after your manner, CROWLEY.
passed through the circumstaunces of this text. Hoc est corpus meum. etc. You
come to ye effects of the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ: The first
effect of our sacrament (say you) is to confirm the new Testament. etc.

Much ado you make about the confirming of the two Testaments by blood: The
old by the blood of Calves and Goats: and the new by the blood of Christ. If
you had been so expert in the wrytings of the fathers, as you would seem to
be: you would never have spent half this labor, about the confirmation of the
two Testaments by blood. Affirming that all holy writers do expound these
words of our savior Christ (This is my blood of the new Testament) to
signify, this blood does confirm the new Testament. Me thinks you might
have done very well to have named some one of these holy writers. But for as
much as you name none: I will not trouble the reader with any other expositions
of those words: then that which may justly be gathered of the very scriptures.

S. Paul writing to the Hebrews, says of the confirming of the old Testament
or covenant that God made with Habraham: Hebr. 6.
that it was confirmed with an oath, not with the blood of Calves and Goats.
Abrahae namque promittens Deus. etc. For (says saint Paul) when God made a
promise to Habraham: because he had none greater then himself by whom he
might swear: he swore by himself, saying. I will bless and multiply thee
exceedingly. etc.

As for the manner of speech that is used by Moses and the Evangelists, 1. Cor.
11.
in the places that you do cite: is plainly expounded by saint Paul when he
says. Hic calix nouum testamentum est in meo sanguine. This Cup is the new
Testament in my blood. And these words does saint Paul write, not as his
own, but as the words of the Lord Jesus: spoken at his last supper, when he
delivered the holy Cup to his Apostles.

The covenant of God is confirmed with an oath, and not with blood.
By this it is manifest, that the covenant which God made with Habraham, and
all the faithful that should believe that covenant or promise: was confirmed
with an oath, and not with the blood of Calves or Goats. But the blood of
Christ, wherein that covenant was made: was prefigured by the blood of Calves
and Goats, and is now kept in memory by the use of the Lords Cup, as saint
Paul teaches in the same place, saying. Hoc facite, quociescunque biberitis,
in meam commemorationem. Do this, as often as ye shall drink in the
remembrance of me.

The difference that is between the old Testament and the new: is plainly
showed by saint Austen, in his book against Adimantus. His words are these.
Duorum testamentorum differentiam sic probamus: Contr. Adimant. cap. 17.
vt in illo sint onera seruorum, in isto gloria liberorum. In illo cognoscatur,
prefiguratio possessionis nostrae: in isto teneatur ipsa possessio. On this
wise do we prove the difference of the two Testamentes: for that the burdens
of bondmen are in the one, and the glory of free men in the other. In the
old, the prefiguration of our possession is known: and in the new, the
possession it self is enjoyed. We therefore, that be christen men of the new
Testament, be not under figures, as were the Jews: but we are in possession of
the thing signified by the figures of the old Testament. And yet we may be
bold to say, that we have the signs or figures of the body and blood of our
savior Christ, to put us in remembrance of that possession, and do not doubt
to call the same by the name of the things signified, as saint Austen writes
against the same Adimantus. Non enim Dominus dubitauit dicere, hoc est corpus
meum: cum signum daret corporis sui. Capit. 12.
The Lord doubted not to say, this is my body: when he delivered the sign of
his body.

We hold therefore, that the confirmation of the old Testament, and of the
new both: is the oath that God made unto Abraham, and his faithful seed. And
that the thing promised, was prefigured by the figures of the old law. And
that the same is plainly represented and set forth before our senses, by those
figures that our Savior has instituted: not as a thing to come, but as a
thing already had in possession, and not to be forgotten of such as have
received it. We therefore are not under figures, as were the Jews, before the
shedding of Christ's blood: but we do use those figures that Christ himself
has instituted, to such purpose as he did institute them for. Neither do we
say or think that they be but bare bread and wine: but we teach, that the
worthy receyuer is by them assured, even as it were sensibly, that he is made
one with Christ and Christ with him, that he dwells in Christ and Christ in
him, that he receives into his soul whole Christ, We teach not that the
sacrament is but bare bread and wine.
even as he receives the sacramental bread and wine into his body. And to
conclude, that he has by Christ, everlasting life: even as our bodies have
this temporal life by the means of bodyly food, whereof the chief is bread
and wine, the one serving to strengthen man's heart, and the other to make it
cheerful and merry.

I conclude therefore thus. The oath which God swore to Abraham, is the
confirmation of the old and new Testament: Ergo, neither was the old
confirmed by the blood of Calves and Goats, neither the new by the sacrament
of Christ's blood. And so consequently, it is not any inconvenience at all, to
hold that the substance of bread and wine does still remain in the Sacrament.

Yet one other thing I must needs note, that in all this ado, that you make
about this effect of the sacrament: you speak not one word of the flesh of
Christ, but altogether of his blood: These words, This is my blood, must be
the form of our sacrament. etc. But in the next effect, I trust you will
speak as much of the flesh as you have done now of the blood, and so make us
a mendes for all.

WATSON. Division. 21. Lucae. 24.
Another effect of this sacrament is taught us in S. Luke, the 24. Chapter of
his Gospel. Where our Savior Christ sat down with his two Disciples that
went to Emaus, and taking bread, blessed it and brake it, and gave it to them.
And then their eyes were opened, August. de consensu Euangelestarum. libr. 3.
ca. 25. Theophiloct. in Lucam. cap. 24.
and they knew him. Saint Austen in his book De consensu Euangelistarum,
teaches us to understand this place of the blessed bread, which is the
sacrament of the altar: and says the effect of it is to open our eyes, that
we may know God. And Theophiloctus upon this place of saint Luke, writes
this. Insinuatur and aliud quiddam, nempe, quod oculi eorum qui benedictum
panem assumunt, aperiuntur, vt agnoscant illum. Magnam enim and indicibilem vim
habet caro Domini. By this scripture another thing is given us to understand,
that the eyes of them which receive this blessed bread, be opened, that they
might know him: for the flesh of our Lord, has a great and unspeakable
virtue. Here we may perceive both by the scripture, and also by the holy
Doctors and fathers: that the effect of this sacrament, is the opening of our
eyes to know God. And that the cause of that is, the flesh of Christ, which
is our sacrament, and in no wise can be either bread or wine.

CROWLEY. Watso^ seeks vauntage by translating.
First, you English the words of saint Luke after your own manner, to make a
show of the crossing that is used in the Popish Mass. Taking bread, he
blessed it. etc. As though the blessing had been the making of the sign of the
cross, upon or over the bread (for so the Popish Priests use to bless their
bread and Cup in their Mass) but if it would have served for your purpose to
have translated otherwise: you could have found occasion enough in the
circumstaunce of the text, to have said thus. Taking bread, he gave thanks,
brake it, and gave it to them. For it was his common manner, to give thanks to
God, his heavenly father, at the beginning of every refection. And none did
then use to bless, by making the sign of the cross (as your Papists do
now) wherefore it is manifest that our Savior Christ did not use it, either
at that time or any other.

How rightly you gather the meaning of saint Austen, in the place that you
cite: shall appear by his own words in the same place, which are these. Pro
merito quippe mentis little ad huc ignorantis quod oportebat Christum mori and
resurgere simele quiddam eorum oculi passi sunt: non veritate fallente, sed
ipsis veritatem percipere non valentibus, and aliud quam res est opinantibus:
ne quisquam se Christum agnouisse arbitretur, si eius corporis particeps non
est, id est Ecclesiae. Cuius vnitatem in sacramento panis commendat Apostolus
dicens. Vnus panis, vnum corpus multi sumus: vt cum eis benedictum panem
porrigeret, aperirentur oculi little, and agnoscerent eum. Aperientur vtique ad
eius cognitionem, remoto silicet impedimento, quo tenebantur, ne eum
agnoscerent. Neque enim clausis oculis ambulabant: sed incrat aliquid, quo non
sinebantur agnoscere quod videbant, quod silicet and caligo vel aliquis humor
efficere solet. For according to the deserving of their mind, which was as yet
ignorant, that it behooved Christ to die and rise again: their eyes did suffer
some such thing, not being deceived by the truth, but they themselves not being
able to perceive the truth, and supposing the thing to be otherwise then it
was: least any man should think that he knows Christ, not being partaker of
his body, that is of his Church. The unity whereof the Apostle does set forth
in the sacrament of bread, saying, we being many, are but one bread and one
body: that when he should give unto them the blessed bread, their eyes might
be opened and they know him. That they might be opened to know him: the let
whereby they were holden that they should not know him being taken away. For
they walked not with their eyes shut up: but there was something in them,
whereby they were kept from knowing that which they saw. Which thing is
accustomed to come to pass by the means of some daseing or humor.

Now let all indifferent readers judge, whether S. Austens purpose in this
place, None can know God, but such as be members of Christ.
be to teach us, that the opening of our eyes that we may know God, be the
effect of the sacrament of the altar. Or whether his purpose be rather to
teach, that none can know God, but such as be members of his body, that is,
of the number of his Church, the unity whereof is set forth in the
sacramental bread. And therefore the two Disciples, being members of that
Church that is Christ's body: had the blindness of their understanding taken
away, at the breaking of bread. And so they knew Christ, whom before they
knew not.

As for the words that you cite out of Theophilacte: do rather make against
you then with you. For where your purpose is to prove (as you conclude) that
the sacrament is neither bread nor wine: Theophilacte does even in the same
words that you cite call it the blessed bread. But this is to be noted, how
craftily you can make one sentence of two, leaving out the Periodus or full
point, One of Watsons shifts.
that in Theophilacts own works, stands between illum and Magnam. And
because you would not have your reader to look for any Periodus there: you
make no point at all (in your printed Copy) nor any sign of pawse. But the
translator of the Author has set it thus. Vt agnoscant illum. Magnam enim and
indicibilem vim habet caro Domini: Euanuit autem ab eis: neque enim ad huc
habebat corpus, quod multum corporali modo cum eis conuersaretur, vt ex hoc
illorum cresceret desyderium. etc. So that the whole might be englished thus.
Another thing also is given us to understand: that is: that the eyes of them
that do receive the blessed bread are opened, that they might know him. For
the flesh of the Lord has an unspeakable power. For it vanished out of their
sight: neither had he still such a body, as might be much conversant with them
after a bodily manner, yt thereby their desire might increase.

When these words be well weighed and considered together: they do rather
teach us, that the power of Christ's flesh is unspeakable in vanishing out of
the Disciples sight, then in opening their eyes. For he says not, that the
eyes of them that did receive his flesh, were opened that they might know
him: but the eyes of them that did receive that bread, where over he gave
thanks (which he calls blessed bread) were opened to know him. How can you
then prove by this place: that in the sacrament of Christ's body and blood,
there is neither bread nor wine.

Your conclusion therefore is to large, when you say, To large a conclusion.
that thereby men may see, that the opening of our eyes to see God: is one of
the effects of the sacrament that you talk of. And that in no wise the same
may be either bread or wine.

Christ says, Beati mundo cord: quoniam ipsi Deum videbunt. Blessed are the
clean in heart: for they shall see God. It is therefore the cleanesse of the heart
that works the effect that you speak of. And without that it can not be
wrought. And many thousands there be that receive the sacrament of Christ's
body without clean hearts: and therefore do not by the receiving of the
sacrament, see or know God. But let us see your other effects.

Another effect is, WATSON. Division. 22
the immortality of our bodies and souls, the resurrection of our flesh to
everlasting life, to have life eternal dwelling in us. This effect is declared
in the sixth of saint John. He that eats me, shall live for me, Joan. 6.
he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, has everlasting life, and I
shall raise him up in the last day.

Upon this place Cyrillus says: Ego enim dixit, id est corpus meum quod
comedetur resuscitabo eum: Cyrillus. li. 4. Capit. 15.
ego igitur inquit qui homo factus sum per meam carnem in nouissimo die
comedentes resuscitabo. Christ says I (that is to say) my body which shall be
eaten, shall raise him up, I that am made man by my flesh shall raise up them
that eat it in the last day. Cyrillus in Joan lib. 10. Capit 13.
And in his tenth book he says more plainly: Non potest aliter corruptibilis
haec natura corporis ad incorruptibilitatem and vitam traduci, nisi naturalis
vitae corpus ei coniungeretur. This corruptible nature of our bodies can not
otherwise be brought to immortality and life, except the body of natural life
be joined to it.

By these Authorities we learn, that the effect of Christ's body in the
sacrament, is the raising up of our bodies to eternal life. And also we
learn, that the eating of Christ's body is not only spiritually by faith (as
the sacramentaries say: but also corporally by the service of our bodies, when
Christ's body in the sacrament is eaten and received of our bodies, as our
spiritual food: and because it is of infinite power, it is not converted into
the substance of our flesh, as other corruptible meats be, but it does
change and convert our flesh into his property, making it of mortal and
dead, immortal and lively.

As the same Cyrillus writes in his fourth book: Recordare quamuis
naturaliter aqua frigidior sit, Cyrill. lib. 4. Capit. 14.
aduentu tamen ignis frigiditatis suae oblita aestuat: Hoc sane modo etiam nos,
quamuis propter naturam carnis corruptibiles sumus participatione tamen vitae
ab imbecillitate nostra reuocati, ad proprietatem illius ad vitam reformamur.
Oportuit enim certe, vt non solum anima per spiritu^ sanctum in beatam vitam
ascenderet: verum etiam vt rude atque terrestre hoc corpus cognato sibi gustu,
tactu and cibo ad immortalitatem reduceretur. The English is this. Remember
how water although it be cold by nature, yet by reason of fire put to it, it
forgets the cold, and waxes whot: even so do we although we be
corruptible by reason of the nature of our flesh, yet by participation of
(Christ's flesh which is life) we are brought from our weakness, and reformed
to his propriety, that is to say, to life for it is necessary that not only
our soul should ascend to an happy (and spiritual) life, by receiving the
holy ghost, but also that this rude and earthly body should be reduced to
immortality by tasting, touching, and corporal meat like to it self.

This place is very plain declaring unto us, that like as our selves are
revived from the death of sin to the life of grace and glory by the receiving
of Gods spirit the holy Ghost in baptism: even so our bodies being
corruptible by nature, and dead by reason of the general sentence of death,
are restored again to life eternal and celestial, by the receiving of
Christ's lively flesh into them, after the manner of meat in this sacrament of
the altar

And in his eleventh book he says, Cyrill. li. 11. Capit. 27.
that it is not possible for the corruptible nature of man to ascend to
immortality: except the immortal nature of Christ do reform and promote it
from mortality to life eternal by participation of his mortal flesh.

In the proouing of this effect of your sacrament: CROWLEY.
you deal as faithfully as you have done in the rest. First, how faithfully
do you deal, in cyting the words of our savior Christ, Watson will not leave
his old wont.
in the sixth of John, as meant of the sacramental eating of his flesh, whereas
the circumstaunce of the text will not suffer any such sense? For if he should
mean there, of the sacramental eating of his flesh and drinking of his
blood: then could none be saved but such only as do so eat and drink the
same. And contrariewise, none that do so eat and drink them, could perish.
For he says, he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood: has everlasting
life. It is manifest therefore that these words of Christ, be spoken of the
spiritual eating and drinking of his flesh and blood, and not of a sacramental
eating or drinking. For the sacrament was not then instituted neither did our
Savior Christ, go about to institute a sacrament of his body and blood at that
time.

But in cyting the words of Cyrill, in the fiftene chapter of his fourth
book: your faithful dealing is most manifest. If you had cyted Cyrillus his
words wholly as they stand in his book: they would have made to much against
you. And therefore, when you had said. Ego enim dixit (id est corpus meum quod
comedetur) resuscitabo eum: Christ said, I (that is to say, my body that
shall be eaten) will raise him up: then you pass over the words that follow,
which are these. Non enim alius ipse est quam caro sua. Non id dico quia natura
non sit alius: sed quia post incarnationem, in duos diuidi filios minime
patitur. For he is not any other then the same which his flesh is. I speak not
this because he is not another in nature: but because after his incarnation, he
does not suffer himself to be divided into two sons. All these words you do
slily pass over: because the meaning of Cyrillus in the other words, which
you cite, is made plain by these. And then you cite the words that follow.
Ego igitur etc. But you go not so far as you should. For Cyrillus says this
much more, in the words immediately following. Nempe impossible omnino est, ne
in territus and mors, ab eo qui naturaliter vita est superetur: propterea,
quamuis mors, quae propter peccatum nostrum in naturam nostram insilijt, corpus
humanum ad corruptionem impellat, tamen, quia filius Dei homo factus est, omnes
profecto resurgemus. Non enim potest natura nostra vitae coniuncta non
viuisicari. For it is utterly impossible, that destruction and death should not
be overcome of him, which naturally is life: wherefore although death, which
for our sins has skipt into our nature, do drive man's body to corruption:
yet because the son of God is made man, we shall all surely rise again. For
it is not possible that our nature which is joined to life, Christ's
incarnation is the cause of our resurrection.
should not be quickened. Here it is manifest, that not the eating, and drinking
of Christ's body and blood sacramentally, but the incarnation of Christ, is the
cause of our resurrection as Cyrillus thinks.

But you have yet another place of Cyrillus, where he says. Recordare. etc.
You have a marvelous grace in leaving out that, which should make against your
purpose. But this folly I do note in you, that you can not beware of cyting
matter for your purpose, which in the places that you cite, is beset with
matter against you, as though you were assured that no man had those books but
you, or that no man would take pains to weigh those places, or were able to
epsy your slights. Immediately before those words that you cite: Lucae. 7.
Cyrillus has said, upon these words, Adolescens, tihi dico, surge. Young
man, I say unto thee, arise. Non ergo verbo solum semper (vt diximus) verum
etiam tactu mortuos exitahat: vt ostenderet, corpus quoque suum viuificare
posse. Quod si solo tactu suo corrupta redintegrantur: quomodo non viuemus, qui
carnem illam and gustamus and manducamus? Reformabit enim omnino ad
immortalitatem suam, participes sui. Nec velis Iudaice quomodo quaerere: sed
recordare. etc. He did not therefore always (as we have said) raise up the
dead with a word only, but with a touch also, to declare that his body also
was able to give life. And if things corrupted be made sound again by
touching alone: how should we, which do both taste and eat that flesh, be
without life? For it will reform unto the immortality that is in it self:
those that be partakers thereof. Neither be thou wylling, after the manner of the
Jews, to enquire how: but remember. etc. as you have cited before.

Cyrillus does here go about to prove, that there was power in the body of
Christ, to make sound those corrupted things that he did but touch. And that
therefore such as do taste and eat the flesh of that body, must needs be
quickened thereby. But how does this prove, that the sacrament of Christ's body
and blood, being eaten: is the cause of resurrection and everlasting life to
the eater? By your understanding of Cyrillus: The sequel of Watsons doctrine.
his doctrine must teach us, that if the Capernaits had laid hands on Christ
and eaten him up every morsel, they had done very well and wisely: for so
they should have been sure of everlasting life. But far was that learned
father from so unlearned a meaning: as may well appear, even in the words
that you cite. For in using the similitude of water made whot by fire: he
shows what life it is, that does quicken us into everlasting life. Even that
life, which is Christ God and man, which comes unto us by faith, and makes
us forget our coldness of infidelity and lack of love, and does heat us with
most constaunt faith, made fruitful by love. And so we do profitably eat the
flesh and drink the blood of Christ, for we dwell in Christ, and have him
dwelling in us.

And yet more plainly does Cyrillus open his own meaning in the words that
follow immediately after the words that you cite. For he says thus. Nec putet
ex tarditate meant is suae Iudaeus, inaudita nobis excogitata esse mysteria:
videbit enim si attentius quaerit, hoc ipsum a Mosis temporibus, per figuram
semper factitatum fuisse. Quid enim maiores eorum ab ira Aegyptiorum liberauit,
quando mors in primogenita Aegypti seuicbat? Nonne omnibus palam est, quia
diuina institutione per docti, agni carnes manducaueru^t, and posts and
superliminaria sanguine perunxerunt, propterea mortem ab eis diuertisse. etc.
Neither let the Jew through the dullness of his mind, think that we have
sacraments devised for us, which have not been hard of before: for if he will
look well, he shall see, that by a figure, the very same thing has been done
ever since the days of Moses. For what was it that did deliver their fathers
from the wrath, when death did rage against the first borne of Egypt? Do not
all men know, that they being thoroughly enstructed of God, did eat the flesh
of a Lamb, and did annoint the two side posts and the upper posts of their
doors, with the blood of the same, and that therefore death turned away from
them. And a little after, he says. Et cuinis carnibus atque sanguine
sanctificati (Deo ita volente) perniciem effugiebant. They being made holy by
the flesh and blood of a Lamb, did (by the will of God) escape the
destruction.

I suppose that there is no man so mad, as to think, that these words of
Cyrill should be taken in such sort and meaning, as you take those words that
you cite. For then should Cyrillus be thought to ascribe the deliverance of
the people from destruction, to the eating of the flesh of a Lamb, and the
annoynting of the door posts with the blood thereof. Which were to far from
such christian knowledge, as appeared to be in ye christian Bishop.

Watsons conclusion differs much from Cyrillus mind.
Wherefore, I may conclude, that you conclusion is very far from Cyrillus
mind, when you say, that this place is very plain, declaring unto us, that
like as our selves (you should have said our souls) are revived from death.
etc. For it is plain by that which I have cyted out of the same Chapter of
Cyrillus, that he means to teach, that the receiving of the outward
sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, is all one with the eating of the
Passover Lamb in Egypt.

Lib. 11. and Capit. 27.
One other place you have found in Cyrillus. But by like your conscience told
you that it serves not so well for your purpose as you would wish, and
therefore you do but teach Cyrill to speak after you in English (a tongue yt
he never understood) but if he were now living, Watson teaches Cyrill to
speak English.
and should understand how you have handled him therein, he would (I doubt
not) give you worthy thanks. And that other men of judgment and knowledge,
may judge between Cyrill and you: I will cite his words in latin, as
Trapezontius has translated him out of Greek. Nexus igitur vnionis nostrae ad
Deum Patrem, Christus est, nobis quidem vt homo, Deo autem Patri, vt Deus
naturaliter vnitus. Non erat enim possibile, corruptioni subiectam hominis
naturam, ad immortalitatem conscendere: nisi natura immortalis atque
incommutabilis, ad eam descendisset, ac communione participationeque sui, a
mortalitatis nostrae terminis, ad suum bonum reformatos, eleuaret. Christ
therefore says (Cyrill) is the bond of our unity with God the father. Who is
naturally united unto us, as a man, and unto God the father, as God. For it was
not possible for man's nature being subject to corruption, to clyme up to
immortality: except the immortal and vnchaungable nature, had descended unto
it, and by the communion and participation of it self, lifted up from the
bonds of our mortality, such as be reformed or fashioned a new, according to
the goodness of that nature.

Now, let all men that have either learning or wit, judge how faithfully you
deal with Cyrill, when you say, in his name. Except the immortal nature of
Christ, do reform and promote it, from mortality to life eternal, by
participation of his mortal flesh. For who sees not, that Cyrill does there
speak of that immortal and vnchaungable nature in Christ: which came down
from the throne of majesty in heaven, to take our mortal nature upon him,
that he might frame and fashion us like unto himself. And so exalt us above the
bounds of our mortal nature. Which thing he did by receiving our nature unto
himself, and gyuing his nature unto us. And so is he the bond, whereby we are
fastened to God. But this is the manner of all your sort, in cyting the sayings
of the ancient fathers.

Here perchance some men will stumble, WATSON. Division. 23
considering that we believe the bodies of young innocents shall rise to
everlasting life, which we know never received Christ's flesh in the
sacrament.

But their doubt in this point may sone be resolved, if they consider that
scripture and the old fathers, speak after the ordinary working of God
making no prejudice to the absolute power of God, who oftentimes gives the
proper grace of the sacraments before the outward receiving of the same. As
for example. Without baptism in water and the holy Ghost, no man can enter
into the kingdom of heaven, John. 3.
as S. John writes. Yet we read, that the thief on the right hand of Christ
was saved and never baptized, and many converted suddenly to our faith were
made martyrs before they could come to baptism in water.

And saint Ambrose thinks Valentinian the Emperor to be saved, which dyed in
his journey before saint Ambrose which he sent for, could come unto him.

And therefore though baptism be necessary, and the ordinary door to
salvation, yet the proper grace of baptism is sometimes given by Gods
extraordinary and absolute power to such, as without contempt of the sacrament
by their will and earnest desire receive the sacrament of baptism, though not
in deed: even so they that be baptized, and have an earnest desire and longing
to receive Christ's body and blood in the sacrament, and by some violence or
impediment are let to receive it in deed: or such children as by baptism
have faith infused into their hearts, and are prevented by death before they
can prove and try themselves, (which probation saint Paul seems to require
before the receypt of Christ's body) having no contempt nor refusal of the
same, 1. Cor. 11.
but depart in the faith of Christ: These I say receive the grace of the
sacrament, which is the immortality of their bodies and life eternal by Gods
extraordinary working, without the receypt of the sacrament in deed. By this
little ye may perceive, what may be further said to this objection, if the
time and my principal matter would suffer me.

CROWLEY. Watson is not able to answer his own objection.
By making and aunswering of this objection: you would have it seem to all men,
yt this is all that any man can stumble at. And that this one stumbling stock
being removed, the way is so plain and clear: that none can stumble, unless
it be such as wilfully will stumble, in every plain way. But as you are not
able to answer this objection to the satisfiyng of any that knows and will
consider what the use of a sacrament is: so may there much more be objected,
whereunto you and the rest of your mind, shall never be able to make such
answer as may be allowed among those that have knowledge.

It might be objected, that Adam and Eve, with all the holy men and women that
were before this sacrament was instituted, and looked for the promise of God
made in his son: shall rise again in the last day and have everlasting life.
It might also be objected, that all, both good and bad: shall in that day rise
again and live for ever, either in everlasting joy, or in everlasting
torments, and wishing to die, death shall fly from them. I am sure you being a
Doctor of divinity, do know this to be true: wherefore I shall not need to
prove it. The words of Christ, John. 5. Marc. 9.
in the fifth of John and the ninth of Mark, may suffice for the proof of
both. All that be in the graves. etc. And their worm dies not, neither does
the fire go out. etc.

But let us see how you have answered this objection. You say that this doubt
may sone be resolved, if men will consider that the scripture and the old
fathers do speak after the ordinary working of God, making no prejudice to
the absolute power of God. But how have you proved that? I grant that the
scripture and the fathers do so speak, and do make no prejudice to the
absolute power of God. Shall we think therefore, that if the resurrection of
our bodies and everlasting life, be one of the effects of the sacrament of
Christ's body and blood: he must needs use his absolute power, in gyuing the
resurrection of body and everlasting life, to as many as we will hold from the
receiving of ye sacrament?

It appears, that in Aunstens time, such as were of your mind, durst not be
so bold, The use in saint Austens time.
as to presume upon the absolute power of God in this point: and therefore they
ministered the sacrament of Christ's body to the Infants so sone as they were
baptized, but we keep them from the receiving of it, till they be grown to
discretion, and be sufficiently instructed in Christ, and do know how to
examine themselves before they come to ye lords table. And if they die in this
mean while: shall we think that God must use his absolute power in raising
their bodies, and giving them everlasting life? We might as well keep all our
children from baptism, and say that God shall give them the proper grace of
baptism, by his absolute power without the sacrament. And so should we be all
one with the Anabaptists.

But vain is all that you have affirmed, of this effect of your sacrament:
Cyrill. li. 4. Cap. 15.
and therefore the objection and the answer that you make, can not be other
then vain. We hold with Cyrillus (whose words you have cyted) that because
the son of God is become man: all mankind shall in the last day arise out
of the earth. All the offspring of the first Adam that sinned: shall be raised
again by the second Adam that never sinned himself, neither was partaker of
the sin of the first.

The cause of the resurrection and immortality.
The Infants therefore (whom you call Innocents) being of the offspring of the
first Adam: shall be raised again by the second, whether they be partakers of
any sacraments or not. For the resurrection and immortality comes not by the
receiving of sacraments: Romans 6.
but by the incarnation of the son of God. And everlasting life in joy and
felicity is the free gift of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

And this free gift was given to all the elect and chosen children of God: even
before the foundations of the world were laid. But the reprobates, which be not
chosen in Christ, shall have by Christ (that has taken man's nature upon him)
the resurrection and immortality of their bodies: but because that they
believe not in Christ, they shall have this immortality in those torments that
their first fathers sin did deserve. The receiving of sacraments can not make
the reprobates partakers of endless felicity: neither can the lack of them be
a cause, August. De catechiz. rudib. Quest. in Leu. 9.84.
why Gods elect should not be partakers thereof. But they be the visible seals
of heavenly things: and being received without those heavenly things whereof
they be feales: they profit the receyuers nothing at all, more then
circumcision did Esau, and baptism Simon Magus. But when they do both
concur: then do the outward and visible sacraments, confirm the faith, and
comfort the weak and wavering conscience. These therefore be the effects of
Christ's sacraments: and not such as you imagine. But let us see what you have
more to say of this effect that you last spoke of.

This effect is commonly taught of many ancient authors with one consent. For
Ignatius one of the oldest calls this sacrament M^dicamentum immortalitatis,
Ignatius ad Ephesos.
antidotum non moriendi, a medicine of immortality, a preservative against
death.

And the great general counsel at Nice, Concilium Nicenum de Eucharistia.
writes that they believed these sacraments of the body and blood of Christ
to be Simbola resurrectionis nostrae, the pledges or causes of our
resurrection.

And Athanasius who was one of the chief men in that counsel, calls it
Conseruatorium ad immortalitatem vitae aeternae. Athanasius de peccato in
spiritum sanctum.
A conserve or a thing that preserves our bodies to the immortality of
eternal life.

Ireneus that was a great deal older writing against the heretics, that
denied the resurrection of the flesh, Ireneus lib. 4. Cap. 34.
proves it and confuteth them by the effect of this sacrament saying thus:
Quomodo dicunt carnem in corruptionem deuenare. quae a corpore and sanguine
Domini alitur? By what reason do they say, that our flesh goes wholly to
corruption, seeing that it is nourished with the body and blood of our Lord? and
in his fifth book he says: Quomodo carnem negant capacem esse donationis Dei,
Ireneus lib. 5.
quae est vita aeterna, quae sanguine and corpore Christi nutritur? How do
they deny our flesh to be able to receive the gift of God, which is eternal
life, which is nourished with the body and blood of Christ.

The greatest argument that Ireneus could bring to prove the resurrection of
our flesh to life eternal, was to allege the cause of that resurrection,
which was the nourishing of our flesh with the lively flesh of Christ in the
sacrament, not to this temporal life as other earthly meats do, but to
eternal life, as only Christ's flesh does, and this cause was believed and
confessed of all men at that time, both Catholics and heretics. In so much
that these heretics of our time, that deny this cause, that is to say,
Christ's flesh to be really given in the sacrament, and eaten of our flesh:
do give occasion, yea I am afraid, do give more then occasion, for us to
think of them, that they deny also the resurrection of our flesh, which is
the proper effect of it, although as yet, they dare not impudently burst out in
plain words, though they express the same evidently to all men's eyes in their
carnal and beastly lives.

To prove this effect further, I could bring in many more authorities, Hilarious
De Trinit. li. 8.
as the saying of Hilarious. Haec vero vitae nostra causa est, quod in nobis
carnalibus manentem per carnem Christum habemus. This is the very cause of our
life, that we have Christ by his flesh dwelling in our flesh.

But I will not in so plain a matter, through my curiosity seem to mistrust
the credire of you, that be faithful men. Therefore to conclude, knowing the
greatness and excellency of this effect, shall we ascribe it to so base
creatures as be bread and wine, which be not able to work such an effect? God
forbid.

CROWLEY.
Many ancient authors (you say) do with one consent teach this effect. As
Ignatius, the fathers of the Nicene counsel, Athanasius, Ireneus, and
Hilarious, and many more you could bring in, but you will not by curiosity,
seem to mistrust the credit of your auditorie. Well, let us see what your
ancient authors have said. First Ignatius, speaking of your Sacrament, has
said. Medicamentum immortalitatis. etc. A Medicine of immortality. etc. In
his Epistle to the Ephesians, he says thus. State fratres firmi in fide Jesus
Christi, and in eius charitate, in passione and Resurrectione, omnes in gratia
nominatim congregemini in commune, in vna fide Dei Patris, and Jesus Christi,
vnigeniti eius filij, primogeniti totius creaturae, secundum carnem ex genere
David: praeunte and deducente vos paracleto, obedientes Episcopo, atque
presbyterorum caetui, indiuulso animo: vnum panem frangentes, quod est
medicamentum immortalitatis, antidotus ne moriamini, sed vinatis in Deo, per
Iesum Christum: purgatio malorum expultrix. Brethren stand fast in the faith of
Jesus Christ, and in his love, his passion, and resurrection. Congregate your
selves together all into one place, in loving favor one toward another, in
one faith of God the father, and of Jesus Christ, his only begotten son, the
first begotten of all creatures, of the lynage of David after the flesh: the
holy ghost being your guide, and leading you thither. Obeying your Bishop and
the whole company of elders, with one consent of mind: breaking one loaf of
bread, which is a medicine of immortality, and a thing to preserve you that
you should not dye, but live in God through Jesus Christ: and a purgation, that
does expel evils.

This much has Ignatius written in the place that you cite. And can any
indifferent man gather of these words, that he meant here to teach, that our
resurrection is the effect of the sacrament of Christ's body and blood? I think
not. Yea I suppose, Effects do spring out of efficient causes.
that none can gather that meaning of his words, but you, and such as you are,
whom affection has blinded. Do ye not know, that effects must spring out of
efficient causes? And dare you say that the sacrament of Christ's body and
blood: is the efficient cause of our immortality. If you have any shame left:
you will not affirm it. For Saint Paul says, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 2. Cor. 4.
that the efficient cause of our resurrection, is the same that raised up
Christ from death to life. How can the sacrament of his body and blood be the
efficient cause of our resurrection, and immortality then, as you think you
have proved it to be?

If Ignatius were now living: he would not, I am sure, commend you as he does
commend those Ephesians that he wrote unto. For he should find in you, the
contrary of that he found in them, by the testimony of Onesimus their Bishop.
Whereupon he writes thus. Onesimus autem ipse, valde laudat vestram in Deo
moderationem and dispensationem, quod omnes secundum veritatem viuatis: quodque
in vobis nulla haeresis inhabitet: sed neque auditis quenquam, nisi solum lesum
Christum, verum pastorem and magistrum, ac estis sicut Paulus ad vos scribebat,
vnum corpus and vnus spiritus. etc. And Onesimus himself (says Ignatius) does
greatly commend your moderation and disposition of things in God, for that you
do all live according to the truth, and for that there is in you no heresy
abiding, but you refuse even to hear any other then Jesus Christ alone, which
is the true Shepherd and teacher: and you are, even as Paul wrote unto you,
one body and one spirit. etc. How far you and your sort be from the
harkening to Christ alone: may easily be seen of all that will consider, the
multitude of traditions that you have brought into the Church of Christ, and
do esteem them above the ordinance of God. Wherefore Ignatius might say unto
you, as he writes in the same Epistle. Similiter autem, and omnis homo,
quisquis indicium a Deo accepit, punietur si imperitum pastorem secutus fuerit,
and falsam opinionem vt veram exceperit. And in like manner every man, that has
received at Gods hand ability to judge: shall be punished, if he shall follow
an unskillful shepherd, and receive a false opinion as true.

Thus you see, that when Ignatius is well considered, he will be found none of
those ancient Authors, that do commonly teach this affect of the sacrament
of Christ's body: but contrariwise, he will tell you that you shall be punished,
for that you follow an unskillful shepherd, and accept a false opinion as
though the same were true. And even in that place which you cite, his words
are flat against your doings, and therefore you dissemble those words, and
begin with the next. He has written thus Vnum panem frangentes, quod est. etc.
Breaking one loaf of bread, which is a medicine of immortality, and a
preservative against death. Now tell me, how this breaking of one loaf of
bread, does or can agree with your private Mass that you call the sacrifice of
the Church: and with your Popish Easter housell, when every one has a mock
loaf by himself. Ignatius would have the Ephesians to break (that is to be
partakers of) one leaf of bread, and he says that is a medicine of
immortality, and a preservative against death. Watson was foul ouersene.
Why then. It is neither your private Mass, nor your Easter housell, that he
speaks of: but our communion. If I had been of your counsel before you made
this Sermon: you should never have cited this place for shame. Well it is out
now, and can not be called in again.

But now let us see, what the fathers that were gathered together in the
general counsel of Nice, Concilium Nicenum.
have said to this matter. They have called this sacrament, Symbola
Resurrectionis nostrae. The pledges or causes of our resurrection, say you. But
I would feign know where you have read Symbolum in that signification. I
believe you never read it in any of the eloquent Greeks or Latinistes. You
were sure that you had Auditorium beneuolum, A strange signification of
Symbolum.
and therefore you might be bold to say, that Symbolum signifies a cause:
and so translate Symbolum Resurrectionis, the cause of resurrection. But
perhaps you have some secret Authors, wherein you read Simbolum, written with
i^, and not with y. And that Simbolum it is that you translate so: for your
printer has so printed it. Well I leave this translation of yours, to the
judgment of such as be skillful in the Greek and Latin tongues. But to our
purpose. You shall never be able to prove that Symbolum signifies a cause: but
a pledge it may signify. And what have the fathers of the Nicene counsel done
for you then? Even as much as Ignatius has done before. I will not stick to
grant you both the sayings to be true. The sacrament of Christ's body and
blood, Medicines be not the efficient causes of health.
is a medicine of immortality, a preservative against death, a purgation to
expel evils, and a pledge of our resurrection. Are medicines, preservatives,
and purgations, the efficient causes of health? And how can this medicine,
preservative and purgation, be the efficient cause of our resurrection and
immortality? And is a pledge the efficient cause of the thing or deed that is
promised when the pledge is given? For in that sense is Symbolum taken here.
And unless you can prove that these be efficient causes: you shall never prove
that our immortality and resurrection be the effects thereof.

The like may be said to the Conseruatorium ad immortalitatem aeternae vitae.
A conserve, or a thing that preserves our bodies to the immortality of
eternal life. But because it is your custom to cite matter in such sort, that
the true meaning of the Author can not be perceived by the words that you
cite: I will let the reader see all the words that Athanasius does in that
place write of that matter. Sed proptered ascensionis suae in caelum mentionem
secit, Athanasius De p ccato in spiritum sanctum.
vt eos a corporali intellectu abstraheret, ac deinde carnem suam de qua
locutus erat, cibum e supernis, caelestem and spiritualem alimoniam, and ab
ipso donandam intelligerent. Quae enim locutus sum vibis, inquit, spiritus est
and vita. Quod perinde est acsi deceret. Corpus meum quod ostenditur and d^tur
pro mundo: in cibum dabi^ur, vt sparitualiter vnicuique, t^^buatur, and fiat
singulis tutamen, praeseruatioque ad Resurrectionem vitae aeternae. Ita qu^que
Samaritanam abstrahens Dominus a rebus sensibilibus: Deum esse spiritum
pronuntiauit, vt deinceps illa, non corporalia, sed spiritualia de Deo
cogitaret. But for this cause did he make mention of his ascension into heaven:
that he might draw them away from the bodily understanding, and that they
might afterward understand his flesh whereof he had spoken, to be food from
above, heavenly and spiritual nourishment, and such as he must give. For
(says he) that which I have spoken unto you: is spirit and life. Which is as
much as if he should say. My body, which is showed and given for the world:
shall be given to be meat, that it may be spiritually given to every man, and
that it may be to each man a defense and preservation, unto the resurrection
of eternal life. In like manner also, drawing the Samaritish woman from
sensible things: the Lord affirmed that God is a spirit, that from thence
forth, she should not think of God as of corporal things, but as of things
spiritual.

Now let the indifferent reader judge, how faithfully you have used your self,
in alleging the saying of this ancient Father. His ground is, the words of
Christ in the sixth of John. Where speaking of the eating of his body he says.
It is the spirit that does give life: the flesh profits nothing at all. The
words that I have spoken unto you are spirit and life. Which is (says
Athanasius) as much as if he should say. My body, which is showed and given for
the world, shall be given to be food, that it may spiritually be given to
every man, and that unto each man it may be made a defense and preservation to
the resurrection of eternal life. And to make his meaning plain Athanasius
says: that Christ made mention of his ascension into heaven, that he might
draw his hearers, from the bodily understanding. And further he says, that our
savior talking with the Samaritish woman: did draw her from sensible things,
affirming yt God is a spirit, that so she might imagine no corporal thing to be
in God, but al spiritual.

I can not therefore but think, that such as will join with you in alleging
this place to prove immortality and everlasting life to be the effect of the
sacrament of Christ's body and blood: are by obstinate wylfulnesse blinded, as
you do show your self to be. For it is as manifest as the clear sun
light: that his meaning was to disprove the gross opinion of all such as
imagine, The meaning of Athanasius.
that Christ should give his flesh to fill the bellies of men. And to teach,
that such as will benefit by eating of his body, must eat the same
spiritually and not carnally. And that when it is spiritually eaten: it is
Tutamen praeseruatioque ad resurrectionem vitae aeternae: A defense and
preservation, unto the resurrection of eternal life. But this is not to teach
yt it is the efficient cause of our immortality and resurrection, as you
labor, by this and other places to prove.

But now let us see what you have found in Ireneus, that was a great deal
older then Athanasius. He has said. Quomodo dicunt carnem. etc. By what
reason do they say, that our flesh goes wholly to corruption, seeing that it
is nourished, with the body and blood of our Lord? This place of Ireneus is
sufficiently opened before, in the answer to that which you have said of the
first circumstaunce of ye sacrament (which is, who it was that spoke these
words. This is my body. etc) and is plainly proved not to make any thing for
your purpose, either there or here.

Yet we have not said any thing to that other place which you cite out of the
fifth book of this Ireneus, where he says. Ireneus. li. 5.
Quomodo carnem negant capacem esse. etc. How do they deny. etc. I might put
you in remembrance of that which Erasmus writes concerning his judgment of
the authority of this book: for I am sure you can tell that he has written
thus. Censura Eras. Roterodami.
In hoc quinto libro, quum multa scripturarum loca diligenter explicentur:
quaedam tamen insunt, quae nisi quis comode interpretetur, non satis congruere
videntur cum bis dogmatibus, quae hoc tempore praescribit Ecclesia. Where as in
this fifth Book there be many places of Scripture diligently expounded: yet are
there certain things in it, which unless a man do well interpret, do not
seem to agree very well, with those doctrines that at this time the Church
does prescribe. Ancient writers must be read with favor. etc.
And afterward he says. Sed in huiusmodi multis, veteres illi cum candore,
nonnunquam and cum venia legendi sunt etc. But in many such things, those
ancient writers must be read with favor, and sometime with pardon also.

But be it that Erasmus had not given us this warning: is there not warning
enough given us, in the words of the place it self, to look well to the
writers meaning? You do, according to your custom, cite those words only,
which may at the first sight, make some show, of that you would prove by them.
But according to my custom, I will let the reader see the whole circumstaunce,
that he may be able to judge which of us both goes most nigh to the meaning of
the writer. His words be these. Vani autem omnimodo, qui vniuersam
dispositionem Dei contemnunt, and carnis salutem negant, and regenerationem
eius spernunt, dicentes non came capacem esse incorruptibilitatis. Sic autem,
secundum haec videlicet, nec Dominus sanguine suo redemit nos, neque Calix
Eucharistiae, communicatio sanguinis eius est, neque panis quem frangimus
communicatio corporis eius est. Sanguis enim non est, nisi a venis and
carnibus, and a reliqua quae est secundum hominem substantia, qua vere sactum
verbum Dei, sanguine suo redemit nos. Quemadmodum and Apostolus eius ait. In
quo habemus redemptionem per sanguinem eius, and remissionem peccatorum. Et
quoniam membraeius sumus, and per creaturam nutrimur. Creaturam autem ipse
nobis praestat, solemn suum oriri faciens, and pluens quemadmodum vult, cum
Calicem qui est creatura, suum corpus confirmauit, ex quo nostra auget corpora.
Quando ergo and myxtus Calix, and factus panis, percipit verbum Dei: fit
Eucharistia sanguinis and corporis Christi, ex quibus augetur and consistit
carnis nostrae substantia. Quomodo carnem negant capacem esse donationis Dei,
quae est vita aeterna, quae sanguine and corpore Christi nutritur, and membrum
est eius, quemadmodum and Apostolus ait, in ea quae est ad Ephesians. Epistola
Quoniam membra sumus corporis eius: de carne eius, and de ossibus eius, non de
spiritali aliquo and inuisibili homine dicens haec (Spiritus enim neque ossa,
neque carnes habet) sed de ea dispositione quae est secundum hominem, quae ex
carnibus and neruis, and ossibus consistit, quae de Calice, qui est sanguis
eius nutritur, and de pane, qui est corpus eius, augetur. Altogether vein are
those men, which do contemn the whole order that God has set, deny the
salvation of the flesh, and despise the regeneration thereof, saying that it
is not able to receive incorruptibilitie. For by this means, that is to say,
if these sayings be true: neither has the Lord redeemed us with his blood,
neither is the cup of thankesgyuing, the communion of his blood, nor the bread
that we break, the communion of his body. For it is not blood, except it come
from the veins and flesh and the other substance which is of man's nature.
Wherein the son of God being borne in deed: has with his own blood redeemed
us. Even as his Apostle also says: in whom we have redemption, the
forgiveness of sins through his blood. And because we are members of him,
and be nourished by the creature. And he it is that gives the creature unto
us, causing his sun to arise, and rayning in such sort as it pleases him,
when he said for a surety, that the cup, which is a creature, is his body,
whereby he does give increase to our bodies. When the mixed Cup therefore, and
the bread that is made, do receive the son of God: it is made the Euchariste
or thankesgyuing of the blood and body of Christ, whereof the substance of our
flesh is increased and does consist. How do they deny that flesh is able to
receive the gift of God, which is eternal life, since the same is nourished
with the blood and body of Christ, and is a member of him, as the Apostle
says in that Epistle which he wrote to the Ephesians. For we are members of his
body, of his flesh and of his bones, not speaking these words of any
spiritual or invisible man (for a spirit has neither bones nor flesh) but
of that disposition of parts, that is in man's nature, which does consist of
flesh, sinews and bones, which is nourished by the cup that is his blood, and
increased by the bread that is his body.

Now let the Reader judge, whether Ireneus may be understood to mean in
this place, as you by cyting his words, What manner men Ireneus had to do with.
would have him seem to mean. First, it is manifest by his words, that he
had to do with such men as did utterly deny the resurrection of our bodies.
And he proves that their assertion is very vein, since our bodies be
nourished in this life, by the same creatures that our savior Christ has made
the sacraments of his body and blood, which creatures we receive at his hand,
for he causes the sun to arise and to warm the earth, and he it is that
gives rain to moysten the earth, whereby the same bread and wine, that he
has assuredly said is his body and blood, do grow out of the earth, whereby
he does give our bodies increase.

And to what purpose should he institute the sacrament of his body and blood in
those creatures, if our nature, which he has taken upon him, and is nourished
by these creatures: should not by him be made incorruptible and immortal? How
can they therefore (says Ireneus) deny that flesh is able to receive the
gift of God, which is eternal life: since the same is nourished with that
creature that is the blood and body of Christ, and is a member of him as the
Apostle says. etc. Which words must be warily considered, least we should
think that Ireneus does deny, that the church of Christ is the spiritual or
mistical body of Christ, affirming that the same is his very natural body,
which he took of the substance of the Virgin Marie. Words that must be
warily considered.
But when these words be well weighed: it appears that Ireneus was earnestly
bent to disprove not only the opinion of such as do deny our resurrection:
but also their opinion that did affirm, that Christ took not man's nature upon
him, but had a fantastical body: and therefore, he applied the words of Paul
against that error, saying. Non de spirituali aliquo. etc. He spoke not those
words to the Ephesians, of any spiritual or invisible man, but of the
disposition of parts that is in man, which consists of flesh, sinews and
bones. Understanding Saint Paul's words in that meaning that the words of
Laban must be understand, when he said to Jacob. Genes. 29.
Os meum es and caro mea. Thou art my bone and my flesh. That is, thou art of
the same lynage that I am, and descended out of the same loins. So Ireneus
understands saint Paul's words in that place, to signify, that Christ and
we, concerning his man's nature, be descended out of ye loins of one man, that
is the first man Adam. And so he concludes, that for as much as our nature is
nourished and increased by those creatures bread and Wine, wherein Christ has
instituted the sacrament of his body and blood, and does therefore call the
same creatures, by the names of those things yt they be sacraments of: the same
nature must needs be made incorruptible and immortal through him that has
received it to himself, and is himself incorruptible and immortal.

Watson is to bold with Ireneus.
Wherefore it seems to me (M. Watson) that you are to bold with Ireneus, when
you affirm that his meaning is such as we find to be contrary to his plain
and manifest words. For he says that the blood and body of Christ that he
speak of, is that whereby the substance of our flesh is increased and does
continue. But you do deny that. For you say yt it nourishes not our flesh as
other earthly meats do, to this temporal life: but to eternal life. I would
gladly know therefore what Ireneus may mean by the increasing of the
substance of our flesh by this food.

Well, this matter is plain enough to as many as will see. And so it is, that
neither Catholics, nor heretics, did in the days of Ireneus, believe and
confess, that the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, is the cause of
the uncorruption of our bodies, and the eternal life of the same. And that we
which do now deny our resurrection and everlasting life in an immortal
state, to be the effect of the sacrament of Christ's body and blood: do not
give thereby any just occasion, to be suspected of the error of them that do
deny the resurrection of our flesh. And for that you charge us with
beastlynesse of life: for my part, I refer the judgment to them that know us
both. Let other answer for themselves.

Well. For further proof of this effect, you could bring in many mo Authors,
as the saying of Hilarious. etc. Hilarious has said thus, say you. Haec vero
vitae nostrae causa est. etc. This is the very cause of our life: that we have
Christ by his flesh dwelling in our flesh.

First, I must tell you that you show your self to impudent in translating the
text that you cite out of Hilarious in this place. Hilarious de Trinitate. li. 8.
Let the learned judge whether Hilarious have said, this is the very cause.
etc. And again in the end of the sentence, dwelling in our flesh. The words
in Latin for the first, are these. Haec vero vitae nostrae causa est. And for
the other, the words be these. Quod in nobis carnalibus, manentem per carnem
Christu^ habemus. If I should translate the whole sentence: I could not be
bold to say otherwise then thus. Truly, this is the cause of our life: that
we, which be carnal or fleshly, have Christ dwelling in us, by the means of
the flesh. But this is a common thing with men of your sort, not only to
allege Patches out of the fathers, in such sort that the true meaning cannot
by the words that you cite be perceived: but also, to make them seem to serve
your purpose, you will not stick to add somewhat in the translation that can
not be found in their words, as in this place it does most mafestly appear.

Censura Erasmi.
And how easy a thing it is for such as be disposed to apply the words of
ancient writers contrary to their meaning, to use the words of this writer
so: may well be seen by that which Erasmus has written in his Epistle, set
before this Authors works, where he says. Plurimum sudoris compereram in
emendando Hieronymo, sed plus in Hilario, cuius talis est sermonis Charecter,
vt etiam si res per se dilucidas tractaret, tamen esset and intellectu
difficilis, and deprauatu facilis. I did find (says Erasmus) much labor, in
the correcting of Hierome: but more in the amending of Hilarie. Whose manner of
speech is such, that although he did entreat of things which were of
themselves evident and plain: yet should he be hard to be understood, and
easy to be depraved. No marvel therefore, though you in this place, failing
of the first, which is hard, have happened on the latter, which is easy.
Affirming that Hilarious is one of those ancient fathers, that do teach, that
the resurrection of our bodies and everlasting life: is the effect of the
sacrament of Christ's body and blood.

Yea, and in the self same Book, out of which you cite those words, the same
Erasmus does judge him to teach doctrine that is not sound. And therefore in
the aforenamed Epistle he says thus of him. Et quum alias, tum libro de
Trinitate. 8. magna contentione defendit, nos quoque cum filio and patre, vnum
esse natura: non adoptione, neque consensu tantum. And both in other places,
and chiefly in his eight book De Trinitate: he does with great contention
defend, that we also, are all one with the son and the father, by nature, not
by adoption and consent only. And immediately after he says thus. Rursus eius
operis lib. 3. sed magis lib. 10. sic loquitur de Corpore Christi, vt sentire
videatur, Mariam virginem, praeter concipiendi, gestandi, and pariendi
ministerium, nihil addidisse de suo: cum orthodoxi credant, Christum ex
opificio quidem spiritus, sed ex substantia virginei corporis conceptum. Quin
and alia loca sunt, quae ciuilem and commodum requirant interpretem. Again in
the third book of the same work, but rather in the tenth book: he does so
speak of the body of Christ, that he may seem to think, that besides the
ministry of conceyuing, bearing in her womb, and bringing forth into this
life, the virgin Marie did add nothing of her own. Whereas, such as be of
right belief, do believe, that Christ was conceived by the work of the holy
ghost, but of the substance of the virgins body. Other places also there be,
which do require a courteous and gentle interpretour.

I suppose you knew all this before: Watson has a wrong opinion of us.
but by like you thought that all such as be not of your mind, must needs be
ignorant herein. Else you would have weighed Hillaries words better, before
you had cited them for your purpose. But let us see now how we can weigh them,
and what doctrine will ensue upon the taking of them in such sense as you do.
And if we find that some absurd doctrine will follow upon such a meaning as
you gather of his words: why should we not call to memory the words of
Erasmus in the Epistle above named, where he says thus. Nemo quantumuis
eruditus and oculatus, non labitur, non caecutit alicubi: videlicet vt omnes
meminerint homines esse, and a nobis cum delectu, cum iudicio, simulque cum
venia legantur, vt homines. There is no man, be he never so well learned and
circumspect, that does not slip, and in some point show himself to lack sight:
that no man should forget them to be men, and that we should read them with
choice, with judgment, yea and with favor also, as men.

But because you have (as you are wont) left out those words of Hilarie, both
immediately before and after, which might give more light to his meaning: I have
thought good to cite the words that you do, with somewhat of the circumstance.

Thus he says. Quod autem in nobis naturalis haec vnitas sit, ipse ita
testatus est: qui edit carnem meam. etc. And that this natural unity is in
us: he himself does in this sort testify. He that eats my flesh and
drinks my blood, does dwell in me and I in him. For no man shall be in him,
but such as he himself shall be in: having received into himself the flesh of
that man only, which has taken upon him his flesh. The sacrament or mystery
of this perfect unity, he had taught before, saying: even as the living father
has sent me, and I do live through the father, so he that cateth my flesh
shall live through me. For every comparison is taken according to the form of
understanding, that by the example that is proponed, we may understand the
thing that is talked of. Truly this is the cause of our life: that we which be
carnal or fleshly, have by the means of the flesh, Christ dwelling in us:
which shall live through him, in such sort as he lives through the father. If
we therefore do naturally live through him, as touching the flesh, that is,
having obtained the nature of his flesh: how should it be, but that since he
does live by the means of the father, he must needs have the father in
himself, naturally, as touching the spirit: And he does live by the means of
the father, seeing that his nativity has not given him a strange and
contrary nature, for as much as, that being that he has, is of his father,
and yet for all that, he is not by any vnlikelinesse incident to his nature,
separated from him; seeing that through his nativity in the strength of nature,
he has his father in himself. We have made mention of these things, because
the Heretics (which feign that the unity between the father and the son,
is only the unity of will) have used the example of our unity with God, as
though, when we be by service only and will of religion, knit unto the son,
and by the son to the father: there were no propriety of natural communion
granted unto us, by the sacrament of his body and blood: where as the mystery
of the true and natural unity, is to be preached, both by the honor of the
son of God, which is given unto us, and also by the son that is carnally
abiding in us, being bodily, and inseparably joined together in him.

In the latter part of these words Hilarious does plainly show the cause that
moved him to write after such sort as he does in the former part of the same.
The heretics (says he) which feigned that the unity betwixt the father and
the son, is only the unity of will. etc. By this it is manifest, that his
purpose was to prove: that the example whereby the heretics would prove, that
the unity that is betwixt Christ and his father, is but the unity of will:
does serve nothing for their purpose. For the unity that is betwixt Christ and
us, and through Christ between God the father and us: is not only in will of
religion and service, but natural and true. And in Christ, we are bodily and
inseparably joined one to another, and do altogether live by the means of
Christ, as Christ does live by the means of his Father. And therefore he says
as you have cited. Haec vero vitae nostrae causa est. etc. Verily, this is the
cause of our life. etc.

Now (M. Watson) call to memory, the admonition that Erasmus gives in his
Epistle, concerning the manners of speeches that this author uses in his
works, and touching the doctrine that he teaches in this book, wherout you
allege those words that we have now in hand: and then it shall appear to
you (I trow) that you have not used Hilarious well, in bearing men in hand,
that he is one of them that teach our resurrection and everlasting life, to be
the effect of the sacrament of Christ's body and blood. For if shall be plain
that he means to teach, that as Christ and his father be one in nature: so
Christ and we that do believe the promise that God has made in him, and
therefore be by love inseparably joined one to another, and do therefore
oftentimes come together, and be partakers of one loaf and one cup, whereby
this perfect unity that we have with God, and one with another, is plainly
preached unto us, and even our very senses certefied, that we are by faith
inseparably joined unto Christ, as members to their head, and by love one to
another, as members of one body amongst themselves. We must therefore in this
point, use both judgment and favor in the reading of Hilarious.

If you should therefore, go about by many such places as this, to prove this
effect of ye sacrament: you should in deed through your over much curiosity,
seem to much to mistrust the credit of your so faithful an auditory. Wherefore
you do well to conclude without any more to do. And as for the ascrybing of
the effect that you have spoken of, to so base creatures as bread and wine: God
is the efficient cause of our resurrection.
you shall not need to fear, if ye will with us ascribe it to him, that is
the efficient cause thereof, which is the divine majesty it self. But now
let us see what other effects, this sacrament seems to you to bring forth.

WATSON. Division. 25 1. Cor. 10.
The principal effect of all is to make us one body with Christ, which is
declared in saint Paul, in these words: Panis quem frangimus, nonne
communicatio corporis Christi est? The bread, which we break is it not the
communion of Christ's body (that is to say,) does it not join and knit us in
the unity of one body of Christ?

Chrysostom. in Paul. 1. Cor. 10.
Upon the which place of saint Paul Chrysostom notes, that he said not (it
is the participation) but it is the communion of one body. Declaring thereby
the highest and greatest conjunction that can be, saving the unity of person:
for the bread which we break, that is to say, the natural body of Christ
under the form of bread, which we break, and divide amongst us, not taking
every man a sundry part, but every man taking the whole and the same: And as
Cyrill says, Cyrillus. li. 12. Capit. 32.
Gods son going into every man, as it were by division of himself, yet
remains whole without any division in every man: this bread (I say) is the
communion of Christ's body, that is to say, makes us that be diverse in our
own substance to be all one mystical body in Christ, endued all with one
holy spirit, whereby the influence of Christ's grace, that is our head, is
derived and deduced unto us, that be members of his body, flesh of his flesh,
and bones of his bones.

Chrysostom. in Paul. 1. Cor. 10.
Thus does Chrysostom expound the words of S. Paul. Quid enim appellio
(inquit) communicationem? idem ipsum corpus sumus: quidnam est panis? corpus
Christi: quid autem fiunt qui accipiunt corpus Christi? non multa sed vnum
corpus. What means saint Paul, when he says (the communion) he means that
we be all one body: What means he by this word (bread) the body of Christ.
What are they made, that receive the body of Christ? they are not made many
bodies, but one body. And therefore saint Paul says by and by after Vnus
panis vnum corpus multi sumus, omnes enim de vno pane participamus. We that be
many, are made one bread one body, for because all we do receive and eat of
one bread.

Here he tells plain, why we that be many in number, are all made one bread,
one mystical body, because (says he) all we eat of one bread, which is one
natural body. And this word (bread) here must needs be taken for Christ's
natural body, and not for material bread (as the heretics say) for it can
not be conceived, neither by reason, nor by faith, how that all we christen
folks that live now, and have lived since Christ's time and shall live till
Domesday, can eat all of one and the same bread, and eat also at sundry
times all of the same one bread, being one bread in number and not one bread in
kind (as some would make cauilation) seeing we be not fed Cum generibus and
speciebus, with kinds of bread (as the Logitianes say) but with singular
bread: except we understand by this one bread the bread of life that came from
heaven, the dread of Christ's natural body in the sacrament, which he promised
to give unto us all, whereof (as saint Cyprian says) Aequa omnibus portio
datur, integer erogatur, distributus non dimembratur, Cyprian. De Caena. Domi.
incorporatur non iniuriatur, and so forth, whereof equal portion is given to
all this delivered whole, and being distributed, is not dismembered, and being
incorporate into us, is not iniuried, and being received, is not included, and
dwelling with those that be weak, is not made weak.

And the reason why all we should be made one body, that receive one body, is
declared in Cyrill, Cyrillus de Trini. li. 1.
the Latin is long, but the English is this: We men being all diverse in our
own proper substance, according to the which one man is Peter, an other is
Thomas, an other Matthew: yet are we all made one body in Christ, because we be
fed with one flesh, and are sealed in unity with one holy spirit: and
because Christ's body is not able to be divided, therefore being of infinite
power, and received of all our diverse bodies, makes all us one body with
himself. Chrisost. in Math. hom. 83.


Which unity of body saint Chrysostom expresses by a similitude of Dough and
Leuine, that we are made one body, as meal of many grain and water, when it
is kned, are made one Dough or Leuine: his words be these. Veniat tibi in
mentem, quo sis honor honoratus qua mensa fruaris: ea namque re nos alimur,
quam angeli videntes tremunt, nec absque pauore propter fulgorem, qui inde
resilit aspicere possunt, and nos in vnam cum illo massam reducimur. Christi
corpus vnum and cara vna. etc. Remember with what honor thou art honored, of
what table thou eatest for we are fed with that thing at which the Angels
looking upon, do tremble and quake, and without great fear be not able to
behold it for the brightness, that comes from it, and we are brought into
one heap of Leuine with him, being one body of Christ, and one flesh, for by
this mystery he joins himself to all the faithful and those children, whom
he has brought forth, he does not commit them to be nourished of an other, but
he himself most diligently and lovingly does feed them with himself.

Let my masters of the new learning tell me, how that these words can be any
ways applied and verified of bread and wine with all their figurative speeches
and hyperbolies.

This conjunction also of us with Christ, Cyrill expresses by a similitude of
two waxes melted and mingled together. Cyrillus li. 10. Cap. 17. and libr. 4.
ca. 17.
Quemadmodum si quis igne liquefactam ceram aliae cerae similiter liquefactae
ita miscuerit, vt vnum quid ex vtrisque factum videatur: sic communicatione
corporis and sanguinis Christi ipse in nobis est, and nos in ipso. etc. Like as
if a man mingle one wax melted with an other wax melted, so that one whole
thing of them both be seen to be made, even so by the communion and receiving
of Christ's body and blood, he is in us and we in him, for otherwise the
corruptible nature of our bodies could not be brought to incorruption, except
the body of natural life were joined to it.

Hilarious also, the great learned and godly Bishop says: Per communionem
sancti corporis, Hilarious in Psalm. 6.
in communionem deinceps sancti corporis collocamur. By the communion of his
holy body, we are afterward placed and brought into the communion of his holy
body.

In such a plain matter as this is, what need I to heap places one above
another, all the fathers be full of it. Wherefore seeing the effect of this
sacrament is to be made one mystical body with Christ, flesh of his flesh,
and bones of his bones, as saint Paul says: Ephesians. 5. Cyrillus. li. 10.
Capit. 13. Hilarious de trini. li. 8.
which union (as Cyrill says) is not only by will, affection, faith, and
charity, but also carnal and natural (as Hilary says) by Christ's flesh
mingled with our flesh by the way of meat: I can not see, but that it is great
wickedness and plain blasphemy to ascribe this glorious effect to the needy
elements of this world, as to bread and wine, but only to the body and blood
of our savior Christ, as to the only substance of the blessed sacrament of
the altar.

Now, CROWLEY.
you are come to the principal and chief effect of your sacrament of the
altar. Which you say, is to make us one body with Christ. This ye will prove
first by the words of Paul to the Corinthes, which are these. Panis quem
frangimus. etc. The bread which we break. etc. 1. Cor. 10.
How far the meaning of Saint Paul in the place that you cite, does differ
from your meaning in cyting his words: may easily appear to as many as will
and are able to judge indifferently. I dare therefore say to such as shall
read this answer, as saint Paul says there, to the Corinthians. Vos ipsi
iudicate quod dico. Be you your selves judges of that which I speak. Saint
Paul's purpose in that place, is to persuade the Corinths: that they might in
no case match christen religion with Idol service. For a little after those
words that you cite, he says. Nolo vos fieri socios Demoniorum. Non potestis
Calicem Domini bibere, and Calicem Demoniorum. Non potestis mensae Domini
participes esse, and mensae Demoniorum. I would not (says saint Paul) that
you should be made companions of Deuilles. You can not, or you may not drink
the Lords cup, and the cup of the Devils. You may not be partakers of the
Lords table, and of the table of the Devils. By which words it is manifest,
that saint Paul did purpose to persuade the Corinthes, that such as would be
christians, must withdraw themselves from all Idolatry, and keep the
religion of Christ pure and unspotted, with the mixture of any heathenish Gods
service. But you (M. Watson) will make us believe that saint Paul means to
teach, that our knitting together into one body with Christ: is the effect of
your sacrament of the altar. For so you do expound the words that you cite
out of Paul. Nonne communicatio. etc. That is to say (say you) does it not
join and knit us in the unity of one body in Christ? Saving that I do know
it to be your common custom, thus to handle both the scriptures, and the
wrytings of the ancient fathers: I would wonder that ever you could for shame
make such interpretation of these words. But nothing may be wondered at, which
custom has made common.

Chrysostom in 1. Cor. 10.
But you have Chrysostom, to take your part, you say, who notes upon this
place, that Paul says not, it is the participation, but the communion of one
body. First I must note here, that you have done, you wot not what. For you
have found out for your masters of the new learning, that which some of your
fort have said, could not be found in any part of the scripture: That is,
that the sacrament of Christ's body, is called a communion. But let us see what
Chrysostom has said. For it were not wisdom to trust you when you cite his
sentence without his words, as you do here. His words therefore are these.
Quare non dixit participatio? Quia amplius quiddam significare voluit, and
multam inter haec conuenientiam ostendere. Non enim participatione tantum and
acceptione: sed vnitate communicamus. Quemadmodum enim corpus illud vnitum est
Christo: ita nos per hunc panem union coniungimur. Why did he not call it a
participation? Because he was wylling to signify a greater matter, and to show
that there is great agreement between these things. For we do not communicate
in taking and receiving only: but in unity also. For even as that body is
united unto Christ: even so are we by this bread, joined together in union.

Now let the Reader compare these words of Chrysostom: with those that you
have used in your Sermon, as though they were Chrysostomes: And so shall he be
able to judge how faithfully you have dealt therein. Chrysostom says that
Paul does not call it a participation, but a communion, because he would by
that word signify a greater matter, then he could by the other, and show
that the things used in the communion, do very much agree with those that do
communicate. As though he should have said, it is a greater matter to
communicate with Christ and christians: then only to be partaker of those
creatures which be used in communicating. For such as do communicate with
Christ and christians, are become members of that body whereof Christ is the
head, and do receive from Christ, spiritual life, strength, and comfort, as
natural parts of a natural body, do receive natural life, strength and
comfort, from their natural head. And such as do communicate with Christians,
are coupled together in the fellowship of members of one body, not only with
these christians that are now living: but with those that have been before,
and those that shall be after also. And the creatures bread and wine do serve
very well to signify this communion both with Christ and christians. And
therefore Paul would use the word Communion, rather then participation. And
that this is Chrysostomes meaning in that place, is plain by the words that
follow and I have set down in writing. Non enim participatione. etc. For we do
not communicate. etc. Where, in the last sensence he says. Even as that body
(meaning the Church that communicates in unity) is united unto Christ: so are
we that be members of that body or Church, joined together in union, by the use
of this sacramental bread.

And here is another thing that makes very well for your purpose (M. Watson)
Chrysostom says. Per hunc Panem. By this bread. The matter or substance that
he speaks of, Chrysostom is no man for Watson.
does he call bread: but you and your sort will none of that. Wherefore
Chrysostom is no man for you.

But Cyrillus must help out with this matter. Cyrillus li. 12. Capit. 32.
He says (say you) that Gods son going into every man, as it were by
division of himself: yet remains whole. etc. But having little cause to
trust your report: I will cite his words as he wrote them. He says thus. In
singulos enim partibiliter transiens vnigenitus, and animam atque corpus eorum
per carnem suam sanctificans, impartibiliter atque integre in omnibus est: cum
vnus vbique sit, nullo modo diuisus. For, the only begotten son passing into
every one particularly, and sanctifying both their souls and bodies through
his own flesh, is after an impartible manner wholly in every one: seeing that he
being but one is in every place, and is by no means divided. If there were
nothing else to be gathered of ye circumstaunce of this place: the very words
are open enough to declare the meaning of the writer, to be far other then
you would have it seem to be. For he says. Cum vnus vbique sit, nullo modo
diuisus. Seeing he being but one, is in every place, and not divided by any
means. By which words it is manifest, Christ's manhood can be but in one
place at once.
that he speaks there of the divine nature of our Savior Christ, which is
present in every place, and absent in none. But his bodily presence, neither is
nor can be in many places at once, as S. Austen teaches, writing to Dardanus.
But besides this, the words that go immediately before do show, that Cyrill
makes this a mistical signification of that which was done by the soldiers
at the passion of Christ, when they did cast lots for ye coat of his that was
without seame. And he says. Nam quatuor orbis parts ad salutem reductae,
indumentum verbi, id est, carnem eius impartibiliter inter se partitisunt. In
singulos enim. etc. For ye four parts of the world being brought to
salvation, did after an inpartible manner divide among themselves, the garment
of the son of God, that is his flesh. For the only begotten son. etc. By
which words it is plain, that Cyrill means of that partaking of the flesh
of Christ, which is amongst the faithful by faith. By which faith we are made
one mystical body in Christ, and be by him endued with one holy spirit, and
be unto him as dearly beloved, as his own members, flesh and bones.

Chrysostom in 1. Cor. 10.
And yet once again Chrysostom must help to expound the words of Paul. His
words be these (say you) Quid enim appello (inquit) communionem? etc. What
means saint Paul. etc. As for the fault that your printer has made: I have
amended without any more to do, as in many other places of your printed
sermons I have done: but your own subtle dealing in the translation, I may
not pass over so. A man that had meant uprightly: would have translated the
words of Chrysostom thus. What do I call communion, says Paul? We all are
one and the self same body. And what is the bread? The body of Christ. And
what are they made that do receive the body of Christ? Not many, but one body.
Now, what helps this to prove your purpose? That is, that our knitting
together into one body, is the effect of the sacrament. The Communion, that is
to say, the action of the institution of Christ, in breaking of sacramental
bread: does teach that we which be partakers thereof, be all one and the self
same body, and because we be so, therefore we do frequent and use that action.
We are not therefore made one body by this doing, but being so before, by faith
that works by love: we do by frequenting that mystery, show our selves so
to be. And the bread is the body of Christ. Not as you would have us believe
that it is: but sacramentally. The effect of sacraments.
And by the common rule of sacraments, it has the name of that thing whereof
it is a sacrament, and is called the body of Christ, and such as do receive
this body of Christ, are made one body and not many. Not because they were not
one body before they did receive that sacrament: but because they be thereby
made known to be one body. For if the receiving of the sacrament should make
them such: then should it follow, that as often as they receive that sacrament:
they should afreshe be made one body, which can be done but once. And that is,
when (being elected in Christ from the beginning) they be in time moved by Gods
holy spirit, to believe in heart and confess with mouth, that Jesus Christ,
the son of God, has dyed for our sins, and is risen again for our
righteousness, and receive, or do consent to receive, or be meet to receive
the sacrament of Initiation ye God has appointed, which was in the time of
Moses law circumcision, and is now baptism in water. Thus are we first made
and showed to be members all of one body: and by the use of ye other sacrament,
oftentimes showed to be the same.

The business that you make about the other words of saint Paul, that is to
say. Vnus panis, vnum corpus. etc. One bread, one body. etc. might very well
have been spared. For when Saint Paul says, Omnes enim de vno pane
participamus: We do all take part of one loaf of bread: he means not to
streatch the universal sign, All, to all the members of the universal Church
of Christ, A note for universal signs.
as you would bear us in hand that he does: but to all the members of every
particular Church when they come together to communicate, and thereby to show
themselves members of one body. And ye this is his meaning may well appear, by
that he says thus to the Corinthians. Videte Israel secundum carnem. etc.
Consider Israel after the flesh. Are not all they partakers of the altar:
that do eat of the sacrifices? Paul's purpose in these words: is to open his
meaning in the other. It must needs follow therefore, that he means of
particular congregations, and not of the universal Church: as you would feign
have him to mean: you have therefore made more a do then needed.

Let us now see, what help you find at the hand of saint Cyprian. Cyprian
De Caena Domi.
He says. Aequa omnibus portio datur. etc. Equal portion is given to al. etc.
According to your custom: you do here also leave out those words, ye might
give light to the writers meaning. I will therefore set them in writing as they
stand in the Sermon that you cite. Iam nulla fit panis mutatio, vnus est panis
caloris continui, status integri, qui semel oblatus Deo, in sapore dulcissimo,
and candore purissimo perseuerat. Nec solos sacerdotes ad panis huius
dignitatis leuiticae, praerogatiua admittit, vniuersa Ecclesia ad has epulas
inuitatur, aequa omnibus portio datur. etc. As you have cyted. Now (says
Cyprian) there is no changing of the bread, there is one loaf of bread, which
has in it a continual heat, and is of sound state, which being once offered
to God, does still remain in most pleasant or sweet taste and pure
whytenesse. Neither does the prerogative of this leuiticall dignity, admit
priests only to eat of the loaves: the universal Church is invited or
bidden to this feast. Equal or like portion is given to every one. It is
delivered whole, and being distributed, it is not torn in pieces. It is
incorporated and not iniuried. It is received and not included. Dwelling among
ye weak, it is not made weak, neither does it disdain the ministry of the
poor. A pure faith, a sincere mind, do delight this tenant. Neither does
the narrowness of our poor house, offend or pincht in, the greatness of the
unmeasurable and almighty God.

If you had cyted all these words: Cyprians meaning would have been somewhat
more plain, to such hearers as had not been altogether blinded with affection
to that doctrine that you labored to maintain. It is manifest that Cyprian
does here speak of Christ, which is that bread which came from heaven, and was
figured by the Manna that fell from heaven in the wilderness, and by the show
breads, that were by the law appointed to be set before the Arcke in the
Tabernacle, and to be changed every day: whereof none might eat, but only
those Priests that were of the leuiticall line. But this bread Jesus Christ
being once offered, remains for ever. And all the whole Church of Christ, is
called to come and feed upon this bread. Every man that with pure faith and
sincere mind, comes to feed upon him: shall receive him whole. And though
he be by faith eaten of all: yet is he not, neither can he be consumed, nor
torn in pieces. Yea, a little before those words that I have written Cyprian
says. Vna est domus Ecclesiae, in qua Agnus editur, nullus ei communicate, quem
Israelitici nominis generositas non commendat. It is the only house of the
Church, wherein the Lamb is eaten: none is made partaker thereof, whom the
nobility of the name of Israel does not commend. By these words it is most
evident that Cyprian meant to teach, that such as shall be partakers of Christ,
must by election in Christ, be made meet thereunto, being commended by the
nobility of the name of spiritual Israel, whereof the carnal Israel was a
figure. And their Lamb, Manna, and show bread: Cyprians meaning was far
other then was Watsons.
a figure of that everlasting bread which he speaks of here. So far of is
he from confirming of that which you would prove, that is, that our knitting
together in Christ, is the effect of the sacrament of the altar, as you call
it.

Yet one thing more I must needs note in the words of Cyprian. He says that
all the whole Church is called to this bancquet, and that equal portion is
given to every one. How agrees this with your private Masses, and your
withholding of the one half of the sacrament from the lay sort.

But now to Cyrill once again. Cyrillus de Trini. lib. 1.
He must help you once more, to bear us down by strong hand, that our
cowpling together in Christ, is the effect of your sacrament of the altar. His
Latin is long (you say) and therefore you pass it over. But the English is
thus. We men, being all diverse in our own proper substance. etc. Well, though
the Latin were longer then it is; yet would I be bold to trouble the reader
with it: because it shall make manifest to all men that will read it, that it
was not the desire to avoid tediousness, that moved you to leave out the
Latin, but a purpose to blind the simple hearer or reader of your subtle
Sermon. The words of Cyrill in Latin are thus. Dissecti enim quodammodo in
subsistentia^ propriam, hoc est singularem, iuxta quam hic quidem est Petrus,
ille Thomas vel Matheus: eiusdem corporis facti sumus in Christo, vna carne
pasti, and vno spiritu sancto, ad vnitatem obsignati. Et quandoquidem est
indiuisibilis Christus (nullo enim modo diuisus est) vnum omnes sumus in ipso.
We being after a certain sort divided, every man into his own proper (that is
to say, his singular) substance, whereby this man is Peter, and that man is
Thomas or Mathewe: are made one body in Christ, being fed with one flesh, and
sealed unto unity by one holy spirit. And because Christ can not be divided
(for he is by no means divided) we are all one thing in him.

Now let the indifferent reader judge, how faithfully you have handled this
place of Cyrill. And as he shall find you faithful herein: so let him give
credit to the rest of your doings. Cyrill has said that we be all one thing
in Christ, because Christ can not be divided: and you say, that we be made all
one body in Christ, because we be fed with one flesh. etc. And because
Christ's body is not able to be divided. And you add a conclusion, as though
Cyrill had so concluded, The cause why Watson would not cite Cyrill in Latin.
and you say: Therefore being of infinite power, and received of all our diverse
bodies, makes all us one body with himself. No marvel though you would not
cite the Latin: seeing you were minded to swerve so far from it in your
English. But vna carne pasti: Being fed with one flesh, is the ground that
you build upon. As though Cyrill might not mean here, of that spiritual
eating of Christ's flesh, that Christ himself spoke of in the sixth of John,
John. 6.
where he says that the flesh (that is the fleshly meaning) does profit
nothing at all.

Yet once more must Chrysostom help to prove this effect. You say that he
does express this unity by a similitude of Dough or Leven. etc. His words be
these (you say) veniat tibi in mentem. etc. Chrysostom in Math. ho. 83.
You are so accustomed to belie the ancient writers: that you can not both
cite their words aright, and English them truly, in any one place that I can
yet meet withal. Chrysostom has not spoken any one word of Leven in that
place which you cite. Et nos in vnam cum illo massam reducimur. And we are
brought into one lump of Dough with him, being one body of Christ and one
flesh. Here is no mention of Leven, neither of meal of many grains and
water. Which you say Chrysostom makes a similitude of, to prove our unity in
one body. And this is also to be noted. That when you are come to, Christi
corpus vnum and vnae caro, one body of Christ and one flesh: you pass over
twice so much matter as you have cited, and then in English you go on with
these words. For by this mystery. etc. as though there had been no word at al
betwixt. And to enure your self with your accustomed feats: you translate the
words of the later sentence far otherwise then they signify in Latin. For
where Chrysostom does in Latin say thus. Sed ipse studiosissime alit: But he
himself does most diligently and carefully nourishe them: you have said thus:
But he himself, most diligently and lovingly, does feed them with himself.
Thus you do, as one either past shame, or assured that no man should at any
time examine your words, and charge you with your subtle dealing.

But now you have won the victory: let my masters of the new learning
(say you) tell me. etc. Your masters of the new learning as it pleases you to
term us: need not to use either figuratyue speeches or hyperbolies, to prove
that these words of Chrysostom may be verified of bread and wine. For I am
sure there is not one amongst us, that is learned: but he will readily grant,
that Chrysostomes purpose in this place, was to set forth and commend unto us,
the exceeding greatness of the love of Christ toward his elected and chosen
Church and congregation. Who, as saint Paul says, being in the majesty of
God: spared not to abase himself, and to take on him, Philip. 2.
our base and miserable estate. And to this purpose has Chrysostom said. Et
nos in vnam cum illo massam reducimur And we are brought into one lump of
Dough with him. And again. Singulis enim fidelibus per hoc mysterium se
coniungit. He does by this mystery join himself to every faithful man and
woman. And in conclusion he says thus. Hac etiam re tibi persuadens carnem
illam tuam assumpsisse: tanta igitur charitate, atque honor affecti, non
torpeamus. Persuading thee also by this thing, that he has taken upon him that
very flesh of thine. Being therefore so greatly beloved and honored, let us
not be sluggardes.

Now let my masters that would be called of the old learning, tell me how
this place of Chrysostom can be rightly applied, to prove that our cowpling
together in Christ in the fellowship of members of one body, is the effect of
their sacrament of the altar. Let them take the speech to be in what kind
they will, either plain, figurative, or hyperbolicall.

But you have not yet done with Cyrill in this matter. He must now express by
a similitude of two waxes melted and mingled together, Cyrill. li. 10. Capit.
13. and li. 4. capit. 17.
this conjunction of us with Christ. A man might ask you, what this makes to
the purpose. You must prove that our knitting together into members of one
body, is the effect of the sacrament of the altar. But let us weigh his
words. He says thus. Quemadmodum si quis. etc. Like as if a man mingle. etc.
You have cyted the words of Cyrill very truly, but you have not coated the
place aright. For in the.17. Chapter of the tenth Book, are no such words to
be found, neither is there any such matter handled there. But in the.13.
Chapter of the same Book, the words that you cite are found. And in the.17.
of the fourth are found words to the same effect. Watsons old trick will
not be left.
But in the translating of these words. Communicationis corporis and sanguinis
Christi: You use one little piece of your common trick. For you say thus. By
the communion and receiving of the body and blood of Christ, where as the true
English of the words is thus. By the communicating of the body and blood of
Christ, which communicating is in the faithful believers of ye promise of God
made in Christ: though the same do never receive the sacrament of the body and
blood of christ.

If you would have looked in the last Chapter of the ninth book: Cyrill. li.
9. Capit. 45.
you should have seen what Cyrill means by this word Communicatio. His
words be these. Non erat possibile, aliter corruptibilem secundum naturam
hominem, mortem effugere, nisi primum adeptus gratiam, rursus particeps Dei
fieret, qui omnia per filium in spiritu viuificat. Carne ergo and sanguini
communicauit, id est, qui secundum naturam vita est, vnigenitus Dei Patris
filius, homo factus est, mediator Dei atque hominum, vt scribitur. Natura Deo
coniunctus, ex quo est, and hominibus rursus, vt homo etc. It was not possible
that man, which by nature is corruptible, should otherwise escape death, except
obtaining the first grace, he might again be made partaker of God, that does
in the spirit quicken all things by his son. He has therefore communicated
himself to flesh and blood, that is to say, the only begotten son of God
the father, which is by nature life, is become man the mediator of God and men,
as it is written, being by nature joined to God, of whom he has his being,
and again unto man, as he is man.

Thus it is manifest, how evil fauouredly, The accord of Cyrill and Watson.
the meaning of the ancient writers, does agree with your purpose in cyting
them in your Sermons. Cyrill speaks of the communion or fellowship that man
has with Christ, by his incarnation: and you cite him to prove the joining of
al christians into the fellowship of one body, by receiving the sacrament of the
altar, as you call it.

Now let us see what Hilarious has said in this matter. Hilarious in Psalm. 6.
His words (you say) are these. Per communionem sancti corporis. etc. By the
communion of his holy body. You note in the margent of your printed book, that
this sentence of Hilarie, is written in his Commentary upon the sixth Psalm.
When you can show us that Commentary, you shall have the words that you cite
answered. Saint Hierome says that Hilarie wrote only upon the first and
second Psalms, the..51. and so forth to the.62. and from the.118. to the last.
And in his printed works, we find but eight mo, whereof the sixth is none.
Wherefore I must think that the great, learned and godly Bishop that you
speak of: is your self or some other such as you are. But if it may be found
in some other part of Hilarious works: what shall it make for your purpose, since
these words may have a good sense, if we understand by the first Communion,
that which we have by the incarnation of our Savior Christ, and by the later,
that which we have one with another. For by the communion that we have with
Christ, we be placed in that communion that we have one with another. And so
do these words make nothing to prove, that our cowpling into one body in
Christ, is the effect of the sacrament of the altar.

But now that your store is well spent: you use your figure of Rhetoric to
blere the readers eye withal. In such plain matter as this, what need I
heap places, one above another? All the fathers are full of it. How full the
fathers that you speak of be, of this so plain matter, does (I trust)
sufficiently appear, in that which I have already written, in the answer to
that which you have as yet alleged in the proof of this matter.

Wherefore, seeing you have not as yet proved, neither shall hereafter be able
to prove, either by the words of the scripture, or of the ancient fathers,
that our knitting together into one body in Christ, is the effect of your
sacrament of the altar: it is no wickedness nor blasphemy at all, to ascribe
that effect to the efficient cause thereof, which is God the father, through
his son Jesus Christ, and the holy ghost. But now let us see, what other
effects you have.

WATSON. Division. 26.
Beside these effects gathered out of the new Testament there be also other
mentioned in the Psalms. Whereof one is, that this sacrament is an armor and
defense against the temptations of our ghostly enemy the Devil, as it is
written in the.22. Psalm. 22. Chrysostom. in Psalm. 22. Euthymi in Psalm. 22.
Psalm. Parasti in conspectu meo mensam aduersus eos qui tribulant me. Thou
have prepared in my sight a Table against them that trouble me.

By this Table (says Chrysostom upon this place) is understood that thing
that is consecrated upon the altar of our Lord: and Euthymius a Greek Author
says so also: Par hanc mensam intelligit altaris mensam, in qua caena mystica
illa iacet: by this table he understands the table of the altar, upon which
lies the mystical supper of Christ, which does arm and defend us against the
Devil, which sometimes craftily lays in wait for us, sometimes fiercely and
cruelly assaulteth us, that be fed at Christ's table.

Saint Cyprian teaches us the same lesson, saying: Quos excitamus and
exhortamur ad praelium non inermes and nudos relinquamus, sed protectione
sanguinis and corporis Christi muniamus: Cyprianus. li. 1 Epist. 2.
Those persons whom we provoke and exhort to fight against their enemies (be it
either the Devils our ghostly enemies, or the Devils limbs the persecutours of
Christ's church) let us not leave them naked and unarmed, but let us harness
and defend them with the protection of Christ's body and blood.

And a little after he says: Cum ad hoc fiat Eucharistia, vt possit
accipientibus esse tutela, quos tutos esse contra aduersarium volumus,
munimento dominicae saturitatis armemus. Seeing this sacrament is ordained for
this purpose, that it should be a defense to the receyuers, let us arm them
with the shield and harness of our Lords meat, whom we would should be safe
against their adversary.

This is that food, that makes a man meet, Cyprian. li. 4. Epist. 6.
Cyprian. li. 2. Epist. 3.
and prepares him to martyrdom. This blood of Christ is dronken daily of us,
that we might in his quarrel shed our blood again: and as he writes in an
other place: how can we shed our blood for Christ, that be ashamed to drink
Christ's blood?

This blood being received of us (as Chrysostom says) drives the Devils
away, Chrysostom. in Joan hom. 45.
and does allure the Angels and the Lord of Angels unto us: for after the
meat of our Lord received, he forsakes us, Chrysostom ad Neophytos.
and flies away swifter then any wind, and dare not approach near, because
all entrance for his temptations is shut up. As saint Ambrose writes. Ambrose
in Psalm. 118. Ser. 8.
Cum hospitium tuum aduersarius viderit occupatum coelestis fulgore
praesentiae, intelligis locum tentamentis suis interclusum esse per Christum,
fugiet ac recedet. etc. When thy adversary shall see thy house and lodging (of
body and soul) occupied with the brightness of Christ's heavenly presence,
perceiving every place to be shut up from his temptations: he will fly and
run away.

Nazian in Iulianum orat. 2.
Wherefore as Gregory Nazianzene writes: Mensa hac praeparatur contra
tribulantes me qua omnem passionum rebellionem sca^. This table is prepared of
God against them that vex and trouble me, by the which I quench and pacify
all rebellion of my naughty affections.

Cyrillus li. 4. cap. 17.
And as Cyrill says) Non mortem solum, sed etiam morbos omnes depellit, sed at
saeuientem membrorum legem, pietatem coroboat, perturbationes animi extinguit,
nec in quibus sumus peccatis considerat, aegrotos curat, collisos redintegrat,
at omninos casu erigit. It dryueth away not only death, but also all
sickness, it stilleth and pacifieth the raging law of our members, it
strengthens devotion, it quenches the froward affections of the mind, and
those small sins we be in, it regards not, it heals the sick, it
restores the bruised and from all falling it lyfteth us up.

O what wonderful effects be these, which by this blessed Sacrament be
wrought in the worthy receyuer, against the Devil and his temptations, against
the flesh and her illusions, against the vicious affections of our corrupt
mind? What conscience had these men, our late teachers and pastors, destroyers
of Christ's flock, to rob us of this treasure, which is the cause of so great
benefits, and in the place of that, to plant amongs us a bare ceremony of bread
and wine to put us in remembrance of Christ in heaven (as they said) which
neither by their own nature, nor yet by any institution either of God or man,
be able to bring to pass in us these effects I have spoken of. What meant they
that took away this armor of Christ's flesh and blood from us, but to leave
us naked and unarmed against the Devil, that he should prevail against us in
all temptations, and that the kingdom of sin should be erected, and the
kingdom of grace destroyed? and to teach that this blessed Sacrament is
nothing else, but bread and wine, what is it else but to take away this armor
and harness of Christ's flesh and blood from us. For bread be it never so
much appointed to signify things absent, is not able to defend us from the
Devil.

After you have bustled about the effects of your sacrament, CROWLEY.
gathered out of the new testament: you make no small ado, about one other
effect, mentioned in the Psalm.22. Parasti in conspectu meo. etc. Thou have
prepared in my sight. etc. This effect, you say, is, that this armor and
defense. etc. And when this assertion of yours shall be well weighed: you shall
be found to hold, that this sacrament is the efficient cause, and the effect
both. And so must it be both before and after it self. For every efficient
cause, must needs be before the effect that proceeds from it: and every
effect must needs follow the efficient cause that is the worker of it.

But let us see how handsomely you apply this piece of this Psalm. Saint
Hierome says, that the Prophet means by the table that he speaks of here,
the scripture, wherein is found meat meet for such as are past their infansie
in Christ, and need not any longer to be fed with milk. His words be these.
Parasti in conspectu meo mensam. etc. Vt iam non lacte quasi paruulus alar, sed
solido cibo: id est, vt spirituali dente ruminans scripturas sanctas, possim
peruersis resistere. Thou have prepared a table. etc. Hieronymus in Psalm. 22.
That I should not now be nourished with milk like a little child, but with
sound meat: that is, that cudding the holy scriptures with a spiritual
tooth, I might be able to resist the froward. And again he says. Parasti in
conspectu meo mensam, aduersus eos qui tribulant me. Mensa id est scriptura
diuina. Sicut post laborem, in mensa inuenitur consolatio and refectio: sic and
sancti per mensam, id est, per scripturam diuinam, habent consolationem and
refectionem, id est, spem, fidem, and charitatem. Aduersus eos qui tribulant
me. Persecutores Ecclesiae: qui sunt Demones, Iudaei, and haeretici. Contra
istos omnes in scripturis sacris, inuenimus consolationem. Thou have prepared a
table in my presence: against those that trouble me. A table, that is, the holy
scripture. Even as after labor, there is found on the table, comfort and
refection: so also, the holy men, have by the means of the table, that is, the
holy scripture, consolation and refection, that is to say, hope, faith and
charity, against those that trouble me. The persecutors of the Church, which
are Devils, Jews, and Heretics. We do in the holy scriptures, find
consolation and comfort, against al these,

Saint Austen says thus. Parasti in conspectu meo, mensam, vt iam non lacte
alar paruulus: August in Psalm. 22.
sed maiorem cibum sumam, firmatus aduersus eos qui tribulant me. Thou have in
my presence prepared a table, that I should not now be nourished with milk as
a little child: but that being made strong against them that trouble me, I may
receive greater meat.

Lyranus, a man of your own sort, in many points: does first expound this
verse after the letter, Nicol. De Lyra in Psalm. 22.
saying thus. Parasti in conspectu meo mensam, id est, Victum sufficientem.
Aduersus eos. etc. Silicet Saul and eius accomplices. Thou have prepared a table
in my presence, against those. etc. That is to say, Saul and his accomplices.
And morally he says it may be expounded thus: Parasti in conspectu meo mensam:
id est, refectiuam consolationem. Aduersus eos qui tribulant me: id est,
aduersus Demones tentationibus suis, and malos homines, iniurijs me
tribulantes. In my presence, thou have prepared a table: that is, a refreshing
consolation. Against them that trouble me: that is against Devils which trouble
me with their temptations, and evil men with injuries.

This man was a Jew borne: and therefore, by all likelyhoode, had seen as
much of the Hebrew tongue, as any of his time. Which caused him, first to
expound the Psalm after the letter, as the Prophet David meant of himself,
whom God did not suffer to lack necessary food: no not in the time of his
exile by the means of the cruelty of king Saul. And notwithstanding he lived
within these three. C. years last past (which was a time of all ignorance and
blindness) yet could he not once dream of such a meaning, as you would make
the world believe, that the Prophet had when he wrote this Psalm.

Chrysostom in Psalm. 22.
But you have found Chrysostom a man of great learning and aucthority. Who
writing upon this part of this Psalm, says thus. Parasti in conspectu meo
mensam, aduersus cos. etc. Ista mensa, agnoscitur altaris Domini consecratio.
Thou have made ready a table. etc. This table is acknowledged to be the
consecration of the Lords altar. But you English it thus. By this table is
understood that thing, that is consecrated upon the altar of our Lord. In
which translation two things may be noted. First, that you use the word
consecration so, that it may seem that Chrysostom meant of such breathing out
of consecrating words, upon bread and wine: as you do use in your popish
Mass. And the other thing is, that you add to Chrysostomes words, the
Pronowne nostri. And where he says Domini, of the Lord: you would have men
think, that he says Domini nostri: of our Lord. And this is the common manner
of al your sort in these days (I mean English Papists) you can not abide
that consecration, should be understood of any other thing, then that
magical manner of breathing out words upon creatures. Nor that he which has
made all things, and therefore is Lord of all: should be called the Lord,
which does signify that he is not only Lord of one sort of people: but of
all nations also, and of all creatures.

But what help may you have by the words of Chrysostom? does he not within a
few lines after, write thus? Et quia istam mensam praeparauit seruis and
ancillis in conspectu eorum, vt quotidie in similitudinem corporis and
sanguinis Christi, panem and vinum secundum ordinem Melchisedech, nobis
ostenderet in sacramento: ideo dicit: Parasti in conspectu meo mensam, aduersus
eos qui tribulant me. And because he has made ready for his men servants and
women servants, this table in their presence, yt in the sacrament he might
daily show unto us bread and wine, to be a similitude or likeness of the body
and blood of Christ after the order of Melchesedech: he does say, you have
prepared a table in my sight, against them that trouble me.

Now, if you will needs urge the words that you cite for your purpose (which
notwithstanding, make nothing for you) I pray you be not displeased, if I urge
these words, which are very plain to prove, that in the sacrament are both
bread and wine, Watsons sentence turned against himself.
and that the same is appointed to be a similitude of the body and blood of
Christ. And so shall your own sentence be turned to your self. Which is that
it is great wickedness, and plain blasphemy to ascribe this glorious effect
to the needy elements of this world, as to bread and wine.

But now, I trow you have found a witness, that will not be so sone
disproued. Euthymius, a Greek Author says so also. A man might ask you, why
Chrysostom might not have been called a Greek author, as well as Euthymius.
But your purpose was (as I suppose) to make the world believe that Euthymius,
is as ancient as Chrysostom. And therefore you couple them together,
presupposing that all the learned do know, that Chrysostom wrote in Greek.
But when the antiquity of Euthymius shall be searched: he shall be found
younger then Chrysostom by eight hundred years. For the one lived about the
year of our Lord four hundred. And the other in the days of Alexius,
Emperor of the East, about the year of our Lord. 1200. He is not yet four
hundred years old. You did well therefore to thrust him in betwixt Chrysostom
and Cyprian: that he might at the first sight seem as ancient as they.

But what has he said? He says (say you) Per hanc mensam intelligit. etc.
He understands. etc. As though the Prophet David had understood nothing
else by this word table: but the table of the altar, whereupon the mystical
supper does lie. But surely (M. Watson) I can not wonder enough at your saucy
malapartnesse, Watson is saucy and malapart.
which has moved you to make your witness, being a Greek, to speak that by
your mouth and Pen in English: which he himself would never write in Greek.
You have said in his name, that the mystical supper does arm and defend us
against the Devil which sometimes craftily lays in wait for us. etc. All this you make Euthymius to speak in English more then he wrote in Greek. You
might as well have spared those words that were none of his, and have cited
all his words that he wrote upon the verse of the Psalm. 22. Parasti. etc.

In the Latin translation, whereout you cite your sentence, speaking first in
the person of the Prophet David, Euthymi in Psalm. 22.
he says. Non solum vt praedixi, me beneficijs affecisti: sed and spiritualia
etiam oblectamenta donasti, quae per mensam hic significantur. Hanc autem in
conspectu, inquit, inimicorum meorum parasti, vt videntes, dolor tabescerent:
vel aduersus eos, hoc est, contra id quod cupiant. Illi enim merore me semper
ac tristitia magis afficere student. Vel per mensam, futurorum bonorum
fruitionem intelligit, quam praeparauit Deus diligentibus se: vel altaris,
mensam, in qua caena mystica illa iacet, vel etiam virtutem moralem. As I have
said before (says David) thou have not only endued me with benefits: but
thou have also rewarded me with spiritual pleasures, which are here signified
by the table. And this table (says he) have thou prepared, in the presence of
mine enemies, that when they see it, they may be sorrowful, and even waste
away with sorrow. Or else against them: that is contrary to that which they
do desire or would wish: For they do always endeavor, rather to make me
sorrowful and heavy: Or else he does understand by the table, the fruition of
those good things to come, which God has prepared for them that love him: or
the table of the altar, whereon that mystical supper does lie, or else he
does understand by it moral virtue.

If it had pleased you to have cyted all these words: your witness should
have appeered a far more honest man then you. And some of your faithful
hearers (whose credit you would not by your curiosity seem to mistrust)
would surely have said that you had produced a witness against your self.
Watson has produced a witness against himself.
For what one word is there in all this (beside that little piece that you
have picked out) yt can be wrested to have any show to serve your purpose? And
these words also, as they stand in the Authors writing: can no more serve your
purpose then the rest. For how does he use them otherwise then to show that
sense among ye rest to be an Anagogicall sense? And if we may be allowed, to
allege scriptures for our purposes in that sense, and let pass both the
litterall and moral senses (as you do here) then let us as the common saying
is: facere quidlibet ex quolibet, make what we lust of every thing, as
commonly men of your sort use to do.

But now what does Cyprian say to this matter? He does teach us the same
lesson (say you) Quos excitamus. etc. Those persons. etc. You have so disordred
the words of Cyprian to frame them for your purpose: that they can not
otherwise be brought into order again, then by cyting wholly together, all that
which you have disordred, with the rest that you leave out, as not appertayning
to your purpose. Cyprian has said thus: Merito enim trahebatur dolentium
paenitentia tempore longiore, vt infirmis, si qui essent, in exitu
subueniretur. etc. The repentance of such as sorowed for their fall, was for
good cause continued for longer time, that if any of them should fall sick, we
might succor them in their departing out of this life: so long as we had
tranquillity and quiet, which would suffer us to defer the tears of the
sorrowful long time, and at the last succor them in their infirmity, when
they should lie in dying. But now, peace is needful, not for them that be
sick, but for such as be strong. And we must give the communion, not to them
that be at the point of death, but to them that live: that we do not leave
those unarmed and naked, whom we stir up and exhort to battle, but that we
arm them with the protection of the blood and body of Christ. And seeing the
Eucharist or thankesgyuing, is made for this purpose, that it may be a defense
to such as receive it, let us arm with the defense of the Lords full feeding,
such as we would wish should be safe against the enemy. For how do we teach
and provoke them to shed their own blood in the confession of the name of
Christ: if we do deny to give his blood in them that must fight? Or how do
we make them meet for the cup of martyrdom: if we do not first admit them,
in the Church to drink the cup of the Lord in the right of communion.

Here are Cyprians words, in such sort as he wrote them. And the occasion that
he had to write thus: was the evil opinion, that Cornelius then Bishop of
Rome, had conceived of Cyprian and other Bishops, for that they had received to
communion, such as had before fallen, in yielding to the persecutours, by
reason of the cruelty of torments used upon them.

To this does Cyprian and the other Bishops to the number of.39. answer in
this Epistle. Showing (as is before written) that it were not meet, that such
as through frailty have fallen, and do with bitter tears lament their fall:
should when persecution is threatened and like to come, be driven from the
Lords table, and not suffered to be partakers of that sacrament, that our Lord
Jesus has instituted to be an outward assurance of that which he has
promised in his word. For what reason were it, to persuade men to stand
manfully to the profession of Christ, and warant them everlasting life, if they
suffer loss of this life for his sake: and yet deny to give them the holy
communion, which Christ has instituted to be a seal of that promise? The best
armor for Christians.
No armor can be so sure, and make a man so bold and courageous against his
enemy: as to be assured, that his quarrel is such, that if he die therein, he
shall not fail to live and reign in glorious triumph for ever. Cyprian
therefore, does very well in using these Metaphers: calling that sacrament
that was ordained to be an assurance of this everlasting triumph, by the names
of protection, defense, and saufegarde.

But to make Cyprian to seem whole upon your side: Watsons common practice.
you help the matter somewhat in translating his words, and thrusting in a
few words of your own (as you are wont to do) to cause your hearers and
readers to think, that no man is able to gain say that, which you have said.

Well, you have yet one other place of Cyprian, but you spare the Latin,
thinking it sufficient, to tell your hearers and readers, that Cyprian says
so. For no man may think that you dare belie, so holy a man as he was: Liars
have no credit.
But because I have taken you with lies more then once: I dare not trust your
report of Cyprian, neither will I suffer my readers to be deceived by it.

First you say: This blood of Christ is dronken daily. etc. His words in
Latin are these. Grauior nunc and ferocior pugna imminet, Cyprian li. 4.
Epist. 6.
ad quam fide incorrupta, and virtute robusta, parare se debent milites
Christi, consyderantes idcirco se quotidie Calicem sanguinis Christi bibere: vt
possint and ipsi propter Christum, sanguinem fundere. A more grievous and
cruel battle, is now at hand: unto which, the Soldiers of Christ, ought
with vncorrupt faith and sloute courage, to prepare themselves, considering
that they do daily drink the cup of Christ's blood, to the end that they
themselves might be able to shed their own blood for Christ's cause.

In the other place that you cite, Cyprian says thus. Cyprian li. 2. Epist. 3.
Quomodo autem possumus propter Christum sanguinem fundere: qui sanguinem
Christi erubescimus bibere? How can we that be ashamed to drink the blood of
Christ: be able to shed our blood for Christ's cause?

In the first of these two places, saint Cyprians words are plain enough. For
he says that the daily receiving of the cup of Christ's blood, was to make
them able to shed their own blood for Christ's cause. That is, that being
daily put in remembrance of the shedding of Christ's blood for their sins,
and assured of the crown of martyrdom if theirs should be shed for his sake:
they might be encouraged, strengthened, and made able, to stand to their
profession, even to the shedding of their own blood for his sake, that spared
not to give his own heart blood for the redemption of their sins.

Ephesians. 6.
As for the armor that christian soldiers should buckle about them, Cyprian
appoints none, but the same that saint Paul appoints. And after he has
spoken thereof, he says thus. Haec arma sumamus, his nos tutamentis
spiritualibus and caelestibus muniamus: vt in die nequissimo resistere Diaboli
minis and repugnare possimus. Induamur loricam iustitiae. etc. Let us take unto
us this armor, let us defend our selves with these spiritual and heavenly
safegards: that in the most evil day we may be able to resist the threatenings
of the Devil, and fight against him. Let us put upon us the breast plate of
righteousness. etc.

This place of Cyprian therefore, can not be wrested to prove that the sacrament
of the altar, is any part of that armor that a christian must have, to be
able to stand against his enemies, either bodily or ghostly. But by the often
receiving of the sacrament worthily: the Christian heart is stirred up, more
carefully to cover himself with that armor that saint Paul has prescribed,
and to stand more manfully against all his mortal enemies.

Watson will not see.
But I marvel that you could not see, that in this place, saint Cyprian is
plain against your private Mass, and communion in one kind only. But you
lusted not to look on that side.

In the other place, he inueigheth against such as would have no wine in the
ministration, but water only. To those he says. Quomodo autem possumus. etc.
How can we shed our blood for Christ's cause: seeing we be ashamed to drink
Christ's blood? He had said before in the same Epistle. Nam cum dicat
Christus, Ego sum vitis vera: sanguis Christi, non aqua est vtique, sed vinum.
Nec po^est videri sanguis eius. etc. For seeing that Christ says, I am a Vine
in deed: the blood of Christ is not water, but wine. Neither can it seem that
his blood, wherewith we were redeemed and made ^lyue, is in the cup: when there
is no wine in the cup, whereby the blood of Christ is resembled. etc. Conferring
the places together, we can not but see, that Cyprian meant nothing less, then
to prove your assertion, and that his words cannot be wrested to prove that the
sacrament of the altar, is an armor and defense against the temptations of
our ghostly enemy the Devil.

Yet once again Chrysostom must help in this matter. Chrysostom. in Ioh. hom.
45.
He has said (say you) This blood being received of us. etc. In the place
that you note in the margent, he says thus. Hic mysticus Languis Demones
procul pellit. Angelos, and angelorum Dominum ad nos ^llicit. This mystical
blood, does drive Devils far away: and it does allure unto us, the Angels,
and the Lord of Angels. Yea he adds thus much more. Daemones enim, cum
dominicum sanguinem in nobis vident: in fugam vertuntur. Angeli autem
procurrunt. When the Devils do see the Lords blood in us: they run away.
And the Angels do with speed, run to us from far. Here I must tell you
of your old trick. Where Chrysostom says. This mystical blood, drives away
Devils. etc. you say, This blood being received of us. etc. Chrysostom
calls it mystical blood, and he says that when the Devils do see it in us,
that is to say, when they see our whole man besprinckled and washed with it:
they fly away. He says also, that when this blood is poured out, it does
wash and make clean the whole circle of the earth. Yea, he says yet further:
That from the Lords table, there issues a Fountain, that spreads out
abroad spiritual rivers, and that there be no barraine Willowes growning near
unto that Fountain: but Oaks that reach up to heaven, and do always bring
forth seasonable and sound fruits.

A man would think that a Doctor of Divinity (that had read this homily,
The title of Doctor disceyueth many.
and were acquainted with such figures as Chrysostom does commonly use, when
he takes in hand to set forth the excellency of any thing, and to show the
exceeding greatness of the virtue that is in the thing that he takes in
hand) could not for shame pick out such a piece as you have, to prove your
purpose withal. Yea, a man might maruayle at your beastly blindness, that will
not let you see, that this place of Chrysostom makes manifestly, both against
your private Mass, and against your Easter Housell (as you call it) under one
kind only, which is not the blood whereof Chrysostom speaks here, but the
bread, whereof he does in this place make no mention.

The exceeding great virtue, that this blood that Chrysostom speaks of,
has: is such, that no man can be able, either with tongue or pen to declare it
at the full. And therefore does he use so many Hyperbolicall speeches, and
calls it mystical blood. And so many as be sprinkled with this blood (that
is, as many as being elected in Christ, be called by the preaching of the
Gospel, and do obey the caller) may, when they fall into temptation, assure
themselves, that the tempter will when he sees them be sprinkled and washed
with this blood: fly from them, as Chrysostom says here.

Chrysostom. ad Neophytos.
And as in the other place that you cite out of the same Chrysostom, he says:
when such one comes out from the Lords feast, the enemy flies from him,
more swiftly then any wind. And when that cruel enemy, shall see the tongue
of such one, embrued with this blood. That is, that no word foundeth out of
his mouth, but such as are to the setting forth of the glory of him that shed
this blood: believe me (says Chrysostom) he will not tarry. etc. And this
place also makes manifestly against your private Mass and half housell, and
nothing at all for your purpose.

But here I must by the way tell you of your subtlety, in tying certain
words of your own to the end of that which you cite out of Chrysostom in
such sort, that they may seem to be Chrysostomes words. And then you labor
to confirm them by the words of Ambrose, who says thus. Cum hospitium. etc.
When thine adversary shall see. Ambros. in Psalm. 118. sermon. 8.
etc. According to your old manner of translating into English: you thrust in
(body and soul) of your own, and so do ye (every place) and would have men
think, that you mean well and truly. But let us see what may be said to
these words of Ambrose. First I must let the Reader see, a few words that go
before those that you cite, so shall he be the better able to judge whether you
have dealt uprightly in alleging them for your purpose, or no. He writes
thus. Suscipe ante Dominum Iesum tuae mentis hospitio. Vbi Corpus eius, ibi
Christus: est. Cum hospitium tuum aduersarius viderat occupatum caelestis
fulgore praesentiae, intelligens locum tentamentis suis interclusum esse per
Christum fugiet ac recedet. Receive before hand, the Lord Jesus into the
harbor of thy mind. Christ is there, where his body is. When the enemy shall
perceive that the brightness of the heavenly presence, does possess thy
lodging, and understand that Christ has enclosed the place from his
temptations, he will fly and depart away.

Ambrose does here teach us to receive Christ. First, spiritually into our
minds by faith: and then sacramentally in the congregation. The scripture that
gave him occasion to write thus, is the sixth verse of the eight part of
the.118. Psalm, after the account of the.70. The words of the verse are
these. At midnight did I arise to praise thee. etc. By occasion of these words
Ambrose does earnestly exhort all Christians to give themselves to meditation
both night and day: but specially at such time as public fasting should be
appointed. The days were then troublesome, and christians were well most
continually persecuted. Wherefore, they did often at the appointment of their
Pastors, The right use of fasting.
abstain from all manner of bodily sustenaunce, and from sleep, and gave
themselves to prayer in the congregation, and did communicate. So assuring,
even their senses, that though they should fall into the persecutors hands:
yet should there no harm happen unto them. For they were surely cowpled unto
Christ, and one to another. So that though they should seem to the world to
perish: yet they were in deed, delivered from misery, and received into
endless felicity. And for this cause does Ambrose call this sacrament
Munimentum. A defense. For by it, we be thoroughly certified of the forgiveness
of our sins, and that we are reconciled and received into favor with God
again.

This is not to teach, that after the receiving of the sacrament of the altar
(as you term it) the Devil can find no way to enter into the receiver: but
that when we have received Christ by faith, and do declare the same by
communicating with the rest of Christ's members: then may we assure our selves,
that there is no way for the enemy to enter. And therefore, he will fly away,
and as saint Ambrose says, depart from us. For Christ is in possession, and
none is able to remove him.

But I must still maruayle that you see not, that all these whom ye allege:
do fight against you for your private Massing. And that this Ambrose does give
you warning, that if you will be defended against the Devil, and have him shut
out: you must first receive Christ into the harbor of your mind, Christ must
be in ye mind before the sacrament come in the mouth.
which is by faith. For Ambrose knew, that if Christ were not in possession of
the mind, before the sacrament came into the mouth: the receiving should be to
condempnation. And then it does not shut out the Devil: but make an open way
for him to enter.

But now let us see what Nazianzen has said. You say, that his words be
thus. Mensa haec. etc. This table, and so forth, as is before. Because the
reader shall not need to seek the words that you have left out, in the
works of Gregory (which are not in every man's study) I will write so much of
his saying as may make his meaning known. And if any shall doubt of my
faithful dealing therein: let the same search the place and be satisfied. His
words are these: Sane, and vnguentum quoddam habeo, sed quo solum Reges and
sacerdotes vtuntur, varium and preciosum, ac pro nobis euacuatum, magni
vnguentarij opificio compositum. Vtinam mihi contingat vnguenti huius odorem
bonum apponere Deo. Habeo and mensam, spiritalem illam and deuinam, quam mihi
praeparauit Dominus contra tribulantes me. Vel in qua requiesco and delicijs
fruor, and nequaquam propter sacietatem iniuriam committo, sed and omnem
passionum rebellionem sedo etc. I have a little sweet ointment also (but yet
such as being of many ointments mixed together and costly, and drawn out for
us, it annoynteth only kings and priests) which was made by the workmanship of
an excellent vnguentary. Would God it might be my lot to pour out unto God, a
sweet savor of this ointment. I have also, this spiritual and heavenly
table, which the Lord has prepared for me, over against them that trouble me,
or in which I do rest, and delight my self, and do nothing offend by reason
of sacietie or fullness, but I do also suppress all rebellion of affections.

Now let the learned reader judge, how well you deserve to be credited another
time when you cite any thing out of the ancient fathers. Gregory has said.
Or in which I do rest and delight my self, and do nothing offend, by reason
of sacietie or fullness. But you thought good, not to trouble your hearers with
any of those words: least they should see that Gregory and you be of two
minds. You make your tale smooth and whole, as though you had not lept over
any of Gregory's words. For thus you say. This table is prepared of God,
against them that vex and trouble me, Crafty handling of the fathers sayings.
by which I quench and pacify al rebellion of my naughty affections. Who
would think that there were any word left out? So craftily can you handle the
words of ancient fathers, to make them seem to serve your purpose.

But when the words of Gregory, are considered wholly together, and conferred
with that which goes before and follows after: it shall appeete that
Gregory's meaning was to declare in what points, the acceptable exercise of
Christian religion does consist and stand. In pureness of soul, and
cheerfulness of mind: not in bodily mirth, gorgious apparel, eating and
drinking and wantonness. Not in furnishing of houses and doors, with flowers,
nor burning of lights, nor playing upon Instruments. etc. For such was the
order of the heathenish solemnity. He would have such Lamps as might light the
whole body of Christ's Church, and the whole world. And he says, that he
means the holy word of God thereby. In comparison of this light, says he: I
esteem not much of all those lights that men use in the solemnization of
their feasts. And then follow those words that I have before written. And
immediately after those words, he says. I have also a field (which the Lord
has blessed) full of flowers, more flourishing and more durable, then any
flowers that grow in the spring time. I mean (says he) the Priests, and
sweet savoring shepherds and teachers: and a people, though it be but small
in number, yet pure, chosen out, and picked. etc.

Now (M. Watson) how say you by your Nazianzen? will you have him to allow
your private Masses with their effects? your Tapers and Torchlight, your
ringing and singing with blowing of Organs? Your masking, mumming, and dumb
Idol Priests, that can do nothing else but sing and say their service in an
unknown tongue? etc. No, no, all wise men may see, that he is of a far other
mind.

Now let us see what Cyrillus will say to this matter. He says (say you) Non
mortem solum. etc. Not only death. etc. If I did not know your old manner in
falsifiyng the sayings of ancient fathers: I could never maruayle enough at
your beastly blindness, in cyting this place for your purpose. You would have
Cyrill to bear you record, that the sacrament of the altar, is an armor and
defense, against the temptations of our ghostly enemy. etc. To make his words
more plain to the reader: I will let him see in writing a few of those words
that go before, that which you cite. First, he speaks in the person of him
that doubts of having any commodity, by the receiving of the sacrament of
Christ's body and blood: because saint Paul has said, that whosoever shall
eat the bread, and drink the cup unworthily, shall eat and drink his own
condemnation. And I (says such one) do examine my self, and find my self
unworthy. When therefore (says Cyrill) will thou (whosoever thou art that
speak these words) be worthy? When will thou offer thy self to Christ? For
if thou be unworthy because thou do sin, and thou leauest not of sinning
(for who does understand his own sin, as says the Psalmist) then shall
thou be utterly without any part of this sanctification. To this he answers
thus. Quare pias quaeso cogitationes suscipias, studiose sancteque vinas, and
benedictione participes, quae (mihi creed) non mortem solum, verum etiam morbos
omnes depellit. Sedat enim cum in nobis maneat Christus: seuientem membrorum
nostrorum legem, pietatem corroborat, perturbationes animi extinguit, nec in
quibus sumus peccatis consyderat: sed aegrotos curat, collisos redintegrat, and
sicut pastor bonus, qui animam suam pro omnibus posuit, ab omni nos erigit
casu. I pray thee therefore take in hand godly cogitations. See that thou do
live studiously and holyly, and thou may be partaker of the benediction.
Which (believe me) does not only drive away death, but all sicknesses and
diseases also. For when Christ dwells in us he does still the raging law of
our members, he does confirm and strenthen godly devotion, he quenches ye
parturbations of the mind. Neither does he consider the sins wherein we are:
but he makes whole such as be sick, and them sound that be broken. And as a
good shepherd that has given his life for his sheep: he does lift us up, as
often as we fall.

If a man should ask Cyrill, what it is that drives away death and diseases,
he would say, the benediction or sanctification, that is Christ. For (as saint
Paul says) he is our sanctification. 1. Cor. 1.
And that sinner that follows Cyrilles counsel, needs not to doubt of
sanctification by Christ, and consequently, he needs not to fear to be
partaker of that sacrament that was instituted to confirm and strengthen us in
the belief of our sanctification in him. And if a man should ask him, who it
is that stylleth the raging law of our members. etc. He would answer yt it is
Christ.

But if a man should bid you make your reason perfect, by putting to so many
Verbes one Nominative case, at the least (for it is a very imperfect oration
wherein there is no Nominative case, as Grammarians say) it is to be thought
that you must say, An oration without a Nameyng case.
that Sacramentum altaris, the sacrament of the altar is the Nominative case
to al those verbes. And then shall it appear how Cyrill and you do agree, and
how cleanly you have conveyed your matter.

But now you conclude your treatise upon this effect, with a marvelous
exclamation: wondering first at the strange effects that this sacrament has
brought forth, and then at the lardge conscience of your late teachers
(destroyers of Christ's flock, you say) which take away this armor, which was
none other thing but to leave you naked and unarmed against the Devil, that he
might prevail. etc.

All this labor you might have spared: Watso^ might have spared this labor.
if you would have opened your eyes to see the true meaning of those places of
scripture and ancient fathers that you cite for your purpose. For they neither
teach that these effects do spring out of the sacrament of the altar: nor
that your late teachers have robbed you of any treasure. For they did but take
from you such toys as your father the Pope had devised for you. Neither did
those teachers plant among you a bare Ceremony: for they restored again the
Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, which you and your sort, had so
disguised with your ceremonies, that it could not be known for any sacrament
of Christ. They taught not, that it is nothing else but bread and wine: but
they taught, and we do teach, that it is sacramental bread and wine, and that
being received by the member of Christ, it is the mystical body of Christ, and
works in him as much as our savior Christ did ordeyne it to work: That is,
the certifying of his weak nature: that everlasting life is purchased for him,
by the death and blood shedding of Christ: And that he is unseparably knit unto
Christ his head, and unto the rest of Gods chosen children. And this is not the
effect of bread and wine: But of him that works by his sacraments as by
instruments. But now you have one effect more, and so an end of this matter.

WATSON. Division. 27
Well: one other effect I shall note unto you, and make an end of that matter.

This effect is written in the next verse of the same Psalm. Et calix tuus
inebrians quam praeclarus est: Psalm. 22.
and thy Chalice or Cup that makes us drunk, how goodly and excellent is it?
There be two Cups, one worldly of wine, the other heavenly of Christ's blood:
both make men dronken, but after diverse sorts, the one is sometimes, the
instrument of sin, the other at al times the instrument of grace, for as much
as perteyneth to his own nature.

Of this writes S. Cyprian. Sed quia ebrietas dominici calicis and sanguinis
non est talis qualis est ebrietas vini secularis, Cyprian. li. 2. Epist. 3.
cum diceret spiritus sanctus in Psalmo. Calix tuus inebrians, addidit perquam
optimus: quod scilicet calix dominicus sic bibentes, inebriat, vt sobrios
faciat, vt mentes ad spiritalem sapientiam redigat, vt a sapore isto seculari,
ad imtellectum Dei vnusquisque resipiscat. But because the drunkenness of our
Lords cup and blood is not such, as the drunkenness of worldly wine: when the
holy ghost in the Psalm said. Thy cup that makes men drunk, (he added) is
very godly and excellent, because the cup of our Lord does so make the
drinkers drunk, that it makes them sober, that it brings their minds to
spiritual wisdom that every man may bring himself from this drowsinesse of
the world to the understanding and knowledge of God.

To this intent saint Ambrose writes in diverse places, Ambros. in Psalm. 1.
as upon the first Psalm. At vero Dominus Jesus aquam de petra effudit, and
omnes biberunt, and so forth. The place is long and for avoiding of
tediousness, I shall faithfully rehearse it in English. But our Lord Jesus
brought water out of the stone, and all drank of it. They that drank in
figure, were satiate, they that drunk in truth were made drunk, the
drunkenness is good, which brings in mirth and not confusion, that
drunkenness is good, that stays in soberness the motions of the mind.

And he speaks more playner in these words. Ambros. in Psalm. 118. sermon. 15.
Eat the meat of the Apostles preaching before, that thou may afterward come
to the meat of Christ, to the meat of our Lords body, to the deynties of
the sacrament, to that cup wherewithal the affection of the faithful is made
drunk that it might conceive gladness for remission of sin, and put away
the thoughts of this world, the fear of death and all troublesome
carfulness, for by this drunkenness that body does not stumble and fall but
rises (to grace and glory) the soul is not confounded, but is consecrate and
made holy.

Yet one effect more, and then an end of this matter. CROWLEY.
The drunkenness that the Prophet David speaks of in the.22. Psalm. etc.
Here you seem to have forgotten your self. Watson forgets what he has in
hand.
Your whole labor hitherto, has been to prove, that the sacrament of the
altar works many excellent effects: and so you have made it the efficient
cause of those effects. But now, as one that remembers not what you have in
hand: you say that it is the instrument of grace. If you will abide by that,
then I will not strive with you: for I am of the same mind that you are in
that point, if you have written as you thinck, when you say that it is the
instrument of grace. For even as the word of God is an instrument of grace: so
are the sacraments also. But God, whose word and sacraments they be: is the
efficient cause that works by them, as by instruments.

But it seems by that which you cite out of Cyprian and Ambrose, to prove
this effect that ye speak of: that it was but a slip of memory, when you
called it an instrument. I will therefore suppose that you be the same man that
you were before: till I see better lykelyhood of your sound judgment in this
matter. Cyprian has said (say you) Sed quia ebrietas. etc. Cyprian. li. 2.
Epist. 3.


According to your custom, you leave out those words that might make the
writers meaning plain. Cyprian had said before, that for as much as neither
the Apostle Paul, nor an Angel from heaven, might declare or teach any
otherwise, then Christ himself had once taught, and his Apostles had declared:
he marvelled, that contrary to the Evangelical, and Apostolical doctrine,
there was in some places water offered in the Lords cup, which could not of
it self alone, express the blood of the Lord. The sacrament whereof the holy
ghost does not pass over in the Psalms, making mention of the Lords cup and
saying: Thy cup, which does make drunk, is exceeding good. And the cup that
makes men drunk, is surely mixed with wine: for water can not make any man
dronken. And the Lords cup does make a man drunk, even as Noe was made droken
when he drank wine, as it is written in Genesis. And then do those words
that you have cyted, solow.

All indifferent readers may perceive by these words of Cyprian what his
meaning was. Not to teach, that the spiritual drunkenness, is the effect of
the sacrament: but that the sacrament might not be ministered with water alone
without wine. For unless it have in it, a natural strength to make the
drinkers dronken: it can not express, that is to say, it can not lively
represent the blood of Christ, which being dronken of such as be members of
his body, in spirit by faith, and sacramentally in the sacrament, according to
his institution: does make them dronken with that drunkenness that saint
Cyprian speaks of here. And to make his meaning more plain, he adds to the
end of those words that you have cyted, these plain and manifest words. Et
quemadmodum vino isto communi, men's soluitur, and anima relaxatur, and
tristitia omnis exponitur: ita and potato sanguine Domini, and poculo salutari,
exponatur memoria veteris hominis, and fiat obliuio conuersationis pristinae
secularis: and moestum pectus and triste, quod prius peccatis angentibus
praemebatur, diuinae indulgentiae laetitia resoluatur. Quod tunc demum potest
laetificare in Ecclesia Domini bibentem: si quod bibitur dominicam teneat
veritatem. And as by the drinking of this common wine, a man's mind is loosed,
and his soul set at lardge from all cares, and all sorowfulnesse is sent out
from the same: even so, when the Lords blood, and the cup of salvation is
dronken, the remembrance of the old man may be expelled, and the old worldly
conversation forgotten, and the sorrowful and pensive heart, which was before
oppressed with sorrow for sin: may be resolved by the joyful gladness of
forgiveness at Gods hand. Which cup may cheer him that drinks it in the
Church of the Lord, when the thing that is dronken, does hold the truth of the
Lord.

By these words of Cyprian, it is manifest that he means of such a
drunkenness as saint Austen does, August. in Psalm. 22.
writing upon the same verse of the.22. Psalm. Where he says thus. Et poculum
tuum, obliuionem praestans priorum vanarum delectationum, quam praeclarum est.
And thy cup, which does make men forget their former vain pleasures: is very
notable and excellent. And this is according to that which saint Paul writes
to the Ephesians saying. Be ye not dronken with wine, wherein is excess:
Ephesians. 5.
but be ye filled with the holy ghost. etc.

To help you to prove this effect: you cite Ambrose upon the first Psalm. And
to avoid tediousness, you will faithfully rehearse his words in English. etc.
It had been well, if to avoid tediousness, you would have left out all that
you do here cite out of Ambrose. Or else, that you had borrowed a little more
time with your Auditory: to make his meaning better known to them.

In the beginning of the matter that saint Ambrose does handle in the place
that you cite: Ambros. in Psalm. 1.
he says thus. Hoc primum bibe. Drink this cup first. And shortly after he
says thus. Prodest tibi cor habere contritum. Hoc primum bibe: vt sacrificium
tuum accipiatur a Domino. Doceat te Apostolus quid sit, (hoc primum bibe:) hoc
est tribulationis poculum. It is profitable for thee to have a contrite heart.
Drink this cup first, that the Lord may accept thy sacrifice. Let the Apostle
teach thee, what this saying (drink this cup first) does mean. It signifies
the cup of tribulation. And after a few words he says. Bibe primum, vt sitim
mitiges: Bibe secundum, vt saturitatem haureas. In veteri testamento
compunctio, in nouo laeticia est. Drink the first Testament, that thou may
mitigate thy thirst: drink the second, that thou may drink to the full. In
the old Testament there is hearty sorrow for sin, in the new Testament: joy
and gladness. And to avoid tediousness, let me faithfully rehearse in
English, the words that go immediately before those words that you cite. See
(says saint Ambrose) how the Lord has on the hehalfe of his servants:
matched the disceites of the Devil. He did with one morsel of meat disceyue
one man: that he might in one, circumuent all. But Jesus has redeemed all,
with the meat of salvation: that in all, he might reform him that had been
disceyued. The Devil did invent the golden Cup of Babylon, that such as should
drink thereof, might be more thirsty: and that because the drink could not
be pleasant, he might allure them with the price of the Gold. He began unto
them of his own wine, whereunto he sought to have the help of the metal. But
the Lord Jesus did pour water out of the rock, and so forth, as you have
cited. And to the end of those words that you cite: he adds these. Neither
let it move thee, that the Babilonion Cup is of Gold: for thou do drink
the Cup of wisdom, which is more precious then is Gold or Silver. Drink both
the Cups therefore, both the old and the new Teastament. For in each of them
thou do drink Christ. Drink Christ: because he is the wine. Drink Christ:
because he is the rock, that vometted out the water. Drink Christ: because he
is the Fountain of life. Drink Christ: because he is the river, the rushing
whereof does make glad the City of God. Drink Christ: because he is peace.
Drink Christ: because rivers of living water do flow out of his belly.
Drink Christ: that thou may drink the blood wherewith thou wast redeemed.
Drink Christ, that thou may drink his word. etc.

Now (M. Watson) if you have not drunk so deep of the Babilonicall cup, that
you be thereby fallen into the deadly slumber of Romish obstinacy: you must
needs see that Ambrose does not in this place mean to maintain your
assertion: That is, that the spiritual drunkenness, is the effect of the
sacrament of the altar. But here by the way I must put you in remembrance of
citing such places as fight against your private Masses and half Housels.

But you have yet another place, Ambros. in Psalm. 118. Ser. 15.
where Amborse speaks more plainly, and says. Eat the meat of the Apostles
preaching. etc. Ambrose wrote them thus in Latin. Dicit ad Discipulos, date
illis vos manducare: ne deficiant in via. Habes apostolicum cibum: manduca
illum, and non deficies. Illum ante manduca, vt postea venias ad cibum Christi,
ad cibum corporis dominici, ad epulas sacramenti, ad illud poculum quo fidelium
inebriatur affectus, vt laetitiam induat de remissione peccati, curas seculi
huius, metum mortis, solicitudinesque deponat. Hac ergo ebrietate, corpus non
titubat, sed resurgit: animus non confunditur, sed consecratur. He says to his
disciples. Do ye give them to eat, least they faint by the way. Thou have
the meat that the Apostles gave: eat that, and thou shall not faint. Eat
that meat first: that thou may afterward come to the meat of Christ, to the
meat of the Lords body, to the delicacies of the sacrament, to that cup
whereby the affection of the faithful is made dronken, that it may put on joy
for the remission of sin, and lay off the cares of this world, the fear of
death and troubles of mind. The body does not stumble with this drunkenness,
but it ryseth again, the mind is not confounded, but consecrated.

The meat that the Apostles did minister, Math. 28. Marc. 16.
was the word and the sacraments. For this was their commission. Ite in mundum.
etc. Go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to all creatures. etc. And
saint Paul says. Sic nos aestimet homo. etc. 1. Cor. 4.
Let a man so esteem us, as the ministers of Christ, and Stewards of Gods
mysteries. Wherefore Ambrose teaching us to eat the Apostolical meat first,
yt we may afterward come to the meat of Christ: can not mean of that meat
that is received, either by the ears or by the mouth, but by faith into the
heart and soul. Which is, as Ambrose says here, the delicacie of the
sacrament, and the cup that makes the affection of the faithful dronken. etc.
But see you not, how this place also, fights against your private Masses and
half communions? yea and against your manner of ministering sacraments, without
the preaching of the word before. But go forward with your matter.

WATSON. Division. 28
These scriptures, and these effects brought out of the scriptures, and
confirmed by many manifest authorities of the holy fathers, do prove evidently
to any man that has but common wit and any sparkle of grace, and is not
forsaken of almighty God, that the substance of this sacrament is neither
bread nor wine, but only the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, united
to Gods son in unity of person, which is a sufficient cause, able to work
in the worthy receauer these heavenly and glorious effects, which I have
spoken of already.

Whereby appears, what moves me to continue still in that faith, which is so
expressly taught in holy scripture: which scripture also draws and pulls me
from the contrary false opinion.

Math. 7.
In diverse places it moves me and all christen men to beware and take heed of
false Prophets, that come in the apparel of sheep, but within they be
ravenous Wolfes: that in their mouths have the word of God, the truth, the
Gospel and such gaye words, but the pit and effect of their teaching is
old rotten heresies, confuted and condemned of all Christendom before, and
not Gods word, the name whereof they abuse to the maintenance of all vice,
error, beastly living, adultery, disobedience, sacrilege, and open
conspiracy, to the subversion of themselves, and of that state under which
they live.

The scripture cries, Nolite omni spiritui credere, 1. John. 4.
believe not every spirit, but try and prove the spirits, if they be of God
or no, for many false Prophets are abroad in the world. One way to try them,
is to mark the end of their conversation, and the example and fruit of their
lives, as saint Paul says. Quorum exitum conuersationis intuentes, Hebr. 1.
eorum imitamini fidem: follow their faith, the end of whose conversation ye
have seen.

We have seen, what is the end of this new teaching, carnal and detestable
living, conspiracy and treason.

The other fathers of whom we learned our faith, were men whom the corrupt
world was not worthy to have: these Authors of this new opinion were men, that
were not worthy to have and enjoy the world: Pet. 28.
of whom saint Peter writes, Magistri mendaces, and so forth. Lying masters
that bring in sects of perdicion, and deny that Lord that bought them (as
they do in this matter of the sacrament) bringing upon them a speedy
perdition: and many shall follow their ways, through whom the way of truth
shall be slaundered and blasphemed, and in covetousness by feyned words they
shall make marchaundise of you, to whom judgment cease not, and their
destruction sleeps not.

We be also warned by saint John of this matter, saying: 2. John. 1.
he that remains and abides in the doctrine (that the Apostles taught) he
has the father and the son. If any come to you not bringing this doctrine,
do not receive him into your houses.

Here he does teach us to avoid them, that profess any other doctrine then
such as all faithful men universally thorowout the world have received and
profess, which is not the doctrine, that the Sacramentaries preach.

Finally considering the promises of Christ to his church that he will be with
them to the worlds end, Math. 28.
and that the holy ghost shall lead them into all truth, John. 16.
then may we justly say, that if this our faith be an error, it has prevailed
universally not one hundredth year, but two, three, four, yea a thousand
year, and more then that, even to the ascension of Christ, as appears by the
testimonies of all holy writers, and then may we say Lord if we be deceived,
thou have deceived us, we have believed thy word, we have followed the
tradition of the universal Church, we have obeyed the determinations and
teachings of those Bishops and Pastors, whom thou have placed in the Church to
stay us in unity of faith, that we be not carried away with every wind of
false doctrine. Therefore if we be deceived it comes of thee O Lord, our
error is invincible.

But good people, we are sure, God deceaueth no man, let us all beware we do
not deceive our selves, as Saint James says.

CROWLEY.
As touching the scriptures that you have alleged, and the effects that you
have affirmed, to be the effects of the sacrament: you are already sufficiently
answered. And for the substance of the sacrament also. We teach not that the
worthy receyuer, does receive none other thing but bread and wine: for we hold
(as the scriptures and the ancient fathers have taught) that the worthy
receiver does receive after a spiritual manner, and sacramentally, very Christ,
God and man, that bread of life that came down from heaven. But with S. Austen
we teach, that the unworthy receiver does not receive Panem Dominum: sed panem
Domini contra Dominum. August. in John. Tract. 59.
The bread which is the Lord: but the bread of the Lord against the Lord.

And where you cite certain scriptures, that warn you and all christians to
beware of false prophets. etc. you your self are one of those false Prophets.
And the Prelates of your Antichristian and Babilonicall Church of Rome: are
those ravening Woolfes that saint Paul did prophecy of, Act. 21.
that should not spare the flock. The hauock that you made of Christ's silly
Lambs in Queen Mary's days, 1. John. 4.
does declare what you are. Saint John does very well warn us, not to believe
every spirit: but to try whether they be of God or not. And shall we think
that your spirit is of God, which moves you to set up the Pope above all that
is called God (that is above all Princes, 2. These. 2.
which in the scripture are called Gods) and to maintain him in the temple of
God (that is in the Church of Christ, boasting himself as though he were God?
No surely, we can not think that your spirit is of God, for it is an arrogant
spirit.

And as for the way that you have found to try spirits by: let it be
considered. And if your spirit, may be by that trial found to be of Christ:
then will we credit you. But if ours be found so by the same: then why should
not you credit us. Mementote praepositorum vestrorum (says saint Paul) qui
vobis locuti sunt verbum Dei, quorum intuentes exitum conuersationis, imitamini
fidem. Hebr. 13.
Remember those that are your governors, and have spoken unto you the word of
God: and considering the end of their conversation, ye do imitate or follow
their faith.

Chrysostom writing upon this place says thus. In hoc loco, etiam de
adiutorio in fratres, eum existimo dicere: hoc enim est quod dicit. Qui vobis
locuti sunt verbum Dei: Quorum contemplantes exitum conuersationis, imitamini
fidem. Quid est contemplantes? Sepius animo versantes, and apud vosmetipsos
examinantes, consyderantes, subtiliter discutientes inquit, exitum
conuersationis. Hoc est perseuerantiam vsque in finem: quoniam finem bonum
habuit eorum conuersatio. etc. In this place (says Chrysostom) I suppose that
he speaks of the help that the brethren should have at their hands. This is
it that he means when he says, which have spoken the word of God to you,
the end of whose conversation when ye do behold, you follow their faith. What
means he when he says, when you do behold? He says as much as if he had
said. When you do toss it and tumble it in your minds, and do examine it
with your selves, considering and discussing it thoroughly. The end of their
conversation, that is, their perseueraunce to the end: because their
conversation had a good end. etc.

It is manifest, that Chrysostom: does understand saint Paul's purpose in
this place to be, chiefly to put the Hebrews in remembrance of their duties,
toward such as had preached the Gospel amongst them. Whose faith they did
imitate: because they had seen their constancy in contynuall preaching of
sound doctrine, Another shift that Watson uses.
leading a life according to the same. And here I must tell you, that you do
to much abuse Saint Paul, when you make the English reader believe, that
saint Paul speaks in the Imparatiue Mood, commanding the Hebrews to follow
the faith of those men, the end of whose conversation they had seen. For both
in the Greek and Latin, it is the Indicative Mood. You do follow. But grant
it be a mark whereby the soundness of faith may be known: What have you
won thereby? Shall there not as many of the Popes Clergy be found inconstaunt
in doctrine: as of the teachers of the new learning (as you term them)? I
need not to write any more of this matter. The world sees well enough, both
the constauncie and conversation of the most part of the teachers of your sort.

In deed (as Chrysostom says here) when men shall see that the Preachers of
any doctrine, do persevere and continue constaunt in that doctrine, and do
lead a life like unto the doctrine: it moves them that hear the doctrine, to
waighe and consider, both the life and the doctrine, and when they find that
both be sound, The fruit of constancy and good life in Preachers.
and without hypocrisy, to follow the faith of such preachers, as the Hebrews
did follow the faith of them that had constauntly preached the word amongst
them, and led a life according to the same. But if the doctrine, when it is
weighed, be found diverse and strange, and the conversation hypocritical, full
of will works, besides, yea and contrary to the commandment of God: then
the godly, wise, will leave those hypocrites and their faith, and seek for such
as shall preach unto them such doctrine as may be found perfect and sound. And
though the preachers of that doctrine do in some points, show themselves to
be men: yet will they not reject the sound doctrine, for the lack of sound
life in the preacher.

But you bend these words of Paul another way: and you say that you have
seen the end of this new learning. It is (say you) carnal and detestable
living, conspiracy and treason. Me thinks, I could guess, where you learned
to call the life of those teachers that you name new: carnal and beastly. For
it was the manner of your old master Stephane Gardener: so to term the life
of married ministers. So beastly was he, and so beastly do you seem to be (for
that is the carnal and beastly life that you mean, I am sure) as to account
that thing beastly, which is the holy ordinance of God. Saint Paul, even in
the same chapter that you do cite has said. Honorabile est coniugium in
omnibus, Hebr. 13.
and thorus immaculatus. Marriage is honorable amongst al men: and the bed
thereof undefiled. It is to much therefore to call it beastly in ministers, for
they be men also, and therefore their wedlock is honorable. As for your
wyfelesse Priesthood, the world has seen and perceived well enough, and as
saint Paul writes to the Ephesians. Quae enim in occulto fiune ab ipsis,
turpe est and dicere: Ephesians. 5.
It is a filthye thing, once to name those things that these men do in secret.

As for your conspiracy and treason that you charge us with: I refer to the
judgment of such as have read the Chronicles and histories of the practices
of Popish Prelates. And I pray you (M. Watson) even in the days that you have
lived: who have been the conspirators and Traitors? Was Ask in Lyncolne shire,
a scholar of the new teachers? did not he and his company, traitorously
conspire and rebel against their prince, The fruits of popish doctrine.
because their Pilgrimages and Abbayes were suppressed? And what say you to ye
Vicare of Loweth that sturred about the same matter? And in king Edward the
sixth days: who were the Captains and leaders, in every part of England
almost, even in one Summer, but popish priests, and such as had been taught
by them? And what Countries in all England were more quiet at that time, then
were those, where the gospel (which you call new learning) had been most
diligently and faithfully taught?

If you can name us one, that being a teacher of the new learning (as you
term it) has rebelled against his prince: we can find you a dosen of your
Clearks for that one. And then are we in as good case being compared unto you:
as ye Apostles were, being compared to the phariseis. For if one in every
twelfe of us, should be found to bear a traiterous heart toward his prince,
as among the twelve Apostles: there was found one Judas: yet should we always
have a.xj. honest men for one knave, where as amongst the Phariseis and you,
there are to be found for every honest man a.xj. false knaves at the least. And
thus all men may see the end of that learning that you call old.

Now, those fathers whom the world was not worthy to have: were not the
teachers that you learned your Popish faith of: but you learned of those
fathers that were not worthy to have the world. They were not fathers
descended of the right line, but intruders and usurpers, that most cruelly
murdered the children of the right fathers. 2. Petr. 2.
And they are even those lying masters, that saint Peter spoke of in the place
that you cite. etc.

And you and your sort, are even the same that saint John gives us warning of
in the place that you allege? For you abide not in ye doctrine that Christ and
his Apostles did teach: 2. John.
but contrary to that doctrine, you make to your self an head and master
upon earth, and call him the most holy father, teaching his decrees and
ordinances, as the doctrine that all Christ's flock, must under pain of the
loss both of body and soul embrace and obey.

And here saint John does teach us to avoid you and your sort, which do
teach and profess another doctrine, then that which was by the Prophets and
Apostles taught, to be believed and received of all Gods elected and chosen
children throughout the world. This doctrine is not the doctrine of the
Papists.

Watson concludes with a loud lie.
But now you conclude with a loud and shameless lie: Affirming that your
learning (meaning the Pops learning) has universally prevailed, ever since the
ascension of Christ. Bishop Jewel, in his answer to your friend master
Doctor Harding: has most manifestly proved, that you stretch your lie to far
by six hundred years at the least. And how have you followed the word of the
Lord God, to whom you turn your speech and say, if we be disceyued, thou
have disceyued us: seeing he says, drink ye all of this, and you say, No. None
shall drink it but Priests only. Make thee no graven Image (says he) yes
(say you) we will have our Churches full. etc.

Wherefore if God have disceyued you: it is not because you have believed his
word: but because you have loved lies more then truth, and therefore God has
justly given you over In efficaciam erroris, even to the force and strength of
error, 2 Thessalonians. 2.
as saint Paul writes. And so is your error a just punishment for the credit
that you gave unto lies. And although God neither does nor can disceyue any
man, in such sort as you do mean: yet he says that in such meaning as I have
written, Ezech. 14.
he does disceyue such as you are, for the wickedness of such people as you
have instructed.

Thus having spoken something of the scriptures, WATSON. Division. 29
as this short time would permit, there remains also the second thing, which
I said moved me to continue in this faith, which is the authorities of
ancient fathers that have flourished in the preaching of Gods truth in all
ages with authorities. I think verily in no age have been so curiously sought,
so diligent found out, and so substantially wayed, as in this our time.

And all this is because the oppugnation of the truth in this matter, has
extend it self not only to the scriptures but also to the doctors, and to
every particle and title of the doctors, whose wrytings have been so scanned
and tried, that if any thing could have been gathered and piked out of their
books, either by liberal writing before this mystery came in contention, or by
misconstruction of their words, or by deprauatio^ of their meaning, that could
seem to make against our faith herein it was not omitted of some, but stoutly
alleged, amplified, enforced, and set forth to the uttermost that their wits
could conceive, which if God has not infatuat, leaving them to speak so, as
neither faith nor reason could allow: like as they have with their vanities
seduced a great sort the more pity, so they should have undermined and
subverted the faith of a great many mo, that were doubting and falling but not
clean overthrown, thanks be to almighty God.

Of these authorities, although with a little study and less labor, I could
at this time allege a great number, yet considering the shortness of the
time, which is almost spent. I shall be content to pick out a few, which do
not only declare the mind of the author, but also conteyne an argument to
prove and convince the truth of our faith, and such an argument, as neither
figurative speech, nor deprauation of the words or meaning can delude. And
first I shall begin with the weakest, that is with the suspicion of the
Gentiles. Tertullian in his Apology teaches, how the Gentiles did accuse the
Christen men for kylling of young children, ertul. apol. Capit. 7.
and eating of their flesh, he says thus: Dicimur sceleratissimi de
Sacramento infanticidij and pabulo inde. We are reported and accused as most
mischeuous and wicked men, for the sacrament of kylling of children and eating
their flesh, and drincking their blood.

Historia Ecclesiast. lib. 5. Capit. 3.
Eusebius also in this history of the Church, writes of one Attalus a martyr,
who being roasted in an iron Cradell with fire put underneath, when the savor
of his burnt flesh came to the smelling of the people that looked on: he cried
with a loud voice to the people. Lo, this is to eat men which you do, which
fault ye make inquisition of, as secretly done of us, which you commit openly
in the mid day.

By this accusation we may understand, that our sacraments and mysteries in
the beginning of the Church were kept very secret, both from the sight and
knowledge of the Paganes that mocked and scorned them, and also of those that
were Catechumini, learners of our faith and not yet baptized, for many great
causes which I shall not need to rehearse now. And yet for all the secret
keeping of them, being so many Christen men and women as there was, they could
not be kept so secret, but that some ynkeling of them came to the ears of
those that were Infidels and unchristened, insomuch that where as in deed and
very truth by the rules of our religion, we did eat the flesh of Jesus
Christ our Lord, and drink his blood ministered unto us in the sacrament, the
Gentiles as they were curious to know new things, so they came to knowledge of
the rumor of our doings, and either by the bewraying of some false brethren,
or else by the simplicity of other, that of zeal without knowledge would have
converted the unfaithful to our faith, heard secretly, that we christen men
in our mysteries did eat man's flesh and drink man's blood, which they for lack
of faith, and further instruction began to compass in their wits, how it was
possible so to do, and therefore some of them blinded by their own foolish
suspicion conceived and published amongst other, as it was most likely unto
them, that we in our secret mystery, did kill young children, eating their
flesh, and drinking their blood, and thereupon accused certain before the
Magistrates of this heinous crime, which they could never try out to be true,
as they did accuse.

But for our purpose it appears plainly, that we would never have kept our
mysteries so secret, if they had been but ceremonies of eating of bread and
wine, nor they would never have accused us of such beastly and unnatural crimes
being men of such reason, learning and equity, as they were, if there had not
been some truth in their accusation, which in deed was true for the substance
of that they alleged, but not for the manner of the thing: for it was and is
true, that we in our mysteries eat flesh and drink blood, but yet we do not
kill and murder young children, and eat their flesh and drink their blood. And
therefore I allege the sayings of Tertullian and Eusebius, the which is also in
Origin the sixth book contra Celsum, to declare the accusation of the Gentiles
against us, concerning the eating of flesh, and drinking of blood, which could
never have commed into their heads so to have done, if there had not been a
truth in that matter, which they by their reason could never see otherwise,
then they alleged, which we by our faith do plainly see and know as it was
ordained by Christ our Lord. And for that cause Tertullian did cast in a vain
word, saying: that we were accused of the sacrament of kylling of children,
which word (Sacrament) stands there for no purpose, but to declare unto us,
that this their accusation did rise for lack of the true and precise knowledge
of our Sacrament, which is true, concerning the eating of flesh and drinking
of blood, but not true concerning the kylling and murdering of children.

CROWLEY.
After you have something spoken of the scriptures (how much to the purpose, let
the readers of this answer judge) you come to the second thing that you said
did move you to continue in your Popish faith: That is, the Authorities of
ancient fathers that have flourished in all ages, in preaching of Gods truth.
And to make your Auditorie to think that you mean to deal simply: you say
that we have omitted nothing, that either by misconsturing or deprauing might
seem to make against your faith, but have stoutly alleged, amplified,
enforced, and set forth to the uttermost that our wits could conceive. etc.
But when the indifferent reader shall have read over this answer, and weighed
both your doings and mine in misconsturing, deprauing, stout alleging,
amplyfying and enforcing: I doubt not but he shall see, and will say, that the
doings that you charge us withal, are your own. And that whereas by the help
of God we had brought some to the knowledge of your false dealing, so that they
began to lay hand upon the true faith in Jesus Christ: you and your sort have
by subtle perswations, by imprisonment and by torments of fire, driven many of
them, either to deny their faith, or else to hide it, or fly their Country,
and would (if you might have continued) have banished the light of Christ's
glorious Gospel for ever. But the Almighty God be praised for it: your power
is now cut something shorter.

A few Authorities you say, you will pick out, which shall prove and convince
the truth of your faith. And first you will begin with the weakest (as who
should say, the Authorities that shall come in the rearewarde, are thunderbolts
in comparison of the first.) But with little study and less labor: you could
allege a great number. etc.

Well you will begin with Tertullian in his Apology: where he says thus.
Dicimur sceleratissimi etc. Apologet. 7.
We are called most wicked. etc. And to his words you join the words of
Attalus, written by Eusebius. The words are otherwise in Latin, then you do
report them in English. I will therefore, let the reader see them in Latin,
that the learned may judge of both our doings. Attalus vero cum prunis
subteriectis, in sella ferrea torreretur, cunque nidor adustae carnis, ad nares
and ora inspectantis populi perferrebatur, Eccles. hist. lib. 5. ca. 3.
voce magna exclamat ad plebem. Ecce, hoc est homines commedere quod vos
facitis. Quid a nobis velut occultum inquiritis facinus, quod vos aperta luce
committitis? Nos enim neque commedimus homines, neque aliud quid mali agimus.
But when Attalus was roasted in an iron Cradell, with burning coals cast under
it, and when the savor of the burned flesh, was brought to the nostrils and
mouth of the people that stood looking on: he does with a loud voice cry out
unto the people. Behold, this that you do is to eat men. Why do ye search
for amongst us, as for an horrible deed done in secret, that thing which you
your selves do commit in the open light. For we neither eat men, nor do any
other evil thing.

Of these two places you gather a conjecture, that is, that for as much as, the
christians were accused, as eaters of man's flesh and drinkers of man's blood:
there must needs be some occasion of that accusation. Which you can conjecture
to be none other, but the common opinion of the christians, concerning the
substance that they received in the sacrament. Which though they kept as
secretly as possibly they might: yet by one mean or other, it came to the
ears of the enemies of Christen profession. Which for lack of faith could not
conceive that manner of eating flesh and drinking blood that the christians
used. And therefore they bruted abroad their own foolish conjecture: Which
was, that christians did in their sacrifice kill a young Infant, and dip there
sacrificing bread in the blood thereof, and so eat it. But you after your manner
of amplifying, do say, that the christians were accused before certain
Magistrates, of this heinous crime of eating the flesh of young children and
drinking their blood. Which you can find neither in Tertullian nor Eusebius.
But so your tale has a better show for your purpose: that you might conclude,
that it could never have come into the heads of the heathen, thus to accuse
the christians, if there had not been a truth in the matter. And therefore you
conclude that it is true that in those days the christians did, and we do
now, eat flesh and drink blood in the sacrament, but not true concerning
the kylling and murdering of children. This you say is the weakest argument
that you will use, to prove and convince the truth of your faith by.

If this argument be sufficient to prove and convince that we do eat the
flesh and drink the blood of Christ, in the sacrament, after your sort: then
let me make an argument to prove and convince, that in Tertullians days,
christians did give themselves to carnal copulation, either in common, or else
at the least with their own wyfes, immediately after their feast of communion,
even in the same place where they had holden that feast. For Tertullian says
immediately after those words that you cite. An argument like Watsons.
Et post conuiuium incesto, quod euersores luminum canes, lenones silicet,
teneburum and libidinum impiarum inuerecundiam procurent. And it is said that
after the feast, we go to incest, and that Dogs, that is to say, Bawds, which
overthrow the lights, do procure unshamefastness of the darkness and
wicked lusts. Thus they do report of us, says Tertullian. But this suspicion
could never have come into their heads if there had not been a truth in the
matter of carnal copulation, although not incestuously as they did maliciously
brute abroad.

As well does this argument prove and convince this matter, as does your
argument prove that christians did in those days and do now, eat flesh and
drink blood in the sacrament. I can not but marvel what you mean in cyting
Origin contra Celsum: since you have said before, that the accusers of the
christians were men of great reason, learning and equity. For Origin says in
the place that you cite, Origin makes Watsons conjecture to seem untrue.
that for as much as these things be reported of christians, by such as be
nothing acquainted with christian religion: they are adjudged to be vain and
falsely invented against the christians. What reason, learning, and equity can
there be, in men that will falsely invent and spread abroad such abominable
and slanderous reports.

But Tertullian has cast in a word, that makes up the matter, whole on your
side. For he says De sacramento insanticidij. For the sacrament of kylling of
children. But let us see his words together, as Beatus Rhenanus has set them
forth. Dicimur sceleratissimi de sacramento infanticidij, and pabulo Iudae, and
post conuiuium incesto, quod euersores luminum canes, lenones silicet,
tenebrarum and libidinum impiarum inuerecundiam procurent. We are reported to
be the worst men of all, for the sacrament of murdering of children, and the
food of Judas, and for incest after the feast, because Dogs, that is to say
Bawds that overthrow the lights, do procure unshamefastness of darkness
and wicked pleasures.

This word sacrament (you say) is a vain word, and stands there, for no
purpose, but to declare unto us, that their occasion did rise, for lack of the
true and precise knowledge of our sacrament.

If I might be so bold, I would tell you, that your judgment of Tertullians
writing is very vain and foolish, in that you judge him to have cast in this
word sacrament, as serving to none other purpose but as you imagine. For what
is more probable, then that the heathen did report of them that they had a
mystery or sacrament, which did consist in ye murdering of young children? And
does not Rhenanus, in the argument of this book, say yt it was objected to the
christians, that in their divine service, they did kill a young Infant, and
imbrue with his blood, the bread that they would eat. But this was false says
he. But you say it was true concerning the substance of the matter. Well,
Watson against Rhenanus.
I will leave you to deal with Tertullian and Rhenanus, as you can in this
matter.

But I marvel much what you mean, in yt you change Iudae into Inde. You do
English it, eating their flesh, and drinking their blood. I think you have not
found it so in Tertulians works, in any impression that is now to be seen. I
must needs say then, yt you deprave, misconster, and enforce the wrytings of
the ancient fathers, to serve your purpose. I can not see, but you might as
well have suffered it to stand as it was Pabulo Iudae, as to make it Pabulo
inde: saving that then you might not have translated it as you do. But you
must needs have said the food of Judas. And why might not the enemies object
to the Christians these three crimes: The kylling of Infants. The feeding of
Judas And committing of incest? Why might they not imagine, that the Christians
should at their meetings, have one to counterfeyt Christ and another Judas: the
one dypping a sop, and the other receiving the same at his hand? Or why might
they not call the eating of that bloody bread, by the name of Judas feast?

You say, that the Christians kept their mysteries so secret: that the enemies
could have no knowledge of the manner of their doings. But in the same Chapter
Tertullian says thus. Ipsi etiam domesticis nostris quotidie obsi^emur,
quotidie prodimur: in ipsis plurimum caetibus, and co^gregationibus nostris
opprimimur. etc. We our selves also (says Tertullian) are every day beset with
our own families, we are daily betrayed, and very often are we oppressed,
even in our very assembles and congregations. And who did at any time come
suddenly upon us, and find a child crying in such sort? Who did ever find
our mouths bloody, like Cyclopians and Cirenians, and did open the same to
the judge?

By this it is manifest that the Christians did not in those days, keep their
mysteries so secret, as you would have men think they did. Watsons conclusion
follows not.
Neither does that follow that you would conclude, that is, that because the
enemies to christian religion, did imagine that they did murder Infants, and
embrue the bread that they should eat in their communion, with the blood of
those children: therefore it was true, that they did eat the flesh and drink
the blood of Christ in the sacrament, in such real and carnal sort as you
teach.

And yet afterward our mysteries as they came in more knowledge amongs the
Gentiles, WATSON. Division. 30
so they came into more contempt: for when the multitude of Christian men were
so increased, that they cared not who did look upon them in the time of their
mysteries, being out of fear of any external violence and persecution then
the Gentiles seeing them knock, and kneel, and make adoration to the sacraments,
not knowing them to be any thing else, but as their eyes, senses, and reason
did judge, that is to say, bread and wine as our sacramentaries do now, being
blinded now with heresy, as they before were with infidelity: then I say,
they said, that we did not worship and adore one God, as we pretended, but
many Gods, as they were accustomed: for they said (as saint Augustine writes)
that we did worship Ceres and Bacchus, the Gods of Corn and Wine, August con.
sanst. libr. 20 Capit. 13.
taking our sacraments to be nothing else, but bare bread and wine, as the
Sacramentaries do and not to be Christ our Lord and God, his flesh and his
blood, as all true faithful men do, which appears by the adoration of them:
the which adorarion we learn that it was done to the sacraments from the
beginning, as is proved by the testimonies of our enemies the Gentiles, as saint
Augustine reports. And also by their adoration we learn, that the things
which they did adore, were not simple creatures, but Christ's body and his
blood, united to the second person in Trinity.

Saint Basil being asked, with what fear, persuasion, Basilius in reg. in
terrog. 172.
faith, and affection we should come and communicate the body and blood of
Christ, answers thus: Concerning the fear, we have the saying of the
Apostle. He that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks his
judgment and damnation.

What faith we should have, the words of our Lord do teach, who said: This is
my body which is given for you, do this in my remembrance. Hesichius li. 6.
ca. 22.
And Hesichius says likewise: Sermo qui prolatus est in dominicum mysterium,
ipse liberat nos ab ignorantia. The words of Christ, which were spoken upon
our Lords mystery, they deliver us from ignorance that is to say, they
teach us, what faith, what estimation we should have of them. Now except
they be taken as they sound to every man, although he be unlearned and not
instructed in our faith before, they could not teach us, what faith we should
have, concerning the sacraments, and therefore in that they be words,
whereupon we must learn our faith, which deliver us from ignorance, what the
things be, that be delivered, for that cause they must be taken as they sound,
that is to say, that the sacraments delivered be the very body and blood of
Christ, that gave them.

(...) ^om. 17. in Math.
Chrysostom says. Quod sacerdos de manu sua dat, non solum sanctificatum est:
sed etiam sanctificatio est. That thing that the Priest does give out of his
hand, is not only a thing sanctified: but it is sanctification it self.
Therefore our sacrament, must not only be an holy thing, as they said, holy
bread, holy wine: but it must be the substance of holiness, making all other
things holy.

And here I think it worthy to be noted, and to be opened somewhat unto you,
with what sophistry and unlearned folly they deluded the sanctification and
consecration of this sacrament. Children at the University can tell, that it
is a deceytfull way of reasoning, by a general description to exclude and
drive away a special and singular definition, as they did in this case. For
they said, that the consecration of the sacrament was no more, but an
appointing of bread and wine to an holy use, which use they said was to
signify unto us Christ's body that is in heaven: and therefore some said,
that the bread was consecrat, when the parish Clarke did bring it to the
Church, and set it upon the table, and these were no small men, but our
greatest Bishops God forgive it them: other said it was not consecrate, till
the words of Christ were spoken, but yet they noted, that the Priest should
not look at the bread in the time of the pronouncing, for this end belike,
that they should not be disceyued, and that God should work no more then it
pleased them, that their doctrine might some way be true.

And therefore they said, every man and woman might consecrate and speak the
words as well as a Priest: but they never read what Arnobius says: Arniobus in
Psalm. 139.
Quid tam magnificum quam Sacramenta deuina conficere? and quid tam
perniciosum, quam si ea is conficiat, qui nullum sacerdotij gradum accepit?
What is so excellent, then to consecrate the sacraments of God? and what is so
pernicious, then if he do consecrate: that has received no order and degree
of Priesthood? And as they erred in the time and person, so they erred in the
nature of the consecration, making this of the same sort that all other
consecrations be, receiving the general description, and denying the degrees
and specialties of sanctification, which be many: for somethings be holy, not
for any holiness that is in them, but for that they be brought to the Church,
and dedicate to some holy use, as is the temple of God, the vestures about the
altar, and other things used in Gods service, which things to steal and
convey is sacrilege, and amongst those things there be degrees of holiness, as
saint Augustine says: Quod accipiunt Catechumini, August, de peccat merit and
remiss. libr. 2. ca. 26.
quamuis non sit corpus Christi, sanctum est tamen, and sanctius quam cibi
quibus alimur. Holy bread which those that be learners receive, although it be
not the body of Christ, yet it is holy, and more holy then the meat, with which
we are fed daily, which also is sanctified by the word and prayer.

There is also holiness, a quality, a virtue, and gift of God, making him in
whom it is, acceptable in the sight of God. The soul of man is likewise
sanctified and holy, because it is that substance and subject wherein
holiness consists and dwells, being a vessel created to Gods image, and
prepared to receive Gods gift of sanctification and holiness.

And the body of a godly man is also sanctified and holy, because it is the
member of Christ, the temple of the holy Ghost, and the house and tabernacle of
the soul, replenished with Gods grace and sanctification and for this reason
we have in reverence and estimation the relics and bodies of holy martyrs and
confessors, which being members of Christ, were also pleasing sacrifices to
Almighty God, either for austeritie of life, or for suffering of undeserved
death, for the faith or in the quarrel of Jesus Christ our Lord.

The sacraments of Gods Church be justly called holy, because they be the
instruments, whereby God does work holiness in the soul of man, and be as
causes of the same, by Christ's own ordinance and institution. But above all
other, this sacrament of the altar is holy, being as Chrysostom said, not
only a thing sanctified, but the very sanctification it self. For in that it
is the body of Christ by consecration, whereunto is annexed the Godhead by
unity of person: it must needs be holiness it self, not in quality, but in
substance, seeing whatsoever thing is in God, is also God, who for his
simplicity receives no quality into himself, but is the author and
principal cause of all good qualities and graces given unto man. Wherefore,
this place of Chrysostom that calls it sanctification it self, can not be
avoided, by no figurative speeches, or such like cauillations.

CROWLEY.
Here you begin with a loud lie (by your leave) for there was never time yet
wherein true christen men, cared not who looked upon them in the time of their
mysteries: Two loud lies, one in another neck.
but they did shut out from the place where they did communicate, all that were
not thought meet to be partakers with them. And if you believe not me, look
in your Liturgies of James, Basil, and Chrysostom. And then you clap another
lie even in the neck of the first, saying that the Christians made a knocking
and kneeling, and adoration to the sacraments: and that, that was the thing
that moved the Gentiles to say, that we worship many Gods, and not one as we
pretend. But to prove this to be no lie: you take saint Austen to witness. Who
in the place that you cite, says thus, speaking to Faustus the Maniche.
Quomodo ergo comparas panem and Calicem nostrum, and parem Religionem dicis,
errorem long a veritate discretum: peius desipiens quam nonnulli, qui nos
propter Panem and Calicem: Cererem and liberum colere existimant. How do
thou therefore, compare our bread and cup, and say, that an error, which
differs very far from the truth, is as good a religion as ours, being
more fondly disceyued, then are certain, which by reason of the bread and cup,
do suppose, that we do worship Ceres and Bacchus. And in the same Chapter, he
says. Sicut enim a Cerere and libero, Paganorum dijs long absumus, quamuis
Panis and Calicis sacramentum, quod ita laudastis, vt in eo nobis pares esse
volueritis, nostroritu amplectamur. etc For even as we are very far from
Ceres and Bacchus, Gods of ye Paganes, although we do after our manner embrace
the sacrament of the bread and the cup, which you have so highly commended,
because you would therein be like unto us: even so our fathers were far
enough from ye chains of Saturn, although they did during the time of
prophecy, observe the calling or name of the Sabbath.

The same Gentiles, which had said that the christians did worship Ceres and
Bacchus, because they used bread and wine in their communion: had said also,
that the people of the Jews were appointed to be the people of Saturn,
because they observed the seventh day of their week for their Sabbath or rest,
which day, the heathen did dedicate unto Saturn. Saint Austen therefore does
answer, that both the Jews and the Christians, are far enough from serving
either Saturn, Ceres, or Bacchus: notwithstanding that the one of them
observed the seventh day, and the other used bread and wine in their communion.

And a little before in the same Chapter also, he utters his mind very
plainly, against the gross opinion of the Manichies, which held that they did
in all manner of meats, wherewith they sustained their bodies, eat Jesus
Christ, even as you hold, that you eat him in the sacrament, receiving him
into your bodies, by the ministry of your mouths.

Of this gross eating of Christ, does Austen write thus in that place. Vobis
autem per fabulam vestram, in escis omnibus Christus ligatus apponitur: adhuc
ligandus vestris visceribus, soluendusque ructatibus. Nam cum manducatis: Dei
vestri defectione vos reficitis. Et cum digeritis: illius ref^ctione deficitis.
Cum enim vos plenos reddit: resumptio vestra ipsum premit. etc. But if your
fable be true: you have Christ fast bound, set before you in every meat that
you eat, and must be bound again in your bowels, and unbound by your
belkings. For when you do eat, you do refresh your selves by ye consuming of
your God, and when you loose the belly: you do by his refreshing, faint or
decay. For when he does fill you full: your receiving of him again does
oppress him. Which thing might be accounted for a deed of mercy, seeing that
he does in you suffer something for you: except he did again leave you empty,
that being delivered from you, he might escape.

You thought belyke, that no man would take the pains to weigh this place of
Austen: and therefore you were bold to cite his words to prove that, which
none that is learned will deny: That is, Watson does miss of his purpose.
that the Gentiles did suppose and say, that the christians did worship Ceres
and Bacchus, because they used bread and wine in their sacrament. But your
purpose was, so to cite his words that he might seem to allow that which you
had said before, concerning the knocking and kneeling, and making of adoration
to the sacrament as to Christ himself: which these very words that I have
reported out of the same Chapter, do flatly deny.

And where you say that adoration has been done to the sacraments even from
the beginning: you shall never be able to prove it, for the testimony of the
heathen that you stick unto, is disproued. Neither shall you be able to prove,
that we, whom you call sacramentaries: do judge the sacrament to be nothing
else but bare bread and wine. But we confess, that Christ is received of the
worthy receyuer, although not carnally as you teach.

Yea, we say with Austen in that same place that you do cite. Noster autem
Panis and Calix non quilibet, quasi propter Christum in spicis and sarmentis
ligatum, sicut illi desipiunt: sed certa consecratione, mysticus fit nobis, non
nascitur. etc. Our bread and cup be not of the common sort, as in steed of
Christ bound together in ears of corn and twigs, as they (that is, the
Manichies) do foolishly imagine: but by undoubted consecration, it is made
unto us, mystical or sacramental bread, it does not grow such, wherefore
that food that is not so made, although it be bread and wine: it is a
nourishment of refection, but not a sacrament of religion, otherwise then that
we bless and give thanks to God in all his gifts, not only spiritual, but
corporal also.

Thus may all men see, that no man can allege better matter for us, then that
which Austen has written, even in the place that you have produced against us.
Such is your luck in framing of Arguments, to prove and convince the truth of
your faith.

But what has Basil said to this matter? In the.172. Basil. magnus in Reg.
Interrogat. 70.
question, you say (by your note in the margin) but you should have said.70.
Saint Basil being asked. etc. But because you have not dealt so faithfully in
reporting writers minds as ye might: I will write his words in Latin. Quali
timore, vel fide, vel affectu, percipere debemus, corporis and sanguinis
Christi gratiam Pater? Basilius. Timorem quidem docet nos Apostolus dicens. Qui
manducat and bibit indigne: iudicium sibi manducat and bibit, non diiudicans
corpus Domini. Fidem vero edocet nos sermo Domini dicentis: Hoc est corpus meum
quod pro multis datur: hoc facite in meam commemorationem. Et iterum sermo
Iohannis dicentis, quod verbum caro factum est, and habitauit in nobis. The
Monk moves this question to S. Basil. Father (says he) with what fear,
faith and affection, ought we to receive ye grace or free gift of the body and
blood of Christ? Basil answers. The Apostle does teach us with what fear
we should receive it, when he says: Who so does eat and drink unworthily,
does eat and drink his own condemnation, because he makes no difference of
the Lords body. And the words of ye Lord when he says. This is my body which
is given for many, do this in remembrance of me: do perfitly teach us faith.
And again the words of John when he says. The son of God is become flesh and
has dwelt amongst us. etc.

First, I must tell you, that you have enforced Basil to speak otherwise in
English through your lips: then either he wrote in Greek: or his
translatour, in Latin. For he speaks not of communicating the body and blood
of Christ: but of receiving the grace and free gift of the body and blood of
Christ. Neither does he say, which is given for you, but for many. I note this,
to give men occasion to consider, what silly shifts you seek to have a little
advantage. The fathers used sometimes to call ye sacraments Gratias, graces, or
free gifts of mercy. In this place therefore, S. Basil does use Gratiam, for
Sacramentum. So that the question is in none other meaning the^ thus. With what
fear etc. must we receive the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ? but
this makes nothing for your purpose, therefore you enforce him to say, with what
fear. etc. should we come to communicate the body and blood of Christ? As
though Basil had affirmed the sacrament to be the body and blood of Christ, in
such sort as you affirm it to be. But these shifts will not serve you, so long
as men may come to the sight of those authors works that you do so wrest for
your purpose, and be able to weigh their words and gather their meaning aright.

Isychius. li. 6. Capit. 22.
Isychius also says likewise (say you) And you cite his words thus. Sermo
qui prolatus est. etc. The words of Christ which were spoken. etc. whether the
fault be in you or your Printer, I cannot tell: but in as many places as this
writer is named in your Sermons, he is misnamed. For his name is not Hesichius,
but Isychius. But to the matter.

Isychius expounding the.22. Chapter of Leuiticus, does amongst other things
declare what is meant by the eating of holy things by ignorance. And what is
meant by the fifth part, that Moses commanded to be added to the holy thing
eaten by ignorance, and given to the Priest into the sanctuary, with the holy
thing that was eaten by ignorance.

Of what antiquity this Isychius was, and how worthy credit his writings are.
I find none so good testimony, as in Johannes Tritemius, sometime Abbot of
Spanheimens, who says that he has read this work of his. He himself in the
preface of his book, says, that of necessity the interpretation must be
drawn to the Anagogicall sense. Whereby it is manifest, that his opinion was,
that such places of the book that he does expound, Isychius to much given to
the Anagogical sense.
as had any difficulty in the litterall sense: must be so drawn to the
Anagogicall sense, as though there were no litterall sense to be observed in
them. Which is contrary to the rule of all good interpretours, whose care is
always to have an especial regard to the letter. Whereof this common saying
springs. Maledicta glossa quae corrumpit textum. Curssed is the gloss, that
does corrupt the text. And that it may appear that he is of that mind in
deed: consider his words which are written not much before that which you do
cite, where he says thus. Quomodo cius quod iam comedit and consumpsit, addere
quis quintam potest: How is any man able, to add the fifth part of that thing,
which he has already eaten and consumed? In these words, he shows him
self to be within the reach of that curse that saint Hierome does pronounce,
upon all them that say that God has commanded any thing to be done, which is
not possible to be done. Yea he shows himself to be a man of very small
discretion: that could not conceive how this commandment might be fulfilled
after the letter. For what is more plain then to say? He that eats five
apples of another man's: shall add a fifth part, and give the same to him that
ought the five apples that he has eaten. Will any wise man say, that it is
not possible so to do, because he has already eaten and consumed the five
apples? I think not. But every wise man will say: This man that has eaten his
neighbors five apples: must take so many of the same kind and goodness that
the other which he has eaten were, and add thereunto one of the same kind
and goodness also: and then give those six apples to him that ought those
that he has eaten. And why may not Moses words be so understood, when he
says. Addet quintam partem cum eo quod comedit? He shall add the fifth part,
with that which he has eaten? It may be that this Isychius of yours was some
great Clearke: but surely, he has not in this point showed himself to be the
wisest man.

As for the Anagogicall sense that he does gather upon this place: I do not
mislike. I suppose that it may well be said, that those men do eat the holy
things by ignorance, that do receive the mystery or sacrament of Christ's
body, not knowing the dignity and virtue thereof. And where he says, that the
fifth part that must be added, is the words that Christ spoke over the
mysteries: I can not but allow it to be a good Anagogicall sense. For that
word does deliver us from ignorance, and makes us to understand, that those
creatures are not now to be used and considered, as when we take them for the
sustentation of our bodies: but as mysteries, and therefore those words do
remove us from the carnal and earthy consideration of them, to that
consideration of them that is heavenly.

Thus do I like very well with your Isychius for his Anagoge. And whether he
were the hearer of Cregorie Nazianzen or not: I force not. But to tell you
plain what I think: I take him not to be so ancient, The antiquity of
Isychius.
but one that has written since Glossa ordinaria was published. For, the very
same Anagoge is there, and yet not cited out of Isychius. And you know that,
that Glosser, does always note the names of those ancient fathers that
minister him any matter.

But the conclusion that you make upon Isychius words: I utterly mislike. And
I suppose, that Isychius himself, if he were living, could not like well with
you, for abusing his word to such a purpose. For in his preface, he says
thus: Nec enim reprehendere quis Anagogae interpretationes, Isychius against
Watsons doings.
nec intellectuum co^syderationem, nec littera praesumat explanationem, neque
noster quispiam, neque alienus. Let no man (either that is of our religion or
other) presume to find fault with Anagogicall interpretations, nor with the
consideration of understandings, nor the explanation of the letter. You deserve
no thanks of Isychius therefore, to conclude upon his words, yt the words which
our savior christ spoke when he delivered the sacramental bread and wine:
must needs be taken even as they sound to every unlearned man, and that
therefore the sacraments be the very body and blood of Christ that gave them.

Now must we see what Chrysostom has said in this matter. In his.17.
Homily upon Matthew, he says thus (say you) Quod sacerdos etc. That thing that
the Priest does give. etc. A man might marvel, what moved you to seek out such
suspected writings as this is: when ye boast to pick out a few arguments that
can not be deluded, either by figurative speech, or deprauation of words or
meaning.

All learned men say, that they know not who wrote those Homilies wherout you
cite those words. In deed Chrysostom did write.89. Homilies upon Mathewe. But
this.17. that you cite, is none of them. Neither are these nor any like words
found in any of those.89. Homilies.

And besides this, those Homilies that you pick these words out of, have in
them some blasphemous doctrine. As that Christ is not equal with his father,
and that the holy Ghost is but a minister or servant to Christ. Yea, and in the
eleventh of those Homilies, you shall find that the Aucthor thereof is flat
against you, For he says thus. Si ergo haec vasa sanctificata, ad profanos
vsus transfer sic periculosum est, in quibus non est verum corpus Christi,
Watsons own Chrysostom against Watson himself.
sed mysterium corporis Christi continetur: quanto magis vasa corporis nostri,
quae sibi deus ad habitaculum preparauit, non debemus locum dare Diabolo,
agendi in eis quod vult? If it be so dangerous a thing therefore, to translate
to a profane use those vessels that be sanctified, wherein the very body of
Christ is not, but the mystery of Christ's body is therein contained: how much
more ought we not to give the vessels of our body (which God has prepared to
be a dwelling for himself) to be a place for the Devil to work his will in.

Here you see what luck you have, when you advance the authority of obscure
matter, by cyting the same under the names of such as be famous. No man can
speak more plainly against you, then this man does in this place.

But what though he had not written this, but had written only of this matter,
in such sort as you have cyted his words, and were of as great authority as
ever was Chrysostom: what had you won by his words, when they be taken
whole together? I will therefore add those words that you leave out: that the
indifferent reader may judge. Quoniam hoc non solum datur: quod videtur, sed
etiam illud quod intelligitur. So that his words together are thus much. That
thing yt the priest does deliver out of his hand, is not only sanctified, but
it is sanctification: because, not only that which is seen is delivered, but
ye thing that is understood also.

We grant, that the thing signified and understood by the sacrament, is
delivered by the minister, and received by the receyuer that is a member of
Christ: but not in such sort as you hold. Sacramentally and spiritually, the
thing that is signified and understood is given and received, as I have
before declared. These words therefore, taken together and rightly weighed, do
make nothing against us, but rather with us, notwithstanding that we neither
draw them to the figurative manner of speaking, nor yet deprave the words or
meaning of the writer.

But a perilous point of sophistry, you think meet to be noted, and some
what opened to your auditorie. Children at the university can tell: that to
exclude a special and singular definition, by a general description, is a
deceitful way of reasoning.

It is commonly seen that such as do use to dig pits for other to fall
into: do fall into the same themselves first of al. Your purpose was, by
preferring the knowledge of children in the university, before the knowledge
of your betters in learning, which were Bishops in king Edward the sixth days:
Watson going about to deface other, is defaced himself.
utterly to deface those learned fathers, and to bring them out of credit, as
men that knew not so much, as children in ye university do know And so to
extol your own knowledge above the stars. For you are none of the babes at
the university. But when your words shall be well weighed: they shall be
found more babishe and foolish, then commonly can be found among the children
at the university.

A special and singular definition (you say) is excluded by a general
description. A child at the university would ask you: what manner of
definition that is, which you call special and singular. And in whose Logic
he might learn to know that definition. The Logitians that hither to have
written: have made no mention of any such definition. Boethius makes mention of
many sorts of definitions: but of this that you speak of, he makes no
mention at all. Commonly, the authors write but of four sorts of definitions.
One Essential, another Causall, the third Integrall, and the fourth
Accidental.

And besides this the children might ask you: how special and singular, may
in Logical matter, be both verified of one thing, in one and the same respect,
and at one time, as you do here use them. Those therefore, whom (in derision)
you call no small men, but your greatest Bishops: if they were now living,
would make the world see, that for your good knowledge in Logic, A worthy
promotion.
yt you show in this Sermon: you might leave the Divines Chair, and set you
down amongst the babbling Sophists again, till you had gotten you better skill
in Logic.

The general description of consecration, that those men did receive, shall be
found as good a definition of the same: as you or any of your sort shall be
able to make. The consecration that those men received, is that benediction and
decree of Christ: whereby the visible signs are appointed to an holy use. We
speak not of your general consecration, whereby the heathen and you Papists,
have without any warant of the word of God, yea, contrary to Gods word,
consecrated so many of Gods creatures to Idols and Idol service: but we
speak of consecration that Christ himself has made and does still make, as
often as his Church and congregation, do take his creatures, and use them
according to his commandment, to represent unto their senses, those invisible
graces that he has appointed those creatures to signify to us.

And this is no new devise: for Chrysostom in his.30. Homily, which is of the
treason of Judas says thus. Chrisost. hom..30. De proditione Iudae.
Et nunc ille praesto est Christus, qui illam ornauit mensam, ipse ipsam quoque
consecrat. Non enim homo est, qui proposita de consecratione mensae Domini,
corpus Christi facit and sanguinem: sed ille qui crucifixus pro nobis est
Christus. Sacerdotis ore verba proferuntur: sed Dei virtute consecrantur and
gratia. Hoc est, ait, corpus meum, hoc verbo proposita consecrantur. Et sicut
illa vox quae dicit, crescite and multiplicamini, and replete terram, semel
quidem dicta est, sed omni tempori sentit effectum ad generationem operante
natura: ita and vox illa, semel quidem dicta est sed per omnes mensas Ecclesiae
vsque ad hodiernum diem, and vsque ad eius aduentum, praestat saccrificio
firmitatem. The same Christ that did adourne and beautify that table: is now
present, and he does consecrate the same also. For it is not a man that does
make those things that be set before us of the consecration of the Lords table,
to be the body and blood of Christ: but the same Christ which was crucified for
us. The words are pronounced by the mouth of the Priest: but the things are
consecrated by the power and grace of God. This is (says he) my body: by this
word are the things that be set before us consecrated. And even as that voice
which says, grow and be multiplied, and replenishe the earth, was but once
spoken, but yet does at all times, by the work of nature feel effect to
generation: so that voice also was but once spoken, and yet it gives sure stay
to the sacrifice, throughout all the tables of the Church, even to this day and
from henceforth till his coming.

Chrysostom does here compare the words that Christ spoke at the institution
of his supper, to the words that God spoke when he appointed man to be
multiplied by generation: affirming that the same power that works still in
the one, does still work in the other also. Christ is no charmer.
Not to charm out the substance of bread, and to charm in the substance of
Christ under the accidents of bread (as you teach) but that as by natural
order, the generation of mankind is continued according to the first voice: so
the invisible graces that were promised by the death and blood shedding of our
savior Christ, are by the sacramental use of those creatures according to his
commandment, continually preached to our senses, and by faith received into
our souls.

And where as you say, that some of us have said, that every man and woman may
consecrate: you must name them that have so said, or cite the words yt such
have written, else will men say that you do belie us, and that you might well
have spared the words of Arnobius, which you do cite, affirming yt we did
never read them.

But whether we have read the words of Arnobius or not: it may seem that you
did never understand them. For if you had, you would not have translated, so,
and then: for so, and as, nor consecrate for conficere. But you would have
said: What is so excellent: as to go through with the ministration of Gods
sacraments? And what is so pernicious, as if the same be done, by that man that
has taken no degree of priesthood?

The purpose of Arnobius in this place, is to prove, that the presumption to
do contrary to Gods commandment: The fruits of presumption.
is it that makes the actions of men, which otherwise are good, to be
exceeding evil. For what (says he) is so holy a thing, as to receive the
communion of Christ? And what is so wicked, as if one that is not baptized
receive ye same. And what can be more pernicious, then that a man that is not
called to the office of ministration: should take upon him to minister the
sacraments of Christ?

I think you be not able to prove, that any of us has either spoken or
written to the contrary of that which Arnobius teaches in this place. You can
not therefore justly say, that we do err, either in the time or person. For
we hold, that when the congregation of Christ assembled together, do by the
mouth of their leafully called minister, give thanks to God for the death and
passion of his son Christ, and according to Christ's holy institution, take
bread and wine to divide it amongst them in remembrance of his death and
passion: then is that consecration that Chrysostom speaks of, wrought by
Christ himself that first did institute this holy mystery, and willed his
Church to use the same in his remembrance till his coming again.

As touching the holiness of creatures: De Peccatorum merit. and remis. libro.
2. Capit. 26.
we say as Austen does in the place that you do cite: Non vnius modi est
sa^ctificatio. etc. Sanctification, is after more sorts then one. For I suppose
that such as be yet but learners of christen religion: are after a certain
peculiar manner sanctified, by the sign of Christ, and the prayer of the laying
on of hands. And that thing which they do receive, although it be not the
body of Christ: yet it is holy, and more holy, then is the meat that we are fed
withal, because it is a sacrament: The same Apostle also has said, that the
very meats wherewith we are fed for the necessity of the sustayning of this
life: are sanctified by the word of God and prayer, which we use when we are
about to refreshe our bodies.

Here, let the indifferent reader judge, how faithfully you have handled this
place of Austen. First, you leave out the first part of the sentence, that
might give light to the understanding of Austens meaning. And where Austen
shows, that the thing that the learners of christian religion do receive, is
holy, because it is a sacrament: you pass over that, A homely shift.
with other words that might sound somewhat against your purpose, and knit up
the matter with these words: which also is sanctified by the word and prayer.
And make your hearers think that your manner of dealing holy bread was used in
saint Austens time: you translate this word Quod. Holy bread.

Saint Austens meaning, is to declare, that as there is holiness in creatures,
by such means as God has appointed for the sanctifying of his creatures: so
is not their holiness alyke, but one is more holy then another. The learners
of Christen religion were holy: Degrees of holynesses.
yet not so holy as were those that being fully instructed, were baptized. So,
the bread, which they received, in token of the love that those which were
already baptized, did bear toward them, was holy (for as saint Austen
says, it was a sacrament, that is, an holy sign) yet was it not so holy, as
that sacramental bread, which christians did according to Christ's
institution, divide amongst them. And yet it was more holy then the common
bread that is made holy when we pray before we take it for the sustinaunce of
our bodies.

The other holynesses also that you speak of, we deny not. Neither do we
deny that the sacraments of God be holy, Watson overthrows that before he
did build.
because they be instruments. etc. But here I must note, that you do in this
place, overthrow, that which you have so greatly labored to build. For you
do here make the sacraments, but as isntrumental causes of holiness: where
as you have before stoutly affirmed, that they be in deed: the efficient
causes of wonderful holy effects.

But as one that had ouerslipt himself: you correct your self somewhat
subtly, affirming that above all, the sacrament of the altar is holy. etc.
Where fearing least you should not commend it enough: August. ad Dardanum.
you fall into that inconvenience, that S. Austen did warn Dardanus to shun.
Cauendum est enim. etc. We must take heed, that we do not so affirm the
Deuinitie of the manhood, that we take away the truth of the body. You say
that the sacrament of the altar must needs be holiness it self: because the
Godhead is by unity of person annexed to it. For (say you) whatsoever thing is
in God: is God also. So that by this doctrine, the manhood of Christ is so
confounded with the Godhead, that it is clean consumed and become God,
contrary to that which the true Catholic Church does confess with
Athanasius. 1. Timoth. 2.
And we have no man Christ to be our Mediator, as saint Paul writes: and so
consequently no salvation by Christ. This consequent must needs follow upon
that which you teach in your sermon: and can not be avoided by any figurative
speech, or such like cauillations.

WATSON. Division. 31.
The same Chrysostom in his Epistle to Innocentius Bishop of Rome writes of
the manner of the persecution in his time, not unlike to this of ours. Chrysostom.
Epist. ad Innocentium.
Nam and sanctuarium ingressi sunt milites, quorum aliquos scimus nullis
inatiatos mysterijs, and viderunt omnia quae intus erant: quin and sanctissimus
Christi sanguis (sicut in tali tumultu contingit) in praedictorum militum
vestes effusus est. The soldiers came violently into the holy place, of whom
we know that some were not baptized, and there they saw all things that were
within, and the most holy blood of Christ (as chances often in such a tumult)
was shed upon the garments of those soldiers.

Here I mark that he says not the figure or sign of Christ's blood, but the
most holy blood, an other inferior creature can not be most holy. Also I mark
that this most holy blood was reserved there in the holy temple, and was not
only in Heaven to be received by faith of the faithful, but also was in the
temple and violently handeled of the unfaithful, being there contemned,
abused, and spilt upon their garments. Does not this barbaricall violence, and
external situation of the most holy blood of Christ, prove a real presence of
the same in the sacrament?

Gregory Nazianzene speaks after the like manner, Nazianze. orat, ad Arianos.
how that the Arians would not suffer the Catholics to pray in their temples,
but troubled them, and killed them and mingled Christ's mystical blood, with
the blood of the Catholic Priests, which they slew and so forth: whereby we
understand a real presence of Christ's blood by that violence, that was
showed unto it of the heretics part, though Christ were there after that sort,
that he could suffer no violence of his part.

We read in saint Hierome and in diverse other: Hieronimus ad hedibiam.
Ipsa conuiua and conuiuium, comedens and qui comeditur, that Christ is both
the eater of the feast, and the feast it self, both the eater and the meat
that is eaten. Whereby we understand, that Christ giving his body and his
blood to his disciples, did receive the same himself before.

And as Chrysostom writes that least his Disciples should have been troubled
and offended, hearing him say. Chrysostom. in Math. hom. 83.
This is my blood, Euthymius in Mat. cap. 64.
drink ye all of this, as the Caparnaites were before, and so should abhor
to have drunk of the same. Christ did first drink of the same cup before
them, that he might by his example induce his Disciples to drink likewise.

Hesichius in Leuit. li. 2. Cap. 8.
And Hesechius says: Ipse dominus primus in caena mystica intelligibilem
accepit sanguinem atque deinde calicem Apostolis dedit: Our Lord himself in
the mystical supper, first drank his own blood, that was not seen, but
understood, and then gave the cup to his Apostles. By this fact of Christ we
may learn that in the cup was verily and really Christ's own blood, or if
Christ did eat his body, and drank his blood but in figure, then he did eat
and drink it before after that manner in the Tipicall and Legal supper; and
then how can this mistical supper be the truth, and the other the figure, if
this be but a figure likewise? And then why should the Apostle be afraid to
do that now, they were wont to do always before. It was no new thing,
worthy the new Testament, to eat and drink Christ in a figure: and therefore
it is certain, that Christ in his mystical supper did not eat and drink his
body and blood only figuratively. And if ye will say, that he eat it and
drank it spiritually only, then ye must say, that Christ did eat it by
faith, for spiritual eating is believing. And if ye say, Christ did believe, then
it follows that Christ was not God. Who has perfect knowledge of al things by
sight, and not imperfect knowledge by faith, as we have, seeing as through a
Glass in a dark rydle. And surely they harp much upon this string: for this
heresy against the presence of Christ in the sacrament, is an high way,
leading to the other heresy, that Christ is not God, as is proved by diverse
ways and arguments, into which pit diverse be falling by this means, if God
do not put under his hand to stay them betimes: for if they continue long in
this, they will fall into the other no remedy, whereof we have already seen
experience.

Then if Christ did eat his body, and drink his blood in the mystical
supper, neither figuratively, as he did in the Paschall lamb nor yet
spiritually as we do by faith: then it is certain, that he eat it only
sacramentally, which is not only in sign (as the sacramentaries expound the
word) but in truth under a sacrament, whereof the substance is the real and
natural body and blood of Christ our Lord.

After this sort writes Chrysostom of David, saying thus: Non contigit David
gustare talem hostiam, Chrysostom. hom. de David and Saul.
neque particeps fuerat sanguinis dominici, sed legibus imperfectioribus
educatus, neque tale quicquam exigentibus: tamen ad euangelicae philosophiae
fastigium peruenit animi moderatione. It never chanced to David to taste of
such a sacrifice, nor he was nor receauer and partaker of our Lords blood, but
being brought up under laws not so perfect, and requiring no such thing, yet
by the moderation and temperaunce of his own mind, he came to the hight of
all Evangelical Divinity.

Here is plain that David did never taste and receive Christ's blood as we do
in the Gospel, and yet David did receive Christ's blood figuratively, being
partaker of the sacrifices of the old law which were figures of Christ's
blood and also he did drink of the same blood spiritually as we do, whose
faith was as good or rather greater then ours. Therefore there remains one
other way that we drink of it, which was not granted unto him, that is to say,
verily and really in the sacrament.

To avoid this place well they must have mo solutions then they have invented
yet, for neither figuratively nor spiritually will serve, it were best for them
to yield to the truth, and confess that it is there really, the very same
substance of his blood, that was shed upon the cross, though not in that
form, for the relief of our weak nature, which else could not sustain it.

Here you have heaped together the sayings of certain writers, CROWLEY.
to confirm that which you have hitherto labored to prove: and do persuade
your self, that you have sufficiently proved. And first you begin with
Chrysostom. Another is not the same.
The same Chrysostom say you. etc. Here I must put you in remembrance of that
which I have said before, that the sentence which you cited before as out of
Chrysostom was none of his. Wherefore you do wrong to John Chrysostom, to
say that he is the same. But to the purpose. You say that you mark in this
place of Chrysostom: that he says not the figure or sign of Christ's blood:
but the most holy blood. And another inferior creature can not be most holy. A
foul oversight in one that would be a Catholic Bishop.
etc. Here I must tell you that you have forgotten your duty toward your
most holy father of Rome. etc. And unadvisedly, you have denied him that title,
that all your brethren the papists, do think him worthy to have:
notwithstanding he is but one of the inferior creatures. And further I must
tell you, that you seem to have forgotten that which you spoke but a little
before, affirming the sacrament to be God, and so no creature: but now when you
do couple it with another inferior creature, your words do import, that you
do account it among the inferior creatures.

But for the meaning of Chrysostomes words in that place: you will neither
consider the custom of the fathers (which was to call the sacraments by the
names of those things whereof they be sacraments) neither what it was that
Chrysostom labored to bring to pass by this Epistle. His whole purpose was,
so to stir up the detestation of the doings of those wicked men in the heart
of Innocentius: that he might thereby be moved, to seek by all possible
means, to have that horrible fact punished. Which may right well appear by
his words in the same Epistle, where he says thus. Ad Innocentium.
Igitur Domini maxim venerandi, and pij, cum haecitase habere didiceritis:
studium vestrum and magnam diligentiam adhibete, quo retrudatur haec quae in
Ecclesias irrupit iniquitas. Therefore, my Lords most godly and worthy to be
reverenced, when you shall understand that these things be even so: employ
your study, and great diligence, that this inquitie that rusheth into the
Churches, may be beaten back. The scope of the Epistle.
Here is the scope of his whole Epistle. And to bring this to pass, he uses
as much Art as he is able, both in setting forth the horriblenesse of the fact,
and also the danger that was imminent if it should be suffered unpunished, his
own innocence, and the good opinion that he had in those men that he wrote
unto.

These things considered: no man that knows what Art means, will think
that Chrysostomes words in this place do give you such vauntage against us,
as you would bear your Auditorie in hand that they do.

You mark also the reservation of the holy blood in the holy temple. etc.
Watson can see nothing that makes against him.
But you do not mark that this horrible tumult was made in the time when the
people were together in the ministration of the sacraments. Which does
manifestly appear by the words that are written a little before those that
you cite. The words are these. Ipso magna Sabbato collecta manus militum, ad
vesperam diei in Ecclesias ingressa, clerum omnem qui nobiscum erat, vi eiecit,
and armis gradum vndique muniuit. Mulieres quoque quae per illud tempus se
exuerant, vt baptizarentur: metu grauiorum insidiarum, nudae aufugerunt. Neque
enim concedebatur, vt se velarent, sicut muliers honestas decet. Multae etiam
acceptis vulneribus eijeiebantur, and sanguine implebantur, natatoria, and
sancto cruore rubescebant fluenta. On the very Sabbath day, a great army of
soldiers that were gathered together, entering into the Church at the euentide
of the day, did by force drive out all the ministers that were with us, and
fortify the steps with weapons on every side. Women also, which had at that
time stripped themselves to be baptized: did for fear of greater conspiracies,
run away naked. For they were not suffered to cover themselves, as it
becomes honest women to do. Many also were wounded and driven out, and the
wash Pondes were filled with blood, and the running ryuers were made red with
holy blood.

If you would have considered these words: you might sone have seen how that
most holy blood ye Chrysostom speaks of, might be spilt upon the garments of
the soldiers, and yet not reserved in the temple, for longer time then the
action of Communion did last. For they used not in Chrysostomes church to make
a mornings work of it, as you do use your Easter day Masses: but they
continued the whole day, in prayer, preaching, confession of faith by them that
should be baptized, The manner of Church exercise in Chrysostoms time.
in ministering of baptism, and last of all in communicating al together. But
when you have found a word or two that may seem to serve your purpose: then
have you enough: you lust to seek no further. No wiseman therefore will regard
your conclusion.

Nazianzen Oratione ad Arianos.
Your place that you cite out of Nazianzen, would have framed so evil
fauouredly for your purpose if you had cited it either in Greek or Latin:
that ye thought it best to teach him to speak English: so were you able to
cause him to speak as you would. But you shall not disceyue your hearers so.
They shall hear him speak Latin, in such sort as Bilibaldus taught him. He
says thus to the Arians. Quosnam orantes, and manus ad Deum tollentes obsedi?
Quos Psalmos tubarum strepitu interturbaui? Quorum mysticum sanguinem, caeso
miscui sanguini? Whom have I besieged when they were in prayer, and lifting up
their hands to God? What Psalms have I troubled with the noise of Trumpets?
Whose mystical blood have I mingled, with the blood of the slain? Now, let
your friends judge, how friendly you have taught Nazianzen to speak English,
and how your conclusion does follow upon his words.

But let us see, what it is, that you read in Hierome and other. It seems to
me, that you have read in those Authors: that which you understand not. For who
can believe, that either Hierome or Chrysostom would maintain or teach such a
Paradox, Watsons Paradox.
as you would by their words enforce us to believe? That is, that Christ did
eat his own flesh, and drink his own blood. In the answer that S.
Hierome made to the second question that Hedibia desired to be resolved in: he
says thus. Nec Moses dedit nobis panem verum, sed Dominus Jesus: ipse conuiua
and conuiuium: ipse comedens, and qui comeditur. Moses gave us not the true
bread, but the Lord Jesus: He is the Guest, and the feast also. It is he that
does eat and is eaten. But is here all that Hierome writes in this answer?
Does he leave the matter so doubtful, being desired to make it plain? I trow
not. He says that we do drink the blood of Christ, and yt without Christ we
can not drink it. And that we do daily in his sacrifices, tread out new red
wine, out of the generation of the true vine, and the elected and chosen vine:
and that thereof we do drink new wine in the kingdom of his father, not in
the oldnesse of the letter, but in the newenesse of the spirit, singing a new
song, that none is able to sing, except such as be in the kingdom of the
Church, which is the kingdom of the father. This bread did the Patriarck Jacob
desire to eat, saying: If the Lord God shall be with me, and shall give me
bread to eat, and apparel to cover me withal. And then he concludes his
answer with these words. Quotquot autem in Christo baptizamur: Christum
induimus, and panem comedimus Angelorum, and audimus Dominum praedicantem, Meus
cibus est, vt faciam voluntatem eius qui misit me Patris, vt impleam opus eius.
Faciamus igitur voluntatem eius qui misit nos Patris, and impleamus opus eius:
and Christus nobiscum bibet in Regno Ecclesiae sanguinem suum. So many of us as
be baptized, have put on Christ as a garment, and do eat the food of
Angels: and do hear the Lord preaching thus. My meat, is to do the will of
that father that has sent me, that I may fulfill his work, let us therefore
do the will of that father that has sent us: and let us fulfill his work,
and Christ will drink his own blood with us in the kingdom of the Church.

Now, if you be not obstinate, you must needs confess, that Hierome means
nothing less then to teach that Christ did after such sort as you hold: eat
his own flesh and drink his own blood. But that he did it, by doing the
will of his father, and performing his work.

And Chrysostom also (if you would understand his meaning aright) would teach
you another meaning of Christ's doing, then that which you gather. His words be
these. Chrysostom. in Math. ho. 83.
Hac de causa desiderio desideraui. etc. For this cause have I greatly desired
to eat this passover with you: that I might make you spiritual. He himself
also did drink of the same, least they hearing those words should say. What?
do we drink blood and eat flesh? And should therefore be troubled in mind.
For even when he did before speak of those things: many were offended, even
for the words only. Least the same thing therefore, should happen then also:
he did it first himself: that he might enduce them to be partakers of the
mysteries with a quiet mind. But what? Will you say, that the old passover
was able to do this also? No. For he said do this: that he might lead them
away from that. Furthermore, if this passover do work remission of sins, as
it does in deed: then is the other utterly of none effect. But even as in the
old passover, so in like manner here: he has left us a benefit by gathering
together the memory of the mysteries, and thereby bridling ye mouths of the
heretics. For when they say, how does it appear that Christ was offered, and
many other mysteries: then we alleging these things do stop their mouths. For
if Jesus did not die: whose pledge and sign, is this sacrifice? Thus you see,
what great care he had, that we should always keep in memory: that he died for
us. Thus far Chrysostom in the place yt you cite.

Here it is manifest that Chrysostom goes not about in this place, to teach
that Christ did drink his own blood: but that he did drink of the Cup of the
new passover (which he called his blood, as the Lamb was called the
passover) that his Apostles might not have occasion to think so grossly as
you teach. That is, that he had turned the substance of the Wine into the
substance of his blood, The purpose of Christ in drinking before his disciples.
and would give it them to drink, contrary to the law, which did forbid
them the eating of any thing in the blood thereof. But he did drink thereof
before them: that they might thereby know, that it was not blood but wine,
which he would have them to drink in the remembrance of his death and blood
shedding, as the passover was eaten in the remembrance of the peoples
deliverance in Egypt. And further to bring them from the observing of the old
passover, which was ended in him. And to arm them against those Heretics,
that would deny that Christ died for the sins of the world. That this is
Chrysostomes mind, does plainly appear in those words of his, that I have
before written: taken out of the same Chapter that you cite. As for his manner
of speaking in calling the wine his blood: I have sufficiently written, in the
former part of this answer.

It is plain therefore, that you do open wrong to Chrysostom, in that you
would enforce him to help you to maintain your strange Paradox of Christ's
eating of his own flesh and drinking of his own blood, which I suppose never
any learned or wise man, would maintain as you do.

As for the words that you cite out of Euthymius and Isychius, are
sufficiently answered in this that I have written for answer to that which
you have cited out of Chrysostom. For they both seem to have taken out of
him, all that they write of this matter.

The descant that you make upon this plain song, saying: Descant without good
plain song.
By this fact of Christ we may learn. etc. might well have been spared, till
you had found a better plain song to descant upon. For hitherto you have not
proved that Christ did eat his own flesh and drink his own blood: either
figuratively, spiritually, or really, which you call sacramentally.

And here I must note one pretty point of descant which you do use, when you
say, that if we say that Christ did believe: then it follows that he was not
God. So that by this descant: either Christ must be no man, or else he must be
an Infidel. You are so fearful to fall into the heresy of them yt deny
Christ to be God: that you fall into the contrary, denying him to be man. And
so is the proverb verified in you. Incidit in Scyllam, qui vult vitare
Caribdim. He that is desirous to escape the gulf on the one side: falls upon
the rocks on the other side. But how say you to the words of our savior
Christ, written by saint Mark? Marc. 13. Hebr. 2. and. 4.
De die autem illa vel hora, nemo scit, neque Angeli in caelo neque filius,
nisi Pater. Of that day or hour, no man knows, neither the Angels in
heaven, nor the son, but the father. Christ in his man's nature, must be like
unto us in all points, sin only excepted.

But now, for the real presence of Christ in the sacrament: you have found a
place in Chrysostom, Chrysostom. hom. de Saul and David.
that will not be well avoided, either with figuratively or spiritually: and
therefore you conclude that our best way were, to yield to that which you hold
for truth. etc. But let us consider the words of Chrysostom in that place. He
says thus. Non contigit David. etc. It never chanced to David, to taste of
such a sacrifice. etc. In deed Chrysostom has written all those words that
you report, and in such order as you do write them, saving that to blind the
hearer or reader, you put David in the place of, Illi, least your hearers and
readers should have occasion to think, that there is somewhat going before,
unto which, Illi, has relation. Well, I will let the reader see some of those
words that go before, and some of those that follow: that even your friends
may see and judge, how great a cause you have to think: that our best way
were to yield.

After Chrysostom has begun to paint out the toleraunce of David: not only in
forbearing to revenge himself upon king Saul, but also in seeking to do him
good: he begins to compare him with such as live in the time of the new
testament, and does prefer his tolleraunce before theirs, because he did not
hear and see, that which they have both heard and seen. And thus he says.
Neque enim paria sunt, sub vetere lege degentem, and nunc post illustratam
Euangelij gratiam: talia condonare gratis. Non audierat David parabolam de
december milibus talentorum, neque de centum denarijs. etc. The doings are not
alyke, when one that lived under the old law, and one that lives now, after
the grace of the Gospel is made manifest: do freely forgive such wrongs.
David had not heard the parable of the ten thousand talents, nor of the
hundred pense. He had not heard the prayer which says. Forgive men their
debts: even as your Heavenly Father does forgive your debts. He had not seen
Christ crucified, he had not seen that precious blood poured out, neither had
he heard the innumerable sermons of the Lord, concerning the restrayning of
the lusts of the mind. It happened not unto him to taste such a sacrifice,
neither had he been partaker of the Lords blood. But being brought up under
laws that were not altogether perfect, neither did require any such thing: yet
did he by the moderation of his mind, attain to the highest point of
Evangelical Philosophy. But thou art oftentimes offended, at the remembrance
of the injuries that be past: but this man, although he might stand in fear
of those things that were to come, knowing for certainty that if he would save
his enemy, he should both be banished the City, and lead a poor and
miserable life: yet did he not leave of to be careful for him, but he did all
things that might nourishe this so great an enemy. Who is able to tell us of a
greater toleraunce or forbearing then this?

If figuratively, and spiritually, may not be admitted in these words of
Chrysostom: then let us know, how it can be truly said of him, that he in
his time, they that were before him and after Christ's ascension, and those
that have been since, are now, and shall be to the worlds end: have seen or
shall see Christ's blood poured out, and him crucified. I am sure, you will not
say, that all these under the new testament, have seen or shall see with their
bodily eyes, Christ crucified, and his blood poured out.

Well, then you must give us leave to think, that Chrysostom does use here,
that same figure that saint John does use in the beginning of his first
Epistle. Where he says thus. Chrysostom uses the figure hyperbole in
extolling David's toleraunce.
We declare unto you, that thing that we have seen with our eyes. etc. And why
may we not understand Chrysostom to use the same figure when he says: that
David had not been partaker of the Lords blood? And that it had not happened
him to taste of such a sacrifice. etc.

There was none of the sacrifices of the old law, that did paint out Christ
crucified so plainly, and set him out so lively to our senses, as this
sacrament does: wherefore Chrysostom might well and truly say (without any
figure at all) that it had not happened to David, to taste of such a sacrifice.
Neither did the law and prophets before Christ, so plainly and fully teach
that highest point of christian Philosophy, which David attained unto, as does
the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles: Wherefore Chrysostom might well write
as he does, that David had not heard. etc. And why might not Chrysostom say
then, that David was brought up under laws that were somewhat imperfect, in
comparison of the law of the gospel: although there be in the law it self,
no imperfection at all? The law was perfect, to the end that God did appoint
it for. That was to bring men to the knowledge of their sins, and to drive
them to Christ that was able to take away their sins. And why may not
Chrysostom in this place (according to the common custom of the fathers) call
the sacrament, by the name of that thing whereof it is a sacrament?

But here once again, I must tell you, that the very words that you cite:
are flatly against your half communion. And that if David had been a popish
prince: he should never have dronken the Lords blood, except he would have
been a popish Priest also.

WATSON. Division. 32. August. in Ioannem tract. 11.
And further then this saint Augustine says: Si dixerimus Catechumino, credis
in Christo respondit credo, and signat se cruce Christi, portat in front, and
non erubescit de cruce domini sui: ecce credit in nomine eius. Interrogemus
eum, manducas carnem filij hominis, and bibis sanguinem filij hominis? nescit
quid dicimus, quia Jesus non se credidit ei. If we shall say to one that
learneth and professes our faith being yet not baptized: do thou believe in
Christ? he answers, I believe, and he does sign himself with the cross of
Christ, he bears it on his forehead, and is not ashamed of the cross of his
Lord: Lo he believes in his name. But let us ask him, do thou eat the
flesh of the son of man, and drink the blood of the son of man he can not
tell what we say, for Jesus has not believed and committed himself to him.
Beside other things that may be fruitfully gathered of this place for our
erudition, I note but this one, that a man believing in Christ, professing the
faith of Christ with his word and work, and for that cause eats Christ's
flesh and drinks his blood spiritually, yet he wot not what the eating of
Christ's flesh means, whereof Christ spoke in the sixth of S. John. But we that
be baptized and are admitted to our Lords table: we know by our experience,
what it is to eat Christ's flesh and to drink his blood, for to us Christ
does trust and give himself, to the other that believe as well as we, he does
not commit himself.

Whereby I conclude beside the spiritual eating of Christ by faith, there is
also a real eating of him in the sacrament, by the service of our bodies, to
the confirmation in grace and sanctification both of our bodies and souls.

And concerning the drinking of Christ's blood really, saint Cyprian writes an
other argument, which I think can not be avoided by any figurative speeches,
Cyprian, ser. de caena.
he says thus: Noua est huius Sacramenti doctrina, and sc^olae euangelicae hoc
primum magistereum protulerunt, and doctore christo primum haec mundo inuotuit
disciplina, vt biberent sanguinem Christiani, cuius esum legis antiquae
authoritas districtissime imterdicit. Lex quippe esum sanguinis prohibit,
Euangelium praecipit vt bibatur. etc. Origin also writes this same thing very
plainly upon Numeri. hom. 16. Origin in Numeros hom. 19.
The English is this of Cyprian. The doctrine of this sacrament is new and the
Evangelical school, taught this lesson first of all, this discipline was
never known to the world before our master Christ, who was the first teacher of
it, that christen men should drink blood, the eating of which blood the
authority of the old law does most straightly forbid: for the law forbids
the eating of blood, the gospel commands blood to be droken. etc.

Now this is most certain, that the law did never forbid the drinking of
Christ's blood figuratively, but did command drink offerings, which were
figures of his blood, and the Jews drank of the water that came forth of the
stone, which was a figure of the blood that came forth of Christ's side, which
blood as Chrysostom says is in our Chalice: Id est in calice quod fluxit e
latere, Chrysostom. in 1. Cor. hora. 24.
and illius nos sumus participes: the same thing is the Chalice, that flowed
out of Christ's side, and we are partakers of the same. Nor the law did never
forbid the drinking of Christ's blood spiritually by faith, but set forth the
faith of Christ, being a schoolemaister, to Christ pointing to him, in whom
they should believe and receive all grace.

But to make short, the law forbad the external and real drinking of blood,
which the gospel commands saying, except ye eat the flesh of the son of
man, and drink his blood, ye shall not have life in you, John. 6.
and drink ye all of this. This is my blood of the new Testament. Therefore
it follows necessarily, that the drinking of this blood is not figuratively,
nor yet only spiritually, but really by the service of our bodies, as
Chrysostom says. Si vederit inimicus non postibus imposutum sanguinem typi
sed fidelium ore lucentem sanguinem veritatis Christi templi postibus
dedicatum, Chrysostom. ad Neophytos.
multo magis se subtrahit. If our enemy the Devil shall see not the blood of
the figurative Lamb sprinkled upon the posts, but the blood of Christ the
truth shyning in the mouth of the faithful, much more he will run away. There
is a place of the proverbs which as diverse authors do expound, Proverb. 23.
makes much for the real presence of Christ's body and blood in the sacrament:
the place is this after the Greek, which these authors followed. Cum sederis ad
mensam potentis, sapienter intellige quae apponuntur, and mitte manum tuam,
sciens quia talia te oportet praepare. When thou sit at the table of a
great man, understand wisely what things are set before thee, and put to thy
hand, knowing that thou must prepare such like things again. Saint Augustine
upon saint John, August. in Ioh. tract. 47.48.
and Chrysostom upon the Psalm, and Hesechius and other mo, whose words it
were to long to rehearse in Latin: do expound this place of the proverbs
thus. Who is this great man but Jesus Christ our Lord Gods son: Chrysostom. in
Psalm. 22. Hesichius. li. 6 Capit. 22.
and what is the Table of this great man but where is received his body and his
blood that has given his life for us? And what is to sit at the Table, but to
come to it humbly and devoutly? and what is to consider and understand wisely,
what things be set before thee, but discern the body and blood of Christ to be
set there verily in truth, and to know the grace, virtue, and dignity of them,
and the danger for the misvsing of them? and what is to put to thy hand,
knowing that thou must prepare such like again, but to eat of them knowing
that christen men in the cause of Christ, and defense of the truth are bounden
to shed their blood, and spend their lives for their brethren as Christ has
done the same for us before, the like as we have received at Christ's table his
body and his blood, so ought we to give for our brethren our bodies and blood.

This comparison of taking and giving the like again, auoydeth all the
tryfling cauillations of these figurative speeches, that the simple peoples
heads be combred withal. Here is no place for eating only by faith, for the
martyrs did not only believe in Christ, but also in very deed gave their
bodies and shed their blood really for Christ.

I am weary of telling you of your subtle dealing in cyting sentences out of
the ancient fathers. Saint Austen in the.xj. CROWLEY.
treatise upon John, says as you have cyted: but the words which go before,
and should open saint Austens meaning, August. in Ioh. tract. 11.
you hold from your hearers and readers. He says thus. Ipsis ergo se credit
Jesus, qui nati sunt denuo. Jesus therefore does betake himself to them that
be borne a new. And afterward he says. Qui ergo renati sunt, noctis fuerunt
and diei sunt: tenebrae fuerunt, and lumen sunt. Iam credit se illis Jesus: and
non nocte veniunt ad Iesum sicut Nicodemus, non in tenebris quaerunt diem. etc.
Those therefore, that be borne anewe, did belong to the night, and do now
belong to the day: they were darkness, and are now light. Now Jesus does
betake himself to them, and they come not to Jesus in the night, as did
Nicodemus, they do not seek the light in darkness. etc.

By these words it is plain, that Austen meant nothing less then to teach that
which you gather of his words. Yea, and speaking of the same words that are
written in the sixth of John, he says. Dominus autem exposuit eis, and dixit.
Spiritus est qui viuificat, caro autem non prodest quicquam: cum dixisset. Nisi
quis manducauerit carnem meam, and biberit sanguinem meum, non habebit in se
vitam: ne carnaliter intelligerent. Spiritus est, inquit, qui viuificat, caro
autem nihil prodest. Verba autem quae locutus sum vobis, spiritus and vita
sunt. And the Lord declared unto them and said. It is the spirit that gives
life: the flesh does profit nothing at all: when he had said. Except a man
do eat my flesh and drink my blood, he shall not have any life in himself,
least they should understand him carnally, he said it is the spirit that
quickneth, and the flesh profits nothing. And the words that I have spoken
unto you are spirit and life. etc.

How your conclusion of a real eating of Christ in the sacrament, by the
service of our bodies. etc. may follow upon these words of Austen: I leave to
the judgment of all that be learned, and not obstinately blind in this matter.

Cyprian. Ser. De Caena.
To that which you cite out of Cyprians Sermon De Caena Domini, and Origin upon
the book of Numbers. I refer you for answer, to the words of the same
Cyprian in the same Sermon, where he says thus. Dixerat sanc huius traditionis
magister quod nisi manducaremus and biberemus cius sanguinem, non haberemus
vitam in nobis: spirituali nos instruens documento, and aperiens ad rem ad^^
abditam intellecluin, vt sciremus quod mansio, nostra in ipso, sit manducatio,
and potus quasi quaedam incorporatio, subiectis, obsequijs, voluntatibus
iunctis, affectibus vnitis. The teacher of this tradition had said, that
unless we would eat him and drink his blood, we could have no life in us:
instructing us by a spiritual document, and opening our understanding to a
thing that is so secretly hid, that we might know that our eating is our
dwelling in him, and our drinking as it were a certain joining into one body
with him, by gyuing over our selves wholly to serve him, by joining our wills
to his, and uniting our affections.

And to the words of Origin also in the same Homily that you cite, Origines
in Number. ho. 16.
and not many lines after that which you point at; where he says thus. Bibere
autem dicimur sanguinem Christi, non solum sacramentorum ritu sed and cum
sermonem eius recipimus, in quibus vita consistit, sicut and ipse dicit. Verba
quae locutus sum, spiritus, and vita est. It is said that we drink the blood
of Christ, not only in the rite of the sacrament: but also when we receive his
words, in which life does consist, even as he himself says: The words that I
have spoken, are spirit and life.

Now, let your friends judge what you have gained: by that you have cyted out
of Cyprian and Origin. And for your sentence that you have picked out of
Chrysostom to help out with the matter. August ad Bonifacium. Epist. 23.
I refer you for answer, to that which Austen has written to Bonifacius,
whose words I have cyted in the ninth division of this answer.

But to make short, it appears by this that I have written, that the Gospel
commands no external nor real drinking of blood: wherefore, it is no
necessary consequence, that in the sacrament of Christ's blood, his blood is
not figuratively, nor yet only spiritually dronken, but really by the service
of our bodies: although you do bear us in hand, that Chrysostom does so
affirm, both in his.24. Homily upon the first to the Corinths, and also in his
Homily to those yt were lately graffed into Christ. For both in those places
and many other Chrysostom does give that name to the sacrament, which is
proper to the thing whereof it is a Sacrament, according to Saint Austens saying
to Bonifacius.

As touching the expounding of the words of Solomon, by Austen, Chrysostom
and Isychius, Watson belieth three at once.
I must needs tell you that you belie them all three. For none of them does
say, as you would bear us in hand that they do say. Austen speaks most of
the matter, and says thus. Mensa potentis quae sit nostis, August. in Ioh.
tract. 47.
vbi est corpus and sanguis Christi: qui accedit ad talem mensam, praeparet
talia. Et quid est praeparet talia? Quomodo ipse pro nobis animam suam posuit:
sic and nos debemus, ad aedificandam plebem, ad asserendam fidem, animam pro
fratribus ponere. You know what the table of the mighty man is, where the body
and blood of Christ is, he that comes to such a table, must prepare the like
thing. And what is it to prepare such like things? Even as he gave his life for
us: so must we give our lives for our brethren, to edify the people, and to
defend the faith.

Here is no mention made of the sitting at the table, discerning of the thing
set before them, nor of the putting to of the hand. All that Austen has said
here, Epist. 23.
is fully answered by that which he has written to Bonifacius.

Chrysostom says thus. Sed veniunt ad mensam potentis, Chrysostom. in Psalm. 22.
consyderantes ea quae apponuntur eis accipere cum timore and tremore: and
tribulationes efficiuntur consolationes. But they come unto the table of the
mighty: considering those things that be set before them to receive with fear
and trembling: and their tribulations are become consolations. This is far
from that which you report in his name. But you could not see that which he
writes a little before, Watson can pretend shortness of time, When he will
not say all yt he should.
where he says thus. Et quia istam mensam praeparauit seruis and ancillis in
conspectu eorum. etc. And because he has in the sight of them, prepared this
table for his servant and handmaydens. etc. As is before in the answer to
the.26. division of this sermon. If shortness of time would have suffered you
to rehearse, al those words: they would have marred altogether: and therefore
you did wisely to dissemble them.

As for the place that you cite out of Isychius, it is answered before, and
needs not now to be answered any further. But here I must tell you, that
this is no simple dealing, to urge the interpretation of a few that felowed
the Greek (as you say) both against the text in Hebrew: and the exposition
that such as were learned in the Hebrew tongue, have made upon this place. Yea
and that in so weighty a matter as this is.

You know that Solomon was an Hebrew, and wrote his Proverbs in Hebrew: and
shall we leave his words in Hebrew, and take that which we find in ye Greek
contrary to, or differing from, that which is manifest and plain in the
Hebrew? If Austen had had the understanding of the Hebrew tongue: he would not
have done so. I mislike not the expounding of that text by the Alegorie: for
the text may well bear it. But to Alegorize upon a text, that differs from
the same text in the tongue that it was first written in by the Author thereof:
can not but be misliked. And much more it is to be misliked, August libr. 12.
Confess. Cap. 25.
that any man's private judgment upon any part of scripture, should be made a
sufficient ground to build our faith upon, as the same S. Austen has said.

Saint Hierome, who understood the Hebrew tongue: does Alegorize far
otherwise upon this place. And Lyranus (who was a Jew borne) does expound it
after the letter. And the ordinary Gloss, Hierony. in Prouer. 23.
follows saint Hierome, who understands by the mighty man, the teacher of
Gods word: and by the things set before them, the word of God. etc.

Fearing to be long therefore: you might well have spared all this, and the
applying of your comparison, of taking and gyuing the like again, with
boasting that it auoydeth all the trifling cauillations of figurative speeches.
etc.

WATSON. Division. 33.
I need not stand longer in so plain a matter, although I could allege much
more out of all the ancient fathers, yea and more plainer then these I have
touched, if any can be playner. If I did but tell the bare names of the
sacrament which the aucthors give it. I should prove manifestly, that it were
the very body and blood of Christ, and not bread and wine. Ignatius calls it
Medicamentum immortalitatis, Ignatus ad Ephesios.
antidotum non moriendi a medicine of immortality, a preservative against
death. Dionisius Ariopagita S. Paul's Scholar calls it hostia salutaris, the
sacrifice of our salvation. Dionisius Hier. Eccle. Capit. 3. Justinius Apolo.
Origin in Luc. hom. 38. in Mat. bo. 5. Cyprianus de lapsis de caena.
Justinius martyr says, it is caro and sanguis incarnati Jesus, the flesh and
blood of Jesus incarnate, which names be given to it of the scripture and all
other writers. Origin calls it Panis vitae dapes saluatoris, epulum
incorruptum Dominus, the bread of life, the deynties of our savior, the meat
that is never corrupted, yea our Lord himself. Cyprian calls it Sanctum
domini the holy one of God gratia salutaris, the saving grace, Cibus
inconsumptibilis, the meat that can never be consumed, Alimonia
immortalitatis, the food of immortality. Portio vitae aeternae, the portion
of eternal life, Sacrificium perpes, holocaustum per manens, a continual
sacrifice, an offering always remaining, Christus, yea he calls it Christ.
The great general counsel at Nice calls it Agnus Dei qui tollit peccatum
mundi, Concilium Nicenum.
the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world.

Optatus an old author gives it diverse names, as in this sentence. Quid tam
sacrilegium quam altaria dei frangere, radere, Optatus. li. 6.
remouere in quibus vot a populi and membra Christi portata sunt, vnde a multis
pignus salutis aeternae tutela fidei, and spes resurrectionis accepta est? What
is more sacrilege, then to break the aultars of God (as the Donatistes did) or
to scrape them, or to remove them, upon the which aultars the vows of the
people that is to say, the members of Christ are borne, from which aultars also
the pledge of eternal salvation, the defense and buckler of faith, and the
hope of resurrection be received.

Hilarious calls it cibus dominicus, our Lords meat, Hilarious. li. 8.
Basilius in Missa.
verbum caro, the word made flesh. Saint Basil in his Mass calls them
sancta diuina, impolluta, immortalia, super celestia, and viuifica sacramenta.
Holy sacraments, godly, pure, undefiled, immortal, heavenly, and giving life.
What wittelesse and ungodly man would give these names to bread and wine? Saint
Ambrose calls it gratia dei, Ambrosius de obitu fratris.
the grace of God, not an accidental grace received of God into man's soul,
but the very real sacrament he calls the grace of God, the which his
brother Satirus being upon the sea, and his ship broken, seeking for none other
aid but only the remedy of faith and the defense of that sacrament, took
this grace of God of the priests, and caused it to be bound in a stole, which
he tied about his neck, and so trusting in that committed himself to the
waters, by virtue whereof he escaped drowning, and afterward of a Catholic
Bishop he received that same grace of God with his mouth.

Chrysostom. 1. Cor. 10.
Chrysostom O with what eloquence does he utter this matter: hear but this
one place. Ipsa namque mensa animae nostrae vis est, nerui mentis, fiduciae
vinculum, fundamentum, spes salus lux, vita nostra. The very table says he
(meaning the meat of the table) is the strength of our soul, the sinews of
our mind, the knot of our trust, the foundation, our hope, our health, our
light, and our life. What names, what effects be these? and in an other
Homely he calls it Rex coeli, deus, Christus, Ad Ephe. Ser. 3.
the king of heaven, God himself, Christ, which he says goth into us by these
gates and doors of our mouths. Cyrillus calls it sanctificatio viuifica, the
very sanctification that gives life. Cirillus. li. 4. Capit. 17. August.
Epist. 163.
And S. Augustine calls it Pretium nostrum, the price of our redemption,
which Judas received. What should I trouble you any longer in so plain a
matter? Why should these holy fathers deceive us by calling this sacrament with
so glorious and high names if they meant not so, but that it was but bread and
wine? they lacked no grace that had so much grace as to shed their blood for
Christ's faith, they lacked no wit nor eloquence to express what they meant.
Thus did they with one consent, after one manner always speak and write by
whose plain preaching and writing, the whole world of Christendom has been
persuaded and established in this faith of the real presence these fiftene
hundred yres.

If they have seduced us meaning otherwise then they wrote, then may we justly
say that they were not martyrs and confessors in deed, but very Devils,
erring themselves, and bringing other also into error.

But good people the truth is, they erred not, but taught us as they believed
the very truth, confirming and testifying that faith with their blood that they
had taught with their mouth. And if there be any error, it is in us, that for
the unlearned talking, and witless sophistical reasoning of a few men, will
headlings destroy our souls: forsaking and not contynuing in that faith,
which was taught by the mouth of Christ sealed with his blood, testified by
the blood of martyrs, and has prevailed from the beginning, against the which
Hell gates can not prevail. Now there remains something to be said
concerning the third part which is the consent of the catholic Church in this
point: but I am sorry, the time is so past, that I can not now say any thing
of it, in my next day God wylling I shall touch it, and also proceed in the
matter of the sacrifice, which I hope to God to make so plain, that it shall
appear to them that will see and be not blinded forsaken of God, to be a thing
most evident, most profitable to be used and frequented in Christ's Church, and
that such slanders and blasphemers as be shot against it shall rebound (I
hope) upon their own heads, that shot them to the glory of almighty God,
who by his heavenly providence can so dispose the malice of a few, that it
turn to the stay and commodity of the whole, that the elect by such
conflictes may be awaked from their sleep, may be more confirmed in all truth,
and may be more vigilant and ware in learning and observing the law of God, to
whom be all glory and praise world without end. Amen.

When you have done all that you are able in wresting and wringing of
scriptures and Doctors, CROWLEY.
for the proof of that thing which you say is so plain: then you brag as
though you could do much more, were it not ye the matter is so plain of it
self, that it should be but more then needs, to stand any longer in it. A
good point of Rhetoric: and such as must needs persuade such hearers as
cannot be persuaded, that any of ye Popes Clerks can err.

But you have yet one point of Rhetoric which passes all the rest. And
therefore you have kept it to the last place: that it may leave the stinges and
pricks of eloquence, in the minds of your hearers. If you did but make
rehearsal of the bare names, that the Authors give to the sacrament: you
should prove manifestly, that it were the very body and blood of Christ, and
not bread and wine. And first you begin with Ignatius, who calls it the
medicine of immortality. Ignatius ad Ephesios.
etc. To this I have already answered in the.24. Division of this Sermon: and
therefore need not to trouble the reader with further answer.

Dionisius Areopagita. Eras. contr. Parisienses.
And Dionisius Areopagita calls it the sacrifice of our salvation. This must
needs persuade all your hearers. For this Dionisius was saint Paul's Scholar,
if a man may believe that which you tell us. But Erasmus, and diverse other
learned, and of grave judgment: do think that it could not be that Dionisius,
that wrote the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy. But grant it were eue^ he that is
mentioned in ye Acts: what should it help your purpose that he calls the
sacrament, the sacrifice of salvation? Has not Saint Austen to Bonifacius,
Epist. 23.
told you the reason why such names are given to the sacraments? Yea, does not
the same Dionisius in the same Chapter that you cite, call the same sacrament
by these names: holy bread, and the Cup of blessing, holy signs, comfortable
signs, signs whereby Christ is signified and received, Capit. 3.
most holy signs, heavenly sacraments, holy mysteries. etc? And does he not
call the whole action of the ministration of the same, by the names of
Communion or society, Synaxis or gathering together, and the holy supper: If
that one name be of force, to make it the very body and blood of Christ: then
let the other names be able to make it bread and wine. etc.

Apolog. 2.
Justinius Martyr also, says yt it is the flesh of Jesus incarnate. I must tell
you that you do not report his words aright. He says thus, Jesus Christi, eius
qui homo fastus est, and carnem and sanguinem esse accepimus. We have heard,
that it is the flesh and blood of that Jesus Christ that became man. Not many
lines before, he says. Postea quam and is qui praeest, gratias egit, and
populus omnis benedixit: i^ qui apud nos Diaconi dicuntur, dant vnicuique qui
adsunt, percipiendum Panem, vinum and aquam, quae cum gratiarum action
consecrata sunt, and ad eos qui absunt perferunt. And after that he (which is
the chief) has given thanks, and all the whole people have blessed: those
that with us are called Deacons, do give to every one that is present, bread,
wine, and water, which are by the thanks gyuing consecrated, to be received,
and do carry of the same to those that be absent. I report me to your friends,
whether Justinius meant in this place to teach, or whither it may justly be
gathered of his words: that the sacrament that you speak of is neither bread
nor wine.

Origene is much beholden to you, In Math. homil. 25.
for you teach him to give more names to the sacrament, then he has written in
his Homilies. You note in the margin the fifth Homily upon Matthew, wherein he
speaks not one word of that sacrament. But by like you would have noted
the.25. Homily, where he speaks of it: but far otherwise then you report,
both in words and meaning. And upon Luke, in the place that you note, he says
thus. Nos si tantas Domini nostri opes, In Lucam homil. 38.
tantam sermonis suppellectilem and abundantiam doctrinarum, non libenter
amplectimur, si non comedimus panem vitae, si non carnibus Christi vescimur,
and cruore potamur, si contemnimus dapes Saluatoris nostri: scire debemus quod
habeat Deus and benignitatem and seueritatem. If we do not wyllingly embrace
so great riches of our Lord, so great store of his word, and abundaunce of
doctrine, if we do not eat the bread of life, if we eat not the flesh of
Christ, nor drink his blood, if we despise the delicate dishes of our Savior:
we ought to know, that God has both loving mercy and severe justice. Whether
these words do prove that the sacrament is the very real body and blood of
Christ, and neither bread nor wine: let your holy father the Pope himself be
judge, if he be such a one as has the use of reason.

How the names that Cyprian gives to this sacrament, may prove your
assertion: may well appear, to all such as shall read that which I have
before answered, Cyprian De Caena. Concilium Nicenum.
to that which you have cyted out of his Sermon De Caena.

The great general counsel at Nice, do call it, the Lamb of God. etc. So
do we, so far forth as a sacrament may have the name of that thing whereof it
is a sacrament.

Optatus libro. 6.
Optatus says. Quid tam sacrilegum. etc. What is more sacrilege. etc. Your
old slight must be used still. Such words as may open the meaning of the
writer, must be slyly slipped over. He had to do with Parmenian and the rest of
the Donatists. And in the beginning of his sixth book against them, he writes
thus. Indubitanter liquido demonstratum est: in diuinis sacramentis, quid
nefarie feceritis. etc. Undoubtedly, it is plainly set forth to be seen, what
you have wickedly wrought in the sacraments of God. Now must we show those
things, which you are not able to deny: that you have done cruelly, and
folishly. For what is so great sacrilege, as to break, scrape, and set aside
the aultars of God (upon which you your selves also, did sometime offer) on
which the vows of the people, and the members of Christ are borne: where God
almighty is called upon, and whither the holy ghost being earnestly desired,
does descend or come down: from whence many do receive the earnest of
eternal life, the safegarde of faith, and the hope of resurrection. The
aultars I say, upon which our savior did command, not to lay the offerings
of brotherhood, except the same be seasoned with peace. Lay down says he,
thine offering before the altar, and go thy way back again. Agree with thy
brother, that the priest may offer for thee. For what other thing is the
altar: but the seat of the body and blood of Christ? All these things has
your fury, either scraped, broken, or set aside. Thus far Optatus, against
the Donatists, amongst whom Parmenian was one of the chief.

Saint Austen writing against the same Parmenian: says, that the Donatists
denied all that were not of their sect, Contra Epist. Parmen. li. 1. Capit. 3.
to be of the Church of Christ. And therefore they accounted all the
ministratio^ that was done by any other minister then their own: to be filthy
and abominable. And where they might get the upper hand, they made spoil of
all those things, that served for the ministration. For which doings Optatus
does in this place inueygh against them. And to cause their cruelty and folly
to appear the greater, in breaking, scraping, and removing the communion
tables (which he calls aultars) he gives names of great excellency and
dignity, to those things that were ministered upon those tables: calling the
same, the body and blood, and members of Christ, the earnest or pledge of
everlasting salvation, the safegarde of faith, and the hope of resurrection.
Yea, he says that God is inuocated and called upon there: and that the holy
ghost, being earnestly desired, does descend and come down thither. But you
slip over those words: because the manner of speech that the writer uses
there, is by these words perceived. Watson can slip over some words.
For who knows not that the coming down of the holy ghost, must be
understood to be spiritual: and therefore the manner of speech to be
Hyperbolicall? He says also, that the vows of the people be sustained or
borne upon those tables: whereby he understands the prayers of the people, as
may appear by that which he writes in the same book, where he says thus.
Cur votae and desideria hominum, cum ipsis altaribus confregistis? Illic ad
aures Dei ascendere populi solebat oration. etc. Why have you, with those
aultars dashed in pieces, ye prayers and peticions of men? The prayer of the
people, was wont there to ascend to ye ears of God. Why have you cut down
the way yt the prayers should go up by? And why have ye labored with wicked
hands: in manner to pull away ye ladder, yt the prayer should not have away up as
it was wont to have? And that it is ye communion table which he calls an
altar: it is plain by ye which he writes in the same book also, where he
says thus. Quis fidelium nescit, in peragendis mysterijs, ipsa ligna
linteamine cooperiri. etc. What faithful man is ignorant, that in the
ministration of the sacraments: the timber is covered with a linen cloth?

When you have weighed all this that Optatus has written: you will not (I
trow) make so great reconing of the names that he gives to the sacrament.
Accompting them as sufficient reasons to prove, that the sacrament is the very
body and blood of Christ, and not bread and wine.

Hilarious also, calls it, Cibus Dominicus: Our Lords meat. Hilarious li. 8.
Verbum caro, the word made flesh. I must needs let the readers see the
words of Hilarie: as they stand written in his eight book De irinitate. And
then let him judge how worthy credit you are, that shame not, to snatch such
pieces to prove your purpose. He says thus: Eos nunc qui inter Patrem and
filium, voluntatis ingerunt vnitatem: interrogo, vtrumne per naturae veritatem,
body Christus in nobis sit, an per concordiam voluntatis? Si enim vere verbum
caro factum est, and nos vere verbum carnem cibo dominico sumimus: quomodo non
naturaliter manner in nobis ixistimandus est, qui and naturam carnis nostrae
iam inseparabilem sibi homo natus assumpsit, and naturam carnis suae, ad
naturam aeternitatis, sub sacramento nobis communicandae carnis admiscuit.
Now, I do demand of them that do cast in, or heap upon us, the unity of
will between the father and the son: whether at this day, Christ be in us,
by nature in deed, or by agreement of will? For if the son of God be made
flesh in deed, and we do in the Lords meat, receive the son of God
incarnate in deed: how should he be thought not to dwell naturally in us,
which being borne a man, has both taken unto himself the inseparable nature
of our flesh, and also has myngled the nature of his flesh, with the nature
of eternity, to be communicated unto us under a sacrament.

If we shall understand all these words of Hilarie, so grossly as you would
have us to understand those words that you cite: then shall Hilarie be found
one of those, that affirm the two natures in Christ to be confounded,
contrary to that which all true christians do with Athanasius confess. For
he says, that Christ has mingled the nature of his flesh, with the
eternity, that is, with the divine nature. We must therefore read his words
with favor: as I have noted in that which I have written upon those words
that you cite out of him in the.24. division of this Sermon. Look in the 24.
division.
Being earnestly bent against those heretics that denied the natural unity
betwixt Christ and his father: he speaks a great deal to largely of the
unity betwixt Christ and us, calling that natural also. But for the words
that you cite: we confess all that Hilarie says. That is, that we do in
deed receive in the Lords meat, very Christ, the son of God incarnate: But
not in your gross manner.

Basil in his Mass, calls them, Sancta Diuina. etc. Basilius in Missa.
Holy sacraments, godly, pure, undefiled, immortal, heavenly, and gyuing life.
Of what authority this Mass of Basil is: I refer to the judgment of the
learned. It is not, neither has been followed in any Church, neither is it
found in his works in the Greek. Wherefore it seems to me, to be but a
devise thrust out in his name, by some one that was unborn many years after
Basil was dead. But let it be of as great authority as you would wish it to
be: shall his words that you cite, prove the sacrament to be the body and
blood of Christ, and neither bread nor wine? He calls it but an holy, godly,
undefiled, immortal, heavenly, and quickening sacrament. If you add a minor
proposition, and say: but every such sacrament is the real, and natural body
of Christ: shall we be enforced to conclude, Ergo, this sacrament is the real
and natural body and blood of Christ, and not either bread or wine? I trow
not. I dare refer this to the judgment of them that understand Art.

But is there nothing in that Mass that makes against you? I trow he says
thus. Confidentes appropinquamus sancto altari tuo, and proponentes
configuralia sancti corporis and sanguinis Christi tui: te obsecramus, and te
postulamus saencte sanctorum, beneplacita tua benignitate, venire spiritum
sanctum tuum super nos, and super proposita munera ista, and benedicere ea and
sanctificare. Presuming upon thy mercies, we draw nigh unto thine altar. And
setting before thee, apt figures of the body and blood of thy Christ: we do
pray and beseech thee (O thou holiest of all) that by thy good and merciful
pleasure, thy holy spirit may come upon us, and upon these gifts, which are
set before thee, and that he may bless and sanctify them.

All these words, would your Basil have his high Priest to speak, after the
words of consecration (as you term them) whereby, as much as may be done in
making the body and blood of Christ, is done: and yet the holy ghost must come
upon those gifts, and bless and sanctify them yet more. When you have weighed
these words with the other, then tell me what you have gained toward your
purpose. But when he comes to the distribution, All things reconed, more is
lost then won.
he marreth all: for he says, that they do all communicate. And so, your own
Basil overthrows your private Mass, which may so evil be spared in your
holy fathers Church.

Ambrose calls it Gratia Dei. The grace of God, not accidental. Ambrose De
obitu Fratris.
etc. In mine answer to the ninth division of this Sermon, I have noted of
what authority Erasmus does think those works to be, that are contained in
the third Tome, where these words that you cite, should be. He says that he
is out of doubt, that they be all counterfayted, and set forth in Ambrose name:
for there is no whit of Ambrose vain in them. Besides this, I marvel that
you are not ashamed when you have reported a lie, to dubbe it with another of
your own, saying that Ambrose does call the sacrament by the name of the grace
of God. Were it not for troubling the reader with to much of your folly: I
would let him see the whole fable in writing, and refer the judgment even to
your dearest friends that have not lost the use of their reason.

Chrysostom. in 1. Cor. 10.
But to make up the matter withal: you have sought out one place of
Chrysostom, which does enforce you to cry out and say: Oh with what eloquence
does he utter this matter. Hear but this one place. If a man should ask you
what matter it is that Chrysostom does with such eloquence utter: you must say
the real presence of Christ body and blood in the sacrament, and that the
sacrament is neither bread nor wine. But what one word has Chrysostom in
that place to prove this? His words being taken wholly together, are these.
Quemadmodum frigida accessio periculosa est: ita nulla mysticae illius Caenae
participatio, fames est and interitus. Ipsa namque mensa animae nostrae vis
est, nerui mentis, fiduciae vinculum, fundamentum, spes, salus, lux, vita
nostra. Si hinc hoc sacrificio muniti migrabimus: maxima cum fiducia sanctum
ascendemus vestibulum, tanquam aureis quibusdam vestibus vndique contecti. Et
quid futura commemoro? Nam dum in haec vita sumus: vt terra nobis caelum sit,
facit hoc mysterium. Ascend igitur ad Caeli portas, and diligenter attend.
Imo, non Caeli, sed Caeli Caelorum, and tunc quod dicimus intueberis. For even
as a cold coming to the Lords table is perilous: so not to be partaker of
the mystical supper at all, is famishment and death. For the table is the
strength of our soul, the sinews of our mind, the bond of our confidence or
sure trust, our foundation, hope, health, light, and our life. It we shall
depart hence, being armed with this sacrifice: we shall with great boldness
ascend unto the holy entry, as apparailed on every side, with certain
garments of Gold. And why do I speak of things to come? For even whylst we
be in this life: this mystery does make the earth to be an heaven unto us. Go
up therefore to the gates of heaven: and mark diligently. Yea, not to the
gates of heaven, but of the heaven of heavens: and then thou shall behold those
things that we speak of.

Here you may see, what it is, The end of Chrysostomes Eloquence.
that Chrysostom minds to set forth by this elequence that he uses. He that
will behold the things that he does so highly extol: must in spirit go up to
the gate of the heaven of heavens, even into the third heaven into which saint
Paul was rapt, in which he learned things that he could not utter with his
tongue. The Lords supper, being rightly used of us, does lively set forth unto
us (yea unto our senses,) the Lord Jesus himself, which is the strength of
our soul, the sinews of our mind. etc. This can we not lively see, unless
we do in spirit ascend, to the gate of ye heaven of heavens. etc.

But when you will prove your purpose: then all that the fathers have either
written or spoken, to stir up their hearers or readers to heavenly
contemplation: must needs be plain speeches, and applied to prove your
gross opinion of the real presence of Christ in the sacrament: They must
needs say that they neither use figure, nor spiritual meaning.

And where Chrysostom does in an other Homily call the sacrament by these
names, Rex Caeli, Deus, In Epist. ad Ephesians. ho. 3. Cyril. li. 4. Capit. 17.
August. Epist. 163.
Christus (as you say) The king of heaven, God, and Christ: you may think your
self answered already. And so may you for that which you do here cite out
of Cyrill and Austen.

But I maruayle much that you could not see, what Chrysostom writes against
the staryng and gaseing presence of your good people at your Popish Mass,
wherein your priest does eat and drink up all himself, and gives none any
part with him. Quisquis mysteriorum consors non est (says Chrysostom)
impudens and improbus astat. Whosoever is not partaker of the mysteries: is as
a shameless and wicked man, present at the ministration.

But what should I trouble the reader any longer in so plain a matter? The
fathers have not disceyued you by calling the sacrament of Christ by so
glorious and high names: but you have disceyued your self, by drawing their
figurative and Rhetorical manner of speeches, to plain and grammatical manners
of speaking, and their spiritual meanings, to your carnal and fleshely
meaning.

And as you have disceyued your selves: so you and your Popish fathers have
labored by the brag of fiftene hundred years, to disceyue all the whole
christen world. For which you shall one day drink of the cup of Gods wrath,
except ye repent before ye depart hense. Your, if, and your, but, will not
serve you then. But as you say the error is in your self, which would harken
to the witless sophistical reasoning of a few Popish men, and so run
headlong to destroy your own souls. Forsaking, and not contynuing in that
faith that was taught by the mouth of Christ, sealed with his blood, and
testified by the blood of Martyrs: and has prevailed from the beginning, and
shall continue to the end, in the dispite of Antichrist and all his members
and the whole power of hell.

As for that which remains concerning the third point that causes you to
continue in your Popish faith, that is the consent of the Catholic Church (as
you say) which to your great grief you could not now for shortness of time,
go through with: shall be answered in the answer to your other Sermon, if God
will, I hope in such sort, that as many as be not wilful blind, shall see the
subtlety of your sophistry, and for ever after defy it, and your Popish
Mass also, which you boast to be so profitable to be frequented in the Church
of Antichrist, to maintain your multituds of idle belyes, in cloisters and
else where.

And I doubt not, but whatsoever you or any other, has or shall shoot against
the right use of the Lords supper, which is now in reformed Churches
frequented: shall to the glory of almighty God rebounde into your own
bosoms, to the stay of all such as God in providence, has appointed to be
saved by the preaching of his word. That they never incline to your Popery,
but walk warily in the truth of the christian religion, leading a christian
life: that in the end thereof, they may with Christ triumph over Antichrist
and all his Soldiers in endless felicity. Which he grant to his elect and
chosen children: that in his son Christ, knew them, before they were. Amen.

The second Sermon. Obsecro vos fratres per misericordiam Dei, vt exhibeatis
corpora vestra hostiam sanctam. etc. Romans 12.
AMONG OTHER THINGS the last time I was admitted to speak in this place,
WATSON. Division. 1.
I brought forth this sentence of saint Bernard written in a Sermon De
epithania Pauperes sumus, parum dare possumus. etc. Bernardus Ser. de Epiphania.
The English is this. We be poor, little may we give, yet for that little we
may be reconciled if we will. All that ever I am able to give is this wretched
body of mine, if I give that, it is sufficient, if not then I add his body,
for that is mine and of mine own: for a little one is borne unto us, and the
son is given to us, O Lord that lacks in me, I supply in thee, O most
sweetest reconciliation.

Here I noted a great benefit of the oblation of Christ's body, to consiste in
supplying that lacks in the oblation of our bodies: that where as we being
exhorted of saint Paul to offer up our bodies: a sacrifice to almighty God,
and also do understand by other scriptures, that it is our duties so to
do: which may be done three ways: By voluntary suffering the death for
Christ's faith, if case so require, by painful and penal works, as by
abstinence and other corporal exercises, for the castigation and mortifying of
the outward man, or else by the service of righteousness, in that we use the
members and parts of our body, as instruments of all virtue and godliness,
considering again how there is great imperfection in all our works, and that
the best of us all comes short of that mark, which is prefixed of God to
serve him with all our heart, with all our strength, and that either in the
work it self or in the intent, or in the cause or time, or in some other
degree and circumstaunce: for this cause and consideration saint Bernard does
himself and moves us to join the oblation of Christ's body with ours,
wherewithal we are sure God is well pleased, saying: This is my son, in whom
I am well pleased, Mark. 7.
by whose merits our oblation and other works do please God, and not
otherwise.

CROWLEY.
This place of Bernard is answered, in the seventh division of the former
Sermon, whereunto I refer the indifferent reader.

And therefore I purposed to make one sermon of the sacrifice of Christ,
WATSON. Division. 2.
not of that which he himself made upon the cross for our redemption, but of
that which the Church his spouse makes upon the altar, which purpose being
also before promised, remains now to be fulfilled.

And entering the last time to speak of it, I laid this foundation, that is to
say, the verity of the blessed Sacrament, the body and blood of our savior
Christ to be verily and really present in it by the omnipotent power of
almighty God, and the operation of his holy spirit assisting the due
administration of the Priest, and so to be there not only as our meat, which
God gives unto us, to nourish us in spiritual life, but also as our sacrifice
which we give and offer unto God to please him and purge us from such things
as may destroy or hinder that spiritual life, seeing that Christ himself is
the substance of the sacrifice of the new Testament, as I have partly showed
before, and beside him we have none, that is only proper to us Christen men.

This foundation of the real presence I presupposed to have been believed of us
all, and yet I did not so rawly leave it, but declared unto you such reasons,
as moved me to continue still in that faith I was borne in, which were the
evident and plain scriptures of God, opened with the circumstances of the
places in such wise, as the vain cauillations of the sacramentaries can not
delude them, and also the effects of this sacrament, which be so great and so
wonderful, that they can be ascribed to no other cause, but only to almighty
God, and to such creatures, as Gods son has joined unto him in unity of
person, as be the body and blood of our savior Christ. I alleged also the
sayings of the holy fathers, not in such number as I would have done but
choosed out a few, which not only declared the Authors faith, but contained a
necessary argument to prove our common faith in this matter.

For answer to your handling of those matters that you speak of here:
CROWLEY.
I refer the reader to the answer that I have made to that Sermon.

Concerning the third point, WATSON. Division. 3.
which is the consent of the catholic Church, neither the time then suffered to
speak as behooved, nor yet suffers now, if I should perform my promise, as
I intend God wylllng. And for that cause I shall but move you to consider
certain things, whereby the consent may appear.

First the possession of the Church, in this doctrine so many years in such
quietness without contradiction, that no reason or yet iniunction, nor no new
devise that the Devil or his dearlings can invent to the contrary, either can
or ought to remove us out of possession, except we will wilfully loose our
own right and claim, seeing that we that live now universally throughout all
Christendom have received this faith of our fathers, and they of theirs,
Cyprian. Ser. De Caena.
and so forth even to the Apostles and our savior Christ himself, by whose
mouth this doctrine (as saint Cyprian says) was first taught to the world,
that Christen men in the new law be commanded to drink blood, which the
Jews in the old law were forbid to do.

And so from him and his Apostles it has been by succession deduced and
brought throughout all ages, even to this our time, and believed as Gods word,
which can not be changed, and not as man's word, subject to alteration, as
probability can persuade.

CROWLEY.
The first of those certain things that you move your Auditorie to consider,
whereby the consent of the Catholic Church may appear: is prescription of
time. To this I have partly answered, in the answer to your former Sermon.
And the Bishop of Sarisburie has fully answered, in his answer to Doctor
Harding. And here I answer in few words. That your possession has been
forcible, your fathers faith in this point, a false persuasion, beside the
word of God, and your claim altogether unjust, and therefore justly
withstanded by us, to whom the right belongs, as by good evidence of Gods
holy word and judgment of sound writers, we both have and shall prove, by
Gods help.

WATSON. Division. 4
Secondly, this consent in this matter may appear by that the holy fathers and
pastors of Christ's Church have written of it, whom god has placed and
planted in his Church for the buylding and upholding of it in truth, that his
flock be not seduced and carried about with every blast of new doctrine by the
craftines of men, to the destruction of their souls. Of this I have spoken
something already.

CROWLEY.
The indifferent reader, may easily perceive in the answer that I have made to
your former Sermon: how well those fathers and pastors that you speak of,
do maintain that which you do teach: Even as those that fight against you
with all the knowledge they have. And whatsoever you have already spoken
therein: is in the place where you have spoken it, already fully answered.

WATSON. Division. 5.
Thirdly, we may know the consent of the Church by the determination of the
general counsels, where the presidents of Gods Churches, and the rulers and
learned priests of Christendom, assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ representing the holy Church of God Militaunt, being led not with
private affection but by Gods holy spirit to his glory, instaunt in prayer,
fervent in devotion, purely, diligently, and freely have entreated and
determined those things, that perteine to the faith of Christ, and the purging
of his Church, to whose determination as to Gods ordinances we are bound to
obey. Wherein appears manifestly the consent of the Church.

How the determination of the general counsels, CROWLEY.
does declare the consent of the Church, and how purely, diligently, and
freely, they entreated and determined those things that you speak of, in these
general counsels: shall plainly appear to the indifferent reader, in the
answer that shall be made to all such sentences as you shall cite out of any
general counsel, in order as the same shall be cited.

The first general counsel both for the calling, WATSON Division. 6.
Concilium Nicenum.
and also for the cause, was holden at Nice in Bithinia, by.318. Bishops in the
time of Constantinus Magnus twelve hundred and thirty years ago, where it was
determined and published to the world in these words. Exaltata mente, fide
consideremus situm esse in sancta illa mensa agnum dei qui tollit peccatum
mundi, quia sacerdotibus sacrificatur sine cruoris effusione, and nos vere
preciosum illius corpus and sanguinem sumentis credere haec esse resurectionis
nostrae symbola. etc. Let us lift up our minds, understanding and considering
by faith, that the Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world is
situate and lies upon that holy table, which is offered of the pristes without
the shedding of blood, and that we receiving verily his precious body and
blood, do believe them to be the pledges or causes of our resurrection.

This authority serves me very well to declare the consent of the Church both
in the matter of the real presence, and also of the sacrifice, which we have
in hand. For the words be touched maruellously, every one serving to express
the truth, and to avoid all doubts.

For first he bids us, lift up our minds, and consider by faith, wylling us
not to stick only to our senses, thinking nothing else to be there, but what
we see outwardly, teaching us that the judgment of this matter perteyneth not
to our senses, but to our faith only, and as Eusebius Emesenus says. Vere
vnica and perfecta hostia fide aestimanda non specie nec exterioris censenda
est visu hominis, Emesenus orat. de corpore Christi.
sed interioris affectu. This host and sacrifice is verily one and perfect, to
be esteemed by faith, and not by form and appearaunce, to be judged not by
the sight of the outward man, but with the affection and persuasion of the
inward man: for to faith only and not to senses apperteyneth the knowledge
and judgment of Gods mysteries and sacraments.

Then the counsel declares what faith teaches, that is to say, that the
Lamb of God not material bread and wine nor the figure of the Lamb, but the
Lamb that takes away the sin of the world, is placed lying upon the holy
table of the altar, which external situation proves a real presence of
Christ to be there before we receive it, and not a fantastical or an
intellectual receiving of Christ by faith in the time of the receiving only,
as these men contend.

Further it teaches, that this Lamb of God is offered to almighty God by the
Priests, which is a distinte offering from that Christ made upon the cross,
for there he offered himself by shedding his blood, which he did but once,
and never shall do it again any more.

Here is he offered of the priests, not by shedding of blood, but as the
counsel says (...) not after a bloody manner, which is not a new kylling of
Christ, but a solemn representation of his death, as himself has ordained.

After this it declares the receiving of it saying, that we verily receive his
precious body and blood, which word (verily) is as much as that we call
(really) and declares the use of the sacrament in the receypt of it with the
service of our mouth, Math. 19.
as Christ commanded saying: Take, eat which is a corporal eating, not a
spiritual believing.

And last of all it shows the effect of the sacrament, which is the
resurrection of our bodies to eternal life, for because Christ's body being
the body of very life, is joined to our bodies, as our food: it brings our
bodies that be dead by sentence of death to his property which is life,
whereof in my last sermon I spoke more at large.

O Lord what hard hearts have these men to doubt themselves, or to deny or
to bring in question that manifest open truth in so high and necessary a
matter, which in most plain words has been taught of our savior Christ his
Apostles and Evangelists, and declared so to be understand by the holy ghost
out of the mouths of all these holy fathers, whom the holy ghost did
assemble and inspire with the spirit of truth, to the confusion of the great
heretic Arius, that troubled the world then, and also did inspire their
hearts to declare so plainly the mystery of this blessed sacrament, which
then was without all contention, believed of al christen men, only to prevent
these heretics that arise and spring up now in these latter days, that the
world may see, how they strive against the known truth, their own conscience
and the determination of the hole church, being enemies of God, breaking his
peace, and dividing themselves from the church, whose end is eternal confusion.

Now are you come to the first general counsel, CROWLEY.
holden at Nice, in the City of Bithinia, under Constantinus Magnus. In
the.24. division of your former Sermon: I have said some thing to the later
words of this sentence that you cite out of the great general counsel of
Nice. And in the.33. division of the same sermon: I have granted as much, as
the words yt you cite there do teach, when they be understood so, as ye
ancient fathers do use yt like manner of speeches. But here I must tell you
that in the old allowed counsel of Nice: there is no part of that which you
rite here found written. Wherefore, ye authority thereof: must needs be so much
the less. But grant that the.318. Bishops, had in that counsel agreed and
written, even as you have cited: must we therefore believe, that Christ is in ye
sacrament in such sort as you teach, really and substantially. etc.

Saint Austen, in his Sermon Ad Infantes, which is cyted by Beda, Beda in 1.
Cor. ca. 10.
says thus. Vos estis in mensa, vos estis in Calice. You are upon the table,
you are in the Cup: shall we therefore say, that saint Austen meant, that those
persons that he spoke unto, were really, substantially and bodily, in the cup
and on the table? I think you will not grant it. And why will you by the
words cyted out of the Nicene counsel, bind us to believe: that Christ is
after such sort present in the sacrament?

As touching the marvelous touching (or couching) of the words (for so I
suppose you spoke) I can not but marvel, that you could not see, how every
one of them, serves to express the truth against that which you teach. First,
they will us to lift up our minds and to consider by faith, not things that
are here conuersaunt amongst us, and may be conceived by bodily senses: but
that are above, and can not be conceived otherwise then by faith. Then they
tell us, that the Lamb of God is set upon the holy table (even as saint Austen
tells his Auditorie, that they are set upon the table) to teach us, that the
sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, is not a bare and naked sign, but
effectual to the worthy receyuer, that is to such as being members of Christ,
are placed on the table and in the cup with Christ, in such sort as the Lamb
of God is placed there, that is spiritually and in a mystery. And after the
same sort, the same Lamb is sacrificed by the priests: when by their
ministry, the members of Christ be made partakers of that holy mystery, and
do even sensibly feel the effect of that sacrifice, Hebr. 9.10.
which that Lamb made of himself once for all, as saint Paul writes.

Thirdly, they declare, that we receiving the precious body and blood of Christ
in deed: do believe that it is the pledge of our resurrection. Which manner of
receiving, it pleases you to term, a real receiving. As though the body of
Christ could not be received by faith verilye and in deed, unless the same
be after your real manner.

But I must put you in mind, that you have fowly forgotten your self, when you
say that the offering that the priest makes in his Mass, is a distinct
offering from that which Christ made upon the cross: for you shall find many
of your friends of a contrary mind, if ye search their books well. But you
would seem to make bloody, and unbloody, the difference between those two
sacrifices. Here say you (that is in your Mass) he is offered of the priests,
not by shedding of his blood, but (...) that is, insacrificabiliter, after an
vnsacrificable manner, which is not a new kylling of Christ, but a solemn
representation of his death, as himself has ordained. Here the latter words
do confute the first. For if the manner of offering in the Mass, be such as can
not be a sacrifice: how can the Mass be a sacrifice? And if the Mass be but
a solemn representatio^ of the death of Christ: how can it be a sacrifice
offered to almighty God?

Not the Popish Mass, but the blessed supper of the Lord, the holy communion
of his body and blood, is a lively representation, of his death and passion.
And as your Emesenus says in the words that you cite (for you have taught him
to speak congrue latin now) vere vna and perfecta hostia etc. That sacrifice
which is but one, and is perfect in deed: must not be esteemed by outward
show, nor judged by the sight of the outward man, but by faith and the
affection of the inward man. But either not understanding your Emesenus his
words, or else (after your old custom) of purpose, you corrupt him in the
translation. For you say. This host and sacrifice, is verily one and perfect,
as though Emesenus had poynted to your Mass sacrifice. Where as it is plain,
that he means of that sacrifice, that is represented by the holy communion of
the body and blood of Christ.

I may therefore use the words of your own exclamation against your self,
and such as be of your mind. For whose hearts can be imagined to be more hard
then youres: which in so manifest a matter as this, do not only, bring in
question, the open and manifest truth, but also in alleging ye words of
fathers and counselles, apply them for your purpose, contrary to their
meaning? seeing Christ himself, his Apostles and Evangelists, the ancient
fathers and counsels: have in most plain words, taught the contrary of that
which you defend. It is manifest therefore, that you stryuing against the
known truth, your own consciences and the determination of the whole Church
are enemies to God, breakers of his peace. And deuyding your selves from the
Church, must needs in the end come to confusion everlasting, unless ye
repent in time.

WATSON. Division. 7. Concilium Ephesians. Epist. ad Nestor.
Likewise the next general counsel holden at Ephesus, in the time of
Theodosius the Emperor, eleventh hundred and twenty years ago, does determine
this truth likewise in these words. Necessario igitur and hoc adijcimus.
Annunciantes enim sicut secundum carnem mortem vnigeniti filij Dei, id est,
Jesus Christi and resurrectionem eius, and in caelis ascensionem pariter
confitentes, incruentum celebramus in Ecclesijs sacrificij cultum, sic etiam ad
misticas benedictiones accedimus, and sanctificamur participes sancti corporis
and preciosi sanguinis Christi omnium nostrum redemptoris effecti, non vt
communem carnem percipientes (quod absit) nec vt viri sanctificati and verbo
coniuncti secundum dignitatis vnitatem, aut sicut diuinam possidentis
habitationem, sed vere vinificatricem and ipsius verbi propriam factam. We add
this also necessarily: We showing and declaring the corporal death of Gods
only begotten son Jesus Christ, and likewise confessing his resurrection and
ascension unto heaven do celebrate the unbloody oblation and sacrifice in our
Churches, for so we come to the mystical benedictions, and are sanctified
being made partakers of the holy body and precious blood of Christ, all our
redeemer not receiving it as common flesh (God forbid) nor as the flesh of an
holy man, and joined to the word of God by unity of dignity, nor as the
flesh of him in whom God dwells, but as the flesh only proper to Gods
son and verily giving life to the receauer.

By this determination of this general counsel, we learn that in the
mystical benediction (by which word is meant this blessed Sacrament) we
receive Christ's own proper flesh, and of it we receive sanctification and
life, before the receypt whereof we celebrate the unbloody sacrifice of the
same in our Churches, declaring our Lords death, resurrection, and ascension,
and by this place we plainly perceive that the doings and words which be
used daily in our Mass, were also used in the time of this counsel much
above a thousand years ago.

By the words of the Ephesian counsel, CROWLEY.
you would not only prove the real presence in the sacrament: but also that
the same Apishe toys that be now used in the Popish Mass, were then used,
which was within.468. years after Christ. But the Popes own hystories do
plainly declare: that the greatest number of those things, were not as then
invented.

But to frame the matter somewhat better to your purpose: you help it a little
in writing out the words. For in the place of Sacrificij seruitutem: you
write, Sacrificij cultum. Supposing belyke that the base Epitheton of
servitude: would abate somewhat, the high estimation that you would your Mass
should have. Well, let that pass. It is no fault, in men of your sort. But
let us see how this place may prove the real presence of Christ in the
sacrament.

The Authors of this Epistle, would bring Nestorius, then Bishop of
Constantinople back again from his error: which was, that of the Virgin
Marie, was borne only the manhood of Christ, and not Christ God and man. So
that he divided Christ into two persons: one divine, and another humane. And to
prove that the manhood in Christ, is joined with the Godhead in unity of
person: these Bishops do in this part of their Epistle, join to the
confession of their belief concerning the corporal death, resurrection, and
ascension of our savior into heaven, the celebration of the remembrance of
his death, which they call Incruentam sacrificij seruitutem, the unbloody
service of the sacrifice. And to make their meaning more plain: they say that
they come to the mystical benediction, and be made holy, when they be made
partakers of the holy body and precious blood of Christ, the redeemer of all.
Not receiving the same as common flesh, or as the flesh of an holy man, or of
a man that is joined to the son of God by the unity of dignity, or that
possesses the heavenly habitation: but as flesh that has power to give life
in deed, and is become the peculiar and proper flesh of the son of God
himself. For (say they) he that is life, as being God, because he is united to
his own flesh, has declared the same to be of force to give life. etc. These
words indifferently weighed, do prove, that the manhood in Christ is joined
to his divine nature, in unity of person: but that the same manhood is really
present in the sacrament, and therein offered up in sacrifice, can not be
proved by these words.

August. ser. De sacramentis fidelium.
Yea, these words do very well agree with the doctrine of Saint Austen when
he says thus. Qui non manet in Christo, and in quo Christus non manet:
proculdubio, nec manducat eius carnem, neque bibit eius sanguinem, etiamsi
tantae rei sacramentum, iudicium sibi manducet and bibat. Who so abides not in
Christ, and in whom Christ abides not: without doubt, he does neither eat
his flesh nor drink his blood, although he do to his own condemnation, eat
and drink the sacrament of so worthy a thing.

And again he says. Huius rei sacramentum, id est vnitatis corporis and
sanguinis Christi, alicubi quotidie, alicubi certis interuallis dierum, in
Dominico praeparatur, and de mensa Domini sumitur, quibusdam ad vitam,
quibusdam ad exitium. Res vero ipsa cuius est sacramentum: est omni homini ad
vitam, nulli ad exitium, quicunque eius particeps fuerit. The sacrament of this
thing, that is, of the unity of the body and blood of Christ, is in some
places prepared every day, in some place in certain distance of days, in the
Lords day: and is received at the Lords table, to life in some, and to
destruction in some other. But the thing it self whereof it is a sacrament, is
life to every man that is partaker thereof, and destruction to none.

So the Fathers of the Ephesian council, have very well confessed: that
coming to the mystical benediction, and being made partakers of the holy body
and blessed blood of Christ, they are sanctified and made holy, by that
quickening flesh of Christ, which being joined to his Godhead in unity of
person, is of power to give everlasting life, to as many as shall be partakers
thereof, by dwelling in Christ, as saint Austen has taught.

I conclude therefore, that you have alleged the words of the Ephesian
Council, contrary to the true meaning of the Fathers that were gathered
together in that Counsel. And that it helps you nothing at all, that that
Counsel was holden so long ago.

This doctrine also was determined in the general counsel holden at
Constantinople in the time of Justinian the Emperor the year of our
Lord.552. WATSON. Division. 8. Concilium Constanti. in Trul. cap. 102.
where be written these words. Omni sensibili creaturae supereminet is qui
salutari passione coelestem nactus dignitatem, edens and bibens Christum ad
vitam aeternam perpetuo coniungitur, and anima and corpore diuinae
participatione gratia sanctificatur, and so forth.

He far excels every sensible creature, that by the passion of our
savior obteyning heavenly dignity, eating and drinking Christ, is continually
joined to eternal life, and is sanctified both in soul and body by
participacion of the heavenly grace.

This place is notable declaring the dignity of him that eats Christ, and
the effect of that eating to be everlasting life and sanctification, both of
body and soul.

You have a great grace in setting the visoure of antiquity, CROWLEY.
upon matter nothing ancient. Watsons grace in the brag of antiquity.
This matter must needs be bolstred out with the big title of the counsel
of Constantinople, holden in the time of Justinian the Emperor. etc. And yet
in that whole counsel (as the same has been of any antiquity set forth in
writing) there is not any one word that may be wrested to such meaning as you
allege this place for. But in ye mergine you note that you find it in the
counsel holde^ in Trullo, Capi. 102. I suppose that is as much as if you had
said, that Ecchius, Pighius, Hosius, or some of the ancient Catholics that
lived about the year of our Lord.1550: Words cited not found in the place
noted.
have reported that this doctrine was agreed upon in the fifth general Counsel
for the sentence that you cite is not to be found, either there or in the
counsel holden in Trullo. But grant yt the fathers of the counsel had
concluded in such words as you cite: what should it help your cause? you have
taken upon you to prove: that Christ is really and substancially present in the
sacrament. And to prove this, you say that the fathers of the Counsel have
determined, that who so has by the suffering of Christ, obtained the heavenly
dignity, and does eat and drink Christ: the same being more excellent then
all sensible creatures, is continually joined to eternal life, and is
sanctified both in soul and body, Watson cyteth words that prove the
contrary of his assertion.
by the participation of the grace of God. Do these words prove your
purpose? Or do they not rather prove that no wicked man does eat and drink
Christ? for none can truly be said to excel all sensible creatures, and to
be continually joined to life eternal, and to be made holy both in soul and
body: but such only as be by Christ advanced to the heavenly dignity, yt is
to say, be made members of Christ, children of God, and inheritours of the
kingdom of heaven. But no wicked reprobate is such one: wherefore none such
does eat or drink Christ in the sacrament. So well do your friends in the
council holden in Trullo, help you to prove your purpose.

WATSON. Division. 9. Concilium Lateranense.
Likewise the general counsel called Lateranense, holden at Rome the year of
our Lord. 1215. determined this matter in the same terms, that we express it
now. Vna est fidelium vniuersalis Ecclesia, extra quam nullus omnino saluatur,
in qua idem ipse sacerdos and sacrificium Jesus Christus, cuius corpus and
sanguis in Sacramento altaris sub speciebus panis and vini veraciter
continentur, transubstantiatis pane in corpus and vino in sanguinem potestate
diuina. There is one universal church of all faithful people, without the
which no man is saved at any time, in the which Jesus Christ him self is both
the priest and the sacrifice, whose body and blood be truly contained in the
sacrament of the altar under the form of bread and wine the bread being
transubstanciate into his body, and the wine into his blood by the power of
God.

This form of doctrine after this sort, and in these terms has been taught,
professed, and believed throughout the whole catholic church ever since that
time, howsoever some Heretics forsaking their faith, proceeding from Gods
omnipotent word and the unity of his Church, and leaning to their
sensuallitie and blind reason against faith have repined and barked against
the same. But I put no doubts but by gods grace, if the time would suffer me:
to make this matter of transubstantiation as plain as the other of the real
presence.

It seems to me a strange thing, CROWLEY.
that you which brag of uniform consent of the Church fiftene hundred years
before this day, do now produce witness that is not yet.400. years old,
Decrees made by Pope Innocent: do not prove things done. 1200. years before
his days.
and would have the world to think, that because Pope Innocent the third has
decreed the transubstantiation of bread and wine, and the real presence of
Christ's body and blood in the sacrament: therefore it must needs be believed
to be so now, and to have been so ever since the first institution of the
sacrament. But in the aunsweres that I have made to the matter of greater
antiquity produced by you, in your first sermon and in the former part of this
your second sermon: it does sufficiently appear to the indifferent reader,
that you neither have made plain the matter of the real presence, nor are
like to make plain the matter of transubstantiation, though you take as much
time thereto, as you have now to live.

I will not stick to grant you, that this counsel of Lateranense did determine
this matter according as you have said: but what is that to the purpose you
have in hand? for in the days of the third Innocent: the Church of Rome was
as far from the sincerity of christen religion, as it is now. And what does
that determination that they made of this matter, prove against us: that stand
in the defense of the sincerity that was in the primative Church? I put no
doubts therefore, but I shall be able to answer all that you shall be able to
say for your transubstantiation. As I have been able to answer all that you
have produced for the matter of the real presence.

The general counsel also of Constance, holde^ of later days, WATSON.
Division. 10.
the year of our Lord. 1451. does agree and testify the same, Concilium
constantiense.
in that they condemned John Wyclefe the heretic and all his errors against
this blessed sacrament.

Thus have I showed you the consent of the Church by the determinations of the
general counsels. It shall not be needful to rehearse any particular and
provincial counsels, which all in this doctrine agree with the other general.

CROWLEY.
Your great antiquity is well abated: when you fall from 1500. years, to less
then 150. You were best to furnish out your number of witnesses, with the
general counsels that have been holden since Constance, and the sayings of
those ancient fathers that have written within these hundred years. And then
you may safely say that you shall not need to make rehearsal of the
particular and provincial counsels, which are all even such as the times were
wherein they were holden.

How justly that counsel of Constance did condemn Wickliefe and his doctrine:
How iustlye Wyckliefe was condemned.
I refer to the judgment of such as shall or have read his works, or that
which John For has reported in his monuments of Martyrs.

WATSON. Division. 11.
Furthermore, the consent of the Church appears by the condemnation of the
heretics of all ages, which hold any false opinion in any point against the
verity and the institution of Christ, concerning this blessed sacrament.

The first heretic that ever we read of in this matter, and father to all the
sacramentaries that live now, was one in the time of Ignatius, by and by after
the Apostles, whose name we know not, but what he and his sect that followed him
did Theodaretus in his third Dialogue makes mention, saying that Ignatius
(who lived within one hundred year of Christ) writes in an Epistle Ad
Smyrnenses in these words. Eucharistias and oblationes non admittunt,
Theodoretus Dialogo. 3. Ignatius ad Smyrnenses.
eoque non confiteantur Eucharistiam esse carnem seruatoris nostri Jesus
Christi, quae pro peccatis nostris passa est, and quam pater sua benignitate
suscitauit.

They do not allow and admit our sacrament and offerings, because they do
not confess the sacrament (called Eucharistia) to be the flesh of our
Savior Jesus Christ, which flesh suffered for our sins, and which the
fathers goodness did raise from death again.

By this we learn, what was the faith in the primitive Church, both that the
sacrament was the very flesh of Christ, which suffered for us, and also that
it was offered for us by the priests, which things those heretics denied then,
as their scholars now springing up upon their ashes deny now, and that they
were condemned as heretics by the primitive Church then, as these most
worthily be condemned by the catholic Church now.

The consent of the Primative Church appears in the condemning of heretics,
CROWLEY.
that then brought in heresies and sowed scismes: and the consent of the same
Church of Christ, The Church of Christ does always condemn heresies.
has ever since (as the Church of Antichrist would suffer it) showed forth her
consent therein, and does now more manifestly, then heretofore it could be
suffered to do.

But your Antichristian Church, although it have for a fashion (to get her a
good name) condemned some heresies, although not any such as you say: yet has
it brought in, received and confirmed, Antichrists Church confirms as great
heresies as it does condemn.
as many and as great as it has condemned. As the supremacy and universal
power of her head the Pope, the power to pardon sins in this life and after,
the power to forbid meats and marriage, the sacrifice for sin, the
transubstanciation of bread and wine. etc.

And here I must tell you, that your friend Master Doctor Harding, does not
agree with you about the first founder and father of the sacramentarie heresy.
You say, that it was one that sprung up by and by after the Apostles: but your
friend Harding says, that Beringarius, a thousand year after, was the first
that ever impugned the truth of the article of Christ's real natural and
corporal presence in the sacrament. Well, agree you two as you can: I will not
seek to set you at one in this point.

But as touching that you cite, Theodoretus, affirming that Ignatius did in his
Epistle to the Christians in Smyrna, write of that namelesse man and his
folowers: Ignatius his words not found in his Epistle.
I must let you understand, that in that Epistle which is extant in the Greek,
written by Ignatius to the Smyrnians, there is no such sentence as Theodoretus
does note. And what should it help your cause, if Ignatius had written even
so? Or if there were some other Epistle of Ignatius to them, wherein those
words might be found: should that prove your purpose? Ignatius has said that
those heretics did not admit thanks giuings and oblations: because they
confess not that the Eucharist or thanks gyuing, is the flesh of our savior
Jesus Christ. etc. But we do admit both the Eucharists and oblations, and do
confess that the same is the flesh of Christ. etc. Wherefore this place can
prove nothing against us. Again, here is no mention of real, natural, and
substantial presence. etc. Therefore it makes nothing for you.

But I do much marvel, that you could not see a sentence that the same
Theodoretus cyteth out of ye same Epistle: Theodoretus Dialogo. 2.
which is also found in ye Epistle which is extant in Greek. The words of the
sentence are these. Quando ad eos qui cum Petro erant accessit, dixit eis:
accipite, palpate me, and videte quod non sum Demonium incorporeum. Et protenus
ipsum tetigerunt, and crediderunt. When he came unto them that were with Peter,
he said unto them: take me and feel me, and understand that I am not a
Devil that has not a body. And forthwith they touched him and believed.
Whether these words of Ignatius, may stand with such a real presence of
Christ's body in the sacrament as you teach: I refer to the judgment of as
many as be learned, and not obstinate blind.

Ignatius does teach none other faith then we do.
Wherefore, I conclude: that the words of Ignatius do not teach us any other
faith then that which we hold. Which is, that the sacrament is the very body
and blood of Christ, which suffered for our sins, and rose again for our
justification: but not after your real, carnal, and gross manner. Neither do
the words of Ignatius give us occasion to think that Christ's body is, or
can be so present in many places at once, and insensibly as you and your sort
do teach, and condemn other for denying the same.

And where as the due matter, WATSON. Division. 12
wherein this blessed Sacrament is consecrated, ought to be unleavened bread of
wheat and wine mixed with water, according to the scriptures and the example
of Christ: there were one sort of heretics called Artotoritae, (of whom
speaks Epiphanius contra Quintillianos) which were so called for that they
used not in their sacrifices the necessary and due matter, Epiphanius contra
quintillianos.
but in their mysteries did consecrate, and offer bread and Cheese.

An other sort of heretics were called Fermentarij, because they did
consecrate in leauened bread, Consilium Basiliense.
as our men of late did command to be done, who were condemned by the
general counsel at Basil.

Other were called Aquarij, or Hydroparastae, for that they pretending
sobriety, Cyprian lib. 2. Epistola. 3. Chrysostom. in Math. hom. 83.
did consecrate in water only without wine, against whom writ saint Cyprian,
Chrysostom, and other, who also were condemned by the general counsel of
Constantinople. In trullo. cap. 32.

Other were called Armenij, who in their sacrifices consecrated and offered
wine only without water, Theophilactus in Joan. Capit. 19.
against whom writes Theophilactus, all these held false opinion against the
necessary and due matter of the Sacrament.

Now you have found out certain sorts of heretics, CROWLEY.
that erred about the due matter, wherein the blessed sacrament is consecrated.
The first be Artotoritae. The sacrament ministered in bread and cheese.
These ministered with bread and cheese. Bilike they were Walshmen. I trust you
will not charge us with this error. Another sort were called Fermentarij. etc.
Of this sort we must needs be. For not long before you preached this Sermon. We
commanded that the sacrament should be ministered in leauened bread. A man
might maruayle, how you became so far past shame: that you durst in so
honorable an Auditorie, make so open a lie. The words of the law that was in
king Edwardes days and is now, are these. Communion bread.
To taks away the superstition that has been in that kind of bread that has
been used in the Mass: it shall suffice that the bread be such as is usually
eaten, so the same be of the finest wheat bread. Now, whether the finest
wheat bread be always leauened: I report me to the common Bakers, at whose
hands, the bread that we minister with, is had.

But grant we had commanded the sacrament to be ministered in leauened bread:
should we therefore be heretics? What say you then to them that ministered in
the time before Alexander the first, Leauened bread commanded by Bishops of
Rome.
had commanded the ministration to be in unleavened bread, were all those men
heretics? And was Alexander himself an heretic, when he being Bishop of
Rome: did command that the ministration should be in leauened bread? I
think you will not grant it. For then it should follow that the head of your
Church may be an heretic. His purpose when he commanded the use of
unleavened bread, was not to teach that unleavened bread is the due matter
wherein the sacrament ought to be consecrated (as you teach) but as Platina
writes. Quia hoc modo, purior ac potior haberetur. That by this means it
might be accounted more pure, and of more value. It appears by the words of
the same Platina in the same place: that he had before commanded the
ministration to be in leauened bread: for he says. Oblationem quoque ex azimo,
non autem ex fermento, vt ante fieri mandauit: quia hoc modo. etc. The oblation
also, he commanded to be made of unleavened bread, not of leauened bread, as
he did before command: because by that mean. etc. His consideration in
commanding that the ministration should be in leauened bread, Pope Leo his
consideration.
might be the same that moved Pope Leo and his company to do the like (if
Nicholaus de Orbellis have not written a lie): that is to say, to blot out the
opinion of a necessity to follow the Jews in that point, as the Ebionits had
taught.

Did. 11. quest. 1 Lib. sent. 4
The same Nicholaus de Orbellis, a man of your own sort: says thus. Quod de
necessitate panis consecrabilis non est, neque quod sit Azymus, nec quod sit
fermentatus: quia non differunt specie. As touching the bread that may be
consecrated, it is not required of necessity, that it should be unleavened,
nor that it should be leauened: for they do not differ in speece or kind. And
he cyteth Anselmus in his book De Azymo, for his Author. Vnde tempore Leonis
Papae. etc. Wherefore, in the time of Pope Leo: it was ordained that the
consecration should be in leauened bread: to extinguishe and blot out the
heresy of the Ebionits, which said that of necessity the Christians must
follow the custom of the Jews.

Yea, and the same has said in the same question: Waffer cakes called stertch
by a Papist.
that the stertch cake that you do use in your Mass, is no competent matter,
for this consecration. His words be these. Non sufficit autem ad hoc pasta:
cum non sit cibus vsualis nec conueniens nutrimentum. Stertch or Paste, is not
sufficient matter for this consecration: seeing it is not usual sustenance, nor
convenient nourishment. I trust you will not condemn these men for heretics,
because they say that the sacrament may be ministered in leauened bread: for one
of them was a Pope, and the other holy men of the Popes faith.

But the general Counsel of Basil: has condemned these men for heretics.
You will not, I trow stick to the decrees of that counsel: and allow all
that was done therein. Eugenius then Pope: The pope put to his choice.
would not have allowed that counsel, if he might have had his own choice.
But being put to an hard choice: he chose rather to confirm that counsel,
then to be deposed of his Popedom. Your holy father the Pope, that sat in
Peter's Chair when you preached this sermon: would not have thought well of
you, if you should have told him that a general counsel might condemn a
Pope of heresy or depose him. But by your saying: the general counsel of
Basil, hat condemned two or three Popes doings, for heresy. For as I have
said before: Pope Leo ordained that the sacrament should be ministered in
leauened bread, and Pope Innocent the first used ministration in the same also.
As appears by his words in his first Epistle to Dicentius Byshyp of
Euglibine. Innoce^tius. 1. Epist. 1. Cap. 5. Concili. Tom. 1
Where he says thus. De fermento vero, quod die Dominico per titulos mittimus:
superflue nos consulere voluisti, cum omnes Ecclesiae nostrae intra Ciuitatem
sunt constitutae. Quarum presbyteri, quia Die ipse, propter plebem sibi
creditam, nobiscum conuenire non possunt: idcirco fermentum a nobis confectum,
per Accolythos accipiunt, vt se a nostra communione, maxim illa Die, non
iudicent separatos. As touching the leauened bread, that we do on the Sunday
send to every Parish: it is but in vain that you wylled us to consult, seeing
that all our Churches are cituate within the City. The elders whereof because
they can not, that day, by the means of the people that is committed to their
charge, come together with us: therefore they do receive by the inferior
ministers, the leauened bread that we have consecrated, that they should not
judge themselves to be separated from our communion, especially in that day.

There popes doings condemned by one general counsel.
Thus, if De Orbellis and you say true: a general counsel has condemned
three Popes, for heretics, Alexander, Leo, and Innocent: but you are not able
to prove this heresy, nor them heretics in this point.

The third sort of heretics that you speak of, were called Aquarij, water
drinkers. Against these did Cyprian and Chrysostom write. etc. But what is
this to us? we are no water drinkers.

But we are of that sort that myngle no water with the Wine: against whom
Theophilactus wrote. His words are these. Confundantur Armenij: qui non
admiscent in mysterijs aquam vino. Non enim credunt (vt videtur) quod aqua ex
latere egressa sit, quod admirabilius, sed sanguis tantum. Confounded be the
Armenians: which do not in the mysteries, mingle water with the wine. For (as
it seems) they believe not that water came forth of the side, which is more
marvelous, but blood only.

It seems that Theophilact wysheth confusion to the Armenians, because that
they in refusing to mix water with wine, did seem to deny the truth of the
history: but we are far enough from that suspicion. We believe that both
blood and water did issue out of Christ's side. Neither do we deny, but that
water may be mixed with the wine. But that the wine alone is not the due matter
of the sacrament, None has or can prove the necessity of mixing water with
the wine.
because there is no water mixed with it: neither has Theophilact nor any
other, hitherto sufficiently proved, neither are you or any of your sort able
(by scripture) to prove.

We reverence the ancient fathers, and all other that of later time have
written of matters of religion in the fear of God: but we have not sworn to
believe whatsoever they say without proof by scriptures, neither do they
desire credit, without such proof.

There were other heretics, Hist. trip. lib. 7. ca. 11.
that denied the effect of the Sacrament, as Messaliani, who (as it is written
by Theodoretus) said that the heavenly food whereof our Lord spoke, he that
eats my flesh and drinks my blood, shall live evermore, did neither profit
nor hurt any man.

Nestorius also the pernicious heretic and Archebyshop of Constantinople
destroyed the virtue of the sacrament, Theophilactus Capit. 10. ad hebr.
(as Theophilactus writes) for that he granting Christ's very flesh to be
really and truly present in the sacrament, denied that flesh being received
into our bodies, to be the proper flesh of Gods son, and therefore to have
no virtue to give life to our mortal bodies, and this heresy was condemned
by the general counsel, holden at Ephesus.

As touching the denying of the effect of the sacrament: CROWLEY.
I have sufficiently spoken, in the answer to your former sermon. The
Messalian heresy, we never held. August. De sacramentis fidelium.
But with saint Austen we believe and teach, that who so is partaker of that
meat that Christ spoke of when he said, he that eats my flesh and drinks
my blood, lives for ever: can not but have everlasting life thereby. And that
they which do receive the sacrament thereof unworthily: do eat and drink
their own condemnation.

Theodoretus therefore, in accompting those men for heretics: has done but as
we would have done, if we had been in his days, and as we do now in allowing
that which he has done therein. But in one point me thinks that these men
were very like you and your sort: The Popish Priests like the Messalians.
for they disalowed the labor of the hands as evil, and gave themselves to
idleness and sleep, and called the fantasies of their dreams, prophecies.
Look in your Legenda aurea, and other such books: and you shall see that your
sort are not far unlike those Messalians.

The heresy of Nestorius is far enough from us. For we confess and teach:
that Christ is both perfect God and perfect man. And that both those perfect
natures: Theophilactus in.10. ad hebr.
are knit together in one Christ, unseparably. How he destroyed ye virtue of
the sacrament: you say Theophilact does tell us. Speaking of the Nestorians he
says. Vteris hoc loco etiam aduersus Nestorianos. Nam illi, exiguum hominem
estimantes Christum: sanguinem eius communem, id est prophanum censuerunt,
neque quicquam a reliquis habere discriminis. Thou may use this place also,
against the Nestorians. For they esteeming Christ to be but a man of small
reputation, supposed his blood to be common, that is to say profane, not
having in it any thing at all, whereby it differs from the rest.

How justly you do of these words gather, that Nestorius did grant, that the
very flesh of Christ is really and truly in the sacrament. etc. Watson
sucketh out the dregs of old writers.
I refer to the judgment of all indifferent readers. But it is your manner,
to suck out the dregs of every writer that you meddle with. And if you can
find none such as you would: yet you will so iumble together some part of his
clear and wholesome lycour, that at the first sight it may seem to be as
filthy dregs, as is to be found in any of the Popes vessels.

If you had not minded to make the world believe, that we be stuffed with all
these heresies: you might have spared a great deal of your labor in making
mention of these condemned so long before, and not holden nor taught of us,
against whom you speak and write, neither directly serving to the purpose that
you seem to have in hand.

WATSON. Division. 14 Epiphanius Anacephaleosi.
And where as this sacrament can not be consecrated, but by a Priest: there was
an heretic called Zacheus, condemned (as Epiphanius writes) because he would
pray with no man, but alone, and therefore without reverence and authority,
did handle the holy mysteries, and being a lay man, did impudently order and
use them.

Also certain heretics called Anthropomorphitae, denied the reservation of
the sacrament saying, that Christ's body remained there no longer, then it was
in receiving. Of whom Cyrillus writes thus. Cyrillus ad Calosirium.
Dicunt mysticam benedictionem, si ex ea remanserint in sequentem diem
reliquiae, ad sanctificationem inutilem esse: sed insaniunt haec dicentes, non
enim mutatur Christus neque sanctum eius corpus discedit, sed benedictionis
virtus and vinifica gratia continuo manet in illis.

They say that the mystical benediction (which as the sacrament) is not
profitable to the sanctification of the receauer, if there remain any thing of
the sacrament to the next day. But they be stark mad that say so, for Christ
is not changed, nor yet his holy body does not depart away but the virtue of
the benediction, and the grace of giving life, do continually abide and
remain in that that leaves.

This heresy is new revived again by Martyne Luther and his sect, but it can
not stand, being condemned of old time, and now also by the Catholic Church.

You can not justly charge us with the doings of Zachaeus, CROWLEY. Massing
pristes are not lawful ministers of Christ's sacraments.
of whom Epiphanius does write: For we pray together, and we receive the
sacraments ministered by none other, but such as are ministers lawfullye
admitted, except any such remain among us without repentance, as have been
Massing priests, and never desired to be other.

As for your Anthropomorphits: I think it strange, that in an open Auditory,
you durst affirm that Cyrill wrote against them or of them, seeing that by the
computation of time, it is manifest that Cyrillus whose works are extant, was
dead.500. years before that heresy was regarded of many.

You note in the mergine of your book, that Cyrill wrote of those heretics to
Calosirium. Words of Cyrill not found in his works.
If a man should desire you to show that Epistle or book of his, either in
print or writing: I think it would not easily be done.

But your friend Master Harding says, that this saying of Cyrill is cyted by
Thomas Aquinas. Part. 3.9.76. Capit. 11.
A good ground to build upon. Thomas Aquinas lived within these.400. years, and
understood no word of the Greek (as Erasmus has noted upon the Epistle to
the Romans) and he cyting matter out of a Greek Author, which is not yet to
be found in Latin: must be of sufficient Authority, to cause all men to
think, that as many as deny the body of Christ to be really and substantially
in the sacrament reserved in a Box, are heretics, condemned by the fathers of
old time, and now also by the Catholic Church.

But let us see, how well you and your friend Master Harding do agree
between your selves, and with your Master Thomas Aquinas, in reporting these
words of Cyrill. Harding says. Non enim alius fit Christus: neque sanctum
eius corpus immutabitur. For Christ is not changed: neither shall his holy
body be changed. And you say. Non enim mutatur Christus: neque sanctum eius
corpus discedit. For Christ is not changed: neither does his holy body depart
away. Part. 3. quest. 76.
But your Master Thomas says. Non enim mutabitur sacramentum corporis
Christi. The sacrament of the body of Christ shall not be changed.

By this may the learned judge, what lykelyhood of truth thereis: in this that
is fathered upon Cyrillus. More might be noted: but I leave it to the diligence
of the indifferent readers.

But this makes me much to muse, that you shame not to say, that the
Catholic Church (meaning thereby the popish Church) does now condemn the
error of the Anthropomorphits: seeing that in every Church and Chapel, and in
many other places, is not only suffered, but maintained, the Image of God the
father and the holy ghost, both set forth in the form and fashion of a
mortal man, as though the divine nature had such parts and proporsions of a
body, as Christ had in his manhood and has still. I understand that the error
that the Anthropomorphits held, was that the Godhead is a bodily substance,
and that man in his bodily shape, does resemble the shape and fashion of that
substance.

It had been much for your honesty therefore (as I think) not to have meddled
so much with this error: The papists are Anthropomorphits.
for we, whom you would have men think to be defiled with it, are clear from
it, and you your self most filthily wadled in it.

WATSON. Division. 15
Many more heresies there be condemned, concerning the sacrament, beside the
heresy of Berrengarius, that twice did recant it in two provincial counsels.
And at his death took great penance for his damnable opinion, as the stories
tell: and also beside the condemnation of John Wyckliefe, in the general
counsel at Constaunce. But I will not hinder my purpose with a long rehearsal
of them.

These be sufficient to show the consent of the Church, by the condemnation of
heretics: he that would know more arguments, to prove the consent in this or
any other matter: let him read a book called Vincentius Lirinensis, contra
prophanas haeresu vnouitates. He may bye it for less then six pense, and find
there a great treasure of good learning. Now to our purpose of the sacrifice.
Here the prayer was made.

The true Church of Christ whose rule is ye word of God: CROWLEY. Gods word is
the rule of the Church.
has always condemned all manner of heresies. But that is not the Church of
Rome, which you would gladly cause men to think to be that catholic Church.

As for the heresy of Berrengarius: by the report of Lanfrancus his greatest
enemy, was this. Per consecrationem altaris, Lanfrancus De Eucharist.
panis and vinum fiunt sacramentum Religionis: non vt desinant esse quae erant,
etc. By the consecration of the altar, the bread and wine, are made a
sacrament of religion: not that they leave to be the same that they were
before, but that they be altered into another thing, and become that they were
not before. As Ambrose writes. etc.

Here is a perilous heresy. Ambr. de sa. lib. 4. cap. 4. August. De Cate. and
Epist. 23. De Consecr. Did. 2.
If Berrengarius be an heretic for writing thus: then must Ambrose and Austen
both be heretics as well as he. For they wrote the same doctrine. But
Berrengarius has recanted his heresy in two prouincial counsels, and at his
death took great penance for the same as stories do tell: when you shall show
those histories, you shall see what we can say to them. Thus we find ye
Berrengarius, was by Pope Nicholas ye second enforced to recant in this wise.
Consentio autem sanctae romanae Ecclesiae, and apostolicae sedi: and ore and
cord profiteor de sacramentis dominicae mensae, eandem fidem me tenere, quam
Dominus and venerabilis Papa Nicholaus, and haec sancta Synodus autoritate
euangelica and apostolica tenendam tradidit, mihique firmauit. Silicet Panem
and vinum quae in altar ponuntur, post consecrationem, non solum sacramentum:
sed etiam verum Corpus and sanguinem Domini nostri Jesus Christi esse, and
sensualiter non solum sacramentum, sed in veritate, manibus sacerdotum
tractari, frangi, fidelium dentibus atteri.

I do consent (says Berrengarius) to the holy Church of Rome, and to the
Apostolic seat: and with heart and mouth I do profess, that I do hold the
same faith concerning the sacraments of the Lords table, which my Lord and
reverend Pope Nicholas, and this holy Synod, have by the Authority of the
Gospel and Apostles, taught to be holden, and have assured me. That is to
say, that the bread and wine, which are set on the altar, are not only a
sacrament after the consecration, but also the very body and blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ: and that not only the sacrament, but the body of Christ in
deed, is sensibly handled and broken by the priests hands, and grounds with
the teeth of the faithful.

The homely gloss upon the same place, does so mislike with this recantation of
Berrengarius or rather the decree of the Synod: A pretty recantation.
that he says thus. Nisi sane intelligas verba Berrengarij: in maiorem incides
haeresim quam ille habuit. Except a man do warsly understand the words of
Berrengarius: he shall fall into a greater heresy, then ever Berrengarius
held any.

The Pope and ye whole Synod do decree an heresy.
By this it is manifest, even by the writer of this gloss: that Pope Nicholas,
and the whole Synod at Rome, did decree and teach to be holden, and enforce
Berrengarius to confess, a greater heresy then ever he held before. And how
does this prove, the consent of your Popish Church, in condemning of heresies?

For the condemnation of Wyckliefe, in the counsel of Constance, I refer the
reader as before. And your own Lirinensis, will not take your part in this
matter. For he was dead many hundred years before Berrengarius was borne.

But I am glad that you have now found, that there may be great treasure of
good learning in six penie books. Six penie books.
I trust you will not now deny, but there may be some good learning in books
of half the price.

WATSON. Division. 16
Against the blessed Mass, which is the sacrifice of the Church, many words
of many men have been said, but sufficient reprofe of it has not yet been
heard. Here the prayer was made.


Scriptures never one was yet alleged against it, saving one out of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, where saint Paul writes, Hebr. 9.
that Christ entered into heaven by his own blood once, and afterward he says
Christ was once offered up to take away the sins of many: and all the
argument consists in this word (once) which I shall (God wylling) discuss
hereafter.

But in very deed that same scripture that they bring against the Mass to no
purpose, is the very foundation of the Mass, whereupon the Mass is builded
and established, after what sort I shall declare as time will serve.

How sufficient proofs have been brought against the Mass: CROWLEY.
shall easily appear to as many as will read, that which Bishop Jewel has
written for an answer to your friend Master Harding. And some sufficient
proofs may be seen in this that I have answered to your two notable sermons.

One scripture only you say, has been hitherto alleged against your Mass.
Bylike you have not seen John Caluines Institutions: Where in the fourth book
and.xviij. Chapter, he alleges more then four places of scripture against
it. Three, out of the first Epistle to the Corinths, Many proofs against the
Mass.
one out of Saint John's Gospel the.19. Chapter: and the same text that you
take for the theme of your two Sermons. But what should we make reconing of a
multitude of places: since one alleged in the true meaning, is sufficient?

But you have promised to prove, that one place which is alleged against your
Mass: to be the foundation of the same. Which when you shall go about to do:
I will (God wylling) prove, that no such building can stand upon such
foundation.

Like as there is one God the father, WATSON. Division. 17 Ephesians. 1. Hebr. 7.9.
and 10.
one Christ our redeemer, one body and Church which is redeemed: so there is
but one only sacrifice, whereby we be redeemed, which was once and never but
once made upon the altar of the Cross for the sins of all men.

1. John. 8.
This sacrifice is propitiatory, and a sufficient price, and ransom of the
whole world, as saint John says, he is the propitiation for our sins, and
not for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole world, John. 1.
and in his Gospel he writes. Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the
sins of the world.

The virtue of this sacrifice began, when God promised that the seed of Adam
should bruise and break the Serpents head, Genes. 3.
without the merit of this sacrifice there is no salvation, 2. Cor. 5.
for God was in Christ reconcyling the world to himself.

This sacrifice is common to both the Testaments, whereof both take their
effect, whose virtue is extended from the beginning of the world to the last
end, Apoc. 13.
for the Lamb was slain from the beginning of the world, as saint John says.
It is also a bloody and a passible sacrifice, extending to the death of him
that offered himself, Galath. 3.
and it was promised to the fathers, and performed in the fullness of time, the
merits whereof receive no augmentation, because it is perfect, nor yet
diminution, because it is eternal. And although this sacrifice be sufficient
to save all men, yet it is not effectual to the salvation of all men: it is
able to save all, but yet all be not saved: for what does it profit the
Turks, Saracenes, unfaithful Gentiles, and counterfeyt christians? The fault
is not in God, being merciful to all his works, who created us without us:
but the fault is in our selves.

CROWLEY. Watson can speak truth.
If all the rest of your two Sermons, had been according to this piece: I would
not have misliked with you. For I confess all this to be most true.

WATSON. Division. 18.
Therefore that this sacrifice of Christ, as it is sufficient for all, so it
may be effectual and profitable for all.

God has ordained certain means, whereby we may be made able to receive the
merit of it, and whereby the virtue of it is brought and applied unto us in
the new testament, after his passion, as it was to the fathers in the old
testament, before his passion. Of these means some be inward, some be
outward: the inward be common to both the testaments, of which the first and
principal is faith, for without faith it is not possible to please God, and as
saint John says, he that believes not, Hebr. 11. John. 3.
is now already judged: to him therefore that is an Infidel Christ has dyed
in vain.

Charity also is a mean, 1. John. 3. 1. John. 2. 1. Cor. 13.
for he that loves not remains in death, he that hates his brother, is in
darkness, and walks in darkness, and can not tell whether he goes: and
if I have all faith, and have no charity, I am nothing.

He is not therefore partaker of Christ's merits in the remission of sin, that
lacks charity. And so may we say of hope, without the which no man receaueth
mercy at Christ's hand.

It is true that you say: CROWLEY. The means whereby Christ's merits are
applied to us.
no man can be partaker of Christ's merits, without faith, love, and hope. And
we say, that these three be so lyncked together: that one of them can not be
without the other. And that God is the giver of these three means: whereby the
merits of his son are made ours. And that these are the only mean whereby
the fathers before, and we since the death of Christ, be made partakers thereof.

Amongst the inward means there be other spiritual sacrifices, as the
sacrifice of a contrite heart, WATSON. Division. 19.
which God does much regard, the sacrifice of our lips, Psalm. 50. Osee. 14.
Luc. 11. Math. 7. Hebr. 13.
which is prayer and praise of God, whereby we attain remission of sin,
having a plain promise, that whatsoever we ask of God in the name of Christ,
we shall obtain it. And the sacrifices of almose and benevolence, which saint
Paul would not have us to forget, because God is gotten and won by such
sacrifices.

All these and other such like do not fully deserve grace and remission of
sin, but be means, that the virtue and merit of Christ's passion may be
derived and applied unto us, as he has ordained.

CROWLEY.
Here you show your self somewhat. You will not receive the merits of Christ
freely: but you will by faith, love, hope, contrition, prayer, praise and
almose, deserve some part thereof. But Christ has taught us to say, that when
we have done all that we are commanded to do: Luc. 17.
we shall say, that we are unprofitable bond men, that is, such as can deserve
nothing, more then bond slaves can deserve at the hands of their Lords and
Masters, Blasphemous doctrine.
whose bond slaves they are. Your doctrine therefore in this point is
blasphemy. For you ascribe to man's merit, that which is to be ascribed to the
mercy of God alone.

WATSON. Division. 20
There be also other outward means, as sacraments and sacrifices. Of
sacraments some be proper to the old Testament, some proper to the new,
without the which ordinarily there is no remission of sin, nor collation of
grace.

As circumcision was to the fathers, so baptism is to us, without the which
this bloody sacrifice takes not away original sin, not because it can not,
Gene. 17. John. 3. John. 6. Luc. 13.
but because God has so ordained. For as it is said in the old Testament,
whose flesh is not circumcised, his soul shall be put away from the people:
so it is said in the new Testament, except a man be borne again of the water
and the holy ghost, he can not see the kingdom of God: and except ye eat the
flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye shall not have life in you:
and except ye do penance, ye shall all likewise perish.

And so must we think of all other sacraments of both the testamentes, that
they be means ordained of God to atteine the grace they signify, which grace
is fully purchased and deserved by the passion of Christ, whereof only they
take their effect. For the old sacraments have their virtue and strength. Ex
opere operando (as the school men say) that is to say, of the work that is to
be wrought upon the Cross by Christ, in whom only they believed. The new
sacraments have their virtue Ex opere operato, of the work of Christ that is
already wrought upon the cross: and not of any worthynesse of the priest, the
minister. By the merit of which work upon the cross, they have virtue and
efficacy appropried unto them, to give that grace they signify, to such as
worthyly receive them, or at least, that have no impediment, nor put no stop,
but that the grace may be received.

It is true, CROWLEY.
that there be some sacraments proper to the old Testament, and some proper
to the new: but the latter part of that sentence wherein you affirm this, is
some thing obscure. You seem to affirm, that there is no remission of sin,
Gene. 15. Luc. 23. Acts. 10.
nor collation of grace, without the sacraments: which saying is most false.
For Abraham had his sins forgiven him, before he was circumcised: and so had
the thief that hanged on the cross by Christ, without the sacrament baptism.
And Cornelius and his company, had received the gift of the holy ghost: before
they were baptized.

But you say, that ordinarily, there is no remission of sins, nor collation
of grace: without sacraments. Watsons dark speaking.
By which manner of speaking, you amaze the people: who can gather none other
thing thereby, but that commonly God does not forgive sins, nor collate or
bestow his graces upon any, before they do receive the sacraments, that he
has instituted to signify the same. Which is most false. For faith, and the
fear of God, are the beginning of all heavenly wisdom: and must needs be had
of every one that shall receive any sacrament, Hebr. 11. Mark. 16.
before the receiving thereof can be any thing at all auayleable. For without
faith it is not possible to please God. And he that will not believe, shall be
condemned. To receive a sacrament therefore without faith: is to no purpose.

Sacraments, both of the old and new Testament were instituted, not to give
grace, but to confirm the grace already given and received: Romans 4.
as appears plainly by that which saint Paul writes to the Romans. Et
signum accepit Circumcisionis, signaculum iustitiae fidei quae fuerat in
praeputio. etc. And he received the sign of circumcision, the seal of the
righteousness of faith, which was in him before he was circumcised: that he
might be the father of all that believe, among the uncircumcised, that the same
might be reconed to them for righteousness also. etc.

By this it is manifest, that Gods ordinary mean of forgiving sins and
conferring grace: is by his holy spirit of adoption, whereby he does regenerate
his elected and chosen children, and not any Sacraments, either of the old
Testament or the new.

As for the places that you cite for circumcision, baptism, the sacrament of
Christ's body and penance: you might have spared till you had found a fitter
place for them. For they serve nothing to prove that which you pretend to prove.

We know, that baptism is the same to us, that circumcision was to the
fathers, and that as the uncircumcised might not be suffered to live among the
people of God: so such as refuse baptism, cannot see the kingdom of God. And
that except we do eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood: we
shall have no life in us. And that except we repent: we shall all perish as the
Galileans did. But what makes this for the proof of your purpose? Which is,
that sacraments be the ordinary means to take away sins and confer
grace: since the forgiveness of sins and grace, must be conferred before we
can be meet to receive the sacraments?

How truly you report the opinion of the Schoolmen, for Opus operandum and
Opus operatum: I might refer to such as have been exercised in the wrytings
of those Scholemen. But least you should think that it were but a shift so to
do: I will put you in remembrance of some part of that which you have read,
if you be so good a Shoole man as you would seem to be.

Nicholaus de Orbellis says thus. In sacramento autem proprie dicto, virtute
operis operati confertur gratia, Libr. 4. Sent Did. 1. q. 3.
ita quod non requiritur bonus motus interior qui mereatur gratiam: sed
tantummodo sufficit, quod recipiens non ponat obicem. I answer (says he) that
in a sacrament that is properly so called, grace is conferred by the virtue of
the work wrought, so that the good inward motion which might deserve grace,
is not required: but this only is sufficient, that the receyuer of the
sacrament do not put a bar in the way.

Again, the same Nicholas says. Baptismus generaliter intendit gratiam iam
habitam: sed ita non est in Circumcisione. Vnde Abrahae iam iustificato,
signaculum fuit, and ei nihil intus contulit. Quia gratia Abrahae iam
attigerat, and transcenderat illum gradum ad quem determinata fuerat
Circumcisio. Baptism does generally increase the grace that is already had:
but in circumcision, it is not so. Wherefore to Abraham that was already
justified, it was only a seal: and did inwardly increase him nothing at all.
For Abraham's grace had attained unto, yea and passed the degree, that
circumcision was appointed to aspire unto.

Thomas Aquinas says. In Baptismo confertur gratia ex virtute ipsius Baptismi
quam habet in quantum est instrumentum passionis Christi iam perfectae: in
Circumcisione vero, conferebatur gratia, Part. 3. quest. 70. Art. 4.
non ex virtute Circumcisionis: sed ex virtute passionis Christi, cuius signum
erat Circumcisio. In baptism, grace is conferred by the virtue of baptism it
self, in as much as it is the instrument of the passion of Christ already
perfected. But in circumcision, grace was conferred, not by the virtue of
circumcision: but by the virtue of Christ's passion, whereof circumcision was a
sign.

Scotus says. In circumcisione, solum peccata dimittebantur: Cap. penult.
nec gratia ibi dabatur. In circumcision, sins were forgiven only: grace was
not therein given.

By these few places, it may appear, that the Schoolmen be not all one with
you, nor one of them with another, in this matter of conferring of grace by
sacraments Ex opere operato. Et, Ex opere operando, as you alone do imagine,
as I suppose.

I advertise the indifferent reader therefore: to give credit to neither of
you both, in this point: but to use the sacraments of Christ, according to
Christ's institution, for the confirmation of their faith in Christ. Ascribing
to the mercy of God in Christ: all the remission of sins, that is by those
sacraments signified.

WATSON. Division. 21
Beside the sacraments, there be sacrifices instituted of God: as means
whereby the passion of Christ, the true sacrifice is signified, represented,
and applied. As the Paschall Lamb, the continual sacrifice for sin, a
sacrifice for giving thanks, Exo. 12.19. Lc. 1.4.5.7. Leuit. 3.
for the sins of the priest and of the people, for infirmity and omission,
for peace, for any benefit to be attained, for chastity and such other: which
had strength, not by their own nature, but by the virtue of Christ's passion
which they signified.

And as these were sacrifices proper to the old Testament: so Christ has
instituted, a new external sacrifice, proper to the new testament, by his
passion abrogating the other, which were shadows signifying, and stablishing
this, which is the truth representing, for this intent that the virtue and
sufficiency of his bloody and saving sacrifice, may be without iteration of it
self continually transferred unto us.

For seeing there is but one God, author of both the testaments, one body, one
faith of Christ to us both, though they believed in Christ to come, we in
Christ already commed: it follows consequently, that we of the new
testament, may not lack this mean of sacrifice, so necessary and expedient
for us. For so should we (as I have partly touched in my last sermon) be
without al kind of religion, having now no sacrifice remaining proper unto our
selves.

Like as to the imperfect law there succeeded a perfect law, and to the
figurative sacraments, there succeeded perfect and effectual working
sacraments: even so to the figurative and typical sacrifices, there succedeth
one true and perfect sacrifice of Christ, one in substance, but diverse in
manner.

Law, sacrifice, priesthood, and altar be (as the Logitians say) relatiua,
that is to say, one hanging and depending upon another, as saint Paul says,
Translato sacerdotio necesse est, vt legis translatio fiat. If the priesthood
be translate, Hebrae.
then the law must needs be translate likewise.

And then like as if there be a father, there is a son, if there be a
master, there is a servant: so if there be a new law of the new testament,
there is also a priesthood, a sacrifice, and an aultare properly belonging to
the new Testament.

A perfect and continual law requires a perfect sacrifice of like
continuance: the new law of it should lack a priesthood and sacrifice
private to it self, it should either be imperfite, or else utterly destroyed.

For this cause our savior Christ in his last supper, did institute the
sacrament of his body and blood commending unto us two several uses of it,
the one that should be received of us, 1. Cor. 11.
as our heavenly food to nourishe us in spiritual life till we come to be
perfect men in Christ, saying: take eat this is my body. The other use, that
it should be offered in the remembrance of his passion, the ministration of
which offering he has committed to his Apostles, as to priests of the new
law, saying, do this in my remembrance, for the which function they and their
successors be specially priests.

This is the doctrine of Christ's catholic Church which I have as yet but
simply declared, not evidently proved which is sufficient to persuade an
obedient catholic man that follows the Church, but not sufficient to convince
an obstinate heretic, that denies the Church, impugning the doctrine and
determination of the Church.

The sacrifices that God ordained to be offered in the tune of the old law,
CROWLEY, Hebr. 10. Sacrifices are not means to take away sins.
were shadows and figures of good things then to come, and not the good things
themselves (as saint Paul says) neither could they by any means take away
sin, neither had they any such strength by the virtue of Christ's passion, as
you do imagine them to have. And where you imagine, that as those sacrifices
were proper to the old law, so there must of necessity, be one sacrifice
proper to the new testament, seeing there is but one God. etc. I have
sufficiently answered in mine answer to the tenth division of your former
Sermon, where you have touched it as you say here.

And when you say, that to the imperfect law, there succeeds a perfect law.
etc. it seems that you have forgotten that which you said before in the.xx.
Watson forgets his last sayings.
division of this Sermon, where you affirm, that the sacraments of the old
law did confer grace, Ex opere operando, by ye work that was then to be
wrought, and now you say that they were but figurative, and not effectual
working sacraments, and therefore such must succeed them.

When you shall prove that Moses his law and the sacraments thereof, be an
imperfect law and imperfect sacraments: then will I allow your similitude.
But so long as you shall not be able to prove any imperfection in either of
them: I will reject your similitude, as foolish and vain.

Galath. 3.
I know that the law could bring nothing to perfection, because it was not
ordained to that end to bring things to perfection: Romans 10. Christ is the
perfection of the law.
but (as saint Paul writes) to lead unto Christ. And Christ is the
perfection and end of the law. That is to say. Christ makes those perfect:
whom the law, with the sacraments and ceremonies thereof do bring unto him.
And so that sacrifice that Christ offered once for all: is the end and
perfection of all the sacrifices of the old law, which is no more all one in
substance with the sacrifices of the old law that you speak of: then the
shadow of any body, is one in substance with the body it self.

Law, sacrifice, priesthood. etc. be relatiues, and as saint Paul says, when
the priesthood is translated, the law must also be translated: But what makes
this to your purpose, to prove, that there must needs be in the new law, such
a sacrifice, priesthood, and altar, as you imagine? Is it not sufficient that
we have such a sacrifice, Romans 12. 1. Peter. 2. Apoc. 6.
priesthood, and altar, as Paul, Peter and John speak of? Must we needs have
such a priesthood, sacrifice and altar, as the Popes Antichristian Church has
devised and maintains? You must prove it more substantially, before any that
is either learned in the scriptures or godly wise, will believe you.

A perfect and contynuall law, requires a perfect and continual sacrifice,
as you say: and shall not that reasonable serving of God that saint Paul
speaks of in the place that you have taken for your theme, be as perfect and
contynuing a sacrifice, Romans 12. Romans 3.
as the law of faith, is a perfect and contynuall law? I think there is none
that understands what christian religion is: but the same will consent, to
that which I have said hereof.

For this cause (say you) our savior Christ, did in his last supper institute.
etc. you tell us here, of two several uses of the sacrament of Christ's body
and blood. One is, that it should be received of us. etc. This you confirm
with a note in the mergine. 1. Cor. 11. It is true that Paul teaches that
doctrine there, Paul's doctrine not so gross as Watsons.
even as he himself had learned of the Lord: but not in such gross manner as
you do teach in these two fine Sermons. He teaches there, that our savior
christ did ordain, that this holy sacrament should be received of christians:
in the remembrance of his death and passion, and that being so received of us,
it is a food yt does nourish us in spiritual life. Otherwise, it is a
co^de^nation to the receivers.

As for the other use, which you say is, to be offered in remembrance of
Christ's passion: you go about to prove, by do this in my remembrance. And
then (very well) you say, that you have but simply declared it without evident
proof. It had been good that you had dealt simply, and not so subtly, as to
cite the words of Christ in such sort, that it might seem, Watson deals not
simply.
that he had given commandment, that the sacrament of his body should be
offered in sacrifice: where as it is manifest by the circumstaunce of the
place, that he commanded the sacrament to be received in the remembrance of
his death and passion.

But your only assertion without proof, is sufficient to persuade an obedient
Catholic. etc. Watsons obedient Catholics.
You account for obedient Catholics, such only as will captiuate all their
senses, and believe all that you say and do to be good and godly: and follow
you whether soever you lead them, though they see plainly that you go before
them into the bottomless pit of hell.

Well, let us see now, how you can convince by arguments, those that will not
obediently say white is black, light darkness, and good evil: for such you
call heretics, that deny the Church, and impugn the doctrine and
determination of the same.

WATSON. Division. 22
But to our purpose, that the oblation of Christ's body and blood in the Mass
is the sacrifice of the Church, and proper to the new testament, I shall prove
it you by the best arguments that we have in our schole of divinity, that is to
say, first by the institution of our savior Christ, then by the prophecy of
Malachy the prophet, thirdly by the figure of Melchisedech in the old law, and
this shall I do not expounding the scriptures after mine own head, but as
they have been taken from the beginning of the most ancient and Catholic
fathers in all ages.

1. Cor. 11.
This sacrifice was instituted by the commandment of Christ, saying to his
Apostles, do this in my remembrance.

Our new men laugh at us where we say, that this commandment of Christ does
prove the oblation of the sacrament. But we pity them, that set so light by
that they are bounden to believe, and can not disprooue, seeming evidently not
to regard and way the fact of Christ, and their obedience to his
commandment.

When Christ said, do this: by this word (this) must needs be understood
all that he did, concerning the institution of this sacrament. Let us now see
what Christ did.

First he did consecrate his precious body and blood by blessing the bread,
saying, this is my body, this is my blood, for if this consecration be not
comprehended under this word ( Hoc, this) then have we no commandment nor
authority to consecrate this sacrament, and so should we be usurpers to do
that thing we have no warrant to show for us in holy scripture. But without
doubt, this is so plain, that we need say no more of it, except we should
utterly deny this sacrament, and the whole ministration of it, which (I think)
no man does.

Secondarily, Christ did offer, that he did consecrate which appears by these
his words: This is my body, which is given for you. And although this oblation
may be proved sufficiently otherwise, yet to my simple judgment there seems
to be no light argument in this word ( Datur is given): for seeing the
scripture says, it is given for us, and not to us, as Zwinglius and our great
Archbishop his Disciple would have it, we must needs understand by (given
for us) offered for us, so that in this place and many other to give is to
offer.

And although it be true, that Christ was given and offered for us to the
father, upon the cross the next day following, yet because the word (Datur) is
in Greek in all the Evangelists, where it is expressed in the present tense,
and also every sentence is true for the time it is pronounced, therefore me
think I may certainly conclude, because Christ says, datur pro vobis, is
given for you, that even then in the supper time he offered his body for us to
his father.

Thirdly, Christ did deliver to his disciples to be eaten and dronken, that he
had before consecrated and offered, Math. 29.
and this appears by his words. Take, eat, and drink ye all of this. The
first and the third which be the consecration and receiving, be out of all
controversy confessed of all men.

The second which is the oblation, is of late brought in question, which I have
partly proved by the plain words of scripture, as it seems to me, so that I
may well reason thus: Christ's action is our instruction (I except his
wonderful works and miracles) specially when his commandment is joined unto
it. But Christ in his supper offered himself verily and really under the forms
of bread and wine after an impossible manner, and commanded us to do the same,
till his second coming: me think therefore, that the Mass we do and ought
to do sacrifice, and offer Christ unto his father, which oblation is the
external sacrifice of the Church, and proper to the new testament.

CROWLEY. The best arguments of the Popes divinity school.
Now to your purpose. etc. you will prove by the best arguments in your
divinity schole: that Christ's body and blood offered in the Mass, is the
sacrifice of the Church. etc. And as it appears: the best arguments of your
school, are these three. The institution of Christ, the prophecy of Malachie,
and the figure of Melchisedech. Well, I trust the reader shall in that which
follows, see how well you do perform your promise.

Do this in my remembrance (says Christ) that is, offer up this in my
remembrance (say you) and except you be deceived: Christ has in these words,
instituted the sacrifice of ye Mass.

Your new men you say, do laugh at you. etc. And you do pity them. etc.
Bilyke you have a delight to be laughed at: for you have in the words
following, given more occasion to be laughed at, as shall appear in this
answer.

Watsons pity. Luc. 23.
Your pity is much like that which was in the women of Jerusalem: when they
wept to see the miserable estate of Christ, which was condemned to die, being
an Innocent.

Watson will make his new masters laugh.
When Christ said, do this. etc. All that Christ did: must needs be
understood by this word (this) and therefore you will see what Christ did.
First he consecrated his precious body and blood. etc. Might not your new men
think you, justly laugh at you: when you allege that for your purpose, that
makes most against you? do this says Christ. What shall we do? say you.
Take bread says Christ. And when you have given thanks: break it and
distribute it, and eat it, for it is my body. Then take the cup, and when ye
have given thanks: drink ye all of it, for it is my blood of the new
testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. Thus far
according as Mathewe writes.

What ground have you in these words, for the institution of the Mass? He
does not say, prepare you ministering garments of a strange fashion. Neither
does he bid you make those garments holy. He speaks no word of your hallowed
aultare, Superaltare, Cup, or Corporasse cloth. He makes no mention of your
thin stertch cake, nor of myxing water with your wine. He has no word of
your manifold crossings, turnings, and half turnings, with the rest of the
Apishe toys whereof your Mass does consist. But he took bread and wine, What
Christ did at his last supper.
such as the present occasion did offer. And he gave thanks to his heavenly
father: and did presently distribute the same to those Disciples of his that
were then present, commanding them all to eat and drink thereof in the
remembrance of his death and passion, as often as they should think it meet
by a sacrament to celebrate the remembrance thereof. Assuring them that in so
doing, they should be partakers of his body and blood, to the nourishing of
their souls and bodies to everlasting life.

Here is a plain institution of the holy communion of the body and blood of
our savior Jesus Christ: but for your transubstantiating consecration that you
use in your Mass, here is no warrant at all. By your own judgment therefore,
your Antichristian Clerks are but usurpers, having no warrant in the word of
God, to show for your doings in this point. The matter therefore is not so
plain on your side: as you would have men think it to be.

The like foundation you have found to build your oblation upon. Christ has
said: Which is given for you. And to your simple judgment: there seems no
little argument, in this word Datur, is given. etc. And therefore you conclude:
that Christ did at his last supper, even in the supper time, offer his body for
us to his father.

Matthew, and Mark, make no mention of this Datur, Mat. 26. Mar. 14.
that you build upon. Bilyke therefore, it is not so great a matter as you
would make of it. For if the church can have no sacrifice but that which is
builded upon Datur, it is to be thought that Matthew and Mark knew nothing of
the Church sacrifice.

But in Luke you find Quod pro vobis datur, which is given for you, not to
you, as Zwynglius and Cranmer his Scholar, would have it. You conclude
therefore, that given for us, must needs signify, offered for us. So that in
this place and many other (but you name not one) to give, is to offer. Many
places but none named.
And because all the Evangelists have it in the Greek expressed in the
present tense. etc. you think you may certainly conclude, because Christ
says Datur pro vobis, is given for you: that even then in the supper time, he
offered his body for us to his father.

First, I must say unto you, that when you shall show us, those places,
wherein, to give is to offer: then we will weigh them, and if we shall find
that true which you affirm here, we will say as you say, that Christ did in
his last supper offer up his body to his father. Till that time, you must
pardon us.

1. Cor. 11.
Saint Paul says. Quod pro vobis frangitur, which is broken for you. It were
strange if we should say, that broken does signify offered, in this place and
many other, and be not able to show any one place where it is so used. And it
is manifest by ye histories of the Gospel: that Christ's body was not broken
upon the cross. For it was prophesied, that there should no bone of him be
broken.

And although this be expressed in the present tense, and every sentence is
true for the time it is pronounced: The speakers meaning, is the truth of the
sentence spoken.
yet may you not conclude as you do certainly and say, that Christ offered his
body in his supper. For the truth of the sentence, is in that meaning that does
by other parts of scripture, appear to be the meaning of the speaker.

Christ's body was given for us, when he became man that he might dye for us,
when he was given over into the power of his enemies which sought his life,
when he went up to Jerusalem, declaring before hand to his Disciples, that he
must there be crucified: and when Judas had bargayned with the high priests,
to deliver him to them.

When Christ was given and his body broken for us.
And when our Savior christ was cruelly dealt with by the Jews in any
condition: then was his body broken for us. Thus are these sentences true for
the time they were pronounced: and yet, neither does given signify offered, nor
broken signify, torn in pieces.

Thirdly (you say) christ did deliver to his Disciples to be eaten and dronken:
Watson has ouershot himself to far.
that which he had before consecrated and offered. Here you have ouershot your
self, a great deal to far. For if Christ had offered and consecrated before
he gave to his Disciples: we may ask what he offered, and with what words he
consecrated. If he did consecrate with these words, this is my body: this is
my blood: then could he offer to his father none other thing but bread and
wine, before he had given the same to his Disciples. For he spoke not those
words, till he had both broken the bread and delivered it and the wine to his
Disciples. If consent of the Evangelists, both in the Greek and Latin do
give vauntage as in Datur, given, you would feign it should: then must it of
force give vauntage here, for none of them does place the words otherwise. And
you your self have affirmed before: that with those words Christ did
consecrate.

Yea, though you would deny it, and affirm that Christ did consecrate by his
almighty power, using some other words of blessing. Yet your school men will
not suffer you. Part. 3. quest. 75. Art. 7.
For Thomas Aquinas says. Dicendum est, quod haec conuersio, sicut dictum est,
perficitur per verba Christi, quae a sacerdote proferuntur: ita quod vltimum
instans prolationis ver borum, est primum instans in quo est in sacramento
corpus Christi. We must say, that this conversion, as it is said, is finished
by the words of Christ, pronounced by the priest: so that the last instant of
the pronouncing of the words, is the first instant wherein the body of Christ
is in the sacrament.

Nicholaus de Orbellis, Richardus, Scotus, and the rest: The school Doctors
overthrow Watsons assertion.
be all of the same mind in this matter. Wherefore me thinks, I may
certainly conclude, even upon your own words, that if Christ offered to his
father, before he brake and gave to his Disciples: he offered none other thing
but bread and wine, and therefore not his body and blood.

Now, let us see, what reason it is, that you think you may well make for the
proof of this sacrifice in the Mass. The value of Watsons reason.
Christ's action, is our instruction. But Christ did this, and commanded us so
to do. Ergo in the Mass, we do and ought to do sacrifice. etc. Your Mayor
and Minor, are proved both false: Ergo, your conclusion, is not worth a couple
of Walnuts.

And for further proof that Christ offered himself in his last supper:
WATSON. Division. 23
I shall allege unto you the authority of the Church, and the consent of the
fathers in this point, which ought to suffice any christen man.

Ireneus. li. 4.
Ireneus writes in his fourth book, that Christ taking the creature of bread
and gyuing thanks said. This is my body, and likewise confessing the cup to
be of his blood. Noui testamenti nouam docuit oblationem, quam Ecclesia ab
Apostolis accipiens in vniuerso mundo offert deo, de quo in duodecim Prophetis
Malachias sic praesignificauit, Non est mihi voluntas in vobis. etc. He taught
the new oblation of the new testament, which oblation the Church receiving of
the Apostles, does offer to God throughout the whole world, whereof Malachy
one of the twelve prophets did prophecy. I have no will and pleasure in you.
etc.

What can be more plain then that Christ in his last supper in the
ministration of the blessed sacrament did teach his Apostles the new oblation
of the new Testament, and his Apostles taught the Church the same that they
received, and the Church does contynually use to offer the same to God in every
place?

This authority the words being so manifest, and the author so ancient and
substantial, can not be avoided with all their cauillations.

Saint Cyprian also the blessed Martyr writes thus. Si Christus summus
sacerdos sacrificium Deo patri ipse primus obtulit, Ciprian. li. 2. epist. 3.
and hoc fieri in sui co^memorationem praecepit, vtique ille sacerdos vice
Christi vere fungitur, qui id quod Christus fecit imitatur. If Christ the high
priest did first himself offer a sacrifice to God his father, and commanded
the same to be done in his remembrance verily that priest does truly occupy
the office of Christ, that by imitation does the same thing that Christ did.

This holy Martyr teaches us, that Christ did first offer himself to his
father in his supper, and also commanded us to do the same. Why should any
man doubt of that, that in the beginning of the Church the holy Martyrs did,
and taught without all doubt.

Hesichius. lib. 2. cap. 8.
Hesichius also that flourished in the time of Gratian the Emperor writes
thus. Prius figuratam ouem coenans cum Apostolis, postea suum obtulit
sacrificium, and deinde sicut ouem semetipsum occidit. Christ in his supper did
first eat the figurative lamb with his Apostles, then he offered his own
sacrifice, and after that he killed himself like a lamb.

By this saying that Christ killed himself, is meant, that Christ voluntarily
did offer himself to the death, suffering the Jews to kill him whom he might
have withstanded: but to our purpose. It is plain that beside the bloody
oblation upon the cross, and also beside the figurative oblation of himself
in the paschall lamb, he also did offer himself mistically in the celebration
of the sacrament, which is the very point that we go about to prove, and is
manifestly proved by this ancient author.

Damascen says: In nocte in qua seipsum obtulit, Damascenus. li. 4. Cap. 14.
testamentum nouum disposuit. In that night when he offered himself, he did
ordeyne and institute the new Testament. Mark that he says, he offered
himself in the night, the oblation upon the cross was in the midde day, which
is a distinct offering from that in the night. And Theophilactus says: Tunc
immolauit se ipsum ex quo tradidit discipulis corpus suum. Theophilactus in
Math. Cap 28.
It is manifest that then he offered himself, when he delivered to his
disciples his body: teaching us, that Christ in his mystical supper offered
himself to his father. To this saint Augustine bears witness, writing thus.
Vnde ipse dominus etiam quos mundauit a lepra, ad eadem sacramenta misit,
August. de baptismo. li. 3. cap. 19.
vt offerrent pro se sacrificium Sacerdotibus, quia nondum eis successerat
sacrificium quod ipse post in ecclesia voluit celebrari pro omnibus illis: For
which cause our Lord himself sent them whom he had made clean from their
lepre to the same sacraments (of the old Testament) that they should offer to
the priests a sacrifice for themselves, because as yet that sacrifice did not
succeed to them, which Christ would have celebrate in his Church instead of
all them. Way these words well, and ye shall perceive, that they can not be
understand of the sacrifice of Christ upon the cross, which was but once
offered, and can not be continually celebrate and used of the Church, nor yet
of the sacrifice of thankesgyuing, which succedeth not the other, but was
before and with the other: and therefore they prove plainly, that this one
sacrifice of the new Testament that succedeth the multitude of the old
sacrifices, is only the sacrifice of Christ's body and blood in the blessed
Mass which he has ordained to be daily frequented in his Church to the
worlds end.

Dionisius Ariopagita. Specul. cap. 3.
What should I allege more authors? Will ye yet hear one of the eldest, I
mean Dionisius Areopagita S. Paul's scholar, and Bishop of Athens, he writes
thus: Quocirca reuerenter simul and expontificali officio post sacras diuinorum
operum lauds quod hostiam salutarem (quae supra ipsum est) litet, se excusat,
ad ipsum primo decenter exclamans, tu dixisti, hoc facite in meam
commemorationem. Wherefore the Bishop reverently and according to his pastoral
office, after the praise and commendation of Gods works and benefits, he does
excuse himself, that he does take upon him to offer that sacrifice of our
savior which is far above his degree and dignity, crying first unto him
decently.

Lord thou did command, saying: Do this in my remembrance. If there
were no more but this one authority, it were sufficient to prove, that the
priest does offer the body of Christ, which is the sacrifice of our savior in
the Mass, and that he offers it by the express commandment of Christ,
saying. Do this in my remembrance, and that he offers that thing, which is
far exceeding his degree, which can be nothing else, but the body of Christ.

Therefore leaving for shortness of time all other authorities, which with
little labor I could bring in for this purpose, me think I may well conclude,
that the oblation of Christ's body and blood in the Mass is the very sacrifice
of the Church, both by the institution of Christ declared by his express
commandment, which we are all bounden to obey, and also by his own example
in offering himself under the forms of bread and wine, which we priests are
bounden to follow, as the scripture which I have alleged, does evidently prove,
the true sense whereof is as is recyted not private, proceeding from mine own
brain, but catholic, confirmed by the consent of the Church, able to prove
and convince any one man, that has nothing to say to the contrary but his bare
nay.

To prove that Christ offered himself in his last supper: CROWLEY. Ireneus.
lib. 4. Capit. 32.
ye allege matter out of the ancient fathers. And first out of Ireneus. For
answer whereunto I refer the reader, to that answer that I have made to
the same text, cyted in the fourth division of your former Sermon.

And for answer to that which you cite out of Cyprian, I refer the reader
to that which I have answered to matter that you have in the ninth division of
that Sermon, Cyprian. lib. 2 Epist. 3.
cyted out of the same Epistle.

Isychius by the report of John Tritemius, Isychius. lib. 2 Capit. 8.
flourished in the days of the princes Arcadius and Honorius: somewhat after
the days of the Emperor Gratian, in whose time you say, he flourished. But
your care is, to cause him to seem as ancient as may be. But if you had read
him through, and weighed him well: you would never have cited him for your
purpose. For he does in many places make manifestly against you.

In the place that you do now cite: Papisticall liberty used by Watson.
you do use your old slight. That is, you leave out, that which goes before,
and that which follows, and should show the meaning of the writer: And
because Secundo, seems not to give you that advantage, that you desire to
have: you are bold to thrust Deinde, in place thereof, saying thus. Et deinde
sicut ouem. etc. Where the Author has, Et secundo. etc.

But that the reader may be able to judge of the Authors meaning: I will let
him see those words that you have so slily slipped over. His words be these.
Nihil autem ad perfectum duxit lex: subintroductio autem maioris spei quae data
est, in hac nos spe constituit. Veruntamen, sacrificium hoc, eam quae dicta est
mayor Spes, per quam semper propinquamus ad seruiendum Deo, innuit. Cur autem
Aries secundus, hic nunc Aries nominatur? Quia videlicet, prius figuratam ouem
cum Apostolis caenans Dominus: postea suum obtulit sacrificium, and secundo
sicut ouem ipse semetipsum occidit, quod demonstrant sequentia. Posueruntque
Aaron and filij eius manus suas super caput eius. Quem cum immolasset Moses.
Necessary simul cum Aaron filij eius, super Caput Arietis manus imponunt: quia
communem caenam festiuitatis paschalis, cum suis Christus discipulis
celebrauit. etc. The law has brought nothing to perfection, but ye secret
bringing in of a greater hope, which is given us: has set us in this hope. But
this sacrifice does note unto us, that hope, which is called the greater hope,
whereby we do always approach to serve God. And why is this Ram now named
the second Ram? Forsooth, because the Lord supping with his Apostles: did
first offer the figurative Lamb, and afterward he did offer his own
sacrifice, and did secondarily kill himself even as a sheep, which thing, the
words that follow do declare. And Aaron and his sons, did put their hands
upon the head of that Ram. Which when Moses had offered: the sons of Aaron
did of necessity set their hands upon the head of the Ram with Aaron, because
Christ did celebrate a common supper of the feast of Easter with his Disciples.
etc.

Now let the reader consider how faithfully you handle this place of Isychius.
He expounding the eight Chapter of Leuiticus, What is meant by the second Ram.
does (when he comes to those words. Obtulit and Arietem secundum. etc.)
declare that that second Ram, did signify our Savior Christ. Who after he
had with his disciples, celebrated a common supper of the solemnization of the
passover, eating with them the figurative Lamb: did, as it were, kill and
offer up himself upon the cross, because he gave himself into the hands of
his enemies that fastined him to the cross, which Isychius calls our savior
Christ's own sacrifice. And you (M. Watson) will needs have us think, that
our Savior did after the offering and eating of the passover, offer his own
sacrifice in bread and wine, and afterward offer himself on the cross, and
that Isychius means so to teach in the words that you cite. And to cause the
words, the better to seem to serve for your purpose: you do in the place of
the Aduerbe Secundo, use Deinde: which all wise and learned men do know to be
but homely dealing. But that Isychius was not of your mind concerning the
sacrifice of the Church: the reader may well see, Isychius li. 1. Capit. 1.
by that which he writes in his first book and first Chapter. His words be
these. Quia sacrificia Deus a nobis pro nostra salute vult, non ipse ea opus
habens: satis nos Paulus commonefacit. Ait enim. Obsecro itaque vos fratres,
per misericor diam Dei, vt exhibeatis corpora vestra hostiam viuam, sanctam,
Deo placentem, racionabile obsequium vestrum. Ergo placens sacrificium Deo,
corporum nostrorum mortificatio est: simul enim in eo lucramur, and quod a
peccato abstineamus, and quod virtutes acquirimus. Paul does sufficiently
certify us, that God having no need thereof: will have sacrifices of us, for
the health we have received. For he says. I beseech you therefore brethren,
even by the mercy of God: that you would give your bodies, a sacrifice, quick,
holy, and acceptable to God, which is your reasonable serving of God. The
mortification of our bodies therefore: is the sacrifice that pleases God. For
we do therein, both win that we may abstain from sin, and also that we
obtain virtues.

By these words it is most manifest, Isychius does not agree with Watson.
that Isychius understood not that place that you have taken for your theme, as
you do show your self to understand it. And that therefore he was not of such
mind in the other place that you cite out of him for your purpose: as you
would feign have men think that he was. He knew no mo sacrifices of Christ
but one, which was offered on the Cross once for all, whereof the Passover lamb
was a figure, and our sacrament is a remembrance. And the mortification of our
bodies, is the sacrifice of thanksgiving, that God does continually require at
our hands.

As for your Damascenus, although John Tritemius, Tritem. de Eccles. scrip.
Damasc. li. 4. Capit. 14.
would feign have him seem more ancient: yet John Patriarcha
Hierosolomitanus, writing his life, says that he lived in the days of Leo
Isaurius, which was.720. years after Christ. His authority therefore, can not
be so weighty, that it might enforce us to grant, that all that he writes is
true, though he dissent both from the writings of other more ancient fathers,
and scriptures also. As in that Chapter out of which you cite his words, and
in many other places of his writings, he does most manifestly.

But let us see how honestly you apply his words that you cite. Mark, say
you, that he says, he offered himself in the night. etc. I would gladly be
short in these your unhandsome handlings of that which you cite for your
purpose: but I can not suffer the Reader to lack those words that do give
light to that which you do so subtly cite. Damascenus says thus. Cibus vero
ipse panis vitae, Dominus noster Jesus Christus, qui ex Coelo discendit. Nam
suscepturus voluntariam pro nobis mortem, in nocte in qua seipsum obtulit:
testamentum nouum disposuit sanctis Discipulis and Apostolis, and per ipsos,
omnibus alijs in seipsum credentibus. etc. Certes, that food which is the
bread of life, is our Lord Jesus Christ, which came down from heaven. For
when he would for our sakes, take upon him a voluntary death. He did in the
night wherein he offered himself, dispose to his holy Disciples and Apostles,
and by them to all other that believe in him, a new testament.

Watsons fallace opened.
He offered himself in the night, say you, but the oblation on the Cross was
in the mid day: Ergo, they be distinct oblations. All that do understand what
Logic means, do know wherein the fallace of this Argument is, he offered
himself to death, and he offered himself in death. How the first can be
called a sacrifice, I would gladly learn: otherwise then the obedience of a
Christen man to do the will of God, may be called a sacrifice. But that will
not serve your purpose here. For you must have this first offering to be a
Massing sacrifice propiciatorie: both for the quick and the dead. Whether
Damascenus can justly be taken to mean so here: I refer to the judgment of
the indifferent Reader.

But this I must tell you, that in the same place, he fights against your
opinion of Datur, it is given, for he says Frangetur, it shall be broken.
Whereby it is manifest, that he means there, of the sacrifice that was made on
the Cross, and not of a sacrifice then presently offered: as you would have us
think that he meant.

Theophilact. in Mat. 28.
Theophilactus, a writer of like antiquity and integrity of judgment with
Damascenus, has said (say you) Tunc immolauit. etc. The Reader shall see the
words that go before, and then let him judge, how these serve your purpose.
He says thus. Possum tibi and aliam causam dicere, quomodo tres dies and tres
noctes numerentur. Attend igitur. Quinta vespera fecit Dominus Coenam, and
Discipulis dixit Accipite, commedite, hoc est enim corpus meum. Et ita quia
potestatem habebat ponere animam: manifestum quod tunc immolauit seipsum, ex
quo tradidit corpus suum. I am able to show thee another reason also: how the
three days and three nights may be numbered. The Lord made his supper the fifth
day at eeuen, and he said to his Disciples: take, eat, this is my body. And
so because he had power to leave his life: it is manifest that he did then
offer himself, even from that time wherein he gave his body to his Disciples.

Because (says he) our Savior had power to leave his life at his pleasure: it
is manifest that even then he offered himself, when (say you) he delivered to
his disciples his body: but, to say as Theophilactus writes, even then, from
that time wherein he gave his body. etc.

To prove that Christ had been three days and three nights in the grave, when
he arose from death: Theophilact. seeks shifts where none needs.
Theophilactus uses this shift, affirming that Christ's death began at his
supper, so that by this man's judgment, he was but a dead man, when he stood
and answered before Pilate and the rest. One other such shift he used before in
the same Chapter, saying that the darcknesse that happened by the Eclips that
was at the time when Christ gave up the ghost, must be taken for a night: and
the time that was between that darkness and the natural night, for a day.
But other more ancient then he, and of better credit: have affirmed and well
proved, that by the figure Synecdoche (whereby the part is named for the whole)
the prophecy may be well understood to be fulfilled. Which figure is very
much used of the Prophets.

Wherefore, I may conclude, that Theophilact goes about to teach us that
thing that other men have taught us before his time, in better order then he
does: and that you would make us believe that he teaches us that, which he
never meant to teach.

But mysdoubting the credit of Theophilact: you bring in Austen for a
witness, of that which you say Theophilact has taught. His words be these.
Vnde ipse Dominus. etc. For which cause our Lord himself. etc. I need not to
trouble the reader with many words, in proving that you have done great wrong
to Saint Austen: in that you bring him in as a witness of your false doctrine.
I will only add to that which you have cited out of him: those five words
that do immediately follow the same. By which five words: the Reader may
easily understand, how well ye do apply saint Austens words to your purpose.
Austen against Watson in the same place that he cyteth.
The five words be these. Quia illis omnibus ipse prenunciabatur. Because that
by all those sacrifices: he himself was showed or spoken of before. Yea, the
learned reader, that will read that place of saint Austen, shall easily
perceive: that it makes manifestly against you. For as the sacrifices of the
old testament, were not the sacrifices of the Scribes and Phariseis, but Gods,
although abused by them: so are not the sacraments of Christ your sacraments,
though you have abused them, but they are Christ's, and therefore we do,
according to saint Austens doctrine, take them to us in such sort as Christ did
institute them, leaving to you all those fond ceremonies that you have
invented, to furnishe out Christ's sacraments after your fashion. Which when
you have clouted together, you call your blessed Mass. Which, not Christ, but
Antichrist: has ordained to be daily frequented in his Church, so long as God
will suffer it so to be.

Dionisius Areopagita. Cap. 3. Specul.
But Dionisius Areopagita, was Paul's scholar. etc. He says thus Quocirca
reuerenter simul. etc. For the authority that this Dionisius is of: I have
said something in the answer to 33. division of your former Sermon. It
forces not much what his opinion is in this matter: although you would have
us to think, that his authority alone is enough. But let us see how you
handle him in citing his words for your purpose. You follow not the Greek: but
that rude and corrupt translation, that goes abroad under no name. I must
therefore trouble the Reader with the Greek text: enterpreting the same after
the true signification and use of the words. Dionisius has said thus in
Greek. (...). Which in Latin is thus. Watson had no leisure to look in the
Greek.
Quocirca reuere^ter simul and sacerdotaliter, post sacros Hymnos de
admirabilibus dei operibus: pro sacrificio pro ipsis se excusat, prius ad eum
pie exclamans. Tu dixisti, hoc facite in meam reminiscentiam. In English it is
thus. Wherefore he (that is to say, the chief Minister) does both reuerendly
and priestly, after the holy Hymns concerning the merueilous works of God,
excuse himself for the sacrifice that is offered for them, first crying out
unto him after a godly manner. Thou have said, do this in the remembrance of me.

The Translatour that you follow, knew not bylyke, that (...) being joined with
the Genitive case, does not signify super, or supra, above, but Pro, for:
neither could he put difference between (...) and (...): the one being the
Accusative case singular, and the other, the genitive case plural. And
therefore he translateth super ipsum: instead of pro ipsis. Above him, instead of for them. And you following his folly: do conclude. That the thing
that is above the degree of the priest: must needs be the body of Christ. Thus
you see how one folly brings in another.

As you did therefore, for shortness of time, leave al other authorities: so it
might have been more for your honesty, to have left this also, and to have
concluded with S. Paul to the Hebrews. Per ipsum ergo offeramus hostiam laudis
semper Deo, Hebr. 13. The conclusion that Watso^ might with more honesty have
made.
id est fructum labiorum confitentium nomini eius. Beneficentiae autem and
co^municationis, nolite obliuisci, talibus enim hostijs, conciliatur Deus.
Through him therefore, let us always offer unto God, the sacrifice of praise:
that is the fruit of lips that do praise his name. Forget not loving
liberality, and the making other partakers of the gifts you have received,
for with such sacrifices is God pleased.

But shamelesly, you boast, that you have proved both by the institution of
Christ, and the consent of the Church: that the Mass is the very sacrifice of
the Church, where as the Reader may by that which I have answered, easily
perceive, that you have both the institution of Christ, the consent of the
ancient Church, and all good reason against you, and nothing for you, but the
bare assertion of your self and such as you be.

WATSON Division. 24
Beside the institution which were sufficient for this matter, seeing in the
doctrine of faith, the proof depends upon the weight of one place, and not
upon the number of many: yet I shall allege unto you the prophecy of Malachy,
where it is prophesied before, that God would refuse and reject the sacrifices
of the Jews, and that he would call unto his grace and mercy the Gentiles, in
whose church there should be one pure and clean sacrifice, succeeding all the
other, and offered in every place, which can be none other but this one pure
sacrifice of Christ's body in the Mass. Malachias. 1.
The place is this. Non est mihi voluntas in vobis, and munus non suscipiam de
manu vestra: ab ortu enim solis vsque ad occasum magnum est nomen meum in
gentibus, and in omni loco sacrificabitur and offeretur nomini meo oblatio
munda. I have no will and pleasure in you, and I will receive no offering or
reward of your hand. For from the rising of the Sun to the setting, my name
is great amongs the Gentiles, and in every place there shall be sacrifice done,
and a pure and clean oblation shall be offered to my name.

This place is very plain for the detesting of the Jews, the rejecting of
their sacrifices, for the vocation of the Gentiles, and for the pure and one
singular sacrifice, that amongst them shall be offered to almighty God in
every place in steed of the other. This must needs be the sacrifice of the
Mass, or else let them that say nay, show of what other that place is meant.
And in very deed some have bestowed all their wit and learning, writhing and
racking this place to make it serve to some other sacrifice beside the Mass,
but it will not be, the truth has ever prevailed. Some have drawn it to the
spiritual inward sacrifices of good men's hearts: but in the understanding
they be overthrown, for the place speaks precisely of one sacrifice, and the
other spiritual sacrifices be many, and so many as there be hearts of good men
to offer them. And yet speaks also of one pure and clean sacrifice, but all
the righteousness of man is imperfect, vnpure, unclean, and compared to a
filthy cloth of a sick woman, and it speaks of such one pure sacrifice as
should succeed and follow in the place of the other sacrifices of the Jews,
which God rejects and abrogateth.

But the inward spiritual sacrifices of good men have been offered and used
before the law, in the law, and after the law, from the time of Adam till
the worlds end. Wherefore it is not possible, that this place should be
directly and only understood of the spiritual sacrifices. There be other
also that wrest it, and would have it mean only of the bloody sacrifice of
Christ upon the cross. But that can not be, the words be so plain to the
contrary. For although that be one and pure sacrifice, yet it was not offered in
every place, as Malachy says it shall, and also it was offered only among the
Jews upon the mount of Caluarie, where the prophet says, this sacrifice he
speaks of, shall be offered in every place among the Gentiles.

Therefore to conclude, this is a plain prophecy, declaring the will of God
to have all the sacrifices of the Jews to cease, and in the Church of his new
people the Gentiles to have this one pure sacrifice of Christ's body and blood
in the Mass to be frequented in every place, wherewith he is well pleased and
contented.

And in this sense Ireneus takes it, Ireneus. lib. 4. Capit. 32.
whose words in Latin I alleged a little before, that Christ confessing the
cup to be of his blood, did teach the new oblation of the new testament,
which the Church receiving of the Apostles, offered to God throughout the
world, of the which Malachie one of the twelve prophets did speak before. I
have no will nor pleasure in you, and so forth. As I have recyted before,
manifestly declaring that the old people should cease to offer to God, and
that the new people shall offer unto him one pure sacrifice in every place.

Chrysostom also says. Et in omni loco sacrificium offeretur nomini meo,
Chrysostom. in Psalm. 95.
and sacrificium purum. Vide, quam luculenter, quamque dilucide, mysticam
interpretatus est mensam, quae est incruenta hostia. And in every place a
sacrifice shall be offered to my name, and that a pure sacrifice. See how
evidently and how plainly he does interpret the mystical table, which is the
unbloody sacrifice. I need not to open this place any more, being so plain as
it is.

August. contr. Iudaeos.
Saint Augusten writing against the Jews says thus. Aperite oculos tandem
aliquando, and videte ab orient sole vsque ad occidentem, non in vno loco, vt
vobis fuit constitutum, sed in omni loco offerri sacrificium Christianorum: non
cuilibet Deo, sed ei qui ista praedixit, Deo Israel. Open your eyes at last you
Jews, and see from the rising of the sun to the setting not in one place as
it was ordained amongs you, but in every place to be offered the sacrifice of
christen men, not to every God, but to him that prophesied these before the God
of Israel.

The like sayings he has writing upon the.106. Psalm, and in his book Contra
Aduersarium legis. li. Capit. 20. which I omit, least I should be tedious to
you, and to curious in so plain a matter.

CROWLEY. Both the institution and the prophecy make against Watson.
Besides the institution, which makes against you: you do now allege the
prophecy of Malachie: which makes nothing for you. So handsomely do you handle
your self, in proving that you entende.

In mine answer to the fourth division of your former Sermon: I have
sufficiently opened the meaning, both of Malachie and Ireneus. I need not
therefore in this place to write any further answer. What men they be that
have bestowed all their wit and learning, in writhing and racking this place of
Malachie, to make it serve to some other sacrifice beside ye Mass: you do not
tell us here. Wherefore, I need not to spend any time in examining their
doyngs therein.

Hierome in Malach. 1.
Saint Hierome was no wryther nor racker, I am sure: and yet he expounding this
place of Malachie says thus. Et nequaquam taurorum, hircorumque sanguinem: sed
thymiama, hoc est, sanctorum orationes Domino offerendas. etc. Not the blood of
Bulls and Goats, but sweet odours, that is the prayers of holy men, shall be
offered to the Lord. etc.

But Chrysostom. words upon the Psalm. 95. Chrysostom. in Psalm. 95.
are so plain that they need no more opening, say you. See, says he, how
plainly Malachie the Prophet, does interpret the mystical Table, which is the
unbloody sacrifice. Well, the reader shall see the words that follow
immediately in the same place. Thymiama vero purum, appellat sacras preces,
quae post hostiam offeruntur. Hic enim suffitus Deum refocillat. Non is qui a
terrenis radicibus sumitur: sed qui a puro cord exhalatur. And he calls the
holy prayers that are offered after the sacrifice, pure incense. For this
sweet perfume is a refreshing to God. Not that which is taken from the roots
that grow in the earth: but that which is breathed out of a pure heart.

In mine answer to the ninth division of your former sermon: I have noted out
of this same Chrysostom, in his.17. Chrysostom. in Epist. ad Heb. ho. 17.
Homily upon the Epistle to the Hebrews, that the fathers used to call the
sacrament of the body of Christ a sacrifice, and yet they understood it to be
but a remembrance of that sacrifice that Christ offered on the Cross once for
all.

Of which sacrifice, that same Chrysostom writes in this same Homily that you
cite upon the.95. Psalm, saying. Omnino magnus erat and modo carens, numerus
sacrificiorum in lege: quae omnia, noua gratia superueniens, vno complectitur
sacrificio, vnam ac veram statuens hostiam. The number of sacrifices in the
law was very great, and without measure: which the grace that is come upon
us, does comprehend all in one sacrifice, appoynting but one true sacrifice.
That this is spoken of that one sacrifice, that Christ did offer on the Cross
once for all: is plain by that which does immediately follow. For he says.
Habemus autem and nos in nobis ipsis, varias immolationes. etc. And we also
have in our selves, sundry offerings, which do not proceed according to the
law: but are such as be seems for the Evangelical grace. Will thou know
these sacrifices which the Church has, when the Evangelical sacrifice does
without blood, without smoke, without Altar and other ceremonies ascend up
unto God, and what the pure and undefiled sacrifice is? Hearken to the holy
scripture, which does plainly expound unto thee, this difference and variety.
The first sacrifice therefore, is that which I have spoken of before, that
spiritual and mystical sacrifice, whereof Paul says thus. Be ye folowers
of God, as dearly beloved children, and walk in love, even as Christ has
loved us. etc.

What sacrifices ye church offers to God.
And after this he makes a short rehersall of all those sacrifices, that the
Church of Christ has to offer to God, and he says thus. Habes igitur primum
sacrificium illud salutare donum, secundum Martyrium, tertium deprecationis,
quartum iubilationis, quintum iusticiae, sextum elemosinae, septimum laudis,
octauum compunctionis, nonum humilitatis, decimum praedicationis. Thou have
therefore the first sacrifice, which is that healthful sacrifice, the second
martyrdom, the third of prayer, the fourth of rejoicing after victory, the
fifth of righteousness, the sixth of almose, the seventh of praise, the eight of
inward sorrow for sin, the ninth of humility, the tenth of preaching.

By this it is manifest, that when Chrysostom speaks of one sacrifice that
comprehends all the sacrifices of the old law: he means that one
sacrifice that Christ did offer in his own person once for all. And when he
speaks of those sacrifices that the Church has to offer to God: he means
of such as be offered without blood, without smoke, without Altar, and without
other ceremonies. He means therefore nothing less, then to maintain your
massing sacrifice.

August. cont. Iudeos.
The words that you cite out of Austen contra Iudaos: make nothing for you. For
he speaks there of that sacrifice: that I have here declared Chrysostom to
speak of. As does right well appear by that which follows in the same book.
For he says. Accedite ad eum qui ante oculos vestros glorificatur, ambulando
non laborabitis: ibi enim acceditis, vbi creditis. Come unto him that is
glorified in your presence, it shall not be painful for you to walk, for you
do come unto him even there, where ye do believe. And again he says. Come let
us walk in the light of the Lord: because his name is great among the
Gentiles. And in the place that you say you omit, least ye should be tedious.
etc. S. Austen says thus. Incensum enim, quod greece thymiama, August con^
aduers. legis. lib. 11. cap. 20.
sicut exposuit Johannes in Apocalipsi, orationes sunt sanctorum. etc. For the
incense, which in Greek is called Thymiama, as saint John does expound it in
his Revelations: are the prayers of the Saints. Least I therefore should be
tedious, and to curious in so plain a matter: I omit much that might be
brought against your assertion: both out of Austen in the places that you have
here cited, and other of his works, and also out of the rest of the fathers.

Ye have heard the thing proved by the Gospel, by the Prophet, WATSON
Division. 25.
now hear the proof of the figure taken out of the law. The Psalm says.
Tues sacerdos in aeternum, secundum ordinem Melchisedech. Psalm. 109.
Thou art (meaning Christ) a priest after the order of Melchisedech.

Melchesedech was a priest of the most highest God, as appears both by his
words and factes, in that he blessed Abraham, and also received tithes of him,
whose oblation was bread and wine, which he offered to God meeting with
Abraham coming from the spoil of the kings. Gene. 14.


As for such fond cauillations, as some make for that the book says, non
obtulit, sed protulit, I let pass, as things nothing furthering their
purpose, nor yet hindering ours.

This is plain by saint Paul, that every Bishop and Priest is ordained to
offer sacrifice. Hebr. 8.
If Christ our savior be a Priest, and that after the order of Melchisedech,
as the Psalm, and saint Paul do witness, Psalm. 109.
then it must needs follow, that Christ had some thing to offer, which is
nothing but himself, and to no creature but to God, which he was himself,
seeing every sacrifice is that honor that is due only to God And that he
offered himself after the order of Melchisedech, which must be under the
forms of bread and wine. For that was the order and manner of Melchesedech.
Which kind of offering he never made, except it were in his last supper, and
for that cause and reason we may conclude that Christ in his supper did offer
himself to his father for us, not by shedding of his blood by death, which was
the order and manner of Aarons offering, but without shedding of his blood under
the fourmes of bread and wine which was the order of Melchisedech.

And that this is not my private collection, but the mind of all the ancient
fathers, I shall with your patience recite their sentences.

Cyprian li. 2. Epist. 3.
Saint Ciprian says, Qui magis Sacerdos Dei summi, quam dominus noster Jesus
Christus qui sacrificium deo patri obtulit, and obtulit hoc idem quod,
Melchisedech, id est, panem and vinum, suum scilicii corpus and sanguinem. Who
is more the Priest of the highest GOD then our Lord Jesus Christ who offered a
sacrifice to God the father, and offered the same that Melchisedech did, that
is to say, bread and wine, that is to say his body and blood.

And a little after he says: Qui est plenitudo veritatem praefiguratae
imaginis adimpleuit. Christ which is the fullness fulfilled the truth of this
image that was figurate before.

By these places of Ciprian we learn, that Melchisedech and his offering were
figures of Christ, and his offering in his supper, and like as Melchisedech
offered bread and wine, so Christ being the truth offered his body and blood
under the forms of bread and wine. And least any man should be offended with
that Cyprian says, hoc idem quod Melchisedech, the same that Melchisedech.
Hear what saint Hierom says more plainly. Quomodo Melchisedech obtulit panem
and vinum, sic and tu offeres corpus tuum and sanguinem, verum panem and veru^
vinum. Hiero. in Psalm. 109.
Like as Melchisedech offered bread and wine: so thou shall offer thy body and
blood, the true bread, and the true wine.

The other was the figurative bread and wine, this is the true bread and
wine, the truth of that figure, not the same in substance, but the same in
mystery.

Paula Epist. ad Marcella^.
The same saint Hierome among his Epistles has an Epistle of the godly matrone
Paula ad Marcellam. wherein be these words. Recurre ad Genesim and
Melchisedech Regem Salem. Huius principem inuenies ciuitatis, qui iam tunc in
tipo Christi panem and vinum obtulit, and misterium Christianum in saluatoris
sanguine and corpore dedicauit. Return (says Paula) to the book of Genesis
and to Melchisedech the king of Salem, and thou shall find the prince of that
City, which even then in the figure of Christ offered bread and wine, and did
dedicate the mystery or sacrament of the Christians in the blood and body of
our savior.

Mark in this most manifest place the oblation of the figure, which is bread
and wine, and the oblation of the truth, which is the mystery of us Christen
men, the body and blood of our savior Christ.

And it is to be noted, what is meant by this word (order) which saint Hierome
expounds thus. Hiero. question in Genesim.
Mysterium nostrum in verbo ordinis significauit, nequaquam per Aaron
irrationabilibus victimis immolandis, sed oblato pane and vino.i. corpore and
sanguine domini Jesus. By this word (order) he did signify and express our
mystery, not by offering of unreasonable and brute beasts as Aaron did, but
by the oblation of bread and wine, that is to say, the body and blood of our
Lord Jesus.

After this fathers mind, order is taken for the manner of offering, not by
shedding of blood, but vnbloudily, as we offer Christ's body and blood in our
mystery. For Christ's offering, concerning the substance of it was but one,
but concerning the order and manner it was diverse, upon the cross after the
order of Aaron, in the supper after the order of Melchisedech. For so saint
Augustine says: August. in Psalm. 33.
Coram regno patris sui, id est, Iudaeorum mutauit vultum suum, quia erat ibi
sacrificium secundum ordinem Aaron, and postea ipse de corpore and sanguine suo
instituit sacrificium secundu^ ordinem Melchisedech Before the kingdom of his
Father, that is to say the Jews, he changed his countenance, for there he
was a sacrifice after the order of Aaron, and afterward he did institute the
sacrifice of his body and blood, after the order of Melchisedech.

Mark the diversity and distinction of these two offerings of Christ, not in
substance but in order, that is to say, the manner: and that Christ did
institute the sacrifice of his body and blood to be offered of us after the
order of Melchisedech, which thing he expresses more plainly in an other
book expounding a place of Ecclesiastes. Non est bonum homini nisi quod
manducabit and bibet, August. De Ciuitate Dei. li. 17. Cap. 20.
saying thus. Quid credibilius dicere intelligitur, quam quod ad
participiationem mensae huius pertinet, quam and sacerdos ipse mediator noui
Testamenti exlabit secundum ordinem Melchisedech de corpore and sanguine suo?
Id enim sacrificium successit omnibus illis sacrificijs veteris testamenti quae
immolabantur in vmbra futuri. What is more credible we should think he meant by
those words, then that pertayneth to the participation of this table, which
Christ himself a priest and mediator of the new Testament does exhibet after
the order of Melchisedech of his body and blood? For that sacrifice did
succeed all the other sacrifices of the old Testament, which were offered in
the shadow of this to come.

What can be playner then this to show the figure of our mystery to be
abrogated, and the truth which is our sacrifice in the body and blood of
Christ in form of bread and wine to succeed.

Oecumenius in Epist. ad Hebreos.
But to end this matter, hear one place playnest of all which Oecumenius has
upon this place of Saint Paul. Tu es sacerdos in aeternum etc. in these
words. Significat sermo, quod non solum Christus obtulit incruentam hostiam
(si quidem suu^ ipsius corpus obtulit) verum etiam qui ab ipso fungentur
sacerdotio, quorum Deus pontifex esse dignatus est sine sanguinis effusione
offerent. Nam hoc significat (in aeternum.) Neque enim de ea quae semel a deo
facta est oblatio, and hostia dixissit inaeternum, sed respiciens ad presents
sacrificos, per quos medios Christus sacrificat and sacrificatur, qui etiam in
mystica coena modum illis tradidit huiusmodi sacrificij. The word means,
that not only Christ offered an unbloody sacrifice, for he offered his own
body, but also that they which under him use the function of a priest (whose
Bishop he does vouchsafe to be) shall offer without shedding of blood. For that
signifies the word (evermore.) For concerning that oblation and sacrifice,
which was once made of God, he would never say (evermore.) But having an eye to
those priests, that be now, by whose mediation Christ does sacrifice and is
sacrificed, who also in his mystical supper did by tradition teach them the
manner of such a sacrifice.

This authority if it were any thing doubtful, I would stand in it to open
such points, as were contained therein but being so manifest as it is, it
needs no more, but to desire the hearer or reader to wey it, and he shall see
this matter we go about to prove, fully resolved both by the institution of
Christ in his last supper, and also by the figure of Melchisedech in the old
law. This aucthorities although there be many mo, yet I think them
sufficient, and I think thereby the matter sufficiently proved.

Neither by the Gospel, nor by the prophet have ye proved, CROWLEY.
the thing that you took in hand to prove: no more does that which you would
have your Auditorie harken to here, prove the figure taken out of the old
law, in such sort as you affirm it.

Saint Paul, writing to the Hebrews: Hebr. 7.
goes about to diswade them from the vain confidence they had in the
sacrifices and ceremonies of Moses law, and to persuade them to put their
trust in that one only sacrifice that Christ had made, offering himself once
for all. And least they should reject his doctrine as having no ground in the
holy scriptures: he puts them in mind of Melchisedech, who was a figure of
Christ. And of his priesthood: which was also a figure of Christ's priesthood.
First, he was a figure of Christ (says saint Paul) in that he was called
Melchisedech, which is by interpretation, The mind of Paul in making mention
of Melchisedech.
the king of righteousness, and the king of Salem, which is, the king of
peace. And in that he was a priest of the most high God, and has neither
beginning nor end of days noted in the holy hystories: his priesthood seemed
to be an everlasting priesthood. And therefore (says saint Paul) he is
lykened to the son of God that is everlasting, and has an everlasting
priesthood, and is always able to save them that seek salvation at his hand,
because he lives ever to make intercession for us.

This is the mind of saint Paul, as may easily appear, to as many as will
with indifferent minds read that which he has written in the seventh Chapter
of his Epistle to the Hebrews. But contrary to this meaning, do you most
wylfully gather: that Melchisedech was a figure of Christ and of his
priesthood, in that he used to offer to God, a sacrifice of bread and wine.
This you suck out of your own fingers, and out of the dugs of such dreaming
Doctors as you your self are: although you would seem to have learned all that
you speak, in the school of Cyprian Austen, Hierome, and such other ancient
and learned fathers.

Cyprian li. 2. Epist. 3.
Cyprian says, Qui magis Sacerdos Dei summi etc. Here does Cyprian affirm
that Paul has written to the Hebrews, concerning Christ's priesthood and
sacrifice. If Melchisedech were a priest of the most high God, because he
offered sacrifice to God: why should not Christ be a priest of the same high
God, seeing he has offered sacrifice to the same high God also? And if
Melchisedech did offer bread and wine: John. 6.
Christ did the same, for he offered his own body and blood, which is lively
bread and wine, the food that feeds into everlasting life. When this place
is well weighed: what advantage can you have by it, to prove that Christ
offered himself to his heavenly father, in the bread and wine of his last
supper? The reader may see more of this, in that which I have answered to the
ninth and tenth divisions of your former Sermon.

As touching the understanding of the words a little after, where Cyprian
says. Qui est plenitudo. etc: I refer the reader to the words that follow a
little after them. Where Cyprian uses the words of wisdom spoken by
Solomon, Proverb. 9.
in this wise. Qui est insipiens declinet ad me and indigentibus sensu dixit.
Venite and edite de meis panibus, and bibete vinum quod miscui vobis. Vinum
mixtum declarat, id est Calicem Domini aqua and vino mixtum, prophetica voce
denunciat, vt appareat in passione dominica id esse gestum, quod fuerat
praedictum. Wisdom (says Solomon) sent forth her servants, saying. Let him
that is foolish, turn in unto me. And to such as lack understanding she
said. Come and eat of my bread, and drink the wine that I have mixed for
you. She declares (says Cyprian) that the wine is mixed. That is to say,
she does with the voice of prophecy declare, that the Lords cup is mixed
with water and wine: that it might appear that in the Lords passion, that
thing was done in deed, which had been told of before.

By these words of Cyprian, it appears plainly: that the cause why he would
have water mixed with the wine in the celebration of the Lords supper, was to
show that the prophecy which Solomon uttered in the person of wisdom, was
fulfilled in the passion of Christ, when water and blood did issue out of his
side. And also to imitate the example of Christ: who (as Cyprian supposes) did
not drink wine without the mixture of water. His whole purpose therefore in
this Epistle, Cyprians purpose in his Epistle to his brother.
being to disprove the doing of those which used to minister with water without
wine: he sought for many figures in the old Testament, which might seem to be
prophecies of Christ's ministration in his last supper. And he applies them to
prove: that water alone could not serve to signify that which Christ would
have to be signified by it. And (as in such case it may easily happen) when he
finds a figure, wherein mention is made of such mixture: he imagines that
Christ mixed water with the wine, and he conceyueth in his mind, that the wine
must signify Christ, and the water, the people. And so he makes as great a
matter of the omitting of the water, as he did before, of the leaving out of
the wine. Not remembering, that he had at the first applied to his purpose, Noes
drinking of wine, and Mechisedechs bringing forth of bread and wine: where
there is no mention at all, of water mixed with the wine.

But as I have written in mine answer to the.24. division of your former
Sermon: let us not forget the words of Erasmus, in the Epistle that he wrote
before the works of Hilarious: Erasmus in Epistola ad Lectorem Hilarij.
which are these. Nemo, quantumuis eruditus and oculatus. etc. There is no man
be he never so well learned and circumspect, that does not slip, and in some
point show himself to lack sight, that no man should forget them to be men:
and that we should read them with choice, with judgment, yea and with favor
also, as men. Words worthy to be printed in memory, and practiced in the
reading of all men's wrytings.

Now, fearing least some man should mistake the words of Cyprian when he
says. Hiero. in Psalm. 109.
Hoc idom quod Melchisedech: you cite the interpretation that saint Hierome
makes upon the psalm.109. to prove that Christ offering his own body and
blood in his last supper, did offer the same thing that Melchisedech did, not
in substance, but in mystery. I will let the reader see, what Hierome has
written: immediately before and after the words that you cite. First he says
thus. Superfluum est nos de isto versiculo velle interpretari: cum sanctus
Apostolus ad Hebreos plenissime disputauit. Ipse enim ait. Iste est
Melchisedech, sine patre, sine matre, sine generatione. Et interpretatur ibi
diligentissime: quare sine Patre. etc. It is a thing superfluous, for us to go
about to make an interpretation of this verse, seeing that the holy Apostle has
in his Epistle to the Hebrews, reasoned this matter at the full. For he says.
This (that is to say Christ) is Melchisedech: Wherein Christ is like
Melchisedech.
without father, without mother, and without generation. And he does there most
diligently enterprete: wherefore he is without father, without mother, and
without generation. And all ecclesiastical persons do say. That Christ is
said to be without father in that he is man, and without mother, in that he is
God. Let us therefore interpret this only: thou art a priest for ever after
the order of Melchisedech. Let us only declare this thing. Wherefore he has
said: after ye order. According to the order, is as much as to say. Thou shall
not be a priest according to the Jewish sacrifices: but thou shall be a priest
after the order of Melchisedech. And then follow those words that you have
cyted. Quomodo enim. etc. And immediately after those words he says. Iste
Melchisedech, ista mysteria quae habemus dedit nobis. etc. This Melchisedech,
has given us these mysteries that we have. It is he that said. He that eats
my flesh and drinks my blood. He has given us his sacrament: after the order
of Melchisedech.

No indifferent reader can judge, that saint Hierome means here to teach,
that Christ did at his last supper, offer his body and blood, under the forms
of bread and wine, as you affirm. But as Melchisedech did offer bread and
wine, so Christ should offer upon the cross, his own body and blood (which is
the true bread and true wine) and give us a sacrament, to be frequented in the
remembrance thereof.

But in that Epistle, that Paula and Eustochium wrote unto Marcella: You have
found a most manifest place. Paula and Eustoch. ad Marcellam.
Recurre ad Genesim, and Melchisedech (say they) etc. Here I must tell you,
that where you do in the English make Melchisedech, the Dative case, and in
the Latin, put the point Periodus, after Salem: you show your self not to
understand the grammatical sense, which is thus. Return to the book Genesis,
and thou shall find, that Melchisedech king of Salem, was Prince of this
City, which even then. etc.

Men of your sort, are very near driven: Watson is near driven.
when they allege women's words or wrytings, for proof of matters so divine,
as is that which in this Sermon you treat of. But grant it were Saint Hierome
himself, that wrote that Epistle: might not Melchisedech offer bread and wine
in a figure of Christ, and dedicate the mystery of Christians: but it must
needs follow, that Christ did at his last supper, offer his own body and blood
under the forms of bread and wine, as you do affirm? I think none that is
learned in Logic will grant that argument.

But (as you have slightly touched before) the book has not Obtulit, but
Protulit. He brought forth bread and wine. Watson makes light of that which he
is not able to weigh.
As lightly as you let pass, the reasons that men make against your opinion,
by the vauntage that the text gives being Protulit, and not Obtulit: neither
you nor any of your sort, shall ever be able to answer, otherwise then by
calling them fond cauillations, as you do.

In the Latin, these two Verbes are sometime used, both in one signification:
but Profero, is never found in that signification, that you and such other do
use Offero, when you speak of Melchisedechs coming forth to meet Abraham,
and offering him bread and wine, to refreshe himself and his company withal.

The Hebrew interpretors, who do best know the signification of the words of
that tongue, wherein that hystory was first written: do teach that it was the
manner in those days, for such as remained at home in peace, to come forth
against them that returned from battle with victory, bringing with them
bread and wine, to refreshe the weary Soldiers withal, and so receive them
friendly.

Antiquit. li. 1 Capit. 18.
Josephus, a Jew borne, and so well learned in the Jews laws, and histories,
that he was able to write a continual history of the antiquity, laws and
ceremonies of the Jews, and of their wars: does when he comes to this part
of the history, write thus. Suscipitque cum rex Melchisedech, quod significat
rex iustus, and erat vtique, and sine dubio talis: ita vt propter hanc causam,
etiam Dei sacerdos esset Solimorum, quam Ciuitatem postea Hierosalymam
vocaueru^t. Ministrauit autem iste Melchisedech, Abraham exercitui xenia, and
multam abundantiam rerum oportunarum simul exhibuit: and super epulas eum
collaudare caepit, and benedicere deum, qui ei subdiderat mimicos. Abraham vero
dante ei etiam decimas spoliorum, munus accepit. And he was received of king
Melchisedech, which signifies a righteous king, and verily and without all
doubt he was such a one: so that for that cause he was also Gods priest in the
City Solyma, which City men did afterward call Hierosolyma. And this
Melchisedech did minister gifts to the army of Abraham: and he did also give
them great abundaunce of things needful. And as they were at meat: he began
to praise him, and to bless God, which had subdued his enemies to him. And
when Abraham gave him the tithes of the spoil: he received the gift.

Hiero. ad Euagrium. John. 3.
Saint Hierome in his Epistle ad Euagrium, does prove that the City Salem,
whereof Melchisedech was king: was not that which was afterward called
Jerusalem, but that Salem that is mentioned in the Gospel, where John
baptized because there was plenty of water there. He does therefore disprove,
not only Josephus, but also all Christen writers: for that they suppose
Melchisedech to have been king of that City, which was called Jerusalem
after his days, but in his days Salem.

He allows the judgment of those which do suppose that Melchisedech was the
first son of Noe, and that he lived after Abraham's death.35. years at the
least (which is easy to be seen by the supputation of the years from the
birth of Sem, to the death of Abraham, which is.565. years, and the whole time
of Sems life, is.600. years) but failing somewhat in the supputation, he says
that Sem lived after Abraham.40. years.

He allows also the opinion of Josephus and other, which think that
Melchisedech brought forth bread and wine, to refreshe Abraham and his
servants, in their return from the slaughter of the kings. Yea, and for
this matter that you make so light of, he cites the Hebrew text: translating
the Hebrew verb Hotzi, Protulit, not obtulit, thereby making his judgment of
that place manifest.

If you can prove that Hierome or any other writer, have in this place used
obtulit in any other sense, then protulit is here used in the plain text: I
must be bold to use Hieroms own words against himself and the rest. In his
Commentary upon Math he says: Hoc quia de scripturis non habet authoritatem,
In Math. 23.
eadem facilitate contemnitur, qua probatur. Because this thing has none
authority of the scripture: it is as easily contemned, as allowed. And in his
Apology of his books against Iouinian he says. Apolog. lib. aduers. Ioui.
Commentatoris officium est, non quid ipse velit, sed quid sentiat ille quem
interpretatur exponere. Alioqui, si contraria dixerit: non tam interpres erit,
quam aduersarius, eius quem nititur explanare. Certe, vbicunque scripturas non
interpretor and libere de meo sensu loquor: The duty of a good interpreter.
arguat me cui libet, durum quid dixisse contra nuptias. It is the duty of
one that does comment upon the wrytings of other, to expound, not what he
himself lusts: but what the meaning of him is, whom he does enterpret.
Otherwise, if he shall say contrary: he shall rather be an adversary, then an
interpretour of him whom he would explane.

Truly, whenever I do not interpret the scriptures, but do freely utter
mine own meaning: let him that lusts reprehend me, as one yt has vttred
some hard saying against marriage.

Yet one other place you cite out of Hierome, Hiero. quest. in Genesim.
to underprop your Popish priesthood withal. Mysterium nostrum. etc. By this
word (order) he did signify. etc. If you had been disposed to deal plainly,
you would have joined the former part of the Oration with the latter: and not
have picked out the latter to serve your purpose: leaving out the first.

Melchisedechs blessing declared.
Saint Hierome says that the Apostle saint Paul, in his Epistle to the
Hebrews, making mention of Melchisedechs being without father and mother: does
refer it unto Christ, and by Christ, to the Church of the Gentiles. For
(says he) the glory of every head, is referred to the members, because one
that was not circumcised, did bless Abraham that was circumcised: and in
Abraham he blessed Leui, and by Leui, he blessed Aaron of whom the priesthood
did afterward come. Whereof he would have us gather, that the priesthood of
that Church that was not circumcised: did bless the circumcised priesthood of
the Synagoge. And then follow the words that you should have cyted. Quod autem
ait, Tu es sacerdos in aeternum secundum ordinem Melchisedech: Mysterium
nostrum in verbo ordinis significatur. etc: as you have cyted. Our mystery is
signified (says saint Hierome) but you tell not upon what occasion he said
so. Where as the Apostle says (said saint Hierome) thou art a priest after
the order of Melchisedech: our mystery is signified in the word, order. Not
by Aaron in offering up sacrifices of unreasonable beasts: but by bread and
wine that was offered, that is the body and blood of the Lord Jesus. Thus
far saint Hierome.

You must needs grant, that our mystery, is our coupling together into
members of one body in Christ, whereof saint Paul speaks to the Ephesians.
When he says. Mysterium hoc magnum est, Ephesians. 5.
ego autem dico in Christo and Ecclesia. This mystery is great says Saint
Paul: but I speak it of Christ and the congregation. Of the same speaks
saint Austen in his Sermon Ad Infantes. Where he says thus. Vos estis corpus
Christi and membra: Si ergo vos estis corpus Christi and membra: mysterium
vestrum in mensa Domini positum est, Citatur a Beda in collect.
mysterium Domini accipitis. Ad id quod estis, amen respondetis. etc. You are
the body and members of Christ. If you therefore be the body and members of
Christ: your mystery is set upon the Lords table, you receive the Lords
mystery. To the thing that you your selves are, you answer Amen. And in
aunswering you do subscribe.

This mystery was not signified by Aarons sacrifices (says saint Hierome):
but by the bread and wine, that Melchisedech brought forth to refreshe Abraham
and his Soldiers withal. 1. Cor. 10. August. in Ioh. Tract. 26.
Which bread and wine was the body and blood of the Lord Jesus: even as the
Manna that fell from heaven, and the water that issued out of the rock were the
same.

Your application of this place of Hierome, might well have been spared
therefore: if you had dealt plainly with your auditory. For it is now manifest
to the reader: that saint Hierome meant nothing less, then to teach that
Christ offered himself once at two times, and after two orders: The order of
Melchisedech declared
but he buyldeth upon saint Paul's words, who says that Christ was not a
priest to offer after Aarons order, but after the order of Melchisedech, an
eternal and everlasting sacrifice.

Now must Austen help you to patch out this matter. August. in Psalm. 33. and De
Ciuit. Dei li. 17. cap. 20.
Upon the title of.33. Psalm, he says thus. Coram Regno Patris sui. etc. And
upon this sentence of Ecclesiastes, Non est bonum homini. etc: he says thus.
Quid credibilius dicere. etc.

If saint Austen should in these two places teach, as in your application, you
do bear your Auditorie in hand that he does teach: Watson would have Austen
teach false doctrine.
then were his doctrine most false and contrary to the Evangelical history.
For where as the Gospel says, that Christ did institute the sacrament of his
body and blood, the night before he suffered: saint Austen must say (if you
apply his words aright) that he did first suffer, and then institute the
sacrament of his body and blood afterward.

But I will not for your pleasure conceive such an opinion of Austen: for I
know he was far from that shameful error and open falsehood. He taught
truly, that in the time of the old law among the people of the Jews: Christ
was a sacrifice after the order of Aaron, for by every bloody sacrifice, was
the death of Christ plainly set forth, to as many as had eyes to look, and se
through the shadow of the law. But after al those sacrifices that were offered,
in the shadow of a thing to come: he prepared a sacrifice after the order of
Melchisedech, that is everlasting, and that of his own body and blood, which
is the food that feeds into everlasting life.

And that this is saint Austens meaning: is plain by that which in the book
that you cite, De Ciuitate Dei, he adds to the words that you cite. His
words be these. Propter quod etiam vocem illam in psalmo tricesimo and nono,
eiusdem mediatoris per Prophetam loquentis, agnoscimus sacrificium and
oblationem noluisti, corpus autem perfecisti mihi, quia pro illis omnibus
sacrificijs and oblationibus, corpus eius offertur, and participantibus
ministratur. Wherefore (says saint Austen) We do acknowledge that voice of the
same Meditatour, speaking by the Prophet in the Psalm.39. in this wise: thou
have not desired sacrifice and oblation, but thou have made me a perfect body,
for his body is offered instead of all those sacrifices and oblations, and is
ministered to such as be partakers thereof.

The continual offering of Christ.
This sacrifice, because it is eternal after the order of Melchisedech, is
still presently offered by the Meaditor Christ: who is both the priest and
sacrifice, and continually ministered, to them that be partakers thereof by
faith, by that spiritual manner of ministration, whereby spiritual life, is
ministered from the head Christ to his members the Church.

But now, to end this matter: your Auditorie must hear one place more, which
is playnest of all. Oecumenius has said, Significat sermo. etc. If I might use
such liberty in cyting places, as you do in this: I could easily find plain
places enough to prove whatsoever I lusted to take in hand. Where the author
has said Significat sermo, quod licet Christus non obtulerit carentem
sanguine hostiam (siquidem suum ipsius corpus obtulit) attamen qui ab ipso
fungentur sacerdotio. etc. The signification of this saying is: that although
Christ did not offer a sacrifice without blood (for he offered his own body)
yet shall those that shall after him execute the office of priesthood (whose
high priest God does vouchsafe to be) offer without blood. For that is
signified by this saying. For ever. etc.

These be the words of Oecumenius: as Hentenius has translated them out of
the Greek. But you had promised your Auditorie a playner place then this was
being thus translated. For this is plain against all that you have done
before, in proouing that our Savior Christ did offer himself without blood.
For this fellow being thus translated, says: Although Christ did not offer a
sacrifice without blood. etc.

Well therefore, to make the place plain in deed, you have amended the
translation, I trow, and you have said: Significat sermo, quod non solum
Christus obtulit incruentam hostiam (siquidem suum ipsius corpus obtulit) verum
etiam qui ab ipso. etc. The word means, that not only Christ offered an
unbloody sacrifice (for he offered his own body) but also they that shall
under him use the function of a priest (whose Bishop he does vouchsafe to be)
shall offer without shedding of blood. Well, either you, Oecumenius belyed in
translating.
or your friend Hentenius have belyed the Greek. For here is plain
contradiction. The one says. Has not offered: and the other says, has
offered. Wherefore, it must needs follow, that the one has made a lie. And
peradventure if the Greek might be seen and well viewed: you might be found
false harlots both (for Hentenius was a Louanist. etc.) For who so reads the
rest that Oecumenius has collected out of other writers that were before his
time, and patched together into one commentary upon the Epistle to the
Hebrews: he shall have but little occasion to think that Oecumenius could be
of such mind concerning the meaning of these words, Tu es sacerdos in
aeternum, thou art a priest for ever: as in this place that you cite, he
shows himself to be, when he says, Christ could not be said to be a priest
for ever, but in respect of those sacrifycing priests that are now, by whose
means he does still offer and is offered. For upon the tenth Chapter and these
words, Singulis annis, he says thus. An ne nos semper offerimus hostias
sanguine carentes? sed vnius eiusdemque mortis Christi memoriam facimus, and
vnum Christi corpus, semper edimus. Do we always offer sacrifices that have
no blood? But we do make a memorial of that one and the self same death of
Christ, and do always eat one body of Christ. And upon the word Perpetuo, he
says: Quum vna perpetuo sufficiat. Seeing yt one sacrifice may suffice for
ever. And upon these words. In certitudine fidei, In the certainty of faith:
he says thus. Quoniam autem nihil est post haec visibile: neque templum, id
enim est caelum, neque Pontifex, is est Christus, neque victima, haec corpus
est ipsius: necessaria in posterum est fides. Verum quia contingit credere
simul and haesitare, ait. In certitudine fidei. Hoc est, vt certisimus de his.
Oecumenius his meaning made plain.
Because that hence forth there is nothing visible, neither temple, for that is
heaven, neither high priest, for that is Christ, neither sacrifice, for that is
his body: faith is from this time forward necessary. But because it does
happen, that a man does at one time, both believe and doubt: he says in the
certainty of faith, that is that we may be certain of these things.

Many such sayings as this are in that Commentary: wherefore, corrupting of
the Author in translating may be suspected: as well on the behalf of
Hentenius, as you, although your doing do more appear then his. But grant
that Oecumenius have written in Greek: even as you have reported him in
Latin. Is he known to be of such antiquity and authority in the Church:
that his gloss must be of more authority and credit, then the plain words of
the text? Saint Paul says. Iam non est oblatio pro peccatis. There is now no
oblation for sins. Seeing Christ has by one oblation made perfect, such as be
sanctified: what needs there any more offering for sin? For the cause of
the continuance of the offering, was the imperfection of the offerings, which
could never take away sin, but always put the offerers in mind of one that
was to come, who should be able by one oblation once offered, fully to take
away the sins of the whole world. Oecumenius may have no credit against
saint Paul.


Your Oecumenius therefore, being a great many of hundred years after saint
Paul (as may justly be gathered, by that he wrote after so many of the Greek
writers as he names in his book) should now be credited in that which he
writes contrary to saint Paul, if that should be believed as taught by him,
which you would so feign maintain by his words.

Your false dealings therefore, being so plain as it is: I need not to stand
upon the opening of it any more, but only to desire the reader to weight the
matter, and he shall see, that the matter that you go about to prove: is not
resolved at all, either by the institution of Christ, or by the figure of
Melchisedech. You must therefore allege other Scriptures and authorities:
before your matter can be sufficiently proved.

Other Scriptures there be though not so plain, WATSON Division. 2^
yet they conteyne an argument to prove the same as this of Saint Paul. Non
potestis participes esse mensae domini and mensae demoniorum. 1. Cor. 10.
Ye can not be partakers of our Lords table and the table of devils. The
word (table) here is taken for the meat of the table. For men be not
partakers of the material board, but of the meat that is ministered upon the
board. Now the table of devils is taken for that meat that is offered to Idols
in which devils did reign, and therefore that meat was called in Greek.
Idolothyton, meat offered to Idols. Now this is certain by all good learning
that in every comparison there must needs be a proportion and similitude,
wherein the things compared must agree, then whereas these two tables be
compared in offering and eating, it must needs follow, that if the table of
devils be a very sacrifice made to devils in deed, the table of our Lord
likewise must be a sacrifice, offered to our Lord in deed. And if our Lords
table be a very sacrifice made to him by us, then have we our purpose proved
and confessed.

The like argument may be made of the word (aultare) in saint Paul. Habemus
altar de quo edere non habent potestatem, Hebr. 13.
qui tabernaculo de seruiunt. We have an aultare, of which they may not eat
that serve the tabernacle.

If aultare and sacrifice be so annexed together, that the one cannot be
without the other, then when saint Paul says, we have an aultare, speaking
also of the eating of that aultare, he must needs mean the sacrifice made upon
the aultare: so that our sacrament before we eat it, is also a sacrifice.

For so does Theophilactus take this place. Theophilact. ad Heb. Capit. 13.
Et nos inquit obseruationem habemus, haudtamen in esculentes hisce, sed in ara
sieve in hostia illa incruenta and corpore vitam clargiente. And we also have an
observation, yet not in these common meats, but in our aultare or vnbloudye
sacrifice, which gives life to our bodies.

Here we may see, that he means by the aultare the unbloody sacrifice of
Christ's body, which being eaten of us corporally in the sacrament gives life
to our bodies.

Moreover if time would serve me, I could make an argument of Daniels prophecy
of the coming of Antichrist because he says, Dani. 12.
that in that time the continual sacrifice shall be by Antichrist taken away,
per tempus, tempora, and dimidium temporis, by the space of three years and an
half as many take it.

Whether this shall be done all Christendom over at one time, or in every
particular region at diverse times, it is not certainly known to us, and
therefore I will not certeynly determine it. But this is certain, that
Antichrist can not take away the sacrifice of Christ upon the cross, which was
but once made, and shall never be iterate nor frustrate. Nor he can not take
away the inward spiritual sacrifice of man's heart, which then shall flourish
most of al in the elect. For why should they then fly to the mountains, (as
the book says) but that for the vehemency of the persecution, they might
more fervently do spiritual sacrifice to almighty God.

Therefore it follows that the sacrifice of Christen men is such an one, as
may be taken away by Antichrist, which in my judgment can be nothing else, but
the sacrifice of the Mass, or else let them tell what other sacrifice it is
beside the Mass.

Ye se now, what Scriptures I have brought to prove the oblation of Christ's
body in the Mass to be the sacrifice of the Church and new Testament, which
has been assaulted many ways of many men. But to the oppugnation of it they
never yet to this hour alleged any one direct scripture nor doctor, nor good
reason. They have gone about it, and by tyranny in some places they have
prevailed for a time, but always truth the daughter of time has ouercommed.

For lack of plain scriptures, CROWLEY
you allege such as you say do contain arguments to prove the popish
Mass to be a sacrifice. etc. And first you begin with saint Paul, where he
says: Non potestis. etc. The Argument that you find in this scripture, 1.
Cor. 10.
is thus. If the table of devils be a sacrifice made to devils in deed: then
must the table of the Lord be a sacrifice offered to the Lord in deed. But
the table of the devils is so: Ergo, the Lords table must needs be so. And so
is your purpose proved and confessed.

If you were in the divinity school, and should in disputation be put to
prove the mayor proposition of this Argument: Watsons mayor is not current in
the schools.
it would not slip away so smoothly as it did when you spoke it in your
sermon. For it would be made plain to you that you build this reason upon a
false supposition. For where you suppose the table of Devils, and the table of
the Lord to be compared in offering and eating: it would be proved to you by
the sayings of ancient writers, that the comparison is in the society of the
eaters, with them at whose tables they eat.

Theophilactus whose judgment you should trust in this place (for you make him
you only stay, Theophi. in 1. Cor. 10.
in that which you cite out of saint Paul to the Hebrews) upon these words of
Paul. Nolo autem vos participes fieri Demoniorum, I would not that you should
be made partakers of ye devils: says thus. Si enim mysticam me^sam
participantes, Christo communicant, eique vniuntur: Daemonum mensam
participantes, Daemonibus haud dubie communicant. If they that be partakers of
the mystical table, do communicate with Christ and be joined into one with
him: without doubt such as be partakers of the table of Devils, do communicate
with devils. And upon the words that you cite, he says. Ex solis nominibus
probat, non esse comedenda Idolis immolata. He does by the names alone, prove
that we should not eat those things that be offered to Idolles.

Here it is manifest, Wherein the tables be compared
that Theophilactus understands saint Paul to make comparison between the
table of Devils, and the Lords table: in the society of the partakers, with
them at whose tables they be partakers. As they which be partakers at the
Lords table, do show themselves thereby to be joined to the Lord in society
and unity: so they that be partakers at the Idols table, do show themselves
to be in society and unity with the Idols.

Chrysostom, writing upon the same place: is of the same mind. And so are
Ambrose and Hierome. And to be short. As many as have written upon this place:
do understand saint Paul to mean of the society and unity, that the
eaters have with them, at whose table they do eat. And the argument that saint
Paul uses, is a Contrarijs, of the contraries. And therefore some of the
interpreters do compare the speech that he uses here to that which our savior
Christ uses in the sermon that he made in the mount. Math. 6.
Non potestis Deo seruire, and Mammoni. You can not serve God and Mammon. The
argument therefore, that you would have us think to be contained in this
scripture: is very far from the meaning of the place that you say it is
contained in.

No form of reasoning observed by Watson.
But what need I to spend any time in disprouing the parts of this Argument:
seeing it is but a mere Cauillation, following no right form of Argumentation.
For this is an infallible rule in Logic (as you know I am sure) that of
mere particulers, there can no necessary consequence follow. But the
antecedents in this argument are mere particulers: Ergo, the conclusion can
not necessarily follow thereof.

The like argument, you say, may be made, of the word altar in saint Paul to
the Hebrews, where he says, Habemus altar. Hebr. 13.
etc. We have an altar. etc. The argument that you say is contained in this
place of scripture, is thus. If altar and sacrifice can not be the one without
the other, then saint Paul speaking of eating the altar, must needs mean,
the eating of the sacrifice made on the altar. But altar and sacrifices are
so annexed together. etc. Ergo, Saint Paul speaking of the eating of the
altar, must needs mean. etc. This argument is like the other, and therefore
must be denied by the same rule. And so shall not this argument prove, that our
Sacrament is a sacrifice before it is eaten.

Theophilact. in Epist. ad
But Theophilact. say you, does so take this place. For he says. Et nos inquit.
etc. And we (says saint Paul) have an observation. etc. Heb. 13.
Either you fellow some corrupted copy of Theophilacts Commentary: or else you
have of purpose corrupted the place your self. For Johannes Lonicerus,
following an ancient Greek copy: has translated it thus. Nos inquit,
obseruationem habemus, verum haud eam quae sit in huiusmodi cibis, sed super
altari, sieve impoluta and immaculata hostia viuisici corporis. We (says Saint
Paul) have an observation, but not that which is in such manner of meats, but
upon the altar, or the undefiled and unspotted sacrifice of the body that
quickneth or gives life. Here is no word that may signify unbloody
sacrifice. Neither is there any place in this saying to conteyne an argument,
to prove that the sacrament is a sacrifice before it is received. Neither does
Theophilactus take this place in any such meaning. But he understands saint
Paul to mean of the Communion of the body and blood of Christ, when he
says. Habemus altar. etc. We have an altar. etc. Which Communion
Theophilact. calls, Theophilactu meaning made plain.
the undefiled and unspotted sacrifice of the quickening body: following the
custom, that then was common among the fathers. That was to call the
sacraments by the names of those things whereof they were sacraments. This
observation have we that be Christians, whereof the ministers of the Tabernacle
(that is to say, such as believe not in Christ, though they be Jews) can not
be partakers. Yea though they should be partakers of the outward observation:
yet could they not have any part of that quickening body that Theophilact.
speaks of, because they remain in incredulity or unbelief, as he says
afterward in the same Chapter, where he speaks of the sacrifice of
thanksgiving for the blood of Christ.

Here the Reader may see that Theophilact. does in this place mean nothing
less, then such an unbloody sacrifice as you speak of. But rather he may be
understood to mean of such an unbloody sacrifice as saint Austen speaks
of, when he says thus. Tunc enim ordinem legittimum consecrationis altaris cum
gaudio celebramus: quando altaria cordis vel corporis nostri, munda and pura,
August ser. de tempore.
in conspectu diuinae maiestatis offerrimus. Then do we with joy celebrate the
lefull order of the consecration of the altar: when we do in the presence of
God, offer the altar of our own heart and body, clean and pure.

Chrysostom also writing upon the same place: may seem to mean of the same
sacrifice. He writes thus. Number enim and nos inquit, Paul's words expounded by
Chrysosto^e.
illa non custodimus? Custodimus enim and vehementius: neque ipsis sacerdotibus
ex his quicquam dantes. Do not we (says saint Paul) observe these things.
Truly we do observe them, and that more earnestly, neither do we give any
part thereof to the priests. Of what other sacrifice can this be spoken, then
those that be offered upon the altars of our own bodies and hearts, that is,
meditations and works of obedience to God. Whereof we give no part to our
selves that be the priests and offerers: but altogether to him that we offer
this sacrifice to, according to the order of offering that sacrifice, the blood
whereof the high Priest offered for sin, whereof the Priests had no part
for their fee, but all the whole was burnt with fire. For it is God alone that
works in us both the good will, Phil. 2.
and the performance thereof: and therefore, the whole praise is to be ascribed
to him, and no part to be given to us.

So far off are these ancient fathers, from maintayning your carnal
opinion, of the corporal eating of Christ's body in the sacrament thereof.
But if time would have served you, you could have made an argument of Daniels
prophecy. etc. Well, as time would suffer, you bungle up a reason: and thus
you say. Antichrist can not take away the sacrifice that Christ offered on the
Cross, nor the inward sacrifice of man's heart: wherefore it is the Mass that
is the continual sacrifice, Watson has time enough to prove his arguments.
and must be taken away by Antichrist. I deny your argument. Granting you as
much time for the proof thereof, with the other two that go before: as you
your self will take.

And because you would have us tell you, what other sacrifice besides the
Mass, it is that Antichrist may take away: I will tell you what sacrifice it is
in my judgment, and then let the indifferent reader be judge betwixt my
judgment and yours.

In my judgment, the contynuall sacrifice that Antichrist may take away from
the Church of Christ: is that which saint Paul speaks of when he says.
Hebr. 12. What sacrifice Antichrist may take away.
Per ipsum igitur offerrimus sacrificium laudis semper Deo: hoc est fructum
labiorum confitentium nomen eius. Through him therefore, we do always offer
unto God, a sacrifice of praise: that is, the fruit of those lips, that do
confess his name. This sacrifice, has Antichrist of Rome taken away from the
universal Church of Christ in taking upon himself the title of universal
head of the same Church, which title is due to Christ only, and in taking upon
him the authority and power, to remitte and pardon sins, which power
belongs to God only. The fruit of those lips that confess his name is
taken away: when none may without peril of death, confess that Christ only
is the universal head of his Church: and that God only, in his son Christ
and for his sake, does freely forgive and pardon sins. Thus you have my
judgment of a sacrifice contynuall, that may be taken away by Antichrist: and
yet is not your Popish Mass.

The three years and half also, may well be applied to the times, wherein the
power of Rome has taken away this sacrifice by cruel persecution: so that
very few or none in all the known world, durst offer this sacrifice to God.
Now let the indifferent reader be judge between your judgment and mine, in
this matter of a continual sacrifice, that may be taken away by Antichrist.

But that Daniell meant there to prophecy, that Antichrist shall take away the
continual sacrifice: the text will not suffer me to think. For he says thus.
A tempore oblationis iugis sacrificij, The meaning of Daniels prophecy.
and positae abominationis desolationis: dies mill ducenti non aginta. From
the time of the taking away of the contynuall sacrifice, and setting up of the
abomination of desolation, are a thousand, two hundereth, four score and ten
days. Which is the time, two times, and half a time that he spoke of before.

The continual sacrifice of the temple, was fully ended and taken away by
Christ's one oblation of himself: 2 Thessalonians. 2.
and the abomination of desolation, is set up in the Church of Christ, the man
of sin boasting himself to be God, as does the Antichrist of Rome, which
sets up himself above all that is called God, that is above all Princes and
earthly Potentates. The space therefore between the ending of the ceremonial
sacrifices, and Christ's coming to judgment: may be a time, two times, and
half a time. That is, a long time, twice so long a time, to the fervent desire
that Gods elect have to see the end: and but half a time, that is to say, a
very short time in comparison of that everlasting time, wherein they shall
reign with Christ in glory incomparable.

Words that remain sealed.
This my judgment I submit to the judgment of the godly learned: til that time
be ended, during which (as the Angel told Daniell) those words of his must
remain sealed.

Thus much have I written, to let the reader see, what scriptures you have
brought to prove the oblation of Christ's body in the Mass, to be the
sacrifice of the Church and new testament. Which as you say, many have
assaulted and oppugned with such direct scriptures and Doctors and good
reasons, that it is by them expugned, and can not be by you propugned. Not by
tyrannical power, but by simple and plain preaching of the Gospel: these men
have prevailed in many places, for a time. And Truth the daughter of Time: has
never suffered her self to be altogether overcome by Popish tyranny.

WATSON Division. 27 Heb. 9. and. 10.
Some scriptures they abuse, what they be, ye shall hear. They allege saint
Paul to the Hebrews. Semel oblatus est ad multorum exhaurienda peccata. Christ
was once offered to take away the sins of many. Vnica oblatione co^sumauit
inaeternum sanctificatos. With one oblation he has perfited for evermore all that be sanctified. These be the scriptures they allege against the Mass, and
they say Christ's oblation is perfect, no man can offer Christ but himself,
which he did but once, and never but once, as though we should say, that
Christ was crucified twice or often times.

To this objection of theirs, we answer that Christ was never offered to the
death for our redemption but once, and yet otherwise was he offered many times,
both of himself and of his creatures.

Daniell. 7.
We read in the prophet Daniell, that Angels offered him in the sight of his
father. Luc. 3. Bernard. Ser. 3. de purificatione.
And also the blessed Virgin his mother offered him at her purification, of
which offering saint Bernard says, Ista oblatio fratres satis delicata
videtur, vbi tantum sistitur domino, redimitur auibus and illico reportatur.
This oblation brethren is very delicate, where he is only presented to our
Lord, redeemed with birds, and by and by brought home again.

And therefore we answer them, that their argument is of no strength, to
confute one truth by another, when both may be true, as to reason, Christ was
but once offered upon the cross, Ergo he was not offered in the sacrament. And
we tell them, that they do not consider how Christ is offered three ways of
himself, and also three ways of man.

First he offered himself upon the cross really and corporally as I say as
says, Oblatus est quia voluit. Isay. 50.
This is manifest enough. And here their exclamations of ones ones has very
good place.

Secondly he offered himself figuratively in the paschall lamb. For the
scripture says, the lamb was slain from the beginning of the world, Apo 13.
and the fathers in the old law in all their sacrifices did offer Christ not
in substance, but in figure, and so Christ offering the paschall lamb at his
supper, offered him self in figure.

Thirdly Christ offreth himself in heaven really and so contynually, as the
same Chapter which they bring against the Mass does testify. Non in
manifacta sancta Jesus introiuit, exemplaria verorum, Heb. 9.
sed in ipsum coelum vt appareat nunc vultui Dei pro nobis. Jesus entered not
into a temple made with man's hand a figure of the truth, but into heaven, that
he might appear now to the countenance of God for us.

What is this appearing in the sight of God for us, but an offering of himself
for us to pacify the anger of God with us, to represent his wounds and all
that he suffered for us, that we might be reconciled to God by him?

This is the true and perpetual oblation of Christ in comparison of this in
heaven, the bloody oblation upon the cross is but an Image, as S. Ambrose
says: Hic vmbra, hic imago, Ambrose offi. lib. 1. Capit. 48.
illic veritas, vmbra in lege, imago in Euangelio, veritas in coelestibus: ante
agnus offerebatur, vitulus: nunc Christus offertur sed offertur quasi homo
quasi recipiens passionem, and offert se ipse quasi Sacerdos vt peccata nostra
dimittat, hic in imagine, ibi in veritate, vbi apud patrem pro nobis quasi
aduocatus interuenit.

Here (in this world) there is a shadow, here there is an image, there (in
heaven) is truth, the shadow in the law, the image in the Gospel, the truth
in heaven. Before a Lamb and Calfe were offered, now Christ is offered, but he
is offered as man and receiving passion, and he offers himself as being a
priest to take our sins away, here in image, there in truth, where with the
father as an advocate he makes intercession for us.

The same thing he writes also upon the.38. Psalm. So that it is very plain
without al controversy, that Christ does offer himself now most perfitely in
heaven for us, being our advocate to the father face to face, and as saint John
says. 1. John. 2.
Ipse est propitiatio pro peccatis nostris, he is a sacrifice propitiatory for
our sins, he says not he was, but is, and after the most perfitest manner
that can be, in respect whereof the very true and real oblation for our
redemption upon the cross, is an image.

So that by this we see by the plain scripture, that Christ offered himself
three ways, besides the oblation of himself in his supper, which is the point
we he about to declare.

And even so is he offered of man three ways likewise. First figuratively, in
the oblation of the old testament.

When Abraham being about to offer his own dear son, and by Gods provision
offered in his stead a Ram, and when Melchisedech offered bread and wine, and
the Jews the pascall lamb and their burnt offerings: what did they offer but
Christ in figure, whose passion those offerings did signify? Which offerings
did of themself work nothing inwardly, and therefore were called Iustitia
carnis, the righteousness of the flesh, but by them they did protest their
sin, and declared their faith, of whom they looked to have remission.

Secondly, we offer Christ mistically in our daily sacrifice of the Mass,
where Christ is by his omnipotent power presented to us in the sacrament, and
of us again represented to his and our father, and his passion renewed, not by
suffering of death again, but after an unbloody manner, not for this end, that
we should thereby deserve remission of our sins, but that by our faith,
devotion, and this representation of his passion we most humbly pray almighty
God to apply unto us by Christ that remission, which was purchased and
deserved by his passion before.

The host of these two sacrifices upon the cross and upon the altar, is all
one in substance, but the manner is diverse, and the end is diverse, that by
this means (as Christ himself has instituted) we might celebrate and make
commemoration of his passion. This is only the sacrifice of the priest by
public ministration, but verily and in affection it is the sacrifice of the
whole Church, which every member of the Church does use and frequent, no man
does impugn it, but he that professes open war against the Church.

Thirdly Christ is offered by man spiritually only by the meditation of our
mind, when we think and remember his passion, and in our devout prayer
beseech God to show us mercy for it.

Thus every christen man and woman, in all places and times upon the altar
his own heart, ought to offer Christ to the father, after which sort of
spiritual oblation we be all both men and women, priests and kings, being as
saint Peter says. Sacerdotium sanctum, 1. Peter. 2.
offerentes spirituales hostias acceptabiles Deo per Iesum Christum. An holy
priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

Now considering these three ways, shall it be a good argument, to inculcate
one way and to reject the rest? To allege one member of a division, to the
reiection of the other? This is the peculiar manner of the heretics the enemies
of Christ, as they did in the matter of the sacrament, by the spiritual eating
of Christ to confute and reject the real and corporal eating of Christ's body
in the sacrament.

Such shifts and fond arguments they have to seduce the unlearned withal,
which when they be espied and detected they appear as they be Deuillishe and
pernycious Sophistry.

CROWLEY.
Whereas you go about to persuade your hearers, that we abuse the words of
saint Paul to the Hebrews: your answer that you make to our objection, does
affirm that we do use those scriptures aright. Hebrews..9. Watson confirms
our allegation of ye scriptures.
For to what end has any of us alleged them, other then to prove, that Christ
was but once offered for the redemption of man's sins: and that therefore he is
not offered for sins in your popish Mass.

These be the scriptures (say you) that they allege against the Mass: as
though those scriptures were of no weight in comparison of those that you have
to allege for the Mass. Or else that they were wrested so far out of
square: that all the world might see, that they make nothing for the purpose.
But that the reader may see, that these scriptures, so alleged as they be by
us against the Mass, be of some force to prove that which we would prove by
them: I will upon these scriptures and your answer, form this reason or
argument. An argument for watson to answer.
Whatsoever action is but once done, is not done often or every day. But Christ
is but once offered for sin. Ergo, he is not offered often or every day for
sin. Disprove this argument if you can.

You would make your hearers believe, that we go about to confute one truth by
another. But I trust to cause the reader to see: that you confirm one lie by
another. We grant that it is true, that Christ was offered but once for sin:
and that that once must needs be by shedding of his blood. Romans 6. Hebr. 9.
For as saint Paul faith. Stipendium peccati mors. The reward of sin is
death. He therefore that should take away sin must die. And without the
effusion of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins. Therefore Christ that
should purchase forgiveness of sins: must needs have his blood shed,
according to the figures of the old law, which did all preach the shedding of
the blood of him that should purge us, and make us clean from sin.

We do not by the affirming of this truth: deny any other truth. But if there
be any that will say, that Christ is offered for sin any oftener then once, or
any otherwise then by death and the shedding of his blood: then do we allege
this truth (grounded upon the scriptures, and confessed by you) against that
falsehoode affirmed by such as say that Christ is offered for sin oftener then
once, or any otherwise then by death, and the shedding of his blood.

If you can find any imperfection in Christ's one oblation once offered: then
blame us, for that we say it is perfect. None can offer Christ but himself
And if you can find any man or other creature, that is able to offer Christ
for sin: then blame us, for that we say, that none can offer him for sin
but himself.

But you have found in Daniell the Prophet: Daniel. 7. Lucae. 2.
that the angels offered Christ to his father. And in Luke, that his mother
offered him at her purification. You should have alleged Hieroms exposition of
Daniels words, watsons learning and wisdom showed.
as you have done Bernarde for the other: and then men might have taken you for
such one, as you by alleging this place, for this purpose, do show your self
to be. That is neither learned nor wise. Saint Hierome says thus. Totum quod
dicitur, oblatum eum omnipotenti Deo, and accepisse potestatem, and honorem and
regnum: iuxta illud Apostoli accipiendum est. Qui cum in forma dei esset. etc.
All that which is said, that he was offered to the almighty God, and that he
received power and honor, and a kingdom: Philip. 2.
must be taken according to the saying of the Apostle. Which being in the form
of God: he thought it no robbery to be equal with God. etc.

What shameless beast would say, that Daniell saw the Angels offer Christ in
sacrifice to his father: watson was deep in his oblations.
because the text says. Et in conspectu eius obtulerunt eum. And they
presented him before him. But you were so far in your oblations: that you
could not remember that Offero has any other signification, then to offer
sacrifice. Those thousands therefore, that Daniell saw attending upon the
ancient judge, must needs make a sacrifice of Christ: because they presented
him before that judge.

And the virgin Mary because she presented her son Jesus in the temple,
according to ye law of Moses: she must needs be said to offer him in
sacrifice. Leuit. 12.
The law did not require that the first begotten son should be offered in
sacrifice: but that there should be a sacrifice offered for him. The virgin
Marie therefore coming to the temple to do for her first borne son according
to the law: did offer that offering that the law did require. The Evangelist
saint Luke, who writes the Hystorye, says that they brought Jesus to
Jerusalem, vt sisterent eum Domino, to set him before the Lord, or to make him
appear before the Lord.

Bernard. Sermon. 3. De purificae.
If Bernarde and you can prove that Sisto, does signify to offer in sacrifice:
then will I grant you, that Christ was offered by his mother as a sacrifice.
But Bernarde himself does in the same place that you cite, expound his own
meaning better then you will understand him, when he says. Offer filium tuum
virgo sacrata, and benedictum fructum ventris tui domino repraesenta. Offer thy
son (O holy virgin) and show forth unto the Lord, the blessed fruit of thy
womb. Here it appears, that in this place Bernard does by offering
understand representing, or showing forth. Yea, Bernards meaning made plain by
his own words.
the very words that you cite, do declare Bernards meaning to be other then you
would have it seem to be. For he says. Tantum sistitur Domino. He is only
set forth or represented to the lord.

And therefore we answer you, that our arguments are to strong for you to
confute, by telling us that Christ is offered three ways of himself, and
three ways of man. For we know that he was never offered for sin, mo ways
then one. But let us see how you prove these six manners of offering Christ.
First he offered himself upon the Cross, you say (and that truly) and you
prove it by the saying of Esaias. Esaias. 53.
Oblatus est, quia voluit. He was offered because he was willing so to be. In
the same Chapter is a place which some of us have alleged against the
sacrifice of your Mass: and I think will not be easily answered of you.
Which is this. Liuore eius sanati sumus. By his stripes or bruses, are we made
hole. Out of which words I reason thus. Whatsoever wound is thoroughly cured and
made hole: An argum^ against the sacrifice of the Mass
needs no further playstering. But the wound that sin gave us, is thoroughly
healed by that once offering of himself that Esaias speaks of: Ergo it is
superfluous to have any other sacrifice to cure that wound. etc

Secondly, Christ offered himself in figure, when he offered the Pascall
Lamb. And this you prove by the.xiij. of saint John's Revelations. Apoc. 13.
The Lamb that was slain from the beginning of the world. Here is no abusing
of Scriptures: when the text has relation to a thing done two thousand years
before the Pascall lamb and other sacrifices were instituted, is restrained to
prove, that the thing that it has relation to, was done by that Pascall Lamb
and other sacrifices, instituted by the law that was ordained so many years
after.

When promise was made to the first man, that the seed of the woman should
break the serpents head, How Christ has been slain from the beginning.
and that promise was believed of them to whom it was made: then was the Lamb
Christ slain unto them that believed the promise, and so has he been to as
many as have hitherto believed that promise. And the memory of this promise
has been kept, by the Pascall Lamb and other sacrifices: and the manner of the
fulfilling of it, plainly painted out, to such as could consider them with a
spiritual eye. But the offering of the Pascall Lamb and other sacrifices, was
not instituted, that the offerers might thereby offer up Christ figuratively:
but to keep in memory, the promise, and to set forth before their senses, the
manner of ye fulfilling of the promise, when the time of fulfilling the same
should come.

The Pascall also, had one special use: which was to keep in mind, the
wonderful deliverance that God wrought in Egypt, as it appears in Exodi.
Where it is written thus. Cum dixerint filij vestri: quae est ista Religio?
Dicetis eis. Exodus 12. The special use of the Passover.
Victima transitus domini est: quando transiuit super domos filiorum Israel in
Egipto, percutiens Egiptios, and domos nostras liberans. When your children
shall say, what is this Religion? you shall say unto them. It is the sacrifice
or slain offering, of the Lords passing by: when in Egypt he passed over the
houses of the children of Israel, and slew the Egyptians, and delivered our
houses.

August. de Verbis Apostoli. sermo. 6.
And saint Austen shows a another use of the old Paschall: which is to
signify the death of Christ, by slaying of the Lamb, and our emendement of
life, by the eating of it with unleavened bread. His words be these.
Celebrabatur Pascha in veteri populo, sicut nostis, occisione Agni cum Azymis:
vbi occisio ouis, Christum significat, Azyma autem, nouam vitam. Hoc est, sine
vetustate fermenti. The Pasouer was in the old people, celebrated, as you
know, in the killing of a Lamb with unleavened bread: where the killing of
the sheep, does signify Christ, and the unleavened bread, a new life, that
is without the oldnesse of leaven. And a little after he says. Venit verum
Pascha, immolatur Christus, transitum facit a morte ad vitam. Tra^situs enim
interpretatur hebraice Pascha. The true Passover is come, Christ is offered up,
he passes from death to life. For Paschal in the Hebrew, is interpreted,
passing by, or passing over.

Here is no word of the offering of Christ figuratively in the old Paschall:
but when Christ passed from death to life, then he was offered, says saint
Austen. Wherefore I conclude. That Christ did not offer himself figuratively in
the old Paschall, neither did the fathers of the old law, offer him in their
sacrifices. But as all the faithful fathers that believed the promise, did
offer passover and other sacrifices, thereby to show their due obedience to
the law of God, Why Christ would eat Passover.
by which those things were commanded to be done, trusting yt when the time
should be fulfilled, God would perform his promise: so did Christ observe al
ye points of the law, absolutely, that being free from the curse of the law,
he might deliver from that curse, those that were under it.

Thirdly, Christ offers himself in heaven, really, and so continually: as
the same Chapter that we bring against the Mass does testify (say you) Non
in manufacta. etc. Jesus entered not into a temple made with hands. etc. It
seems that you have learned some painters divinity: Painters divinity.
where you have seen Christ representing his wounds to God his father, to
move him to have compassion upon us, for whose cause he has suffered those
wounds.

That which you gather of this place of saint Paul: does show you to be very
nigh a dangerous error, if you be not already fallen into it. That is the
error of the Anthropomorphits, which supposed God to be as a man: Watson v^
nigh a dangerous e^
not only in bodily shape, but also in humane affections. As though a thing
once done could not be present with him, both before and after it is done for
ever: but must be still presented before him to move his affections by the
sight thereof, which otherwise would forget it, as a man does. How you can avoid
this, I can not see: affirming (as you do) that Christ is entered into heaven,
to offer himself for us. etc.

We have learned, both by the scriptures, and also by the ancient writers:
that there is with God neither time to come, nor time past, but all present.
The wounds of Christ were present in his sight before Adam was made: and so
are they now and shall be for ever. Christ needs not therefore, perpetually
to stand representing his wounds, Ephesi. 1.
that we might be reconciled by him: for as many as shall be reconciled to God
by Christ, were before the foundations of the world were laid, reconciled to
him in Christ, and do and shall remain reconciled for ever.

God had appointed a time, wherein Christ should work the work of our
reconciliation, which time is now past with us, but still present with him: and
he has also appointed a time wherein we that be by him reconcyled, shall enjoy
the fruit of that reconciliation, that is everlasting glory in his kingdom,
which with us is yet to come, but with him it is already present. In ye mean
season, Hebr. 10.
Christ having offered one oblation for sin (as Saint Paul says) does for
ever sit at the right hand of God: from thenceforth tarying till his enemies
be made his footestoole. For by one oblation he has made persite for ever:
those that be sanctified. That is, those which be made holy by the spirit of
adoption: Romans 8.
whereby they cry unto God, Abba father.

But you have found saint Ambrose, Ambro. li. 1. Officio. Ca. 48 and in Psalm.
38.
in two places of his works, to be of your mind: and to account the sacrifice
that Christ made upon the cross, to be but an image of a sacrifice, in
comparison of that which he makes perpetually in heaven. If Ambrose were now
living, and did know of your doing: he could not think well of you, that
would make him a maintayner of your fond opinion, of Christ's perpetual
offering of himself, drawing his words so far from his meaning.

By occasion of the words of the Prophet David, where he says. Psalm. 38.
Notum fac mihi Domine. etc. Lord, let me know mine end, and what the number
of my days is, that I may know what it is that I lack: saint Ambrose does
note, that the end which the Prophet does desire to know, is that day wherein
every one shall rise out of the earth in his order, wherein our perfection does
begin. Here therefore (says Ambrose) that is in this mortal state: there is a
let or impediment, there is infirmity, even in such as be perfect, but there
(that is in the life to come) there is full perfection. Therefore, he desires
to know, what days of eternal life, are yet remaining, not what days be
past. That he may know what he himself lacks, what the land of promise is,
which brings forth contynuall fruits, what manner dwellings, the first,
second, and third dwelling are with the father, wherein every man does rest
according to his worthynesse. We therefore (says he) must desire those things
wherein perfection is, wherein the truth is. Hic vmbra, hic Imago, illic
veritas. etc. Here is the shadow, here is the image, there is the truth. And so
forth, as you have cyted. But to the end of those words that you rehearse:
Ambrose opens his own meaning.
he adds a sentence that does make his meaning more plain. Hic ergo in
imagine ambulamus, in imagine videmus: illic facie ad faciem, vbi plena
perfectio, quia perfectio omnis in veritate. Here therefore (says Ambrose) we
walk in an image, we see in an Image: then we shall see face to face, where
there is full perfection, because all perfection is in truth.

Who would think that any man of learning, could be so blinded, as to
understand these words of Ambrose as you do? His whole purpose is to declare,
that in this mortal state: there can be no perfection in any thing. But the
most perfect things that be here: are but as images are in comparison of those
things whereof they be images. Yea, the mediation of Christ betwixt God and
man: was not without imperfection, in the image and outward show thereof. For
he suffered (says Ambrose) as a man, and as one worthyly condemned to die. And
he offered himself as a priest does offer sacrifice: to release us of our
sins. Here (that is, in the mortal state) he walked in an image. But there
(that is in the immortal state) he walks in the truth. That is, a very
Advocate, without any outward show or image of one that should not be able to
bring to pass that which he has taken in hand: that is the restoring of man
to the favor of God again.

According to this meaning does Ambrose write upon the Psalm that you name.
Ascend ergo in coelum: Ambrose i^ Psalm. 38.
and videbis illa quorum vmbra hic erat, vel Imago. etc. Clime up into heaven
therefore (O thou man) and thou shall see those things, the shadow or image
whereof was here. Thou shall see, not in part, nor in a dark speech: but in
perfection. Not under a covering: but in the light. Thou shall see that priest,
which is a priest in deed, everlasting and continual: whose images thou did
see here, Peter, Paul, John, James, Matthew, Thomas. Thou shall see him a
perfect man now, not in an image, but in power.

And to put all men out of doubt, that Ambrose means not to maintain your
mad assertion, of a perpetual oblation made by Christ in such sort as you
imagine. I will let the reader see what he writes upon the same place to the
Hebrews that you do allege. Si semel oblatus non sufficeret: etc. Hebr. 9.
If he had not been able by being once offered, to take away the sins of all
that believe in him: he must have suffered oftentimes, since the beginning of
the world. For the avoiding whereof: he did once suffer in the end of the
world, to consume utterly, the sins of many. And why of many and not of all?
Because all do not believe. etc. Here it is manifest, that Ambrose supposed
that the sins of all the faithful, were clean consumed, by that one
oblation that Christ offered once for all.

So that it is plain without all controversy: that Ambrose minded not to
teach that Christ does continually offer himself a sacrifice to his father
for us: but that the mortal state in this world, is in comparison of the
immortal state in heaven, but even as an image is, in comparison of the thing
that it does represent. As for the place that you cite out of saint John's
Epistle: is answered by that which you your self have said of the first way
of Christ's offering of himself. For you say that yt was done really, and
corporally: and that our exclamations of once, once, have very good place
there. I am sure you do not think, that this most perfect manner of offering
that you speak of here (whereof you say the first was but an image) should be
other then real and corporal. And then how serves our exclamatio^ of once,
once, in ye first: unless it do utterly exclude this last, yt you do so
greatly extol?

I know, that saint John has said Aduocatum habemus apud Patrem, Iesum
Christum iustum: and ipse est propitiatio pro peccatis nostris. We have an
Advocate with the father, which is Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the
propitiatory sacrifice for our sins. He says not, he was (say you) but he
is. I think the Divines of your own sort: was and shall have no place in God.
do lament to see you take hold of so slender a stay as this, to keep you
from falling. For what Divine knows not: that was, and shall, have no place
in Gods doings, when men will speak properly of him and his doings? God in
himself is always that, which with us, and in our manner of speech, he is
said to have been, or shall be. It would have done well, if you could have
cyted but one writer, either ancient or new: that understands this place as
you do. But because there is none to be cyted: you slip it over, with, so by
this. etc. But that the reader may see how worthy of credit you be: I will let
him see the judgment of the ancient Grecians, gathered by one that you have
in these Sermons cyted for your purpose more then once. Oecumenius upon this
place says thus. Aduocatmm vero dicit eum: qui Patrem pro nobis precatur sieve
flectit. Humano autem modo, and dispensatione quadam haec dicta sunt:
quemadmodum and illud, Filius nihil potest facere a se ipso. Haec enim dicit:
ne Deo aduersari videatur. Nam quod etiam filius haberet potestatem remittendi
peccata: ostenderat in Paralytico. Sed and discipulis dando vt peccata
dimitterent: John. 5. Math. 9. John. 20.
ostendit, quod sua potestate hoc tribueret. Verum, vt diximus, aut
dispensatorie hoc dicit nunc Apostolus: aut ostendens eandem filij cum patre
naturam, eandemque potentiam. Et quod quicquid faceret vna trium sanctarum
personarum: commune esset and reliquis. He calls him an Advocate: which does
entreat the father for us, Christ called an Advocate by dispensation.
or cause him to relent. But these words are spoken after the manner of men,
and by a certain dispensation: even as is this. The son can do nothing of
himself: These words he speaks: least he should seem to be against God. For
he had already showed in the man that was sick of a palsy: that the son
also, had power to forgive sins. Also in gyuing his Disciples power to
forgive sins: he showed that he did by his own power grant that. But as I
have said, the Apostle does speak this now, either by dispensation: or else
to show that the nature and power of the son, is all one and the same with
the father. And that whatsoever thing one of the three holy persons should do:
the same should be common to the rest.

By this we may see: that you have wrested the plain scriptures, to prove the
three fold offering of Christ, beside the oblation of himself in his supper,
which is the point that you go about to declare. We deny not that Christ is our
advocate, and sacrifice propitiatory for our sins: but we confess, that he
is, has been, and shall be so for ever, The act of mediation once done.
extending the virtue and force of his death and bloudshedding, to all the
faithful that either have been, or shall be, between the first man and the
last. But the action of oblation, is but one and once done upon the cross,
when he said Consummatum est. It is finished.

As for the three ways that you say Christ is offered by man: are not worth
the weighing. Figuratively (you say) Christ is offered in the oblation of the
old Testament. Here, was, would have served better then, is. And yet he was
not then offered: as I have showed in that which I have answered to the
second way of Christ's offering himself.

In your Mass, you say, you offer him mystically. I might conclude, that
therefore you do not offer him, really and corporally: and so set you against
your self. For you have said oftentimes in these your two sermons: that you
receive and offer christ in your Mass, really, corporally, and naturally. But
you will understand by mystically, as you do by sacramentally: and say that
mystically, is verily, and really. For you have learned of Gracians gloss to
say: Statuimus: id est. Abrogamus. We decree, Distinction, Mystical can not be
real. etc.
that is, we do abrogate: you may give to words what signification you lust.
But such as be learned in the tongues, do know that mystical, can not
signify, real, natural and corporal.

A number of things (you say) are done in your Mass. That is to say, Christ is
by his omnipotent power presented to you: and of you, to his and your father.
His passion is renewed: and the remission that was purchased and deserved
thereby, humbly prayed for to God, that the same may be applied unto you by
Christ. etc. Because all this is but your bare assertion without proof, either
by authority or reason: It shall suffice that I answer as saint Hierome does
in like case. Hiero. in Mat. 23.
Hoc quia de scripturis. etc Because this thing has none authority of the
scripture: it is as easily contemned as allowed.

But here I must tell you, that in one point, you descent from many of your
sort: which say that the massing priest does by his mass apply the passion of
Christ to them that he says Mass for. And you do but join it with your faith
and devotion in making humble prayer to God, that it would please him to apply
to you the remission that Christ has deserved by his passion.

1. Peter. 2.
To prove the third way that men offer Christ, which is (say you) by the
meditation of the mind. etc. You allege the saying of Peter. Sacerdotium
Sanctum. etc. How well these words of Peter do serve to prove your offering of
Christ only by meditation of mind: shall easily appear to such as will read
the rest of that Chapter. Spiritual sacrifices.
They shall find that the spiritual sacrifices that Peter speaks of there:
are a godly and honest life, full of good works, and not such idle meditations
as you ymagine.

Now, seeing that you have divided the offering up of Christ into so many
members, and have proved but one: shall it not be a good argument to inculcate
one and reject the rest? This is the peculiar manner of ye Papists, the
professed enemies of Christ, even as they do in teaching the real and
corporal eating of Christ's body in the sacrament: so in this matter of the
sacrificeing and offering of Christ, to imagine a multitude of members, where
in deed there is but one. And by such subtle shifts: they do seduce the
unlearned. But when they be espied and detected: they appear (as these of
yours do) even as they be: deuilish and pernicious Sophistry.

WATSON.
Furthermore, if any man as yet does stand in doubt whether men lawfully offer
Christ to the father or no: Division. 28
let him call to remembrance what I have said before out of Dionisius
Areopagita, Dionisius Areopa. speculat. cap. 3.
where the Bishop (as he says) does excuse himself that he offers the host
of our salvation, alleging that Christ did so command to be done, saying, do
this in my remembrance.

Let him also remember the saying of the counsel at Nece. Concilium Nicenum.
That the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world, is offered of
the Priests, not after a bloody manner.

Saint Augustine says. Per hoc sacrificium (in sorma serui) and sacerdos est,
ipse offerens, ipse and oblatio, cuius rei sacramentum, August. de ciuit libro.
10. Capit. 20.
quotidianum esse voluit ecclesiae sacrificium, cum ipsius corporis ipse sic
caput, and ipsius capitis ipsa sit corpus, tam ipsa per ipsum quam ipse per
ipsam suetus offerri. By this sacrifice (in the form of a servant) Christ is
a priest, being himself both the offerer and the oblation, of which oblation
he would the daily sacrifice of the Church should be a sacrament, and seeing
he is the head of that body, and the Church is the body of that head, as well
the Church by Christ, as Christ by the Church is accustomed to be offered.

A notable place resolving diverse doubts, declaring that the daily sacrifice
of the Church which is the Mass, is a sacrament of Christ's passion
representing the same, and further that Christ offering himself upon the
Cross, did also in himself offer his mystical body the Church, and thirdly
that the church Christ's body does not only once or twice, but is accustomed to
offer Christ her head to God in her daily sacrifice.

Hear yet a place of Saint Augustine as plain as this. Heberi in victimis
pecorum prophetiam celebrabant futurae victimae quam Christus obtulit vnde iam
Christiani peracti eiusdem sacrificij, August. contra. Faustum lib. 20. cap. 18.
memoriam celebrant, sacro sancta oblatione and perticipatione corporis and
sanguinis Christi. The Jews in their sacrifices of beasts, did celebrate the
prophecy of the sacrifice to come which Christ offered. The Christen men now
do celebrate the memory of the same sacrifice of Christ that is past by the
most holy oblation and perticipation of Christ's body and blood.

Mark how that he says christen men celebrate the memory of Christ's
passion, wherewithal? even by the offering of the same body that suffered
passion. I need say no more for this point, that men do and did use from the
beginning, to offer Christ to the father.

CROWLEY. August. de Ciuitate Dei. Lib. 10 cap. 20.
The words that you cite out of Dionisius, and the Council at Nice: are
sufficiently answered in the places where you alleged them. Concerning the
place that you cite out of Austen: you know how much those books De Ciuitate
Dei, have been corrupted, and what great travail and pains Lodouicus Viues
took in conferring of diverse copies, that thereby he might (as much as it was
possible) set forth the work of Austen in such sort as he wrote it. Upon these
words Cum ipsius corporis, ipse sit caput: he notes, that in the books that
he found in Colene and Bruges, it is written thus. Quae cum ipsius capitis
corpus sit: se ipsam per ipsum dicit offerre. Which Church being the body of
that head: says that she does through him offer up her self. And in another
Copy also, he found it even so: saving yt in the place of dicit, it was
written discit, so that the sentence is thus. Which Church being the body of
that head: Watson will follow the most unlikely
does learn by him to offer up her self. Whatsoever you think of this
diversity of readings: I think that all the learned and wise that be
trauayled in Austens works, will think either of these readings, to be more
like to be Austens, then that which you follow. And then has Austen said thus.
By this (being in the form of a servant) he is a priest, he himself
offering, and being the oblation. The sacrament whereof, he would have the
daily sacrifice of the Church to be. Which being the body of that head: does
say that she offers up her self through him. Or learneth by him to offer up
her self.

Now, what do these words of Austen make for your purpose? That is to prove
that the Mass is ye sacrifice of the Church, and that Christ is offered
therein. That Christ offered himself no man doubts: and so he was both
Priest and sacrifice. And that the Church has learned of him to offer her
self. Or says, that she does through him offer her self: no man will deny.
And that this daily sacrifice of the Church, wherein she offers her self, is
a sacrament of Christ's offering of himself: every man will grant. For as
Christ offered himself: so does the Church offer her self, being both priest
and sacrifice.

Here is your notable place, that resolves so many doubts. It were best for
you, first to be out of doubt of the reading: and to be sure, that this which
you follow is not against that which the same Austen writes in other places of
his works, August. lib. 3. de Trinitate.
and against the holy scriptures. For in such case Austen desires no credit.

The other matter that you allege out of Austen, may easily be granted, and
yet your conclusion never the latter denied. August. cont. Faust. Li. 20.
Capit. 18. August. ad Bonif. Epi. 23. Chrysostom. ad Heb. homi. 17.
For who will not confess that Christians do celebrate the remembrance of
Christ's sacrifice: when they be partakers of the holy Communion of his body
and blood? And who will deny, that the fathers used to call that holy
sacrament by the name of sacrifice or oblation, because it is the sacrament and
remembrance of that sacrifice that Christ offered once for all. I need not
therefore to say any more of this point. For it is manifest: that men neither
do, did, nor could at any time, offer Christ to his father. He only was found
worthy to offer a sacrifice to take away sin. And because no man can offer a
greater sacrifice then himself: our savior Christ has offered himself once
for all, and remains a Priest for ever. So that his one sacrifice endures
for ever: being in it self infinite, and shall never be consumed. But as saint
Augustine says. Tibi hodie Christus est, De verbis domini secund. Lucam. ser.
28.
tibi quotidie resurgit. Thou have Christ this day: he arises for thee every
day.

They say the sacrifice of the Mass diminishes and takes away the glory of
Christ, they say so, but prove it not. WATSON Division. 29


But in very deed, nothing does more set forth the glory of Christ, and his
true honor. The honor of God is considered two ways, inwardly by faith,
outwardly by extertall adoration. Latria which in English signifies the honor
that is due only to God, and to no creature, is the work of faith, and
sacrifice is a kind (Latria) of godly honor as saint Austen says: Ad hunc
cultum latriae pertinet oblatio sacrificij. August. contra. Faustum. lib. 20.
cap. 21.
etc. To this godly honor called Latria, the oblation of sacrifice does
pertayne, and for that cause it is called Idolatry if any sacrifice be done to
Idols, and therefore we do sacrifice neither to martyr nor yet to an angel,
but only to God.

Faith ought to be unfeigned and lively and then it is true honor. For he that
erreth in faith, or fayneth to have faith, does not exhibit honor and
reverence due to God.

Again, he that has true faith, but yet dead for lack of charity, he gives
reverence to god, but not perfect, and therefore not pleasant to God, because
he honors god with his understanding but not with his affection.

He that has true and lively faith, honoreth and worshippeth God in spirit
and truth.

The external and outward honor proceeds from the inward honor, and is
the protestation, practice and use of it, the work of faith outwardlye
declared. And whereas sacrifice is the special and chiefest adoration that can
be, therefore this sacrifice of Christ's own body and blood in the Mass
being institute of Christ by his own express commandment (as I have showed
already) does not only not diminishe the glory of God, but is the very
highest honor of God that man can give.

They say it is a derogation of the passion of Christ, but it is not so good
people, for the sacrifice of the Mass does ascribe altogether to Christ, for
it is the passion of Christ.

Understand well what I say and judge not till ye hear what I mean.

Cypri. lib. 2. Epist. 3.
Saint Cyprian says. Passio domini sacrificium est quod offerimus. That
sacrifice: which we offer is the passion of Christ. A strange saying, but yet
saint Augustine declares more plainly what is meant by it, in these words.
August. lib. sententiarum prosperi.
Vocatur ipsa immolatio carnis quae sacerdotis manibus fit, Christi passio mors
crucifixio, non rei veritate, sed significante, mysterio. The oblation of
Christ's flesh which is made in the hands of the priest, is called Christ's
passion, death and crucifying, not by the truth of the thing, but by the
mystery signifying. As though he should say it is called Christ's passion, not
for that Christ in very deed suffers passion again, but for that in
mysterye, it renueth, represents, and signifies his passion again.

For while that we have no worthy thing of our selves nor in our selves to
render to God for all his benefits, and as the Psalm says: Psalm. 115.
Quid retribuam Domino pro omnibus quae retribuit mihi. What shall I give to
God again, for all that he has given to me? We may do even as the Psalm
does answer. Calicem salutaris accipiam and nomen domini inuocabo. I shall
take the cup of our savior and call upon the name of our Lord. I shall take his
passion representing to God the father the work of our redemption, that we
thereby being partakers of his bloody sacrifice once made upon the cross, and
now by this our commemoration renewed again may be replenished with the fruit
of his passion and death. For saint Augustine says: Ex ipsis reliquijs
cogitationis, id est, August. in Psalm. 75.
ex ipsa memoria quotidie sic nobis immolatur, quasi quotidie nos mouet, qui
prima sua gratia nos innouauit. Of the leauings of our cogitation, that is to
say, of this very memory and commemoration, Christ is so daily offered of us,
as he does make us new men daily, which by his first grace (in baptism) did
once make us new.

See how we offer Christ daily in commemoration and what benefit of innovation
we receive thereby.

Chrysostom also says: Chrisost. in Math. hom. 7.
Non aquam de hoc nobis sonte largitur, sed sanguinem viuum qui quanque ad
mortis dominicae testimonium sumitur nobis tamen causa sit vitae. Christ out of
this fountain (of the Chalice) gives unto us not water, but lively blood,
which although it be received for the testimony of Christ's death, yet to us
it is made a cause of life.

Is not this to have fruit of Christ's passion applied unto us, when we
receive life by receiving of that which is offered in commemoration of Christ's
death.

Saint Gregory says. Quoties ei hostiam suae passionis offerrimus, Gregorius
homil. 37.
toties nobis ad absolutionem nostram passionem illius reparamus. As often as
we offer to him the host of sacrifice of his passion, so often we renew and
repair his passion to us for our absolution and perfection. Gregor. li. 1.
Dialog. lib 4. Capit. 58.
And in another place he says. Haec victima singulariter ab aeterno interitu
animam saluat, quae illam nobis mortem vnigeniti per mysterium reparat. This
sacrifice does singularlye save the soul from eternal destruction, which by
mystery renueth unto us the death of Gods only begotten son. By these
authorities ye see, that the sacrifice of the Mass does nothing derogate from
the passion of Christ but most of all does exalt it, repayring and renewing it
for us in the sight of the father, that we thereby may be renewed in grace, and
receive life, perfection, and salvation.

CROWLEY. The Mass does diminishe Christ's glory.
You say, that we prove not that the Mass does diminishe the glory of the
passion of Christ. You shall have a short and a plain proof: and leisure
enough to disprove it. Christ's glory is to have conquered death, hell, and
damnation, alone in his own person, as it was prophesied by the Prophets.
Torcular calcaui solus, Esaias. 63.
and de Gentibus non est quisquam mecum. I alone have trodden the wine press:
and there is not one of the people with me. And another Prophet says.
Perdidisti te, Israel: tantummodo in me auxilium tuum. Osea. 13.
Thou have cast away thy self, O Israel: in me alone is thy help. And again
the same Prophet says. Ero Mors tua, O Mors, morsus tuus, inferne. O death, I
will be thy death: O hell, I will be thy sting. But the sacrifice of the Mass
will not suffer that. Ergo, etc.

A proof of that which Watson says is not proved
But least you should pick a quarrel to the form of mine argument: I will
frame it in figure and mood. Whatsoever is thought to be an help to Christ,
in the conquering of death, hell, and damnation, does diminishe the glory of
Christ. But the sacrifice of the Mass is thought to be an help. etc. Ergo,
the sacrifice of the Mass does diminish the glory of Christ. The mayor
proposition is proved by the scriptures above mentioned. The minor is proved by
your own doctrine, in the beginning, middle, and end of both these sermons of
yours. Ergo, the conclusion must necessarily follow.

Now that I have proved that which (you say) was not before proved: let us see
whether we can disprove your two assertions. First you say, that nothing does
more set forth the glory of Christ and his true honor: than does the Mass. If
you can not disprove that argument that I have made for the proof of that
which we have said: then is this that you have said, sufficiently disproued
by that argument. But you have found saint Austen to be of your mind, when he
says. Ad hunc cultum etc. Contra. Faustum. lib. 20. cap. 21.
To this godly honor. etc. In the matter that follows in the same Chapter,
saint Austen does make his own meaning more plain then it can appear by
these only words that you cite. He says thus. Sacrificium laudis
glorificabit me, and illic via est, vbi ostendam illi salutare meum. Huius
sacrificij caro and sanguis, ante aduentum Christi, per victimas similitudinum
promittebatur: in passione Christi per ipsam veritatem reddebatur, post
ascensum Christi, per sacramentum memoriae celebratur. The sacrifice of praise
shall glorify me: and there is the way where I will show my saving health
unto him. The flesh and blood of this sacrifice, was before the coming of
Christ, Saint Austens mind in plain words.
promised by sacrifices of similitudes. In the passion of Christ: it was
performed by the truth thereof in deed. And after the ascension of Christ it
is celebrated by a sacrament of remembrance. And again he says. Non ergo
illi Patres nostri, etc. Those our fathers therefore, did not only leave the
images of the heathen, but they neither offering any thing to the earth, nor to
any earthlye thing, neither to the sea, neither to the heaven: did offer
sacrifices to one God, the creator of all things, even such as he would should
be offered unto him. Promising by the similitude of those sacrifices: that
sacrifice, by which through the forgiveness of sins, he has reconciled us
to himself, in Christ Jesus our Lord. To the faithful that are made the body
of that head, does Paul speak saying, I beseech you brethren, even for the
mercy of God, make your bodies, a living, holy, and acceptable sacrifice.

These words well weighed together with those that you have alleged: will make
Saint Austens mind be known to differ far from yours. It is not your
masking mumming Mass, that he calls the sacrament of remembrance, Not the
masking Mass, but the holy communion.
whereby the sacrifice of praise is celebrated among the christians: but it is
the holy communion of Christ's body and blood. This he calls the outward
work of faith, to this he joins the consecrating and dedicating of the hole
man to the service of God: which he calls (as saint Paul does) the living,
holy, and acceptable sacrifice. Your Mass therefore, not being the institution
of Christ (as I have already declared), nor yet having any ground in the
commandment or word of God: does not only diminishe the glory of Christ,
but is the greatest dishonor that man can do to God.

Your other assertion is, that the Mass does ascribe altogether to Christ:
Cypri. lib. 2. Epist. 3.
and therefore is no derogation of the passion of Christ at all. And this you
prove first by the words of Cyprian where he says. Passio Domini. etc. I will
let the reader see the hole sentence that Cyprian writes in that place: for
this that you cite, is but a Parenthesis that may be left out, and yet the
sentence remain perfect. His words be these. Et quia passionis eius mentionem,
in sacrificijs omnibus facimus (Passio est enim Domini sacrificium quod
offerimus) nihil aliud quam quod ille fecit facere debemus. And because we do
in all our sacrifices, make mention of his passion (for ye sacrifice that we
offer is his passion) we ought to do no other thing then he himself did. Now
let the reader take this sentence hole together: and judge whether Cyprian do
speak here of your Mass, or of our communion. If you will have him to speak
of your Mass: you must reform your Canon. You must blot out al your
crossings, and the rest of your Rubricks: for Christ did use none of al those
things. Neither had he disguised and hallowed apparel, holy cup, holy cloth,
nor holy altar. Cyprian speaks not of ye Mass.
It is plain therefore, that Cyprian means not of your Mass, but of our
communion: which he calls the passion of Christ, because it is celebrated in
the remembrance thereof: As I have in the former part of this answer often
proved it to be the manner of the fathers: to call the sacraments by the names of
those things that they signify. Now the reader does (I doubt not) understand
what you have said: and will judge uprightly.

Well, you make this saying of Cyprian a strange saying: and yet saint Austen
does declare the matter more plainly in these words. Vocatur ipsa immolatio.
etc. In the ninth division of your former sermon: you allege matter out of the
same Austen that this is cyted out of. And in mine answer in that place: I
have showed that it was not Austen the Bishop of Hippo, but some Austen of
Gratians making.

But let us see what Gratian has said. De Consecratio. Distinct. 2.
Sicut ergo caelestis panis qui Christi caro est, suo modo vocatur Corpus
Christi: cum reuera sit sacramentum corporis Christi, illius videlicet, quod
visibile, quod palpabile, mortale in cruce positum est vocaturque ipsa
immolatio carnis, quae sacerdotis manibus fit: Christi passio, mors,
crucifixio, non rei veritate, sed significante mysterio. Sic sacramentum fidei,
quod Baptismus intelligitur, fides est. Therefore, even as the heavenly bread,
which is the flesh of Christ, is after his sort called the body of Christ:
where as it is in deed the sacrament of Christ's body, that is, of that body
which being visible, palpable, and mortal, was set upon the cross. That
offering also that is made by the hands of the priest, is called Christ's
passion, his death, and his crucifying: not according to the truth of the
thing, but according to the signifying mystery. So the sacrament of faith which
is understand to be baptism, is faith.

You make a gloss upon the words of Gratian, Watsons gloss disproued by the
common gloss.
but not agreeing with that gloss that is published in print with the text.
That gloss says. Non rei veritate, sed significante mysterio, vt sit sensus:
vocatur Christi corpus, id est, significatur. Not according to the truth of the
thing, but after the mystery that signifies, that the meaning might be thus:
It is called the body of Christ, that is, the body of Christ is signified
thereby. I am sorry that your luck is no better: but still to allege matter
against your self.

But now I trow you have found a piece of a Psalm that will pay home. Quid
retribuam Domino. etc. Psalm. 115.
What shall I render unto the Lord. etc. You have found a marvelous mystery
in this piece of this Psalm: such as neither Austen, nor Hierome, nor any
other that has written upon that Psalm, could find. They al agree, that
this cup of salvation, is that cup of sorrow and sufferaunce, The cup of
salvation is tribulation.
that our savior speaks of when he says: Potestis, bibere Calicem quem ego
bibiturus sum? Can ye drink that cup that I must drink of? But you have found
that he meant of the Chalice that the priest says Mass withal. Bylike, you
would with better will sup of that cup twice: then once to syp of the other.

Psalm. 75.
But upon another Psalm, the same saint Austen has said. Ex ipsis reliquijs
cogitationis. etc. Of the leauings of our cogitation: that is to say, of this
very memory, and commemoration. etc. A man would think that standing before
your Prince in so solemn assemble: you would have been well ware that the
matter that you alleged out of the ancient writers, had been applied
according to their meaning. But you shame not oftentimes, to apply their words
clean contrary to that they meant: Watsons impudency.
as you do in this place the words of Austen, whereof I will make the reader
judge by letting him see the hole sentence, whereof you cite but one part for
your purpose. Austen has written thus. Cum autem non obliuiscimur munus
saluatoris: nonne quitidie nobis Christus immolatur? Et semel pro nobis
Christus immolatus est. Cum credidimus, tunc nobis fuit cogitatio: modo autem
reliquiae cogitationis sunt, qua meminimus quis ad nos venerit, and quid nobis
donauerit. Ex ipsis reliquijs cogitationis, id est, ex ipsa memoria, quotidie
nobis sic immolatur, quasi quotidie nos innouet, qui prima gratia sua nos
innouauit. etc. And when we do not forget the gift of our savior: is not
Christ daily offered for us? And Christ was once offered for us when we
believed, then had we a cogitation: and now we have remnaunts of that
cogitation, whereby we do remember who it was that came unto us, and what he
gave us. By these remnaunts of the cogitation, that is by the very
remembrance, he that with his first grace did renew us: is daily offered for
us in such sort, as though he did daily renew us: The Lord has already
renewed us in baptism, and we are become new men, rejoicing in hope, that we
may be pacient in trouble: yet ought it not to depart out of our memory, what
was done for us. etc. Here is not one word of that commemoration, that you
would have all men think that saint Austen meant of, when he said. Ex ipsa
memoria. Of the very memory: which commemoration, you understand to be your
blessed Mass. Watson blinded with affection.
But who so is not blinded with affection (as you show your self to be) and
reads the hole circumstaunce of the matter: must needs confess that saint
Austen in this place speaks neither of your Mass, nor of our Communion, but
all together of the keeping in mind and confessing of that which we were by
nature, and not forgetting of that which we be made through Christ.

Chrysostom speaks of the Lords cup and says. Chrysostom in Math. Homil. 7.
Non aquam de hoc nobis font. etc. Christ out of this Fountain. etc. The
reader shall see somewhat more of Chrysostomes alegorie. From this table (says
Chrysostom, speaking of the communion table) there springs a Fountain of
spiritual commodities, and thou leaving this table, do forthwith run to
the water, and do behold women swymming, and the very mark of their sex
set out to the eyes of all that be present: that thou may behold this thing
(I say) thou leauest Christ sitting by the Fountain of heavenly gifts. For
even now also, he does sit upon the Fountain: not speaking to one Samaritish
woman, but to the hole City. For even now also, there is none that attends
upon him: saving that some be present with their bodies, but without doubt,
some other, not so much as with their bodies. Yet for all that he departs
not: but he taryeth still, and requires drink of us, not water, but
sanctimonie, or holiness of life. For Christ does give holy things to them
that be holy. He does not give us water out of this Fountain, but living
blood: which though it be received to testify the Lords death, yet it is made
unto us, a cause of life. But thou do leave the Fountain of this blood, and
the cup that is to be had in reverence: and with speed thou renuest to that
deuillish Fountain, that thou may see an Harlot swim, and suffer shipwreck
of thine own soul. etc. Thus far Chrysostom.

You should prove that the Mass is no derogation to the passion of Christ: but
you have concluded that we receive life, by receiving of that which is offered
in the Mass. If this be no derogation to Christ's passion: then is there no
derogation of it at all, in any thing that can be done. For what other thing is
the fruit of Christ's death, but our everlasting life? You had forgotten your
self bylike, when you alleged this place: for if Chrysostom meant so grossly
as you understand him, he did set up the Mass as much to the derogation of
Christ's passion, as possibly he could. Watson would not see Chrisostomes
meaning.
But Chrysostom had another meaning: then you would see when you read his
words. He teaches the christians of Antioche: that those holy things that
Christ gives to them that be holy, are made unto them isntrumental causes of
everlasting life, yea, even that mystical blood that is received to be a
testimony of the death of him that is Lord of life. This meaning might you
have seen in the words of Chrysostom, if affection had not blinded you.

But I marvel where you found in Chrysostomes words, offered in
commemoration: for even in the Latin text that you your self cite, it is
Sumitur, is received. But you might at that time, say what you would: to the
advancement of that Idol of Rome, and all Romish Idolatry.

To those two places of Gregory that you allege: I must answer as I have
learned of saint Hierome. Hiero. in Math. 23.
Hoc quia de scripturis. etc. Because this thing has none authority of the
scripture: it is as easily contemned, as allowed. And least you should think,
that not being able otherwise to answer, I do reject the authority of so
ancient and godly a father: I will show you the reasons that move me to
think, yt these works that are extant under the name of Gregorius Magnus,
were never of his writing.

Gregory's books burned.
First, Sabinianus that succeeded him next in the Papacy: caused all his books
to be burned. And it is not to be thought, that there were many copies in so
short time, when there was no way to increase them but by hand writing.
Another thing is: the fond fables that in those works are used, in the
probation of weighty assertions, and no proof made, either by scriptures, or
authority of such as had before his days written of those matters, Three
reasons to prove Gregory's works cou^terfaite.
but bare assertions, contrary to the scriptures and fathers that had been
before him. And last of all, the strange manner of finding out the copy of his
morral exposition of the history of Job: which is to ridiculous to have any
credit with such as have any knowledge in christian religion, and have seen
the hystories that make report of the lives and doings of those that had been
Bishops of Rome, before the time of the finding out of that book.

These authorities therefore do not prove, that the Mass is no derogation to
the passion of Christ: but rather the contrary. For if all these authorities
that you have alleged, were as good as you make them, and were so meant by the
authors, as you have applied them: what other thing should they teach but yt
the Mass is a derogation to the passion of Christ? For what greater derogation
can there be to Christ's passion: then to make it a matter of so small power,
that it could not of it self be effectual to any, unless it be applied by
the mediation of some sacrificeing priest? And that it must needs be
effectual to such as it shall by such mediation be applied unto, either in
this life or after.

We have learned, both by the scriptures and ancient fathers, that the
passion of Christ is of effect to take away the sins of the whole world: The
way to apply Christ's passion.
and that it does take away the sins of all that repent and believe the
Gospel. And that there is none other way to apply the passion of Christ to
any, but only the faith of those to whom it is applied.

Furthermore they say we make our own works (meaning the Mass) a savior
beside Christ, WATSON Division. 30
which is nothing so, but by this sacrifice of the Mass, we declare, that we
believe there is no savior but only Christ.

For what do we in the Mass? We confess our sins, our unworthiness, our
unkindness, our manifold transgresions of his eternal law, we grant that we be
not able to satisfy for the least offense we have done, therefore we run to his
passion, which after this sort as he has ordained, we renew and represent. We
beseech our most merciful father, to look upon Christ's merits, and to pardon
our offenses, to look upon Christ's passion, and to releue our affection.

We knowledge that whatsoever we have done is imperfect and vnpure, and as it
is our work, does more offend his majesty then please him, therefore we offer
unto him his well-beloved son Jesus, in whom we know he is well pleased, most
humbly praying him to accept him, for us in whom only we trust, accompting
him all our righteousness, by whom only we conceive hope of salvation. And
therefore in the end of the canon of the Mass we say thus. Non aestimator
meriti sed veniae quaesumus largitor admit per Christum dominum nostrum. O
Lord we beseech thee to admit us into the company of thy saints, not waying
our merits, but grau^ting us pardon by Christ our Lord.

Also whatsoever thing we lack, all plagues, all misfortunes, all adversity
both ghostly and temporal, we require to be released of them, not through our
worthiness, but for the merits of Christ's passion.

Consider all this good people, and see whether in this doing we make our
works a new savior beside Christ or no? We believe also that our prayer is
of more efficacye and strength in the presence of Christ in the time of the
sacrifice, then at any other time. For so says saint Cyprian. Cyprian de coena.
In huius corporis presentia non superuacue mendicant lachrimae veniam, nec
vnquam patitur contriti cordis holocaustum repulsam. In the presence of this
body, the tears of a man does not beg forgiveness in vain, nor the
sacrifice of a contrite heart does never suffer repulse. And as Chrysostom
says. In illa hora dum mors illa perficitur, Chrysostom. in Act. hom. 3.
and horrendu^ sacrificium, quasi sodente rege, quaecu^que volueris perficies.
In that hour whiles that christ's death is celebrate and his fearful
sacrifice even as the king were sitting upon his mercy seat whatsoever thou will thou shall bring to pass. Chrysostom. ad Philip. hom. 3.
Stante siquidem vniuerso populo, manus in coelum extendente, caetu item
sacerdotali, verendoque posito sacrifitio, quomodo deum non placaremus pro
istis orantes? For when all the people stands holding up their hands to
heaven, and the company of the priests likewise, and the fearful and
honorable sacrifice is upon the aultare, how shall not we mittigate God
praying for them? And therefore specially then in the Mass time, we pray for
the whole Church, for all princes and high powers, for all Bishops and pastors,
for our selves our friends, and all that be present, for peace, for plenty,
for all that we have need upon, as Chrysostom writes: Chrysostom. in Act. Hom. 21
In manibus est hostia, adsunt Angelij, adsunt Arcangeli, adest filius dei, cum
tanta horrore astent omnes, astent illi clamentes omnibus silentibus, putas
temere haec fieri? ergo and alia temer and quae pro ecclesia pro sacerdotibus
offeruntur, and quae pro plenitudine acubertate absit. The host of our
sacrifice is in the priests hands, the angels be present, the archangels be
present, the son of God is present. When all men stand with such trembling,
when the angels stand crying, the other holding their peace, do thou think
these things are done in vain? Then the other also be done in vain, both that
be offered for the Church, for the priests, and also for plenty and
abundance: God forbid.

One notable place of Chrysostom I think yet expedient to rehearse unto you
concerning this matter. Chrysostom. de in com. dei natu. hom. 3.
Vt homines ramos olearum gerentes mouere reges consueuerent, eoque arboris
genere misericordiam commemorant and humanitatem: sic angeli tunc proramis
oleaginis corpus domini ipsum protendentes, rogant pro genere humano, quasi
dicant, pro his domine rogamus quos tu adeo dilexisti, vt pro little salute
mortem obires animam cruce efflares, pro his supplicamus pro quibus ipse tuum
largitus es sanguinem, pro his oramus pro quibus corpus hoc immolasti. Like as
men bearing branches of Olive trees, are wont to move kings to compassion,
and with that kind of tree do put them in remembrance of mercy and pity:
even so the angels then (in the sacrifice time) in stead of Olive branches,
holding forth the body of Christ pray for mankind, as saying thus: Lord we
pray for them whom thou have so loved, that for their salvation thou have
suffered death and spent thy life upon the cross, we make supplication for
them for whom thou have given thy blood, for them we pray for whom thou have
offered this same very body.

Now considering this fellowship with angels, this humility of man, this
pacifying of God, this efficacy of prayer for the sacrifice sake, this
knowledging of our unworthiness, this our only trust in the passion of
Christ: can any man justly burden us that we make our works a new savior
beside Christ. Furthermore, beside praying for those things we lack, we also
by this sacrifice give thanks for our redemption, for the hope of our health
and salvation, and for all Gods gifts, not only in our words, but also in
deed? the very oblation it self is a real giving of thanks to God, as
Chrysostom says. Quod erat apud eum omnibus preciosius, vnigenitum pro nobis
filium dedit, and cum essemus inimici, Chrysostom. in Mat. ho. 26.
nec dedit solum, sed and nostram mensam fecit illum, omnia faciens ipse pro
nobis, and donando videlicet and gratiarum actores ipsa donorum suorum vbertate
faciendo. etc. That thing that was with him most precious of all, his only
son he has given for us, even when we were his enemies, and not only has
given him for us, but also has made him our table, doing himself all things
for us, both rewarding us, and also with the plenty of his gifts making us
giuers of thanks, and because man in many things is unthankful to God, he in all things takes upon him our person, and supplyeth that we ought to do, and
even by the very nature, of the sacrifice which is his body, stirs us to
continual giving of thanks for all his benefits, so that our sacrifice,
being Christ's body, is both a singular gift of God, and also is a real
giving of thanks for all his other gifts.

By this it evidently appears that nothing does more exercise our faith in
the knowledge of our selves and god, nothing does more increase our charity
and hope in the mercy of God, then the Mass. Where as (Job was wont to do for
his children) the Church of God our mother, being careful for all her children
least any of them by negligence, infirmity, or wilfulness, have offended,
daily prays and makes sacrifice for them, and by that most acceptable
sacrifie of her husbands body and blood, does mittigate almighty god, does
multiply and distributeth unity. Nothing more sets forth the benefit of
Christ, because in this sacrifice of the Mass, we protest to have all things
by Christ, redemption, remission, sanctification, and salvation, and do ask
and beg of God all goodness by Christ knowledging that we have nothing to
set against the wrath of God, but the passion of Christ, which after this
manner, by this solemn representation as Christ has instituted we daily renew,
that it might be continually celebrate by mystery that once was offered for
our ransom, that because the effect of man's redemption cease not, but is to
every one in his time applied by continual succession, so also that the
sacrifice of this redemption should never cease but be always to all men
present in grace, and always live in perpetual memory.

Two untruths you affirm with one breath. One is, that in making your Mass a
sacrifice for sin: CROWLEY. Two untruths affirmed with one breath.
you do not make a savior of your own works. And the other is: that by the
sacrifice of the Mass, you declare that you believe there is no savior but
only Christ. And going about to make the matter plain that it is no untruth
that you affirm: you make it appear more plain, that it is most false that
you have said. You say that you do renew and represent the passion of Christ,
and that you offer Christ to his father: and what is this but to make your own
doyngs a salvation to your self. Was not the work that the priests of the
old law wrought in offering sacrifice for sin, accounted the purging of
those sins that they offered them for? And why shall not your work in
offering Christ to his father: be accounted the purging of your sin, and so
consequently, your savior? And can it be true that you believe there is no
savior but only Christ: when as mistrusting the sufficiency of Christ's
work once wrought in offering up himself for the sins of the world: you
will take upon you to offer him to his father? For though you say that Christ
has ordained, that you should in such sort, renew and represent his passion:
yet you are not able to prove it. Wherefore I say, you take it upon you without
commission so to do. It is he, of whom it is said. Ipse saluum faciet populum
suum a peccatis eorum. Math. 1.
He shall save his people from their sins. Christ is not an instrument of
salvation, but salvation it self.
It is not said, he shall be an instrument of salvation: whereby other may
save themselves from their sins. If Christ had not been the priest that
offered, as well as the sacrifice that was offered: we could have had no
commodity by his sacrifice. The work of offering Christ to his father, must
needs be the work of saving Christ's people from their sins therefore: and
so consequently your work in the Mass being the offering up of Christ, must
be a work of saving of Christ's people from their sins. But your work in
the Mass is not Christ's work in offering himself: Ergo, you make another
savior besides Christ.

But least you should say that mine argument concludes not: I will form you
a Syllogismus according to the rules of Logic. Whosoever does take upon him to
work the work of salvation, does make himself a savior. But you do take
upon you to work the work of salvation: Ergo, you make your selves saviors:
The mayor proposition, is a common known truth: allowed of all men. The minor
is proved thus. Whosoever takes upon him to offer Christ to his father,
takes upon him to work the work of salvation. But you do so: Ergo, you take
upon you to work the work of salvation. And how do you then declare your
selves to believe, that there is no Savior but only Christ.

Many good things you do in your Mass. You confess your sins. etc. And
last of all, you desire to be admitted into the fellowship of all saints:
Watson hydeth ye faults of the Mass.
not by your own deserving, but by the forgiveness of your sins. All this
is well. But you speak nothing of your presumption in taking upon you to offer
sacrifice to God, for the sin both of your selves and other. Pro quibus tibi
offerrimus vel qui tibi offerunt, hoc sacrificium laudis, pro se suisque
omnibus, pro redemptione animarum suarum. etc. Remember (say you) thy
servants and thine handmaydens. etc: for whom we do offer unto thee, or
which do offer unto thee, for themselves and for all theirs this sacrifice of
praise, Devil Coniurers, as good as Massing Priests.
for the redemption of their souls. The Devil coniurers can say as much for
themselves, as you do here. They can say: what do we in our coniurations? We
fast, we pray, we confess our sins: and we do all that we do, in the name
of God, the father, the son, and the holy ghost. And yet is their doing
abominable: Acts. 19.
because they presume to do that which God never wylled man to do. And they
abuse the blessed name of God in making it a mean, to call up and bind
Devils, to do as they would have them do, as the seven sons of Sceua did
abuse the name of Jesus in their coniurations.

Although you therefore, do in many things well: yet in this one thing, of
making the sacrament a sacrifice for the redemption of the souls of Gods
people, you do so presumpteously abuse, both the sacrament of Christ and the
name of God, that your hole doing beside is made abominable, as the doing of
the Devil coniurers is. When the good people therefore, shall consider this:
they will (I doubt not) judge that you make your own work in offering Christ
to his father, a savior, and therefore another savior beside Christ.

You believe (you say) that your prayer is of more efficacy and strength in the
presence of Christ in the time of the sacrifice. etc. And here you take Cyprian
to witness, when he says: In huius corporis presentia. etc. And Chrysostom
in five several places: How good a foundation these places are to build your
faith upon: the reader shall (I trust) easily perceive. Cyprian De Caena.
What Cyprians meaning was in that sermon: may well be seen in that which I
have written in the answer to the tenth, fiftenth, and thirty two deuisions
of your former Sermon. As touching those words that you cite here: I must tell
you that you have not forgotten your old manner of adding somewhat for your
purpose. Cyprian has said: In huius presentia. In his presence (meaning the
presence of God of whom he had spoken before.) And you are so bold as to say:
In huius Corporis presentia, In the presence of this body. etc. Cyprian had
said before. It were better for a man to have a millstone fastened to his neck,
and to be cast into the deep sea: then with an unclean conscience to receive
a sop at the Lords hand. Which does even unto this day create his most true
and holy body, and does sanctify, and bless and divide it, to such as do in
godly sort receive it. And then follow the words that you allege. In his
presence, tears do not beg pardon in vain: neither does the sacrifice of a
contrite heart, at any time suffer repulse. So that Cyprians meaning is: The
meaning of Cyprian.
that ye sacrifice of a contrite heart, is always accepted in the sight of God.
And although we be always in the sight of God: yet when we come together to
communicate, according to Christ's institution, we do present our selves in
the sight of the Lord, as the Israelites did, when they came to offer
sacrifice before the Arcke of the covenant of the Lord.

That this is the meaning of Cyprian in this place: does appear by his words
that follow immediately after. Quoties te in conspectu Domini video. etc. As
often as I do see thee, sighing in the sight of the Lord: I do not doubt but
the holy ghost does breath upon thee. And when I do behold thee weeping: then
I do perceive him pardoning thy sins. If thou do defile the temple of the
holy ghost, if thou defile and make filthy Gods sanctuary that is within thee,
if thou do communicate of the cup of Deuilles, with the cup of Christ: it is a
contumely and not a religion, an injury, not a devotion. It is Idol service
and horible abomination: to be wylling to serve Baall and Christ together.
Stand back with thine Idol chapels, thou that gapest after gains, and
folowest rewards. etc. I refer it to the judgment of all indifferent
readers: whether these words may maintain your Popish Mass or not. Is not
your Mass such a money matter: that it is grown into a Proverb? No penie, no
Pater noster. Such places do you pick to maintain your Mass.

But in Chrysostom you have found other manner places. In his third Homily upon
the Acts (you say) he has these words. In illa hora. etc. In ye hour. etc. In
that hole Homily, is not one word that may be wrested to that sense: but thus
I find it written there. Chrisost. in Act. hom. 3.
Non arbitror inter sacerdotes multos esse qui saluifiant, sed multo plures qui
pereant. I do not suppose, that there be many among the priests that can be
saved: but very many more that must perish. And least any man should think
that he had spoken these words rashely: he says before. Non temere dico: sed
vt affectus sum ac sentio. I speak not this rashely: but even as I am affected
and do think. Mo priests damned than saved.
It should seem by these words: that Chrysostom did not think, that prayers
made at the Mass time should be so effectual, as you boast of. For if they
were: more priests should be saved then perish. For who should so soon be
partakers of those prayers: as they that make them?

But in the.21. Homily upon that book: Chrysostom. in Act. hom. 21.
you find other manner words. For there he says. In manibus est hostia,
adsunt Angeli. etc. The host of our sacrifice is in the priests hands, the
Angels be present. etc. And peradventure the words that you said are in the
third Homily: do follow in this place. For he says thus. Quid putas pro
martyribus offerri, quod vocantur in illa hora, licet martyrs sint? Etiam pro
martyribus magnus honor nominari Domino praesente, dum mors illa perficitur and
horrendum sacrificium, and ineffabilia sacramenta. Nam quasi sedente Rege,
quaecunque voluerit perficit, vt autem surrexerit, quaecunque dicit, frustra
dicit: ita and tunc, quandiu posita fuerint mysteria, omnibus honor maximus in
memoria haberi. What do thou think is offered for the Martyrs, in that they
are named in that hour, notwithstanding they be Martyrs? Yea, it is a great
honor for the Martyrs to be named in the presence of the Lord, whiles that
death and the horrible sacrifice, and the unspeakable sacraments are performed.
For even as when ye king sits in judgment, he finisheth whatsoever matters
he lusts, but so soon as he is risen, whatsoever he says is in vain: even
so is it then also, so long as the mysteries shall be set forth, it is the
greatest honor to every man, to be had in memory.

If these were the words that you meant of before: Shameful changing of words.
then have you shamefully changed some of them. For where find you. Quaecunque
volueris perficies? Whatsoever you will thou shall bring to pass. The words
would not otherwise serve your purpose so well: and therefore you must have
liberty to change ye third person into the second, and leave out the rest yt
should declare the writers meaning.

But what need I to trouble the reader with any more words about the meaning of
this writer: seeing Erasmus (the translatour) does in his short Epistle set
before the translation, give all wise men to understand, that the work was
never of Chrysostomes wrytings, but of some one that like an Ape went about to
counterfeit Chrysostomes doings.

To the place that you cite out of the third Homily upon the Epistle to the
Philippians: Hiero in Math. 23.
I must answer with Hierome. Hoc quia de scripturis. etc. Because this has
none authority of the scriptures: it is as easily rejected, as allowed. And
the rather to be rejected: because that in all Chrysostomes works, where he
had by the text greater occasion to utter such doctrine, there is none such
found. But in this, and certain other places, where he had none, or very
small occasion, to speak any thing of the state of the dead: he plays (or
some other in his name) the Purgatory Proctor, even as though he had been a
Purgatory Chaplayne, or soul Mass priest.

Chrisost. de incomprehens. Dei natura. homil. 3.
Fourthly, Chrysostom has said. Vt homines ramos olearum gerentes. etc. Like
as men bearing branches of Olive trees. etc. He seems to have marked but a
little the manner of Chrysostomes teaching: that understands his words in
this place, as you seem to do. He finds great fault with his Auditorie,
because they used to depart out of the Church immediately after his sermons were
ended: and did not tarry to be partakers of the holy communion of the body and
blood of Christ, and the common prayers yt were made in the ministration
thereof. And as his manner was: he labors to move their affections, and to
that end, he uses those manner of speeches that you allege. But what makes
this for your Mass? Wherein such as be present are not partakers of the
mysteries, nor yet do understand the words (much less the sentences) of the
prayers that are made?

This place may serve very well, to prove that the prayer that is made by the
Minister and the hole congregation in the time of the ministration of the holy
communion: is most effectual, and even as much as if all the Angels in heaven
did, as Chrysostom would have his hearers imagine that they do.

As for that which you allege out of the twenty sixth Homily upon Matthew:
Chrysostom in Mat ho. 26.
could have no color of proouing your purpose: were it not that you help it a
little in Englishing the Latin of that which follows those words that you
cite in Latin. Bearing your hearers and readers in hand, that Chrysostom has
said, that Christ, even by the very nature of the sacrifice, which is his
body, does stir us up to continual giving of thanks: where as Chrysostom
makes no mention at all of Christ's body in that place, The sacrament of
christ's body and blood called our table.
but of a kind of sacrifice whereby God does stir us up to continual
thanksgiving, which is the same that before he has said is made our Table.
That is the sacrament of his body and blood: wherein that son of God that
was given for us is lively represented by visible signs, and we moved thereby
to be continually thankful to God, for the life that our souls have by his
death.

By this it does evidently appear, that nothing does more exercise our faith
in the knowledge of God and our selves, nothing does more increase our
charity and hope in the mercy of God: then does the right use of the holy
Communion. And although Job in offering sacrifice for his sons, did show
himself thereby, a loving and careful father: yet can not we acknowledge that
strumpet to be our mother, that will make a sacrifice of her husbands heart
blood. For Gods wrath can not be mittigated with any such sacrifice. But we are
the children of that mother: that acknowledges her self and all her Children,
to be already washed, and made pure and clean by the blood of her husband,
which he in his own person offered, to make both her and all her children
clean thereby. And there is nothing that does more set forth the benefit of
Christ: then does the right use of the sacrament of this death and blood
shedding. For in it we protest, that we have all things by Christ: and so
forth as you have said of the Mass. Which is a mere man's invention, and no
ordinance of God.

The other objections I will but shortly touch, for they be of no strength or
authority, one is this. WATSON Division. 31.
There is no mention nor no one word of any oblation in the supper, Ergo
Christ made no oblation there a goodly reason. So there is no mention made
neither of Christ's own mouth nor of any the Evangelists concerning the
oblation of the Paschall lamb, yet we know most certainly by the old
Testament that the Paschall Lamb was never eaten, but it was offered before,
which we are sure Christ did observe literally, till the truth of that figure
were established. And also what is more sure then that Christ offered himself
upon the cross, and yet neither Christ's own words, nor any of the four
Evangelists writing the story of the passion, make any mention in plain and
express terms of oblation or offering.

Though we know it by other scripture sufficiently. But their collection is all
false, they should have concluded thus, Ergo if there any oblation, it is real
and not vocalle, and so it is in deed, Luc. 22.
and therefore Christ said: Hoc facite, do this, as ye see me do. But in
the form of our Mass, there be express words of offering, for the rude and
ignorant, and for the evidence of the truth. Vnde and memores nos domini. etc.
Wherefore we thy servants, and people being mindful of thy son Christ our
Lord, of his blessed passion, resurrection and glorious ascension, do offer
to thy most excellent majesty of thy rewards and gifts, this pure sacrifice,
this holy and undefiled sacrifice, the holy bread of everlasting life, and the
cup of perpetual salvation.

There be also other words of oblation following these words, saint Basil has
them, Chrysostom, saint Ambrose, the general counsel holden at Ephesus, the
latest of these was a thousand three hundred years ago, that it might appear
that it is not newly brought in, as they would slander it, but the most
ancient thing in all the Mass. They reason also thus. It is a commemoration,
ergo no sacrifice, as who say the paschall Lamb being the figure of this, was
not both a commemoration and a sacrifice, for the Lamb was instituted to be
offered for a memory of the delyueraunce of the Jews from the sword of the
Angel that smote the first begotten of the Egiptians, and therefore the Jews
kept this word of offering the Lamb, for a statute for them and their
children for evermore. Even so this Lamb of God that lies upon the table of
our altar is a sacrifice offered of us in commemoration of our delyueraunce
from the Devil by the death of Christ. In the old Testament the first Lamb
offered before their delivery, and the Lamb which was offered every year
after in memory of the same delivery, were very real Lambs in deed of one
nature and condition: even so the Lamb of God being Christ, which Christ
himself offered in his supper, there instituting before his death, what we
should contynually do after his death, and that Lamb of God, which we offer
now in memory of our deliverance, be very real Lambs of God in deed, and
yet not diverse in number as the other were, but all one in number, nature,
condition and dignity.

As Chrysostom says: Chrysostom. ad Hebreos ho. 17.
we offer daily in commemoration of his death, and the sacrifice is one, not
many. Nor we do not offer one Lamb now, to morrow another, but always the
very same, or else because it is offered in many places, is there many Christ's?
No forsooth, but one Christ every where, here full Christ, and there full
christ, one body, And so forth.

You frame our argument after your own fashion: CROWLEY.
and so are you the better able to answer it. We reason thus. Whatsoever
Christ would have us do or believe: is in some part of the scripture so
mentioned, that we may plainly perceive, that it is his will that we should do
or believe the same. But there is no such mention in any part of the holy
scripture, whereby we may perceive that it is Gods will that we should believe
that Christ offered himself in his last supper, or that he did then institute
a sacrifice wherein we should daily offer him. Ergo, Christ has not instituted
any such sacrifice as you speak of.

As for the like reasons that you would make of the Paschal Lamb, and Christ
offering himself upon the Cross, might be well accepted of some of your
Auditorie that were of your mind, and therefore blinded by affection. But as
many of your readers as know the scriptures, must needs say that you might
with more honesty, have kept them still in your bosom. For who knows not,
that Christ himself has said. Non veni soluere legem, sed adimplere. Et qui
soluerit vnum ex mandatis istis minimis: minimus vocabitur in Regno coelorum. I
came not to break the law, but to fulfill it. Math. 5. John. 14. John. 8. Romans
5. Hebr. 9.
And he that shall break one of the least of these commandments: shall be
called the least in the kingdom of heaven. And again. Behold the prince of
this world comes: and in me he has nothing at all. And again. Which of you
can accuse me of sin? And again. As by the sin of one, condemnation came
upon all: so by the righteousness of one came the righteousness of life. And
again. He offered himself unto God without spot. etc.

The conclusion that you would have us make, does very well. For by that
conclusion you confess, that Christ's offering of himself in his supper was a
visible Action: and that he commanded his disciples to do as they saw him
do. Then, either he made three crosses upon the cup and bread together, The
form of the Popish Mass.
and again, three crosses upon them both together, and one cross upon the
bread, and one upon the cup, and then one upon the bread breathing out five
words upon it, and then one upon the cup, lifting up and laying down. etc. or
else the Mass that you have in the popish Church, is not that which Christ
did then institute.

You have granted now, that in Christ's institution, there is no word of
offering: but in your form of Mass (you say) you have express words of
offering. We would feign know then, where you had those words. You say that
Basil, Chrysostom, Ambrose, and the general counsel at Ephesus, had them:
and the latest of these was.1300. Diuisione. 9. Cyprian. li. 2. Epistol. 3.
years ago. But the Chronicles will pull you back an hundred years and more.
But what if all these had it: does this prove that Christ had it? In your
other sermon you could cite a rule out of Cyprian that was nighe hand.200.
years before the eldest of the four that you named now: wherein he says. In
sacrificio quod Christus est: non nisi Christus seque^dus est. In that
sacrifice which is Christ: none but Christ is to be followed. If you can not
prove therefore that Christ used those toys that you do use in your Mass: you
ought not, by Cyprians rule, to use them, though never so many have used them
before you. And if it can not be proved by scripture, that Christ made a
sacrifice of himself in his supper: you may not make a sacrifice of him in your
Mass. etc.

But it is sufficient for your purpose, that you have proved, that it is not so
newly brought in, as we would slander, but it is the most ancient thing in
the Mass. Well, grant it be so. Yet is neither that nor your Mass so
ancient as you would make it: nor so ancient that we may take it for
Christ's institution. And all these that you have named do speak of a
Communion, and not of a Mass, and do call it a sacrifice, for such cause as I
have often declared in this answer.

To our other reason you say, that it is both a commemoration and a sacrifice:
as the Paschall Lamb was. Our Argument is in this form. A commemoration of
any thing, is not that thing.
Whatsoever is the commemoration of a thing: is not, neither can be the thing
it self whereof it is a co^memoration. But the sacrament is a commemoration of
christ's sacrifice: Ergo, it is not, neither can be the sacrifice it self.
Your example therefore that you make of the Paschall Lamb: touches not our
reason. For it was not a Commemoration of it self, neither was it the thing it
self, whereof it was a Commemoration.

As for your similitude that you take of the Lambs of the old law: is not
worth a button. For it follows not, that because those Lambs were very real
Lambs in deed: therefore, as often as the sacrament of Christ's body and blood
is ministered, it must needs be the real Lamb of god in deed, and the same
that Christ himself is. I am sure all the Logique you have can not prove this
a good Argument.

That Christ offered himself in his last supper, you have not yet proved: much
less have you proved, that he did then institute any sacrifice, wherein we
should continually offer him. What Chrysostom means by offering and
sacrifice in that place that you cite does plainly appear by his own words
in the same Homily. Non aliud sacrificium sicut pontifex, Chrysostom ad
haebraeos homil. 17.
sed idipsum semper facimus: magis autem recordationem sacrificij operamur. We
do not make another sacrifice, as did the high priest, but we do always make
the very same: yea rather we do work the remembrance of a sacrifice. Thus
has Chrysostom made his own meaning so plain: that it helps your purpose
nothing at all.

WATSON. Division. 32.
The like argument they make against the real presence. It is a sign, ergo
not the thing whereof it is a sign. The foolishness of this reason every
Baker can tell, who sets one loaf upon his stall to signify there is bread
to sell within his house. Which lofe is both a sign of bread to be sold, and
also is very bread to be sold it self of the same baking the other is. Eue^ so
the body of Christ in the sacrament is Christ's very body in deed, and also a
sign of the same body, as saint Augustine says. Carne and sanguine vtroque
inuisibili, spirituali, August. li. Sent. prosp.
intelligibili, signatur visibile Domini nostri Jesus Christi corpus and
palpabile, plenum gratia omnium virtutum and diuina maiestate. By the flesh
and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ both being (in the sacrament) invisible,
spiritual, and intelligible, is signified the visible body of Christ, and
palpable, full of the grace of all virtues, and of the godly majesty. And even
so likewise very Christ is offered in the mystery in sign and commemoration
of himself offered upon the cross, as saint Augustine says. Christiani iam
paracti sacrificij memoriam celebrant sacro sancta oblatione and participatione
corporis and sanguinis Christi. August. cont. Faust. lib. 20. Capit. 18.
Christen men now do celebrate a memory of Christ's sacrifice already past
by the most holy oblation and participation of Christ's body and blood. The
like saying has saint Gregory and diverse Authors which I omit to rehearse,
Gregor. ho. 22.
because the time is past.

CROWLEY.
Every Baker can tell the foolishness of the reason that we make, when we say:
It is a sign, Ergo, not the thing whereof it is a sign (say you.) And I say,
that every Bakers boy can tell that he is but a deceytfull Sophister: that will
when he has bought the lofe that stood on the stall for a sign, say that he
has bought all the bread in the Bakehouse, whereof that lofe was a sign. If
that reason be foolish: then is not your reason wise, that will prove by that
similitude, that Christ the lamb of God, and al those Lambs of God that all
the priests of the popes Church, either have or shall offer in their Masses,
are but all one in number, nature, condition, and dignity. The Baker and his
boy.
Let the baker and his boy therefore, discuss the folly of these two reasons:
and do you consider better our reasons, when we say, that the sign is not
that thing whereof it is a sign. For the saying is saint Austens, and therefore
not to be rejected, Austust. in John. tract. 26.
unless you can disprooue it by better authority then the judgment of the
Baker. Saint Austen says. Nam and nos hodie accepimus visibilem cibum: sed
aliud est sacramentum, aliud est virtus sacramenti. For even this day, we have
received visible food: but the sacrament is one thing, and the virtue of the
sacrament is another thing. Again, the same Austen says. Omnis doctrina, vel
rerum est, vel signorum: sed res per signa discuntur. De doctrina Christ. li.
1. Capit. 1.
All doctrine is either of things, or of the signs of things: but things are
learned by signs. By this it appears that Austens judgment was not, that a
sign could be the same thing whereof it is a sign.

But what need I to trouble the reader with so many words about this matter:
so many as do know what the Art of reasoning means (even the children at the
university) can tell, that Relatiues are called (...), that is referred to
somewhat: because they be always referred to another thing then they are
themselves. As a father, is a father, in respect of that son whom he has
begotten: and can not be that son whose father he is. Even so, a sign, is
called a sign, in respect of that thing whereof it is a sign: and can not be
that self thing that is signified by it. The Baker therefore, that taught you
to say, The Baker was not pre^tise in the University.
that the lofe upon the stall, is the same bread that is to be sold, whereof
it is a sign: has not been brought up in any Bakers house in the university,
for if he had, he would never have deceived you so.

But that both Bakers and Bruers, and all other that have the use of reason,
may judge of the foolishness of our reason: I will let the Reader see it in
writing. It is thus. Whatsoever things, be such as they are called, by having
relation to other things then they be themselves: can not be those things
whereunto they have relation. But every thing that is called a sign, is so by
the relation that it has to the thing that it signifies: Ergo, no signs can
be the same things that they do signify. Whereof our conclusion follows: which
is, yt the sacrament of Christ's body and blood, being a sign thereof, can not
be the thing it self. Now ask your Baker what he can say to this reason.

The place that you allege out of Austen: is answered in the.29. August. lib.
Sent. Prosp. Contr. Faust. li. 20 cap. 18.
division of this sermon: and in the.28. division of the same sermon, is
answered the other place that you allege out of the same Austen also.

To Gregory and the reast: you shall look for answer, when you cite their
words that we may weigh them.

They say, that neither the Apostles nor none in their time did offer Christ's
body in sacrifice. WATSON Division. 33.
And yet I have showed you before, that Dionisius Areopagita saint Paul's
Disciple (of whom mention is made in the.17. chapter of the Acts of the
Apostles) did offer the sacrifice of Christ's body, alleging Christ's
commandment for his warrant.

Ireneus that lived within fifty year of saint John the Evangelist and
Policarpus Scholar does make mention of this offering saying. Ireneus. li. 4.
cap. 34.
Ecclesiae oblatio quam Dominus docuit offerri in vniuerso mundo, purum
sacrificium reputatum est apud Deum, and acceptum est ei. The oblation of the
church which our Lord taught to be offered in the whole world, is reputed of
God a pure sacrifice and acceptable to him.

And in the same chapter confuting them that denied the immortality of the
flesh, by this reason that our flesh, was nourished with Christ's flesh to
eternal life, concludes thus. Aut sententiam mutent, aut abstineant offerendo
quae praedicta sunt, either let them change their opinion, or else abstain
from offering the same body and blood of Christ we spoke of.

Also the general counsel of Constantinople says, that saint James did write
the form of a Mass, Council. Constable. in trul. cap. 32
I omit the Latin, the words in English be thus faithfully translate. Saint
James brother to Christ our God according to the flesh, to whom the church of
Jerusalem was first committed, and Basilius which was Bishop of Caesarea,
whose fame is known throughout the world, which delivered in writing the
mystical celebration of the sacrifices, have declared that the cup in our holy
ministry ought to be of water and wine mingled.

And the holy fathers that were assembled at Carthage, have thus left in
writing, that in the sacrifices nothing else be offered, but the body and blood
of our Lord, as our Lord himself has ordained and so forth. I never read
saint James his book my self, nor I think, it be not now to be had, but I
tell you so much as I know, that saint James did write the form of a Mass,
as saint Basil did (which we have in Greek now). If this great and learned
general counsel does truly report, as I believe does. Let no man therefore
believe them that say, the Apostles did not sacrifice themselves, nor none in
their time except they can prove the negative, which they shall never do.

To that which you have alleged out of Dionisius, CROWLEY.
I have answered in the last division of your former sermon, and in the.23.
division of this sermon. And the matter that you do here allege out of
Ireneus, is sufficiently answered in the fourth, the fourtenth and twenty
four divisions, of your former sermon. Wherefore I need not here to make any
further answer.

Where you find the Latin that you do so faythfullye translate into
English: I can not tell. De Consecra. Did. 1.
But I suppose it will be hard for you to find it in the counsel holden in
Trullo: as you note in the Margin. In Gratian I find it thus cyted out of the
sixth Synod. Iacobus frater Domini secundum carnem, cui primum credita est
Hierosolimitana Ecclesia, and Basilius Caesariensis Episcopus, cuius charitas
per totum orbem refulsit: in scripturis addiderunt nobis missae celebrationem.
Which is in English as you have translated: saving that for (whose love) you
say, whose fame, and add mystical, where as in the Latin there is no word
that may so signify. Change is no robbery.
And turning the Verb (have given in writing) into the Participle of the same
Verb: you add to the end, have declared that ye cup. etc.

Of this form of Mass (as you term it) and of the other that you name: I
have noted somewhat in mine answer to the ninth division of your former
sermon. And where as you say that you had not as then read it, nor did think
that it was to be had: I have read it, and have it to show. And amongst other
things I note: that he makes prayer for such as then lived in monasteries. The
forger of this piece of work did not remember how early days it was in saint
James his time: and therefore he supposed Monasteries had been builded then. It
forces not greatly what is found in those counterfaited Masses. And for my
part I will look for no credit of those that will believe that James would
pray for them that dwelt in Monasteries, so long before any Monasteries were
builded, let that great learned council report what they lust. And if I shall
say, that neither the Apostles nor any in their time did offer sacrifice to
God: then let no man credit me, except I be able to prove the negative, which
I confess I shall never be able to do. What sacrifice the Apostles did offer
to God.
For they did continually offer to God, that acceptable sacrifice that God
requires of Christians: which is their hole bodies and souls in his service.
But that they offered Christ to his father (as you imagine) that no wise man
will believe, till you be able by scripture to prove that affirmative: which
you shall never be able to do.

WATSON. Division. 34
There be other some, that will grant the sacrifice, but deny that it is
propitiatory for the sins of the quick and the dead. And therefore they
disalow the last sentence of the Mass. Where the priest says, grant good
Lord, that this sacrifice which I have offered to thy divine majesty, be
propitiable or a mean to obtain mercy, to me, and to all, for whom I have
offered it. And surely these be most foolish of all, for if it be a sacrifice
it must needs be a propitiatory sacrifice taking (propitiatory) as it ought
to be taken, not confounding the meaning of it by sophistry, but understanding
the diverse acception of the word: but these men dally, and seduce the people
with Amphibologies and doubtful sayings.

Distinctions they admit none nor can not abide to have the matter opened, and
with a confuse general saying slander the Church.

This is their private sophistry, and yet they call other men sophisters, that
detect and open their collusions, that divide the sentence, that men might see,
how it is true, and how it is false. For example. They cry out of this, that we
say, the Mass is a sacrifice propitiatory. By the word (Mass) may be
understood two things, the thing it self that is offered, and the act of the
priest in offering of it. If ye take it for the thing offered, which is the
body of Christ, who can justly deny but that the body of Christ is a
sacrifice propitiatory, seeing saint John says, he is the propitiation for our
sins, ever was and ever shall be, and never cease so to be, till our sins
be ended, Oecumenius in cap. 3. ad Romanos.
and death the last enemy be ouercomed in us his mystical body? and as
Oecumenius says: Caro Christi est propiatorium nostrarum iniquitatum. The
flesh of Christ is the propitiation for our iniquities.

But if by the word (Mass) be understood the act of the priest, and the use
of the sacrament (as they would have it) then it is not propitiatory in that
degree of propitiation as Christ's body is, but after an other sort. And
therefore I must divide the word (propitiatory) which is taken two ways also.
First for that that worthily deserves mercy at Gods hand, and so the act the
priest in offering, is not propitiatory, of it self deserving mercy, as
Christ does.

Next for that provoke God to give mercy and remission, already deserved by
Christ. And so the oblation of the priest is propitiatory, moving and
provoking God to apply his mercy unto us.

So prayer is a sacrifice for sins, as S. James says. Jacob. 5.
Oration fidei saluabit infirmum, and si in peccatis sit, remittentur ei. The
Prayer of faith shall save the sick, and if he be in sin, they shall be
remitted unto him. And christ taught us to pray thus, forgive us our trespases,
as we forgive them that trespase against us. Math. 6.7.
And also promised to give us, that we ask in Christ's name.

Then ye see, that prayer being a sacrifice is a provocation of God, and a
mean to atteyne remission of our sins, and therefore may be well called
propitiatory.

So is a contrite heart a sacrifice propitiatory and almose, as appeared by the
story of the Ninevites and of Daniell. Psalm. 50.
For all good works that we do, both fasting, prayer, almose, forgiving of my
neighbor is done for this end, to mittigate Gods anger against our sins,
and to provoke him to have mercy of us for Christ's merits.

Even so the Mass (taking it for the act of the priest) is a sacrifice
propitiatory for sin. Which I shall prove unto you by the holy fathers, Origin
writes thus. Si referantur haec ad mysterij magnitudinem, Origin. in Le. hom.
13.
inuenies commemorationem istam habere ingentem repropiationis effectum. Si
redeas ad illum panem propitiationis, quem proposuit Deus propitiationem per
fidem in sanguine eius: and si respicias ad illam commemorationem de qua dicit
dominus hoc facite in meam commemorationem, inuenies quod ista est commemoratio
sola quae propitium faciat Deum. If these be referred to the greatness of our
mystery, thou shall find that this commemoration has a great effect of
propitiation. If ye return to that bread of propritiation, which God has set
for a propitiation by faith in his blood: and if ye look to that
commemoration, of which our Lord said. Do this in commemoration of me: thou
shall find, that this is the only commemoration that makes God merciful.
Cyprian. Ser. de coena.


Does not saint Cyprian call the sacrament hol aucastum ad purgandas
iniquitates, a sacrifice to purge iniquity? in what respect is it called so,
but for that it is offered, to that end? And so is it called a medicine to
heal infirmities, for this respect that it is received to this end.

Augu. ser. 11. de sanctis.
Saint Augustine says likewise. Nemo melius praeter martyrs meruit tibi
requiescere vbi and hostia christus est and sacerdos scilicet, vt
propitiationem de oblatione hostiae consequantur. No man has deserved better
then the Martyrs, to rest (and be buried) there, where Christ is both the host
and the priest (that is to say under the aultare,) for this end that they
might attain propitiation by the oblation of the host. Mark the purpose I
bring in this for, which is to atteine propitiation by the oblation of the
sacrifice: and as he says in an other book. Sacrificium illud mirabile and
coeleste quod tu instituisti and offerri praecepisti in co^memoratione^ tuae
charitatis mortis scilicet and passionis, August. in Manuale, Cap. 11.
pro salute nostra pro quotidiana fragilitatis nostrae reparatione. That
marvelous and heavenly sacrifice, which thou have instituted and commanded to
be offered in remembrance of thy charity, that is to say, of thy death and
passion, for our health and salvation, for the daily reparation of our frail
weakness.

Does he not here show the end of the oblation, to save us, and to repair
our frayltie. Saint Hierome writes. Si laicis imperatur, vt propter orationem
abstineant ab vxoribus, Hierony. in Cap. 1. ad Titum.
quid de episcopo sentiendu^ est, qui quotidie pro suis populique peccatis
illibatas deo oblaturus est victimas. If it be commanded to the lay men, that
for prayers cause they should absteyne from their wives, what should we think
of a Bishop that must offer daily pure sacrifices for his own sins and the
peoples.

Of this place though I might prove you the chaste life of a Bishop: yet I
bring it in now only to show, that the office of a Bishop is to offer daily
pure sacrifice for his own sins and the peoples sins, as saint Basil
says in the book of his Mass.

Da domine vt pro nostris peccatis and populi ignorantij acceptum sit
sacrificium nostrum. Grant O Lord that for our sin, Basilius in Missa.
and the ignorance of the people our sacrifice may be accepted of thee.

Thus ye perceive, that I have showed you, and proved that the oblation of the
priest in the Mass is a sacrifice propitiatory for the sins of them that be
alive, that is to say, moving and provoking God to pardon the sins of the
priest and of the people.

A little is to be said, concerning them that be departed and then an end of
that matter. Tertull. eorum millit.


Tertullian says, Oblationes pro defunctis pro natalitijs annua die facimus.
We make every year oblations for the dead, and for the birth days of Martyrs,
which be the days they suffered their martyrdom.

Athanasius says. Intelligimus animas peccatorum participare aliqua
beneficentia abexangui immolatione. Athanasius ad antiochiu^ quest. 34.
We understand, that the souls of sinners, do receive some benefit of the
unbloody oblation and of almose, done for them, as he only has ordained and
commanded, that has power both of quick and dead. Our God.

Ambros. de obitis Valen.
And saint Ambrose exhorts the people to pray for the soul of Valentinian
the Emperor, for whom he did offer the sacrifice of Christ's body.
Chrysostom says.

Non frustra sancitum est ab apostolis, vt in celebratione venerandorum
mysteriorum memoria fiat eorum, Chrysostom. ho. 3. ad philippenses.
qui hinc discesserunt: noucrunt illis multum hinc emolumenti fieri. etc.

It was not in vain ordained of the Apostles, that in the celebration of the
honorable mysteries, there should memory be made of them that were departed
hence. For they knew much profit, much commodity to come to them thereby.

Chrysostom. hom. 41. in 1. Cor. 15.
And in an other Homily he says in this manner in English. A sinner is
departed surely it becomes us to be glad that his sins be stopped and not
increased, and to labor as much as we can to release him not with weping, but
with prayer, In Act. ho. 21.
supplications, almose and sacrifices. For that was not ordained in vain, nor
we do not in vain in our holy mysteries celebrate the memory of the dead, and
make intercession for them to the Lamb that lies there, which takes away the
sins of the world, but that some comfort may thereby come to them. Is not
this very plain? and that it is not a thing new invented, but a doctrine
taught and used in the Church ever since Christ, and ordained so to be done by
the Apostles themselves.

August. con. li. 4. cap. 12.
Saint Augustine says in his book of confessions, that the sacrifice of our
price, which is Christ's own natural body was offered for his mothers soul
after she was dead.

And he says also. De cura pro mortuis. ca. 1.
In Machabeorum libris legimus oblatum pro mortuis sacraficium. Sed and si
nunquam in scripturis veteribus omnino legeretur, non parua hac consuetudine
claret authoritas vbi in praecibus Sacerdotis quae Domino Deo ad eius altar
funduntur, locum suum habet etiam commendatio mortuorum, In the Books of the
Machabes we read, that there was sacrifice offered for the dead. But although in
the old scriptures there were no such thing read, yet there appears no small
authority in this custom, that amongs the prayers of the priest, which are
made to our Lord God at his altar, the commendation and prayer for the dead
has also his place.

Mark well that he says, it was an old custom, in the Church for priests in
their Mass to pray for the dead, in his time which is above.1130. year ago.
And that the custom of the Church in this point is of sufficient authority to
prove this matter, though there were no scripture for it at al, and yet he
himself alleges the book of Machabes for it, the place is known well
enough.

He teaches us the same thing writing upon saint John. August. in Joan.
Tract. 84.
Ideo ad ipsam mensam non sic cos commemoramus quemadmodum alios qui in pace
requiescunt vt etiam pro eis oremus, sed magis vt orent ipsi pro nobis vt eorum
vestigijs inhereamus. etc. talia enim suis fratribus exhibuerunt, qualia de
Domini mensa acceperunt.

Therefore at the very table (of the aultare) we do not so remember (the
martyrs) as we do other, other that rest in peace that we pray for them. But
rather that they should pray for us, that we might follow their footesteps. For
they have given such things for their brethren, as they have received from our
Lords table. Here is both prayer to saints, and for the dead in the Mass. Thus
ye see how Christ's body is offered for the dead, after what manner it avails
them.

Saint Augustine also teaches saying thus. When the sacrifices either of the
aultare, or of any almose be offered for the dead that were baptized: for the
very good men, August. Euchirid. Cap. 109.
they be gyuing of thanks, for not very evil men, they be propitiations,
for very evil men, although they be no relief of the dead, yet they be
certain comforts of them that be alive. And to them they profit, they profit
to this end, either that they should have full remission or at least that they
should have more tolerable damnation.

In this authority is expressed the plain word of propitiatory, how that the
sacrifice of the altar is a propitiation for such souls, as be not very evil
or very good toward that teyning of full remission, or of more tolerable
damnation.

If I should recite as much as I could bring in for this point at large: it is
not one or two hours that would suffice to the rehearsal of the places.

By this little I have said, ye may perceive, after what sort it is true, that
the Mass is a sacrifice propitiatory for sin, both for the quick and the
dead.

CROWLEY.
When you shall show the names and words of them that grant the Mass to be a
sacrifice, and yet deny it to be propitiatory for sins: then will I either
condemn their folly, or your false report. These men (you say) do disalow the
last sentence of your Mass. etc: so do I, with the rest that has been devised
by men, The use of Distinctions
and has no ground in Gods word. Distinctions I can well away with, when they
tend to the opening of things doubtfully spoken of in the scripture: but not
when they tend to the maintenance of man's doctrine, contrary to the word of
God. This Sophistry therefore is none of mine: wherefore, I may be bold to
call him a Sophister, that uses distinctions, to cause things that are false,
to seem true, as you do in this place use two distinctions. The Mass may be
taken for the thing offered in the Mass (which is the body of Christ) say
you: and for the act of the priest and use of the sacrament. Both the ways it
is propiciatorie: but the one way it deserves mercy, and the other way it
does but provoke God to apply his mercy. These distinctions of the Mass and
propitiation, tend not to the opening of any thing doubtfullye spoken of in the
Scriptures, but to the maintenance of a doctrine of your own, contrary to the
scriptures: wherefore I can not allow them. The scripture says, that as Moses
did lift up the serpent in the Wilderness, John. 3.
so the son of man must be lifted up: that all that believe in him should not
perish, but have everlasting life. Here is none other thing mentioned whereby
Christ's merits should be applied unto men, but only faith. And saint Austen
says thus. Holocaustum dominicae passionis, August. in Expos. incho. ad Romans
eo tempore offert vnusquisque pro peccatis suis quo erusdem passionis fide
dedicatur. Then does every man offer the sacrifice of Christ's passion for
himself: when he is dedicated in the faith of Christ's passion.

It is true therefore, that Oecumenius has said. Caro Christi est
propitiatorium nostrarum iniquitatum. In caput. 3. ad Romans
The flesh of Christ is the propitiation for our iniquities. And the only way
to apply this propitiation to us: is by believing the promise that God has
made therein. As appears by the words of saint Paul, in that place where
Oecumenius had occasion to write those words. Where saint Paul says thus.
Iustificantur autem gratis, per gratiam ipsius, per redemptionem quae est in
Christo Jesus: Romans 3.
quem proposuit Deus propitiatorem, perfidem in sanguine ipsius. And they are
freely made righteous, by his free mercy, through the redemption which is in
Christ Jesus: whom God has set to be a propitiatour, through faith in his
blood.

Your distinction therefore, that tends to a another mediation or propitiation
then this: is not to be allowed amongst them that be of Christ's school. Yea,
the Clerks of the Popes school, out of whose books you learned your Popery:
will not allow your declaration that you make upon the second parts of these
your distinctions.

Angelus says, that the Mass is available to whom so ever it please the
priest to apply it by his intention. In summa Angel. in Missam.
And that the Mass is nothing else, but the applying of the merit of Christ's
passion, yea, and that Respectu operis operati. In respect of the work wrought
by the priest in saying Mass: though you by your Sophistry would make men
believe, that Opus operatum, is that work which Christ has already wrought
upon the Cross. Biel, Holcot Dunse, and the reast of that flock, be of the
same mind: wherefore, if they were living, they would not suffer you to pass
with such a declaration of your destinction, as you make here. For you will
have the Mass (as it is the Act of the priest) to be propitiatory none
otherwise, then is the prayer of the faithful, the contrition of the penitent,
the almose of the merciful, and the forgiveness of the charitable, which is,
as you say (but not truly) to mittigate Gods anger against our sins: and to
provoke him to have mercy upon us for Christ's merits. And this you offer to
prove by the holy fathers.

Origin. in Leuit. ho. 13.
Origin has said thus (say you) Si referantur haec. etc. If these words be
referred to the greatness of our mystery. etc. Here you have thrust in the
Pronowne ours, and have said of our mystery: because you would have your
hearers and readers to think that Origin meant of your Mass, which you call the
greatest mystery of your religion. Where as in deed, he means of the
mystery of the.xij. loaves: yt were continually upon the table in the
tabernacle before the Arc of the covenant. And he calls our savior Christ,
which is the bread that came from heaven: the greatness of that mystery. But
you leave out that piece, least the writers mind should appear. Craftily you
creep away with the sentence thus. Si redeas ad illum panem propitiationis.
etc. Even as it were poynting with the finger, at your little round wafer. But
Origin has written thus. Si redeas ad illum panem, qui de coelo descendit, and
dat huic mundo vitam, illum panem propositionis. etc. If thou return to that
bread which came down from heaven, and gives life to this world, that bread
of proposition, whom God has set to be a propisiation, through faith in his
blood. etc.

Cypri. ser. De Caena.
And does not Cyprian call the Sacrament Holocaustum. etc? Of this place of
Cyprian, I have said enough to satisfy the reasonable reader, in the answer
to the fifth division of your former Sermon.

Concerning the two places that you allege out of Austen: I will trouble the
reader with nothing, more then the judgment of Erasmus, concerning the two
books that you allege them out of. Tomo. 10. Pagina. 2.
Of the first, he says thus. Quae sine controuersia sunt Augustini: primo
posuimus loco. Impudentissimum figmentum sermonum ad fratres in eremo agentes:
in suum angulum reiecimus, de quo suo loco non nihil dicemus. Insunt and
coeteris, multa parum referentia phrasim and eruditionem Augustini: quorum
aliquot notauimus. Those works which are undoubtedly Austens own: we have
placed in the first place. That most unshamefast lie, of the sermons to the
brethren that lived in wilderness: we have cast into a corner meat for them,
whereof we will in their place speak somewhat. In the rest there be many
things that do very little resemble the phrase and learning of Austen, whereof
we have noted some. And of the other book he says thus. Liber qui sequitur,
ex superioribus libellis, magna ex part sarcinaetus est, per quempiam, nec
eruditione, Tomo. 9. in front illius Libr.
nec eloquentia preditum: proinde, non video, cur admodum lectu dignus
videatur. Capite. 17. ponit in potestate hominis, vt promereatur Regnum
coelorum: quam sententiam vbique detestatur Augustinus. Quanquam idem. Capite.
22. dicit diuersum. The book that follows is for the most part patched
together out of the little books that go before, by some man that had neither
learning nor eloquence: wherefore, I do not see why it should seem very
worthy to be read. In the.17. Chap. he does put it in the power of man, to
deserve the kingdom of heaven. Which sentence, Austen does in all places
detest. And yet the same writer does in the.22. Chapter, say the contrary. Such
forged matter is meet for the proof of the propiciation of your Mass, for
the sins both of the quick and the dead.

You have mistaken the place that you allege out of Hierome. For upon the
first Chapter to Titus: Hiero. in Cap. 1. ad Titum.
he writes not one word that may be wrested to such a meaning, as those
words have that you cite. But he has words there to the contrary of that,
whereof (you say) you might prove the chaste life of a bishop.

Of what authority the Mass of Basil is, Basilius in Missa.
I have noted in mine answer to the ninth division of your former sermon, and
need not now to trouble the reader any more with that matter. and thus we can
not see by that light that you have hitherto given us: that the Mass is a
sacrifice propiciatorie, for the sins of them that be alive.

Now a little you have to say, concerning them that be departed: and then an
end of that matter. Tertulian says (say you) Oblationes pro defunctis. etc.
We make every year oblations for the dead. De corona Militis.
etc. I will set down in writing the sentence that goes before, and that
which follows immediately after: that the indifferent Reader may weigh
altogether, and judge of the writers meaning. Eucharistiae sacramentum, and in
tempore victus, and omnibus mandatum a domino: etiam antilucanis coetibus, nec
de aliorum manibus, quam praesidentium sumimus. Oblationes pro defunctis, pro
natalitijs, annua die facimus. Die dominico, ieiunium nefas ducimus, vel
geniculis adorare. We do receive the sacrament of thanksgiving, both in the
time of repast or feeding, and at all times that the lord has commanded, yea
and in our coming together before day: not at the hand of any other, then of
such as be in authority. We do in the yearly day make oblation for the dead,
for their birth days. We think it wickedness to fast on the Lords day, or
to bow the knees.

This oblation might be, the receiving of the Communion together: in that
yearly day wherein they used to solemnize a remembrance of those that had given
their lives for Christ's cause. Which the fathers might well call an oblation:
because they used at such meetinges, to offer of their goods to the relief of
the poor, and themselves to suffer for Christ, as they whose memorial they
celebrated, had done before. But how like you the custom of that time, which
was to refrain kneeling on the sunday, as a wickedness? And how like you
that he calls the sacrifice that you speak of: the sacrament of
thanksgiving? Here is no word of propitiation for sins. Wherefore this
little that you had to say out of Tertulian, is as much as never a whit.

Athanasius says Intelligimus animas peccatorum. etc. We understand,
Athanasius ad Antioch. Principem. Quest. 34.
that the souls of sinners. etc. How far unlike it is, that Athanasius
Archbishop of Alexandria, should be Author of these questions and aunsweres:
may easily appear to as many as will with judgment read them, and consider the
time wherein he lived, and the matter contained in the aunsweres. First it is
to be considered: that he lived about.330. years after Christ. Then that he
was of the Greek Church: and therefore wrote as a Gretian: these things kept
in memory, and the matter contained in some of the aunsweres considered: it
will appear that some Athanasius of a later time was Author of these questions
and aunsweres.

In the second answer, he says, that in his time, the feast of the Epiphanie
of our Lord, was called the feast of the three kings: where as Ambrose, who
lived an hundred years after him, and being bishop of Millaine (whether the
bones of those three, if hystories be true, were first brought out of Persia)
does make no mention of any such feast, notwithstanding that in expounding of
Lukes Gospel, he does speak of their coming out of the East to seek Christ.

In the answer to the third question: he alleges matter out of Epiphanius,
who was not so ancient as he himself was (if he were the right Athanasius)
and he gives him titles of great authority, acknowledging him to be a father
of him and other of his time, and a worker of miracles.

In the answer to the.14. question, he says, that men worthy to be believed,
that were spirit coniurers, had told him, that they had seen the Devil in
his own likeness: and that he had told them, that there is no sentence in
all the scripture that is more terrible to him, then the beginning of the.67.
Psalm. Exurgat deus. etc. Let God arise, and his enemies shall be scattered
abroad.

And the reasons, that (in the answer that you allege) he shows, whereby
we do understand, that sinners souls have some benefit, by things done for
them after they be departed: are not such as should move so wise and learned
men as Athanasius was. One is, the usage and custom of doing things for them:
which (says he) if it were no commotitie to them, would not be continued. The
other is the nature of wine, which (as he says) being fast closed in a
vessel, will when it feels the odor or savor of the vine that begins to
budde in the field: budde with the vine, and begin to flourishe a fresh. Even
so (says he) we understand. etc.

Thus the indifferent reader may see, that I do not without just cause reject
this authority that you allege in the name of Athanasius.

For answer to that which you report of saint Ambrose, exhorting the people
to pray for Valentinian the Emperor. Ambros. De obit. valent. In Philip. 1.
Cor. 15. and in Act.
etc. I refer you and the readers, to that which I have written in mine
answer to the ninth division of your former sermon.

And for answer to that which you cite out of Chrysostom, I refer you to
that which I have for answered to the 30. division of this sermon. And for
answer to that which you allege out of saint Austens Confessions: Libro.
Con. 9. Capit. 12.
I refer you to that which I have written for answer, to the.9. division of
your former sermon also.

De Cura pro mortuis. cap. 1. In Job. Tract. 84. Euchirid. Cap. 109.
To the other three places that you allege out of Austen: I must answer thus.
It appears by these three, and certain other places of saint Austens works:
that he supposed, that prayers made, and almose deeds done, for such as
departed this life in the faith of Christ, and fellowship of the members of his
body: might be propitiatory for them, in such sort as you have said that your
Mass is, when it is taken for the work of the priest. And that the reason
that persuaded him so to think, was the custom of the Church in his days:
which was to make mention of the dead in their prayers, when according to
Christ's institution, they did celebrate the holy Communion of the body and
blood of Christ.

But shall this be a sufficient warrant for us: to think and to teach that
the Mass, which (as it is used in the Popes church) is but an heap of dumble
ceremonies, is a sacrifice propiciatorie, for the sins both of the quick and
the dead? The same Austen wills us not to stand upon his warrandice: but to
be sure that we have the scripture for our discharge. For he knew himself to
be a man: and that as a man he might err. In his third book De trinitate, In
Prooemio li. 3. de Trinit.
he says thus. Noli meis litteris quasi scripturis canonicis enseruire, sed in
illis and quod non credebas cum inueneris incunctanter creed: in istis autem,
quod certum non habebas, nisi certum intellexeris, noli firmiter retenere. Be
not bound to my wrytings, as to the Canonical scriptures, but when thou shall
find in them that which thou did not believe before, believe it without any
staying or staggering: but when thou shall find that in my wrytings, that thou
did not surely know before, do not firmly hold it, unless thou may
understand it.

Again in one of those books that you allege, he says. Euchiridio. Capit. 4.
Quae autem nec corporeo sensu experti sumus, nec mente assequi valuimus aut
valemus: eis sine vlla dubitatione credenda sunt testibus, a quibus ea quae
diuina vocari iam meruit scriptura, confecta est. But those things which we
neither have proved by bodily sense, nor have been or are able to attain unto
by reason: must without any doubting be believed, for those witnesses, of whom
that scripture that is now worthily called divine, was perfectly made.

And in another place he says. De Peccatorum merit. li. 1. Capit. 22.
Cedamus igitur and consentiamus authoritati scripturae sanctae: quae nescit
falli, nec fallere. Let us therefore give place and consent to the authority
of the holy scripture: which neither can be disceyued nor disceyue.

Ambrose also has said. Nos noua omnia quae Christus non docuit, iure
damnamus: quia fidelibus via Christus est. Ambros. de Virginibus.
Si igitur Christus non docuit, quod docemus: etiam nos id detestabile
iudicamus. We do worthily condemn al new things, which christ has not
taught: for to the faithful, Christ is the way. If Christ therefore have not
taught that which we teach: even we our selves do judge it detestable.

These sentences and such like (whereof there be many in the ancient fathers
wrytings) do cause me not to consent to that which Austen writes in those
places that you allege, and certain other of his works. Although the same be
nothing to prove that which you would prove by his authority.

He makes the oblation, whereof he speaks there, of no greater worthiness,
then the almose that is given to the poor, and the prayers made for the dead:
wherefore, he can not mean there of such a sacrifice as you make your Mass
when you say it is Christ himself: There is great odds, between Christ
himself, offering himself to his father, and a loaf of bread, given to an
hungry man. It is manifest therefore, that he understands that oblation that
he speaks of, to be but a mean to move God to apply the merits of his
son, to such as whiles they lived here, did by repentance and faith, make
themselves meet to be partakers of mercy. For so he teaches in plain
words, in the same place that you cite, saying. Sed eis haec prosunt, que cum
viuerent, vt haec sibi postea prodesse possent meruerunt. But these things are
profitable to such persons, as whilst they lived here, deserved that these
things might afterward be profitable to them.

Yea, if all be Austens that goes in his name: there is no propiciation to be
had for capital sins, after this life. His words be these. Sermon. 41. de
sanct.
Non capitalia: sed minuta paccata purgantur. Not the capital, or damnable
sins are purged: but the small sins. Such as the Italians call
Peccadulians, little pretty sins. Yea, and those little sins (says he) if
the fardell of them be great: will weigh you down and drown you.

And to give men occasion to think, that he had no great devotion, to this
doctrine of helping the souls departed: he writes thus, Lucae. 16. August. in
Psalm. 48.
by the occasion of the history or parable of the rich man and Lazarus. Ventri
suo seruiunt homines: non spiritibus suorum. Ad spiritus mortuorum suorum, non
peruenit: nisi quod secum viui fecerunt. Men says he, (meaning such as offer
sacrifice for the dead) do not serve the spirits of their friends: but their
own bellies. To the spirits of their friends departed, there comes nothing:
more then yt which they did whilst they lived here with them. Here you may see,
how little help you have by saint Austens words: when they be better weighed,
then you would weigh them, when you did use them. And when his words in other
parts of his works, be weighed also. Yea, you may see by this place of
Austen: that your purgatory priests, which are hired to sing for souls, do
not serve the souls that they sing for, but their own bellies. And therefore
the cost that is bestowed that way: is but cast away.

The scripture, that neither is deceived nor does deceive: has told us, that
we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ: 2. Cor. 5. Eccles. 14.
and receive according to those works that we have done in our own bodies,
whether the same be good or badde. And the scripture has willed us to work
righteousness before we depart hence: for in the grave, there can no food be
found.

I conclude therefore, that though you could spend.22. hours, in rehearsing of
the places that you could bring in for this point: yet should they not all be
worth a point, because the scripture is against them. So that we may see that
it is most untrue, that the Mass is a sacrifice propiciatorie, for the sins
of the quick and the dead. And that it is most true, that there is none other
propiciation for man's sin: but that only, that was once for all wrought by
Christ in his own person upon the Cross. And that the same is still, and
shall be for ever, effectual to all that believe the promise that God made
therein.

Some think it a great blasphemy, that we should say, the priest applies the
effect of Christ's passion, WATSON Division. 35.
to whom he lysteth, or for whom he makes his oblation. Good people believe
them not, they slander us in this, for we say not so, nor do not apply the
merits and effect of Christ's passion, to whom we list, we do but apply our
prayer and our intent of oblation, beseeching almighty God to apply the effect
of his sons passion, which is his grace and remission of sin to them, for
whom we pray. Only God applies to us remission of sin, we but pray for it,
and by the commemoration of his sons passion provoke him to apply so that all
that we do, is but by peticion and intercession, not by authority as God
does.

You deny not, that it is blasphemy to say, CROWLEY.
that the priest does in his Mass, apply the effect of Christ's passion, to
whom he lusts: for you say you are slaundered by them that so say. I will
therefore let you understand who they be, Who they be that slander watson and
his fellows.
that have in open writing, set out to be seen of all men, slaundered you most
of all: that knowing them, you may give warning to your good people, that they
give no credit to them. Scotus, Biel, Angelus, Vincentius, and Holcot: have in
open writing said, that the force and effect of the sacrifice, is distributed
and applied, not only by God but by the priest also. It shall be best for you
therefore, to have them cited to appear in the Arches, or in some Consistory,
to answer to the slander: for I am sure you shall have your cause heard with
favor.

WATSON. Division. 36
They say, we make oblation for messeled swine, for sick horses, for murren of
cattle, and thus with these vile and odious words they go about to bring the
Mass in hatred with the simple people, that can not tell nor judge, what it
is, saying we have certain peculiar Masses for all those things in our Mass
book.

The matter of this accusation is true, but not the manner. For there be not in
our books peculiar Masses for these things, but in certain Masses there be
some peculiar prayers for these and such like things, and that by good reason.

For in the presence of Christ's body, when our prayers be most effectual,
then we pray for the atteyning of all goodness of soul and body, and the
outward felicity of this world is as expedient for us, according to the will
of God, and also we pray for the turning away of all evils of body and soul,
and worldly goods, always referring our selves to his will, as he our father
thinks meet for us.

Chrisost. de Sacerdotio Libro. 6.
Chrysostom tells, how the priest in his Mass prays for the whole world,
for the whole City, for the sins of all men both quick and dead, for the
ceassing of war, for the pacyfying of sedition, for peace, and the prosperous
estate of things, for the avoiding of all euilles that hang oouer us. For the
fruits of the earth and of the sea, and such other.

De Ciuitate dei. li. 22. Capit. 8.
Saint Augustine in his book De ciuitate dei, tells a story of a Gentleman
called Hesperius, who having an house and grounds about it in the Country,
where his servants and beasts were much vexed with evil spirits, for remedy
thereof came to saint Augustines house, and he being absent, desired his
priests, that one of them would go to the place, and pray, that this
calamity might cease. One of them went, and offered there the sacrifice of
Christ's body, praying as much as he could, that the vexation by the evil
spirits might cease, and by and by through the mercy of God it ceased.

Is not this as much, yea and more to, then we do now? Let not us therefore
fear their vile and slanderous words, nor let not us cease to do well,
because they speak evil. We may not cease to do as the holy saints have
done, because the members of the Devil rail against us, as though we did
naught.

You grant the accusation to be good in matter: CROWLEY.
whereof I conclude, that you make oblation for mesaled swine. etc. But the
manner you deny: which I must either prove, Mass for the rotte of cattle.
or else confess that you be slaundered. In your Mass which is entitled, Pro
peste animalium. For the morayne or rotte of Cattle: you have two prayers, the
one to be said amongst the secret prayers before the consecration, and the
other after you have received your host. In the first you desire of God, that
the offering up of the present sacrifice, may help you, and mightily deliver
you from all errors, and rid you from the incursion of all destruction, that
the Cattle also, which serve for your use, may by his power, be delivered. And
in the second you say. O Lord we beseech thee by these things that we have
received: do thou taking pity and compassion, drive away from thy faithful
ones, all errors, and the perniciousnesse of the violent destruction of raging
diseases in cattle. That such as for their own merit, thou do scourge
being out of the way: thou may cherish by the compassion, being corrected
or amended.

If the leaprosie of swine, the manifold diseases of horses, the morian and
rot of sheep and other cattle, be of the number of those raging diseases:
then do you in that Mass, make an oblation for measeled swine. etc. For what
is your Mass? Su^ma angelica in Miss.
Angelus of Italy says, that it is nothing else, but the applying of the
merit of Christ's passion. And that it is auailable, to whom soever it
pleases the priest to apply it by his intention. Now let the wise judge,
what the priests intent is or should of right be, when for hyre or friendship
he says Mass, to cause such diseases to cease among cattle.

But this me thinks is strange, yt you say that you make your prayer in the
presence of Christ's body: understanding the same to be the sacrament. For
when you make your first prayer, Christ's body is not yet come into your
sacrament: and when you make the latter, the sacrament and all is in your belly.

Chrysostom. de Sacerdotio. libr. 6.
But Chrysostom tells you: how the priest in his Mass prays for the whole
world. He tells in deed, that in the ministration of the holy communion, and
in all his other public prayers: he prays for those things that you speak
of. But what makes this for the proof of that which you have in hand? which
is: that in your Mass for the moraine of cattle, you do not make an oblation
for measeled swine. etc.

As for that Chrysostom says, that the priests office is to pray for the
sins of the quick and the dead: I refer the Reader for answer, to that
which I have answered to the.30. division of this sermon, where you allege
his third Homily upon the Epistle to the Philippians.

Saint Austen also tells a story of a Gentleman. etc. In mine answer to
the.28. August. de Ciuitate Dei. li. 22. ca. 8.
division of this sermon: I have given the reader occasion to consider the
corruption that is found in this work of saint Austens, by the conference of
many copies, whereof some contain a sound doctrine according to the scriptures,
and some clean contrary. Which I doubt not should easily appear in the
Chapter that you allege: if the first copy, or some true copy thereof were
to be had. Lodouicus Viues, in his Commentary upon this Chapter, says thus. In
hoc Capite, non dubium est, quin multa sint addita velut declarandi gratia,
Lodouicus Viues.
ab ijs, qui omnia magnorum authorum scripta, spurcis suis manibus
contaminabant: quorum alia resecabo, alia more meo, contentus ero velut digito
indicasse. There is no doubt, but that in this Chapter there be many things
added (as it were to declare and make the matter more plain) by such as with
their filthy fistes, have defiled all the writings of great authors: whereof I
will cut of some, and some other I will be contented, after my manner, as it
were, to have poynted at with the finger.

This may suffice the indifferent reader, and give him occasion to think: that
this fable which you allege for your purpose, was never written by saint
Austen. You have no good ground therefore, in this place to say, that you do as
the holy saints have done, when you say Mass for measeled swine, and sick
horses: neither to say that we which do say that you do naught therein, are
members of the devil.

Now a little of private Mass, and then make an end. WATSON Division. 37
Many there be, that can well away with the Mass, but not with private Masses.

These men be deceived in their own ymagination: for there is no Mass
private, but every Mass is public. It is called in Greeeke (...), a public
ministry.

Saint Thomas calls it sometimes a private Mass, but not in that respect, as
it is contrary to public, but as it is contrary to solemn.

Every Mass is public, concerning the matter and ministry, but not solemn
concerning the place and other rites and circumstaunces.

Therefore these men speak against that they know not what. They have a new
understanding of private.

They call it a private Mass when the priest receives the sacrament alone.
And this they say is against the institution of Christ.

They say so sine fine, and never make an end, but they never prove it. I
shall show you that it is not against the institution of Christ.

The institution of Christ concerning this sacrament contains three things
which he himself did, and by his commandment gave authority to the Church to
do the same. The consecration, the oblation, and the participatio^. To the due
consecration four things be required, the matter, form, minister, and intent.

The necessary matter is bread of wheat, which is due as it ought to be, if it
be pure, sweet and unleavened.

But our new masters that cry out so fast of Christ's institution, did
ordeyn it should be ministered in unleavened bread, but in common bread, and the
worse the better with them, some said horsebread was to good. Well there was
more vilany showed herein, than I will express at this time.

And for the other kind, whereas the due matter is wine mixed with water, they
notwithstanding the institution and example of our savior Christ, commanded
no water to be put in, raising up again the pernicious rotten and extincted
heresies which Fermentarij and Armeni did maintain. The form of the sacrament
is the words of our Savior Christ, saying. This is my body. This is my blood,
duly and perfitly pronounced upon the bread and wine.

Our new masters that still cry upon the institution of Christ, some said it
was a sacrament or ever the words were spoken, as soon as it was brought to
the Church for the use of the communion, some would have the words said, but
as one should read a lesson or tell a tale, not directed to the bread and wine,
but that the Minister should look away from the bread and wine in the time of
the pronouncing. Fearing belike the words should have more strength than they
would they should have.

And thus howsoever now they pretend a zeal to maintain the institution of
Christ, then they utterly destroyed the institution of Christ, either denying
or defrauding the necessary consecration of the sacrament.

The minister ought only to be a priest duly consecrated and ordered after the
rite of the catholic Church, whose ministration God only does assist. These
men did not only maintain that it was lawful, but also did appoint and permit
mere lay men to minister, yea and lay women sometimes, as some said without
any lawful vocation or ordering at all, Arnobius in Psalm. 139.
not regarding what Arnobius writes. Quid tam magnificum quam sacramenta dei
conficere? and quid tam perniciosum quam si is ea conficiat qui nulum
sacerdotij gradum accipit. What is so excellent than to consecrate the
sacraments of God? and what is so pernicious, than if he consecrate them, that
has received no degree of priesthood? The intent also to do that the Church
does without mocking, dissimulation or contrary purpose is required. For
although the priest in the consecration may have his thoughts distract to some
other thing, and so lack attention, which is a great negligence in the work of
God, and deadly sin to the minister: yet if he lack intention not intending
to do that God commands and the Church does: there is no consecration nor
no sacrament at all. And for this point what intention shall we think these
men had of late that utterly denied to consecrate or receive Christ's body and
blood under the forms of bread and wine, but only to receive the creatures of
bread and wine, and thereby to be partakers of Christ's body and blood? For in
the book of their last communion, these were the words of the invocation.
Good Lord grant us that we receiving these thy creatures of bread and wine
according to thy sons institution, may be partakers of his body and blood.

Was there ever heard of any such institution? Look throughout all the
scripture and show me where, ever Christ did institute, that by eating of bread
and wine, men should be partakers of his body and blood. And if it can not be
showed, as I am sure it can not: then it was a plain forged lie bearing men in
hand that Christ instituted that he never thought, whereby appears that they
had not this intention which is required to the due consecration: and also that
they in words pretending to have a zeal to maintain Christ's institution in
their deeds showed themselves enemies and adversaries to the same.

Going about to prove that we have a new understanding of private: you utter
your own strange understanding thereof. CROWLEY.
I think it shall be hard for you to find one good author: that does use it as
you understand it. You say saint Thomas does use it so: but you tell us not
where. But though saint Thomas do use it so: yet must we know him to be a more
approved Latinist, before we follow him, and make him our author in so weighty
a matter as this. Cicero, and other approved authors do use it, as contrary
to public and common, Solemn is not contrary to private.
but never as contrary to solemn as you say saint Thomas does. Solennis is
properly that, which is used but once every year: and that at a time certain
and accustomed. The contrary to that, must needs be the thing that is never
so used: but oftener or seldomer, as occasion is offered. You say we speak
against that, we know not what, and we are deceived in our own imagination:
but we can prove that you are deceived by your foolish imitation. Your
barbarous babbling lawiers, have used a word of their own making, in such sort
as you would use Solennis, making it contrary to Priuus: and they say,
solempnizare matrimoniu^, for celebrare matrimonium. To celebrate marriage, or
to make an open contract of marriage, in the open face of the Church. The
imitation of these eloquent Latinists: has deceived both you and saint Thomas,
if he write as you report of him.

As for your Greek word, you might full well have spared, unless it had made
more for your purpose: for nothing is more contrary to that which is done by
one alone, and to himself, then (...), is. For you your self say it is a
public ministry: which can not be your Mass, when the priest ministers to
none but to himself, though he do it in the presence of ten thousand, and at
the high altar in saint Peter's Church at Rome, and on saint Peter's day. It may
be said, that it is openly done, and so is secretly the contrary: but it
cannot be truly said to be publicly done, because it is done but by one, and
to himself alone. Yea, though there were a small number that did communicate
with the priest, in the presence of a great number that were not partakers with
them: yet should it not be public, because it is not common to as many as it
should be common unto. So far of is your Greek word: from proouing your
private Mass to be public.

Who they be that can well away with your Mass, but not with your private
Mass you tell us not: but I tell you, that I have said, and do say, Sine
fine, without ceasing, that your private Mass is against Christ's institution.
Yea, I do not only say it, but I will prove it also, even by your own words
concerning those three things that you say the sacrament conteyneth, Private
Mass proved to be against the institution of Christ.
as it is the institution of Christ. I reason thus. Whatsoever Mass has not
all these three things, is against the institution of Christ. But your private
Mass lacks one of them, that is Participation: Ergo, it is against the
institution of Christ. The participation of prayers, oblation, and merits,
will not serve here. There must be participation of that which is consecrated,
that is, the bread and wine. But that is not in your private Mass, Ergo, etc.
Say not now that we never prove, that your private Mass is against Christ's
institution.

Thus going about to prove your negative: you have ministered matter to prove
our affirmative. Well you proceed to the four things that are required in the
due consecration. The first, is necessary matter, etc. We say as you do, that
the necessary matter is bread, made of such grain as is usual in the place,
which commonly is wheat: and wine made of Grapes. But that the bread must of
necessity be unleavened, and the wine mixed with water: we do in plain words
deny. And yet do we not raise up again any rotten Heresy at all. For we
make no necessity either of the one or of the other.

A doctor of your own, has taught us: Nicholaus de Orbellis 4. Sent. Dest.
11. quest. 1.
that it must be usual bread, and convenient nourishment. His words be
these. Non sufficit autem ad hoc pasta, cum non sit cibus vsualis, nec
conueniens nutrimentum. Paste, or starch, is not sufficient matter for this
conversion or turning of substance: because it is not usual bread, nor
convenient nourishment. In mine answer to the.12. division of this sermon: is
to be seen more of this matter.

And your saint Thomas has told us thus. Non est autem de necessitate
sacramenti, quod sit Azymus, vel fermentatus: Part. 3. q. 74. Art. 4. Ibid.
Art. 7.
quia in vnoquoque confici potest. It is not of necessity of the sacrament,
that the bread should either be unleavened or leauened: because it may be done
in either. And for the water he says also. Dicendum quod admixtio aquae ad
viuum non est de necessitate sacramenti. We must say, that the mingling of the
water with the wine: is not of the necessity of the sacrament.

And saint Thomas says, that saint Gregory makes the matter plain,
Gregorius in Regest.
for the liberty that we teach in this matter. For he says thus. Romana
Ecclesia offert azymos panes: propterea quod dominus, sine vlla commixtione
suscepit carnem. Sed certae Ecclesiae offerunt fermentatum: pro eo quod verbum
patris indutum est carne, sicut fermentum miscetur farinae. Vnde, sicut peccat
presbiter in Ecclesia latinorum, celebrans de pane sermentato: ita peccaret
presbiter Grecus in Ecclesia Grecoru^, celebrans de Azymo pane, quasi
peruertens Ecclesiae suaeritum. The Church of Rome does offer unleavened loaves
of bread: because the Lord has received flesh, without any myxture or
mingling. But certain Churches do offer leauened bread: because the word of
the father (that is the son of God) has taken upon him, flesh, even as
leaven is mingled with meal. Wherefore, even as that priest, that in the
Latin Church does celebrate with leauened bread does sin: Both sin a like.
so ye priest that in the Greek Church does celebrate with unleavened bread,
does sin also, as perverting the custom of his Church.

It is to be wondered at, that you will teach a doctrine so contrary to Gods
Vicare on earth: and make so great a matter, of that which he sets so light.
Bylike you had not seen this before you made your sermon. To such as have
said, that some of us have said, that horsebread is to good: I say, that
unless they let the world know who they be that so have said, they are
shameless and slanderous liars. And unless you utter that villainy, that you
know has been showed herein: you shall (by my confent) be joined with the
other.

August. in Ioh. Tract. 80. De verbis Domini secund. Ioh. ser. 38.
The form of the sacrament we know to be the word: as saint Austen says,
speaking of baptism. Accedit verbum ad elementum and fit sacramentum. The
word comes to the element: and so it is made a sacrament. And as the same
Austen says in another place. Est forma omnium rerum. The word of God is the
form of all things. But the due and perfect pronouncing of the word upon the
bread and wine that you speak of: does savor to much of magic, for us to
use or receive. We know that Christ spoke those words that you rehearse: but
that he did breath them out upon bread and wine, or command that they should
be breathed out by his ministers, sub vna prolatione, under one pronunciation,
without pausing or staying, as your Canon does prescribe: neither do we know,
neither can you prove. The use of words, is to teach (as I have noted in mine
answer to the.15. division of your former sermon) and not to work woonders,
as sorcerers do. Christ therefore, in pronou^cing those words, meant to teach his
Disciples by them: that the bread which he had broken and given unto them, was
his body, and the wine his blood, in such sort, as they did well know signs
to be the things signified by them.

Saint Austen therefore, is bold to say thus. August. ad Dardanum. Capit. 12.
Non dubitauit Dominus dicere, hoc est corpus meum: cum signum daret corporis
sui. The Lord did not doubt to say, this is my body: when he gave the sign of
his body. It was no rare thing with them, to hear the sign called by the name
of the thing signified: Exodus 12.
for the Lamb that they had even then eaten, was called the passing by of the
Lord, because it did signify, that the Lord passed by the first borne of his
own people, and smote the Egyptians.

Your new masters therefore, The new masters teach the old lesson.
do teach you but the old lesson: if they tell you that the words be not
pronounced with purpose to change the substance of the creatures, by the
virtue of them, but to teach the hearers, that Christ has ordained a lively
and effectual sacrament, to represent unto the worthy receyuers, their unity
in him their head, and that everlasting life that they receive from him, as
members from their head.

And you are but an evil scholar, that so slanderously report of your new
masters: in whose wrytings and examples it does appear, that they teach and
use that consecration, that Christ used and taught. We (for I take my self for
one of your new masters) do take bread, give thanks to God, break and
divide the bread amongst us, and eat it. In like manner we take the cup of
wine, give thanks, and drink all of it. And this we do in the remembrance of
Christ, as he has taught us to do. What consecration is.
Thus do we consecrate: not by turning the substance of the creatures, but
the use. Other consecration, the universal Church has not yet agreed upon.
Yea, your own school Doctors, are yet at variance about it. Some say: that
Christ consecrated with some other words, before he said this is my body.
Some other say: that he spoke those words secretly first, and consecrated by
them: and afterward used them to declare what he had made of the bread and
wine. And some think: that the consecration is wrought by the prayers that go
before. And they that hold, that it is wrought by the pronouncing of these
words, The papists vary about their consecration.
do not agree. Some say, Hoc, this: is it that works all. Some say, Est, is:
And some say, vin. The first syllable, the Verb copulative, or the last
syllable.

There is no such disagreeing found in your new masters wrytings or
examples. Wherefore, you are worthy to come out of a good school, that can carry
such untrue reports out of the school: and if ever you come in again to be
well whipped, for belying your masters. For we do not under pretense of
maynteyning the institution of Christ, destroy, deny, or defraude it: but in a
true zeal, we abolishe all superstition brought in by man, and use that
consecration only, that Christ used, and taught to be used of his.

The minister we allow not, unless he be called and admitted, according to
the word of God. If any be unworthy that be admitted or suffered in the
ministry: the fault is not in the order that your new masters profess to
follow, Popish shauelings most unworthy ministers
but in the officers that have the execution of the order. And if it were in
mine hand: I would rid the Church of a greater number of your shauelings,
which are most unworthy, though you think none worthy but such. As for the
saying of Arnobius, we regard it as well as you do: as may be seen by that
which I have written in mine answer to the.30. division of your former Sermon.

The fourth thing that you say is required in your due consecration, is the
intent of your minister: which must be to do as the Church does, The sure stay
that the Popish consecration has to lean to.
without mocking, dissimulation, or contrary purpose. And where this is not:
there is no consecration at all. You have brought your matter to a good point
now, your consecration may not be doubted of: for it hangs upon the priests
intent. If he intend not to do as ye Church does, but to huddle up his Mass
for his hyer: then they that gaped for Gods body, have caught but a Waffer
cake, as light as a Butter fly. And they that gave him money, to offer Christ
for their friends departed: have lost both labor and cost, for Christ came
not into his clowches to be offered. And whatsoever thing else, should have
been wrought by that Mass, is clean disappointed: saving only that the priest
has his money, and the peoples folly is fed. A more uncertain thing can there
not be: then when all hangs upon that which no man can know, but he only that
is the doer. Wise men therefore, will seek a more sure stay to lean too, then
your consecration can be: seeing it has not a better and more certain
foundation, then the most uncertain intent of the priest.

What intent we had or have: God does know, and shall judge. Our doings do
declare: that we intend to use the sacraments of Christ, according to his holy
institution, The effect of this sacrament.
in remembrance of his death and passion. And by them to call to memory what
we are by Christ, and what we must continue to the end, and what we shall have
in the end. And being such as by receiving those holy mysteries together, we
seem to be: we are by them assured: that Christ dwells in us, and we in him.
And that as the creatures bread and wine, do by the mouth enter into our
bodies to be the food thereof: so do the flesh and blood of Christ by faith
enter into our souls, to be the sustinaunce of them, whereby both body and
soul shall live for ever in joy.

And in our last book of Communion: our invocation is some thing more large
then you have reported it. For we say thus. Hear us, O merciful father, we
beseech thee. And grant that we receiving these thy creatures of bread and
wine, according to thy son our savior Christ's holy institution, in
remembrance of his death and passion: may be partakers of his most blessed
body and blood. etc. If you would have considered this invocation better: you
should not have needed to have wylled your auditorie, to look throughout the
scriptures, to find where Christ did institute, that by eating of bread and
wine, men should be partakers of his body and blood. For the words of our
invocation are: that we doing that which Jesus Christ did will to be done, for
such purpose as he did appoint it to be do ne: may be partakers of the thing
in deed, that is represented by that which is done. Not by the outward act
that we do: but by the inward faith that moves us to do it, being
commanded by him in whom we believe.

The institution of this doing, is declared immediately after the invocation
that you speak of: 1. Cor. 11.
and was written by S. Paul to the Corinthes. Wherefore, we do not bear men
in hand that Christ did institute that which he never thought: neither do our
deeds show, that we be enemies to his institution.

And as they used themselves in consecration: so they did in the oblation,
WATSON. Division. 38
which they did not corrupt as the other, but utterly took away, denying any
such thing to be, as I have proved it is, in so much that in all their new
communion, they could not scarcely abide the name or word of oblation, but
pulled it out of the book, so much did they favor the institution of Christ
which they now pretend.

CROWLEY.
As in mine answer to your proufes, I have sufficiently disproued the same: so
shall I here in few words, disprove your slanderous report. In our Communion
book, we desire our heavenly father, mercifully to accept our sacrifice of
praise and thanksgiving. And we say, that we do offer and present unto him,
our selves, our souls and bodies: to be a reasonable, holy, and lively
sacrifice unto him. The sacrifice of the new testament.
And is this, to put the name or word of oblation out of our book? The
ancient fathers say, that this is the sacrifice of the new testament: as I
have briefly noted in mine answer to the fourth division of your former
Sermon.

Now when they have taken away the due matter, as sweet unleavened bread,
WATSON. Division. 39
the mixture of the Chalice, and perverted the form by leaving out the
principal verb (est) in the words of Christ, as it was in the last book in
the first printing, how it came in again I can not tell, and neglected the due
ordring of the minister, suffering them to usurp the office of a priest that
never received that authority, neither of God nor man, and in that they did
(which was very bad) never intended to do as the Church does, and wholly did
abrogate as much as lay in them the oblation of Christ's body in remembrance of
his passion, and at length would have nothing to remain, but a bare communion,
what face have they to cry upon christ's institution, institution, which they
have in so many points broken and violated as I have showed? and yet that they
would have is no part of Christ's institution. For the use of the sacrament is
that it should be received and eaten, Concilium tolet anum prim. ca. 14. Conci.
Caesar. aug. ca. 3.
and therefore in diverse councels it was decreed that whosoever took the
sacrament at the priests hand and did not eat it, for the which end Christ
did ordeyne it, was holden accursed and excommunicate. Thus far extends the
institution of Christ concerning this point, because he said Accipite,
manducate and bibite. Take, eat, drink, and also that all should eat and
drink of it, that could prove themselves (after saint Paul's admonition.)

But such things as pertain to the ceremony of the eating, as how many in
one place together, what time, place manner, order, and such like, be things
pertaining to the ordinance and direction of the Church, and not to the
institution of Christ, as necessary upon pain of damnation to be observed of
every christen man.

For else if all the rites that Christ used at his supper were of necessity
and pertaining to his institution: then there must needs be thirtene together
at the communion and neither more nor fewer.

And it must be celebrate after supper, and in the night, after the washing of
the feet, and in a Parler or Chamber, and all that receive must be priests and
no women. For all these things were observed of Christ and his Apostles at his
last supper.

But for our instruction to declare that they be not fixed by the instituted of
Christ, but left to the disposition of the Church, the Church has taken an
other order in these things, wylling that all shall communicate that be worthy
and disposed. So that the number whether there be many or few, or but one in
one place that receive, makes not the ministration of the priest for that
thing unlawful.

And it has ordered that it shall be celebrate in the morning, and received
fasting before all other meats, and in the Church except necessity otherwise
require. And therefore saint Augustine taught Ianuarius after this sort. August.
Epist. 118.
Ideo saluator non praecepit, quo deinceps ordine sumeretur, vt apostolis per
quos dispositurus erat ecclesiam seruaret hunc locum. Therefore our Savior did
not command by what order it should be received after him, but reserved that
matter to the Apostles by whom he would order and dispose his Church.

By this we may conceive that the receiving of the sacrament is Christ's
institution, but the manner, number, and other rytes of the receiving be not
determined by Christ's institution, but ordered at the Churches disposition.

Yet say they, Christ did not receive it alone, but did communicate with his
twelve Apostles, whose example we ought to follow. To this I say, that we be not
bounden to follow this example for the number, but for the substance. That it
should be received of us, is Christ's example necessary, but of how many, of
twelve only, of more, of fewer, or of one, is not by Christ's example fixed and
determined.

Christ ministering the mistical supper of necessity, and that never but once,
for this end by his deed to institute the thing, and to teach his disciples
what they should do continually afterward in co^memoration of his death, must
needs have ministered it to mo then himself, because in that doing he gave them
authority to do the same, and so made them priests. But we ministering it not
for that intent to institute the sacrament, and to make priests, but to
receive the spiritual fruit that comes to us thereby, are not bounden to
observe that number, but shall do well if we receive it either with other or
alone.

You have falsely charged us with taking away the due matter. etc. CROWLEY.
And as for the leaving out of the principal verb (Est) Let him be charged
withal that did it. Narow secking for matters to charge us with.
It is like that you have little to charge us with, when you seek out the
printers faults, and lay them to our charge: and yet confess in plain words
that the fault is corrected. If I would have dealt to with you: I might have
done it many times in these your sermons, as may well appear to the learned
that will read them as you set them out in print. Our ministers be ordered and
admitted, with imposition or laying on of hands and prayer: and as many
ceremonies beside, as may tend to edification. And that which we do in the
ministration of the word and sacraments: shall never be justly disproued by
any of your sort, to be other then the institution of Christ. Our intent in
doing that we do, is to imitate the Church of Christ: and not the Church of
Antichrist, which is the Church of Rome. We offer that oblation: which both by
the scriptures and fathers, is accepted for the sacrifice of the new
testament. And our Communion (which it pleases you to term bare) shall on the
marriage day be interteyned of the Bridegromes father: The Mass has not the
marige garment.
when your Mass shall be turned out for lack of a marriage garment. We have no
cause therefore to be abashed still to cry upon Christ's institution: which you
have and do still, in so many points violate and break as appears by that
which I have answered to that which you have showed, proouing that which we
have, to be the institution of Christ.

And where as you go about to render a reason, and make a proof, that the
Communion that we have is not the institution of Christ, saying that the use of
the sacrament is, that it should be received. etc. I marueil if you did not
blushe when you spoke it. For if that be the use of the sacrament (as it is in
deed) how dare you reserve it, and hang it over your altar, sometime, till
it be so vinewed and mowled, that you must needs burn it? how dare you carry
it about your streets in procession? And how dare you fetch it out in
tempests: to scare the devil withal? Yea, how dare you put it in a purse and
hang it about your neck, to preserve you from perilles?

And I pray you, what moved you to use this reason against us: Nothing more
against Watson then this is.
seeing that you know that we do never minister it, but when we have occasion
presently to distribute it, so that we never reserve it for any manner of
purpose? There is nothing that makes more against your doings: then that
which in this place you allege against us. Take, eat, drink. etc.

And where you say that the ceremonies and rites that be used about the
ministration of the sacrament, do not appertain to the institution of Christ,
we say so to: and that therefore the Church ought not to make a matter of
necessity of them, but leave them to the discretion of every particular
congregation, to use or leave them, as they shall see that they do tend to
their edification or not.

Watsons purpose in speaking of circumstances.
Much a do you make about circumstaunces of the eating, and the number of them
that shall eat, the time, place. etc: but all is to make some show of a
liberty left to the Church, to ordain that one alone may in the presence of a
multitude, celebrate that sacrament, and receive it alone, as commonly your
Massing priests do. But it will not be. For not only the example of Christ in
his last supper is to the contrary, but his words in the institution also:
which words we must hearken unto, and not those circumstaunces which are not
within the compass of do this in remembrance of me. He took bread, gave
thanks, brake it (that is, he divided it amongst them) and said, take, eat,
this is my body: and in like manner the cup, saying, drink ye all of this, do
this in remembrance of me.

If any of them had been so dull of understanding, as you show your self to
be: and would have moved this needelesse question, what shall we do in
remembrance of thee? Would he not have said, take bread, give thanks,
divide it amongst you, and eat it: for it is my body? And in like manner,
take a cup of wine, give thanks, and drink all of it: for it is my blood? And
what liberty is here left to the Church to ordain that the priest alone, may
do this to himself in the presence of a multitude that should be partakers
with him, as the Apostles were with Christ?

The place that you cite out of Austen, is wrested too far out of tune. For
in that place he speaks only of the time of ministration and receiving.
Whether before meats or after: as appears by the words that follow immediately
after. Nam si hoc ille. etc. For if he had told his disciples this, that this
sacrament should always be received after meats: I believe that no man would
have altered that custom. So far of is saint Austen, from confirming the
private receiving of your priest. Wherefore you gather more of his words then
he meant. But this vauntage you have given us by the words of your collection:
that we may be bold to say, that in your Mass there is nothing of Christ's
institution, more then the receiving of the sacrament. The rest is ordered by
the Church. But you would feign restrain your saying to the number of
receyuers: and therefore you say, and other rites of the receiving.

You imagine, We depend upon christ's commandment.
that we depend altogether upon the example of Christ, in communicating with
the twelve: but I have told you before, that we depend not only upon his
example in doing, but also, and chiefly, upon his words in commanding. Which
words are, that not only twelve and no mo: but as many as be christians and
will be present at the action, should be partakers of the mysteries. And that
the action should be celebrated by the Congregation, that desire to be
partakers thereof in the remembrance of Christ's death and passion, and not
otherwise.

The necessity that you say drove Christ to minister to me then to himself:
either fights holy against your purpose, or else one part of it against
another. It was necessary (say you) that by his deed he should institute the
thing: and teach his disciples, what they should do afterward in the
commemoration of his death. How this can agree with your purpose, and with the
rest that you write there: let the discrete reader judge. And how well you do,
when you receive and minister this sacrament to your self alone.

Saint Hierome says. Dominicae coena, omnibus debet esse communis: quia ille
omnibus discipulis suis qui aderant, aequaliter tradidit sacramenta. Hierom. in
1. Corin. ca. 11.
The Lords supper ought to be common to all: because he did equally deliver
the sacraments, to all his disciples that were present. I think that all wise
men will judge, that saint Hierome was not of your mind in this point: for he
says the Lords supper ought to be common. etc. not after your fantastical
imagination, but by actual distribution of the sacrament.

We read even from the beginning of the Church: that lay men and women did
receive it alone. WATSON. Division. 40
And is there any religion, that a lay man may do it: but not a Priest?
Tertulian declares the difficulty for a Christen wife to observe her religion
without offense that has an infidel to her husband, Tertulianus ad vxorem.
among other things says thus. Non sciet maritus quid secreto ante omnem
cibum gustes? and si sciuerit, panem non illum credit esse qui dicitur. Will
not thy husband know what thou do eat secretly before all other meats? And
if he do know, he believes it is bread, and not him whom it is called. Of
this place we gather the manner of the Church in that time, shortly after
Christ, that the people receiving the Sacrament at the priests hand in the
Church, did carry it home with them, and kept it secretly and devoutly at home
with themselves, and every morning as their devotion served them, did receive a
part of it by themselves, and that secretly, least the Infidels among whom
they dwelt should get knowledge of our mysteries. And thus of this place of
Tertulian, like as we may learn, that the Sacrament is not bread, as the
Infidels believe, if they chance to see it: but Christ as it is called, as the
faithful only know, to be so, so we learn also that men and women were wont
to receive it alone without any other company assembled with them, which is
sufficient for our purpose at this time. Saint Cyprian tells of a woman in
these words. Cyprian de lapsis.
Cum quaedam arcam suam in qua domini sa^ctum fuit manibus indignus tentasset
aperire, igne inde surgente deterrita est, ne auderet attingere. When a
certain woman went about to open her chest, wherein was the holy one of God
with unworthy hands, she was afraid for the fire that rose from thence, that
she durst not touch it. By this place appears the like manner of keeping it at
home to receive it alone at their pleasure.

And Eusebius in his story tells that the manner was to send the sacrament to
Bishops strangers, Eusebius histor. eccles. lib. 5. ca. 24.
that chanced to come thither for this end, to know whether they were
Catholic and of their faith or no, which they knew, if they would receive the
sacrament which they had consecrate. Lib 6. ca. 34.
And also he tells of one that lay in exstreme peril of death, who had
committed ydolatrie before, and sent to the priest for the Sacrament, whereby
might be reconciled to the Church before he dyed, the priest was also sick
and could not come, but sent it by the sick man's servant and so forth. Here
it is plain, that lay men received it alone without the priest. And what great
religion is there now new found out, that the priest may not likewise receive
it alone, if the people be not worthy nor disposed at all times to communicate
with him.

I leave out a great number of places that make for the reservation of the
sacrament, which all make for this purpose, if I would spend any time herein
to declare it.

Tertulian, Cyprian, and Eusebius, CROWLEY.
must bear us down with strong hand, that sole receiving of the sacrament,
has been used of lay men and women, even from the beginning of the church: and
yet none of them wrote within.200. years of Christ's assention. In the time of
persecution, when christians looked every hour to be apprehended and tormented
for Christ's cause: they used to come together when they might with any
quietness, A use enforced by persecution.
and did pray together and communicate. And not knowing whether ever they
should meet again in such sort: they used to take some part of the holy
mysteries home with them, reserving the same in reverend manner, that they might
by the receiving thereof, renew in their memory, the thing that the holy
mysteries do plainly preach unto us, which is our lincking together into the
fellowship of members of one body, and our everlasting life through Christ.

This doing of theires, as it does declare a distrust in their own strength,
so it is not to be mislyked: but as it does declare to great a trust in the
outward mysteries of Christ, so it can not be of the godly wise, well lyked.

When the Israelites saw their own inhabilitie to stand before their
enemies, 1 Regum. 4.
they sent for the Arcke of God, that by the presence thereof, they might be
encouraged and made able to overcome them: but when they had it amongst them,
they were overthrown with a greater slaughter than before, and the Arcke of
God (wherein they trusted) carried away from them by their enemies. De Lapsis
Sermon. 5.
And as it appears by that which you cite out of Cyprian, God was not pleased
with that woman's doing. In token whereof fire flashed out of her Chest, when
she having denied Christ before for fear of torments: went about to strengthen
her faith again, by receiving that which she had reserved for such purpose.

But what shall these two examples make for your purpose: which is to prove,
that priests may say Mass in secret Oratories and open Churches, Watsons
examples prove not his purpose.
receiving all themselves, and yet observe the institution of Christ, which (by
your own confession) is, that there should be participation in it? The women
did not celebrate the Lords supper, neither had they any to celebrate it for
them: neither does it seem, that it was thought leafull then to have a
chaplayne of ease (as in the Popes church, every man that will may) but they
reserved some part of that which was ministered in an open congregation, and
presently distributed according to Christ's institution. The examples
therefore, can by no means prove your purpose.

But yet once again, I must put you in remembrance of your old condition.
Tertulians words in Latin, would not serve your turn, except they were
Englished after your fashion. Et si sciuerit panem, non illum credit esse qui
dicitur. And if he shall know that it is bread (that thou eatest) he does not
believe that it is that bread yt it is said to be, that is to say, mystical
bread. But you must not have illum joined with Panem: but with Christum. And,
for (that bread) you say (him) I leave the judgment of your dealing herein, to
the godly learned: who both can and will weigh the words of Tertulian, as they
stand written in his book, and confer them with those words that follow,
wherein his meaning is made most manifest and plain.

And in translating the words of Cyprian, Sermon. 5. De lapsis.
you help the matter a little: For where he says, In qua domini sanctum fuit,
wherein the holy thing of the Lord was: you say. Wherein was the holy one of
God. Which must needs be understood of Christ's own person: Whereas it is
manifest by Cyprians words in Latin, that he means there of the sacrament
of his body. This shift you have shamelessly used in these two Sermons very
often.

The History of Eusebius, Eusebius hist. Eccles. li. 5. Cap. 24.
makes not so much for your private Massing as against your pompous prelacie
of Rome. Ireneus a Bishop in France, writing to Victor then Bishop of Rome:
calls him and those that had been before him Bishops of Rome, by the name of
priests, and gives them none other title of honor. This makes very evil
for the Popes supremacy. But that is besides your purpose now. The Bishops of
Rome before Victor, did use solemnly to send the sacrament to Bishops of those
Churches, that did not observe Easter and Lent fast, as the Church of Rome did.
And so they did communicate together: though they were not in one place
together. What makes this to prove that a priest may say a private Mass: and
deliver no part of the sacrament to other? To signify, that they break not
the bond of unity, though they dissented about the time of Easter and Lent
fast: they did, when they communicated, reserve some part of the sacrament. And
by messengers worthy of credit: they sent the same to those Bishops, yt in
those trifling matters were not of their mind. Shall this prove, that the
priest which says Mass at Rome, and sosseth up all himself (for so slouenly
do some of them use to receive their consecration) does communicate with the
rest that in like manner do say Mass in other places. I trow this history
(when it is well weighed) will teach the contrary.

What needed those Bishops of Rome to send part of the sacrament to those
other: What may justly be gathered of this history.
if they had communicated with them before in private Massing? Your assertion
is overthrown by your own allegation: Because they being far a sunder,
could not otherwise communicate: they did send part of the communion, from the
one to the other. This is all that can be justly gathered of the history:
although we grant that it was the sacrament that he speaks of.

Tomo. 2. operu^. August.
But it may be thought rather, that it was common bread, which they used to
send: which they that received it might afterward use in Communion. For
Paulinus (a Bishop of the Latin Church) does in three several Epistles, make
mention of loaves of bread, which he sent to saint Austen and other: in token
of amity and unity. In the later end of an Epistle written to saint Austen,
Epist. 31.
he says thus. Panem vnum, quem vnitatis indicio, misimus charitati tuae:
rogamus accipiendo benedicas. I beseech you, that you will take and bless that
one loaf of bread, which I have set you in token of unity.

And in another Epistle, which he and Therasia together, wrote unto Alipius,
Epist. 35.
a Bishop also: he writes thus. Panem vnum sanctitati tuae, vnitatis gratia
misimus: in quo etiam Trinitatis soliditas continetur. Hunc panem Eulogiam
esse, tu facies dignatione sumendi. For unities sake, we have sent unto your
holiness one loaf of bread: wherein the soundness of the Trinity is
contained. By vouchsafeing to receive this loaf: you shall make it to be a
blessing. Because Alipius, Therasia, and he, were three that were soundly
settled together in unity of religion: he says that in that one loaf, was
contained the soundness of that Trinity, or number of three.

And in another Epistle, which he wrote to Romanianus: he says thus. Epist. 36.
Ne vacuum fraternae humanitatis officium videretur, de buccelato christianae
expeditionis, in cuius procinctu quotidie ad frugalitatis annonam militamus:
panes quinque, tibi pariter and filio nostre Licentio misimus. Non enim
potuimus a bendictione secernere: quem cupimus eadem nobis gratia penitus
annectere. Least my duty in writing, might seem void of brotherly
humanity, out of the Biscuit that the christians have in a readynesse, in the
prouyding whereof, I do daily labor to provide necessary victual: I have
sent to you and my son Licentius together, five loaves of bread. For I could
not separate him in the blessing: whom I do desire thoroughly to knit unto me
in favor.

These sayings of Paulinus, may give us occasion to think, that the usage of
the Bishops in those days: was rather to send common bread from one to
another, then bread already consecrated. And in this last saying of Paulinus,
it is manifest and plain: that the bread was such as was provided to serve at
need, or in wars, for it was Biscuit, that is twice baked, and without leaven
or salt: because it should not vinewe or mowell in short time. Well, I leave
the judgment of this, to the godly wise.

The example of Serapion, Eusebius. li. 6. Capit. 34.
may serve you somewhat to prove the reservation of the sacrament: in such
consideration as was then to be had, of such as Serapion was. He had fallen, by
committing Idolatry, for fear of torments. He or any such might not (by the
order of that Church wherein he lived) be restored to communion again, before
extreme peril of death by sickness: no not though they sought it long time
with tears. Least such therefore, should lack the comfortable consolation of
the sacrament, in such extremity: some part of the sacrament was reserved to
be given them in such case. Shall this prove, that your Massing priests do
communicate, when they deliver no part of the sacrament to any other, but
consume the whole themselves? I think no wise man will think it.

This history might well have been left amongst that great number of other
that you say make for this purpose: for it does make more against the highest
matter of all, then for that which you allege it for. What opinion think you,
had that priest of the sacrament: when he would deliver it to Serapion his boy,
and bid him dip it, and give it to the old man? Did he think that it was the
very real body and blood of Christ, and that there remained in it neither
bread nor wine? The Cautiles of your Mass do not allow such handling of your
sacrifice. The stuff that you bring to build up one part of your buylding
withal: To build up a cottage, you pull down a palace.
does cast down the greatest beauty of the hole. Reservation in some case, is
by this history proved: and adoration utterly denied. And priestly
prerogative, is shrewdly shaken also. For Serapion his boy, was neither priest
nor Deacon: and yet he is put in trust to carry and minister the sacrament.

WATSON. Division. 41
Well some will say, here be doctors upon doctor of sentences of authors
enough. But what scripture have you, that the priest did or may take it alone?
show me that, and then will I yield unto you.

I shall be content to allege Scripture, as it seems to me, let every man
wey it as he thinks good, to me it is plain enough for this purpose, and
although there were no scripture, yet in this matter which is but a ceremony,
concerning the number of the receyuers, the custom and use of Christ's Church,
is a sufficient rule for a christen man to stay himself by.

The scripture is written in the.27. Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, where
saint Paul comforting all the company, Acts. 27.
that were with him in the ship, who then were in extreme danger of drowning,
promising them all their lives, and exhorting them to take meat, that had
fasted fourtene days before received the sacrament before them all alone, as I
take it. The words be these. Et cum haec dixisset, sumens panem gratias egit
d^o in conspectu omnium, and cum fregisset, coepit manducare. Anime qui^res
autem facti omnes, and ipsi sumpserunt cibum. And when he had said thus taking
bread he gave thanks to God in the sight of them al, and when he had broken
it, he began to eat, and they all being much comforted, took meat also.
Chrysostom expounds this place of the sacrament, Chrysostom. in Math. hom. 17.
where he has this saying, that it is not only a thing sanctified, but
sanctification it self. Here is no mention that he gave it to any other, and
if it had been a thing necessary of the institution of christ, belike he
would have expressed it. Well though it be not expressed in words (say they)
yet it is not a necessary argument to conclude that no man received it with
him. I grant it is not a good argument, but yet this is the common manner of
their reasoning, it is not expressed in scripture, ergo it is not to be
believed. But I can say more for this place, for the scripture calls, that
saint Paul eat ((...)) which is a word whereby the Sacrament is commonly
expressed, and that all the other did eat ((...)) which signifies common
meats, and the scripture says (omnes) all the other took their meat,
among whom there were many infidels, and it says afterward, saciati cibo
that they were saciate and full with meat. But the blessed Sacrament, non est
cibus satietatis, Concilium Nicenum.
sed sanctimoniae ( as Concilium Nicenum) says is not meat of sacietie, but of
sanctimonie. Therefore where it says that saint Paul did eat the bread,
which is the sacrament and that all the other did fill them with their common
meat. I may conclude, that saint Paul did receive alone, whereby is proved
our purpose of the private Mass as they term it. O Lord how would they have
glorified, if they had such a like place against us?

You persuade your self, CROWLEY. Doctors dregs upon Doctors dirt.
that all men marvel at the multitude of Doctors and sentences of Authors,
that you have alleged for your purpose: and therefore you ymagine that some
men will say: here be doctors upon doctors. etc. What other men will say I know
not: but this I do say. Here are the dregs of the doctors, upon the dirt of
the doctors, and shameless sayings enough: but not one scripture or sentence
of any sound Author, to prove that the priest may celebrate the Lords supper
(which you call the Mass) and minister to himself alone. Yea, I do not only
say it, but I have also proved it in this answer already, and will also
prove it (by Gods help) in aunswering that which remains.

One scripture you say you have, which seems to you plain enough: and yet you
think it not needful to allege any scripture, because the custom of the
Church is a sufficient rule for such a matter. But I have proved before, that
the common participation is of the institution of Christ: and therefore can not
be ruled by the custom of the Church. But let us see your scripture.

Act. 27.
Saint Luke writes, that after a long and dangerous storm on the sea, and
fourteen days continual fasting, by the means thereof: Saint Paul exhorted
them that were in the Ship with him to take meat. And in the presence of them
all, he took bread and gave thanks to God, and when he had broken it he
began to eat. etc. Of this you gather that saint Paul did there, and then say
Mass, and receive the sacrament alone. And least it should seem that this is
but your own ymagination: you say that Chrysostom does expound this place of
the sacrament, even in that place where he says that the sacrament is not
only a thing sanctified, but sanctification it self.

Of what authority those Homilies be whereof this that you allege here is the
seuententh: I have sufficiently noted in mine answer to the.13. division of
your former sermon. So that the Chrysostom that wrote them: may be as well
credited as your self. But let us see how faithfully, and friendly you handle
him. He has said thus. Et Paulus nauigans, non solum benedixit panem: sed de
manu sua porrexit Lucae, Chrysostom. in. Math. ho. 17. opere imperfecto.
and caeteris discipulis suis. And Paul when he sailed, did not only bless
the bread: but he did reach it from his hand, to Luke, and to his other
Disciples. You say, that all the rest did eat common meat, and were
satisfied: and Paul alone received the sacrament. Not so says your witness:
for he gave part to Luke and the rest of his Disciples. It appears that you
read that Homily in post haste.

But how does Chrysostom expound that place in that homily that he makes
upon that Chapter, Chrysostom. in. Act. ho. 53.
where the words be written? He says thus. Vt autem panem accepit: gratias
egit Deo. Vide quod ille gratias agit, propter ea quae facta sunt: non solum
illos confirmauit, sed etiam alacres facit. As soon as he had taken bread: he
gave thanks to God. See, in that he gives thanks for those things that were
done: he did not only confirm them, but he does also make them cherefull.

Your friend Nicholaus de Lyra says: that they which were in the ship with
Paul, were comforted by his word and by his example. Nicholaus. de Lyra. Act.
27.
Because he did in words encourage them to take meat: and taking meat first
himself, he did encourage them to do the like. And the gloss upon the text
says. Vt alijs esset exemplo. Iuxta morem solitum in comedendo, and pro salute
nauigantium. That he might be an example to other to give thanks to God when
they take meat. And according to his wonted custom, and for that they which
sailed with him were preserved from drowning.

But you do see more in this text, To what end saint Luke used Copy of words.
then ever did man before you. The two Greek words that be used have a
marvelous mystery. Men thought that saint Luke that wrote the history, had
meant nothing else but to avoid Tautologie: but you have espied that he meant to
teach us, that saint Paul said a private Mass. For (...) is a word, whereby
the sacrament is commonly expressed. You durst not say, it is a word that
signifies bread: least your hearers should have thought that saint Luke
calls the sacrament bread. And you have labored no one thing more in these
two sermons: then to prove that it is no bread. And this word (Omnes) all:
see, how the mystery begins to muster. All the other did eat (...) common
meat. Here is a plain Mass: and not one that receives any part with the
priest. Yea, and this is proved by the plain words of the scripture. O Lord,
how would we glory and triumph: if we had such a like place against you?

I can not tell which of the two is most to be maruayled at: your wylfull
ignorance, or your impudent arrogancy. A man would think, that (you being a
Doctor of divinity) could not be ignorant, of the Concords of Grammar. If a
man should ask you what part in speech Omnes is: you would answer I am sure,
that it is a Nowne Adiectyue. And when you seek for the Substantive to it: you
shall find, that it is Nos, we. For in the Greek, the sentence is thus. (...).
Omnes aute^ animaequiores facti. Or as Erasmus has translated it. Porro animis
iam recreatis omnium. When all our minds were refreshed. (...). Et illi vna
sumebant cibum. Or as Erasmus does translate it. Sumpserunt and ipsi cibum.
They did also eat with us. Or, they also did take meat.

Luke puts both Paul and himself in the number of all.
It must needs be wylfull ignorance, that will not suffer you to see: that
when saint Luke says (Omnes) all, he puts both saint Paul and himself in
the number. And when he says (Et ipsi) and they also: he joins the rest to
Paul and himself. So that the meaning can be none other: but that as Paul
and he had begoon to do, so the rest did also, being encouraged by their
example. And here it is plain: that Luke had begoon to eat with Paul, before
the rest did begin to eat.

If you will needs have this place therefore, to be understood of the
sacrament (as no learned man else will, except it be your Chrysostom) yet shall
it be a communion and not a private Mass as you would have it. O Lord, how
would you glory and triumph over us, pore students of divinity: if you might
but once take us with such ignorant and arrogant handling of a piece of
scripture? You say, that our common manner of reasoning is thus. It is not
expressed in the scripture: Ergo, it is not to be believed. Hiero. in Math. 23.
I would have you once learn to tell the truth, and shame the Devil. We
reason thus. It can not be proved by the scriptures: Ergo, we are not bound to
believe it. And saint Hierome has taught so to reason as I have told you more
then once.

WATSON Division. 42. Chrysostom. ho. 61 ad poul. Antiochinum. 1.
Some bring in a place of Chrysostom, where he says, frustra sacrificium
quotidianum frustra stamus ad altar, nullus qui communicet. Our daily
sacrifice is in vain, we stand at the aultare in vain, no man comes to
communicate.

O Lord how they abuse this place of Chrysostom, that he says to rebuke the
negligence of the people that comes not, they allege it to find fault at
the diligence of the priest that comes. Is it reason, that the priest whose
life is wholly dedicate to the service of God, and to pray for the people,
should sin deadly, if he did join himself more and more to Christ by
receiving daily the spiritual food of his body and blood, because the people
that commonly occupy their life in the affairs of the world be not worthy, or
not disposed daily to receive with the priest?

The very place it self of Chrysostom tells, that the priests did
celebrate the sacrifice daily, whether the people came or no, which they would
never have done, if it had been deadly sin so to do. Therefore it is plain,
that they did sacrifice, they did stand at the aultare, and cried, but al in
vain, sancta sanctis. Holy things to holy men. Cum timore and charitate dei
accedite. Come up to receive with the fear of God and charity, and yet no man
came. Therefore all this his homely was to reprove the slacknesse of the
people, that deceived the expectation of the priest.

I put the case (as I have seen it chance) that when the priest had
consecrate, and one or two were commed up to the altar, and kneeled down to
communicate with the priest after the priest had received, they both departed
and went away, not receiving either of contempt, or for that some sudden
disease or passion came upon them that they could not receive: is God so
unmerciful as to condemn the priest for the casualtie of an other man which
lies not in his power to avoid? Our salvation were a very tickle thing if one
man should commit deadly sin against his will intending to serve god, and so
be condemned for the chance of an other man which he could not stop or amend,
and was no cause of it. Yea but (say they) Chrysostom says. Non es hostia
dignus nec co^munione, igitur nec oratione. If a man make his excuse, that he
is not worthy the sacrifice, nor to communicate, then is he not worthy to be
present there at the prayer. He says so in deed. But what is this, to that the
priest should not receive al one? nothing at al. And yet it serves us to
declare that Chrysostom intended nothing else, but to reprove the negligence
of them, that stood in the place of the worthy receivers and would not come to
receive. We must consider in the Greek Church, how there was certain degrees
of the placing of the people, the priests stood at the altar, the Clerks
within the Chauncell, the worthy receauers, in a distinct place beside the
priests, the penitents in a lower place, the Catechumine which were men,
learning our faith, and not yet christened sat lowest of all, but they were
put out of the Church, when the sermon and teaching was done, and were not
suffered to be present at the mysteries. Now the lack that men do not
understand the distinction of these several places makes them to take
Chrysostom wrong. For in deed he that is in the higher place of the
communicants, and being there thinks himself for his unclean life not
worthy to communicate, and so deceaueth the expectation of the priest that
prepares for him: is likewise not worthy to communicate in only prayer, as
being in that place, and yet has most need of all to communicate in prayer,
because prayer is an humilytie of the mind and a cause and degree to make a man
worthy to communicate in the sacrament. And therefore by Chrysostom he is not
forbid to communicate in prayer, but not in that place, but lower among thr
penitents. For so Chrysostom says by and by after. Quotquot estis in
poenitentia omnes orate. All you that be penitents, occupy your selves in
prayer. And it was a decree of the whole catholic Church, that certain men
which were not suffered to communicate in the sacrament, should during their
penance communicate only in prayer. Concilium Nicenum. Cap. 12.
These be the words of the general counsel at Nice in English. Concerning
them that had committed ydolatry and were in penance not yet reconciled, and
now be departing out of their bodies, let the old Canon be observed, that he
that is departing, be not defrauded of the necessary vytayle of life, but if
any such after he have received the communion do recover and amend, let them
remain among them that communicate only in prayer. We may see by this, that
the meaning of Chrysostom is, as I have declared. Other make an argument of
the word Communio, that the sacrament is called a communion, because many
received it. But this argument is unlearned, proceeding of ignorance. For it
is so called, not for that many communicate together in one place, but for the
effect of the sacrament, because it makes many diverse men one mistical body of
Christ. So does Chrysostom expound it, Dionisius Areopa. Eccleshies var.
Capit. 3.
writing upon the.10. Chapter to the Corinthians. And also Dionisius Areopagita
says. Vndemerito sacerdotalis sacro sancto prudentia ex rerum effectu proprium
illi verumque (communicationis) cognomen inuenit. Therefore the holy wisdom
the priests has worthily invented to this sacrament a proper and true name of
communion for the effect of it, because it gathers our lives that be divided
a sunder many ways, into the one state, whereby we are joined to God and among
our selves in one body, and so forth.

And in very deed we do not communicate alone. For considering Gods Church is
but one house, as Cyprian says. Vna est domus ecclesiae, in qua agnus editur.
Cyprian de cena.
There is one house of the Church, wherein the Lamb is eaten: whosoever does
eat this Lamb worthily, does communicate with all christen men in every place
and Country that be in this house and do the like.

If the priest receive one part of the sacrament in the Church, and afterward
carry the rest two or three miles to a sick man, does he not communicate with
another? and yet that other is not together with him in one place, standing at
his elbow. Even so the priest that says Mass alone, does communicate with all
them that celebrate in other Churches, or in other realms.

We allege not the place of Chrysostom, CROWLEY.
to rebuke the diligence of the priest, in coming to do that which is his
office to do: but for that his doing in private Massing, is one of the
greatest causes of the peoples negligence in not coming to be partakers of the
mysteries with him.

Chrysostom says. Sacrificium frustra quotidianum. Chrysostom. ad popul.
Antiochenum. hom. 61.
Incassum assistimus altari, nullus qui communicetur. In vain is the sacrifice
for every day. In vain are we ready at the altar, there is none that would be
made partaker. He had said immediately before. Multam video rerum
inaequalitatem. In alijs quidem temporibus, cum puri frequenter sitis, non
acceditis: in Pascha vero, licet sit aliquid a vobis patratum, acceditis. O
consuetudinem, o praesumpsionem, sacrificium frustra quotidianum. etc. I see
great inequality of things. At other times, though you be often pure and
clean, yet you come not to communicate: but at Easter you come, though you
have committed some offense. Oh custom. Oh presumption. It is in vain to have
the sacrifice daily. In vain are we ready at the altar: for there is none
that would be made partaker.

If the priests private Massing were of such effect, as you would bear us in
hand that it is: how could the lack of communicants cause it to be in vain at
any time? How could the priest be in a readynesse at the altar in vain: This
place of Chrysostom therefore, Chrysostomes words rightly applied of us.
is manifestly against your private Massing, as a thing that serves to no
purpose, neither turns ye Church to any commodity. And we do not abuse this
place, in that we allege it, to blame your Massing priest thereby, which is so
vainly occupied: and yet persuades the people, that if they be present and
worship and pray as he does in an unknown tongue, they shall have as much
spiritual benefit, as if they were partakers of the sacrament with him. But
all is in vain, says Chrysostom.

Your priest being holy dedicated, to such service of God as is the Mass: does
not by ye service daily more and more join himself to Christ, but to
Antichrist. For his exercise is of Antichrists devising, to the defaceing, and
displaceing of Christ's institution.

The very place of Chrysostom tells not yt the priests did celebrate the
sacrifice daily: but yt it had been in vain so to do, for lack of such as
would communicate. But if you will needs enforce us to allow your conclusion,
wherein you say that it is plain, yt they did sacrifice. etc. I pray you let
it be known to the world, in what order they did sacrifice. If they used that
Liturgy, yt is set forth in Chrysostomes name: they must needs have company to
communicate with them, for it is a communion, and not a private Mass, and
therefore could not be executed by one alone, but by many, which must all (by
that order) be partakers, and afterward call the people to be partakers, with
these words. Cum Dei timore accedite. With the fear of God, come hither.

Such patches you pull out of that Liturgy and mingle them with your matter,
as though Chrysostom had written them in his Homilies. And then you put a case
not worth the debating: Patched ware may not be allowed.
For we speak not of two or three communicants, but of as many as be instructed
in Christ, and ought of duty to resort to one particular congregation, and be
not for their ungodly life excommunicated.

And when we apply these words of Chrysostom. Non es hostia dignus vel
co^munione: igitur nec oratione. Thou art not worthy of the sacrifice or
communion: therefore neither of the prayer: we do not take Chrysostom
otherwise then he meant, because we understand not the distinction. etc. But in
applying the words that follow: you show your self, not to understand
Chrysostomes manner of speaking. Adstantem audis praeconem atque dicentem:
Watson understands not Chrysostomes manner of speaking.
quotquot estis. etc. Thou hear the Beadle that is present, making
proclamation and saying. As many of you as be penitents: pray every one of
you. And whosoever be not partakers: are penitents. These words he speaks as
imagining, that he which would be present and not communicate: would seek to
justify his disorderly and shameless doing, by the words of the Beadle,
spoken to the penitents, in the time when the hole Church prays for them,
before the ministration of the sacrament. But he answers him in few words
saying. Quid stas si es in paenitentia? Why taryest thou, if thou be a
penitent? Again, he imagines another objection and says. Sumere non debes:
qui namque non communicate, est ex paenitentibus. Thou will say (says
Chrysostom) thou ought not to receive: for he that does not communicate, is
of the penitents. But Chrysostom does answer him sharply and says. Cur
itaque dicit: abite, qui non potestis orare? Tu vero stas impudens. Why then
does the Beadle say: you that may not pray, get you hence. But thou being
without shame, do stand still.

Thus it is manifest, that we take Chrysostom right: and that you understand
him not. Although you would seem to have slept upon Chrysostomes grave: and to
have seen in a dream, the several places that were in his Church. The
Clerks in the Chauncell. etc.

I know that prayer is a mean to make a man worthy to communicate: and
therefore, neither Chrysostom nor I, will forbid any to pray. But if any will
shamelessely be present, when the communion of Christ's body and blood is in
ministering, and will not be partaker, but allege his own unworthiness: we
will tell him (and that truly) that he is not worthy to call God his father,
among the children of God in common prayer, if he be not worthy to be partaker
of the ghostly food that God has prepared for his children.

The counsel of Nice has not decreed, that such as recover after they have in
extremity of sickness received the Communion of the body and blood of
Christ, Concilium Nicenum. Capit. 12.
shall afterward communicate in prayer, at the time of the ministration of the
holy communion: wherefore their decree does not make Chrysostomes words to
sound, as you understand and have declared them.

For that other argument that you say is unlearned, and proceeds of
ignorance: you seek a lewd and unlearned solution, proceeding of wylfull
blindness.

That which you cite out of Chrysostom and Cyprian, I have sufficiently
answered in mine answer to the.25. division of your former Sermon. Chrysostom.
in 1. Cor. ho. 24. Cyprian. De Caena.
Where the reader may see, what wylfull blindness it is: that enforces you to
go about to disprove the reason that we make of the Etymology of the word
Communion, by that which Chrysostom and Cyprian have written.

And in applying the place of Dionisius, you deal as you did in the.23.
division of this sermon: following that corrupt translation that bears no
name. It shall be hard for you (I think) to find, in any good Author, (...)
used in that signification, that you do here use it. Dionisius has said.
(...). Ex veritati factorum. Of the truth of the doings. So that this place is
plain against your purpose, when it is truly translated out of the Greek.
Because in ye use of this sacrament, there is a common receiving: Dionisius
says, that the sacred wisdom of the priests has given it a name, according
to the truth of the doings in the use of it, and have called it communion.

But when you take pains to note this place of Dionisius for your purpose:
Watson could not turn over the leaf.
I maruayle that you could not turn over the leaf, and look upon this
saying of the same Dionisius. Post haec extra Delubrum Catechumini fiunt, and
cum ipsis Energumeni, and hi quoque qui in paenitentia sunt: manent autem
intus, soli qui diuino spectaculo, and communione sunt digni. After those
things (that is, after the psalms be song and the scriptures read) they that
be learners of the christen religion, are put out of the temple, and with them,
they that are vexed with Devils, and they also that be penitents: and they
only do tarry within, which are worthy of the heavenly sight and communion.
By these words of Dionisius, is made plain: how well you understood the words
of Chrysostom, that you declared before, and how well the other words of
Dionisius, do serve for your purpose.

This argument of communion was never heard of in the world before Martyne
Luther, WATSON. Division. 43
who was the first father of it, and the first man that ever wrote against
private Masses as he calls them.

And where learned Luther that lesson? even of the devil not because all evil
comes by the suggestion of the deeuill, but I mean that Luther had a vision
of the devil and saw him with his corporal eye being waking of whom he
learned all that he has pestilently spoken against the holy Mass. And least
men should say I lied upon Luther, here in his own book. Ex crete iudico,
serve nequam. We may judge him by his own mouth and his own hand writing.

The title of his book is of private Mass. I shall read you a piece of it that
the truth of my saying may appear. These be his very words.

I shall make confession before al you reverend and holy fathers, give me I
pray you a good absolution. It chanced me once about midnight suddenly to
awake, than the Devil Satan began with me this disputation. Hear (said he)
Doctor Luther, very well learned, thou know thou have said private
Masses.xv. years almost daily. What if such private Masses be horrible
ydolatry? what if there were not present the body and blood of Christ, but thou
had honored only bread and wine, and had caused other to honor it? to
whom I answered, I am an anointed priest, and have received unction and
consecration of a Bishop, and have done all these things by commandment and
obedience of mine elders. Why should not I consecrate, when I have pronounced
the words of Christ and have said Mass in earnest? this thou know. All
this said he is true, but the Turks and Gentiles do likewise all things in
their temples of obedience and in earnest.

The priests of Hieroboam did all they did of a certain zeal and intent
against the true priests in Jerusalem.

What if they ordering and consecrating were false, as the priests of the
Turks and Samaritanes were false and their service of God false and wicked?
First (said he) thou know thou had than no knowledge of Christ, nor true
faith, and for faith thou wast no better than a Turk.

For the Turk and all the Devils also believe the story of Christ, that he was
borne, crucified, and dead. etc. But the Turk and we damned spirits do not
trust to his mercy, nor have not him for a mediator and savior, but fear him
as a cruel judge.

Such a faith and no other had thou, when thou receauest unction of the
Bishop and all other both they that did annoint, and were anointed, thought so
and no otherwise of Christ. Therefore ye fled from Christ as a cruel judge to
blessed Mary and the saints, they were mediators between you and Christ, thus
was Christ robbed of his glory, this neither thou nor no other Papist can
deny. I would read more of this book but for troubling you. He that list to
know what may be said against private Mass, let him learn here of the
Devil enough.

For here is all that has yet been said of any other, and more to. The
Devils derlings were ashamed to say half so much as their father Satan, least
they should be called blasphemous liars as he is.

But by this book, Luthers own confession set forth in print by himself to
the world ye may know that the Devil was the first that ever barked against
the sacrifice of the church, which is the Mass, knowing that his kingdom of
sin and iniquity could not stand, if this sacrifice most adversary to it,
were not defaced and destroyed.

But what color had Luther to publishe this, shall we think he was so mad
as to father that upon the Devil, that he would have persuaded for truth to
the world? I shall tell you shortly his fond devise in this point, as it
follows five or six leaves hereafter.

He says he knows the Devil is a liar, but (he says) his lies be crafty,
he uses to allege a truth which can not be denied, and with that to color
his lie which he persuades.

And therefore (says he) the Devil lies not when he accuses, as that I had
committed horrible ydolatrye in saying private Masses: but the lie is when he
did afterward tempt him to despair of Gods mercy. But says Luther I will not
despair as Judas did, but amend that I have done amiss and never say private
Mass again. O what a cloak of mischief is this, and all grounded of lies and
falsehood. He says the Devil lies not when he accuses. If that be true then
he said true when he said that Luther being a preacher many years, never had
true faith in Christ till he fell from the Mass, nor never trusted in Christ's
mercy, nor never took him for a savior but a cruel judge. Of this the Devil
did accuse him, whether he was a liar herein or no judge you.

Also in his accusation he said the body and blood of Christ were not present
in the sacrament, when such anointed priests did consecrate, and that they
honored only bread and wine, with many other damnable lies and heresies, which
whosoever shall read the book, may find in great plenty, and yet by Luthers
principle, the devil never lies when he accuses.

Four falsehoodes you affirm, in less then twenty lines together of your
printed Copy, CROWLEY. Four lies affirmed in less then twenty lines
together.
in this part to conclude withal. And so manifest falsehoodes: that scarcely
any one of your Auditorie could be so ignorant, but that the same must perceive
that you lied falsely, the communion, by your own confession in this Sermon,
more then once: was heard of and used even from the Apostles time. For
Dionisius Areopagita, was saint Paul's scholar: and you say that he speaks of
it in his Hierarchy, more then once. The action that you call Massing, and we
private Massing: was written against by many before it was brought into the
Church, and by some after it was in use, many years before Luther was borne, as
by Barthram, Husse, Wycklife, and Berrengarius. And although it have pleased
Pigghius and such other, to blow abroad this slanderous lie, to the
discrediting of all Luthers doctrine, as much as in them lies, and you also to
dubbe their lie in the presence of your Prince, who could be contented to hear
whatsoever evil might be reported of that man and such as he was: yet there is
none that will examine the book that you speak of, but the same shall be
enforced to say, that it can not justly be gathered thereof, that Luther did
either see the Devil with his bodyly eyes, or hear him with his bodily ears.
But such is the privilege of the Popes Prelates, when they have the sword on
their side: they may use all untruth in persuading the people (but especially
princes) to think that all is lies that the enemies of Antichrists religion,
have either spoken or written.

You are bold therefore, to lashe out these three lies before your Prince, and
to make up the matter with the fourth: affirming that he learned of the Devil
all that he has spoken against your holy Mass. And when you think that you
have gotten your self some credit in this matter by reading a piece of Luthers
book, and leaving of before you come to that wherein his meaning is made
plain: you conclude that hereby it may be known, that the Devil was the first
that barked against the Mass, as against the greatest adversary of his
kingdom, which could not stand unless that adversary were defaced and
destroyed.

The diligent reader of this mine answer, may easily see: how the Mass has
defaced and destroyed the kingdom of the Devil, in those places where it has
been most used, and in those persons that have most frequented it. Yea, they
that will but enquire of the life and conversation of them that at this day be
Massemongers: shall soon see, how great an enemy the Mass is to the Devils
kingdom.

Yea though there were none other evil in them, The Mass alone is able to
hold up the Devils kingdom.
then only that they say and hear Mass (which is ydolatry): yet were this
one evil sufficient of it self, to hold up the kingdom of the Devil. But
admit that ye Mass were no ydolatry: yet it is always accompanied with a
multitude of gross ydolatries. As the invocation of creatures, the opinion of
meryting by men's own works, the representing of God to the bodily eye, by an
Image made like a man, the bowing of the knees, and burning of Wax and Incense
before the Images of creatures, trust and confidence in the holiness of
creatures, made holy by men, and such like. Thus is the Mass the greatest
adversary that the Devils kingdom has.

But least some of your Auditorie should take pains to read Luthers book, and
so perceive, that you have not said truly of him: you think to prevent that
matter, by speaking a few words of that part of the book, that opens the
meaning of the hole, and knitting up your tale with this exclamation. O what a
cloak of mischief is this, and all grounded upon lies and falsehood. He says
the Devil lies not when he accuses. etc. And if this saying of Luther be
true: then there will follow a number of as great inconveniences, as upon the
words of David, when he says, Omnis homo mendax. Every man is a liar. Psam..
115.
If Luther were in this life: he would not stick to grant all that you
conclude upon that proposition that you call his principle. For which of the
two may be thought better, the faith of a Turk, or of a Massemonger? Seeing the
one denies Christ in words, denying him to be his savior: and the other in
deeds, in seeking salvation by other means then by Christ, which is to deny
him. And wherein shall Hieroboams priests be found worse then the Popes
Massing priests? If you will read the prophecy of Oseas, and understand it:
you shall find that they had as good a color of observing Moses his law, as
the Popes priests have of keeping Christ's institution. And so of the reast,
that you do name damnable heresies. etc.

Now because the time is far past, shortly to conclude, I shall most humbly
beseech you to consider and regard the salvation of your souls, WATSON
Division. 44
for the which Christ's Gods son has shed his precious blood which salvation
can not be atteyned without knowledge and confession of Gods truth reveled to
his holy Church, and by her to every member of her, and child of God, whose
sentence and determination is sure and certain, as proceeding from the pillar
of truth and the spirit of God, by whom we be taught and assured in Gods own
word, that in the blessed sacrament of the altar, by the power of the holy
ghost working with Gods word, is verily and really present the body and blood
of our savior Christ, under the forms of bread and wine, which is by Christ's
own commandment and example offered to almighty God in sacrifice, in
commemoration of Christ's passion and death, whereby the members of the Church
in whose faith it is offered, both they that be alive, and departed, perceive
plentuous and abundaunt grace and mercy, and in all their necessities, and
calamities relief and succor.

Our most merciful father grant us to persist steadfast and constant in the
true Catholic faith and confession of this most blessed Sacrament and
sacrifice, and with pure devotion as he has ordained to use and frequent this
holy mystery of unity and reconciliation, that we may thereby remain in him
and he in us for evermore. To whom be all glory and praise without end. Amen.

To make a short conclusion: CROWLEY.
I will join with you in making humble request to the readers of these your
sermons, and mine answer: that they will have an earnest regard to the
salvation of their own souls, for which Jesus Christ, the only begotten son
of God, has freely shed his most precious heart blood. Which salvation can not
be attained unto, without the knowledge and confession of Gods truth, which he
has by his word revealed to his Church, and does daily, by the faithful and
diligent ministry thereof, reveal it to every member thereof and child of
God. Which Church is, and ever has been the pyller of truth, In. 1. Timo.
Capit. 3
wherein only the truth is seen and does plainly appear to the world, as
saint Hierome has said: and has her foundation upon truth, which is her
only stay and pillar to lean unto, as Chrysostom has written. Which truth
being the determination of God, before the beginning, this pillar of truth,
does still cleave unto: never seeking to determine otherwise, then God has by
his son Christ, determined and taught. In whose word we are assured, that at
his last supper with his holy Apostles, he did institute a most comfortable
sacrament of his own body and blood: to be frequented and used in his Church
in the remembrance of his death and passion, till his coming again in our
nature, to judge both the quick and the dead. In which sacrament is lively
represented unto us (yea even unto our senses): that unity that he has and
does by his almighty power make betwixt himself and us, and amongst our selves
one with another, which unity, the nature of the bread and wine (wherein this
sacrament is instituted) does plainly express and signify. In using whereof,
his Church does not only call to memory, the benifits that she has received
by him: but also show her self thankful, in offering her self a sacrifice of
a sweet savor unto God, by ready good will to glorify him both by life and
by death: as the holy saints that be departed this life, did whilste they
lived here, assuring themselves of his contynuall presence, to comfort, help,
and succor them, in all the necessities and calamities of this life, and after
this life of everlasting joy and felicity, in everlasting life through him.
Which they have already attained unto in part, being delivered from the burden
of the flesh: and we shall in the end of this life attain unto in like
manner, if we continue faithful to the end as they did. And when the day of
the general resurrection shall come: we with them, and they with us, shall
through Christ receive our own bodies again, incorruptible, immortal,
glorious and spiritual, even such as his blessed body is now in the throne of
majesty, to reign with him in his fathers kingdom for evermore.

Our most merciful and loving father, grant us to continue steadfast and
constant in the true Catholic faith, and confession of our hope of
forgiveness of all our sins, by that one only sacrifice that Christ Jesus
made, in offering himself on the Cross once for all, as by his holy word and
sacraments, he does daily teach us to do. And that we may so frequent and
use this holy mystery of unity and reconciliation: that we may daily more
and more be assured thereby of his dwelling in us, and our abiding in him. To
whom be all praise, honor, and glory, for ever. Amen.
