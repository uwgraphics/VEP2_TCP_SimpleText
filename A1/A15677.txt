The Wonders of this windy winter.

By terrible storms and tempests, to the loss of lives and goods of many
thousands of men, women and children.

The like by Sea and Land, has not been seen, nor heard of in this age of
the World.

Lamentable reports of this windy Winter, containing the wonderful, and
strange mischances happened by tempestious storms of wind and weather, in
these three forepassed months of October, November and December, with part of
January.
IN this old, and last age of the World, we yearly behold the strange
alterations of times and seasons, and therein, we are put in mind of Gods
anger purposed against us, by many variable and vnusiall acsidents, happening
in these our latter days, to move sinful mankind to repentance and newness
of life, which if we with the inward eyes of understanding, consider of in
remorse of consience, we shall find that the heavy hand of heaven is laid
violently upon us, as well in taking away our great hope, and earthly joy (
Henry our Royal Prince) as these our late lamentable mischances by wind and
waters added to our sorrows, giving us an outward calamity to our inward
griefs, Heaven, let us not think amiss, if we should presumptuously say it
is for our sins and transgressions, and that they be forerunners of Gods
restles indignation against us; God of his great pity be merciful unto us and
grant us speedy repentance.

We have within these few years, as well within this our native country of
England as in foreign nations, been most grievously stricken with the bitter
blasts of powerful greatness, one while with the darts of death, as by plagues
and pestilence, continuing long amongst us; another time by dry summers, and
parching heates, droughts, and sweating sulphers drying up the moystures of the
earth, to cause barrenness with scarcety, then freezing and cold winters in
more then usual extremity to anoy us; another time by floods and ouerflowings
of waters breaking from the bounds of the Seas, in which merciless element
many hundreds have perished and have lost both life and goods, as the west
parts of England, in the year of our Lord, 1607. can sufficiently witness:
Fiery lesses, by the lamentable burning of many Towns: strange sicknesses, by
corruption of air: dear years, by scarcety of victual, and such like; all
which be the consuming plagues of heaven, laid upon the shoulders of the
sinful world, a burden so easelesse that no release can come but by
forgiveness.

Likewise, dear countrie-men of England, let us now call to present memory
another powerful scourge laid upon us, a daily calamity, these into long
continuing winds and tempests, which these three forepassed Months has,
almost, every day and night affrighted us with fear (as it were) shaking the
foundations of the ground, with rorings in our ears like thunder, the terrible
blasts whereof has with such extremity continued, that they have made many
fearful representations of the dreadful trumpets of Gods wrath loudly blown
from heaven to the earth, the surie thereof (by his divine sufferance) has
mightily troubled (both sea and land) the Inhabitants of many countries, but
especially our native Kingdom, to the less of many thousands which have lost
both life and goods in this mortal misery: therefore let us say with the
Wisemen; Happy is he that is so provided in life, that no kind of death is
sudden unto him, and let us with patience take our deserved puishments, for
the smallest breath of Gods nostrils, like a whirlwind, can destroy the
tottering globe of the whole earth.

It is with sorrow remembered, and with griefs reported in the City of London,
even upon the royal Exchange, the honorable and worthy meeting place of
Merchants; that within these three forepassed Months of October, November, and
December, the devouring gulfes of the sea has swalloed up above two hundred
sail of ships, as well of our own Country, as of neighboring Nations, with
great store of passengers, seafaring men, and owners of the same, aduenturing
their dear lives in the managing of the aforesaid ships, with all their goods,
and marchandizes making for our country, all lost; yea all, I say, in these
three fore-passed months, has been lost and drenched in the deep vaults of
this watery world, a thing both lamentable and fearful, that in so short a
time; nay, in a small part of the year, even in an instant, so many heavy
mischanches should happen, and so many worthy vessels of adventure miscarrie,
which had bin sufficient (if good speed had prevailed) to have inricht a whole
City and bettered a kingdom; but such is the will of God and such is his most
just indignation against us.

It moves my heart with remorse, to think how many people are undone hereby,
and how that some few particular men should suffer shipwreck, and by one
robustious tempest be deprived of that which might have benefitted thousands,
therefore he that will enter rightly into consideration hereof must needs
acknowledge the case lamentable and the sorrow unspeakable.

By certification from men of good account and calling, it is reported and
known for truth, that in the month of October last, a fleet of fourteen
sail of ships making from New Castle toward London, laden with sea-coale and
other commodities of those parts, had their passage by the tyranny of the
winds most untimely stopped, and violently cast into the Oceans womb: in which
ships there perished to the number of a hundred and forty seafaring men,
besides other passengers, both of men and women, which at that time made their
watery graves in the deep sea: This, First struck fear into the hearts of
people, which has been since seconded with many more calamities, which lies
heavy upon the heart of the reporter.

The narrow seas betwixt Dover and Calice can witness many like mishaps, for by
letters sent unto diverse great personages of the land, it is aproued that upon
the coast of France, there has been found floating, upon the waters, in one
week of foul weather, above seven hundred drowned persons of diverse nations,
as of English, Dutch, French, and Spanish, with parts and parcels of many
splitted ships, with great store of goods by the fury of the winds beat upon
the shore, a sight of sorrow, and most lamentable to behold; it is not as yet
nearely known what riches the sea has swallowed in these three aforesaid
months, nor what losses other Countries have sustained, I fear me, the tenth
part is not discovered, for God in his high displeasure, still threatens us
with these long lasting tempests, day by day sending us sorrow upon sorrow,
with hourly news of shipwrackes and losses at sea, the scattering of fleets
by contrary winds and violent tempests, in one place ships cast away laden with
cloth, in another, vessels of salt, some with one thing, some with another,
all rich, and of too great a price to be thus suddenly wasted to the benefit of
no creature.

Likewise upon our English coasts, more near the West parts has been cast
away, diverse other ships, coming from Spain, where in one of them were known
to be seventeen passengers of good reconing and calling, and some of them
citizens of London, which were found dead floating on the waters, some upon
plankes of wood, pieces of mastes and such like, which the fury of the wind
and weather had splitted and torn in sunder, amongst this drowned number
(being a fight of great grief) there was taken up a woman, with a child closed
to her breast, as it were sucking, also two other women, clasped together arm
in arm, as it seemed, dying in each others bosoms.

It is also credibly reported, by the eye witnesses of this woeful accident,
that upon the Western seas, near to the coast of Corne-wal, a certain ship
was discovered, even suncke to the top of her maine mast, with some five or
six sailors, remaining in the top eradle to save their lives, but there
escaping drowning by water, they were starued to death with cold and want of
food, and so found in a calm day by another ship aduenturing to preserve them,
oh pitiful report and full of heaviness.

A number more of the like miseries, has lately happened by reason of these
te^pestious winds, but espetially to the seamen, and such as have committed
themselves, their lives, and estates to the mercies of wind and weather, from
whom almost no other news come, but reports of most dangerous escapes,
terrible shipwracks, with loss of life and goods, the impouerishing of
merchants, the sinking of ships and such like: of which woeful losses, many of
our inhansing extorsioners, makes profit, raising their merchant-like
commodities, with other wares to high rates and prises, working a recouerable
substance out of poor men's purses, careless of passed calamities, ob covetous
desiers, oh lamentable hearing, when ye hearts of people are thus hardened. God
in his high power, prevent their purposes, and alay these great winds, ye call
my weather may comfort us, and ad a forward willingness to al sea adventurers,
to continue their wonted profession, even now (many of them) discouraged from
countries benefits, by reason of these long continuing tempests. Many more
subjects of sorrow present themselves before us, and fills our ears with loss
upon loss, to the heart griefs of all good minds, for this watery kingdom,
this unsatisfied gulf, has clasped into her bosom, to the undoing of many
thousands, a number of hoies, barks and vessels, such as adventured out for
fish, herrings, oysters and such sea victual, into the North seas, and have
there suffered shipwreck, and diued the Oceans bottom past the recovery of man
and help of the world.

It has been certified for a truth, to some of the greatest statesmen of the
Land, that betwixt Michelmas and Christmas last, the seas have bereaved 7000.
and od people of their lives and that at London, and in the coast towns of
England, near the sea side there are known to be fourteen hundred
seafaring men's widows, beside fatherless children, and children
fatherless. Therefore let al tender hearted people say, with me, that these
three months have bin times of heaviness, yea times of greatest grief, when
the owners of ships and the goods therein, for which they have labored many a
long year, and traveled for in many a weary winter, to be thus in one tempest
cast away and lost, and themselves (though escaping life) with their wives and
children brought to poverty: how can we chose, but with eyes of pity, and with
teare-bestained cheeks, being men, much more Christians, but relent at our
neighbors losses, and perticipate with them in moan.

Let us (oh my dear countrymen of England) make our petition to God, that he
would alay this windy instrument of his wrath, and al other his angers opposed
against us for our sins, and confess that our transgressions even stink in
the nostrels of his divine Majesty: he is merciful, and sends us daily (as we
see) examples both by Sea and Land to win us from wickedness.

If we cast but our eyes, upon the City of London and the towns and villages
near unto the same, we may behold the fury of his high offended power in
witnessing the spoils of stately houses, and the high turrets of great
personages, by these unruly winds defaced, and as it were, in their greatest
pride torn in sunder.

Look upon the dwellings of many worthy Citizens of this City, and we shall
see that God is angry, by the unloosing of these powerful winds, and by
suffering them terribly, is uncover their stately Archytectures, vntopping
their peiring pinickles, blowing down whole sides of houses, yet for all this
many of them are merciles, regarding nothing at all the strangeness of these
accidents, nor the fearfulness of these times and seasons, but accounts them
natural, common, and usual, more like unto Atheists, then Christians, but, oh
you temporizing naturallists except you repent, full vials of Gods wrath will be
powered down upon your heads, and all your temporal purposes brought to nothing.

Likewise, let us settle, before our eyes, and in our present remembrance,
these following examples of Gods power, which with the breath of his mouth
works wonders, these following examples, I say, by these late tempestious
winds done in diverse thiers of England, and we shall think the^ marvelous: was
it not a strange accident that a flock of sheep, belonging to a Farmer in
Lincolnshire, near unto the town of Boston, named George Kidman, should by
the aforesaid winds in one night, be driven twenty miles and more, and then
blown into a part of the sea and there drowned, herein was not the wind
powerful? yes, yes, so powerful, and strong, that it even confunds humain
reason to consider of.

It is also reported by letters, directed to diverse Citizens of London, that in
the same County of Lincoln, a heard of beasts by violence of the wind and
weather, this very last month of December, were driven into a Fenny Marsh, and
there most strangely stifeled with dirt and water, the owners of these beasts,
are certain substancial yeomen, whose names, to cut off tedious discriptions,
for this time I omit.

The wind as we may well understand is strong and irresistable, by some supposed
to be a spirit, compassing the world (by Gods suffera^ce) to work wonders, but
in my opinion it is an ayery instrument of uncertainty, appointed by heaven for
the use of Gods creatures, which brings us many times much blessedness, and
purifies the earth from diverse corruptions, but at this time for our selves we
have been therewith much annoyed, as it has here been described both by sea
and land; the violence thereof has caused much hurt in diverse countries, by
raising of waters, and beating in of the floods, and such like; by which means
Travelers are hindered of their iourneies, and many thereby drowned by
aduenturing.

As for example, upon the Wednesday before Christmas last, a man and his wife
riding over Maidenhead bridge both upon one horse, by the fiercenes of the
wind were blown beside, and there drowned both horse and all, God be merciful
unto us, and preserve us from all such like mischances.

The like mishap befell in November last, unto two Yorkshire men, as it is
verified by some Gentlemen of the Innes of Court, and Chancery which knew the
parties, the one of them a Tanner, named Francis Brown, the other a Clothier,
called Richard Smith, both dwelling in a Town near Wakefield side, called
Thereby; which two Countrie-men falling out upon small occasions, wilfully
purposed to come up to London, and there put their Causes of themselves to the
Laws trial: yet notwithstanding came they up together, where, in riding over
a Bridge about Bedford-shire, and conferring of their inward grudges, they were
blown both beside into the River; where, by the fiercenes of the winds they
were most lamentably drowned, both horse and men: and thus by sudden death
ended their malice, to the fear and amazement of all such as well could witness
their envious procedings; these, and such like accidents may be fearful
examples for the world to behold, especially for rich-men, showing to them the
certainty of life and goods subject to the chances of death and fortune:
according to the saying of a worthy Philosopher.

Full little thinks the man at morning Sun,
What hap to him befalls ere day be done.
Therefore, let us pray for good success in all our businesses, guided and
accompanied with the blessings of heaven, and then no doubt but better chance
will betide us then these two malicious countrymen had in their journey.

We have yet more notice, (gentle Reader) of other sorrowful discourses to
relate of, which well may beget your sad entertainment, and possess your
hearts with remorse, for they be strange and fearful, and in the ear of the
hearer full of dole.

Let us now pass into the middle parts or shires of England, and tell what
mischances there happened, the three shires of Warwick, Lecester, and
Northhampton (I mean) where the Inhabitants thereof, with stacks and ricks of
hey, peaze, and beans do usually (in winter times) feed and fatten sheep, and
swine, those countrymen (the more is my grief to report) by these aforesaid
tempests have endured much loss, for many of their sheep and swine have been
smothered under the ricks and stackes blown down by the winds, besides barns
and stables with many husbandly houses torn and uncovered of thatch by the
same: Likewise the dwellings of yomen, farmers, and laboring plow-men in those
countries, have bin ouerturned with the rage of this tempestuous commander, well
may we therefore (if we consider al these things arightly) call this the black
fatal winter of mishaps, in which time many burdens of sorrow be laid upon
our contry, God be our comfort: for alas, alas, the aforesaid raging winds in
diverse other shires of England have beaten down a number of houses, dispearcing
the substance of the poor owners, where many of them perished in preserving
their substance from the fall of their houses.

Yet let us make no question but that God is merciful, and has plauged some few
with the loss of life and goods, (if it be possible) to call others to
amendment of life: Therefore above all things let us take heed, that long
escapes of punishment, or the vain hopes of long life do not delude us, and
make us still run into our sins without hope of return.

But to our lamentable narration again, many the like strange events, fell out
in other countries and parts of the kingdom; as for example, 2. or 3.
sheep-keepers in a part of Salisbury Plain, in the west of England can witness,
who in a most tempestious day, as it is well known in the beginning of
December, betook themselves to a Cabin or Cave in the ground for shelter (as
there be many in those places) where, by the furiousnes of the tempestious
winds then blowing in greatest extremity, the earth riued, and was torn up by
reason of the hollownes thereof, under the which they were enclosed and
smothered to death, from the like sudden end good Lord keep us.

It is also known for certainty, that near unto the Town of Causeby in
Oxfordshire, a little before Christmas last, two young scholars coming from
school the sons of a wealthy Yeoman there dwelling, were by these terrible
tempests both blown into a saw-pit, (by reason of this wet winter filled up
with dirt and water) and there most lamentably drowned and choked to death: oh
woeful and pitiful hearing! especially for the Parents of children, and such
as have the tender feeling of love and nature, that two sweet boys brought up
by cost and care, should be thus and in this manner cast away.

Another sorrowful relation, must I here present unto your hearing, which
happened in the Eastern parts of Northhampton-shire, of a wind-mil, which as
well by the negligence of ye Miller, as the violent force of the wind, causing
the mill sails to exceed their usual swiftnes, was thereby (wanting grain
to grind) by the Mil-stones set on fire, being in the night, the flakes and
sparkles thereof by the fierce winds were blown a long mile off, (as it
pleased God) quight over a Village unto a ricke of pease, where fetting the
same on fire it was suddenly consumed, with fifty fat Weathers feeding thereat;
the rage and extremity of these two great oppressors, the Fire and the Wind,
so prevailed, that not one man durst adventure the saving thereof; and I have
heard it reported by diverse in that Country that the consumed Rick and sheep,
belonged to an extorting rent-racker, a raiser of cheap markets, and a hoarder
up of corn from poor people: here was the powerful hand of God shown,
Heaven herein was just, which would not let such wicked deeds go unpunished;
God grant that hereby all the like doers may take example, and turn their
hearts, that they may be merciful to them that stand in need.

Turn now but our eyes more nearer London, and we may behold the hand of
Heaven lifted against us many ways, yea many ways by these last gusts of
windy tempests for our wickedness, as by trees torn up by the roots, standing
before in all winds and weathers safe and found for these two hundred years
past.

Also, the noble City of London it self can witness much hurt that is come
thereby, as diverse people sore bruised and maimed by falls of chimnies, corners
and sides of houses, the blowing down of tyles and such like.

The very River of Thames, is also a president hereof, where by the rigorous
strength of the winds the water (with the tide flowing ouer-fiercely) made a
most dangerous breach over the banks into the Meadows and Marshes by Stratford
le bow, and Ham, where many thousand akers of fair grounds are quite
ouer-flowne and drowned, to the great hurt and hindrance of many the
Inhabitants of London, as those Towns therabouts, the recovery whereof, by men
of such understanding, will cost much time, with inualuable sums of money, to
the great grief and care of many hundreds.

The like hindrance though not in that kind, befell unto diverse Citizens of
London in October last, of whom I know some now dwelling in S. Sepulchers
parish without Newgate, whose names for good cause I omit, who being at
Sitting-borne fair in Kent, where dispatching their business, and sending
their goods and wares up toward London in a small Bark or Ship, were most
lamentably sunk and cast away in the reach over against Barking in Essex.

In the same County of Essex, at Ilford where a Gentleman's house stands
bravely built with a high turret leaded over, had the log and leads thereon
blown off, and by the winds turned up into a round role, which to all men's
reason may seem strange, that the winds should be of so great a force to
remove so weighty a substance, as that mettle is known to be of.

From hence, if we but hearken down to the Sea side, and at most of our coast
Towns, we shall hear no other reports but of shipwracks and of drowned
people in great numbers taken up, and as it is verefied by some of great
credit, that at one coast Town of England, there has been at one certain
time a whole Cart-loade of drowned men carried from the Sea side.

Oh woeful hearing! oh heavy and sad spectacle! it even strikes my very soul
with fear to tell it; in many places where I have been I have heard bitter
complaints made, some by fathers for their lost children, some by children for
their lost fathers, which the sea has buried up in watery granes, women for
husbands, brother for brother, and friend for friend; sorrow is on every side,
and all wrought by these late outrageous tempests, never the like in this our
sinful age of the world.

But again to our purpose, another accident comes to my mind, which is
requisite and fit to be reported for the strangeness thereof, for it begets
cause of heaviness; a certain ship of London, laden with rich commodities of
diverse Merchants of this honorable City, making for the East countries, and
setting forth before Michalmas last, has ever since (by tempestuous and cross
winds) been tossed up and down the narrow seas, some time upon one coast,
sometime upon another, still driven from place to place in great danger, no way
able (by reason of contrary gales) to finish their intended voyage, but are
now at last cast back upon our own shore, where the Owners are forced again
to re-victuall their ship, to their great loss and hindrance; a charge lying
too heavy upon some men's backs, but God is merciful, and sends these
afflictions to try the patience of his servants, whose losses no doubt but he
will restore with a three fold increase of plentiful blessings.

Thus by degrees do we enter into woe, after woe, where the reports of one
mishap, still proves an induction to another, either of dangers by sea, or
losses upon land, which I am hear bound upon occasion is intermingle, contrary
to true method in writing, but not to be tedious, this must I certify you of,
that there is intelligeces upon the exchange among Merchants, of the
ouerflowing and drowning of towns in the Low Countries, where many hu^dreds
have perished in their own houses, by the merciles seas, driven in by these
late winds, oh heart breaking news: especially to that country people there
borne, and here dwelling in London, in this sudden manner to hear of the sad
farwell of their friends and kindred, thus to loose their dear lives.

It is certefied likewise that the famous City of Antwerpe that flower of
Brabant for famous buildings has had great spoils by this wind and waters,
and that part of that worthy city is ouerflowed thereby, to the impouerishing
of diverse Merchants, whose factors be here resident in England, but because
foreign reports do not much concern our discourses, we will fill up this our
volume with our home bred casualties.

The town of Dover here in Kent, can well declare the powerful strength of
these Winter winds, where from time to time, is vioiently cast out of the seas
whole shelues and heaps of sand and stone, with many other things to the great
wonder of the inhabitants: those that durst adventure to stand upon the shore
side, in the fullness of any of these tempests, did behold strange battles,
betwixt the wind and waters, where as it seemed, waves like mountains, danst
in the skies, T.
and the whole seas appeared like a fiery world, al sparkling red, such was it,
and so terrible, that it even frighted the careful shipmen, to look above
hatches.

The county of Kent has borne a pitiful share of these late wracked spoils,
and has received as much loss as any one country beside: amongst many other
hurts there happened, this one here following, will I make known as a thing
both strange and fearful. About some four miles from Canterbury, at a town
called Great Chart, upon Saint John's day last, being Sunday, in the time of
Evening prayer, the Church being full of people, arose a most terrible tempest
of lightning, wind, and thunder, raging extremely, to the great affright of
man, woman and child there remaining, in the midst of which fear, broake
into the Church a most ugly shape out of the air like unto a broad eyd bull, T.
and dashed the Ministers book out of his hand, with which blow the same arm
and hand was stricken lame and black, whereupon the whole audience so fearfully
pressed one upon another to get forth that many were hurt and almost bruzed to
death, amongst which number a Millor was quite slain, by the fright of this
misshapen spirit, for so was it thought to be, which without doing further hurt
vanished away, taking with it a part of the Church wall, leaving the whole
assembly lying almost smothered one upon another back. It is not for us
mortals, to judge the event hereof, but this is reported of the same town of
Chart, the parishioners have an evil custom among them, for continually, be it
either in service or sermon time, they will stand in troops of four or five in
a company in diverse parts of the Church, conferring and talking of worldly
affaiers, not regarding at all the words of the Minister, but rather behave
themselves as it were in a faier or market, to the great grief of each well
disposed Christian, preparing himself to the service of Almighty God, under
whose shield we ought to make our defense against the temptations of the Prince
of darkness. And now to draw nere unto a conclusion, I think it not
impertinent, nor unfitting to ad unto these our fearful discourses in like
manner a terrible tempest of wind and thunder that happened near unto the town
of Nottingham as it is recorded by I. S. a Citizen of London, and known for a
troth of the inhabitants there now. This marvelous tempest in great fury, the
wind outragiously blowing, came thundering thorough two towns, and beat down
many houses with part of both the Churches, the one of them a vilage nere unto
the foresaid town of Nottingham called Sueton adjoining to the River of Trent,
which had their bells cast to the outside of the Churchyard, and some webs of
lead four hundred foot into the field writhen like unto a paier of gloves:
the River of Trent running between the two towns, had the water with the mud
in the bottom carried a quarter of a mile, and cast against trees, and the
trees torn up by the roots, and cast twelve score off: also a child was taken
forth of a man's hand two spears length high, carried a hundred foot from
him, and then let fall, and so died: also five or six men therabout dyed by
this tempest: God be merciful and grant us patience in such like extremities,
many other strange accidents there happened as then, of the truth whereof let no
man doubt, for of the same there is sufficient proof, and will be verefied, if
occasion serve, God with his outstretched arm defend and keep us from the
like death as many unhappily have here in our Country both by sea and land
tasted, and grant that we may seriously to our own goods bear in
remembrance all these forepassed reports, that they may put us in mind to
shun the ways of the wicked, for all these related calamities have been
laid upon us for our sins, we see how our good Father is loath to chide us
too fircely, and unwilling to strike un too terribly, therefore let these
passed warnings move us to good life, which God for his chosen sake grant.
Amen.

FINIS.
