The woeful complaint, and lamentable death of a forsaken Lover. To a pleasant
new tune.

Down by a forest where as I did pass,
to see what sport abroad there was,
Walking by a pleasant spring,
the Birds in sundry notes did sing.
Long time wandering here and there,
to see what sports in forests were,
At length I heard one make great moan,
saying, From me all joys are gone.
I gave good heed unto the same,
musing from whence this Echo came:
But by no means I could devise,
from whence this sorrowful sound did rise,
But in that place did still remain,
until I heard it once again.
Then presently I heard one say,
O death, come take my life away.
I looked down upon my right hand,
a sort of pleasant flees did stand:
And under them I did behold
a pleasant place with shadows cold.
A sumptuous place was in the same,
musing from whence this Echo came:
Then in that place I did perceive,
a Gentleman both fine and brave.
And from that place he did come down,
casting from him a mourning Gown,
Walking up and down the place,
me thought a proper man he was*
Thus to himself he did lament.
wishing to God his days were spent,
His torments did increase so sore,
his heart was able to bear no more:
I stepped into a hollow tree,
because I would his passion see:
With folded arms looking to skies,
the tears alas stood in his eyes:
And careless of his life he seemed,
pity he was no more esteemed:
Then down he laid him on the ground:
no ease to sorrow can be found.
Thus he lamented in woeful case,
seven long years within few days,
Saying, While I live, I must remain,
I find no ease to help my pain:
For she that should my sorrows remove,
she does disdain to be my Love,
And has been since that she did hear,
that I good will to he did bear.
Ye gods above come ease my pain,
^^^h heavy grief does me constrain,
For whilst my corpse remains, on earth,
shall show the causes of my death.
Every tree that here does stand,
shall be engraven with mine own hand,
That they long time may witness bear,
Love was the cause I died here.
Nature did to her so much right,
scorning to take the help of ^^t:
And in as many virtues dight,
as ever did embrace a heart.
Being so good, so truly tried,
O some for less were deifl'd,
Full of pity as may be,
and yet perhaps not so to me.
When first I saw her pleasant face,
me thought a joyful sight it was*
Her beauty took my wits away,
I knew not how one word to say,
A Gentleman took her to dance,
she gallantly her self could prance,
And kept her order in good time,
I wish to God she had been mine.
But when I thought she had been mine own,
then was she farthest from me flowne:
She gave no ear unto my cry,
which makes me here in sorrow die.
For she was in another mind,
which to my pain I often find,
Of all my hopes I am beguild,
which makes me walk^ in woods so wild,
The second part, To the same tune.

TO silent trees I make my moan,
and birds and beasts do hear me groan,
Yet she that should my grief remove,
disloyal wretch to me did prove.
My love to her was constant pure,
and to my end will so endure,
And Jove to her I hope will send
a grieved mind before her end.
I have forsaken friends and kin,
my days to end these words within,
My pleasure past I now do leave,
sweet Savior now my soul receive.
Bear witness heaven of my grief,
to ease my heart send some relief,
Fair Maids, unto your lovers be true,
if first be good, change not for new.
O young men all, be warned by me:
gaze not too much on woman's beauty,
Lest that you be so fettered fast,
you cannot be enlarged at last.
Some women's wills they are well known,
in love often changing stick to none:
They'l^ swear they love you with their heart,
when mind and tongue are both apart.
My love to her I did reveal,
and from her nothing did conceal,
Though at the first she seemed coy.
she said at the last, I was her joy,
And none but I her love should have,
what need I any more to crave?
But Haggard-like she me abused,
another chosen and I refused.
When he had bewailed his sorrows long,
he took a Lute that by him hung,
And on the lute he sweetly played,
and unto it these words he said:
O death, when will the hour come,
that I have waited on so long?
For whilst I live I languish still,
finding no help to ca^^ ^^^ ill,
Then quite he flung his lute away,
and took a sword that by him lay,
Says, Often thou have been thy masters friend,
and now thou shall his torments end.
He gave true sentence in that place,
to end his life in a woeful case.
The hilt he struck down to the ground,
and gave himself a deadly wound.
Then unto him I ran amain^,
but out alas it was all in vain^:
For long before to him I came,
his death he had upon the same.
I found his grave was ready made,
wherein I thought he should be laid.
And in that place I laid him down,
and over spread his mourning Gown.
Ou^r his Grave his sword I laid,
whereon his death he had received,
Upon his Lute a peale I rung,
and by the place the same I hung.
Then I beheld on every tree,
her name that was his only joy,
Which long before his face did stand,
because she got the upper hand.
This Maid that did do all this wrong,
to live a Maid thought it ore-long,
Married she is to such a one,
that daily makes her sigh and groan,
Her coyness to her former Love,
disloyal then, now truly proves:
Take heed fair Maids, for you may see
wrongs always will revenged be:
Thus you women will use your skill,
let us poor men say what we will.
FINIS.
