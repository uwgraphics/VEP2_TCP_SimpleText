The Lamentatioun of a Sinner.
O LORD in thee is all my trust,
give ear unto my woeful cry:
Refuse me not that am unjust,
bot bowing down thy heavenly eye.
Behald how I do still lament,
my sins quhairin I do offend:
O Lord for them sall I be shent.
sen thee to please I do intend.
No, no, not so thy will is bent,
to deal with sinners in thine ire:
Bot quhen in heart they fall repent,
thou grantst with speid their just desire:
To the thairfoir still sall I cry
To wash a way my sinful crime:
Thy blude (O Lord) is not it dry
bot that thou may help me in time
For quhy whill I on eirth remain,
oppressed allace with woe and grief:
My febill heart plunged in pain,
does sigh and sew for thy releif
Sweit Christ will thou not then appeir,
to comfort them that comfort laike
will thou not bow thine eir to heir,
Lord Jesus cum and be not slake.
For then fall thine ressaue their rest:
their joy. their blys, their perfect piece
And se thy face of treasure best,
O Lord that dois our joys incres
Then sall thou give those Nobilll crowns
Qu hilk thine aw in blud hes deirly bocht
Then sall those Psalms and hie Renownes
Begeuin in grace most richely wrocht.
Then sall thy Saints redeemed deir,
from baill to blys removed be:
And sweitest Christ, thy sweit voice heir
cum unto me Babes cum to me
Cum Reign in joy Eternally,
cum reign in blys that hes na end,
Cum thairfoir Lord, cum Christ we pray,
our pressed grief with speid amend.
Haste thee (O Lord) haste thee I say,
to power on me the gifts of grace:
That quhen this life mus^^ slit away,
in heuin with the I may have place
Quhair thou do reign Eternally,
with God quhilk once did down thee send
Quhair Angels sings continually,
to thee be praise world without end
So be it.
THE PROLOGVE.
PAVLE writand to the Colloss. in his third Chap. sayis, let the word of God
dwell in ow plenteouslie in all wisdo^e, teiching and exhorting; our awin selfis
with Psalms, and hymnis, and spiritual sa^gis, quhilkis have lufe to God and
fauouris his word. We have heir ane plane Text, that the word of God Incressis
plenteouslie in us be singing of the Psalms, and spiritual sangis and that
specially ama^g oung personis, and sic as are not exercisit in the Scriptures,
for they will sooner consaue the true word, nor quhen they heir it sung in
Latin, the quhilks they wait not quhat it is. Bot quhen they heir it sung into
their vulgar tou^g or singis it them selfis with sweit melody, then sal they
^^fe their Lord God with heart and mind* and cause them to put away baudrie and
unclean sangis. Pray God. Amen.

The text of the Catechism.
THE text of the Catechism, or Instructioun of Christian men, quhilk is
necessary till every man that wald be sauit, to know and exercise them
selfis daily thairin, contening the ten commandementis of God, the twelf
articklis of our Faith, the Lordis prayer, of our Baptism, and of the Lordis
Supper* And first the ten commandementis of God at they ar writtin in Exodus
the twenty Chapter.

I Am the Lord thy God, quhilk have brocht the out of the land of Egypt, and
forth of the house of bondage. Thou sall have nane other godis befoir my face.
Thou sall not make to thy self any grauin Image, nor the similitude of any thing
that is in heuin above nor in the eirth beneth, nor in the watter under the
eirth, thou sall not bow (...) to them nor worschip them. For I the Lord thy
God am a Ielous God, and vis^^is the sins of the Fatheris upon the Children
unto the third and fourt generatioun of them that hait me and schew mercy unto
thousandis of the^ that lufe me and keipis my commandementis.

Thou sall not tak the Name of the Lord thy God in vane. Remember that thou
keip haly the Sabbath day. Honor thy Father and thy Mother. Thou sall do na
Murder. Thou sall not commit Adultery. Thou sall not steill. Thou sall not
beir falls witness aganis thy Nichtbour. Thou sall not covet thy Nichtbouris
house, thou sall not covet thy Nichtbouris wife, nor his seruand, nor his Maid,
nor his Ore nor his Ass, nor any thing that is thy Nichtbouris.
The threitning of God maid to them that brekis his commandementis, and his
promeis maid to them that keipis them. Deuteronomy. xvij.
Cursit ar they that continewis not in all the wordis of this Law, to do them,
and all the pepil sall say Amen. Exodus xx. Chap.

The twelf Articklis of our Faith, as they war writtin be the Apostillis to the
three persons in Trinity.
I Believe in God the Father almichtie, maker of heuin and eird.









hand of God the Father almichtie.



I Believe in the haly Gaist.









The Lordis prayer as it is writtin in the 6. Chap. of Matthew, quhilk Christ
leirnit us to pray, contening sex petitiounis, and all thingis necessary for
us. etc.
OUR Father that art in heuin, hallowit be thy Name.











Of our Baptism.
GO our way and teiche all Natiounis, and Baptize them in the Name of the
Father and of the Sone, and of the haly Gaist. Math. xvj. Chap. Go our way into
all the world, and preiche the Euangell, till all creatures, and quha that
beleuis and is Baptisie sall be saif, bot quha beleuis not, sal be condempnit.
ad Titum. Cap. ^^. Not for the workis of righteousness that we haif wrocht, bot
after his greit mercy God hes sauit us be the fontane of the new birth, and
renewing of the haly Gaist, quhilk h^^ sched on us abounda^tly throw Jesus
Christ our Savior, that we being maid richteous be his grace, should be airis of
Eternal life, according to hope, this is true, Romans vj. Thairfoir we are buryit
with Christ be Baptism into deid, like as Christ was rasit fra deid be the
glory of his Father, euin sa we also should walk in a new life.

The Lordis Supper, as it is writtin in the first Epistil to the Cor. ij. Chap.
THAT quhilk I have deliuerit unto ow, I ressauit of the Lord, for the Lord
Jesus the same nicht, in the quhilk he was betrayit, tuke the breid, brak it,
gave thankis, and said. Tak e, eit e, this is my body quhilk is brokin for ow
do e this in remembrance of me. After the same manner also, he tuke the coupe,
quhen the Supper was done, and said, This coupe is the new Testament in my
blude, do this als often as e drink it in the remembrance of me, for als often as e
sall eit of this breid, and drink of this coupe, e sall declair the Lordis
deith until his cumming. Quhairfoir, quhasaeuer sall eit of this breid, and
drink of this coupe of the Lord unworthily, salbe gyltie of the body and blude
of the Lord. B^^t let every man examine him self, and let him eit of this
breid, and drink of this coupe. For he that eitis and drinkis unworthily, eitis
and drinkis his awin dampnatioun, because he makis na difference of the Lordis
body and blude.

The power of binding and lowsing grantit to the true preicheris of Goddis
word. Matthew xvj. Chapter.
THE keyis of heuin will I give unto the quhat saeuer thou sal bind upon the
eird, salbe bound also in heuin, and quhatsaeuer thou sall louse upon the eird
sall be lowsit also in heuin. Quhais sinnis e forgive, ar forgeuin unto them,
and quhais sinnis e retene, ar retenit unto them.

And may our lustis all fulfill,

Quhair money ane for ay sall murne,
And saull and body sall remain,

Endless for ay without return.

Rejoice with Christ, withouttin fine,

And the return, thocht thou to grave were gone.
And will the sone bring into poverty,
Syne give the greit riches abundantly.

And ran him till or he was war,
And gave him consolation,
And in his arms he did him fang
And ever he kissit him amang,
With freindly Salutation.

And cleith my Sone courtly and gay:
And on his finger e put ane Ring,

In his birnand Ire, to judge the world with fire
The day of the Lord drawis neir.
At ane Trumpet blast, we sall be all aghast,
Heuin* hell, eird* sall it heir,
Syne stand befoir the Judge, without any refuge
The day of the Lord drawis neir.
We sall give rekning, of our sinful leuing
We have spendit in all maneir,
As we have deseruit, sa sall we be seruit
The day of the Lord drawis neir.
That day the faithful, salbe richt Joyful
Befoir Christ quhen they compeir*
Bot the unfaithful, salbe richt woeful
Quhen the Lordis sentence drawis neir.
To vnbelenaris all, this sentence give he sall,
With Ire and awful cheir,
Pas e to the hell, with Deuillis to dwell,
The heuin e sall never cum neir.
The Just sall all stand, euin at his richt hand,
Defendit from all dangeir,
To quhome he sail say, richt sweitly that day
The sentence quhill: drawis neir.
Cum heir my Ele^^, and my awin sweit Sect,

Both Saull and body, in heuin Eternally
They sall dwell with me rich^^ neir.
Quhairfoir I do call, (...)
To ryis and be never sweir
Bot ever bewar of the woeful snair
The day of the Lord drawis neir.
A walk ay and pray both in nicht and day
To Christ that coft us all deir
To be our mediator in that feirfull hour
Quhen the day of the Lord drawis neir.

Be glaid in God, for doutles thou mon die.

Think thou mo^ change, and wait not quhair to be,
Think quhy thou come, and quhat thy erand was
Be weill auysit, for doutles thou mon die.
Auise the weill* quhill thou hes time and space,
Exempill tak daily as thou may se,
Quhen deith cummis their is na other grace
Bot eild the than, for doutles thou mon die.
eild the to God with humbill heart contrite,
In Cheritie lufe as thou wald lufit be,
Gif thou wald leif without this warldis despite
Remember on this, for doutles thou mon die.
Remember upon thy God Omnipotent,
That is and was, and ever moir salbe,
And for thy sin he saikleslie was schent
Be kind again, for doutles thou mon die.
Be kind again for heuin Celestial,
Quhair gloir and Joy without end sall be,
Be kind and dreid the cruel pain of hell
Theus thee the ane, for doutles thou mon die.

SEN throw vertew Incressis dignity,
And vertew is flour and rute of Nobles ay
Of any wit or quhat estait thou be,
His steppis follow, and dreid for none effray:
Eiect vice* and follow treuth always
Lufe may thy God that first thy lufe began
And for ilk Inche he will quyte the ane span.
Be not ouir proud in thy prosperity
For as it cummis, sa will it pas away,
The time to count is schort thou may weill se.
For of grene gres sone cummis wallowit hay
Labor in treuth, quhilk suith is of thy fay
Traist may in God, for he best gyde the can
And for ilk Inche he will the quyte ane span.
Sen word is thrall* and thocht is only fre,
Thou dant thy tongue, that power hes and may,
Thou steik thy Ene fra warldis vanity,
Refrain thy lust, and harkin quhat I say
Graip or thou slide, and keip forth the hie way,
Thou hald the fast upon thy God and man
And for ilk Inche he will the quyte ane span.
