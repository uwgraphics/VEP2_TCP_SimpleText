Of saint Steven
To saint Steue^ will we pray
To pray for us both night and day
Of saint Steven gods knight
That preched ye faith day and night

Of Mary mother maid and wife
Therefore the Jews fell at strife
And with steue^ tha^ dyspu^ed they,
The wicked Jews at the last
Stones at Steven they began cast
His head and arms they all to brast
And made his body in foul array.
Steven that was full mylde of mode
Thought he were all reed in blood
In his prayers still he stood
And cryeng to good thus he did say
Lord god for thy myghtfull grace
Forgive the Jews their trespace
And give them grace to se thy face
In the Joy that lasts aye.

Receive my soul I the pray.

A caroll of the Innocents.
Mark this song for it is true
For it is true as clerks tell.
In old time strau^g things came to pas
Great wonder and great meruayll was
In Israel.
There was one Octauyan
Octauyan of Rome Emperor.
As books old does specyfye
Of all the wide world truly.
He was lord and governor.
The Jews that time lackyd a king
They lackyd a king to gyde them well
The Emperor of power and might
Chose one Herod against all right
In Israel.
This Herod tha^ was king of Iewys
was king of Iewys and he no Jew
For so the he was a panym borne
wherefore on faith it may be sworn
He reigned king untrue.
By prophesye one I say
One I say / at lest did tell
A child should come wo^derous newys
ye should be borne true king of Iewys
In Israel.
This Herod knew one borne should be
One borne should be of true lenage
That should be right herytour
For he but by the Emperor
was made by vsurpage.
wherefore of throught this king Herod
This king herod in great fere fell
For all the days most in his mirth
Ever he fered Christ's birth
In Israhell.
The time came it pleased god
It pleased god so to come so pas
For man's soul in deed
His blyssed sone was borne with speed
As his will was
Tidings came to kynke Herod
To king Herod / and did him tell
That one borne forfoth is he
which lord and king of all shall be
In Israel.
Herod tha^ raged as he were wood
As he were wode of this tydynge
And sent for all his scrybes sure
yet would he not trust the scripture
Nor of their councellynge.
Than this was the conclusyon
The conclusyon of his council
To send unto his knights anon
To sle the chylderne euerychone
In Israel.
This cruel king this tyranny
This tyranny did put in ure
Between a day and years too
All men chylderne he did sloo
Of Christ for to be sure.
yet Herod myssed his cruel pray
His cruel pray as was gods will
Joseph with Mary than did fle
with Christ to Egypt gone was she
From Israel.
All this while this tyrants
This tyrants would not convert
But innocents young
That lay sokynge
They thryst to the heart.
This Herod sought the children
This children younge^ with courage fell
But in doing this vengeance
His own sone was slain by chance
In Israel.
Alas I think the moders were woe
The moders were woe it was great skyl
what motherly pain
To se them slain
In cradels lyeng still:
But god him self has them elect
Has them elect / in heuyn to dwell.
For they were bathed in their blood
For their baptym forsooth it stood
In Israel.
Alas again what hearts had they
what hearts had they those babes to kill
with swerdes when they him caught
In cradels they lay and laughed
And never thought ill.
Finis.
This was the tenor of her talking
Timor mortis conturbat me.
I asked that hyrde what she meant
I am a ^et ^ayre and gent
For sere of deths I am all shent
Timor mortis conturbat me
when I shall dye I know no day
Country nor place I can not say
wherefore this long sing I may
Timor mortis conturbat me.
Jesus christ when he should dye
To his father began he cry
Father he said in trynyte
Timor mortis conturbat me
All christen people behold and se
This world is but a vanyte
For therein is but necessyte
Timor mortis conturbat me.

For great fere my soul does synke
