In die Innocencium sermo pro Episcopo puerorum.

Laudate pueri do(...)inum. psalmo Centesimo.xijo. et pro huius collacionis
fundamento.
Praise ye childern almighty god as the phylosophre says in diverse places.
All those things that have the habyte of parfyght cognycyon may move themself
and conueye themself to their end / as a be having sensyble knowledge / and
man more parfyghter / both sensyble and Intellygyble may move themself whether
they will / and so conueye all their accyons and deeds unto their natural
end. But (carencia cognicione) Those things that lack cognycyon have no
mocyon of themself / another be dyrected to their end without the help of an
other. As an arowe of himself can not be moved ne dyrected unto the prycke
without the ready conueyau^ce of him that shoteth / through whom dyrectly he
attayneth his end and is shot to the prycke. In as much then as mankind
is ordained unto an end / far exceeding the lymytes of nature / as it is
written by ye holy ghost in (Ysay.lxiiij. Oculus non vidit. Deus absque te que
preparasti exspectantibus te. Et prima ad Corintheos secundo. Oculus non vidit
nec aures audiuit / nec in cor hominis ascendit que pre parauit deus
diligentibus illum) The eye of a man has not seen / another his eeres herd /
another it can not be thought in his heart the end that almighty god has
ordained for them that loves him. To this end man having the use of reason
and parfyte knowledge is dyrected by his free will as by a pryncypall in himself
to move him to god. And also by faith as a prycypall above natural knowledge
without the which it is Impossyble for to please god and attain to the end
of grace in this present life and glory in heaven / as it is written (Sine fide
impossible est placere deo) While it is so that man endowed with use of reason
/ having natural knowledge and free / may not suffycyentely dyrecte himself to
the end that god has ordained to without the help of faith. As it is written
Iheremie.iiijo. (Non est enim hominis vincere neque viri esse vt ambulet ei et
dirigat gressus eius) It is not in man's power for to overcome vice of himself
/ another for to walk parfyghtly / and dyrecte his gooynge in the law of god /
but by his grace assystente. Much more those that been childern for tenderness
of age and lack of knowledge can not dyrecte their deeds conuenyentely to that
end without special help of god. In token hereof / childern newely set to
scole lacking the use of reason and the habyte of cognycyon have a recourse to
gods dyreccyon. First learning this. Crystis cross be my speed. And so
begins the (a.b.c) In witness of defawte of this perfeccyon in knowledge.
Pyctagoras to the dyreccyon of childern he found first this letter in the
(a.b.c.Y.) the which as Ysyder says Ethimologis is fourmed and made after the
symylytude of man's life. For this letter.Y. is made of two lines. One is a
right line / and the other is half right and half crokyd / And so verily the
Infant age of a child is right neither dysposed to virtue neither to vice as
the phylosophre says (Tanqua^ tabula nuda in qua nichil depingitur) But the
second age is called Adolescencia / and has two lines a right and a crokyd /
sygnefyenge the dysposycyon that he has then to vice and then^e to virtue.
In the which age is the brekynge of every child or to goodness or to lewdenes.
Therefore that age is most uncertain in knowledge as Solomon says (Prouerbio
ru^.xxxo. Tria su^t michi difficilia ad cognoscendu^ et quartu^ penitus ignoro
Viam nauis in medio maris. et viam viri in adolescentia) Three things says
Solomon ben hard to me to know / and the fourth utterly I know not. The
flight of the Egle in the air / The way of the serpent on the earth. The
sayllynge of a ship in the sea. But the fourth and most hardest is to
understand the way of a man in his growing age / Tho childern then the
which lack dyscrecyon / use of reason / and parfyght cognycyon / and yet
attain to the end that is prepared for man's bliss. As these blessed
Innocents whoos solempnyte we halowe this day (Qui non loquendo sed moriendo
confessi sunt) May most in a special laud that glorious lord (Sequentes
agnum quocu^que ierit) To whom by our mother holy church / in title of tryumphe
may contynually be applied the words of my time (Laudate pueri dominum) Ye
chosen childern of god lacking the use of cognycyon / and yet gloryfyed by
your passion in life ever lasting praise ye god.

In the beginning then of this simple exhortacyon / that I a child wantynge
the habyte of conning may be dyrected by him / that gave to that child
Danyell (Sermone^ rectum et spiritum deorum) Somewhat to say to his laud and
praysynge / and to all pure childern that been here present edifyenge we shall
at this time devoutly make our prayers. In the which prayers I reco^mende
unto your deuocyons the welfare of all Crystys church. Our holy fader the Pope
with all the clergy / my lord of Caunterbury / and the right reverend fader
and worshypfull lord my brother bysshopp of London your Dyocesan. Also for my
worshypfull brother Deane of this cathedral church with all resydensaryes and
prebendaryes of the same. And most Intyerly I pray you to have myself in your
specyal devotion / so that I may continue in this degree that I now stand. And
never more herafter to be vexed with Ieroms vysyon / the which is written.
(Jeremy primo) When the good lord asked of Ieremye (Quid tu vides Ieremia) He
answered and said (Virgam vigilantem ego video) A waken rod I see said
Ieremye. Truly this waken rod oftentimes has troubled me in my childehode /
that (lumbi mei impleti sunt illusionibus et non est sanitas in carne mea.
Afflictus sum et humiliatus sum nimis) And therefore though I be now in hye
dygnyte / yet when I see other here my master yt was then (Operuit confusio
faciem meam. A voce contremueru^t labia mea) As Nero the Emperor would to his
master Seneca / the same wysshe I would to my master I love so well / and for
their true dylygence that all my masters the which taught me any conning in
my youth gave to me. I would that they were promytted to be perpetual fellows
and collegeners of that famous college of the kings fou^dacyon in South work
/ that men call the kings Benche / gretter worship I can not wysshe. than
for to sytte in to the kings own benche / and for by cause Charity is
parfyght if it be extended as well to the end of the life as it is the life
self. I would they should end their life in that holy way / the which
oftentimes I radde when that I was Querester in the Marteloge of Poules / where
many holy bodies deyed / and is called in latin (Via tiburtina) In English as
much to say. as the high way to Tyburne. In this behalf ye shall pray
specially for all prelates that comes to their dygnytee as I did. For thanked
be god without conspyracy lordshyp or symony I was set in this degree / For
verily promocyon in any realm had (Per demonu^. simone^ et princi pem) has
and shall bring Crystys church (in co^fusione^ dampnabilem) In the second
party ye shall pray for the well and peace of all Christian reames / specially
for the reame of England. Our sovereign lord the king. Our sovereign lady the
queen. My lord the prince. My lady the kings mother. My lord her husbonde /
with all the lords of the Realm. The welfare of this Cite. For my right
worshypful brother and lover the Mayer with all the Aldermen. and Shyrefs. In
the third party all the souls lyenge in the pains of purgatory. Specially
for the soul of the reuerrnde fader my lord Thomas kempe late bishop And for
the souls of all benefactours of this church of Poules / with all Christian
souls / for the which and for the intent premysed. I pray you devoutly say
a (Pater nr^) and an (Aue)

Laudate pueri dn^m. vt supra.
In as much as Christ says in the Gospel. (Sinite peruulos venire ad me quia
taliu^ est regnum celorum. Mathei..xixo.) Suffer ye childern to come to me. For
of such the kingdom of heaven is fulfilled / by whom after saint Austyn (in
originali vbi thema) It is not oonly understand those that been childern of
age. But those that been childern pure in clennesse from sin and malice. As
the holy appostle saint Poule says (Nolite effici pueri sensibus. malicia
autem paruuli estote. prima ad Corintheos xiiijo.) Be ye not childern in your
wits / but from all sin and malice / be ye childern in clennesse / And in
this form all manner of people / and all manner of ages in cle^nesse of life
ought to be pure as childern / to whom generally may I say (Laudate pueri
dn^m. laudate pueri dn^m in infancia. laudate dn^m in adolescencia. laudate
dn^m in perseuerante etate humana) Praise ye childern your god in your Infant
age / praise ye him in your growing age / and praise ye him perseuerauntly.
(Vsque in senectu^ et seniu^) In your man's age / And in these three praysynge
of three ages shall stand the process of this simple collacyon.

These three ages after the consceyte of the appostle (ad Galathas) and (ad
Romanos) is lykened to the three laws That is to say / to the law of kind /
the law written / and the law of grace. The first age is lykened unto the
law of kind. A child first when he is in his Infant age is not constreyned
unto no laws / he is not corrected another beten / and there is no defaute
laid unto him / but utterly he is left unto the law of kind. Do he what
someuer he will / no man does blame him. Morally the state of man jnmedyatly
after sin was verily the state of childehode and Infans having no nouryce.
When that man was utterly left without any expressyd law / having no master
to his own natural Inclynacyon / as to his law / there was no law of god
new put to him / Many defawtes did he and to many Inconuenyences he ran.
Correccyon was there none / but utter destruccyon / as Noes flood destroyenge
all Infantes of mankind save.viij. persons (Genesis.vijo.) The destruccyon
of Sodom and of Gomor with other cytees (Genesis.xixo.) And like wise as a
child having no nouryce nor guyder deputed to him may as well run in to
the fire or water as to go beside. So verily in the first age of man in the
law of kind. A man being without a nouryce or guyder left to his natural
guydynge mysused so far himself that he ran to water / where he was
utterly destroyed as I said before / save Noes household / and also to the fire
where a great part was destroyed. And verily masters if we clearly consydre
our life and state that we stand in now in these days I fere me we shall find
our self so far guyded by our sensual nature that we shall need to be
purefyed to our streyte correccyon with a streyte afflyccyon / as the water or
the fire / and all for lack of our masters and nouryces all wrapped in
neclygence takes none attendaunce to us / Our masters and nouryce spyrytuall
(Querentur que sua sunt. Et non que ihesu xp^i. sunt canes muti non valentes
latrare / Ysaye.lvio.) Our temporal rulers (Infideles socij furum diligunt
munera sequuntur retribuco^is pupillo no^ iudicant causa vidue non ingreditur
ad cos. Ysaye.io.) This neclygence in our nouryces spyrytuall and temporal
causes in the church Insolent life seculer co^uersacyon (In habitu interiori
et exteriori vt qualis populus talis sit et sa cerdos) In the temporalte it
causes yt manslaughter is not set by / lechery is pleasure / robbery and
dysceyte is called cheuesaunce / extorcyon lordshyp / power / falsehede / a
fete of wit / usury counted no sin (Quomodo facta est meretrix ciuitas
fidelis plena iudicij. Iusticia habitauit in ea. nu^c autem homicide. Argentu^
tuu^ versum est in scoriam. vinu^ tuum mixtu^ est aqua. Ysaye.io.) A
merueyllous change / sometime our reame was prosperous / now it is in mysery /
sometime ryghtwysnesse was the chyef ruler. now falshede is quarter master /
sometime was Inhabytaunt peace love and charity / now wrath and manslaughter /
and false dyssymulacyon. Sometime troth was master of our merchants (nu^c
vero usure et dolus) And sometime troth stood up right / now he is fallen /
Good men have Inserched the street where he fell. Some said he fell in
Lombarde street / some said in Buklars bury / and when it was utterly know /
he was fallen in every street (Veritas corruit in plateis) The cause is none
other but we lack our masters and guyders that should streytly attend in
this Infant age of condycyon that we ben in.

When that Infant age is ended / the fader prouydeth for his child / for a
master the which gives Instruccyon in small doctrynes / as in his Donate.
Parts of reason / and such other / the which master comunely is called
Pedagogis in latin. This master gives commandments to the child in his
growing age And he break them he is sharply corrected / there is no fawte
that he does but he is punysshed. Sometime he wryngeth him by the eeres /
sometime he gives him a strype on the hand with the ferell / some time beteth
him sharply with the rod. And so with commandments and sharp correccyon
he gives him full Instruccyon in the lawer science. So in like manner after the
law of kind. As mankind grew in age / almighty god provided to man an
enfourmer that was called Moses / the which should teache man his pryncypalles
and small and rude doctrynes. And so the old law taught to man his Donate and
Parts of reason. Also he taught him how he should give to god his parts / the
which were sacrefyces / oblacyons / and tithes Justly and truly to be given
to god / as it is written (Ecclesiasticis.xxxvo.. Da altissimo secundum donatum
eius) That what thou sholdest give to thy neighbor and brother his parts. That
is for to say / Almesdedes freely without grutchynge. Lenynge of thy good
without any trust or hope of usury / and forgeuy^ge thy neighbor if he be in
necessyte with out trouble for gods sake. And like wise as the people under
Moses growing in childhode / these things were taught by the which
specially gods law and praysynge was encreaced. So in our growing age in
virtue that good lord (cuius laus est in ecclia sco^rum) can not be better
praised than if we give unto him Justly and truly his donat / to hy^ oblacyons
sacrefyces and tithes. To our neighbor mercyfully give our alms. And
pyteuously forgive offenses and dettes to them that been nedy and may not pay.
These ben the things that longs to gods praysynge in mankyndes childehode
/ as it is written of Thoby (Thobie prio. Hec et his similia puerulus secundu^
legem obseruabant) In Moses time streyte commandments were given to man /
streyte punysshementes / and sharp correccyons / they were taken by the eere
streytly / when it commanded in the law / (Aurem pro aure. dente^ pro dente)
without any mercy / he that gadred styckes on the Sabot day was stoned unto
the death. And for one grutched against their master Moses / yt which was but
Pedagogus / the chosen woman most accept Maria Aarons sister was smytten of
god with the Infyrmyte of leprehode. How oftetymes break we our holy day / how
oftymes grutche we against our masters / not holding us content with no king
another prince / archebysshop nor bishop. Being as varyaunt as the moon / and
yet the good lord spared us. The old law was hard to observe / in the
which time god entreated mankind after his wrath and punysshement / Wherefore
he was called (deus vlcionu^) For whoos deliver mercy cried to almighty god to
send mankind a new master yt should entreat him and teache more curtously
and it lyked him (Non ex operibus iusticie q^ fecimus nos. sed secundu^ sua^
misericordia^. ad Titu^.iijo.) To come down himself / and took on him our
mortallyte / gave us a new law / would suffer none but himself to be our
master / Wherewith all love and benygnyte without sharpness he taught us. No
rude another gross erthely doctrynes / as they were taught in the old law. But
he taught us subtle things / heavenly dyuynytee / our glory and our bliss
(Docebat eos de regno dei) And as long as we ben in the scole of merciful
benygnytee and gentylnesse / though we do fawtes purposynge to amend. So long
he abides us pacyently holding himself content / For by cause we ben now in
man's state and parfyght age with our own correccyon (Propterea expectat deus
vt misereatur vestri. Ysaye.xxxo.) And if we dyfferre and will not correct our
self here in the scole of mercy / full grievously and most sharply shall we
abide the sword of correccyon of his ryghtwysnesse / as daily by experyence we
may feel. Therefore in the three ages of our life let us besye our self to
praise god with pure childern. Amendynge our life by deeds of penance. And
virtuous deeds using. exhorting you with the words of my time (Laudate pueri
dn^m)

The form and the manner how that we should worship and love almighty god in
the three ages / that is to say. In childehode. Yongthe / and Manhood. Is
showed to us by a pretty conceyte of our common calendar / in every book of
service. Ye shall understand that every month noted in the calendar is
dyuyded in three parties. That is to say (Kalendas. Nonas and Ydus) The first
day of every month is called and named Kalendas The second is named not
Kalendas / but Quarto Quinto or Sexto Nonas. And so till ye come to Nonas. And
after Nonas the days ben named Ydus till ye come to the myddell / and then
all the month after named Kalendas after certain nombres as the mids of the
month is names.xix. other.xviij. Kalendas cou^tynge less till ye come to the
end. Morally by these three. Kalendas. Nonas and Ydus / is understand the three
ages of man. By Kalendas is understand childehode. Kalende is as much to say
(Quasi colendo) For the consuetude of the Romans was the first day of the
month / that is called Kalendas / falls to solempnyse to their gods Hely
Juno and Iupyter. So verily the childehode of man is dedycate to devotion /
then set the faders the childern to scole. And then be they taught to
serve god / and to say grace / to help the priest to sing / for to be meke
gentle and lowely Then say they our lady matens and ben right devout. Of
whom may be verefyed that is written by Dauyd (Hec est generacio querenciu^
dn^m) yt is the generacyon that be sely by devotion seek almighty god. By the
second day that is called Nonas I understand the second age that is called
(Iuuentus) youth (Non dicuntur quasi nulle) For in yt day the Romans
worshypt no gods / another in yt season was no festyuall days / or else
(None dicuntur quasi nu^dine) As much to say as a fayer. For in that time
they occupied themself in fayers and marchau^dyses / And herto conuenyently may
be ye youth of man applied / that is in special from.xiiij. years unto.xviij.
In the which he is full of vndeuocyon / and all most forgeteth to worship his
god or any saint And if he do it with his mouth / his heart is full far from
god about worldly vanytees / as it is written (Populus hic labijs me honorat /
cor aute^ eorum long e^ a me. Ysay.xxixo.) Congruently also youth may be named
(None.i. nundine) a fayer or market. For in this age is the marchaundyse of the
devil. The world habundau^tly bought. Here the young man byeth a stro^pettes
body for his body and soul. Here all vain marchau^dyses of ye world ben
bought / to the which is very prone / and ready our youth of England as we
may see daily / there is no vanyte in no party of the world but we ben ready to
bye it. Long here is and short collers of Almayns. Evil fasshened garments /
and deuyllysshe shoon and slyppers of Frensmen. powches and painted gyrdels of
Spaynardes / new found hattes of Romans. And so is fulfilled the words of
our lord written in holy scripture (Jeremy.xio. Elongaueru^t a me and
ambulaueru^t post vanitate^ et vani facti sunt) This youth says our lord
has far put himself fro me / and they have walked after their own vanytees
/ and by their Inuencyons they ben all vain and undoubted. This alterable
vanytees in garments is a true argument and a faithful conclusyon to all wise
strangers That Englysshmen be as chau^gable in their manners and wits as they
be in outward garments. And if this vain marchau^dyse were oonly in youth of
the reame it were more tolerable / but (inueterati dieru^ malorum) Boys of
fyfty year of age are as new fangled as any young men be. The which by reason
should torn their face from ye world considering the end of their life. But
little yt is considered / ye rather in their vanytees the ben praised (Quonia^
laudatur peccator in desiderns ai^e sue et iniquis benedicetur. Psalmo etc. And
the third day is called Ydus / the which is as much to say as (diuisio) a
departing. By whom I understand the latter age of man / in the which man is
dyuyded from the world by death to the end for to receive good or evil as he
has deserved in this present life. Like wise then as in the first part of
the month there is but one day that is called Kalende / the which is the
first day of all. But in the later end there be many days that been named of
the word Kalendas. So in co^paryson of the first day of thy life / that is to
say of thy childehode in the which thou were well dysposed in devotion /
Multeplye thy good life and holy dysposycyon in thy latter days / that you may
deserve our lords mercy / saying with the prophet in the sawter / (Et
senectus mea in misericordia vberi) And how be it thou have often before in thy
young age and myddell age dyuyded thy life. Sometime to virtue / sometime to vice.
Ye as now in thy latter age keep thy life holy in virtue. Dyuyde it no more till
death dyuyde it after the cou^seylles of the gospelles (Ioh^es xix. Non
scindamus eam sed sorciamur de ea cuius sit) Let us not cut it / but let us
draw lottes whoos it shall be. How be it this text after the letter is
understand of Crystys cote without (...). Yet conuenyently it may be
understand of every man's life or soul (Tunica dicitur quasi tua vnica)
Whether is more surer thine own than thy soul / for the which prays ye
prophet saying (Erue a framea deus alam mea^. et de manu canis vnica^ mea^)
And while it is so that man lives here in two lives / and living after ye
pleasur of the world / the the other living here in virtue by grace to come to
bliss / tho that wol give one party of their life to vices / and an other to
virtue / and specially in their age. These manner of men dyuyde their cote And
they another all the tayllers in ye world shall never make it hole again. For as
saint Ierom says in a pystle (Difficile ymmo impossible est vt q^s in p^senti
et in futuro fruatur gaudijs vt hic ventre^ et ibi mente^. et de deliciis
transiat) It is hard ye it is Impossyble that a man may have all Joy in this
world and also in heaven / here to fylle his body and there to fylle his mind.
For truly the delytes of this world and the Joys of heaven can never be
together in one cote of thy soul. Wherefore if thy cote of thy soul be ones
hoole in virtue without any seem of vice / depart it never but let it return
(in sorte^dm^) And continue thy life in goodness without any Interrupcyon. And
like wise as in thy childehode thou begannest virtue oonly / where through in
that age thou prayseste almighty god / so in thy myddel age all wanton vanytees
laid a part encresse thy virtue / as tho did of whom it is written (Ibu^t de
virtute in virute^ quousque vedeatur deus) And that the end may be conformable
to his pryncyple without dyuysyon following the ways of Innocence with these
holy Innocents. In whoos co^mendaco^ns syngeth our mother holy church (Nouit
dn^s via^ innocentu^ qui non steteru^t in vijs pcco^rum) And if we be in sin
to repare ourselfe to the state of grace without will to fall again. And in
recognysau^ce of this gracyous benefyte of remyssyon we may louyngly praise god
as I exhorted you before saying (Laudate pueri dominu^) grant us all Christ
Ihesus (splendour patris corona Innocenciu^)

AMEN
