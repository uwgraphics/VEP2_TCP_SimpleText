Vice for to eshewe, and all abomination
Ipocr^^ie, Idolatry, which is man's perdition
O Lord is not the merits of thy passion
A sure seal of fre pardone, and remyssion?
That once was shed for man's redemption?
Upon the cross was offered, that high oblacion.
O Lord thou dyddest thy fathers wrath pacify
^Obedient thou wast unto a shameful death
For man's life, thou suffredest patiently
Thou yeldest the ghost, as the scripture says
And rose from death, to life the third day
And sit in heaven, with great power and majesty
Coequall with the father, this is no hay
Making intercession, for us sinners perpetuallye.
O Lord how long shall we weep and cry
For fault of food, to the soul spiritual
Thy watchmen are dome, and lie in their stye
Their filthy living it so abhomynable
To feed thy flock, they take no care nor pain
To teach or preach, thy fathful testament
O Lord thy word is our sure touch stone.
That leads mankind, to his salvation
Vice for to eshewe, and all abomination
Ipocrysie, Idolatry, which is man's perdition
O Lord is not the merits of thy passion
A sure seal of fre pardone, and remyssion
That once was shed for man's redemption?
Upon the cross was offered, that high oblacion.
O Lord thou dyddest thy fathers wrath pacify
^ Obedient thou wast unto a shameful death
For man's life, thou suffredest patiently
Thou yeldest the ghost, as the scripture says
And rose from death, to life the third day
And sit in heaven, with great power and majesty
Coequall with the father, this is no nay
Making intercession, for us sinners perpetuallye.
O Lord how long shall we weep and cry
For fault of food, to the soul spiritual
Thy watchmen are dome, and lie in their stye

whyppet you prestes and turn you
Vice and sin they will not rebuke
Nor come to gods word to warm you
Where do you see more Idelnes used
whippet you priests and turn you
Then among you priests which should be refused
And come to gods word to warm you
Yet they have an other pretty cast
whippet you prestes, and turn you
Which they play at the last
Leave that you priests I warn you
For than they do hold up a cup
whippet you prestes, and turn you
And all the drink they them selves drink up
Leave that you prestes I warn you
Moreover, they teach their god to play
Whyppet you prestes and turn you
This way and that way
Leave that you prestes I warn you
Now therefore I will with it be plain
Whippet you prestes and turn you
They will not stycke to break their god in twain
