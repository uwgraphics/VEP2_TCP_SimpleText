Here follows the copye of a lettre which maistre Alayn Charetier wrote to
his brother / which desired to come dwell in Court / in which he reherseth
many myseryes and wretchydnesses therein used / For taduyse him not to enter in
to it / lest he after repent / like as hier after follow / and late
translated out of frensshe in to english / which Copye was delivered to me
by a noble and virtuous Earl / At whose Instance and request I have reduced it
in to Englyssh

Right welbelouyd brother and person Eloquent / thou admonestest and exhortest
me to prepare and make ready place and entree for the unto the life Curiall /
which thou desire / And that by my help and request thou myghtest have
therein office / And herto thou art duly meuyd by common error of the people /
which repute thonours mondayne and pompes of the^ of the court / to be
things more blessed and happy than other / or to the end that I Judge not well of
thy desire / Thou wenest parauenture / that they that wait on offices / ben in
virtuous occupacions and reputest them the more worthy for to have rewards and
merits / And also thou adioustest other causes that meue the thereto / by
thexample of me / that empesshe my selue for to serve in the court Ryall / And
to the end that thou myghtest use thy days in taking company with me / and
that we might to gidre enjoy the swettenes of frendshyppe / which long time
has been between us tweyne / And this know I well / that thy courage is not
with drawn fer from my frendshyppe / And the grace of humanyte is not dreyed
up in the / which compryseth his friends as present And leueth not at need to
counseylle and aid them absente to his power / And I trow that thyn absence
is not less grievous to me / than mine is to thy self / For me seems that thou
being absente I am there where the places and affairs desioyne us / But by
cause god of fortune has so departed our destynee / that thou awaytest freely
on thyn own pryuate things / And that I am occupied on things publycque and
seruyses in sorrowful passions / that when I have on my self compassion / Then
am I enjoyed of thyn ease / and take great playsir / in this that you auoydest
the myserries that I suffer every day / And if I blame or accuse fortune for me
/ I preyse and thank her on that other part for the / For so much as she
has exempte the fro the anguysshes that I suffer in the court / And that she
has not made us both meschaunte /

Thou desire as thou say to be in the court with me / And I coueyte yet
more to be pryuely and syngulerly with the / And also for me thou would
gladly leave thy frau^chyse and pryuate life / I ought more gladly for the love
of the leave this scruptude mortell / For as much as love acquyteth him letter
in humble tranqullyte than in orguyllous myserye / late hit suffyse to the and
to me / that one of us tweyne be Infortunat / And that by my meschaunte life
thou may see and know more certainly that one and that other fortune / But
what demaundest thou / Thou sechest the way to lose thy self / by thexample of
me / And wylt lepe fro the haven of sewerte / for to drown thy self in the sea
of peril and myserye / Repentest thou the to have lyberte / Art thou annoyed to
live in peace / humayne nature has suffered such unhappiness / that she
appetyteth and desires to have that thing / which she has not / Thus
mesprysest thou the peace of thy courage / and the sure estate of thy thought /
And by therrour of mesprysement which thou have gotten / the things which of
their own condition ben more to be mesprised / than they that been shewde by
the life of another / I meruaylle me much / how thou that art prudent and wise
of goods / art so over seen and fro thy self for to dar expose thy self to so
many perillis And if thou wylt use my counseyl / Take none example by me for to
poursewe the courts / Ne the publycque murmures of hye palaysis / But alleway
late my peril be example to the for to fle and eschew them / For I dar not
afferme / that emonge the bruyt of them that torn / be any thing steadfast ne
holsom^e / Thou shall wene and hope to find / exercite of virtue / in myserye
thus common and publycque / And so certainly shall thou find / if thou make
thy view to fight co^stau^tly against all vices / But be ware and make good
watch that thou be not the first that shall be overcome / For I say the / that
the courts of hye princes be never disgarnysshed of people deceyuyng by fair
langage / or feryng by menaces / or stryuyng by envy / or corrupt by force of
yeftes / or blandysshyng by flaterers / or accusyng of trespaces / or
enpesshyng and lettyng in som^e manner wise / the good will of true men For our
pour humanyte is lightly enclyned to ensiewe and fololowe the manners and
condycions of other / And to do as they do And uneath may he escape that is
asseged and assaylled of so many adversaries / Now late us grant that thou
would persevere in virtue / And that thou sholdest escape the vycyous and the
corrupcion of such vycyous persons / yet in this caas thou had
vaynquysshed none but thy self / But this had been better that thou had don
it in thy own secret pryue place And be thou certain that for thy virtue thou
shall be mocqued and for thy truth thou shall be hated / or that thy
dyscrecion shall cause the to be suspecte / For there is nothing more suspecte to
evil people / than them whom they know to be wise and true /

The rest then is this / that thou shall have labor without fruit, / And
shall use thy life in peril / And shall get many enuyous at the / And if thou
strive at their envy / or that thou take vengeance / I tell to the that thy
vengement shall engendre to the more grievous aduersytees than thou had
tofore / And by the contrary / they that conne dyssymyle ben preysed and use
better their time in courts than the other people / The abuses of the court /
And the manner of the people curyall or courtly ben such that a man is never
suffered tenhaunce him self / but if he be corrumpable / For virtue which is in
so many manners enuyed / if she be not proud / she is mesprysed / if she bow
not / she is by force set abacke / if she be broken or hurt she is by force
hunted away / who is he then that may keep him that he be not corrupt or
coromped / or who is he that shall escape without having harm / Such be the
works of the court that they that be simple ben mesprysed / the virtuous
enuyed / And the proud arrogaunts in mortel peryllis / And if thou be set
down and put aback under the other courtyours / Thou shall be enuyous of their
power / if thou be in mean estate / of which thou have not suffysaunce / thou
shall strive for to mount and rise hyer / And if thou may come unto the hye
secrets which ben strongly for to doubt and dread / in the doubtous
courteynes of the most hye princes / Then shall thou be most meschaunt / Of
somoche as thou wenest to be most ewrous and happy / so much more shall thou
be in great peril to fall / like to him that is mounted in to the most hye
place / For to the^ whom fortune the variable has most hyely lift up / and
enhaunsed / rests no more but for to fall fro so hye down / by cause she
owes to them nothing but ruin / if thou haste take of her all that thou
myghtest / and that she would give / then art thou debytour of thy self / To
the end that she render and yield him meschaunt whom she had enhaunsed / And
that she mocque him of his meschef whom she had made blind of vayn glory of
his enhaunsyng / For the great wyndes that blow in hye courts ben of such
condition / that they only that been highest enhaunsed / ben after their
despoyntement / as a spectacle of envy / of detraction / or of hate unto all
people / and find them self subgettes till they be shamed and put down among the
people / And that they / that to fore poursiewed to them and flatered / Report
of them more gretter blames and dyuysions than the other / For multytud of
people mespryse always them / that fortune has most aualed and thrown down /
And also is enuyous of them that she sees enhaunsed and lift up / Fortune
gladly has set his eyes on hem that been in hye degree and on the soueraynes
yet more / And when she pleyeth with small and pour folks / that is no
certain / for of the meschief of pour people she retcheth not / ne does but
smyle / But she lawgheth with full mouth and smyteth her paulmes to gydre when
she sees great lords fall in to meschyef / she retcheth but / little for
tessaye and preue her fortune in lytyl and low places / But for to make the
great and mighty to fall and overthrow she sets gladly her gynnes / And
them that been pour and cast down makes she of times to rise and mount fro
certaynte to Incertaynte and fro good rewle to evil rewle / Them deceyueth she
gladly / whom she fyndeth esy to deceive / and variable as she is / But she
does the custommes and strength to them that sets by her And when she sees
her despised and naught set by / then she loves them in peace / But she
flateryth and lawgheth for naught unto them that have hye and hole courage /
Now she essayeth to Just against them that been most strong / And now she
enhaunseth the^ that been most feeble / now she lawheth to one / and she grymmeth
to other / But the man that has great courage and virtuous mespriseth her
lawhynges and mowes / And nothing doubts her menaces / But the court makes
over much compte of this fortune / that draws the people lightly to her /
forgetyng their pour estate / And forgetyng and not knowing them self as soon as they ben enhaunsed / which the wise men do not / which for none
auauncement ne having of good enpayre not them self / There assaye thou for to
mount / if thou wylt leave thy lyberte and franchyse / Then ought thou to
know / that thou shall have habundaunce thy self / when thou shall will to
poursewe the court / which makes a man to leave his propre manners / And to
apply him self to the manners of other For if he be verytable / men shall hold
him at scole of fayntyse / if he love honest life / men shall teache him to lead
dyshonest life / if he be pacyent / and set by no prouffyt / he shall be left
to have suffraunce / For if he can naught / men shall demand him nothing / And
also he shall find none / that shall give him any thing / if he enter
Inportunatly / They that be Inportune shall put him abacke / if he be acustomed
to ete soberly / and at a certain hour / he shall dyne late and shall soupe in
such faco^n that he shall dysacusto^me his time and his manner of living / If he
have be acustomed to read and study in books / he shall muse ydelly alday in
awaytyng that men shall open the door to him of the chamber or wythdraught of
the prince / if he love the rest of his body he shall be ennoyed now here / now
there / as a courrour or renner perpetuell / if he will erly goo to his bed
and Rise late at his playsir he shall faylle thereof / For he shall wake long and
late / and rise right erly / and that often he shall lose the night without
slepyng / if he study for to find frendshyp / he shall never conne trotte so
much through the halles of the great lords that he shall find her / but she
holds her without and enters not with any / For she is much better known
by them that vsen her which ben expert of reffuse / thrown down by fortune /
than by them that enter ygnoraunt / and not known her tornes / Now behold
then / and see which of the two thou shall chese / or that in my yssuyng and
going out / I draw the to our comune prouffyt or in thyn entryng thou bring
me to our comune dommage and hurt / And forgete not that who serves in the
court / Always him behooves to be a gheste / and herberowed in another man's
hows / And also he must ete after thappetyte of other / and otherwhyle
without hungre and fayn he may / And in like wise he must wake otherwhyle
at the will of other / after that he has begone to sleep and by great
gryef what thing is more domageus than to set under fortune the virtues of
nature / and the ryghtes and droytes of life humayne / seen that it is a thing
more free in a man / than to live naturelly among us servants of court / we
do nothing but live after thordonance of other / And thou lyuest in thyn house
like an Emperor / thou regnest as a king paysyble / under the couuerte of thyn
house / And we tremble for dread to dysplayse the lords of hye houses / Thou
may ete when thou have hungre / at thyn hour and at thy playsir / And we ete
so gredyly and gloutounously that otherwhyle we cast it up again and make
vomytes / Thou passest the night in slepyng as long as it playseth the / And
we after ouermoche drynkyng of wynes and great pains lie down often in beds
full of vermyne / and sometime with stryf and debate / Return brother /
Return to thy self / And learn to know the felicite / by the myseryes that we
suffer / But noman preyseth enough the ayses that he has in his pryuate and
propre house / but he that tofore mespryseth thanguysshes that he has suffered
in admynystracion publycque / Arystotle the phylosophre gloryfyed in him self /
that he had left the hye palace of king Alysaundre / And had lever to leave
there his discyple Calistenes / than there longer to dwell / Dyogenes also
which in his time above all other men louyd lyberte and fraunchyse Refused
the great rychesses and wordly Joys to which he was called / he fled them
for to enhabyte and dwell freely within the town / wherein he slepte / And also
durst somoche auau^te him / that he was more puyssaunt prince in that he might
more reffuse of goods than the said Alysaundre has power to give him For the
very phylosophre / that can well mespryse thambycious vanyte of the people of
the court / techeth to his counseyllours / that there is more of humanyte in
small things and eases / than in the courts of princes / And the benes of
Pictagoras / And the wortes that Orace ete / rendrid and gafe better savor /
than that Sardanapalus fond in the great and delycious wynes Aromatyques that
he drank / for as much as the delyces were meddled with the galle of poison /
Feures / and anguysshes mondaynes / that he had always upon his heart / not only
our life / but thexaction of our life / his tormentis adioyne to our life in such
wise that she ne has glory mondayne / ne pomp caduque without aduersyte /
Oftymes the people make great wondrynges of the Rich robe of the courtyour /
but they know not by what labor ne by what dyffyculte he has gotten it / The
people otherwhyle honors and worshypeth the great apparaylle of a puyssant
man But they acompte not the pryckkyng that he has felt in the pourchassyng
of it / Ne the greuys that he has gotten in showing of yt / Othertymes behold
the people thordynaunces and great household of the hye and great lords / but
they know not of what dyspence they ben charged for to nourysshe them / Ne
consydre nothing the title / of which they know certainly / that they have in
them no merits / If we call an hare / a lion / or say that a fair maid is
foul / or a foul / crokebacked / haltyng / or evil shapen to be as fair as
Helayne / that should be a great lesynge / and worthy of derysion / And allewaye
emonge us couetyours enfayned / we falowe more the names of thoffyces / than
the droytes and ryghtes / we be verbal / or full of words / and desire more the
words than the things / And in this we ben contrary to the wise Cathon /
Which desired more to excersise him self virtuously in comune office and
publycque / than to have the name / And in such wise governs he him self /
that when he was called / he was allewaye found worthy to have better than he
was called to / And somoche more was he honowred / as when he fled most the
worldly honors / But by the contrary we coueyte to be honowred / how well that
we ben not worthy / And so take the honors as by force and strength / er we
ben called thereto And hereof follows that we lose by good right / that which
we Judge to our self and that we dar demand indewly / And to say truth the
honors flee fro us / which we poursewe over folyly /

Therefore brother I counseylle the / that thou delight the / in thy self / of
thy virtue / For she yeldeth Joy and preysynge to them that live well / late
thy great suffysaunce reteyne the within thy lytyl Cenacle / And repute not thy
self virtuous by heryng say as done men of the court / But do pain to be
verytable by theffecte of the work / whereto coueytest thou the gloryes of
palayses which for their wretched myserye have need that men have pity on them
/ Ne poursewe it not in fayt / But by the playnt of mine unhappiness / follow not
me / by cause I am oftymes cladde with the best / But have pity and compassion
of the peryls / of which I am asseged / and of thassaultes of which I am
enuyronned night and day / For I have need to behold on what foot that every
man comes to me / And to note and mark the paas and the peril of every word
that departs fro my mouth to the end that by my vtteraunce I be not surprysed
/ and that in spekyng vnpourueydly I ne give matter to any man to make false
relacion / ne to interpret evil my word / which I may never revoke ne put
in again / For the court is the nourysshe of people / which by fraud and
franchyse / study for to draw from one and other such words / by which
they may persecute them / by that / which by the perils of other / they may
entie in to the grace of them that have auctoryte to help / or to annoye / And
which take more playsyr in false reports / than in verytable and true words
/ if thou have office in court / make the ready to fight / For if thou have
any good / other shall desire to take it fro the / and thou shall not escape
without debate / Som^e shall machyne by som^e moyen to deceive the / And the
behooves to tormente thy self to resist him / And after when thou shall have
enployed thy body / thy time and thy goods for to deffende the / Another new
one comes to the court and shall suppla^te thy benediction / And shall take it
gylefully fro the / Thus shall thou lose with great sorrow / that which thou
haste gotten with great labor / Or if thyn office abide with the / so shall thou
not abide long without dread and fere of him or of other enuyous which shall
labor to take it fro the / Tofore that thou have any offices thou boughtest
peace and moderacion to live / And as soon as thou shall have it / thou shall be
deffyed of an other / which shall enforce him for to give largely for to take it
fro the And the behooves maulgre thy self / that thou give as much as he / to
the end that thou keep it / And that it abide with the / Behold then brother
behold / how much thy lytyl house gives the liberte and franchyse / And
thank it that it has receyuyd the as only lord / And after that thy door is
shette and closed there enters none other but such as pleseth the / Men knock
oftymes at yates of rich and hye palayses / There is alleway noise and
murmr / In great places ben great and much peples / of which som^e ben
hard pressyd / The halle of a great prince is comunely Infecte and eschaufed
of the breeth of the people / The vssher smyteth with his Rod upon the heedes
of them that been there / Som^e enter by forse of threstyng / And other strive
for to resyste / Som^e time a pour man meschau^t that has to fore be sore
set abacke is further set forth than an other / And the most fyers and
proud whom a man durst not tofore touch / is put further aback and is in
more gretter danger / There knows noman in certain if his astate be sure or
not / But who someuer it be always he is in doubt of his fortune / And when
thou wenest to be most in grace / Then remember the of the poet that says /
that it is no great preysynge / for to have been in the grace of a great prince
/ And to the end that thou may the better know now the court / I will
dyscryue and dyffyne it to the /

The court to the end that thou understand it / is a couente of people that
under fayntyse of Common well assemble hem to gydre for to deceive each other /
For there be not many of them but that they selle bye / or eschange sometime
their rentes or propre vestementis / For emonge us of the court / we be
meschaunt and newfangle / that we bye the other people / And som^tyme for their
money we selle to them our humanyte precious / we bye other / And other bye us
/ But we can much better selle our self to them that have to do with us / how
much then may thou get / that it be certain / or what sewrte / that it be
without doubt and without peril / will thou goo to the court for to selle or
lose / the goodness of virtues which thou haste gotten without the court / I
say to the when thou enforcest the to enter / then begynnest thou to lose
the seygnorye of thy self / And thou shall no more enjoy the droytes and
ryghtes of thy franchyse and liberte / Certes brother thou demandest that /
which thou ought to deffye / And fyxest thyn hope in that / that shall draw
the to peril and perdicion / And if thou come / the court shall serve the with
so many contryued lesynges on that one part / And on that other side she shall
delyuere to the so many cures and charges / that thou shall have within thy
self contynuell bataylle / thought / and anguysshes / And for certain a man man
not well say / that he is well happy / that in time of tempeste is bought and in
so many contrarytees assayeed and proved /

And if thou demandest / what is the life of them of the court I answer the
brother / that it is a pour richesse / An habundance miserable / an hyenesse
that falls / An estate not stable / A sewrte tremblyng / And an evil life /
And also it may be called of them that been amorouse a deserte lyberte / Flee ye
men flee and hold and keep you far fro such an assemblee / if ye will live
well and surely / and as people well assured upon the Ryuage / behold us drown
by our own agreement / And mespryse our blyndenes / that may ne will know
our propre meschyef / For like as the folysshe maronners / which sometime cause
them self to be drowned / by their dyspourueyed aduysement / In like wise the
court draws to him and deceyueth the simple men / and makes them to desire
and coueyte it / like as a Rybaulde or a common womman well arrayed / by her
lawhyng and by her kissing / The court takes meryly them that comen thereto /
in vsyng to them false promesses / The court lawheth at beginning on them
that enter / And after she grymmeth on them / And sometime byteth them right
aygrely / The court reteyneth the caytyuys which can not absente and keep
them fro thene / and alday adnewe auctoryse and lorshippe upon such as they
surmounte / The court also by error forgeteth often them that best seren /
And dyspende folyly her propre good for tenryche them that been not worthy / and
that have right evil deseruyd it / And the man is unhappy that is taken in /
and had lever to perysshe / than to issue and goo out / And there to lose his
course of nature / without ever to have his franchyse and lyberte until his death
/ Believe surely brother and doubt nothing that thou excersysest right good
and right prouffytable office if thou can well use thy maystryse that thou
have in thy lytyl house / and thou art and shall be puyssaunt as long as thou
have and shall have of thy self suffysaunce / For who that has a small howshold
and little meyne and governs them wisely and in pras / he is a lord / And
somoche more is he ewrous and happy as he more freely maynteneth it / As there is
nothing so precious under heaven / as for to be of sufficient comynycacion with
franchyse / O fortuned men / O blessed famyllye where as is honest pouerte
that is content with reason without etyng the fruytes of other men's labor / O
well happy house in which is virtue without fraud ne barat / and which is
honestly governed in the dread of god and good moderacion of life / There enter
no sins / There is a true and ryghtful life / where as is remorse of every
sin and where is no noise / murmr ne envy / of such life enjoys nature /
and in small eases lives she long / and lytyl and lytyl she comes to
playsaunt age and honest end / For as seyth Seneke in his tragedyes / Age
comes to late to people of small howses / which live in suffysaunce / But
among us courtyours that be servants to fortune / we live disordynatly / we
wexen old more by force of charges than by the nombre of years / And by
defaulte of well living we ben weary of the swetenes of our life / which so much
we desire and haste to goo to the death the which we somoche dread and doubt /
Suffyse the then brother to live in peace on thy party / and learn to content
the by our meschiefs / Ne mesprise not thy self so much / that thou take the
death / for the life / Ne leave not the goods that thou shall be constrained to
bring / For to seche to get them after with great wayllynges and sorrow /
which shall be to the horrible and hard to find / Fynably I pray the /
counseylle and warn the / that if thou have taken any holy and honest life /
that thou will not goo and lose it / And that thou take away that thought And
despise all thy will for to come to court / And be content to wythdrawe the
within thenclose of thy pryue house / And if thou have not in time passed known
that thou have ben ewrous And happy / then learn now to know it fro hens
forth / And to god I comande the by this writing which give the his grace /

Amen
Thus ends the Curial made by maystre Alain Charretier Translated thus in
Englyssh by Wylliam Caxton
There ne is dangyer / but of a vylayn
Ne pride / but of a pour man enryched
Ne so sure a way / as is the plain
Ne socour / but of a true friend
Ne despayr / but of Ialousye
Ne hye courage / but of one Amorouse
Ne pestilence / but in great seygnorye
Ne chyere / but of a man Joyous
Ne seruyse / like to the king souerayn
Ne foul name / but of a man shamed
Ne mete / but when a man has hungre
Ne entrepryse / but of a man hardy
Ne pouerte / like unto maladye
Ne to haunte / but the good and wise
Ne house / but if it be well garnysshed
Ne chyere / but of a man Joyous
Ne there is no rychesshe / but in health
Ne love / so good as mercy
Ne than the death / nothing more certain
Ne none better chastysed / than of him self
Ne tresour / like unto wysedom
Ne anguysshe / but of ay heart coueytous
Ne puyssaunce / but there men have envy
Ne chyere / but of a man Joyous
What will ye that I say
There is no speech / but it be curtoys
Ne preysyng of men / but after their life
Ne chyer but of a man Joyous
