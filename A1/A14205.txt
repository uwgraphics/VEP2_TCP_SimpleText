A New Anatomy.

Wherein the Body of man is very fit and aptly (two ways) compared: 1 To a
Household. 2 To a City.


With diverse necessary approved Medicines, no commonly practiced heretofore:
witty, and pleasant to be read, and profitable to be regarded.

A Man, a Household, and City large,
All three in one, described you may see:
The Order, Ride, the Government, and Charge,
Of each of the^^ in each point do agree.
In Man, a Soul endued with Grace, should be,
A Household does a Man of Wisdom crave,
Good Magistrates a City ^ke should have.

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL SIR ARTHVR HEVENINGHAM Knight, one of his Majesty's
Justices of the Peace and Little, within his Highness Counties of Suffolk and
Norfolk.
ALthough I do see it by experience (Right Worshipful) that it has always
been, and yet is the manner and custom of those which endeavor to publish
their works and devises, (whether they be slight or serious; pleasant or
profitable,) to make choice of some worthy person to whom they might dedicate
and commend them; and under whose countenance they may be protected from the
carping tongues of malicious detractours: Yet have I just cause to doubt,
whether it would stand with your Worships good liking, to be made Patron of
this so simple and unpolished a Pamphlet, considering I am but a stranger, and
not known to your Worship by any kind of acquaintance or conversation.
Notwithstanding, seeing the Book it self does carry with it a device of some
Novelty, and matter of variety: wherein, had there been used any kind of
learned skill in the penning, might (pe^^aps) have bred some pleasure in the
reading: Yet such as it is, I have presumed upon the report both of your
virtuous and godly disposition, and singular elemencie; and also of your zealous
care in the administration of Justice, and abolishing of diverse Abuses, which
seek to shrowde themselves in those, and such like places, where your Worship
(by reason of your place and calling) have to deal in: I have, I say, presumed
to present it unto your wise and grave consideration. And though your wisdom
and worthiness deserves to be presented with a gift, far more excellent
then my little learning can any way afford; yet my hope is, your Worship will
rather esteem the intent, and goodwill of the giver, then the baseness of the
gift: and more regard the matter, then the manner of the handling thereof; not
doubting but that this shall seem to men of good judgment, more worthy the
Printers travel, and the Readers pains, then many vain Pamphlets of Songs,
and dallying devises, tending to the artificial cloaking of Vice, and nuslyng
of amorous heads therein. Therefore, craving your Worships favorable
acceptance hereof, and pardon for this my bold attempt; fearing to be
tedious, I humbly take my leave.

Your Worships always most humbly to command, To. Underwood.

A NEW ANATOMY, OR, A description of the whole Body of man, after an unwonted
manner: No less pleasant to the Reader, then profitable to the Regarder.
LAte in the night, not long ago
as I lay in my bed,
Musing alone of many things,
which then came in my head:
Were it by Revelation,
by Vision, or by Dream:
Or yet as lying in a trance,
or by some other mean,
I knew not well: but yet me thought,
as it were suddenly,
One caught me up into the Air,
from whence I did discrie
A City large, of bigness such, the world

as it the World had been:
A thousand thousand Houses there, The people, or the bodies of men.

a man might well have seen:
Their fashion, stuff, and workmanship,
in all points did excel.
The order of these Houses too,
I marked very well:
These Houses they were mooueable,
and often did remove
The Soul.
To places where the Owners thought
it fit for their behoue.
Their substance was of mixed stuff,
which seemed very fair:
And was derived from the Fire,
The four Elements.
Water, Earth, and Air.
Compacted by such cunning skill,
as it has heretofore
Continued unconstant full
In Adams time.
Nine hundred years, and more.
The color of these Houses be
both fair, smoth, and white:
To see them trimly decked up,
it would a man delight:
Yet be as other Houses be,
in beauty for a time:
But when they once do come to years,
their beauty do decline:
But every House do stand alone,
builded upright and straight:
And each was equal in it self,
The Arms being stretched out. the two legs and thighs.
in breadth, in length, in height.
Two Pillars framed like an Arch,
did for foundation stand,
Whereon was builded Tower wise,
each House by cunning hand.
The Pillars and the Timber-worke, The Bones.

was framed all of Boane,
As clear as Alabaster, and
as hard as any Stoane.
No Silver, Gold, Iron, or Steel,
no Copper, Tin, or Brass,
Nor any metal, VVood or Stone,
about these Buildings was.
With Lases very strong and white, The Sinews

their Joints were tied suer:
And even so long as House did last,
these Lases would endure.
A Chimney in each House there was, The noctrils.

where out there did proceed
A vapoure very like to Smoke, The Breath.

and sometime Smoke indede. Of Tobacco.

They all had Turrets on their tops, Their heads.

and some were seen to have
Upon their Turrets tops for show,
a Plume of Feathers brave:
These Turrets being round: in them
two Windows did I see, The Eyes.

Which are so like to eyes, that I,
do think them eyes to be.
If any Houses did decay, Die.

as often times there did:
Then presently an other House,
was raised in his stead. Borne^.

So that the City was supplide The World.

though thousands did decay:
And so shall be supplied still,
until the latter day.
The Scripturees.
Often have I redd in Ancient Books,
and Ancient Fathers say,
Divines.
The matter of these Houses first,
was nothing else but Clay:
God.
Till one did by a wondrous skill,
and Wisdom, undertake
By mixing of the Ellements,
these Houses all to make:
God.
Not any one (save one alone)
in all the world can frame
These Houses, as these Houses be,
nor any like the same.
These things thus seen; thus thought I then,
If these things thus without
These Houses, be so wonderful,
and glorious; then no doubt,
Those things, the which we cannot see,
which in these Houses are,
Must needs exceed these outward things
and go beyond them far.
And as I still thus musing stood,
even then it came to pass,
One standing by, did speak to me.
I know not who it was;
And bade me look: I looked then,
and lo, I did behold
The Houses all were open, and
each did it self unfold,
That I might see all things in them,
which was a thing most rare,
To mark how things within the same,
in order placed were.
And first, the Kitchen seated was, The place from the Grains to the Midrife.

as nether most of all,
Whereby it might receive such things,
as from above did fall:
By Vessels, fitting for the same, The Bowels

which long there, did not stay.
For things that bad, and noisome were,
this Kitchen did convey
By Gutters, Holes, and Channels so, The Yard and the Fundament.

that every thing was seen
Within this Kitchen for to be
both hansome, sweet, and cleene.
And yet unto the Walls thereof, The Sides.

fast cleaving did I see,
A Matter (like I know not what) The kidneys.

encombred for to be
With filthy Gravel, Sand, and Stone, The Collicke and Stone.

which very often was
A stopping to the Cundits, that
the Water could not pass. The Urine.

With that I saw an Ancient man, Physic.

that at the gate did sit:
To whom the Maker of the house, God.

these Houses did commit
To look unto, and them to mende,
when ought was there amiss.
who then took Hawes and stamped them A Remedy for the Stone.

and then he put to this,
White Wine to soake; and with the same,
he afterward did fill
A Stillitorie, and thereof
a Water he did still:
wherewith was washed this place so noyd
with Gravel and with Sand:
And presently the place was cleared,
and cleansed out of hand.
In shape most strange and wonderful,
The Stomack^.
A Pott hunge boiling there:
Yet underneath the same was seen
no fire to appear.
The Liver.
But under it a Fountain was,
out of the which did flow,
A lickuor very like to redd
The Blood.
or Claret Wine in show:
By the Veins.
Which running into every part
of every House, did serve
To keep the House in culler, and
his beauty to preserve:
The oppilation of the Liver.
And if the course thereof were stopped,
at any time or tide,
Then for the same, the keeper did
The Physician.
a remedy provide.
And as this Pott hung boiling there,
it wonder was to see,
The multitude of sundry things,
The sundry forts of meats and drinks boiling in the Stomach at once.
within the same to be,
There flesh of Fishes, Beasts, and Fowls
and many kinds of Grain,
Fruits, herbs, and roots, of diverse sorts
within it did remain:
And sundry kinds of white-meates too:
and Grocerie great store:
And Water, Wine, and Ale, and Beer,
and many Liquors more:
And every one did differ much,
in cull our, taste, and smell:
Whose quallities and virtues, would
great cunning ask to tell.
I saw it; yet in seeing it,
I took no great deliget:
For why (more strange and wonderful
then pleasant, was the sight)
Fast cleaving to this Fountains side,
there was a little Spring, Fast to the Liver cleaves the Gaull.

Within the same there seemd to be
a moist or liquid thing:
In color like a darkish green,
and yellowish withal:
The taste thereof most bitter was,
as it were very Gaull:
And if this Spring at any time,
did chance to ouerflow,
It made the House in every part, The Body.

all yellow for to show,
As if it were with Saffron did: The yellow Iaunacrs.

so one did chance to be,
And then forthwith a remedy
the Keeper did foresee. The Phisitia^

Who Turmaricke or Cellindine,
and Saffron then did take. A remedy against the yellow Iaunders.

And so^d them both in Posset-ale,
and there withal did make
Viz. to drink.
A Water for to wash the same:
whereby he did restore,
And made the color for to be
e'uen as it was before.
All next about this Kitchen lay
The place from the Midriffe to the neck.
a large and a fair Hall,
Divided from the Kitchen with
a thin and slender wall:
The midriffe
Whose fashion, stuff, and workmanship
as I was thinking on,
And did intend to take thereof,
some better view anon:
Me thought I heard a voice, that spoke,
and said unto me, Look;
And what thou see; see that the same
thou notest in the Book.
I looked, and within this Hall
were many things to see,
That very rare and precious were,
and glorious seemd to me.
The Heart.
Amongst the rest, one thing I saw,
that did the rest surmount,
A famous (though a little thing)
a thing of great account
It was indeed; and like unto
a Throne of Majesty:
Or to a Chaier of estate
it may compared be:
The fashion of the Heart
In fashion like a Pine-aple,
in color somewhat redd,
But in the greater end thereof
a Cannopie was sprede, The fatnes thereof.

That was of color very white,
which signifies in deed,
That he that sits therein as Judge, An application of the white and red
color of the heart.

must execute with speed
True Justice: yea and Mercy both:
and that he must beware,
Maliciously not to revenge,
nor parcially to spare.
And furthermore there did I see
an hollownes in it,
And in the same a Magistrate,
appointed there to sit: A good Conscience.

Who in his office all his time,
so well him self did bear,
That all things in good order were,
whilst he did govern there.
But then (me thought) it grieved me,
to see when he was out,
A Wretch intrudes himself therein, A badde Conscience.

who plays such revel rout,
That all the good the which before
the other there had done,
Was by this wicked wight defaste
and utterly for done.
Sometime this Seat should tremble, The trembling of the heart.
which
the Keeper helped thus,
By making a Confection
De Arramatibus: A remedy for the same.

And then applying of the same
unto the Seat did cause,
The tremblinge and the shaking of
the Seat, forthwith to pause.
The Loungs or Lights.
About this royal Seat was seen,
to hang in open sight,
(As Vallance hang about a Bed)
a thing in substance light:
In color very changeable,
and soft it was to toutch;
Yet hard to tear, it was so tough?
it does not differ much
In fashion from the Vallance, and
I think it not amiss
To show the daily use thereof,
the use thereof is this.
As Bellows draws in wind to them,
and then to blow it out:
A similitude
And so does puff it to and fro,
all through a hollow spout.
The off^ict of the Lounges.
Even so do these continually,
by moving to and fro,
Hale in the cool and tender aier,
and then again it blow,
And puff it out even by a long,
The Windepipe.
and slender Pipe that streach
And runs from these Places, and
The Head.
unto the Turrets reach.
And if it chance at any time,
this Pipe be stopped: they say,
The Heart.
That then the Seat and all the house,
do presently decay.
Some say (yea some of good account) Divines and Preachers.

that perfect, good, and pure,
Those Houses framed were at fitst,
and so they did endure,
Till One did by a wicked act, Adam.

then cause them for to be
Full of such imperfections,
as now we do them see:
For many times these Houses all
have blemishes and blottes,
Impediments and crookednes,
deformityes and spots:
And many imperfections more,
which often times are done
By violence or by mischaunce,
yea often times they come,
Through lack of care of looking to,
then was it in my mind,
To help these inconveniences,
some remedy to find:
And as I then did busy me,
therein to take some pain,
One suddenly did speak to me,
and said, it was in vain
To do those things, which fitter were, The Author is here forbidden to deal
in Physic.

by others to be done,
And bad me go about the things
that erst I had begone,
With that then looking to the Hall
I did behold and see
A short and hollow Pillar plaste The Neck.

viz. The top of the Hall.
upon its topp to be:
Which oftentimes bedecked was
with Jewels, Pearls, and Ringes.
With cheines of gold, with precious stones
and many other things.
The color of this Pillar was
as white as any Milk:
So was the touching of the same,
as soft as any Silk.
The Joints.
It framed was with many Joints,
which made it apt to move,
Which way the owner of the same,
thinkt fit for his behooue.
The Windpipe.
Two long and slender Cundits do
within this Pillar go,
The threate goll.
By one of them the wind it has
his passage to and fro:
A multitude of many things,
do by the other pass,
The Stomach.
To fill the Pott which erst I saw,
whereas it boiling was.
Out off this Pipe or Cundit too,
we many times may hear
The Voice.
A very sweet and sounding noise,
so pleasant and so clear,
As that it yields to our ear
a mellodie so fit,
As all the Music in the world,
is nothing like to it.
Tpon the upper end of all
this hollow Pillar, stand
A Turret, set in such a sort, The Head.

and with such cunning hand,
As to our sight it seems to grow.
The workmanship of it,
Does differ much from all the things,
which we have told of yet.
So does the form and fashion too,
and substance of the same:
For though that He that made it, in GOD.

some roundnes did it frame:
Yet in the former front thereof, The Face.

such rarenes there is found,
As nothing in the world can, in
more majesty abound.
In Beauty from all worldly things,
it bears away the bell:
In Comelines for to behold,
all things it does excel
And if one well do view the same, The majesty of the Face described.

such gravity it bear,
As that it yields cause of love,
and matter eke of fear:
For meek, and mild, and gentle things,
fear not to it to come:
But fierce and cruel things from it
for fear away do rome.
I saw a Door, which open was, The Mouth.

whereby I might discrie
All things which in this Turret were,
in order as they lie.
And first, I saw a Mill therein, The Teeth.

which was devised so
That wind nor water, horse nor hand
did cause it for to go:
Nor any Sail did long thereto,
but yet therein it grindes
What so for man is meet to eat,
or what therein it finds.
But yet the thing it grindes withal,
it is not made of stone
As other Mills but (strange to see)
it framed is of Bone.
The place where the Brains lie.
All next above the Mill there does
a little Chamber lie.
Which Chamber over head is seelde
The Skull.
with Bone like Iuorie.
The Brain.
In it a Bed (in Pallet wise)
does lie upon the floor,
Be wrapped in a Sheet of Lawne:
The thin web which wrappeth in the Brain.
and in this Bed before,
Or in the former part thereof,
does sit a gallant wight,
The Forehead.
Lusty and young Invention,
for so his name it hight.
Invention.
But in the hinder part of it,
Memory.
an Ancient man does lie,
Who many things does bear in mind,
they call him Memory.
Betwixt these two, out of this Bed,
I saw there did arise
Wit.
A proper fleet and slender Youth:
It is his common guise,
Much company for to frequent,
and in his table talk,
To argue there of many things,
to make his Clapper walk. The Tongue

He often times with Learned men
will offer to dispute, The property of a young and green wit.

And if that they his arguments
at any time confute,
Then will he wrangle mightily,
and then a man shall hear
Both quips and taunts, yea railing words
he scarcely can forbear:
He thinks to be furnished
sufficiently with skill,
Did take in hand to guide the House,
the Clapper, and the Mill,
For in this Mill a Clapper was, The tongue.

(it is wonder for to tell)
What thing this Clapper can perform
if Miller use it well: Wit.

But if that he be negligent
in ordering of the same,
The Millar then and all the House
it brings out of frame.
I saw my self when many folk
unto this Millar came,
Who having no regard unto
His Clapper how it ran: Tongue.

Upon a little conference,
betwixt them there did raise
Some wrangling words: words breeding brawles,
The inconvenience that grow by misgouerning of the tongue.
and then did follow Frayes:
And so of Frayes came bloody Wounds
of Wounds did Slaughter spring:
Then Grief and Shame ensued thereof:
thus did the Clapper bring
All out of frame, and order too,
when unadvisedly,
The Miller did permit the same,
at large to run awry.
Now that this House some light might have
things far and near to spy,
The Eyes.
Two little Lights glaswindow-wise,
were on this Turret hie.
The eyelids
Two Casements did to each belong,
to open or shut withal,
When to the Windows any harm,
were likely for to fall:
The Eyebrows.
And each of them a Pentice has,
which over it depend,
From dust, and rain, and other harms,
those Windows to defend.
All next above those Pentices,
The Brow or Forehead.
there is an open place,
In fashion like a Table, and
not much unlike the space
That Is painted White upon a wall (...)
wherein does use to stand
A similie.
A Dial drawn with certain lines,
there made with skillful hand:
By which the hours and the course
of every day we know,
And eke the moouings of the Sun,
these daily to us show.
Even so upon this Former front, Viz. The Brow.

in open vewe there lies
A sort of Long and slender lines, The lines on the forehead.

Whereof some do devise
An Art, called Phisiognomie; A degression to the Art of Phisognomie.

whereby they boast they can
Soothsaie the chances good and ill,
which happen shall to man:
The Hiest line they attribute
unto Saturnus oulde, The line of Saturn.

Which being plain, vncrossed, (...),
and smooth; then are they bold
To say, that in their latter age,
good fortune there shall be.
But contrary, if that this line,
all crossed they do see,
All next unto the same, the line
of Jupiter does lie;
(Which signifies the middle age, The line of Jupiter.
)
to him, they do apply
The giving of good quallities,
as Honesty, and Grace,
And for to be Religious,
and for to bear a place
Of Prelate, Judge, or Magistrate;
in such things shall he gain,
Who has this line, both fortunate,
Vncrossed, smooth, and plain;
But if it crooked be, or cut,
and crossed therewithal;
Then shall he rather loose in these,
or little game he shall.
The line of Mars.
The next to this, lies Mars his line,
who gouerns (as they say)
The fiery and the furious folk,
and makes them for to play
Their prises in the blooddie wars,
where Captains some he makes,
And some seditious Soldiers prove,
and some of them he takes,
And (...) them Smithes, and Armorers;
(...) ^^^imists of some:
All Butchers, Bakers, Barbers too,
By means of Mars, do come:
The Surgeons and the Sarieants both,
yea some must Hangmen be,
If Mars be not asspected well
in their nativity:
If that this line be Long and straight,
Vncrossed smooth and plain,
Then those that use these faculties,
shall have exceeding gain:
But if it Crooked be, and cut,
and Crossed; by and by,
They Judge the owner of the same,
some violent death shall die.
The two lines of Sol and Luna.
All next to this, another line,
both Long and Slender lies,
The which the Phisiognomers
amonst them do devise,
In parceis two for to divide
the right side of the same,
They say to be the line of Soll;
and of the left they frame,
A line to Lady Luna: but,
to Soll, they say pertain First of the ^ine of Sol.

For to dispose of dignities,
of Lordships, and to gain
By honorable offices;
in Credit eke to be
With those that are great maiestrats,
the rather if they see
The line of Soll to be both smo^^^
and there withal to have
No Cut, or Crossings ouerwhart,
for else they do perceive
The influence that Soll do give
is by some ill aspect;
Of some ill Sign or Planet mard,
and brought to none effect.
The left side line for Luna lies, The line of Luna.

who does enrych all those
Which haunteth navigations;
and eke she does dispose
Of Legates, and Imbassadours,
and with Atturnies too,
With Benchers, and with travelers,
she has somewhat to do:
If that her line be fortunate,
she gives them good success;
But i^ it be unfortunate,
she benefits the less.
The Eyebrows.
Betwixt the foresaid Pentises,
two certain Lines there lies,
Which if the ends of both of them,
chance upward to arise,
And meet together in the topp,
and make an Angle there,
The line of Mercury.
Then Mercury does promise that,
he need not for to fear;
That is, the owner of that House;
for luckie shall he be,
(The rather) if an unright line
betwixt them both we see:
If Mercury be fortunate,
in a Nativity,
He causes one an Orator
or Poet, for to be:
And teaches very well to speak,
and very well to wrighte,
A Secretary eke to be,
and skillful to indite:
And good in Mathematicals,
and in Arithmaticke:
A wit and a capacity,
he causes very quick:
But being found unfortunate
in any birth, they say,
That all his Influence does work
a clean contrary way:
The longer all the lines do reach,
the smoother, and more plain,
So much the more they luckie be,
and longer life retain.
But if no Angle Cross or Line, Crosses or overthwart lines be unlucky.

(which overthwart we call)
Upon this foresaid Front appear
nor yet be seen at all,
A singular most happy luck,
or fortune then he have,
That is the owner of the House,
and shall have to his grave.
Though all the Houses there, such fronts
and places do possess,
Yet have they not all Lines alike,
but some have more or less:
For some have four, three, or two,
Yea many have but one;
But very seldom do it chance,
if any House have none:
For then upon the same (they say)
no Judgment can be given,
No more then on a Dials square, A similitude

which being smooth and even,
Does want his Lines to judge upon;
without the which we shall
Perceive no more how hours pass,
then on a painted wall.
And many other odd conceits
I saw within the same,
Which now for lack of memory,
and time, I cannot name.
Long stood I looking on these Lines,
at length me seemd to hear
A voice, that safely said to me,
thus whispering in mine ear.
The Art is vain and uncertain.
Leave off to view those vanities;
For though the Art does show
Great cunning for to be in it:
and though that God (we know)
In vain has nothing made in man,
Yet since that it is found
The chiefest rules of all this Art,
yea and his greatest ground,
Stands but on opseruations,
and on conjectures frail:
How can we censure of the same,
but that we needs must fail,
The lines of Infants, old-men, and laboring men.
Of Infants lines, and such as be
exceeding lean, or old;
No man can rightly judge upon,
as Learned men have told?
And as this voice still talked on,
I chaunst to look aside,
Where I an Ancient man all clad
in sundry colors spide;
And after we each other had
saluted, by and by
I did entreat him that he would
vouchsafe not to deny
His name, for to declare to me,
and what he did intend,
By clyming o^ these places his,
and hither to assend.
Then courteously he spoke to me,
and did this answer frame:
I called am Pampirus; Pampirus omnia expertus.
and
according to my name,
To Countries, Realms, and Nations, and
to places far and near,
Their Customs, and their Orders, for
to know, to see, and hear,
I travel: that experience
in all things I might have:
And when that I have got thereof
as much as I would crave,
I do impart the same unto
Philotimus: for why, Philotimus amans veritatem. Experience and truth ought
to go together.

As Travelers together, go
Philotimus and I:
This is the man, his voice it was
which lately you did hear:
With that a plain and comely wight,
did presently appear;
His countenance was very grave,
and ancient for to see:
But yet a clear and lively grace,
In him there seemd to be:
His name importes a lover of
things honest, good, and true:
His clothing showed no less; which was
of colors White and Blue:
And after salutations done,
the other did not stay,
But fell into his former speech,
and thus began to say.
Now for our coming to this place,
Pampirus goes forward with his speech to the Author.
you are to understand,
It was our happ of late to hear,
of one that took in hand
For to describe in every part,
the Body of a Man,
Both inwardly and outwardly,
from topp to toe: and than,
Compares it unto an House,
that has in it great store
Of needful things; well governed
by one of worth: and more,
Applies every part which in
the Body we do see,
Unto some necessary thing,
which in an House should be.
And furthermore, report does go,
(If we may credit fame)
That he that made this Symilie,
so aptly did it frame,
That it unto a Commonwealth,
compared well may be.
Much more thereof besides, we hear,
which is the cause that we
Do hither come: and for as much
as that it is a lore,
That has not yet in such a sort,
been dealt withal before,
By any man: wherefore we crave,
(if you the party be,
That deals herein) you will declare
the same in each degree.
And for a new experience
I will the same forth show.
And I too (quoth Philotimus)
think to apply it so,
As that some good and godly use
may of the same be made.
And thus, when as this ancient man
his mind hereof had said,
Upon this answer, then my self
did make him this reply. The authors reply.

Your reasons which you here allege,
I can not well deny.
Yet cause of great discouragment,
I see before my face:
For why, the Curious they will carpe,
and seek for to disgrace
The thing which now you do persuade:
thereof the setting forth,
And say that I (for want of skill)
have made it nothing worth.
And some will think me arrogant,
because I undertake
To wright hereof, and make report,
that for vain glories sake,
I do the same: whereas in deed
the Truth is otherwise. The cause why the Authar did devise this Book.

For why, the only cause for which
I did the same devise,
Was for mine only private use,
that many times thereby,
By meditating of the same,
my self might edify:
And though my pains shall not to some,
do any good at all:
Yet su^r I am that harm thereby,
shall not to any fall:
Which makes me the willinger
with you to condescend,
Hoping you will as you have said,
herein your aid me lend.
The authors application of this his former devise.
Almighty God in Paradise,
when he created man
Of Soul, and eke of Body both,
he did create him than,
With Sense he did this Soul indue,
which was celestial,
And eke with Reason for to rule
the Body there withal.
A similitude
This Body then (I say) is like,
an House, in each degree;
The Soul, the owner of the House
I do account to be;
As touching first this Body then,
I did of late declare,
A comparion
It like an House in every point:
but now I will compare
or Body.
This House unto a Common wealth
Or as a City fair:
Or like a Corporation,
consisting of a Mayer,
And many other Officers,
there needful to be had.
And Commons too: amongst the which
are people good and bad:
And therefore need of government,
such people for to guide,
And as each Town and Common wealth
Or City: has beside
Appointed places for to keep
their Courts of Common law;
Yea and their Courts of Conscience too,
to keep these men in awe
So has each House his magistrates, or Body.

and officers to serve
Yea Commons too: and places fit,
for Courts, which do deserve
Good magistrates to sit in them.
But let us first of all
Speak of the Chifest Seat which late
thou saw in the Hall. or Body. The Heart of man is the Court of good
Censcience, when Grace sits there as chief Justice. These be the ordinary
attendants upon the court of a good Conscience: Viz. Good thoughts.

The chiefest Seat in every House
it is the Heart of man
Wherein if that the Sperit of Grace
do sit as Judge, even than
The Court of Conscience very well
we may it call: but see,
These Officers upon this Court
always attendant be.
Good thoughts, and motions of the mind
and next to these proceed
Another sort of Officers.
Good words. Good de^des. Faith. L^ue. Charity. Obedience. Care to live
uprightly. Patience. Godly fear. Mercy. Hope. Thankfulness Pity.
Good words, and eke Good deeds:
Yea Faith, and Love, and Charity,
Obedience, and Care
To live upright, and Patience,
and eke a Godly Fear:
And Mercy, that most willingly
forgiueth every wrong:
And Hope, that looks for happy life,
although delays be long:
And Thankfulness, that with goodwill,
does benefits requite:
And Pity, that compasion takes
of those in ruthful plight:
Virtue. Meekenes. Innocence.
And Virtue, that does Vice abhor,
and Meekenes, eke so mild,
That loves to be as Innocent,
as any little Child.
And many such like Officers,
upon this Judge attend,
To execute his warrants, when
he does abroad them send.
And if all these do faithfully
their offices: why shall
We not of right, such officers,
Good Officers them call?
But when out of this Court (alas)
The cause why Grace fail us, is our own corruption.
this rightuous Judge is gone,
(For many times he does depart,
and leave this Court alone,
Because the Seat wherein this Judge
does use to sit, is seen
Often times to be corrupted, By original Sin.
and
defiled, and vncleene,)
Another straight usurps the roomth, When Grace does ^aile, ths Devil
prevail.

and sitting in the place,
Works all the means he can devise,
the Court for to deface:
Much like unto the Parrable,
which we in Matthew reed, A Parable.

Of one that sowed in his ground
both good and perfect Seed:
But while men slept, his Enemy
upon this Land did sow
Great store of Tares among the Wheat,
and then away did go.
So Satan, with his hellish crew,
this place does enter in,
And sitting there as Magistrate,
his Court he does begin:
About him then flocks all his train, these be companions to the court of a
bad Conscience: viz. Bride. Disdain. L^^tines. Scorn. Contempt. Ambition.
Vainglory Envy. Malice. Spite.

(like to a swarm of Bees)
Of Baylifes, and of Officers:
the names of whom be these.
Pride, and Disdain, and Loftines:
and Scorn, and eke Contempt:
Ambition, with Vainglory: which
great matters do attempt.
Then Envy, yea and Malice too,
and Spite, that peevish else,
Who sre^teth that another should
be better then himself.
Covetousness.
Then Covetousness is called for,
who like a Miser old,
Comes limping in, and in his hand
a mighty bagg of Gold.
Robbery.
And Robbery, that use to stand
hard by the hig-wayes side.
Theft.
And sneaking Theft, that in the dark
does seek him self to hide.
And those that know how for to hoord
Hoording of money.
and hide their money well,
Thinking that they the same, with them
shall carry into Hell.
Usury.
And Usury, that greedie-gutt,
that eats up the poor:
Simonie.
And Symonie, that Clergy mate,
and many others more.
Wrath.
And Wrath, with his allyances:
Murder.
and Murder, which does kill
Both friend and foe maliciously,
and with pretended ill,
Banning. Cursing.
And Banning, yea and Cursing both,
whose customs are to crave
More Plagues to light on other folks,
then they themselves would have.
Fury.
Then Fury, in his frantic mood,
came squaring into Court,
And brought with him in company
Disorder.
Disorder, and a sort
Swearing.
Of Swearing mates: that straight the Court
was brought in such a rage,
Belzabub.
That scarce could Belzabub himself
his Officers asswadge:
Yet Cruelty, for all this coil, Cruelti.

could scant be pacified,
Until that with inflamed eyes
his Lust he had espied: Lust.

For Lust does to this Court belong,
her use is to allure
Lasciuiousnes; she Wantonness: lasciuiousnes.

and Wantonness procure Wantonness.

Concupisence to come with her Concupisence

into the Court; and there
Foul Ribaldrie, her filthy talk Ribaldrie.

no whit at all does spare.
Then enters in Idolatry: Idolatry.

who is so far begone
With blinded love of Images,
that many times a Stone,
A Stock, a piece of Lead, of Brass,
of Silver, or of Gold,
He worships as his God, and does
it for his Savior hold.
Here Witchcraft came; Witchcraft. Sorcerie. Coniuration. Gluttony.
Drunkenness* Adultery. Fornication. Incest. Buggerie. Heresy. Error.
Hypocrisy.
a withered wretch
who always bears a mind
To spoil another, though it self
thereby no profit find.
And Sorcerie with Charms do use,
and poisoned Drinks likewise.
And Coniuration, causing Spirits
in Circles for to rise.
And Gluttony, that only joys
in ^ase, and belly-cheare.
And Drunkenness, that reeling goes,
with belly blown with Beer.
Adultery, which maringe bed
of Hone^tie does spoil:
And Fornication, that does chaste
Virginity defyle.
And Incest, which with kindred near
to lie, no sin it think:
And Buggerie, that beastly sin,
for which did Sodom sink:
And Heresy, that does uphold,
and stoutly does mayntaine
False errors in Religion,
and eke opinions vain.
At last comes in Hypocrisy,
who outwardly does show
A face of feigned holiness,
though deeds be nothing so.
And many other Officers
did to this Court belong,
Which for to tell them all by name,
it would be very long:
Anon unto the Court again,
the rightuous Judge did come;
But when he saw such wicked wights,
possessed in the room,
A Battle betwixt the flesh and the spirit.
He did command his Officers,
in no wise for to spare,
But thrust them out with violence,
the other side prepare
With force for to resist, and then
a Battle they did try When Grace draws me, the Devil must fly.

But yet at length the wicked ones
constrained were to fly
Much like unto the Battle which
Saint John has to us told
Which in his Revelations
he says he did behold
How Michaell and his Angels did A similitude.

a Mighty Battle fight
With Satan and his hellish impes
and put them all to flight
Lo thus (quoth I) then very well
we may behold and see
A Court of Consience in each House Or Body.

is needful for to be
As Well as in a Common Wealth;
or in a City large,
If for to rule and govern well,
we mind to take the charge.
And now the Court of Common Law, The Court of common law.

I mean for to declare
Both what it is, and where it is kept,
and who the Judges are:
what officers on it attend,
and for to show likewise,
Who are disturbers of this Court;
for many times arise
Both quarrels, and Contentions there,
by some of evil fame
For Virtue crossed is by Vice,
contrary to the same
Within the Turret of each House,
there does a Chamber lie,
Which Chamber, round about is seeld
as white as Iuory.
With in the same the Court is kept,
and in this Court does sit
The four cardinal virtues whereby we should govern alll our common affaies
described.
Four Judges, all of worthy fame,
and for the place most fiitt,
The Chief of them is Justice called,
who does uprightly hear
Both rich and poor, not ledawry
with malice, love, or fear
The second Prudence has to name,
whose wisdom does foresee,
To sound the deapth of every cause
least ought mistaken be.
Then Temperance, whose mildnes does
both moderate each thing
And drives Discord out of Court,
and does Good order bring.
The last is Fortitude, whose force
and Courage does defend,
The Iustnes of the Inocent,
and makes the stubberne bend:
The officers which to this Court.
attending I did see,
Their names be these; or such as these,
I wish them all to be.
Plaine-dealing stands in Court and shows
the title of the Cause:
And craves nothing but the right
according to the Laws,
Then Expedion, does desire
with speed an end to have,
Of all his long and teadious suit,
Expenses for to save,
And Pity pleades for Poverty,
in Forma pauperis, The right use of all those that are to be employed in any
court.

And looks for no stipend nor
for any fee for this.
Then Charity for concord calls,
persuading to agree
And wills them for to leave their suits
and friends again to be.
Content then tells his Client thus,
I hunt not after gains,
Give what you will, amodicum
shall please me for my pains.
But yet a among these officers,
do many times resort
Unto this Court a another Crew
of naughtipacks a sort,
Who by their shifts and pollices
do compass so the same,
That often they do disturb the Court,
and bring it out of frame. The Sundry abusees of many that are employed in
Courts described.

For Fraud seeks with his subtle shifts
plaine-dealing to disgrace,
And trifles much on many points
that rises in the Case,
Delaie coms dallying in with drifts
demanding further day
All though his Clyent has before
informd him what to say,
Discord.
Then Discord mooues Contentions,
and bids them go to law:
Why put you up of wrong (says he)
the value of a straw*
Affection.
Asection thus unto his friend
in secret sort does tell,
Let me alone what ere it be,
your matter shall go well
Fear.
Your adversary (then says Fear)
he is a man of might
Have patience, I sorry am
I may not do you right
Ambo dexter.
And Dexter, deals deceitfully
of Ambo, taking fees
And cares not, (so that he might gain,)
though both of them do leese,
Briberie.
And Bribery, bestirs him there,
as busy as a Be,
And thinks by giving gifts, to blind
the eyes of Equity
By Color of his office, though
Extortion.
Extortion does the wrong,
Yet says, he takes no more then to
his office does belong
And many more such busy mates
do in this Court abide
Under the Cloak of honesty,
seeking themselves to hide.
The heart.
Whom though the Judges many times
do banish out of Court,
And punish them as they deserve,
yet still they will resort:
For as they have been in this Court
time out of mind of man,
So still in Court they will be, do
the Judges what they can. Title of prescription.

Lo thus you see of keeping Court,
in every House the need.
Now of the Commons for to speak
somewhat, I will proceed:
As Commons for the greater part,
consist of men of Trade,
Artificers, and Laborers,
and such as use have made
Both apt and fit for that which should,
Society maintain. A similitude

Without the which, a Comon-wealth,
cannot it self sustain.
Even so in every Body, or
in every House, we see
Such parts and members of the same,
as may compared be
To Commons in a Cmmon-wealth: The Commons, or communaltie, and how it is
applied.

and like in each degree
For in the Body of a man,
(as I before have said)
Some part or member of the same,
can exercise the Trade
Of Brewers, and of Bakers too:
yea and some have the skill
To Barber, and to Butcher to,
Poulterers.
and Fowls likewise to kill:
So has it some that exercise,
the Sciene of Defense,
And handles can the weapon which,
often times do breed offense.
It has likewise the Soldier, which
in Wars can toss the Pike
And handle well the Musket, and
knows how with Sword to strike.
And drum and Trumpet for to sound,
The propir and sundry uses of the hand.
and eke the Horse to guide,
If that they hap at any time,
upon an Horse to ride.
The Carpenters and Coopes art:
the Cobblers craft; some can
The Ioyners trade, and some likewise
can Iuggle now and than:
For even as in a Commonwealth,
a City, or a Town,
So every idle man abuses some parts of his body to idle pastimes.
Full many idle people be,
which wander up and down:
So every House has idle mates,
which uses for to play
At Chesse, at Bows, at Dice, at Cards,
at Tennis, day by day.
And some there be, which have likewise
The use of the arms and shoulders, or the legs.
in them, a Comely grace,
Within their Arms in kindly sort,
his friends for to embrace.
And every House has Porters too,
which carry too and fro
Great Packes and burdens, when they are
commanded to do so.
It has Intelligencers, which
seek out to see and hear
What news abroad, both good and bad, The use of the eye and the ear.

and then the same they bear
Unto the owner of the House,
and him thereof does warn,
That he the better may prevent
the things that might him harm.
It has likewise his Clergy men,
that now and then can preach,
And doctrine either good or bad,
can utter forth and teach.
And Orators, that can a smooth
and learned tale forth tell.
And Lawyers too, that for it self, The use of the tongue and the voice.

can plead his causes well.
And Chapmen that cen buy and sell,
and good account can make,
Of any thing that for the House
they do receive and take.
And them likewise that can conferr
with either friend or foe,
And as occasion offered is,
can frame an answer so.
And Laborers that digg and delue, The use of the hand and the foot ioyutly.

with M^ttocke and with Spade,
And those that both with hand and foot,
do use the Weauers trade.
(...) and like the fading flower:
And to an earthen vessel, that is
in danger every hour:
For to be chrusht in pieces: and
a Dungeon some it call,
A Prisonhouse unto the Soul,
that keeps the same in thrall:
And many such like other names
the Scriptures do declare.
All which is true, if with the Soul,
we do the same compare.
For why, the Soul Gods Image is, What the Soul is.

a thing Divine: but yet,
As touching this our Body suer,
God has bestowde on it
Such admyrable workeman-shipp,
as when he did it frame,
His wisdom, power, and glory then,
was showed in the same:
So that we are therefore to laud,
and praise his holy name.
Likewise each Body of the Just,
the Scriptures term to be
The Temple of the Holy Ghost,
and that we shall it see
At latter day, for to arise
in glory for to sit
With Christ, who by his precious blood,
long since redeemed it.
Beside, the ordering of the same,
and government of it,
Even from the state of Commonwealths,
do differ not a whit.
And why? because all Commonwealths
do of our Bodies come,
And when our Bodies cease to be,
then Commonwealths are done.
And as a Realm, a Commonwealth,
a City, or a Town,
Cannot continue long, but is
in state of falling down,
If that the Common People, which
within them do remain,
Do not together join as one,
their state for to maintain.
And as an House must needs decay,
and all that long there to,
If those that dwell therein neglect
the things that they should do.
Even so it with our Bodies stands:
for if it so befall
The Eye, the Ear, the Hand, the Foot,
the parts and members all,
Join not together all as one,
the Body to sustain,
we see by daily proof, the Body
cannot long remain.
And even as in a Commonwealth,
a City, or a Town,
There ought to be good Magistrates,
to keep the wicked down.
And as in every House there ought
a Governor to be
Amongst the people in the same,
good order for to see:
Even so in every Body; in
the which a Soul do dwell,
Most needful it is some one to have, A good Conscience,

the which may govern well:
Or eke the Realm; the Commonwealth;
the City; or the Town: The general inconvenience of e^^^ government.

Yea and the Soul, and Body too,
(though things of great renown)
Cannot endure: but needs must fall
to ruin and decay,
The proof thereof by ruling ill,
too often see we may.
As Corporations, Cities, Towns,
and Villages a sort,
The better for to govern them,
have oftentimes their Court:
As well Ecclesiastical,
as of the Common Laws.
So every man within his House,
(and in him self) have cause,
To see that both these Courts be kept:
the first of them to keep,
For Causes hidden in the Heart, See more hereof in fol. 27. and 28.

and in the Conscience deep.
The other Court must houlden be,
for matters that depend
Twixt man and man, right for to do,
and wrong for to amend.
Each several Court, has several Rules
belonging thereunto,
For to in^truct their suitors all,
what every one should do.
The Gospel. The Commandments
The Gospel, and the Morrall law,
who so observes, this
I am persuaded that he shall
but seldom do amiss.
The application of the keeping of these Courts.
And for the keeping of these Courts,
we thus must understand,
That every good and faithful man,
must daily take in hand
For to examine well himself,
his thoughts, his words, and works,
And Look if any wickedness,
in any of them lurks:
And if he chance some faults to spy,
as doutles but he shall,
That then unto the Lord-chiefe-Iudge,
he faithfully do call
For pardon for his former faults:
and do as is before
Directed him: and then I think,
he need to do no more.
Thus briefly have I showed my mind:
and now, because the day
Comes on apace, and that (quoth they)
we needs must hence a way:
We leave you till another time,
when we may talk our fill.
I rather wish you would (quoth I)
abide and tarry still.
But when our leave, each one of us
did of each other take,
The sorrow I conceived thereof,
did cause me for to wake:
And when I saw my self in bed,
I rose up presently,
And went and took my pen in hand,
and Wrote down by and by
(So near as I could call to mind)
what I before had seen:
And all the talk, and conference,
which passed us between.
If any shall hereafter seem
for to mislike of this,
I crave they would vouchsaue to mende
what here they find amiss.
And here I end; wishing these things,
may be as well applide,
And to no worser end, then in
this book is specifide.
