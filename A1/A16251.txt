Prologus
To reyse a toure so high so large and long
For to this day touching the great might
Of this toure which babell men yet call
Men fro far may have thereof a sight
It surmountith other tours all
Of which work thus it is bifall
Of serpents and many a great dragon
It is no we called cheef habitacion
That noman dare as they it se
For wicked air and for corruption
By a great space and in a great cuntre
Aproche nor nere that merueylous dungeon
So venomous was that mansion
And so orrible that noman dare approach
Like to a mountayn byldyd on a roche
And as men say that had thereto repeyre
This toure atteynith unto the sterres clear
And transendeth the region of the air
The stones and the syment were made of such matter
And the ioynynge so steadfast and entier
Though fire and water both did it asseyle
But little or naught their power should avayle
It was made so mighty to endure
So well assuryd by disposicion
That in this world no living creature
Saw never none like in comparison
Whoos rerynge up was chief occasion
And the riches of the masonrie
Were through Nembrothe of pride and surquedie
Demyd proudly as in his auice
He transcendyd all other in noblesse
Thought himself most mighty and wy^e
Fellow to god as by lyknesse
But god that can all worldely pride oppress
And make princes eclypsen in their glory
Such as trust in things transitory
The same lord of his eternal might
This toure which Nembroth list to edifye
He made with thondre and levyn light
Thereof to fall a full great party
The boistous wyndes and the rage sky
And gods power on that other side
Bygan thus abate a perrell of his pride
And in discente and falling of the stonys
Of the werkmen full many a man was deed
And oppressyd their back broken and bones
The masonrye with their blood was read
Yet proud Nembrothe that of this work was head
With all thies signs his lord he list not know
For which his pomp was after brought full low
But in his error procedith forth of new
Thought he would get him self aname
Of melancoly can change look and hew
And began also to tempte and atame
For to encreas and magnify his fame
A new toure to edifye again
Like as god had been blind and nothing seen
He would have raught up to the sterrys seuyn
By thassent of them that can him first counseyle
Robbyd god and from him raught the he^yn
But who presumith the lord above tassayle
It were no reason that he should avail
Princes may well against him cry loud
But his powere may elipse with no cloud
For in the mids of his great emprises
This proud Nembroth making his masons
For to cumpas and cast their devises
Geometries in their divisions
But god that has his aspeccious
Seeing thententis of every erthly man
As he that is most mighty and best can
Against their malice make resistance
Their worldly power their dominacion
Of his vengeable and most magnificence
He can chastyce and ouir whelme down
The pride of princes in every region
By ensaumple of Nembrothe as ye shall here
Whose pomp raught above the sterres clear
For when his werkmen stood at a avantage
And most were besy to his intencion
And before that time spoke all one langage
All suddenly by transmutacion
There was of tongues made a division
That in their wyrkynge as they can obreyde
No man wist what that other said
And it is lykly according with reason
So as change was made of their langages
So of their hertys was made division
Both of their will and of their corages
And in ascendynge of their worchynge stages
There was such change of brother unto brother
Like strangers noon knew thentent of other
Mine auctour trowith that this aduersite
Was for there gilt caused by vengeance
Or else god of right and equity
Disposith has in his ordenaunce
To be among them so great a vareaunce
That through the world they should them self divide
And for Nembroth disseuer and not abide
They ganne anon among them self disdeyn
To accept this Nembroth for their king
And ^monge forsooth there was not tweyne
Don of another that had clear knowing
Neither of their spech that knew the pleyne menyng
For which the cuntre of sennaar they forsook
And e^^ of them asundry cuntre took
They ^^^^yd and made no longer space
Following the fortune of their division
And began to chief them a new dwelling place
In the pertyes of many aregion
And thus Nembroth was pryuyd and put down
And of babell the mighty famous toure
He was called no longer possessoure
For against the pride of this Nembroth
Froward fortune began her course to varye
And god also was in manner wroth
Of surquedie that he was so contrary
And for the place was wild and solitary
Of this sennaar and furious savage
Nembroth began to feeble and fall in great age
And yet su^me books of him specify
He wax froward of his condition
And was first ground of ydolatrie
And fynder up of false religion
Causynge people to have an opinion
Gods to worship in paynymes wise
Founder of rightes and of false sacrifice
Toward perce chees his dwelling place
The which cuntre is in the orient
That his lordship should stretche a great space
He boundyd him into the occident
For Perce land has his extent
Toward the parties of the read see
And this land Perce who so list to se
As bochas old remember and put in mind
How that perce costith enuyron
Septemtrion and the great ynde
And many an other mighty region
Where Nembroth had first dominacion
Which exte^dith as books specify
Out of mede into Garmanye
But in lordshippes as mine auctour says
Without that virtue be there true gyde
In them there is suraunce none ne faith
Thing that passith may no while abide
Wherefore bochas in aspyte of pride
And in rebukynge of all folks proud
Making his compleynt cries to them full loud
An exclamacion of bochas again all proud men showing how god may them and
their pride wha^ him best lift by many diverse means and ways punysshe and
chastise
yE all proud most ryall in your flowers
Which that most trust to reign long
Dressith up your roches and your toures
And against god make your self strong
And let your power proudly vnderfonge
Your self with pride for to magnifye
Against the heuyn to hold the champartye
Bildyth up your castelles reyse them up on hight
Of ademantys with iron strong ybounde
With square stonys large and huge of hight
Reyse up your walls most mighty and profound
And shyt your dungeons with mighty cheynes round
Let men of arms who euir wake or sleep
Night and day your watch so straytly keep
As god ne man in your opinions
Your fortresses might not assail
Your castelles ne your strong dungeons
Stuffyd with men and plenty of vitayle
Like to stand euir and neuir for to fa^le
As god not might ayenss your false puissaunce
When euir him list of right to do vengeance
Set before your iyen that been blind
The monst^^^ous work of great babilone
The pride of Nembrothe there was put behind
Maugre his might and his tower smy^e down
For all the craft of werkemen and mason
Distroyed was with a soden leuene
To avenge his pride sent adowne fro heuyn
For though your strengthis so assuryd be
That non engyne may thereto attain
Gunne ne br^mberd by no subtyltie
Shot of arowblast ne touch of dundayne
Yet god that is lord and sovereign
Which liche desertys can both spyll and save
May confunde with an earth quaue
Mine auctoure askyth what castle or what toure
May be so strong made in any wise
But that by mean of sum false traitoure
Or by sum way that he can devise
It may be lost or sold for couetyse
And delyueryd for all the strong bonds
Into the power of enmyes hondes
Or by sum other soden adventure
Castellys and cities and many aryche town
Have be lost they might not them assure
For to reciste against false treson
Su^me have be lost also by rebellion
And all these means the truth to begin
Is but punisshynge which god sent for sin
God has a thousand hands to chastyse
A thousand darts of punicion
A thousand bows made in diverse wise
A thousand arowblastes bent in his doungeon
Ordained echon for castigacion
But where he fyndeth meekness and repentance
Mercy is maistresse of his ordinance
Ye that been wise considers how the rote
Of vicis all is pride ye may well se
Pullith him down and puttith underfoot
And takyth your counsel of humilite
And if ye list to stand in surety
Byldeth in heart for more sekernesse
A toure of virtues groundyd on meekness
Whose masonrie is of no costage
Of virtues ground and sovereign
^lastys of wyndes and of wedres rage
Neither no tempest hasty ne sodeyne
Pomp ne blast though they do their pain
This virtue mekenes for to undermine
They be to feeble to make her to inclyne
For where meekness is groundyd verily
Though he sumtyme feel aduersite
He ^ssith ouir and suffrith pacientely
And venquisshith all manner enmite
The assaute also and the contrariosite
Of infortune and of worldly trouble
And of victory conquerith a palm double
And though mekenes amyddys the flodys flow
Of worldely myscheef and persecution
While paciens in her boat does row
Though froward wawesposse her up and down
A calm shall follow of consolacion
When stern wyndes their blastys have laid low
The name of meekness shall show and be well know
She may be trowblyd but ouirco^me neuir
And for a time she may suffer wer^e
But at the end she venquisshith euir
On land and see whedre she be nere or fe^re
To the hauyn of life she was the lode sterre
I take record of the humilite
Of mary so blyssyd moot she be
The root of mekenes flourith up so fair
Whose bewte dredith no tribulacions
In somer winter her flowers not apeyre
And her fruit lastyth in all manner scasons
Pride may asseyle with his bostful sownes
And finally for her increase of glory
With humbleness she wynnith the victory
Lenuoye
O Folks all that this tragedies read
Haueth to mekenes among your aduertence
Of proud Nembroth also takes head
How that he fill from his magnificence
Only for he by sturdy violence
List of malice the mighty lord assail
But in such case what might his pride aueyle
Noble princes which this world do possede
Ye that be famous of wisdom and science
And have so many subiettis that you dread
In governance under your excellence
Let your power with mekenes so dispense
That false pride oppres not the poreyle
Which to your nobles so much may auayel
Pride of Nembroth did the brydel led
Which him co^uayed with great insolence
Pride aperteyneth nothing to manhood
Save in armies to show his presence
Wherefore honor laud and reverence
Be to mekenes that has the gouernaile
Of all virtues which man may most avail
How many years was bitwixte Adam and Nembroth and bitwixte Nembroth and
Cadmus and of other kings
THese old poetis with their sawes swear
Full covertly in their verse do feyne
How old saturn was su^metyme king of Crete
And of custom did his besy pain
And of his goodness lift to ordain
That he should as of his nature
E^h^on devour as by his engendrure
In this matter shortly to soiorne
To understand of poetys the process
They mean plainly at this word saturn
Does in it self nothing but time express
And philosophers bear also witness
That as in time furthe every thing is brought
So time ayenwarde bri^gyth every thing to naught
Clerkys also record in their writynge
Under supporte as I dare rehearse
How that fire wastyth every thing
And iron herd does nesshe things perce
If ought abydith that they may not transuerce
Yet comith time and by continuance
And all consumith with his sherpe lance
His sharp toth of consumpcion
In s^yll wise does his besy cure
For to auentissh in conclusion
All thing that is brought forth by nature
By long abiding ye may them not asure
For old thyngys deuouryd men may se
Far out of mind as they neuir had be
Who can or may remember in any wise
The glorious prowess of these princes old
Or the noblesse of philosophers wise
Or of poetis their feynynge to unfold
Process of yerys alas as I you told
Deuouryd has their name and their noblesse
Derkyd their renoune by foryetfulnesse
Thus of their names is left no memory
Time with his rasoure has done so great vengeance
Shaven away the honor and the glory
Of many noble full mighty of puissaunce
That there is left now no remembrance
Of princes / poetys / ne philosopheres
For when that death nailed them in their cofres
Came time upon and by process of years
Their memory has duskyd and their mind
And reuolucion of the heavenly sperys
By often turnynge their glory has left behind
Thus every thing which subget is to kind
Is in this life without more advantage
Wastyd with time and process of langage
In the first time from adam to Noe
Prudente Listirs which list in bokys to read
Fond of fortune no mutabilite
Neither of her change they took tho none head
But from adam there rekened been in deed
Unto Nembroth by turnynge of the heuene
A thousand yerys vii hundryd and eleuene
In which space who that considerith well
There ben no things written in especial
Digne of memory ne speken of never adell
Which that been notable ne historiall
But for the time Nembroth had a fall
Unto cadmus the years to contene
They were a thousand / iiii hundryd / and xiiii
Touching this Cadmus as bochas list endite
It is rehercid by rethoriens
How one vixoses in books as they write
Was made first a king of the egipciens
When philosophers and nigromanciens
Byganne first to abound their renoune to auaunce
Nachor that time having the governance
Of the ebrewes as made is mention
After nembroth by true rehersaile
Three hundryd year by computacion
Four score and xii which time it is no fail
That vixoses began werres and great bateyle
Of volunte against strange nations
And to conquer cites borowes and towns
By force only without title of right
He wanne all egypt to increase his nane
But for all that who list to have a sight
There is now left no report of his fame
Save bochas writith how he first did attain
His mighty conqueste of intencion
That the glory and the high renoune
Ascryued were unto his worthiness
And the residue and surplusage
Of gold and tresoure of good and of riches
Turn should to common advantage
Of all his people that every manner age
Report might it was to him more nerre
Above singularite his common to prefer
Also thomas of cithi^ first king
When sarnek was duke and sovereign
Ouir the jews by record of wrytinge
Two hondrithe year lx also and tweyne
After Nembroth this thomas began ordeyne
A mighty power and a strong battle
Them of cithie proudly to assail
Conqueringe from thens unto the i will
Called Ponte in full cruel wise
And thought his lordshyp last not but a while
All that he wan was for couetyse
And as bochas does of this folk devise
Process of yeris for all their great puyssaunce
Has put their namys out of rememberaunce.
zorastres also for all his great might
Of bactrians king and possessour
Lord of trace and a full mighty knight
Of all his dedis and his great labor
Of his conquest ne of great honor
Is nothing left of writynge us biforne
Save that he louhg the hour that he was borne
He began full sone for to be merye
With soden laughter at his natiuite
And worthy Ninus that was king of Assirie
Expownyd his laughter to great felicite
The which Ninus wan many a fair cuntre
And day by day his power began encreas
For which he would not of his conqueste ceas
For this is the manner of these conquerours
When they have had in armies victory
They do their might their pain and their labors
With new emprisys to be put in memory
For their courage supprisyd with vein glory
Can not be still content in their estate
Till their paradie say to them chek mate
Fortune of armies in books ye nay read
With a falls laughter on folks though she shine
She frowerd euir or they can take heed
Of nature woll falsely them begyle
Conquest by werre lastyth but a while
For who by death does sturdy violence
God woll by death his vengeance recombence
This worthy ninus began mightily prevail
Against zorastres of whom I spoke tofore
For he with him faught last in batayel
In which ninus has him so well y bore
That zorastres has the field y lore
And he was auctour as books specefy
Of falls magik and nigromancy
He fond the nature of every element
Their kyndly worchynge and their mutacions
The course of sterrys and of the firmament
Their influences their disposicions
Their aspertes and their conjunctions
Wrote in pylers divised of metal
The seuyn sciences called liberal
Also in pylers of break full herd ybake
Where were up set long large and huge
He began also write them and under take
To make them sure as for their refuge
That they should by flode ne diluge
Diffacyd been as of their scripture
But in their grauynge perpetual endure
But though zorastres these craftys out fond
Full little or naught it might to him avail
And though he were a good knight of his ho^de
He was of ninus slain in battle
Lost his realm and riall appareyle
And ninus dyed within a little throw
But in what wise the story is not know
Also moydes king of sodomee
I find of him no memory by writing
Save in a story as men may read and see
He and his people were freell in lyuinge
But he that was of assiriens king
Through false fortune that can so often vary
To babilonye made them tributarie
We have seen and read also
The vengeance and the pestilence
Done in egypt to king pharo
For that he made a manner resistance
Against god of wilful negligence
Therefore his people upon a day and he
Were dreynt echon in mids of the se
The people of god led by moses
Without trouble of any manner wawe
Went echon in quyete and in peace
And phaaro as he began after draw
Them to pursue by a full mortal law
In his pu^suyte froward and ateynt
Among the wawes with his often was dreynt
In ^^ody ben the mencions
L^^iously put in remembrance
^he ^nplages and persecutions
In Egypt done by full great vengeance
And of their tresoure and their great substance
They were dispoyled / by ebrewys it is told
Of their vessels of silver and of gold
And out of egypt full great tresoure they ladde
Such as them thought might most them avail
And pharo I find that he had
Two hundryd charys enarmyd for battle
Them to pursue and proudly to assail
And fifty thousand in whom was no lack
Of men of arms following on horse back
Two hund^ryd thousand of fotmen him about
And of egypt all his cheualrye
And pharo with all his great route
^egan israel pursue of envy
But for his pride and false surquedye
He and his people were drownyd euerychon
Of all his noumbre was left not one
His froward heart against god indurate
Fulfilled of malice and obstinacye
And in his purpos proud and obstynate
These foul vices or he could them aspye
From his glory and his regaile
He was down though he tofore was crownyd
Amydde the se among his people drownyd
Of Oggigus king of Thebes
ANother Prince called Oggygus
King of Thebes as books determyne
And founder was thus Bochas tellith us
Of a cite called Eleusyne
Which stant in greece whoos power to declyne
There fill a flode in that region
Which over flowyd many a ryall town
And in athia that did most damage
Time of Jacob patriarch notable
And this deluge with his wawes rage
Slew lords many and princes honorable
For dame fortune is so disceyuable
That she sumtyme when she list disdeyne
Can folk assail with a flode sodeyne
This flode also where it did assail
Wastyd cornys both crop and rote
Caused also scarcete of vitaile
That many a man felt full vnsote
The pore not wist where to find boot
For their princes supprised were with dread
Through lack of vitayle in that great need
Of a great flode in Tessalie
ANother flode there was in Tessalie
In the time when king amphion
Held the ceptre and the regalye
Upon thebes the mighty strong town
Beside the kingdom of babiloun
The same time this flode fill doutles
When gods people was led by moses
With this flode the land had been devoured
Of tessaylie and of all that region
But on pernaso the people was socoured
And on the roches that stood enuyron
Found there refute to their salvation
And great socoure till the flode rage
Began discrece withdraw and a swage
In old stories also ye may se
When Cicraps had first possession
Of athenys the mighty strong cite
An hete there fill in that region
By influence that descendith down
From the bodies above celestial
Which likely was for to devour all
And this hete engendryd with the sun
In diverse countrees both in length and bread
Has his course so myghtely begun
That many folks fell in great dread
Ryuers wells who so list take heed
Consumyd were and dried up echon
The heart called the enbrasynge of pheton
Of goodly Isis wife to Apys king of argyne slain by his brother Dyffeus.
wE have read in stories here toforne
How that Isis to egypt took her flight
Out of Crece the true daughter borne
Of Prometheus a full manly knight
And Isis in every mannys sight
So fresshe / so goodly weddyd by her live
To worthy Apys that was king of argyue
The which Isis excellent of bewtye
After time her fader was ygraue
She was put for more suretye
With her uncle that should keep and save
This said maid that no man should her have
And her uncle in Ouyde ye may se
Like as he wrote was called Epymethe
And flowynge up in her tender age
This said Isis so plesaunt was and mete
Of semelynesse of look / and visage
That Jupiter the mighty king of Crete
Was enuyroned with her for to mete
And she excyted of femynyte
Enclynyd her heart unto his deite
And for she was of her intent so clean
Obeynge him in most lowly wise
Of argmois she made her to be queen
Because that she was smyt in couetise
Against argus a werre she ganne deuyse
And for he was unwieldy of his age
Her to withstonde he found none advantage
But yet fortune ganne upon her froune
And king argus through his subtylite
With his counseyll so prudently ganne rowne
That she was take by full great cruelte
And her soudeours were also made to flee
And by argus there gained no rau^son
She fettryd was and put in strong prison
But her son good mercurius
Right fresshe / right lusty / and full of hardynesse
And of his erthely joy
Against argus began his power dress
And so entierly did his besinesse
And was slain in conclusion
And Isis after deliueryd fro prison
Of her sleightes afterward not feynt
She took a ship and to egypt went
In which ship there was a cow depeyn^
And thoures whom Jupiter also sent
Is goon with her both of one intent
To a marriage after anon right
Between her and apys a prince full of might
She was right wise above other creatures
Secret of cunynge well expert in science
She taught first letters and figures
To egipciens by pleyn experience
Yaue them cu^nynge and intelligence
To tile the land taught the labourerys
To sow their greyne / and multiply by years
And in egypt her fame and her renoun
Began day by day wext her worthynesse
Hold of cunning and of reputacion
By signs showed not only in princess
But she was hold among them a goddess
And with worshipes which were deuyne
And sacrificis to her they did enclyne
But to declare plainly at a word
In mids of all her great prosperity
Mighty apes her husbonde and her lord
Prince of egypt and lord of that cuntre
Son of Jupiter and of Neobe
Which Niobe by long descendynge
The daughter was of prothemeus the king
And phoroneus first the laws fond
To which all crete sto^de under obeysaunce
And the statutes of that mighty land
Were vnstablysshyd by his ordinance
But for to write the unhappy chance
Of king Apys that is remembryd
He slain was and pitously dismembryd
By his brother called Tyffeus
Sumwhat of hatred but more for couetyse
For Tiffeus was only desirous
To reioise in full mortal wise
The mighty kingdom as ye have herd deuyse
Of Argiuois to have possession
Preferryd by murdre and false succession
And when that Isis found her lord so deed
Of intent that he was magnifyed
First of wisdom she began take heed
Ordained a mean that he were deified
High among gods to be stellifyed
In egypt temples made to be stallyd
And god Sirapis after he was called
Of Grysiton that his members cete for hungre
wHat shall I write of caas horrible
Of grisiton with hungre so constreyned
That his life was to him self odible
In Tessalie with indigence peynyd
And p^tously his fame was disteyned
When he sold his daughter in seruage
Li^^ope which was but young of age
^y enchaunge of god to puruey them vytayle
Of ver^y need he was so woo bigon
He had no thing that might his thirst avail
Neither stau^^he his hu^gre with gnawyng on a bone
Wherefore he ^^te his members one by one
A pri^^e alas was it not great pity
To se him dye in such aduersite
We had also radde full many a day to fore
The great banysshynge and persecucion
Of Arguiois how king Gela^or
Was cruelly put from his region
And his lieges of indignacion
In his place they set one Danaus
Son and also heir to the god belus
The people of malice did him so encombre
To encrese his sorrow and his aduersite
And fifty daughters he had also in noumbre
And edippus his brother also parde
Had fyfty sons the story ye may se
Atwene the which in suretye of hand
In marriage there was made a bond
Under the which compassyd was treason
Covertly though they did it hyde
But if ye lift have clear inspection
Of this story upon every side
Read the legende of Cupide
Which that Chancer in order as they stood
Compyled of wymen that were called good
Touching the story of king pandion
And of his goodly fair daughters tweyne
How therens false of condition
Them to disseyue did his besy pain
They both named of bewte souereyne
Goodly progne and young philomene
Both innocentys of intent full clean
Their pitous fate in open to express
It were to me but a presumption
Since that chancer did his besynes
In his legende as made is mention
Their martyrdom and their passion
For to reherce them did his besy pain
As chief poet called of bretaigne
Of good wymen a book he did write
The noumbre vncomplete fully of nyntene
And there the story plainly he did endyte
Of theseus / of prongne and philomene
Where ye may se their legende thus I mean
Do them worship and forth their life do show
For a clear myrrour because there be but few
I woll pass over and speak of them no more
And unto cadmus forth my style dress
In my writing yet it greuyth me sore
Touching of wymen of feith or stablenesse
Blessed be god I find none excess
And for there been so few as thinkyth me
The good should be had in more deynte
Lenuoye
THis tragedye berith to you witness
How saturnus by disposicion
Maliciously of his frowardness
Causes in Juno full great infection
She of nature conueyeth the nature down
The air infecte which no man may socoure
Comes death anon and all thing does devour
Time from adam mine auctour does express
Down to nembroth by computacion
His style conveyed by great auysenesse
From zorastres to king pharaon
Of two deluges he makyth mention
In thessalye the vengeance began labor
And in achaia thebes to devour
Ye have of heetis herd the excess
Of princes princesses full great destruction
Of egistus the great wretchidnesse
The furye of therens the woe of pandyon
Of the two susters the confusion
And how their fate began upon them loure
Their felicite unwarily to devour
Princes princesses your iyen do up dress
I mean the iyen of your discrecion
Se of this world the change the doubleness
The great vnsurenesse the variacion
And aduertith for all your great renoun
Fortunes dewes when they most swetly shoure
Than is she falsest your glory to devour
How Jupiter rauysshyd Europe and how Cadmus was sent to seek her in diverse
regions
tHe rehersayle of many an old poet
By descent the line conveyed down
Next saturnus the mighty king of crete
Jove was crownyd by succession
As next his heir by procreacion
After his fadre the land to enherite
Regnynge in crete as poets list to write
One of the lynage as I you told aforne
Of the gods most souereyne and entere
And though he was of blood so high y borne
He chees Europe for to be his fere
And down descendyd from his heavenly spear
And he that w^ for all his deite
Supposing in heart with her great beauty
And she was daughter to mighty king
Called Agenor by lynall descent
Whose mighty kingdom and ryall fair dwelling
Was in phenyce toward the orient
And to arabic his land was adjacent
Far by south as ye may read and se
Toward the ptyes of the read se
But Jupiter when he did aduer^
Of Europa the great semelynesse
He thought he was woundyd to the heart
Unto the death biholdynge her fairness
And for his constrent and his mortal distress
Seeing she was so fair in his sight
He rauysshyd her of very force and might
But Agenor his own fadre dear
Bigan on this caas full pitously complain
When she alas most goodly and entere
Was him bicaught which doubled all his pain
Recure was none though he did pleyne
Till he remembrynge on his regalie
Thought he would send to aspye
His son cadmus her to recure again
For to search her in many a region
Whereso his labor were fructuous or in vein
His fader set him a fell condition
Not to return by none occasion
And thereupon made him to be bound
Till that he had the kings daughter found
He took his ships by great auysenesse
And biganne to sail in many a strange se
Did his labor and his business
With many a worthy that were with him preue
But when that he of reason did se
There was no mean for which that he was sent
For to accomplessh the fine of his intent
Which glad heart deuoyde of gruchynge
Seeing the caas froward and contrary
Humble of his chere took his excellynge
And of manhood list not him self despair
But his meyne knyghly began repair
Toward greece and pitously there to land
Of appollo for to understand
To what party that he might draw
He prayed god to wysse him or read
Su^me token show or su^me manner law
Into what I Will that he might him speed
Or that he would graciously him led
Where as he might bylde a cite
That were according to him and to his meyne
And to appollo he did sacrifice
And made to him his oblacion
The god requyrynge goodly to deuyse
To what land or to what region
For this dwelling and habitacion
He should draw withouten more obstacle
For him and his to make his habitacle
And cadmus thus before appollo stood
Knelynge emonge with full great reverence
And in the temple of delpho still abode
With humble entendaunce and devout diligence
Mekely besekynge by word or by some sentence
That appollo would to him unclose
To what party he should him self dispose
This was his answer in conclusion
As the statue to him did express
To go and search cuntrees enuyron
And till he fond do his besynes
A ^ole that were excellent of fairenes
Which by precept of appolles law
Had neuyr aforne in yoke ydrawe
And where that ever seeking that he fond
A bole stand still in his pasture
Appollo bad upon that same land
Where as he sees this sight of adventure
That he should do his besy cure
To bylde a cite he and his folks all
And bo^cia after the bole it call
And when that cadmus the precept understood
And in searching did his business
He fond a place where a bole stood
Fedynge him self which as by likeness
Was a place full plesaunt of largess
Where as he stynt he ganne a cite reyse
Which that poets greatly commend and preyse
And that his byldynge might the more avail
All the foreyns that did about him dwell
Full like a knight by force and by battle
Out of that cuntre he did them expelle
Reisynge a cite which that did excelle
And as Ouyde also records the same
Unto this day of thebes berith the name
And he was not only glorified
For rerynge up of this great cite
But he was also magnifyed
For his manhood and his magnanymyte
And most cu^mendyd if ye list to see
For the surmountynge and famous excellence
Which that he had in wisdom and science
For as mine auctour of him list endite
Through his noble prudent purueaunce
He taught figures and litters for to write
And made laws of full great ordenaunce
Among the greges and set governance
Their vicious life by virtue to restreyne
And who outrayed was punysshyd with the pain
And of intent to increase his lynage
And his cite also for to multiply
He took a wife that was but young of age
And she was called as books specify
Hermyone and touching her allye
Though that she were borne of riall blood
She was also both Ioly fair and good
And this was done as writith mine auctour
After the death of worthy Iosue
Sothonyel being successor
Having the ledynge and the souereynte
Of isra^ll when thebes the cite
Was foundyd first in the days old
By king cadmus tofore as I you told
Four daughters he had by his live
Full fair echon and goodly unto se
And their names to reherce blyue
Semely was the eldest and next to anthonoe
The third in order was called ynoe
And Agaue was youngest of them all
Of the which daughters thus it is byfalle
They were echon of port and of manner
Full well fauouryd in every mannys sight
Right womanly and heavenly of their chere
And for their bewte their fader anon right
As it was sittynge with all his full might
Like their estates their birth and also their age
Made them be weddyd and ioynyd in marriage
To worthy princes his lynage to auaunce
And they encresyd by procreacion
Whereof the king had full great plesaunce
And great reioysynge in his oppynyon
To save his line by generation
With his neuewys and cosyns of allye
Fro to day to day to wexe and multiplye*
And this encreasyd his felicite
When he cosideryd verily in deed
The rich byldynge of his ryall cite
And fortune did his bridell led
To great riches in books as I read
To great nobles having great residence
In his cite of most magnificence
His daughter Semel record of mine auctour
Though she descendyd were of the blood riall
To Iubiter she was peramour
And by his power supercelestiall
She conceyuyd in especial
As poetis of her list to endite
Him that is god of grapes read and white
Called Bachus which has the governance
Of wynes all and the regalie
Whereof after was take full great vengeance
For when Juno did first aspye
Of Jupiter the great auoutrie
Of great hatred and enuyous desire
She made semel to be brent with sodeyn fire
By descendynge of a sodeyn leuene
And on semel the vengeance is down went
And for the flawme consumyd was and spent
There was of her left no remembrance
But of the end the woeful mortal chance
Also actheon the son of Acthonie
The great myscheuys and infortunys borne
Whose fader was called Eristee
Come of the kynred that I you told to forne
With cruel hounds allas he was to torn
For that he saw as books of him tell
Diane nakyd bath her in a well
And as poetys remember at the lest
When the ladies of thebes the cite
Heelde of Bachus solemly the feast
The youngest suster called agane
Daughter to cadmus allas it was pite
Against her own son dear
She was so wode and mortal of her chere
Murtherynge him in full cruel wise
In her rage she was so furious
For he lough at the sacirfise
In Thebes done by wymen to Bachus
The which son was called Pantheus
Whom that she slew with a sharp darte
In her woodnesse as she him found aparte
These great myscheuys fill in the line
Of king cadmus through his unhappy chance
Fortune his noblesse ganne undermine
And thought she would his glory disauaunce
All worldly gladness is medlyd with greuaunce
Experiens in Cadmus ye may se
So importable was his aduersite
For while he sat most highest in his glory
No part clipsyd of his prosperity
His bright renown and his riall memory
In realms spredde and many a fair cuntre
He most wilful in his high see
Sat with his lynage most high in noblesse
Than came fortune the false enchaunteresse
Of wilfulness and fond occasion
Against cadmus and made his renoun dulle
Of his kynred by false cullusion
She ganne away the brightest feathers pulle
And when his shynynge was wex up to the fulle
After the change of fortunes law
His glory began discrece and withdraw
It was more grievous to his dignynyte
A sodeyn fall from his high noblesse
Than if that he had neuir be
Set in the state of so great worthynesse
For the furious mortal heaviness
Of his kynrede without any more
Would have greuyd a poor man full sore
And among his sorrows euerychon
To reherce plainly as it was
I dare afferme how that there was one
Most horrible and dredefull in such a caas
For Cadmus son called adamas
His son in law through falls maloncolye
Fell suddenly into a fren^sye
Of whom the wife was called Inoe
Cadmus daughter as ye have herd express
Which through the constreynt of his infirmyte
In his rage and furious wodenesse
Thought that his wife was a lioness
And in his wild ymaginacions
That his ij children was also ij lions
And upon them full loud he ganne to cry
Toward his wife in have he began anon
And from her armies there was no remedy
The child he rent and on a cragge stone
He began to birst it and break it every bone
The which child bochas writith thus
Full tender and young called was learchu^
And all this woeful and sodeyne adventure
Of this rage when that she took head
As most sorouful of any creature
Her other child she hent anon for dread
For of socoure she knew no better speed
So as she might began have out of his sight
But willaway as she took her to flight
And her husbonde came after pursuynge
Like a wode lion in his cruelte
Dou^ from a mounteyn which was dependynge
She and her child fill into the se
Was it not reuth / was it not pite
A kings daughter her lord in thebes crownyd
He to be wode and she for fere to be drownyd
Lo here the syne of Cadmus eueridele
^is (...) slain and his allies all
And he him self from fortunes whele
When he wenyd leest full suddenly is fall
Hi^ l^^^ll sugre tempred with much gall
For among all his mortal peynes
Hi^ l^ge men of thebes Citesynes
(...) against him conspiracion
(...) him (...) e^il and his wife also
(...) sons his daughters brought to destruction
(...) the encreasynge of his mortal woo
(...) his wife compellyd both two
For ve^^^y pouert and verrey indigence
In (...) last age to purchase their dispense
(...) of cadmus the sorrows to descryue
And his mischief to put in remembrance
He banysshyd was twyes by his live
First by his faders cruel ordinance
Of his suster to make enquyraunce
And of there last in his weldy age
He was compellyd to hold his passage
Out of thebes his wife and he allone
In sorrow and weeping to accomplisshe their days
Into Ill^rie togedre they be gone
There paciens put at fell assayes
Whoos bitterness felt none alaies
Also of their end and unhappy fate
Neither of their death I find none other date
Save that Ouide makith mention
And John Bochas the poet excellent
Say that two brethren zeto and amphion
Out of thebes both by one assent
Have this cadmus into ixil sent
His wife also after their high noblesse
To end their life in sorrow and wretchidnesse
But the gods of mercy and pity
When they them saw by fortune thus cast down
From their estates into great pouertye
Having of them full great passion
They made of them a transformacion
Of both tweyne them yeuynge a likeness
Of serpentys to live in wilderness
Lenuoye
O what astate may him self assure
For to conserve his life in sikernesse
What worldly joy may here long endure
Or where shall men find now stablenesse
Since kings princes from their high noblesse
Record of cadmus ben suddenly brought low
And from the whele of fortune overthrow
Who may sustain the pitous adventure
Of this tragedy by writing to express
It is like unto the chau^tplure
Beginning with joy ending in wretchydnesse
All worldly bliss is meynt with bytternesse
The sodeyn change thereof moy no man know
For who sittyth highest is sonest overthrow
Was in this world yet neuyr creature
Rekyn up princes for all their high noblesse
Fortune could enclyne them to her lure
And them enperissh through her frowardness
Wherefore ye lords with all your great richesse
Be ware before or ye dance in the row
Of such as fortune has from her whele overthrow
A process of Oetes king of Colchos / Jason / Medee. Theseus Scilla Nisus and
other mo
When John bochas was most indigent
To considre the successions
Of lynagys with all his intent
In his writynge and descripcion
To compile the generacions
Of many noble famous of estate
I mean of such as were unfortunate
In his serchinge he fond not out a few
Were unhappy found in their living
To his presence anon there began him show
A multitude full pitously weeping
Amongys which full doolfully pleynynge
Came forth Oetes and has compleynt begu^ne
King of Colchos and sone unto the su^ne
For of Phoebus which is bright and clear
Poetis write that he was son and heir
Because he was so mighty of power
So fresshe / so lusty / manly / and right feyre
But of fortune he fill in great despair
Cursynge his fate and his destayne
When Jason first entryd his cuntre again
By Pelleus sent from Tessalye
Therefore to accomplissh by diligent labor
The great emprises thorugh his chyualrye
If god and fortune list do to him favor
They might win the tresoure
This is to mean that he were so bold
The ram to assail which bare the flees of gold
This Jason thorugh counseil of Medee
By sorcerye and incantacion
The bole slough horrible for to se
And venquesshed the venymous dragon
The king despoilyd of his possession
Acomplisshed with carectis and figuris
Of Colchos the dredefull auenturis
And afterward when he his purpose had
He left Oetes in full great despeire
And Medea forth with him he ladde
And her brother which was the kings heir
But as I find how in his repeire
Out of Colchos when they ganne remewe
King Oetes after them ganne sue
Upon Jason auengyd for to be
Without tariynge he followed proudly
The which thing when Jason did se
This medea ganne shape a remedy
She took his brother and slew him cruelly
And him dismembryd as bokys make mind
And pecemeel in a feeld bihinde
He ganne him cast all bespreynt with blood
Whereof his fader when he had a sight
Full pale of chere still in the field he stood
While she and Jason took them unto flight
I trow that time the most woeful wight
That was on live when he did know
His child dismembryd and a broad Isowe
Which cause was alas and welawaye
That he so stynt as man disconsolate
While that Jason fro Colchos went away
And Medea most unfortunate
Was rote and ground of this mortal debate
For who saw ever or read of such another
To save a stranger list to sle her brother
Forsook her fader / her cuntre and kynrede
The land enperisshid through her robberye
Of her worship took none other head
Love has her brouht in such a fantasye
And while that she abode in Tessalie
And with Jason did there soiourne
She made Eson to youth return
A yerde she took that was dry and old
And with her herbs and co^mixtions
She made it boil / in Ouide it is told
And by car^^tys and incantacions
And with the craft of her coniuracions
The yerde bygan to bud and blosme new
And to bear fruit and leuys fresshe of hew
And semblably with her confe^tio^s
His old humors she has depuryd clean
And with her lusty fressh pocions
His empty skyn tremlyng and right lene
Pale and wanne that no blood was seen
But as it were a dedely creature
All this has she transfourmyd by nature
Made him lusty and fressh of his courage
Glad of heart / lifly of ^here and sight
Right well cheryd and clear of his visage
Wonder deliver both of force and of might
In all his members as weeldy and as light
As ^uir he was in the same estate
By craft of Medee he was so alterat
After all this against king pelleus
She began to malign uncle unto Jason
And of envy she procedith thus
The kings daughters she drawith unto her anon
Them counseylinge that they should goon
Unto their fader and plainly unto him s^ien
If he des^^ed to be young again
Full restoryd his force to recure
And therwithall in lusty age flower
She behight to do her besy cure
Like his desire to help and socoure
And in this matter so craftly labor
Finally stand in the same caas
To be made young as his brother was
Touching which thing for more evidence
T^^s Medea has to the daughters told
^f ^^tent to give the more credence
S^e ^ad them take a ram that was right old
And with a knyfe for to be so bold
^o ^^e the best before them there he stood
And in a vessel draw out in old blood
F^lly ^ffermynge like as it were true
That (...) should be a lombe again
For ye by ^^afte would his blood remewe

Thereof ^^lde no token should be seyn

As was a l^mbe ^yned of one year
(...) hereupon in such sleyghty wise
She ^^ganne a process of full false treason
(...) ^^s^^r made upon that lombe to practyse

The old ram to feme a lamb ageyn

Of ^^uye and venymous hatrede

(...) sharp knyues they made her fader blede
A^ yddes the heart through out every vein
Supposyng the sely susters tweyne
That P^lleus renewyd should be
To youth again of force and of substance
But finally by treason and Medee
He lo^te his life such was his woeful chance
She this wrought only for vengeance.
As ^ote and ground of this cruel deed
Against the nature of all womanhede
Supposing in her opinion
The death greatly should please
Of pelleus unto her lord Jason
Thorugh great encerase set his heart at ese
But it reboundyd into his dissese
That finally Jason her forsook
For his offense and he his wey took
In to Corynth to the king of Creon
Whoos daughter Crewso for her great beutye
Was aftirwarde weddyd to Jason
But when this wedding was known to Medee
Cast she would thereon auengyd be
Began to conspyre of malice and envy
And thorugh her magik and her sorcery
In full great have ganne to ordeyne
A lityll coffre only of intent
And by her young fair sons tweyne
With other Jewels she has it sent
Unto Crewso making a present
Which of malice she list to dispose
That when crewso the coffre did unclose
The fire brast out a full large space
^^ent crewso by full great violence
Set a fire plainly all the place
By enchauntement there was no resistance
All went a fire that was in her presence
By vengeance did full great damage
But when Jason this fire saw in his rage
And considerid the malice of Medee
Thought he would do execucion
For to punysshe the great inequyte
Against him compassyd of treason
For she of vengeance against all reason
After that Crewso consumyd was and brent
Her own sonne^ with that she had sent
Without routh or womanly pity
She fasly murdryd the children that she bare
Like a stepmoder auengyd for to be
Cut their throtys or that they were ware
Against nature there was none other spare
But for hatred she had unto Jason
After this murdre she fled away anon
So escapynge his indignacion
By craft of magyk she went at liberte
To Athenys and in that regyon
She weddyd was unto the king Egee
Not long after a son by him had she
The which child my^ auctour tellith th^s
After Medea called was Medus
Aftir wh^^^ name the famous region
I named (...) ^^ich called is mede
But following euir her old condition
This Medea void of shame and dread
Compassyd has of wilful falls hatrede
That theseus the son of king Egee
With new poison shall deuouryd be
But theseus full like a manly knight
In repayringe home to his cuntre
Of high prudence aspyed anon right
The mortal vengeance the great cruelte
Of this stepmoder which of enmyte
Concludyd has in her entencion
Him to destroy unwarily with poison
Her heart of malice cruel and horrible
As she that was with treason ever alied
When that she saw her purpose most odible
By king Egeus fully was aspyed
She has her heart and wyttys new applied
As in their bokys poetis have compylyd
Again to Jason to be reconciled
She fled away for fere of theseus
Lest he had done her vengeance
And finally as writ ovidius
And moral senek concludith in sentence
In his tragedies making rememberaunce
How medea like as poetis se^en
Unto Jason restoryd was again
Touching the end of their furious discord
Poetys make thereof no mention
Neither tell no meene how they fill acorde
But if it were by incantacion
Which so well could turn vpso down
Sundry things of love and of hatred
And in bochas of her no more I read
Save when she had fulfylyllyd her purpos
Mine auctour tellith that Jason and mede
Reuokyd have again unto Calchos
Her fadre Oetis and from her pouerte
Brought him again into his riall se
And to his crown by force they him restore
Touching his end of him find I no more
Thus his fortune has turnyd to and fro
First like a king having full great richesshe
After living in pouerte and in woo
Sithen restoryd to his worthynesse
Thus euir sorrow meynt with gladness
Who can aduert in all worldly thing
Record of Mynos the noble worthy king
To whom I must new my style dress
Follow the tracis of bochasius
The which Minos as ouyde does express
Touching his birth he writith plainly thus
That he was manly wise and virtuous
Sone by descent of iubiter the great
And of Europa born to be eire of crete
And of his person wonder delitable
Full renomyd of wisdom and of science
By diverse titles of laud commendable
Of birth / of blood / of kynghode and / prudence
For by his study and enteer diligence
He foonde first laws groundyd on reason
Whereby of Crete the famous region
Governed was and set in stablenesse
All injuries and wrongs to refourme
Made statu^ys extorcions to repress
Of rightwisnesse they took the first form
And that each man should him confourme
Like their degrees suget and souereyne
That no man had a matter to complain
He made his liegis to live in quyete
Cl^re shinynge in his riall noblesse
With sword and ceptre sitting in his sete
And while he floured in his worthynesse
He took a wife of excelent fairness
Daughter to phoebus in bochas ye may se
And she was called fair posiphe
And her fader by record of writing
In his time was holden full famous
Of the I Will of roodes he was lord and king
And in his days of port full gloriouse
Right proud in armies and victorious
Taking witness Methamorphoseos
His daughter had three children by Mynos
The first a son called Androgee
And afterward full fair daughters tweyne
Right goodly and womanly unto se
But like as fortune did for them ordeyne
They felt their self great trouble and great pain
The one called Adryana and phedra that other
Following their fate it might be none other
Androgeus by king Mynos was sent
For he should profit in clergy
To athenes of virtuous intent
There to study in philosophy
And for he began to encrece and multiply
And pass all other by study in learning
And to ex^elle his fellows in cu^nynge
They of envy and false malice alas
Made against him a conspiracion
And from a pynacle sacryd to pallas
Of full great heith they made him tumble down
For which iniurye bochas makyth mention
^^s fader Minos a vengyd for to be
Leide a great power about the cite
He cast him fully that no man should him let
But that he would do cruelly vengeance
And round about so sore he them beset
With men of arms and with his ordenaunce
That finally he brought them to outraunce
And them constreynyd within a little space
Their life their death submyttynge to his grace
But while they made against him resistance
Supposinge his power to withstonde
Nisus that was king of Magarence
Against Minos their pertye took an hand
And often times as ye shall understand
When king Minos did the cite assail
Nisus withinne with mighty apparayle
Upon the wallys stood in his defense
When that Minos full like a manly knight
Faught without with sturdy violence
Like mars himsilfe in steel armyd bright
Whereof when Scilla oonys had a sigh^
Doughtir to Nisus aduertynge his prowes
Anon for love she fill in great distress
She was supprisyd with his high noblesse
His manly force expert many fold
Set scilla in great heaviness
For love of Minos in poetis it is told
Make her heart presume and be bold
First her life to put in iuperdye
Her faders life the cite the clergy
From her heart love has set a side
Against nature her blood and her kynrede
And all friendship from her ganne diuyde
And of her worship she took no manner head
Love made her cruel against all womanhede
First her heart so sore set a fire
Her faders death falsely to conspyre
For king Mynos being a straungere
Was so enpryntyd in her oppynyon
Of creatures there stood none so nere
And for his sake by full false treason
She compassyd the destruction
First of her fader and the cite
So strange a thing alas how might it be
That a woman of years young and tender
Could ymagyne so merueilous a thing
But it fallith that creatoures slendre
Under face of angelik lokynge
Been verrey wolves outewarde in werkynge
Also under color of their port femynyne
Su^me been found verrey serpentyne
Lambys in showing shadowyd with meekness
Cruel as tigris who does to them offense
Of hunmble chere pretendynge a likeness
But woe alas what harm does appearance
What damage does counterfete innocence
Under amantyll shrowdyd of womanhede
When feynyd falsnesse does the brydell led
For this Scilla the kings daughter dear
In whom he set his hole affection
His hertis joy his plesaunce most enteer
His worldly bliss his consolacion
But she all turnyd to his confusion
Not like a daughter but like a sorceresse
His death compassyd the story berith witness
Her fader had a fatell here that shone
Brighter than gold in which did assure
Manly to fight against his mortal foon
For in his head while it did endure
He should venquessh and recure
And thorugh his knghthode to his encreas of glory
In every quarrel win the victory
But when king Nysus her fader lay and sleep
Upon a night ^^^ell before day
Full secretly or that he took keep
The here of gold this scilla cut away
And unto Mynos armyd where he lay
She him presentyd thorugh her ordinance
Of falls intent him for to do plesaunce
But in this matter like as writith ouyde
Methamorphoseos who so takith head
Her fader slepynge she knelynge by his side
Took a sharp knyfe without feere or dread
While he lay nakyd she carf atwo his head
Stale away of full falls intent
And to king Mynos the head she does present
And in her coming to his presence
Her faders head when she before him laid
Nothing ashamyd of her great offense
Unto Mynos thus she did obrayde
And with bold chere even thus she said
My lord quoth she with support of your grace
Yeueth to my tale leyser time and space
Certys my lord love has excityd me
And constreyned to this cruel deed
To sle my fader distroye my cite
For to get me worship forsake womanhede
And made me hardy to make my fader blede
Things horrible thus have I undertake
For to accomplissh only for your sake
My self disherityd for love of your person
Called in my cuntre a falls traitouresse
Disconsolate stale away alone
Of new diffamed and named a maistresse
Of falls murdre I bring a great witness
My faders head and his dedly visage
Against nature to forther your viage
Wherefore I pray that ye list aduertyse
And considre like a gentle knight
How I for love toward your great emprise
And to great fortherynge also of your right
Have first my fader deprived of his might
R^ft him his life despoilyd his riches
To do plesaunce to your high noblesse
And no thing axe unto my guerdon
Neither to my reward that me avail
But that I might have full possession
Of your person most worthy in battle
For there is no tresour that might countiruayle
To my desire as that ye would in deed
Goodly accept me and my manhede
Ye may me save and spyll with a word
Make most glad and most dolerous
I not require of you my souereyn lord
But that ye would be to me gracious
For blood and kyn and my faders hou^
All left behind if ye list aduerte
And vndepartyd give to you mine her^
Which to your highness ought Enough suffice
All thing consideryd in your riall astate
Conceived also how in uncouth wise
For your love I stand desolate
Save of your mercy full disconsolate
Here is al and sum your love I bye so sore
But ye do grace I can say you no more
And when she had her tale told knelynge
With amaner of pretense of womanhede
Of all her treson a point not concelynge
The king ystonyed of her horrible deed
By great auys peised and took head
It was not sittynge to prince or to king
To do favor to so froward a thing
With troubled heart and with a face pale
His look vpcast said god forbede
That ever in cronycle in storye or in tale
That any man should of Mynos read
How he supportyd so venymous a deed
Favor a woman alas and welawey
Which slough her fader when he abed lay
But for your hateful and unkind rage
I pray the gods echon and saturn
For to take vengeance on your falls outrage
For every where wheder ye do return
And every place where as ye soiourne
Land and se shortly to express
They been enfecte with your cursydnesse
Your own mouth your outrage does accuse
And your acts ben so abhomynable
That your gifts fully I do refuse
They been so froward and so reprouable
That your person disnaturell and unstable
Within my court it were a thing not fair
That ye should abide or have repair
Ye be so hateful on every side
And contrarious of condision
I pray Tellius which of the earth is guide
And to Nemtunus I make this oryson
As far as stretchith their damynacion
Under the bond of their regaile
A dwelling place that they to you deny
When Mynos his answer thus deuyse^
On reason groundyd and equity
And scilla saw how she was despysyd
Knew no party passage ne cuntre
To find socour wheder she might fle
But despired like a traitouresse
Toward the se anon she began her dress
To enter the watir plainly if she might
For verrey shame her self for to shroude
And when the gods thereof had a sight
They turned her as they that might and could
Into a quail for to sing loud
Her fader Nysus they did also transmewe
Into a sparow^ the quayle to pursue
This was the end of Nisus Scille
And afterward of athenes the town
Was yeldyd up to stand at the will
Of king Mynos without condition
Every year by reuolucion
They of the cite should not delay
Nine of their children for a tribute pay
This was by Mynos the emposicion
Upon athenes and of verry dread
They obeyed as made is mention
And their children year by year they led
In to crete the Minataur to feed
Unto this monstre ordained for repast
Which at their coming devoured were in have
But or that I forther do proceed
In this matter I woll do my cure
To declare if ye list to take heed
Of this monstre to tell the engend^ure
Uncouth to here and against nature
For by the writynge of Oiudius
This ougly be was engendryd thus
Methamorphoseos the manner ye may se
Mynos had a bole of great fairness
White as milk and the queen posiphe
Louyd him so hoot the story berith witness
And dedalus did his besinesse
By subtle craft and made his gynnes so
That against kind with her he had to do
And conceyuyd a be monstrous
That was departed half bole half man
And as the poet by writing techith us
Of all Minataurus thus the name bygan
And dedalus not long after when
That this monstre was by the queen forth brought
This subtle werkman has an house I wrought
Called Roboryntus diverse and uncouth
Full of wrynkellys and of strangeness
Ougly to know which is north or south
Or to what part a man should him dress
Folks were there blent with furious derkenes
Who that entrid his return was in veyn
Without aclewe for to resort ageyn
Of Mynotaurus this was the habitacle
Like a presone made for turmentric
For dampnyd folk a peynefull tabernacle
For all that lay there in iupardie
The monstre must devour them and diffie
And specially was ordeynyd this turment
For all that were down from athenes sent
But in this matter some folk vary
And afferme how that queen Posiphe
Of king Mynos louyd a secretarye
Called taurus in bochas ye may se
And thus the king for all his rialte
Disceyued was for who may any while
Him self preserve where wymen list begyle
For by this taurus bochas berith witness
Queen posiphe had a child full fair
Mynos not knowing by no likeness
But that the child was borne to be his heir
His trust was good he fill in no despair
For su^me husbondes as poetis have compilyd
Which most assure rathest been begylyd
Innocentys can not deem amys
Namely of wives that been found true
Clerkys may write but doutles thus it is
Of their nature they love no things new
Steadfast of heart they change not their hew
Haukys best preuyd sumtyme a chek can make
Yet for afaute the foul is not forsake
Of this matter write I woll no more
But aye the tribute and seruage of the town
Procedith forth they constreyned were so sore
Like as their lot turnyd up and down
For there was made none excepcion
Of high ne low neither for sour ne sweet
But as it fill they were sent into crete
The statute was so ynly rigerous
They to^e their sort as it came about
Till at the last it fill on theseus
That he might goo forth among the route
King Eges son being in great doubt
Touching his life which might not be socouryd
But that he must with other be deuouryd
Which theseus for his worthynesse
And of his knyghthode for the great encrees
Through manly force and for his prowes
Sumtyme was called the secunde hercules
Among amazones he put him self in prees
Weddyd Ipolito as books specify
The hardy queen called of femynye
And afterward to thebes he is gone
Halpe there the ladies in especial
Which that compleyned upon the king Creon
Which them distroublyd like their astate riall
To hold and halowe the festys funeral
Of their lords and queen's and princessis
Of wifly troth to show their kyndnessis
For when this duke the manner had seen
And of Creon the great iniquite
To the ladies he made deliver ageyn
The lords boones of ruth and of pity
Yet in his youth out of his cite
He was deliueryd by statute full odible
To be deuouryd of this be horrible
He gothe to prison for all his semelynesse
As the statute felly did ordeyne
But of ruthe and gentylnesse
Him to preserve from that dedely pain
Of king minos the goodly doughtres tweyne
Adriane shope a remedy
And feir phedra that he should not dye
Through her help he has the monstre slain
That was dredefull and ugly for to se
By them he scapyd whereof he was full feign
Led them with him toward his contre
And by the way deuoide of all pite
Adriane full falsely he has forsake
A yenst his suraunce and phedra he has take
In myddys the sea he left her in an isle
Toward no pertye she knew no declyne
She wepyth she cries alas the herd while
For of her fate this was the mortal fine
That for pity bachus the god of wine
Took her to wife whoo^ crown of stones fine
Does now in heuyn with ix sterres shine
Thus of theseus ye may behold and se
To adriane the great unsteadfastness
The great vntreuth the mutabilite
The broke assurance and the newefanglenesse
But sely women keep their steadfastness
Euyr vndefoulyd save su^tyme of their kind
They must them puruay when me^ be found unkind
Of theseus I can no more now seyn
In this matter to make of him memory
But to king minos I woll resort ageyn
To tell how fortune euyr falls and transitory
In what poyntys diffacid has his glory
First of echoon bochas does specify
Of posiphe the foul aduoutrye
Which was his wife and stood well in his grace
To his plasaunce she was most souereyne
But a cloud of a small trespace
Made her lord at her disdeyne
But he of wisdom bare pryuely his pain
For such caas this is my sentence
Let prudent husbondes take them to patience
On other things Mynos began also complain
Having in heart thereof full great greuaunce
That he so lost his fair daughters tweyne
And Mynotaurus slain with myschaunce
Also to him it was a great pain
That theseus was goon at liberte
And from all tribute delyueryd his cite
It greuyd him also in countenance and chere
That theseus Adriane forsook
It likyd him also not the manner
Unto his wife that she phedra took
And yet this phedra like as scith my book
Had two sons by this theseus
First demophan and next antiochus
Also theseus after began him draw
Toward cecile in steel armyd clean
With Pirotheus in armies his felawe
For to rauyssh proserpyna the queen
But of intent phedra full unclean
Louyd her stepsone called ypolitus
But for he was to her dangerous
And to her lust froward and contrary
In his apporte not goodly ne benygne
Of his false intent anon she began to varye
Against her full felly to malygne
With a prince of many token and sign
Of womanhede she began him accuse
Her a^outrye falsely to excuse
Who says that wymen can not ymagyne
In their diffence tales untrue
To their desire if men list not enclyne
Neither on their feynyd falls woo to rue
Anon they can cumpasse things new
Fysshe and find out of their entencion
A covert ^loude to shadow their treason
She has accusyd young ypolitus
Of falls auoutrye in his tender age
Told and affermyd to duke theseus
With full boolde chere and full pleyne visage
How he purposyd for to do outrage
Only by force her bewte to press
Her lord besechynge to rofourme and dress
The great iniquite done to his wife
While he was absent for thing that bare charge
Wives of tales sumtyme been inuentif
To suffer their tunges falsely flyen at large
But felkys that list of damage them discharge
Of such accusynge ne take they none head
^yll the truth be tried out in deed
I mean no thing of wives that been good
Neither of wymen that flouren in Innocence
For god forbede and the holy rode
But men should do due reverence
To their noblesse and their excellence
Declare their bounte and their virtue show
And more them cherisshe by cause there ben but few
Touching the accusynge against ypolitus
Though it so were that it was falls in deed
zit he for shame and feer of theseus
As in the story ye may behold and read
In his heart he caught a manner dread
That he alas this sely young knight
Fled and withdrowe him out of his faders sight
^is indignacion plainly for to eschew
Though by desert in him there was no lack
Of hasty dread as began remewe
Or in a chare or^on horse back
His horse afraid there fill a sodeyn wrack
Down from a roche pendaunt as ye shall lere
He and his chare were drownyd both in fere
Thus unguilty in his most lusty youth
He was conveyed to his destruction
The sclaunder conspired as it is well I couth
By falls phedra but in conclusion
The sclaundre turnyd to her confusion
For when she wist Ipolitus was deed
Through her defaute anon for shame and dread
She took a sword full sharp I whet and ground
And therwithall she raft her heart atweyne
Lo how that vengeance woll ever again rebounde
On them that falsely do their besy pain
Lo sclaundre folk for like as they ordeyne
With their diffamys other folkys tawyte
God at last their malice can aquyte
But some books of phedra do record
That she ashamed and confus of this deed
Hinge her self up full high with a cord
Lo how falls sclaundre can folk quyte for there mede
Wherefore I counseil every man take heed
In such matters as stand in uncertain
From his hasty langage his tongue to refreyne
Among these stories woeful for to read
All bespreynt with terys in his face
Full suddenly john bochas began take heed
In myddys the prees zisam came to place
And how that fortune began also the manace
This proud duke full mighty and notable
Of king Iabyn called the great constable
Of his ooste leder and gouernoure
To Israel verrey mortal foo
With people he rode like conqueror
And where that ever his meyne did goo
The earth quoke people dredde him so
Fled fro his face where as he ca^ a far
Nine hundred waynes he had for the werre
Strongly in armyd with hokys made like sithis
Who that approchyd to mayme and to wound
For this tiraunt of custum often sithis
Had great delight the Jews to confound
And all tho that his sword has found
King Iabyn bad prince Canaan
In israel to spare child ne man
This zisara was sent to be their scourge
By gods suffraunse their sins to chastise
Their old offencis to punyssh and to purge
As a flagell many sundry wise
But when of reason they began them better deuyse
And for their trespassys to fall in repentance
God began withdraw the hand of his vengeance
For in their myscheef they began the lord to know
Feeling the prick of his punycion
And mercy thanne has unbent the bow
Of his fell ire and castigacion
To god they made their inuocacion
And he them herd in their mortal dread
In iudicum the story ye may read
How in the while that this zisara
Shope him of new the jews to oppress
In their diffence god sent them Delbora
A prophetess the story berith witness
To give them counseyl their arms to redress
And by the spyrite of her prophecy
For to withstonde the great tyranny
Of zisara which was descendyd down
With a great oost into the field repeired
But desbora of high discrecion
When that she saw the jews dispeyryd
And for to fight their corages sore apeyred
She made him first devoutly in that dread
To cry to god to help them in their need
She was their Judge and their gouerneresse
Cheef of their counseyll and of custum she
Causis dependynge of great auysenesse
That stood in doubt by dome of equity
She tried them out under a palm tree
And was not hasty no matter to determyne
Till she the parties before did examyne
And when she herd and knew of coming
Of zisara with full great puissaunce
That was constable of that mighty king
Called Ia^yn with all his ordenaunce
Upon iewys for to do vengeance
This delbora began prudently entende
The iewys pertie by wisdom to diffende
She had barach her husbonde anon right
Of Neptalym ten thousand with him take
Against zisara to fight for their right
And that he should a great enarme take
But he for dread this iourne began forsake
And durst not against him tho verreye
But she were present and list him to conueye
Well well quoth she sith it stondith so
That of wantrust ye have a manner dread
I woll my self gladly with you goo
You to supporte in this great need
But trustith fully as ye shall find in deed
That a woman with laud honor and glory
Shall fro you win the price of this victory
It folowyd after sothely as she said
Auysely she made her ordenaunce
And the cheef charge on her self she laid
As princess of jews governance
And prudently began her self auaunce
With god conveyed and supporte of his grace
With zysara to mete in the face
And specially touching this viage
God took aweye the spirit and the might
Fro zisara his force and his courage
That he was ferdfull to enter into fight
Kept his chare and took him to flight
Knowing no place in surely to abide
Till that Iael a woman did him hide
Within her tent and almoost deed for dread
Under amantell desirous for to drink
She yaue him milk the sleep fill on his head
And while that he for heaviness began wynke
And sadly slepte she began her to bethynke
Thought she would for zisara so shape
That with the life he should not ascape
She took avail that was sharp and long
And covertly began her self auaunce
With an hamer mighty round and strong
She drove the nail lo this was her vengeance
Through out his head se here the sodeyn chance
On tyrantys that trust on fortune
Which woll not suffer them long to contune
In their falls vsurpyd tirannye
To hold people in long subietion
She can them blaundisshe with her flaterye
Under a color of falls collusion
And with a sodeyn transmutacion
Fortune them can that pore folk trouble
Reuerse their pride with their face double
And though she were defacid of figure
There showed in her a manner majesty
Of qu^enly honor pleynly to discure
Her infortunys and her infelicite
And to declare plainly / how that she
Of all princessis / which stood in estate
She was her self the most unfortunate
Which yaue to Bochas full great occasion
When he saw her pitous apparaile
For to make a lamentacion
Of uncouth sorrows / which did her assail
With a tragedye to weep and to wail
Her importable / and strange dedly strife
Which that she had during all her life
^e write of her a story large and plain
And of her birth / first he does diffyne
And affermeth in his book certain
She was discendyd of a noble line
In flourynge age / also when she did shine
She weddyd was for her great bewte
Unto the king of thebes the cite
Which in his time was called sayus
And when her womb by process did arise
The king was glad / and also desirous
The childys state to know in sum wise
And thought he would go do sacrifise
Unto appollo to have knowlechynge to forne
Touching this child when that it was borne
What should follow in conclusion
He was desirous / and hasty for to se
First by the heavenly disposicion
And by the favor if it would be
Of appollos mighty deite
To have answer among his wittys all
Of his child / what fate should bifalle
His answer thought it were contrary
To his desire / yet was it thus in deed
Appollo told him / and list no lengre tar^
That this child should verrely in deed
Sle his fadre / and make his sides blede
And with his hands there was none other weye
But on his sword he must nedis deye
The king was heavy / and trust on this sentence
Sorrowful of heart / god wot and no thing feign
And kest before through his prouydence
That his son should in all have be slain
And that he would not an hour delayne
After his birth but bad his men to goon
Into a forest and sle the child anon
Like his bidding the mynystres wrought in deed
Taking the child tender and young of age
And into a forest with them they began it led
To be deuouryd of bestes most savage
The mother alas almost fill into a rage
Seeing her child so inly fair of face
Shall thus be deed and did no trespace
Little wondre though she felt sm^rte
To all wymen I report me
And unto moders that been tender of heart
In this matter Iugis for to be
Was it not ruth was it not pite
That a princess a queen allas
Should know her child deuouryd in such caas
After his birth Layus took good keep
Without mercy respite or delay
That unto one which kept his sheep
This young child upon a certain day
Shall be delivered in all the haste he may
To this intent it might not be socouryd
But that it should of bestys be deuouryd
This said shepeherde goth forth anon right
The child benygne beholdynge of look and face
Thought in heart and in his inward sight
He should do to god a great traspace
To sle this child wherefore he did him grace
Took first a knyfe and did his besy pain
Through out his fete to make holes tweyne
Took a small rod of ayonge os^e^
Percyd the fete alas it was pite
Bond him fast and by good leiser
The young child he henge up on a tree
Of intent that he ne should be
Through wild bestes cruel and savage
Be suddenly deuouryd in their rage
Upon the tree while he henge thus bound
Of adventure by sum occasion
A strange sheepherde has the child I found
Which of ruth and of pite took him down
Bare with him home in to his town
Made his wife for to do her pain
To fostre the child with her brestys tweyne
And when he was brought forth and recuryd
And full made hole of his wounds sore
This young child which all this has enduryd
When he in age began to wexe more
And that nature began him to rostore
The seide sheepherde that louyd him best of all
After his hurtys Edippus did him call
For edippus is more to seyne
Who that conceyueth the exposicion
But fete I percyd throughout both tweyne
In that langage as made is mention
And Meropa wife of king Polibo^
The sheepherde of full humble intent
Began the child full lowly to present
And for she was bareyne of nature
She and the king of one affection
Took edippus both into their ^ure
As son and heir by adopcion
To reyne in corynth by succession
The king the queen of corinthe the cuntre
Had the child in so great cheerte
Let men considre in their discrecion
Sodeyne change of every manner thing
This child sent out for his destruction
And now prouydyd for to be a king
And through fortune ay double in werkynge
He that was refuse to bestys most savage
Is now received to knyghtly heritage
Destitute he was of his kynrede
Forsake and abject of blood and of allie
In tender youth his fete were made to blede
Henge on a tree and began for help cry
But god that can in myscheef magnefie
And reconfort lolke disconsolate
Has made this child now thus fortunate
And prouydyd to be a kings heir
Of him that stood of death in adventure
Fortune can show her self both foul and fair
Folkys brought low full well again recure
And such as patiently can endure
And list not grutch against their chastisynge
God out of myscheef can suddenly the^ bring
But when Edippus was grow up to age
Like a young prince encreasynge in noblesse
Lusty and strong and fressh of his courage
Of adventure it fell so in sothenesse
^^ther by strife or by su^ frowardness
Or by (...) con^e^ he had knowlechynge
How he was not son unto the king
As by descent b^t a fer foreyne
Whereupon full sore he bygan to muse
And for to know and be put in certain
Thought he would sum manner practik use
And to the king he began him self excuse
For a time withdraw his presence
Till that he knew by sum experience
Or by sum sign how the matter stood
Thought he would do his diligence
To know his fader and also of what blood
He was descendyd and have sum euydence
Touching troth how it stood in sentence
And herupon to be certified
Toward appollo fast he has him hyed
Which in Cyrra worshipped was that time
And yaue answer through his deite
To folk that came at even and at prime
Of every doubt and ambiguyte
And there Edippus falling upon his kne
After his offrynge had answer anon
Toward Greece he should gone
Unto a mounteyne that focis bare the name
And there he should of his kynrede here
Also like his faat the answer was the same
He should sle his own fader dear
And after that to thebes draw him nere
Wedde his mother of verrey ignorance
Called Iocasta through his unhappy chance
He list no longer tarry ne abide
This said edippus but forth in have goth he
And on his weye he began anon to ride
Till he the mounteyne of Pho^is did se
Under the which stood a great cuntre
Called Citoyens / which that time certain
Werr^ide them that were on the mounteyne
His fader layus through his chyualrye
With Citoicus is entryd into battle
And edippus came with the pertye
Of the hille armed in plate and mayle
And as they began each other to assail
Among the prees at the entrecountrynge
Of adventure Edippus slow the king
Unknown to him that he his fader was
Having thereof no suspection
Passyd his way platly this is the caas
And also unknow he came to the town
Of mighty thebes where for his high renoun
He was resceyuyd with full great reverence
Because that he slough in their diffence
Spynx the serpent horrible for to see
Sumtyme ordained by incantacions
For to distroy the town and the cuntre
By his compassyd sleighty quesicions
Slough man and child in all the regions
Such as not could by wisdom or by reason
Make of his problem plain exposicion
Who so passyd by he could him not excuse
But the serpent would him felly assail
with a problem make him for to muse
Called of sum men an uncouth deuynaile
Which for to expowne who that did assail
There was none help neither other remedy
By the statute but that he must dye
And for all folk have not knowlegynge
Of this demand what it was in deed
I well reherce it here in my writing
Compendiously that men may it read
First this s^rpent who that list take heed
Was monstrous and spoke against nature
And if it fill that any creature
Man or woman should forth by pass
High or low of all that region
As I said erst there was none other grace
But if he made an exposicion
Of this serpentys froward question
He must dye and make no diffence
The which demand was this in sentence
The serpent axyd what thing may that be
Be or foul when it is forth brought
That has no power stand go nor fle
And afterward if it be well I sought
Gothe first on four or else goth he naught
After by process on three and than on tweyne
And eft again as nature does ordeyne
He goth on three and efte on four ageyn
Also kyndly right nature disposith it so
And in a while it follows in certain
To the matter which that he came fro
He must of kind resort again thereto
And how can not the menynge clerly se
He of this serpent shall deuouryd be
Which edippus full sobre in his intent
Not to rakel or to hasty of langage
But in his heart with great ^uysement
And full demure of look and of visage
Consideryd first this perilous fell passage
Saw well to fore that it was no iape
And full provided that no word ascape
At good leyser with hole mind and memory
Seeing the ernest of this mortal emprise
His life dependynge betwyxt death and victory
This quod he pleynly to deuyse
Is first a child which may not suffice
When it is borne the truth is alday seen
Without help him self to sustene
After on four he naturelly does crepe
For impotence and grene tendrenesse
Noricis can tell that do them keep
But afterward up he does him dress
With his two fete the third to express
Is hand or benche or sopport of sum wall
To hold him up lest he catch a fall
And afterward encresynge of his might
To great age when he does atteyne
Of his nature than he goth up right
Myghtely upon his legs tweyne
Than comyth age his power to restreyne
Crokyd and lame like as men may se
With a staff or potent to make up leggys three
But when feblenesse or sickness do assail
On hondes and fete he must bow and lowte
For crossys potentis may not thanne avail
When lusty age is banysshyd and shet out
Than eft again hereof may be no doubt
With four fete to earth he does return
Fro whens he came there still to soiourne
All came from earth and all to the earth shall
Against nature may no protection
Worldly estatis echon they be mortal
There may no treason make redemption
Who clymeth highest his fall is lowest down
A mean estate is best who could it know
Between high presumynge and bowynge down to low
For who sit highest stand in Iuperdye
Under danger of fortune like for to fall
Mischeef and pouertye as for their pertye
Been lowest brought among these people all
Su^me folk have sugre and su^me taste gall
Salamon therefore myrrour of sapience
Between great richessis and between indigence
Axyd a mean called suffisaunce
To hold him content of compitent dispense
Not to reioise of to great habundaunce
And ever in pouert to send him patience
Sobre with his plentye in scarsnesse none offense
As of grutchynge but between joy and smert
Thank god of all and ever be glad of heart
Earth is the end of every manner man
For the rich with great possession
Death as soon as I reherce can
As does the pore in tribulacion
For death ne makith no division
By singular favor but between both I lech
Of the porest and of him that is most rich
This said problem concludyd in this caas
Which the serpent began slightly to purpose
That when a child is first borne alas
Kind to his dethwarde anon does him dispose
Each day a journey there is none other gloss
Experience can tech in every age
How this world is here but a pilgrymage
This said Edippus first in thebes borne
Sent to a forest deuouryd for to be
Found and brought forth as ye have herd to forne
And after drawing home to his cuntre
Slough his fader so unfortunate was he
Of froward happys following all his live
As this tragedye his fortune shall discriue
But for that he through his high prudence
Unto the serpent declared euerydele
He slough him after by knyghtly violence
More by wisdom than of armure and of stele
Stace of thebes can tell you full well
Which was one cause if yelist to seen
Wherthrough Edippus weddyd has the queen
Called Iocasta princess of that cuntre
His own modre unknown to him both
And though she were right fair upon to se
With this marriage the gods were full wroth
For their aliaunce nature began to loath
That a mother as ye shall understand
Should her son take to be her husbonde
There was therein none conuenience
To be supportyd by kind ne by reason
But if it so be the heavenly influence
Disposid it by the inclinacion
Of sum falls froward constellacion
Caused by saturn or mars the froward sterre
To engendre debate or some mortal werre
In this matter pleyn thus I deem
Of no cunning but of opinion
Though he were crownyd with ceptre and diadem
To regne in thebes the strong mighty town
That some aspecte came from heuyn a down
Unfortunate froward and full of rage
Which against kind denied the marriage
He crownyd was by assent of all the town
Flourynge a ceson by souereynte of pees
And while he held the possession
Sons and daughters he had doutles
The first son called Ethiocles
Polly^enes called was that other
As says bochas the secunde brother
Also he had goodly daughters tweyne
The eldest called was antigone
The secunde named was ymeyne
And both they were right fair unto see
The queen Iocasta might no gladder be
Than to remember when they wexe in age
Her gods had encreasyd their lineage
It was her joy and her felicite
To se her children that were so inly fair
But often of joy there comyth aduersite
And hope vnsured when hope often apaire
Contrarious trust woll gladly their repair
Where falls wenynge in heart is conceived
Through ignorance which many folk have disseyued
What thing in earth is more disceyuable
That when a man supposith verrely
In prosperity for to stand stable
And from his joy is remeuyd suddenly
For where fortune is found to hasty
To trise folk is grievous to endure
For sodeyn chaungis been hateful to nature
Unware woe that comes on gladness
Is unto hertis right passing encumberous
And who has felt his part of wilfulness
Sorrow suynge on is to him odious
And worst of all and most contrarious
Is when estatys highest of renoun
Been from their noblesse suddenly brought down
There is no glory which that shyneth here
That falls fortune can so magnyfie
But when his land brightest is and clear
She can eclipse it with some cloudy sky
Of unware sorrow only of envy
Sees of Edippus an open euydence
Which by his life had experience
Of high noblesse and therewith also
Part importable of great aduersite
His joy ever meynt with full mortal woo
For while he regnyd in thebes the cite
And Iocasta with full great rialtye
Within the cuntre there fill a pestilence
The people enfectynge with his violence
Through all the land and all the region
In every age but most grievously
On them echon that were of that town
The infection spread most specially
And of vengeance the sword most rigerously
Day by day began to byte and karue
Of each estate causynge folk to sterue
Thus began to encrece the mortalite
That every man stood in Iupardye
Of their lives through out the cuntre
So importable was their maladye
That might here the people clepe and cry
Despe^ed so were they of their lives
Wide of all socour and of their preseruatyues
They sought out herbs and spices in their coffres
And began to seek for help and other socouris
The cause enquerynge of prudent philosopheris
And of their most expert deuynourys
Why that the gods with so sharp shourys
Of pestilence and so cruel wise
List them alas so mortally chastyse
But among all in soth this is the caas
There was found one full prudent and full wise
A prophet called Tiresias
Of prophecy having a sovereign price
Which affermyd and said in his a viis
As unto him was showed by miracle
Phoebus him self declarynge the oracle
Cause of this sikenes and these maladies
As the gods plainly have disposyd
And senec writes also in his tragedies
Though the cause be secret and I closyd
Unto the time there be a king disposyd
Which slough his fader and raft him of his life
And has also take his mother to his wife
Till this be done and execute in deed
There may be made no redemption
But pestilence shall multiply and sprede
Ever more and more through out that region
Till unto the time that he be put a down
Fro his crown which was not long agone
His fader slough among his mortal foon
And has his modre weddyd also
Against law and against all right
Till that vengeance upon that crime be do
There shall be werre pestilence and fiyht
Sorrow and great strife and every manner wight
Of vengeance his neighbor shall hate
Brother with brother and blood with blood debate
This all and sum there may be no socoure
Which brought the people in great heaviness
For Tiresia the great dyuynour
By prophecy told them thus express
And at the last by tokenes and witness
Men understood and signs out showing
This pestilence was brought in by the king
And though the people ne gaf no credence
To tiresia ne to his prophecy
The queen iocasta caught an euydence
And in her heart a full great fantasy
Specially when she did aspie
Of king edippus the fete when she se woundyd
How this romour was upon troth ygroundyd
Because also there was a diuinour
Which told to forne that edippus should be
To layus in thebes successoure
Whereby the king the queen and the cite
Fill in great trouble and great aduersite
Well more than I by writynge can report
For there was no thing that might them recou^forte
Full often in the day Iocasta began to sown
King Edippus sobbe cry and weep
In salt terys as they the^ would drown
Death crampisshynge into their heart began crepe
A day compleynynge a night they may not sleep
Cursynge the hour of their natyuyte
That they should live that day for to see
Their mortal chance their dedly adventure
Their fortune also which began on them frown
Impatient and doolfull to endure
Their froward fate with their lokes brown
The king for ire cast away his crown
And bigan to race for constreynt of his pain
Out of his head his woeful iyen tweyne
Day and night he cried after death
Hateful to come in any mannys sight
Most desirous to yield up the breath
Woofull in heart to come in any light
Coorbyd for sorrow feeble to stand up right
And specially in his dedely distress
For dread and shame he daryd in derkenesse
The cruel constrent of his most greuaunce
Was that his sons had him in despite
Which began his sorrow greatly to auaunce
For him to scorn was set all her delight
Was never none that stood in wors plyte
For thus liynge and destitute of chere
Unto the gods he made this prayer
Besechynge them with a full doolfull chere
Upon his woo to have sum compassion
And that they would for to avenge his smerte
Between his sons make a division
Each to bring other to destruction
This was his prayer in substance
That each on other may take vengeance
In years few for their unkindness
They herd his prayer as ye have herd divise
The brethern two through their cursydnesse
Each began other mortally despise
For lack of grace and for falls couetise
Each for his pertye desirous in deed
To fore other to reign and to succeed
And thus these brethren most infortunat
Between them self fill at discenceon
And finally this unkindly debate
Brought all thebes to destruction
zit was there made first a conuencion
By enterchaungynge that each should reign a year
The the other absent to play and come no nere
This was concludyd by their both assent
And by acorde of that region
Pollicenes rood forth and was abssent
Ethiocles took first possession
But when the year by reuolacion
Was come about he falls of his intent
Unto the accord denied to assent
This was a cause of their both strives
Pollicenes thus put out of his right
Till adrastus king was of argyues
Which through all greece gretest was of might
Sent unto Thebes tedeus a knight
His sone in law to trete of this matere
And the cause finally to lere
Wherethrugh the king called Ethiocles
Would condescende of truth and of reasn
To stynt werre and to cherisshe pees
Aftyr the accord and compas^cion
Up to deliver thebes that mighty town
Unto his brother which absent was without
Now that his year was fully comme about
But he was false and frowerdly began varye
Ethiocles from his conuencion
For which adrastus no longer would tarry
When tedeus had made relacion
But called anon throughoute his region
All the worthy both nere and ferre^
Against thebes forto begin a werre
For this cause like as ye shall lere
Pollicenes to force his party
I weddyd had the kings daughter dear
I mean adrastus flower of cheualrie
When tedeus did him certefie
Touching the answer of Ethiocles
And of his truth how he was recheles
False of his promise and cursedly forsworn
For to his truth none aduertence had he
Neither to the accord that was made beforne
Touching the delyueraunce of thebes the cite
But who that list the story clearly se
Of these two brethern and their discencion
And adrastus lay tofore the town
And tideus through his high prowes
Fought by the way goinge on message
And how of greece all the worthiness
With king adrastus went in this viage
And of the mischeef that fill in that passage
For lack of water till that ysiphile
Norissh of ligurgus so fair upon to se
Thought Tideus to find out a river
She that did in fairness so excelle
Neither how the serpent most ougly of his chere
Of king Ligurgus the child slough at the well
Neither how amphiorax fill adoun to hell
All to declare me semyd it was no need
For in the syege of thebes ye may it read
The story hole and made there is mention
Of either pertye their puissaunce and their might
And how adrastus lay to fore the town
And how they met every day in fight
And Tideus theus the noble famous knygght
So renomyd in actys morciall
Was slain alas as he faught on the wall
And how the brethern met among the prees
Like two tigrys or lions that were wode
With sharp sperys this it is doutles
Euerich of them shed others heart blood
This was their fine and thus with them it stood
Save at their festys called funeral
There fill a marueyle which I tell shall
When they were brent into ashes deed
Of their envy there fill a full great wondre
Among the brondes and the coals read
High in the eire the smokes went a sondre
The one to one party and that other yonder
To declare the story me list not feyne
The great hatred that was between them tweyne
Thus for their Ire and false discencion
All the lords and all the chivalry
Were slain of greece and also of the town
And rote of all mine ^uctour list not lie
Was falls aliaunce and fraternall envy
And cheef ground with all the surplusage
Who search aright was unkindly marriage
The queen Iocasta felt her pert of pain
To se her children each of them sle other
Her son her lord blind on his iyen tweyne
Which to his sonys was fadre and also brother
Fortune would it should be none other
Also parca^ susters which been in noumbre three
Span so the thride at her natyuyte
Also when Iocasta stood thus disconsolate
And saw of Thebes the subversion
The cuntre distroyed was and disolate
The gentle blood shed of that region
Without comfort or consolacion
Thought she might be no more appeired
But of all hope fully dispeyred
Trist and heavy pensif and spoke no word
Her sorrows old and new she began aduert
Took the sword of him that was her lord
With which Edippus smote Layus to the heart
She to fenysshe all her peynes smerte
And fro the body her soul to deuyde
Roof her self thurghoute every side
She weary was of her wolull life
Seeing of fortune the great froowardnesse
How her diffame and slander was so rife
And of Edippus the great wretchidnesse
Also of her sons the great unkindness
All these things weyed on her so sore
For distress she that list to live nomnre
Bouchas writes the fairness
Constreynt of sorrow caused it to fade
The famous light also of her noblesse
And all the clerenesse of her days glade
With unware armies she was so over lade
Of verrey anguyssh that her self did hate
So inly contrary disposid was her fate
Thus death deuourith with his bitter gall
Joy and sorrow avoid of all mercy
And with his dart he makyth down to fall
Rich and pore them markynge suddenly
His unware stroke smyteth vndifferently
From him refusing favor and all mede
Of all estates he takes so little head
Better is to dye than live in wretchidnesse
Better is to dye than ever live in pain
Better is an end than dedely heaviness
Better is to dye than ever in woe complain
And where as myscheef does at folk complain
By woeful constreynt of long contynuaunce
Better it is to dye than live in such greuaunce
Takith ensample hereof and a preef
Of king Edippus that was so long agoo
Of queen Iocasta that felt so great myscheef
And of their children remember also
Which ever lyuyd in envy sorrow and woe
Fortune alas during al their days
Was so froward to them at all assaies
Touching Edippus process find I none
What end he made in conclusion
Save Bochas write how the king Creon
Cosyn and heir by succession
Exilyd him cheyned far out of the town
Where he induryd mischeef sorrow and dread
Till antropos vntwinyd his lives threde
Lenuoye
IN this tragedy three things ye may se
The pride of Iabyn and false presumpcion
Of queen Iocasta the great aduersite
Of king edippus the enclinacion
To vicis all and the deuysion
Of the two brethern pleynly us to assure
Kyngdoms divided may no while endure
Omne regnum in se^ diuisum desolabitur
For who saw ever kingdom or cuntre
Stand in quiet of possession
But if there were right peace and equity
And Just accord without dissencion
Void of vntreuth and falls collusion
Plainly declarynge by ensample and by scripture
Kingdoms deuidyd may no while endure
Sees here ensaumple of thebes the cite
And how that noble mighty region
Through their froward falls duplicite
With werre were brought to their distruccion
Their promise broken and their covert treson
Showed by her armies impossible to recure
Kyngedomes diuidyd may no while endure
Pryncis princessys which have the souereynte
Over the people and dominacion
If ye list long live in felicite
Cheryssh your subgettis do noon extorcion
And aduertyse of wisdom and of reason
As this tragedy does to you discure
Kingdoms diuidyd may no while endure
How Atreus king of messene wrought against his brother Thiestes slew his
three children disme^bryd them pecys made Thieftes to ete of their flessh and
drink of their blood
bOchas the poet auctour of this book
Him purposynge to gydre and compyle
Diverse stories anon his pen he took
Him remembrynge within a little while
In this chapitle began direct his style
To write the storye and hye compendious
A forne all other of duke theseus
Lord of athenys a famous great cite
Right strong and mighty on every side
But at his back bochas did one se
Which cried loud and bad he should abide
Bochas quod he fro the me list not hyde
My woeful case ne in no wise spare
My pitous compleynt to the to declare
I am thiestes besprent all with weeping
Drounyd in teers as thou may well see
Sometime son of the mighty king
Philistines and born also parde
Of queen pellop^a excellent of beute
And for thou art desirous to endite
Of people unhappy and their woe to write
My will is this anon that thou proceed
Turn thy style and take thy pen blyue
Leave theseus and take of him non head
But first my tragedy that thou discryue
For I suppose that in all thy live
That thou saw neuir a thing more dolorous
More unhappy more frowerde ne pitous
Than is alas my mortal adventure
Incomperable the sorrow surmountynge
Of queen iocasta most woeful criature
Or of edippus his faat euyr complaining
For my complaynt has none ending
But lastith ever and berith me witness
No woe resemblyth unto my heuinesse
And with that word john bochas still stood
Full soberly to give him audience
And in the place demurely abood
To here the substance of his mortal offense
Which thus bigan to show the sentence
O john quoth he I pray the take good head
My woe to write that men may it read
Alas my brother rote of unkindness
Attreus called of reason sours and well
And fynder out of treason and falsenesse
And all other in fraud he does precelle
Whose covert hate is more than I can tell
I supposing of verry innocence
In him no malice disceit nor none offense
But as brother should a brother trust
I trustyd him of heart will and thought
By apparen^e none other cause I wiste
For in his person I supposyd naught
That ever he could so false a thing have wrought
But who may su^ner another man disceyue
Than he in whom no malice men conceive
I demyd of him as of my true brother
w^^ynge he had feythfull ben to me
I saw no sign ne I knew none other
In him supposing no duplicite
But woe alas who might it ever be
Or who did ever in any story find
Blood unto blood to be so unkind
I woll pass over to tell the worthynesse
Touching the estatys of our progenytours
Of our kynred and the great nobl^sse
I tell no thing neither of our predecessors
Neither of my youth how passyd ben the flowers
I l^ue all this and unto mind call
The wretchidnesse that I am in fall
My brother fond a falls occasion
Against me and bigan a cause feyne
To banysshe me out of our region
And bigan at me of hatred so disdeyne
Upon me affermynge in certain
In our kingdom which called is myssene
I should have leyen by his wife the queen
This he compassyd full falsely of malice
Him self well knowing that it was not so
Ever found unkind and his auyse
Not like my brother but like my dedely foo
And to encrese great percell of my woo
By long process in his entencion
He ymagenyd my destruction
Whereof the people were full glad and light
Thurghout myssene that mighty region
At my resorting finding every wight
Nedy of heart and hole affection
Me to resort into that noble town
And none so ready by signs out showing
To make me chere in soth as was the king
There is no damage in comperyson
That may be lykenyd by no resemblaunce
To feyned truth and simulacion
When fraud is hyd with a fair countenance
Pretendynge truth outward by disseyuaunce
And underneath of most false intent
Of doubleness darith the serpent
As under flowers is shrowdyd the dragon
For to betraisshe by sodeyne violence
Such folk as have no suspeccion
But truly mean in their pure innocence
Till they be caught dispurueyed of diffence
As a fisshe with bayte of falls plesaunce
The hoke not seen to bring him to myschaunce
Thus semblably at my home coming
I was resceyuyd with every circumstaunce
Like as half heir and brother to the king
And he pretendynge as by countenance
That he had so inly greatly plesaunce
Of my repair of truth he told so
For reioysinge said he would go
And his chief cause was falls couetise
Touching this thing which he did on me feyne
And yet this kingdom truly to deuyse
Should have be depertyd of right between us tweyne
But against truth he did so ordeyne
Me to besile out of that region
Him self alone to have possession
Yet in his heart he cast another wyle
To my undoing and disolacion
To the place where he did me exile
Under a shadow of falls collusion
To make a manner reuocacion
Of bretherhede showing a pretense
Me to resort again to his presence
To be acceptyd as a brother should
With full accoorde still with him forto abide
All iniures of which before I told
On either pertye foryete and set a side
That no thing after should our love deuyde
But of one will and one entencion
Led all our life without division
Unto his gods to do sum obseruaunce
For this accord and humble sacrifise
Made his ministres with feithfull attendaunce
To wait on me in all their best wise
It nedith not to tell ne diuyse
Neither by writynge in books for to set
Half the joy he made when we met
First how friendly he did me enbrace
Of hertely gladness within his arms tweyne
And how for joy the terys on his face
Full enteerly began distyll and reyne
That for my pertye he ^oude not me restreyne
But that I must of friendship fraternall
Weep as did he in his estate riall
The wily wolf that cast him to devour
The sely lamb which can no diffence
Ne none help him self to socoure
So feeble he is to make resistance
Which demyth truth of falls appearance
What wondre is it the fraud not conceyuyd
Though such lambys unawarely be disceyuyd
Though that roses at mydsomer be full sote
Yet underneath is hyd a full sharp spyne
Sum fressh flowers have a full bitter rote
And lothsum gall can also sugre undermine
In dreadful storms the su^ne among does shine
And wnder a shadow of feyned frenlihede
There is no friendship so perilous to dread
Thus remembrynge the feithfull words stable
Of my brother showed unto me
At our metynge the kissing amyable
The assuryd couenauntes at our fraternity
But often time men may behold and se
That lilyes grown among these netles thick
And flower delice in mids these wedys wicke
Thus while I restyd in the kings house
No thing aduertynge his dedely cruelty
His old hatred was so venymous
And so odyble to distroye me
Him self to avenge he took my children ^hree
And sikerly is it not a wonder
He cut their throtes with a knyfe a sundre
For he thought that it did him good
Them to dismembre into pecis small
And in a vessel for to gadre their blood
While they lay still and lokyd on him pale
This was his deed in a desert vale
Withinne a cave that no man should aspye
Treason conspired of his false tirannye
This was the substance of his sacrifise
^o sle my children and make their hertis blede
I trow the gods thereof did agrise
Of his false offringe when they took head
He did their members after roste and sede
And with this viande most abominable
He made me to be served at the table
In covert cruses also thus it stood
To staunche my thrust through his cruel ve^geau^ce
He made me unknow drink their blood
Was not this thing to gods displesaunce
Yis I dare say for by demonstraunce
Upon this deed without more obstacle
The son in heuyn showed a miracle
Which sore agrysyd might not behold
With his bemys thereon to cast his sight
For displesaunce his cleernes began witholde
And for vengeance to withdraw his light
The day tournynge for horror into night
When he shone brightest in his mydday spear
Shroudyd his face and would not appear
But I alas upon this caas horrible
That could not ymagyne neither think
On any matter that was so odible
Get their flessh th^^r blood also did I drink
Which so sore does to mine heart synke
That I may not touching this adventure
The circumstaunce for constreynt discure
It nedith not me to make rehersaile
Touching mine exyll of all manner things
Of diverse sorrows that me did assail
My woeful sighs ne my grievous wepynges
Neither upon nyghtes my dolorous wakinges
My pouert neither how I stood in dread
To lose my life whereof bochas take heed
And remember all the cyrcumstaunce
If ever thou saw of high or low degree
More contrary / or more unhappy chauncis
Than thou herd remembered here of me
Weye in balauncis / my sorrows let se
If any sorrow or myscheef vnrecuryd
May countirpeyce to that I have enduryd
Mine enfortunes I fond them ay so fell
Without favor and socour dispurueyed
My brother on me ever so cruel
That I full often desired to have dyed
For to this day my sprite has be conveyed
With sorrow and woo deuoide of all refuge
Wherefore I pray / o bochas be my judge
And in thy writing leave not me behind
Neither in thy book / that thou not disdeyne
Among the folk / that thou have me in mind
Which that for sorrow weep / weyle / and pleyn
And thus T^estes rehersynge all his pain
Like as he would him self on pecis rende
Made unto bochas of his tale an end
How Atreus accusyd him self of murdre and his brother upon auoutrye done with
Europa the queen
aTreus after with a full pale chere
And of envy full deed in his visage
And unto John bochas began aproche nere
Like as he had be fallen in a rage
And furiously abreyde in his langage
How may this be / that like a man were wode
^^stes has his venym sow abrood
And like a ribaude falsely me accusyd
Not withstondynge that I full clearly se
Mine infortunys / which may not be refusyd
So sore alas / they work against me
And though T^estes / falls and untrue be
And unto the bochas with a face pale
Against me has forgyd here a tale
Which in effect shall be found untrue
If I have my compleynt to declare
For I purpose to tell a tale new
Fro point to point / and for no man to spare
How he was ground and root of all my care
And ever like as it is befall
Reherce the beginning of my sorrows all
Sumtyme when I regnyd in myssene
Of age lusty flourynge in my fresshenesse
With my wife Europa that was queen
Most renomyd that time of fairness
Tiestes than as ground of all falsnesse
As a traitor his time did aspye
Through his false fraud and flaterye
Cumpassyd a mean within my cite
By sleighty wyles that were incomperable
To corrupt my wives chastity
My bed defowlynge a thing intolerable
And to the gods verry abominable
Using the queen to his flesshly plesaunce
Till unto time that contynuaunce
She by him had sons two or three
Echon brought forth in falls anoutrye
Demynge that they had be
Mine own children ^yll that I did aspye
How that this swyne through his false lecherye
This Tiestes / after Europa
Lay by his daughter called Pellopia
And by process forth a child she brought
^allyd Egistus / which when he came to age
As seyth bochas / full much treason he wrought
For by his malice and his great outrage
Destroyed was all hoole the lynage
Of Tantalus which by his living
In frigia reigned as lord and king
But this Egistus of whom I spoke to forne
Falsely bygoten mine auctour says the same
Of Pellopia anon as he was borne
To hyde the sclaunder / and also the defame
Of Tiestes / and also for to save his name
When he was but a day of age
He was outcast to bestys full savage
To be deuouryd the story is well couth
A mylche goot / god list for him purueye
To fostre him in his tender youth
He night and day lyenge by her side
Within the forest thus he did abide
Unto the time he began grow in age
Than to the court he holds his passage
Wherefore o bochas of heart I pray the
Which of these stories is most terrible
Of Edippus ^ Iocasta / or of me
Tel^ on anon if it be possible
Which of their sorrows is most penyble
Of theban brethern most full of woo and tene
Or of us tweyne brethren of myssene
I am a know as for my party
Of vengeance I did a cruel deed
I slough his children of malice and envy
And rostyd them when that they were deed
Only because if thou list take heed
That he bygate them / as rote of all this strife
Upon Europa / which that was my wife
Such hateful things each man should loath
Which aparteyneth to murdre and treason
Thus may I say we been unhappy both
He first by trespass of fornycacion
Done by the queen within my region
And I desclaundryd on that other side
Of hasty vengeance to be an homycide
My bed he defoulyd by his auoutrye
To god and man a thing most detestable
And I of malice and falls malencolie
Slough his children and served them at the table
Thus enterchaungynge if it be comendable
Each was desirous through our unhappy chance
Upon other for to do vengeance
Our great hatred most odious found at all
Our cruel dedys wrought on outher side
Senec rehersyth them in especial
In his tragedies / and there he does deuyde
Our complayntys / our malice / and our pride
Our fatal end in sorrow and myscheef fined
When antrapos our lives threde has twyned
When John bochas fully had aspyed
Of these two brethren the accusacions
And how they had maliciously replied
Each against other in their discencions
He began dully to here their mocions
Put up his pen and wrote not more a word
Of their furye neither of their falls discord
Lenuoy
THis tragedye shewyth a figure
A manner of image and also likeness
How contrary it is unto nature
Blood unto blood to show unkindness
This woeful story can bear full well witness
All such debatis been as ye shall find
Hateful to god and contrary unto kind
For there is no more dredefull adventure
Than in kynrede to find frowardness
Neither no damage more perilous to endure
Than in frenship when there is strangeness
A manner pertye by example I dare express
To se the tree debate again the rynde
To god were hateful and contrary unto kind
Every be and every creature
Loves his semblable of kyndly right I guess
And when one truth tweyn hertys assure
Vndepartyd of verrey perfightnesse
It were a visious froward cursydnesse
Their love to knyt to louse or unbind
Hateful to god and contrary unto kind
Princes princessis do your besy cure
From you to avoid strif / fraud / and doubleness
Remember you upon the unhappy cure
Of these two brethren and their wretchydnesse
And of their both malicious wilfulness
And how their stryues / have this well in mind
To god was hateful and contrary unto kind
Of duke Theseus and Adryane that saved his life in the Cave / and how he like
a forsworn man forsook her and weddyd fair phedra which afterward slough her
silfe
aThenes su^tyme wha^ it was in his flowers
Was called norice of philosopheris wise
Princess of poets and expert oratoures
Su^me of all sciencis as clerkis can devise
Whens all cu^nynge most clearly did arise
Named of Greece the lantern and the light
Which through all earth shed his bemys bright
With noble titles which been out of noumbre
In every coost his renoun did shine
The fame thereof was clipsid with none vmbre
All other scolys it did so enlumyne
For in that cite pleynly to determyne
Of the un artys / as dou^ from one head spring
There ran out ryuers and stremys of all cu^nynge
These sciencis were called liberal
Only of fredam fraunchise and liberte
For of a storke that were prouyd thrall
There should no branch study in that cite
^ut the ylke blood that were found fre
Both by descent and syneall high noblesse
There to ^^oleye should have interesse
This cite was sacryd to myne^^e
For their wisdom and their sapience
Of mercury the festys they observe
For rethoryk and for eloquence
And mighty mars yaue them enfluence
With glad aspe^tys their pertye to amend
Noblesse of knyghthode the clergy to defend
This town was nobled by title of other things
And most glorious / rekened in that age
By succession of Dukes and of kings
Among which duke theseus by lynage
Son of Egistus full fressh in his courage
E^cellynge all / of prudence and manhede
That ever did the crown there possede
For to that cite through his high noblesse
In their defencis / such trust / such affiaunce
He yaue to them by his expert prowess
Of his tryumphes so great habundaunce
And specially their renoun to auaunce
He made them free their trewage to let
Against Mynos the mighty king of Crete
For by his force the story is well couth
Them to fraunchise and all that regyon
The mynataur he slough in tender youth
And afterward he of devotion
To aquite him self like a chaumpion
Thereof made solemp^e sacrifise
To Jupiter in most humble wise
And a Theater called Maraton
Duke theseus had the victory
After he went to Colchos with Jason
Cheef of counseyle as made is memory
And by process to augment his glory
With hercules his brother to conueye
Against amazones he went to werreye
Conqueryd them his manhood was well seen
His force / his noblesse in that mortal strife
And after that Ipolita the queen
This theseus took unto his wife
And for his brother he laid in iuperde his life
Duke Pirotheus when he did undertake
The Centaures to outraye for his sake
This centaures poetys specify
And s^ruyus makyth mention
How they were sumtyme engendryd on askye
When first their fader called yrion
Was enammored full many a day goon
Upon Juno because she was so fair
Gouernesse and gods of the air
This yrion was her secretary
And for her fairness and excellent bewtye
Louyd her full hot al be it she was contrary
To his desire / bochas read and ye may se
Him to delude he writes how that she
Her self transformed / as she that might and could
Into the likeness of an heavenly cloud
This yrion plainly supposing
It was her self and euene thus she wrought
The ^loude enbrasynge without more taryenge
Of his folly the gods there he sought
And wttheir medli^g between them forth they brough
The Centaures thise bestys marvelous
Which of nature been found monstrous
Half man / half horse depertyd thus in tweyne
And wonderful by their description
Of falls malice did them self ordeyne
On Pirotheus to make inuacion
And him to put out of possession
Of his wife called ypodamen
And her to rauysshe maugre all his men
There were of them an hundrith as in noumbre
Swift as the wind in their course renynnge
Which of malice cast them to encoumbre
Duke perotheus the day of his wedding
And to rauissh his wife at their cummynge
If for his party there were no defense
Against their power to make recistence
But theseus list not to delay
Pirotheus his brother to defend
First the centaures knightly he did outraie
So mortally they durst not him offend
After the conquest to hell they descend
Duke pirothe and worthy th^^^^s
Maugre the daungere of (...) cerberus
There they rauisshyd in their mortal tene
Through their knyghthode if ye lift to lere
Dispyte of pluto / proserpina the queen
Which of jupiter was the daughter dear
And pirotheus fond first the manner
Of wilful force through his high renoune
Realms to conquer and hold possessioun
But by writynge sothely of ouyde
He plainly tellith how duke theseus
Arestyd was in hell and must abide
By the force of cruel cerberus
And pluto was to him contrarius
Till pirotheus to find a relees
The case declared unto hercules
Which of his knyghthode a remedy fond
To help his friend did his besy pain
First by his prowess cerberus he bond
At hell gatis with a treble cheyne
And of his manhood he did so ordeyne
Duke theseus from danger to discharge
Maugry pluto for to goo at large
They were in armies brethern both tweyne
Louyd as brethern both in werre and pees
That neither could unto other feyne
Their lif to iupardye and put them self in prees
And both as brethern were called hercules
To signifye / poets can well tell
This name in conquest all other does excel
By old time they that were peerles
For their nobles in diverse regions
All they for manhood were named hercules
Such as were noisyd for fa^ous champions
Tigres to daunt borys and lions
And renomyd among them euerichon
Bochas affermith that theseus was oon
First as I said by his knyghtly traueyle
When athenes stood in division
Among them self by werre and bataile
By his wisdom and his discrecion
To set accord within that noble town
Them that were exilyd and stood in no certain
He of his knyghthode made them resort again
He yaf them laws whereby they should them gye
Noble statutes foundyd of reason
Set among them so prudent policy
In their living that no dissencion
Should arise by none occasion
Among them self in high or low estate
Prouidynge ever that there were no debate
Thus bigan the cite encreas and multiply
To wex famous of wisdom and riches
There spronge the well first of philosophy
There first of knyghthode rose the high nobles
By theseus bochas berith witness
Thus things two like as it is found
Clergy and law did there habounde
For to set the cite in quiet
He made peace through all that region
And of knyghthode he manly did mete
The cruel tiraunt that called was creon
Maugre him / made restitucion
Of lords bones that were at thebes slain
To the ladies / whereof they were full feign
Thus through greece anon his renoune spradde
His knightly fame bigan greatly multiplye
And long in joy thus his life he ladde
While that fortune list him magnifye
But ay her gladness is meynte with sum envy
For she froward list no more soiourne
With theseus but bygan her face turn
Awey fro him wexe peruerce and froward
Of his glory ungoodly began to double
Down from her whele she made go bakwarde
Of his good name she began the feders pulle
When his nobles was highest at fulle
I mean the full of his felicite
There folowyd an ebb of great aduercite
And more ever her frowardly to aquyte
His vnhappis rehersynge one by one
One the first as bochas list to endyte
Was when he lay in crete among his fone
And out of prison should in to greece gone
Repeirynge homewarde and him self withdraw
The minataure when he had slawe
The first emprise that he undertook
Was when he ascapyd the importable pain
Of mynatoures like as seith my book
And with him had the kings daughters tweyne
That he of malice falsely list disdeyne
Against adriane which that did him save
From the death when he lay in the cave
Should have be slain had not her socour be
In his repeire he took thereof non head
He left her alone in great aduersite
Within an isle in mischeef sorrow and dread
And faier phedra with him he did led
Weddyd her like a forsworn man
Thus with untruth his mischeef first began
How phedra qu^t her the story is well know
In his absence bochas wrytith thus
When that she within a lytill throw
Louyd against kind her son ypolitus
But he to her was contrarious
Would not assente to so foul a deed
For shame he fled and pereell also for dread
To his fader for him did accuse
^^ ye to forne have the story seyne
And for he did her company refuse
He went away and came never again
For ye have herd how that he was slain
Within acha^ through his unhappy chance
And how phedra through mischeef and vengeance
Slough her self against all womanhede
Here in this book to fore as I you told
Of which thing when theseus took head
Thought it was vengeance for his offense old
For he not quit him like as he was behold
To adriane which should have be his wife
By whose socoure he scapyd with his life
This infortune and this unhappy chance
Was to his nobles full contrarious
The death also was to him a vengeance
Of his son called ipolitus
For sorrow of whom this duke theseus
With salt teres sore bygan to plain
And the exequies of the ilke tweyne
I trow also it did him sore grieve
Duke pirotheus when he saw deed
Slain with a best and might not releue
King orchus hounde which had a treble head
Whoos teeth orrible of his blood were read
Which infortune when he began behold
Unto the day he felt his heart cold
And for to reken the great wretchydnesses
The unhappy chauncis that fill him in his life
Among all his other great distresses
Was none so mortal and so full of stryf
As was when he yaf credence to his wife
Phedra called which an entencion
Cumpassyd untruly an accusacion
Upon Ipolitus of hatred and envy
Because he would not do so great offense
As for to assente to her lecherye
Therefore of death he felt the violence*
And for his fadre to sone yaf credence
Bochas forbad husbendes all their lives
Without preef not leave to sone their wives
Neither be to hasty tales for to here
Of flaterers in chaumbre ne at the table
Forgers of lesyngess mine auctour does well preue
To abide with lords that they be not able
Hereon he makyth a chapytle full natable
And of his writing this was the cause why
That princes should examyne each party
Of wisdom also and of discrecion
Without a preef not be perciall
For to a prince it is confusion
If bitwene parties he be not found egall
Caused many one for to have a fall
God suffrid such not long to continue
Withdrawith their grace and hyndreth their fortune
Thus theseus for his hastynes
His hap his grace distressyd day by day
The fame appallyd of his worthiness
And froward fortune also in a wait lay
For his defautes to hyndre him if she may
Cast she would his nobles diasuaunce
And than his kyngedome by disobeisaunce
From him withdrawth honor and reverence
Full frowardly through all his region
They of athenes by cruel violence
Fill against him in rebellion
That he was feign to fle out of that town
Thus has fortune derkyd the brightness
Of all his noblesse and cast him in destresse
This was the end by great cantrariouste
Of Theseus after his days glade
When the fressh flower of old felicite
Fortune adverse / made them for to fade
Each thing must bow when it is ouerlade
Worshippes and honors when the brightest shine
With unware chaunges than rathest do declyne
Lenuoye
THe unsure gladness the joy transitory
The unstable surenesse the transmutacions
The cloudy brightness the false eclipsid glory
Of erthely princes which have possessions
Monarchies and dominacions
Their sodeyn change declares to us all
Their pompous sugar is meynt with bitter gall
This blind goddess in her consistory
With her plesaunce medleth discencions
After triumphs / conquest and victory
Reueth from kings their ceptris and their crowns
Troubles the people with falls rebellions
See these dukes which from their whele been fall
All wordly sugre is meant with sum gall
This tragedy makes momerie
Of dukes tweyne and of their high renouns
And of their love write a great history
And how they conqueryd diverse regions
Gouernyd cites / cuntrees / and also touns
Tyl^ fortune their prowess did appalle
To show their sugre was meynt with sum gall
Princis princessis see how deceptorie
Been all these worldly reuolucions
And how fortune in her reclinatorie
With her triacle temperith falls poisons
So marvelous been her confeccions
Of frowardness she woll what so bifall
E^^r with her sugre of custum tempre gall
Here bochas writes against them that yeuethe hasty credence to liers and
flaterers
IN this Chaptre Bochas in sentence
Repreueth and blames not only princes
But all them that ouerlightly yeueth credence
To every tale and fable which is
R^po^tyd unto them for sothfastnysse
And list no thing do / as it were dew
To prove the troth where it be falls or trwe
All though so be in every manner age
Folkys been diverse of conditions
To turn plie and change in their courage
To outher party with sodeyn mocions
And for to bow by transmutacions
With every wind as done the unstable leuys
Which hang / in trees / in forestes and in greues
But of all chaungis that change is most to dread
And most feerfull is that variaunce
When that princis which may the people led
Been found unstable in their governance
For their noblesse and their high punissaunce
Assures them by a manner of form
What ever them list to aco^plissh and to perform
To common profit they most may avail
When they been ruled by wisdom and reason
And to the people they may most disauayle
When they lack wit and discrecion
Thus bitwene tweyne in every region
The people draws who that can discern
To good or badde as princis them govern
They may not be to hasty ne to sodeyn
But do all thing by good auysement
Keep them from tunges that pertyd been on tweyne
Not be to hasty to give no judgment
And of folks when they been absent
Leave no tales / neither give no credence
Till that the pertye may come to evidence
Sumtyme has hapnyd how that slaw credence
Has in su^me be found full noyous
But hasty credence I dare say in sentence
A thousand foolde is more perilous
For vnauysyd / all have is odious
For have full often / for lack of reason
Of much people has been destruction
There is no damage that men can purpose
More to be dred nor more lamentable
Than a prince his eeris to unclose
To every tale and every fable
It is a token their hertes be not stable
When they to flaterers their eers don apply
Namely to such that can well forge and lie
Folks be diverse sum falls sum true
In diverse studies done their business
Sum can study and find out tales new
And sum for lucre can maintene well falsnesse
And hold up quarrels against rightwysnesse
Pretendynge truth under a falls entente
To hyndre folks which that been innocente
(...) to suppose it were a great folly
(...) folks should in their opynion
Speak or pronounce all on one party
Or hold one way in their entencion
For semblably as there is a division
Of ^oragis of high or low degree
So is there truly a great diversity
In rehersaile or report of a thing
For to his party each man is favorable
S^ man can say well in all his rehersynge
S^ man is double and sum man dissayuable
S^ men say true and sum be variable
^^^^fore a prince of right as it does seem
Should well examyne before or that he deem
For there is noon more dreadful pestilence
Than a tunge that can flatere a fage
For with his cursyd crabbyd violence
He enf^^^^th folk of every age
Woo to tunges froward of their langage
And woo to tunges falls furious and wode
Which of no person never can say good
Bochas rehersith it is right well sittynge
Than every man other do comende
And say the best alwey in reportynge
For in well saying no man may offend
Where men say well god woll his grace send
After men be / men must this pris vpreyse
Like their meritis allow them or despreise
But where a thing is utterly unknow
Let no man there be hasty of sentence
For rightful iuges sittynge on arowe
Of their wisdom and of their high prudence
Will of truth have first su^me evidence
I mean such as gouernyd be by grace
Or any dome forth by their lippis pace
A prince should assemble things tweyne
Within him self before full prudently
Shet up his domes bitwyxe locks tweyne
One of the soul / reason for that party
Prudence chosen / and right for the body
And between them both or he yaue a sentence
To counseyll call / truth and good conscience
First to considre with every circumstaunce
And diligently do their on his labor
Of discrecion to take the balaunce
And first weye out who is the accusoure
And whether that he for falnesse or favor
In his process list to proceed
Hereof a prince must of right take heed
He must also considre by and by
What that he is which to him is accusyd
And whether the accusour be friend or enmy
Or whether he shall be accept or refusyd
In his actis thus must before be musyd
And whether he be by report of his name
A man well norsyd or sclaundred by diffame
If theseus thus had been auysyd
And consideryd of reason the meanere
He had not so hastily deuysyd
His sons death like as ye shall lere
For if there had assembled be in fere
In his person prudence and reason
He should have seen in his discrecion
By knowelegynge of long experience
Of his wife the great unsteadfastness
Which through her froward compassynge eloquence.
Was ready ever to bring folk to distress
And in his writing bochas berith witness
Of their nature wymen can flater and fage
And be sumtyme to copious of their langage
Also of wisdom duke theseus
Should have consideryd before in his intent
How that his son called Ipolitus
Of all uncleanness was found ever Innocent
And how that he custum / made his went
Into forestys during his young age
To hunte at beestys which that were savage
Rennynge on foot as ye shall understand
On hillis valeys to eschew idelnesse
Modre of vicis with his bow on hand
Dyane to serve of hunting cheef goddess
Sumtyme to hawk he did his business
Also unto fisshynge greatly he was applied
So that his youth was never unoccupied
Thus he lyuyd in wodys solitarye
And of venus despisyd the seruyse
Among wymen he would never tarry
Their felawship he did alwey despise
For he demyd by sentence of the wise
Who so touchith pytch by assay men may se
It fails not he shall defoulyd be
Qui tangit picem et c^.
Ipolitus saw well this thing before
Kept him at large from such contrariouste
His grene youth he would not have it lore
To be defoulyd for lack of chastity
For he lived ever in virginyte
And never did Bochas will not varye
No thing that was unto god contrary
Thus of intent he kept his body clean
During his life both in thought and deed
Whose mother was ypolita the queen
Of amazones in ouide ye may read
But woe alas that theseus took head
For a tale of phedra full of gyle
Without gylte / his to exile
After whose death / su^me poetis seyn
How that Dyana for his chastity
Restoryd him unto life again
By Esculapius / and yaue him liberty
In her forestes to hunte and to goo free
For which restorynge / as write Ouideus
As twyes a man / men call him verbius
M. de transformatis.i. bis vir
But bochas here I not what he does mean
Makith in his book an exclamacion
Against wymen that pite is to seen
Seith how their life their generation
Been of nature double of condition
And callyth them also diverse and unstable
Beestys resembling that been insaciable
He meneth of wymen been borne in Crete
And no thing of them that dwell in this cuntre
For wymen here all doubleness they let
And have no tatch of mutabilite
They loue^o chaungis ne no duplicite
For their husbondes in causes small or great
What so ever they say they cannot counterplete
Blessed be god that them has made so meke
So humble / and feerfull of their conditions
For though men would cause and matter seek
Ayens their paciens to find occasions
They have refusyd all contradiccions
And them submyttyd through their governance
Oonly to meekness and womanly suffraunce
I speak not of one I speak of all
That been professyd unto lowlynesse
They may have mouths but langege have they non
All true husbondes can bear hereof witness
For weddyd men I dare full well express
That have assayed and had experience
Best can record of wifly patience
For as longith to men to be sturdy
And sumwhat froward as of their nature
Right so can wymen suffer patiently
And all wrongs womanly endure
Men should attempt no manner creature
And namely wymen their meekness for to preue
Which may well suffer while no man do them greu^
Every thing resortith to his kind
As bochas writith sumtyme of the year
And yet who serchith by process he shall find
That truth and virtue may never fade of chere
For rightwysnesse woll alwey shine clear
Truth falsnesse in what they have to done
They may no while assemble in one person
Feer and flaterie they been contrary
They may togydre hold soiour
Neither symplesse which that can not varye
May never accord. with a baratoure
Neither Innocence with a losemour
Neither chastise cannot her self apply
Her to confourme unto no rebaudie
Ar^ mutat naturam
By the ordinance set in their courage
And each man follows his condition
As of the stock the fruit has the tariage
Pilgrims may go full ferm their passage
But I dare say how far that ever they goo
There but su^me tarrage of that they came fro
Bochas makes an introduccion
In this chaptre of high noblesse
That princis have in their possession
And by a manner laughing does express
How for to set them in great sekernesse
They have seruauntis upon them abidynge
And men of arms day and night awaytinge
That no man may enter but if he have license
The froward ports stondinge at the gate
Put men abak by sturdy violence
It were full hard against them to debate
Their wat^ his kept erly and also late
And them to assure on nyghtes when they sleep
The chaumberleyns their doris streitly keep
Men assignyd their metis to assaye
To taste their wynes lest there were treason
Such mortal dread these lords do affraye
So is there surenesse meynt with suspecion
Who fedyth him gladly that ferith him of poison
But pore folk fraunchisyd from such dread
Such as god them sent with mirth they them feed
But poetis that write tragedies
Their compleynynge is all of high estatis
Rehersinge ever the pitous Iuperdus
Their sodeyn chaungys and their woeful fatis
Their divisions and their mortal debatis
And ever conclude their dytees who so can read
High estatis stand ay most in dread
And ground and rote of all this mortal trouble
As Bochas writes and berith witness
Been these liers with their tunges double
Them self ay forsinge truth to oppress
With whom flaterie is a cheef maystresse
And worst of all to their dreadful sentence
Is when princis been hasty of credence
Hasty credence is rote of all error
A froward stepmoder of all good counseyll
Ground of great hindringe a dredefull disseiuour
Fair of face with a perlous tail
Gladly concludynge with full great disauaile
Neyt neighbor unto repentance
To all that trust and have in her plesaunce
Lenuoye
Princis princessis concidre how in every age
Folks been deuers of their condition
To plye and turn and change in their courage
Yet is there none to mine opinion
So dreadful change ne transmutacion
As change of princis to give Judgment
Or hasty credence without auysement
It is well found a passing great damage
Known and expert in every region
Though a tale have a fair visage
It may include full great decepcion
Hid under sugar galle and fell poison
With a fressh face of double entendment
Yet give no credence without auysement
Let folks beware of their langage
Keep their tunges form oblocucion
To hindre or hurt by no manner outrage
Preserve their lips from all detraccion
From chau^pertie and contradiction
For lest that fraud were found in their intent
Ne give no credence without auysement
Princis princessis of noble and high parage
Which have lordship and dominacion
Void them aside that can flater and fage
Fro tunges that have a terrage of treason
Stop your erys from their bitter soun
Be circumspecte not hasty but prudent
And give no credence without auisement
Of queen Althea / and how Hercules by wyme^ was brought to confusion
When bochas had showed his sentence
And declared his opinion
Against them that were hasty of credence
He began anon to make a digression
Fro that matter and of entencion
To search out mo / his purpos to contune
That were down cast and hintryd by fortune
And as him thought he saw a company
Of many worthy which did apere
And among all first he did aspye
Queen althea as she began nigh him nere
All bywepte her face and also her chere
With salt teerys that pity was to seen
Which su^tyme was of calsidonye the queen
She was the daughter of king testius
Weddyd to Oene of calcidonye king
Of chere and face apperynge full pitous
Her here to torn and frowardly lyenge
And in token also of compleynynge
As writith bochas whereof he took good head
Black was her habyte and torn was her wede
A son she had melliager he hight
In earth was there none feirer to se
Right well fauouryd in every men's sight
And as I find at his natiuite
Present were the fatal sustres three
With their rocks and bigan forto spynne fast
And took a bronde and in to fire it cast
And in that hour this was their langage
Touching this child we full accordyd be
And have disposyd also the term of his age
The space concludyd of his destyne
As long time who so lift to se
Till this bronde among the coals read
Be full consumyd in to ashes deed
But when althea aspyed their entente
And conceyuyd the fine of their sentence
She roos up and the bronde she hente
Out of the fire with full great deligence
Quenchyd anon the firys violence
The dome of parchas she began thus disobeye
The bronde reserving under lock and keye
Touching the fader of this meliager
Orneus of him thus I read
How that he sought nygh and far
Gods and goddesses who so list take heed
In hope only for to have great mede
For to them all poets thus divise
Save to diane he did sacrifise
Whereof she caught an indignacion
Cast she would on him auengyd be
Sent a bore into his region
Full savage and full of cruelle
Which deuouryd the fruit of many tree
And destroyed his cornys and his vynes
That such scarsnesse of vitailes and of wynes
Was in his land upon every side
That the people of necessite
Compellyd were among to provide
So^me mean weye / to save their cuntre
And at the last they condescendyd be
That melliager lusty of his courage
Should chief with him folks fressh and young of age
This dreadful boor mightily to enchace
And forth they went echon deuoide of dread
With round speres they began him to manace
But meliager made first his sides read
And with a sword than smote of his head
Whereof the cuntrye was both glad and feign
And in this wise the tusky bore was slain
Su^me books tell of this hunting
That a lady which was borne in arge
Called atthalonta daughter to the king
To sle this bore took on her the charge
And with an arowe made his wounds large
Also in Ouide like as it is found
Because that she yaue the first wound
Melliager anon for a memory
As he that was her own chosyn knight
Yaue her the head in tokene of this victory
But his tw^^ne uncles against all skyll and right
Raft her the head of very force land might
Having despite that she in her auyce
Of this victory should bear away the price
With which Injury melliager was wroth
Against them proudly began disdeyne
Pullyd out a sword and upon them goth
And through his manhood slough his uncles tweyne
And after that did his besy pain
To take the head and with humble intent
To athalente again to be present
One of his uncles was called Flexippus
A manly knight / but young of age
That other brother named theseus
But when there suster herd of that outrage
How they were slain / she began in her visage
Wexe deed and pale alas for her blood
When she aspyed the cause how it stood
She had no matter god wot to be sayn
Queen althea to stand and behold
Her brethern tweyne of her son slain
At the hunting of which tofore I told
First things twayn she began peise and unfold
Of her brethern the love / and nigh kynrede
And of her son the hasty cruel deed
And remembrynge she castyth in balaunce
Of hertly woo that she did endure
Thought if she did upon their death vengeance
To sle her son it were against nature
Thus in a werre long time she did endure
Her dedely sorrow peisynge every dell
Whedre she shall be tender or cruel
Thus tender I mean her son for to spare
Or punissh the death of her brethern tweyne
Thus confortles all distitute and bare
In languisshinge she enduryd forth her pain
And remedy can she non ordeyne
Save feign she would euenge her if she may
But than forth came nature and said nay
It was her son against all kyndly right
Of whom she cast auengyd for to be
To wymen all / an ougly strange sight
That a mother deuoide of all pity
Should sle her child so mercyles parde
Nay not so nature woll not assente
For if she did full sore she should repent
But o alas all fatal purueaunce
Kepyth his course as sum clerkys said
But the writing of doctoures in substance
And these deuines reply there again
And afferme the opinion is in vain
Of them that trust in fate or destyne
For god above has the soueraynte
And of fortune the power may restrain
To save and spyll like as folk deserve
Against his will they may no thing ordeyne
Of necessite what course that they conserve
But this matter all holy I reserve
Unto diuynes to determyne and conclude
Which not perteynyth unto folks rude
But althea of calcidonye queen
Began sore muse and henge in balaunce
Her brethern deed when she did them seen
Than was she meuyd anon to do vengeance
Upon her son by full great displesaunce
But as poets list for to compyle
Nature made her withdraw her hand a while
Thus bitwene ire and affection
She held her long of every pertye stable
Till that she caught in her opinion
A sodeyn rancoure which made her be vengeable
And hasty wrath which is not commendable
Against her sone made her with her hand
Out of her chyst to take the fatell bronde
And suddenly she cast it in the fire
And wexyd cruel against all womanhede
To execute her venymous desire
The fatal bronde among the coals read
Consumyd was in to asshis deed
And furiously in her malencoly
The vengeance done she thus began to cry
O ye parcas froward susters three
Which of jove keep the lybrarye
And of children at their natiuite
Awayte the sentence which may not varye
Wherso it be wilful or contrary
Upon his domes taking always head
How that ye shall dispose the fatal threde
Thou cloto takyst thy rock on hand
And lathesys after does bygynne
By great auise who so can understand
The threde of length to draw and to spyrine
But when the spirit shall from the body twynne
Thou antropos do thy cruel pain
Full frowardly to part the threde in tweyne
I may well plain in such deperticion
Not for a day but woo alas for ever
Ye have vntwynyd and made division
Of my two brethern and caused them disseuer
That here on live I shall se them never
And I of have alas why did I so
To avenge their death have slain my son also
O ye daughters of arberus the fell
Whoos ougly modre was the black night
And all your kynred and lynage live in hell
And for to avenge the wrong and great unright
Which I have accomplisshid in your sight
I woll with you perpetually complain
Like my desert endure sorrow and pain
And while began with her self thus strive
Upon her sorrows that were endless
She made a sword through her heart to ryue
Of her self here she was recheles
And bochas after among all the prees
Saw as him thought with a full hidious chere
Deed of visage hercules appear
Whoos fadre was Jupiter the greet
His mother daughter of amphitrion
Called Alcumena sumtyme borne in crete
And as poetis reherce one by oon
So excellent was there never none
To speak of conquest of victory and of fame
Here in this world that had so great a name
Dreadful of look he was and right terrible
His beerd also black which henge full low down
And all his here as brestles were horrible
His robe also full merueylous of facion
Was of the skin of a feers lion
Which from his back of verrey force he rent
Within a forest alone when he went
In his hand he bare a maas of steell
Which to behold was wonder long and huge
By appearance as bochas felt well
Demyd of reason a rightful Judge
That hercules had to his refuge
Wisdom with force for to encrece his fame
As beestys wild for to make them tame
And unto bochas he began loud cry
Take right good head for it is no fable
I for my merits to speak of cheualrye
And noble triumphs am most commendable
To be preferryd most worthy and most able
Which have aco^plisshed all that may excelle
Through high prowess that any tongue can tell
Also of my birth in heaven full thore ago
Fully conceived my constellacion
Mighty Juno said unto Inno
On such a da^ in such a regeon
One shall be ^^^ne most mighty of renoun
Noblest of nobl^s both in werre and pees
Of whom the name shall be Hercules
The which dome when Inno understood
Of Jupiter conceyuinge the entente
And knew my fate should be so good
To lucynya her messaunger she sent
But sum seith how down her self she went
To this goddess / goddess of chyldynge
And her bisought to grant her / her asking
That she would from hercules translate
The influence of his natiuite
Help to reserve his name and his fate
And grant it holy to young Euristee
And that lucynya present would be
The same hour by jupiter provided
It to possede all hool and vndyuidyd
Thus to the mother of this euristee
Juno the goddess grauntyd her favor
Thereby disposynge that he should be
Mighty of puyssaunce like an emperor
But of his noblesse the conquest and labor
And of his manhood the prowess and pursuit
By hercules was fully execute
This hercules had the traueyle
And ^uristeus bare away the name
Also hercules faught in plate and maile
And high emprises proudely did attame
But the report of his noble fame
To curistius fully was ascriued
Thus of his thank was hercules deprived
Full often in armies s^^n man does full well
And often causith that the field is won
And of a another that did never adele
The price out spredith like as shines the son
And often it happens that he that has best run
Does not the spear like his desert possede
Where falls favor yeueth every man his mede
Fame in her palice has trumpes mo than oon
Sum of gold that yeuith a full fressh soun
Sum man has land and deseruith noon
And sum heue be full worthy of renoun
No thing preferryd by commendacion
As by report of statys high and low
So frowardly fame his trumpe has blow
Touching armies the pour ne the rich
Ben not of hertes echon coragious
Neither all men may not be eliche
Neither of their name egal ne gracious
And though the pour have been victorious
Of a venture to do full well sum day
Other have pynchyd to take his thank away
One sleeth the dear with an hokyd arawe
Whoos part is none yet of the venyson
One betith the busshe another has the sparowe
And all the bryddes in his possession
One draws his nets in ryuers up and down
With sundry baitys cast out line and hoke
And has no part of all that ever he took
An euydence hereof ye may se
Full notale to be put in memory
Of Hercules and of Euristye
For hercules gate ay the victory
And euristeus recyued has the glory
Thus their palm departed was in tweyne
That one reioysed that other bare the pain
Euristeus was prince of Athene
Son and heir by descent of line
Unto the king that called was scellene
Under whoos might as bochas does determyne
Hercules through knightly disciplyne
Provided so most manly and most wise
That from all other he bare away the prise
^ut woe alas that ever it should fall
So manly a knight so noble and notable
That any spot should his price appalle
Or cause his courage for to be unstable
Which is a thing doleful and lamentable
From his knyghthode which a thing to strange
That ever a woman should his heart change
I woll excuse them by cause their nature
Is to change hertys and coragys
Against their nature no force may endure
For their ^laterie and sugryd fair langage
Like Serenes fresshe of their visagis
For to enchaunge of princis the noblesse
More than hercules can bear hereof witness
Thus hercules astonyed and asshamyd
Unto bochas showed his presence
Said alas my knyghthode is diffamyd
By a full falls amerous pestilence
So sore constreyned by mortal violence
Whereby alas my manhood was applied
To sleyth of wymen oppressyd and maistryed
To took their habyte and cloth me in their wede
To shere my berde and force me visage
With oyntementis against all manhede
To make it souple and change my langage
And to complain more of mine outrage
Upon my fyngers vtwies told
I had rings richely wrought of gold
Thus was my courage chaungyd feminine
For love of one called yolee
Of conditions though she were serpentyne
Me thought she was fairest upon to se
That all my joy was with her to be
And that none should aperceyue my trespass
I chaungyd both habyte look and face
And was a woman outward in appearance
Of intent to have more liberty
To use my lustys and have experience
Of appetitis which that unlawful be
Whereof the sclaundre reboundyth upon me
That I dare say my outrageous trespace
Does all my knyghthode and prowes difface
Whereof o bochas I pray the take good head
For to discryue in terms plain and clear
Mine infortune like as it was in deed
That when other conceive the manner
Of mine vnhappis contagious for to here
They may by example / of me do their pain
From vicious life their hertys to restreyne
For these folys that all wisdom despise
And been contrary to vortuouse disciplyne
May give example to folkys that been wise
And been to them a lantern of doctrine
Vicis to eschew and prudently declyne
Fro flesshly lustys for it is taught in scolys
That wise men all day been taught by foolys
When bochas had conceyuyd the pleynt
Of hercules in his apperynge
And how his nobles by wymen was atteynt
Through his disordynate living
He thought anon him remembrynge
It had be ruth for to put in mind
His vicis all / and virtues left behind
Considre also it was inpertynent
Outher by langage to write against all right
Any thing that should in sentinent
The fame amenuse of so noble a knight
Or to discrees in any ma^^ys sight
His glorious prowess / ^^th poetis for his werri^
Reise his renoun so high above the sterrys
For he was both knight and philosophere
And for his strength called a geaunt
For common profit he began all pro^^ly profre
Of manly courage ^eue thereto full grant
To enter into Egypt to sle the geaunt
Called Busiris of full falls intent
Slough all strangers ye through his kingdom went
For under a color of lyberalite
Unto his palys gladly he would call
Strangers echon that came through his cuntre
And solemply receue them one and all
And like a king both in chamber and hall
Make them such chere in all manner thing
As aperteynyd to a worthy king
But while his gestys lay a night and sleep
This false tyrant in full cru^l wise
Murdryd them echon or they took keep
And after that / this was also his gyse
With their blood to make a sacrifise
To Jupiter god of that cuntre
Of hole intent to plese his deite
That in his kingdom of fruits and greyn
The land encreasyd by great habundau^^^
Down from heuyn he would send they^^ reyne
This mean he made and this cheuyss^^^ce
To murdre and sle he had so great pl^sau^ce
For all thing him thought it did him good
To murdre his gestys and shede their blood
But when this murdre of Busiris was couth
That no stranger might pass his land in pees
This manly knight yet flowynge in youth
This noble famous this worthy hercules
Amongys other he put him self in ^^^es
And like a gest outward in shewy^ge
Came to the palys of Eusiris the king
Rebukid him of his great outrage
Done to his gestys by cruel violence
And for to make pesible that passage
And for to avenge that his importable offense
And of his murdre to make a recompense
This hercules slough busiris in deed
And took the blood which he did blede
Offryd it up Jupiter to plese
For this vectorye him to magnifye
And all egypt thus was set in ese
Their lands their fruits began also multiplye
Their greyn encresyd about on each ^tye
And to habounde by influence of ^ey^
Which before time of vitaile was bareyn
Another geaunt called antheus
King of Libie and governed all that land
Whom hercules most strong and most coragious
Sumtyme out^aide and sloughe him with his hand
For as they wras^lyd by experience he fond
Touching the earth this Geaunt it is true
His force his might did alw^y renew
But when hercules the manner did aspye
How his strength renewed again so often
Therayenst he shope a remedy
Hye in the air he percyd him up a loft
And withis hard and no thing soft
Back and bone so sore he did enbrace
That he fill deed to fore him in that place
But su^me bokys of this Geaunt tell
Within his kingdom who did him assail
He would of new his chivalry compelle
Eft again to mete him in bataile
And in this wise full feelde he did fail
To aforce of new as folk shall understand
His strength his might all ennemy^s to withstonde
But hercules of high discrecion
The feelde on him manly to recure
Had him by sleight out of his region
And as they met there of adventure
The said Antheus might not endure
But was discomfited by hercules anon
Maugre his might and his men echone
After this conquest hercules is goon
For exercise his prowes for to use
Against the mighty strong Gercon
King of spain / of melleager / and Ebuse
The which tyrant might him not excuse
That all his labor as poetis ly^t compile
Was from these realms his people to exile
His tyranny might not long endure
For hercules that noble worthy knight
Made upon him a great discounfiture
And slough the tyrant as they met in fight
And after that through his great might
Of high prowes and magnanymyte
Slough Cerberus with his hedys three
The famous bole of the land of crete
Which that distroied all that region
He slough also when that they did mete
And in Nemea he slough a feers lion
And for a record of his high renoun
Of manly force his skyn away he took
And to his body a coot thereof he shope
To all his enemies to show him more dreadful
Therefore he ware that hidious garnement
And for he was in armies never found dull
But ^lyke f^essh ever in his intent
Into a mouteyne anon he made his went
Called ^^^nantus and there in his passage
He slough Ab^or most wild and most savage
Beside a river called stiphalus
Of furious briddes he slough a great noumbre
Within the kyngedome of king pheneus
All the ^untre they did encumbre
For which their shadow and contagious vmbre
On sede on fruits where ever they alyght
All was deuou^yd in every mannys sight
Upon the mounteyne called auentyne
Which is not f^r fro rome the cite
There is a wode as chronicles determyne
Right fresshe of sight and goodly on to se
And hercules passing by that cuntre
Fro Spaynewarde passing by ytaile
Ca^hus the geaunt did him there assail
While Ercules among the leuys grene
Laid him to sleep by sodeyne adventure
And his beestes against the son shene
While that he slept went in their pasture
Came Cachus forth full hidious of stature
Thought he would these beestys with him have
Stall them echon and hide them in a cave
And like a thief he made them go bacwarde
That no man should the tracis of them know
Neither of their passage have no reward
For by their tails he led them on a row
Into his cave which that stood full low
And for they were of excellent fairness
To keep them cloos he did his business
Out of his sleep when hercules awoke
And perceived his oxen were away
He roos up and ^est about his look
Began to asspye in all the have he may
To what pertye the tracis of them lay
And while he stood thus musing in the shade
He herd lowynge that his oxen made
And by their lowynge he began anon aproch
Toward the pertye where they were kept full cloos
Fond the cave under a mighty roche
And proud Cachus which had them in depoos
Against Hercules he s^^rdely aroos
But for all that he might him self not save
For he him slough at the entering of the cave
And thus his beestys he has again recuryd
That sempt before inrecuperable
After the mounteyn by force he has assuryd
Which for brigantys before was full doutable
But by his knighthode it was made habytable
That men might for dread of any foo
When ever they would freely come and goo
Tou^hinge his conquest upon femyne
Against amazones with theseus he went
The queen ypolita through his chiualrye
For his pray anon to him he hent
And ypolita of full true intent
Yaue unto him in tokene of victory
Of gold a gyrdell to have him in memory
After to affryk he went a full great paas
Only of purpos the gardeyn for to se
Which aparteyned to king Athlas
That brother was to the king Promothe
In astrology full well expert was he
And of this gardeyn of which I have you told
The rich branches and apples were of gold
Through magik made by great auysement
Full streite kept and closyd enuyron
And I watchyd with a fell serpent
That no man entryd that rich mancion
But Hercules most mighty of renoun
The serpent slought through his manly pursuit
And fro the gardeyne he bare away the f^^te
This said Athlas as books specify
And poetys also of him endyte
He was cu^nynge in astronomye
And therein did full greatly him delight
And many a book he made and did wry^e
With great labor and great diligence
In his time upon that science
The which were more precious than gold
And more rich in his opinion
But hercules in soth as it is told
Gate all the books through his high renoun
Bare them by force out of that region
And to Greece like a conqueror
With him he brought for a great tresoure
Of trace he slough the gea^nt outrageous
That sumtyme was called Diomede
Which that murdryd all that came to his house
And with their flesh his horse he did feed
And through his wit / labor / and manhede
Of Achelaus which was a great wonder
He made the stremes for to deperte asundre
And by his wisdom did them so divide
In two perties disseueringe his passage
For before no man might abide
Of his course the furious fell outrage
For in cuntrees it did so great damage
Turnynge upward there was none other bote
Where ever it flowed / of trees crop and rote
A great emprise he did also undertake
When that the mes hidious and horreble
Arriuyd up of Archadies the lake
Which with their teeth and mowthes terrible
Called learn the bestes full odible
Fruit / greyn / and corn did mortaly devour
But Hercules the cuntre to socoure
Came like a knight their malice for to let
And by his prudence destroyed them euerychon
With in the lake the wormys up he shet
Save among all behind was left one
And against him / this hercules anon
Of knyghthode caught so great auantage
That to the cuntre he did no more damage
Thus all that ever may rehercyd be
Touching knyghthode / prowess / or prudence
Or glorious fame / or long felicite
This knightly man had most excellence
And in armies longest experience
And for his triumphs and actis marciall
He set up pilers for a memorial
Which remembryd his conquestys most notable
And his dedys by grauynge did express
Beyond which no land is habitable
So far a broad sprad his noblesse
But as the son leueth his brightness
Sumtyme when he is fresshe^t in his spear
With unware clouds that suddenly appear
Semblably the noblesse and the glory
Of hercules in this unstable life
Eclipsyd was / and shadowyd his memory
By Deianira that sumtyme was his wife
For by her fraud came in the mortal strife
As ye shall here the manner and the caas
Whereby that he lost his life alas
Yet for her sake this most manly man
Faught as I find in singular bataile
With Achelous son of the Occian
Like as poetis make rehersaile
And as each proudly did assail
This hercules of knighthode souereyne
Sent from his head one of his armies tweyne
Of king Deem she was the daughter dear
To hercules joined by marriage
And as they came to great a ryuere
With sturdy wawes where was no passage
Nessus the geaunt ougly of visage
To hercules profryd his seruyse
And full falsely against him bygan deuyse
Made his promys to hercules in deed
To put his life in great adventure
Over the streme deianire to lead
By cause he was large of his stature
And for she was a right fair creature
When they passyd and I come to land
Nessus falsy would upon the stronde
Have know her flesshly / like as write ouyde
Hercules having thereof a sight
As he abode upon that other side
And for to avenge him of his great unright
Took his bow and bent it anon right
And with an arowe filyd sharp and ground
Yaue to Nessus his dedly fatell wound
Like a conduyt gusshyd out the blood
And when he saw that he must dye
To Deianire tofore him there she stood
With all his heart her he bigan pray
That in one thing his lust she would obey
To take his shert and be not recheles
With blood desteyned and send it hercules
Therewith him to be reconciled
And she to him anon the sherte has sent
Through whoos venym alas he was begilyd
For what by touching and what by enchauntment
His flesh his bonys were all brent
And among his dedely peynes all
In to a rage he suddenly is fall
And as a be furiously he ran
On v^l^es hills among the craggy stones
Semblably as does a wood man
Pullyd up trees and rotes all at ones
Brake beestys horns and all to knew her bonys
Was it ^at pity that a knight so good
Should among beestis re^ne savage and wood
Thus ouerwhelmyd was all his worthynesse
And to declyne went his prosperitye
And cause and root of his wretchydnesse
Was for that he set all his felicite
To trust so much the mutabilite
Of these wymen which erly and soon
Of their nature braide upon the moon
Alas alas all noblesse and prudence
Prowess of nature force and chyualrye
For sight of wisdom discrecion and science
Virtuous study profitynge in clergy
And the clear shynynge of philosophy
Has through falls lustys here be manacyd
By sleight of wymen derkyd and diffacyd
O hercules I feel my pen quake
Mine ynke fulfullyd with bitter teerys salt
This pitous tragedye to write for thy sake
Whom all poetys glorify and exalte
But fraud of wymen made thy renoun halt
And froward muses thy triumphs all to rende
For to descryue alas thy fatal end
Lenuoye
THe soot venym the sauery poison
The dreadful joy the dolerous plesaunce
The woeful gladness the furious treason
Feith despiryd ay stable in variaunce
Virtue exilynge where lust has governance
Through falls luxury diffacen all noblesse
As this tragedy can bear full well witness
Where froward venus has dominacion
And blind Cupide his subgettis does auaunce
And wylfull lust through indiscrecion
Is chosyn judge to hold the balaunce
Their choice unlawful has through unhappy chance
Derkyd of princes the famous high noblesse
As this tragedye bears full well witness
O thou hercules for all thy high renoun
For all thy conquest and knyghtly suffisaunce
Thou were through wymen brought to confusion
And through their fraud and thy renomyd puissaunce
Disclaundryd was and brought unto myschaunce
I were ashamyd to write it or express
Except this tragedy can bear me well witness
Princis pricessis of high discrecion
This thing emprentid in your remembrance
Of others falling make your protection
You to preserve through prudent purueaunce
Before provided that your perseueraunce
Be not perturbyd by no falls sorceresse
As this tragedy of other berith witness
A process of Narcisus. Bible. Mirra. and of other their infortunes to bochas
compleynynge
nArcisus / biblis / and mirra all th^^
Tofore bochas pitously did appear
Their infortunes their infelicite
To him compleynynge with a dedly chere
And of their coming to tell the manner
Narasus first with sorrow and dooll atteynt
Bygan first all declare his compleynt
He was the sone of Cephisus the flode
And his mother called ^rope
And by distent borne of gentle blood
Of creatures fairest on to se
And as I find at his natiuite
Tiresias by sprit of prophecy
Touching his fate thus began specify
Ouidius xo. et xio. de transformatis
And of his harp if ye lift to here
The god of appollo made a translacion
Among the ymagis of the sterris clear
Whereof men may have clear inspection
But fortune to his confusion
Denied him froward of her nature
When he was slay^^ fredom of sepulture
Next Orpheus there did appear also
Of amazones worthy queens tweyne
Merpesia and her suster Lampedo
Which in conquest did their besy pain
And great worship in armies did atteyne
Namynge him self by writynge nere and far
Daughters to mars which is god of werre
Merpesia rood out in regions
And conqueryd full many a great Cite
For couetise of great possessions
To encreace her lordship if it would be
And her suster kept suerly their cuntre
Of all enemies so there was no doubt
While merpesia roode with her oost about
But while she was in conquest most famous
And her enemies proudly did assail
Fortune anon wex contrarious
And caused she was slain in battle
Lo what conquest or victory may avail
When that fortune do at them disdeyne
See here example by these queen's tweyne
Lenuoy
tHi^ tragedy remembers things five
Of Narcisus the excellent bewtye
And of biblis death also descryue
The great luxury and dishonest^
Mirra diffamyd tournyd to a tree
To exemplify that lechery and pride
Been from all virtue set full far aside
How orpheus enduryd in his live
Joy entermedlyd with aduersite
In his youth when he did wine
He felt in wedlo^ full great felicite
His worldly bliss meynt with duplicite
As fortune her chaungis can diuyde
Which from all virtue be set full far aside
Merpesia for her lift to strive
With wilful wer^^s to encreace her cu^tre
But her pomp was ouerturned blyue
When in battle unwarily slain was she
For of all werre death is the fine parde
So furious mars can for her folk provide
Which from all virtues been set full far aside
Ye mighty princes ^^e wit and reason drive
Your high noblesse to considere and se
How fortune estatys can depryue
And plonge them down from their prosperity
Pride and luxury I counseile that ye flee
Falls avarice ne late not be your gyd^
Which from all virtue is set full far aside
^owe Narcisus / Biblis / and mirra dyed at the ^yscheef
ANd thus Narcisus through dau^gere and disdeyn
Upon the lady did crull vengeau^^
But when the goddis his cruelte ha^ ^^yn
Towardys him they fill a great greuaunce
Of his vnmercy they had displesaunce
And right as he merciles was found
So with vnmercy he caught his dedely wound
For all danger displesith to venus
And all disdeyne is lothsum to cupide
For who to love is contracious
The god of love will quite him on su^me side
His dreadful arowes so mortaly divide
To hurt and mayme all that been recheles
And in his seruise found merciles
And for Narcisus was not merciable
Toward Echo for his great bewtye
But in his port was found vntretable
Cupide thought he would auengyd be
As he that her prayer herd of pite
Causynge narcisus to feel and to have his pert
Of venus bronde and of her fiery darte
And on a day when he in wilderness
Had after bestes ru^ne in hunting
And for long labor began fall in werinesse
He was desirous to have so^me refresshinge
And wonder thurstlewe after trauaylynge
Might not endure lengre there to dwell
And at the last he fond a c^^stall well
Right fressh spryngynge and wondre agreeable
The water lusty and delitable of sight
And for his thurst was unto him importable
Upon the brinkes ^e fill down right
And by reflection in mids of the water bright
Him thought he saw a passing fair image
To him appear most angelyk of visage
He was anameryd with the semelynesse
And desirous thereof to stand in grace
And yet it was not but a likeness
And but a shadow reflectynge of his face
The which of fruence amerously to enbrace
This Narcisu^ with a pitous compleynt
Ste^^e into the well and so him self dreynt
And thus his bewte alas was laid full low^
His semelynesse put full far abak
Thus when that he began first him silf to know
And seen his visage in which there was no la^
Presumptuous pride caused all to wrak
For who to much does of him self presume
His own usurping woll sonest him consu^^
And finally as these old poets tell
This Narcisus without more secou^r
After that he was drownyd at the well
The heavenly goddys did him this favor
They tournyd him into a full fressh flower
A water lilly which does remedy
In hot accessys as bokys specify
After that Narcisus was at the well dreyn^
And to John bochas de^larid had his woo
^iblis apperyd with teeris all be spreynt
And toward him a great paas began she go^
And her brother Ca^nus came also
And of one womb as gemelles tweyne
But she tofore her fate began complain
She in her love was not virtuous
For against god and kinds ordinance
She louyd her brother that ca^nus
And when she saw her froward governance
He unto her yaue none attendaunce
Though she of slight to complissh her intent
In secret wise a pis^le to him sent
She said it was an impossible thing
Without her grace her self to save
And but he were to her assenting
She else plainly may not health have
But only death and afterward her grave
Thus in her writynge to him she did attain
And to be covert she ^e wrote no name
But when this pistle came to his presence
Virtuously thereat he began disdeyne
And yaue thereto no manner aduertence
Neither took none head of her furious pain
But suffryd her eternally to pleyne
Till that she was as Ouide can well tell
With often weeping transfourmyd to a well
Next came mirra with face full pitous
Which that sumtyme louyd against nature
Her own fadre called Cinarus
For whoos sake great pain she did endure
For she ne durst her sorrow not discure
Till her norice by signs did aspie
The hertly constreynt of her maladye
For her norice of which that I have told
Conceived has by open evidence
As she knows both of new and old
In such matters all hole the experience
That through long labor and sleyghty diligence
Diverse weies and means out she sought
To her faders bed that she mirra brought
With whom she had her lust and her plesaunce
For she unknow lay with him all night
He was disceyuyd by dronklewe ignorance
And on the morrow long or any light
She stale away and went out of his sight
With her uorice kept her long cloos
Till unto the time her womb rose
But her fader that was of Cipre king
Which as I told was called Cinarus
When he the truth aspied of this thing
That by his daughter he was disceyued thus
She wexe to him loath sum and odious
Fled from his face so sore she was aferde
And he pursued after with his sword
In arabye the hot mighty land
King Cinarus has his daughter found
And cruelly began enhaunce his hand
With his sword to give her a wound
But the goddys of mercy most habounde
Have fro the death made her goo fre
And through their power transfourmyd to a tree
Which after her berith yet the name
Called Mirra as she was in her life
Out of which auctours say the same
Distillith a gu^me a great preseruatif
And of nature a full good defensife
To keep bodies from putrifaccion
And them fraunchise from all corrupcion
By influence of the son bemys
Mirre is engendryd by distillinge of his kind
With round droppis against phoebus stremys
And down descendith through the hard rind
And through the ^^ftys also I find
The seyde Mirra has a child forth brought
In all this world that it be well sought
Was none so fair fourmyd by nature
For of his beauty he was peerles
And as poetis record by scripture
He called was the fair adonydes
And to his worship and his great encrees
For he of fairness bare away the flower
Venus him chase to be her peramoure
The which gods yaue to him in charge
That he should in his tender age
In forestys while he went at large
Hunte at no beestys which that were savage
But he contrary to his disauantage
Through wilfulness I can say you no more
Was slain unwarily of a tusky boore
At the which he felly did enchace
But of folly in veyn was his labor
For he lay slain full pale of chere and face
Whom venus tournyd to a full fressh flower
Which was as blood of purple the color
Abud of goolde with goodly leuys glade
Set in the mids whose bewtye may not fade
And when that Mirra fro bochas was withdraw
And declared her great aduersite
And of his fate told the motall law
Came Orpheus full ougly unto se
Son of appollo and of caliope
And apperyd with a full doolfull face
Sumtyme brought forth and yborne in trace
Full renomed in arms and in science
Famous in musyk and melodye
And full notable also in eloquence
And for his sote sugared armonye
Beestys fowls poetys specify
Wodys flodys of their course most strong
Stynt of course to harken his sote song
An harp he had of Mercurious
With the which Erudice he wan
And to bachus as writ ouidius
Sacrifisis solemn he began
And unto hell for his wife he ran
Her to recure with ^oot touchis sharp
Which that he made upon his heavenly harp
But when that he this labor on him took
A law was made which that bond him sore
That if that he bakwarde cast his look
He should her lose and se his wife no more
But it is said sithen goon full yore
There may no law lovers well constreyne
So importable is their dedly pain
If su^me husbondes had stand in the caas
To have lost their wives for a look soden
They would have suffryd and not said alas
But patiently enduryd all their pain
And thankyd god that broken was the cheyne
Which has so long them in prisonbounde
That they by grace has such a fredom found
To lie in prison it is a full great charge
And to be stokked under key and lok
It well merry a man to goo at large
Than with yrons to be nailed to a blok
But there is a bond which called is wedlok
Fetterynge husbondes so sore that is wondre
Which with a file may not be broke asundre
But Orpheus fader of armonye
Thought Erudice which was his wife so fair
For her sake he felt that he must dye
Because that he when he made his repair
Of her in troth no thing enbracyd but air
Thus he lost her there is no more to seyne
And for the constreynt of his grievous pain
Al his heart her partynge sat so sore
The grene memory the tender remembrance
That he would never wyue more
So fair he was escapyd his penance
For wedlok is a life of much plesaunce
But who has ones infernal pain seyn
Woll never his thanks come in the snare ageyn
Ob quam ca^m secundas spreuit nupcias
This Orpheus yaue counseyll full notable
To husbondys that have enduryd pain
To such as been prudent and tretable
One hell is dreadful / and more perilous been tweyne.
And who is ones bound in a cheyne
And may escape out of daungere blyue
If he resort god let him never thryue
Upon this sentence wymen were vengeable
And to his writynge full contrarious
Said his counseyll was not comendable
At the feast they halued to bachus
They fill echon upon this orpheus
And for all his rethorik sweet
They slough alas this laureat poet
The goddis have provided for him a space
To live in earth and so long endure
Till (...) at he know and se his own face
And for his sake full many a ceruature
By ordinance of god and of nature
When they him see shall feel full great pain
If they in love his grace may not atteyne
^ut he shall be contrary and dangerous
And of his port sul^ of strangeness
And his heart right ^^ly surquydous
By the occasion of his natif fairness
And presumynge of his semelynesse
No woman so fressh ne fair of face
That able were to stand in his grace
And for the excellence of his great bewte
He purposyd him in his tender age
Neuir in his life weddyd for to be
He thought him so fair of visage
For which he cast him through his great outrage
Against all lusts of love to disdeyne
To hunte at bestes alone and be slain
And in this while that he kept him so
In forest and in wilderness
A water gods that called was Echo
Louyd him full hot for his great fairness
And sekirly did her besinesse
To follow his steps right as any line
To her desires to make him to inclyne
He herd her well but he saw her not
Whereof astonyed anon he began to enquere
As he that was amerueylyd in his thought
Seyde euene thus / Is any wight now here
And she answered the same in her manner
What ever he said as longith to Echo
Without a bode she said the same him to
Come nere quod she and began to call
Come nere quod she my joy and my plesaunce
He lokyd about among the rokkes all
And saw no thing beside ne in distaunce
But she abraide and declarynge her greuaunce
And to him said mine own heart dear
Ne be not strange but let us dwell in fere
Nay nay quod he I woll no thing obey
To your desires for short conclusion
Well lever I had pleynly for to dye
Than ye should have of me possession
We be no thing of one opinion
I here you well though I no figure se
Go forth your wey ye speak no more with me
And she ashamyd fled her weye anon
As she that might of him no socoure have
But dispeyred this echo is forth gone
And hyd her sefl in an ougly cave
Among the rokkes is buried in her grave
And though so be that men her voice may here
After that time she never durst apere
Of Priamus king of Troy / And how the Monk of Bury translatoure of this
book wrote a book of the siege of troy called troy book
AFter these compleyntes and lamentacions
Which that bochas did in his book compile
Medlyd among with transmutacions
Set in ouide by full souereyne style
When he on them had inusyd a long while
Se the manner both of sorrow and joy
He began to remember of Priamus of Troy
First of his birth and of his kynrede
How among kings he was most famous
And as poetys record of him in deed
He descended of worthy darnamus
Which as his line declares unto us
From Jupiter was finally come down
Unto his fader called king Lamedoun
Of old troy this Lamedoun was king
Destroyed by Grekys he and his cuntre
After whom this Priamus reignynge
Made therayen a mighty strong cite
Where he full long in full great rialtie
With wife and children most worthy of renoun
With ceptre and crown held the possession
Gouernyd his cite in pees and rightwisnesse
And fortune was to him favorable
For of all asie the tresoure and richesse
He did assemble this king most honorable
And in armies he was so commendable
That through the world as far as men may goon
Of high noblesse the renoun of him shone
This priamus had children many one
Worthy princes and of full great might
But Ector was among them euerichon
Called of prowess the lantern and the light
For there was never borne a better knight
Troylus in knighthode so manly was found
That he was named Ector the secounde
But if I should reherce the manhede
Of king priam and of his sons all
And how his cite besiegyd was in deed
And all the story to remembrance call
Between him and grekys how it is befall
The circumstauncis rehersynge up and down
To set in order the first occasion
Of the siege why it was first leyde
By hercules and also by Jason
The manner hole in troy book is said
Rudly endited of my translacion
Following upon the destruction
Called the secounde which by a cou^tis clear
Fully enduryd the space of ten year
For as me seems the labor were in vein
Truly also I not to what intent
That I should write it new ageyn
For I had onys in commandment
By him that was most noble and excellent
Of kings all for to undertake
It to translate and write it for his sake
And if ye list to wete whom I mean
Henry the fifth most mighty of puissaunce
Yaue me the charge of intent full clean
Thing of old time to put in remembrance
The same henry for knightly suffisaunce
Worthy for manhood rekene kings all
With nine worthy for to have a stall
To holy church he was cheef diffensoure
In all such causis cristys chosen knight
To destroy heretics he set all his labor
Louyd all virtues and to sustain right
Through his noblesse his manhood and his myht
Was diligent and did his besy pain
To have set pees betwyxe realms tweyne
I mean in soth between Inglonde and france
His purpose was to have had a pees fynall
Sought out meanys with many circumstaunce
As well by trete as actis marciall
Thereon Iupertied life gods and all
But woe alas against death is no bone
This land may say he dyed all to sone
For among kings he was one of the best
So all his dedys conveyed were by grace
I pray to god so give his soul good rest
With holy seyntis in heuyn a dwelling place
For here with us to little was the space
That he abode of whom the remembrance
Shall never dye in ynglande ne in France
This worthy king yaue to me in charge
In ynglisshe tunge to make a translacion
Out of latin within a volym large
How long the gregys lay to fore the town
And how that Paris first at Citheroun
In venus temple slighly did his pain
There to rejoice the fair queen heleyne
In which book the process ye may se
To him how she was weddyd in the town
And of the siege laid unto the cite
By meneldy and king lamedoun
And many an other full worthy of renoun
On either pertye which that in bataile
Fro day to day each other did assail
Whereto should I tell or what should I write
The death of Ector or of achilles
Or whereto should I of new endyte
How worthy troylus was slain among the prees
The end of parts or of pallamydes
Or the slaughter of manly deyphebus
Or how his brother called helenus
Told before how it was great folly
That parts should wedde this queen helyne
And how Cassandra in her prophecy
On this wedding sore began complain
And for the constreynt of her hertely pain
How^ she way mad and ran about the town
Till she was caught and shet up in prison
All this matter ye may behold in deed
Set by and by within troy book
And how creseyde louyd dyamede
When worthy troylus she wilfully forsook
Of her nature a quarrel thus she took
To assaye both / if need were also to feyne
To take the third and leave them both tweyne
I pass over and tell of it no more
Neither by what meanys grekys wan the town
How Eneas neither how anthenore
Against king priam conspired falls treason
Neither how vliyes gate Paladion
The death of priam neither of Heccuba the queen
Neither how young pirrus slough young pollicene
Neither here to write it is not mine intent
Repair of grekys hom into their cuntre
After the cite at Ilyon was brent
Neither of their myscheef they had in the se
Neither how vliyes fond penolope
A true wife though he were long her fro
Throughoute all greece I can read of nomo
Of these matters thus I make an end
What fill of greeks after their viage
To troy book tho folk I send
Which have desire to se the surplusage
How grekys made first their passage
Towardys troy besegynge the cite
Read the story ye get no more of me
Here spekith bochas the auctour of this book against the surquedous pride of
them that trust in richesse saying these words unto them
yE proud folks that set your affiaunce
In strength / bewtye / or in high no^blesse
If ye considre fortunys variaunce
And coud a myrrour before your ^yen dress
Of king priam and of his great richesse
To se how he and his children all
From their noblesse suddenly been fall
Ector of knighthode called sours and well
Sad and demure and famous of prudence
Paris also in bewtye did excelle
And helenus also in perfight providence
Troylus in armies had great experience
Also deyphebus preuyd manly in his fone
Yet in the werre they were slain euerychone
Had not this king also as I can deuyse
Noble Eccuba which that was the queen
A daughter called Cassandra the wise
Her young sustre fair pollicene
Alas alas what may all such pride mean
For all be it their renoun spronge full far
Yet are these wymen deuouryd in werre
Was he not mighty and strong in all things
And had also of his aliaunce
Right worthy princes and many rich kings
And nygh all asie under his obeisaunce
Hold in his time most famous of puissaunce
Most renomed of richesse and tresoures
Till that fortune with her sharp shoures
When that he sat highest on his whele
This blind goddess began him to assail
Her froward malice he felt it full well
His gold his tresoure first it began to fail
And darken began his riall appariale
By which exaumple all proud men may se
The unsure trust the mutabylite
Which in this world is seen and found all day
In mids of statys in their magnyficence
Ebb after flow makes no delay
But halt her course there is no resistance
The tide abide not for no violence
Each man that standith of chaungis here in doubt
Must take his turn as it comes about
Let priam be to you a clear myrroure
Ye proud folks that set your affiaunce
In such veynglorye which fades as a flower
And has of bewtye here none attendaunce
The world to you cast a full bittre chance
For when ye wene sit highest at full
Than woll she rathest your bright feathers pull
Ye have warnyngys for to take heed
By ensaumple of other clear and right visible
How worldly blis is medlyd all with dread
And of your wits and resons be sensible
Thing seen at the ^ye is not incredible
And all this doctrine is to you in vein
If in your time ye have no chaungis seyne
Wherefore bochas unto your avail
Full prudently put you at this issue
First of all he yeueth you this counsel
To leave your vices and take you to virtue
And set your trust all holy in Ihesu
For he may best i^ myscheef help at need
Of worldly chaungis that ye their not dread
Here also John Bochos put a great preisinge and a commendacion of suertie
that stondith in pouertye under these words in sentence
THese great lordshippis these high dignytees
Cheef thing annexyd unto the regalye
When they sit highest in their sees
And roundaboute stant the chyualrye
Dread entrith in ^yll and envy
And unware change which no man may know
The hour when fortune wol make them loute low
They may well hold a statly great household
With a vein trust their power should ever last
Clad in their mantell of purpyll peerl and gold
And on the whele of fortune clymbe up fast
Like as she might neuyr down them cast
But ay the clymbynge high is at all
Alas the sorer is their unhappy fall
The fall of priam and of agamenoun
Out of right more to be compleynyd
When fortune had pullyd them down
And of malice has at them disdeyned
Than if they never to worship had atteyned
But their fallinge was the more grievous
Because tofore they were so glorious
O thou pouert meke humble and debonaire
Which that kepest the laws of nature
For sodeyn chaungys thou will not despair
So art thou fraunchised from fort^^es lure
All her assautis thou lowly do endure
That she may have no iurisdiccion
To enterupte thy possession
Thou set litell by all worldly richesse
Nor by his tresours which been transitory
Thou scornest them that their sheltrons dress
Toward batailes for conquest and victory
Thou despisest all shynynge of veynglorye
Laud of triumphs which co^querours have sought
With all her pillages thou settist them at naught
Thou despreysest all superfluyte
None infortune may change thy courage
And the shippis that sail by the sea
With marchaundise among the flodys rage
Their auentures and their pilous passage
Life / body / good / all put in a^venture
Oonly for lucre great richesse to recure
Of all such thing thou takyst litell head
Nor of that people that manners do purchase
Nor of pleters which for lucre and mede
Maynteyne quarrels and questis do enbrace
Thou them beholdest with a full still face
Their subtle werkynge sought out for the nonys
And suddenly depart from all atonys
And your coragis knightly does vpdresse
Again all titles holdith chaumpertie
Which apperteyne to falls auoutrye
Of mighty sampson which told his counseill to Dalida whereby he was deceived.
wHo was more mighty or strong than sa^pso^
None more deliver the bible bears witness
Without wepen he slough a feers lion
And for his enemies to him did express
His vn^outh problem anon he began him dress
Ageyn philistes and slough of them thretty
To pay his promys spoiled them by and by
^is problem was the text thus rehersynge
After the lettre in very sothefastnesse
There came out mete of a thing etynge
And fro the strong there went out swetnesse
But his wife of froward doubleness
Which ever wrouht to his disauaile
Of worthy sampson told the counsel
What is more strong than is a lion
Or more sote than honey in tastynge
But wymen have this condition
Of secret things when they have knowlegynge
^^^y bolne inward their hertys ay fretynge
O^^her they must dye or discure
So b^^^le of custum is their nature
This was the caas the lion that was deed
Again the son gopynge lay vpryght
Aswarme of been entryd in his head
Of whom there came honey anon right
And when sompson thereof had a sight
He fantasied in his opinion
Full secrely this proposicion
As ye have herd and began it forth purpose
That philistes to him it should expowne
Under a pain the troth to him unclose
But with his wife he pryuely began rowne
And she on sampson began complain and frown
And feynyngly so long upon him weep
That he not could his counseil from her keep
Which when she knew she made no taryenge
But plain and hole she began it to declare
Such double trust is in their weeping
To keep their tunges wymen cannat spare
Such weeping wives evil mot them fare
And all husbondes I pray god give them sorrow
That to them tell their counseyll eve or morrow
She told them hole she told it them not half
And sampson than began vopn them smyle
If ye not had herd it in my calf
Ye should not a found it a great while
Who may be sure where wymen list begyle
Though bookys sampson of strongth so commend
Yet durst he not against his wife offend
This mi^^^y sampson did also his pain
Three hundred foxis ones that he fond
He took their tails knyt them tweyne and tweyne
And amyd every each he set a fire bronde
And as they ran in philistes land
So furiously up and down they went
That they their fruits and their wynes brent
Eke by treason when he was ones bound
With new cordys as he lay and sleep
There three thousand which that sampson found
To have murdered him or that he took keep
He brake his bonds and up anon he lepe
Of an ass he caught a chaule bone
And a thousand he slough of them anon
He began to feynt and had a sodeyn lust
For to drink fadyd face and chere
And god sent him to staunch with his thruste
From the assys toth water cristall clear
Which that sprange ou^e large like a ryuere
Kefresshyd his spirit which before began dull
Till that he had of water drunk his full
After he went to Gazam the cite
Among all his enemies that were of great might
To his plesaunce where he did se
A full fair woman lay with her all night
And on the morrow long or it was light
Maugre the watch upon his shulders square
The gatys strong up to an hill he bare
And in a valey which called was Sore^
Full hot he louyd dalida the fair
On whom his heart was full hot set
She could her feyne so meke and debonayre
Make him such chere when that him list repair
But I dare call her dalida the double
Cheef root and cause of all his mortal trouble
He never drank wynes white ne read
Of Nazarees such is the governance
Rasoure ne shere touchyd never his head
For in long growing stondith her plesaunce
And this sampson most mighty of substance
Had all his force by influence of heuene
By heris weringe that were in noumbre seuene
It was full secre in every mannys sight
Among people told for an uncouth thing
Whereof sampson had so great might
Outward showed by force of his werkynge
But dalida with her flaterynge
Would never stynt enquerynge ever among
Till that she knew whereby he was so strong
She like a serpent daringe under flowers
Or like a worm that wrotith in a tree
Or like an addre of many fold colors
Right apperinge and fair upon to se
For shrowdyd was her mutabilite
With lowlihede and a fair pretense
Of true menynge under falls appearance
He meant troth and she was variable
He was feithfull and she was viltrewe
He was steadfast and she vnstabele
His trust ay one she louyd thing new
She weryd colors of many diverse hew
Instead of blewe which steadfast is and clean
She louyd chaungys of many diverse grene
But to the purpose for to condescende
When she of sampson knew all the priuete
Her falshede shortly for to comprehend
She made him sleep full softly on her kne
And a sharp rasoure after that took she
Shoof of his here large and of great lengyth
Whereby alas he lost all his strength
Damage in earth is none so grecious
As an ennemy which that is secre
Nor pestilence none so perilous
As falsnesse where he is preue
And specially in femynyte
For if wives be found variable
Where shall husbondes find other stable
Thus sampson was by dalida deceived
She could so well flatere forge and feyne
Which philistes when they have conceived
Unwarily bond him in a mighty cheyne
Cast him in prison put out his iyen tweyne
And of despite after as I find
At their quernes made him for to grind
They made a feast statly and solemn
When they had all this treason wrought
And to rebuke him scorn him and condemn
Blind sampson was before them brought
Which thing full sore greuyd him in his thought
Cast he would in his preuy mind
To avenge his blyndnesse su^me manner wey find
And when he had thus bethought him long
He made a child him pryuely to lead
To tweyne posts large square and strong
Enbracyd them or any man took head
And began to shake them without fere or dread
So sturdely among his fone all
That the temple is upon them fall
Thus he was auengyd on his fone
Which that falsely did again him strive
Slough in his dyenge god wot many one
More than he did ever before his live
And he was also the date to descriue
In israel the bible is mine auctour
Twenty year there judge and gouernoure
Lenuoye
THis tragedye yeueth in evidence
To whom men shall their cou^seil out discure
For recheles tunges for lack of prudence
Have do great harm to many a creature
When harm is done full hard it is to recure
Beware by sampson your counseyll well to keep
That dalida complain cry and weep
Whilom sampson for manhood and prudence
Israel had in governance and cure
Dauntyd lions through his magnificence
Made on a thousand a disconfiture
Full in any one have clean been all their live
Vndefoulyd kept their virginite
And su^me could ageyn all vices strive
Them to conserve in perfight chastity
Deuoyde of change and mutabilite
Though su^me other have therageyn trespacid
The laud of them is not therewith diffacid
And who ever of malice list accuse
Thise sely wymen touching variaunce
Let them remember and in their wits muse
Men be not ay stable in their constaunce
In this world there is no perseueraunce
Change is ay found in men and wymen both
On outher pertye be they never so wroth
No man should the virtuous atwite
Instead of him that did the trespace
Nor for a thief a true man endite
Nor for the gylty an Innocent manace
Good and wicked abide in every place
Their price / their lak / late them be reseruyd
To outher pertye as they have deseruyd
Though John bochas in his opinion
Again wymen list a process make
They that been good of condion
Should against no manner quarrel take
But lightly pass and their sleues shake
For ageyn good he no thing made
Who can conceive theffecte of this balade
The excuse of bochas for his writynge against mysgouernyd wymen instead of
lenuoye
yE wymen all that ye shall behold and se
This chaptre and the process read
Ye that been good found in your degree
And uertuous both in thought and deed
What bochas seith take ye none head
For his writing if it be decerned
Is not ageyn them that be well governed
For though it fall that one two or three
Have done amysse as therefore god forbede
That other wymen which stable and feythfull be
Should be atwytyd of their vngoodlihede
But moor commendyd for their womanhede
For this scripture if it be concernyd
Is ageyn them that be not well gouernyd
A gallyd hor^ the soth if ye list se
Who touchith him boweth his back for dread
And who is know untrue in his cuntre
Shrinkith his horns when men speak of falshede
But good wymen have full little need
To grutch or frown when the truth is lernyd
Though there be su^me which be not well gouernyd
Of Dalida / and queen Pasiphe
Though doubleness did their brydell led
Yet of lucrece / and penolope
The noble fame abrood does shine and sprede
Out of good corn men may the darnell wede
Wymen rebuke in their diffautys quernyd
And not touch them that be well gouernyd
Of mighty pirrus that slough pollicene which for his pride and auoutrye dyed
in poverty / slain at the last by horestes
BOchas musing in his remembrance
And consideryd in his fantasy
The unsure trust of worldly variaunce
Of men and wymen the change and the folly
The same time he saw a company
Of mighty princes full pitously weeping
To him appear their fortune compleynynge
Among other that put them self in p^^^es
Of mighty pirrus first he had a sight
That was the son of worthy achilles
Among Greeks the most famous knight
Most commended of manhood and of might
Son and next heir as books specify
Of Pelleus king of Thesal^^
This Achilles full manly of his heart
Hurt of Ector and his wound grene
Slough ector after or he did aduerte
The which achilles for love of pollicene
By compassynge or Eccuba the queen
Vndere Trety this grekis chaumpion
Was slain of paris within troy town
Who^s death to avenge pirrus in his tene
Furiously with face deed and pale
Slough afterward the said pollicene
And dismembryd all on pecis small
Which for to here is a pitous tale
That a knight so vengeable was in deed
To sle a maid quakynge in her dread
He could for Ire on her no mercy have
But with his sword most furious and wode
Merciles upon his faders grave
Like a tiraunt he shed her chaste blood
The deed horrible diffaced his knighthode
That to this the sclaundre and diffame
By new report reboundeth on his name
Po^tes say and specially onide
Write when grekis fro Troy should sail
How their shippis by an anchor did ride
Of th^^r purpose which long did them fail
But in this while he makith rehersaile
Out of the earth manacinge of chere
Of achilles an image did appear
To grekis said with a dedely face
I felt well mine honor and my glory
And my noblesse full lightly forth does pace
Unkind people out of your memore
Which by me had your conquest and victory
Your deuire does pollicene to take
And on my grave a sacrifise to make
With her blood look ye spare naught
To spring it ^ounde about my sepulture
Thus blood for blood with vengeance shall be bought
And for my death / the death she must endure
And hole the manner of this adventure
And how she died in her maidenhede
Methamorphose^s the process ye may read
In hasty vengeance set was all his joy
With thirst vnstaunchid / trojan blood to shede
He slo^gh priam the worthy king of troy
And into greece with him he did led
Adromada the story ye may read
Weddyd her and after in certain
By him she had worthy sons tweyne
But in repairynge home to his cuntre
As Eolus did his ships drive
I find he was a pirat of the se
And into Greece when he did aryue
Fortune unwarily began ageyn him strive
Forsook his wife let her live alone
Took another called hermyone
Which was that time in marriage
To horistes son of agamenon
And he alas of louys wilful rage
Took her by force to his possession
But of auoutrye folowith this guerdon
Sodeyn death / pouert / or shame
Open disclaundre / great myscheef / or diffame
Eke in his time thus pirrus as I read
Fill into myscheef and great pouerte
And with such meyne as he did led
He was a rouer and robbyd on the sea
And as poets reherce ye may see
Of such robbynge by sclaundre and diffame
This word pirate of pirrus took the name
And as the story after does devise
The said horistes began sekerly epsy
Where that pirrus did sacrifise
Tofore appollo that god to magnyfie
Full unwarily horistes of envy
Took a sharp sword or pirrus could aduert
Where that he stood and roof him to the heart
This was the fine of pirrus in substance
For all his pride and great presumpcion
Of falls auoutrye follows this vengeance
Loss of su^me membre pouert or prison
Or hatfull sclaundre by su^me occasion
Or sodeyn death shortly in sentence
Complete in pirrus by full clear evidence
Of Machaire and his suster Canace
AFtir this Pirrus came canace the fair
Te^ys distyllynge from her iyen tweyne
And her brother that called was machaire
And both they pitoussly began pleyne
That fortune began at them so disdeyne
Hyndrynge their fate by woeful adventure
Touching their love which was again nature
He was hi^ brother and her love also
As the story plenly does declare
And in a bed they lay eke both two
Reason was none why they should spare
But love that causes woe and eke welfare
Began ageyn kind so straungely deuyse
That he her womb made suddenly to arise
And finally mine auctoure berith witness
A child she had by her own brother
Which excelled in favor and fairness
For like to him of beauty was none other
But of their love so guyed was the rother
That Caribdis twene wyndis full contraire
Has Canace destroyed and machaire
For when their fader the manner did epsy
Of their werkynge which was so horrible
For Ire almoost he fill in frens^e
Which for to appese was an impossible
For the matter was froward and odible
For which plainly deuoyde of all pite
Upon their trespass he would auengyd be
The cause known the fader anon right
Last for their death of rigor to provide
For which machaire fled out of his sight
And from his face his presence began to hide
But woo alas his suster must abide
Merciles for their hateful trespace
Suffer death there was none other grace
First her fadre a sharp sword to her sent
In token of death for a remembrance
And when she wist plainly what he meant
And conceived his rigorous ordenaunce
With hole purpos to obey his plesaunce
She grutchith not but lowly of intent
Like a meke daughter to his desire assent
But or she dyed she cast for to write
A litell lettre to her brother dear
A dedly compleynt complain and endite
With pale face and a mortal chere
The salt terys from her iyen clear
With pitous sobbing set from her hertis bring
Distyllynge down to tempre with her ynke
The lettre of compleynt of Canace to her brother Machaire.
OVte of her swoune when she did abraide
Knowing no mean but death in her distress
To her brother full pitously she said
Cause of my sorrow rote of my heaviness
That whilom were cheef sours of my gladness
When both our joys by will were so disposyd
Under one key our hertis to be vnclosyd
Whilom thou were support and sekirnesse
Cheef reioisynge of my worldly joy
But now thou art the ground of my sikenesse
Well of wanhope of my dedely penance
Which have of sorrow gretest habundaunce
That ever yet had any creature
Which must for love the death alas endure
Thou were whilom my bliss and all my trust
Souereyn confort my sorrows to appese
Spring and well of all my hertys lust
And now alas cheef rote of my dissese
But if my death might do the any ease
O brother mine / in remembrance of tweyne
Death shall to me be plesaunce and no pain
My cruel fader most vnmerciable
Ordained has it nedys must be so
In his rigor he is so vntretable
All merciles he will that it be do
That we algate shall dye both two
But I am glad since it may be none other
Thou art escapyd my bestbelouyd brother
This is mine end I may it not asterte
O brother mine there is no more to say
Lowly besechinge with all mine hole heart
For to remember specially I pray
If it befall my litell son to dye
That thou may after sum mind upon us have
Suffer us both to be buried in a grave
I hold him streitly atwene my armies tweyne
Thou and nature leyde on me this charge
He giltles with me must suffer pain
And since thou art at fredam and at large
Late kyndnesse our love not so discharge
But have a mind where ever that thou be
Onys a day upon my child and me
On the and me depends the trespace
Touching our gyle and our great offense
But wela way most angelik of face
Our child young in his pure innocence
Shall ageyn right suffer dethis violence
Tender of lymmys god wot full giltles
The goodly fair that lies here specheles
A mouth he has but words has he none
Can not complain alas for none outrage
Nor grutcheth not but lies here all alone
Stille as a lamb most meke of his visage
What heart of stele could do to him damage
Or suffer him dye beholdinge the manner
And look benygne of his tweyne iyen clear
O thou my fadre to cruel is thy wreche
Harder of heart than any tygre or lion
To sle a child that lies without speech
Void of all mercy and remyssion
And on his mother have no compassion
His youth consideryd with lips soft as silk
Which at my breast lies still and souketh milk
Is any sorrow remembryd by writynge
Unto my sorrowful sighs incomparable
Or was there ever creature lyuinge
That felt of dole a thing more lamentable
For canfortles and vnrecuparable
Are thilke hepyd sorrows full of rage
Which have with woo oppressed my courage
Rekyn all my myscheuys in especial
And on my myscheef remember and have good mind
My lord my fader is mine enmy mortal
Experience enough thereof I find
For in his pursuit he has left behind
In destruction of the my child and me
Ruth all mercy and faderly pity
And the my brother avoided from his sight
Which in no wise his grace may atteyne
Alas that rigor vengeance and cruel right
Should above mercy be lady souereyne
But cruelte does at me so disdeyne
That thou my brother my child and also I
Shall dye exiled alas from all mercy
My fader whilom by many sundry sign
Was my socour and my supportacion
To the and me most gracious and benygne
Our worldly gladness our consolacion
But love and fortune has tournyd up so down
Our grace alas / our welfare / and our fame
Hard to recure so sclaundred is our name
Spot of diffamynge is hard to wasshe away
When noise and rumoure abroad do folk manace
To hindre a man there may be no delay
For hateful fame flies far in short space
But of us tweyne there is none other grace
Save only death / and after death alas
Eternal sclaundre of us thus stant the caas
Whom shall we blame or whom shall we atwyte
Our great offense since we may it not hide
For our excus reportis to respite
Mean is there none except the god cupide
And though that he would for us provide
In this matere to be our cheef refuge
Poetis say he is blind to a judge
He is depaynt like a blind archere
To make a right failynge discrecion
Holding no mesure nouther far nor nere
But like fortunys disposicion
All upon hap void of all reason
As a blind archere with arowes sharp ground
Of adventure yeueth many a mortal waunde
At the and me he wrongly did mark
Felly to hindre our fatal auentures
As far as phoebus shyneth in his arc
To make us refuse to all creatures
Called us tweyne unto the woeful lure^
Of diffame which will depte never
By new report the noise encresynge ever
Odious fame with swift wings flies
But all good fame envy does restreyne
Each man of other the defautys sees
Yet on his own no man will complain
But all the world outcrieth of us tweyne
Whose hatful ire by us may not be quemyd
For I must dye my fader has so demyd
Their life to amend or the lord do smite
Through negligence or it be to late
And or the sword of vengeance ker^e or bite
Into virtues their vicious life translate
Cherisshe rightwisnesse ageyn all wrong debate
With dread of god make them self strong
Than is no doubt they shall endure long
Who is not ware by others chastisynge
Other by him shall chastised be
Hard is that heart which for no writynge
For no doctrine nor none auctorite
For none exaumples will from his vices flee
To indurat is his froward intent
Which will not suffer his hardness to relent
The round droppis of the smoth rain
Which that discende and fall from aloft
On stonys hard at the iye as it is seyne
Perceth their hardness with their fallinge often
All be in touchenge water is but soft
The persynge caused by force nor puissaunce
But of falling by long contynuaunce
Semblably of right I dare reherce
Often redynge on bokys fructuous
The hertys should of prudent princes per^e
Synke in their mind and make them virtuous
To eschew all thing that is vicious
For what avails the exaumples that they read
To their redynge if contrary be the deed
Cu^nynge and deed who can comprehend
In ^^^re conceytis they been things tweyne
And if cu^nynge do the deed amend
Than atwene them is made a mighty cheyne
Anoble thing and right souereyne
For than of cu^nynge the labor is well spent
When deed follows and both been of assent
Thus John bochas procedynge in his book
Which in noumbre is called the secounde
Began for to write and his purpose took
To set in stories such as he had found
Of intent all vices to confound
By ensaumples which he did express
And at the beginning of his business
Mighty Saul to him did appear
King of israel pitously weeping
Dedely of face and with an hidous chere
His voice Ibroke by manyfolde sobbing
And to mine auctoure his sorrow compleynynge
Requerynge him to gydre when they met
First in his book his woeful fate to set
Anon after I of entencion
With pen in hand fast began me speed
As I could in my translacion
In this labor further to proceed
My lord came forth by and began to take heed
This mighty prince right manly and right wise
Gave me charge in his prudent auyse
That I should in every tragedy
After the process made mention
At the end set a remedy
With a lenuoye conveyed by reason
And after that with humble affeccion
To noble princes lowly it direct
By others falling them self to correct
And I obeyed his bidding and plesaunce
Under support of his magnificence
As I could I began my pen auaunce
Al be I was baren of eloquence
Following mine auctour in substance and sentence
For it suffised pleynly unto me
So that my lord my making took agree
How Saul king of Jerusalem borne of low degree / as long as he dred god was
obedient to him / and ruled by good counseile had many great disconfitures ^
but at the last for is pride / presumpcion / and great disobeisaunce he lost
his crown / and was slain by Philistees
Nihil insolencius quam potens rusticus Incipit liber secundus
tHis said saul of who^ I spoke to forn
Fulwel co^pacte and large of his stature
Of the line of beniamyn eke born
His fader Ceis was called ^ scripture
Whoos assis whilom left their pasture
Space of three days saul had them sought
Lost his labor and fond them naught
For they were gone out so fer on straye
So dis^^uered he ne could them mete
Till that a child him suynge all the way
Yaue him counsel his labor for to let
And that he should go to the prophet
Which was full famous hold in israel
Of whom the name was called Samuel
Which saul made in his house to dyne
Received him of great affection
And precept and ordinance deuyne
Samuel made no prolongacion
But shed the holy sacred vnccion
Upon the head of Saul down knelynge
And full devoutly of israel made him king
Of gods people to have governance
With ceptre and crown and hole the regalie
And his noblesse more mighty to auaunce
With meekness to rule his monarchy
God yau^ to him a sprite of prophecy
Which was great glory to his magnificence
Of future things to have precience
And while that he was meke and humble in deed
Void of pride and falls presumpcion
And prudent counseyle with him did led
Him to govern by good discrecion
He fond quiet through all his region
No foreyn enmy durst him to werreye
While he the lord mekely did obey
(...) enmy might again him recure
Through none emprises but sore did him dread
Made many great disconfiture
Through his force knighthode and ma^hede
On philistees and dauntyd eke in deed
Two mighty kings that one of anmyonytes
And another that governed Moabytes
^e was found strong and eke victorious
^he palestynesse bringynge to myschaunce
Again ydumes so mighty and famous
Through his mighty prudent governance
That he their pride brought unto myschaunce
Out^a^^d them of wisdom and manhede
Primo regum as ye may plainly read
(...) was ^ son called of one year
^ell when his regne began
^^able of heart and benygne of chere
Froward nor sturdy to no manner man
All that while love of the people he wan
The time I mean while he was just and stable
And in his works not found variable
But when that pride began his heart enhaunce
Wilfulness and falls malancolye
Outraied reason to have the governance
Of his old famous policy
And had forgetyn in his fantasy
To know the lord and mekely sue his law
God from his crown his grace began withdraw
The unkind worm of foryetfulnesse
In his heart had mined through the wall
When to god for his kyndnesse
Gave no laud / nor no thank attall
Which had him reised unto estate ryall
From pore degree among all his kyn allone
A synguler savor to set him in his trone
What thing in heart may be thought more froward
Than is sodeyn falls presumpcion
Of a wretch that came up of naught
To give him lordship and domynacion
And for to make a pleyn comparison
Men should of reason dread a lion less
Than the rudnesse of a crownyd ass
What thing to god is more abominable
Than pride vpreysed out of pouerte
And no thing gladly is found more vengeable
Than are wretches set in high degree
For from his stok kind may not fle
Each thing resorteth how far ever it go
To the nature which that it came fro
Fruit and apples take their talarage
Where they first grew of the same tree
And semblably each kynrede and lynage
Onys ayere it will none other be
By tokyn and sign at the iye as men may se
Draws commonly in every creature
Su^me teache to follow after his nature
I write not this in rebuke of pouerte
But for such only as that it deserve
God of his might as men be well expert
May them in virtue increase and concern
From all myscheef a poor man preserve
Reise him on height to domynacions
Through high noblesse of their conditions
By influence god may his grace shede*
Where he fyndeth cause only by meekness
A poor man to reyse him up in deed
Unto the estate of virtuous noblesse
For out of virtue comes all gentylnesse
In pore and rich make none excepcion
But them commend like their condicoin
A poor man which that is virtuous
And dredeth god in his pouerte
Each thing eschewynge that is vicious
And to his power does troth and equite
I dare right well what ever that he be
Putting no rebuke unto his kinrede
But call him gentle verily in deed
But king saul was contrarious
Disobeisaunce found in his werkynge
When god made him to be victorious
On amalech where agag was king
Him co^maundyd to spare no manner thing
Man nor woman be nor child socoure
But that his sword should al quycke thing devour
But saul wrought all in other wise
Each thing reserving that was fair to sight
And of intent to make a sacrifise
After his victory he shope him anon right
Fatest beestis he chase and has them dight
Toward the fire to make his offrynge
And fro death he spared agag the king
He was reprouyd afterward of samuel
To gods byddinge for he was contraire
As abiecte to regne in israel
That all good hope in him began disspaire
His grace / his might / began pall and appaire
His prophecy after has him failyd
And with afende he was also trauailyd
Thus from her whele fortune cast him down
Aualyd him from his royal se
And god also took away the crown
Both from him and his posterite
And set up david for his humylite
Loo how the lord his domys can deuyde
To enhaunce meekness and to abate pride
Saul endured in his frenzy
Awicked sprite so sore him did assail
Unto david ever he had envy
That he was hardy to enter in bataile
With a stafslynge void of plate and mayle
Slough Golias without fere or dread
Pullyd out his sword and smote of his head
At their repairynge home out of the field
When dauyd had slain thus golye
Young maidens when they beheld
The great victory they in their ermonye
In laud of dauyd thus began sing and cry
Saul has slain a thousand with his might
David ten thousand the lusty young knight
Saul disdeynyd and said frowardly
They grauntyd have a thousand to my name
And to the son hereof I say
Yaue ten thousand to encrece his fame
Which is to me a rebuke and a shame
Whereupon this saul fret with ^re
Of young david began the death conspire
In his heart he had a fantasy
Of their singing when that he took head
Demt it was a manner prophecy
That david preferrid should be in deed
And to the crown after him succeed
Thought his children as began dyuyne
Should be depryued of the royal line
Thus day by day saul weyes sought
To sle david plainly if he might
Al be it so that he no malice thought
But ever kept him lowly in his sight
Therefore good ever and grace on him a light
For ay the lord of his magnificence
Ageyn tirauntys preserves Innocence
And as the bible pleynly does us lere
This david had in his tender age
For his noblesse the kings daughter dear
Called Michol joined by marriage
And when that saul fill in any rage
David anon to aswage his woodnesse
Touchid his harp and brought him in gladness
Saul fuloft began dauyd to enchace
And werreye throughout all his lands
Through dese^^ys him pursue and manace
Of intent to have shet him up in bonds
Or to sle him if he come in his hondys
But finally god thorugh his ordenaunce
Preseruyd his knight from all manner myschaunce
Saul full often was brought to mischeef
Yet ay from death david did him save
And hereof this was a special preef
When david but his garnement in the cave
And mo tokyns if ye lift to have
Another time Dauyd also kept
The life of saul when he lay and slept
The case was this as they hosteynge
Not far asondre and saul lay and sleep
All his people about him slepynge
And unpurveyed like a flock of sheep
Of which thing dauyd took good keep
Down descendyd and made no delay
Came to the tent where king saul lay
The spear of saul stondynge at his head
David took it and went his way anon
Of his coming there was no man took head
For saul slept and his men echon
And when that he up to the hill was gone
Toward saul ageyn he cast his look
Made anoyse that all his knights woke
First to abnor prince of his chyualrye
Dauyd seyde these words in sentence
Abnor quod he thou have done great folly
This day showed a great negligence
To suffer of saul the magnificence
In peril stand and none head take
About his person to make his knights wal^e
Thou art to blame for thy rechelesnesse
To leave the king stand in so great a dread
In sleep to have more sauoure and swetnesse
Than of his life to take heed
Such negligence requires for his mede
Death and turment by rightful judgment
About a prince when folk be negligent
And thou list to se an euydence
How that his life stood in Iuperdye
Se here his spear and give thereto credence
How unprovided ye were in your pertye
Saul nor thou ye may it not deny
Your life / you death / your power / your puissaunce
This day god put hole in my governance
But me to aquyte of your Innocence
As every man should unto his king
And to declare in me was none offense
Ageyn his noblesse in will nor in werkynge
As god wot that knows every thing
That I never by no conspiracye
Wrouht nor compassyd again his regalye
^O here exaumple of perfight patience
Ageyn malice to show kyndnesse
Where saul showed his mortal violence
David aquit him with suffraunce and goodness
The tyrant venquesshyd by his prudent meekness
Men ageyn troth may well a werre gynne
But at the end the palm he does ay win
For of this story if that ye take heed
Saul is fall for his frowardness
Into myscheef and into sodeyn dread
For Philistees the bible berith witness
With a great power began their wardys dress
Upon king saul auengyd for to be
Their tentys pight beside Gelboe
Whereof king saul astonyed in his heart
Had lost his sprite of knightly hardynesse
And specially when he did aduerte
Prophet was none his armies to redress
Of future things troth to express
In israel which cast him in great dread
Because that time samuel was deed
For saul had cast out all dyuynes
From israel and each from dyuyneresse
Not withstanding the palestynesse
Were rys ageyn his power to oppress
And he ne knew no manner sorceresse
Of whom he might any counseyll take
And he of god that time was forsake
In this wise he stood disconsolate
Counseyl of god nor prophet knew he none
But a man most unfortunate
Ungraciously he sped him forth anon
And secrely this saul is forth gone
To a woman that should him read and wysse
In israel called a phetonesse
Which is a name as clerkys written all
And office who that takes head
Soulis of men ageyn to clepe and call
I mean such that tofore were deed
Which is a thing strange for to read
That wymen should who so list to lere
Make souls of deed men appear
Uncouth and strange is their opinion
And to my wit a manner impossible
Not according me seems to reason
Nor like a thing which that is credible
That a soul of nature invisible
Might appear or show visibly
Unto iyen which that been bodily
But or that I any ferther flitte
Lest I were hold to presumptuous
To deuynes this matter I committee
And wise clerks that been virtuous
In their wits subtle and corious
To conclude as it does them seem
In this matter a troth for to deem
Whether it was the soul of sconuell
Or other sprite that she did call
Which that told the king of israel
Of the bateyll that should after fall
His auentures and his myscheuys all
And of his death he told also in deed
And how dauyd should after him succeed
Because only of his disobeysaunce
As it is written / and for his rechelesnesse
On amelech for he took not vengeance
Thus the sprite bare to him witness
Whereof Saul fill in greteate heaviness
Knowing no mean to escape out of this doubt
But take his fortune as it comes about
Told him also his enemies were so wroth
The philistees beside Gelboe
In that battle he and his children both
Should dye that day of necessite
His chivalry shall scounfited be
Of his regne there is no longer date
For god from him his kingdom will translate
And thus saul retournyd is ageyn
His meny after brought to discounfiture
And when he saw all his people slain
And how there was no mean to recure
In that dedly woeful adventure
He bad his squier / take his sword as blyue
And through the heart that he should him ryue
That his enemies which were uncircumcised
Should have no power in story it is found
To fall upon him as they have devised
To give him his last fatal wound
His high noblesse at myscheef to confound
But his squier for fere of god and dread
Would not assent to do so foul a deed
To slay his lord he greatly was aferde
A thing hatfull in every mannys sight
But saul took the pomell of his sword
And in the ground full deep anon it pight
And in all have possible that he might
Made the point in his furious pain
To perce his heart and part even on tweyne
The philistees anon as he was deed
Spoilyd him of his riall armure
Dismembryd him and smote of his head
And in tokyn of their disconfiture
Took the spoils with all their besy cure
And thereof made in all their best intent
To astraoth of pride a great present
Thus was saul slain in sentence
Of philistees upon Gelboe
Forsake of god for inobedience
Abiecte also from his royal fee
And thus for lacking of humylite
Of god he was for ever set aside
Lo here the end of surquedye and pride
Lenuoye
Have mind of saul which of estate riall
From low degree was called for makenesse
But presumpcion made him have a fall
Of god abject for his frowardness
Lost his crown the bible berith witness
And cause was for his disobeysaunce
To goddys bidding he yaue none attendaunce
God not axeth no more of man atall
But hole heart without doubleness
For all the giftys which in especial
He yaue to man of high goodness
But he chastises all unkindness
Such as been rebel for to do plesaunce
And to his bidding give none atendaunce
Noble princes virtue most principal
You to conserve in your high noblesse
Is to emprente in your memorial
Feith equity all wrongs to redress
To sustain troth and rightwisnesse
And tofore god hold heavenly the balaunce
And his byddinge give hole your attendaun^^
Acommendacion of Bochas upon the virtue of obedience
Virtue of virtues most of excellence
Which that have most souereyn suffisaunce
Is the virtue of true obedience
Which set all thing in rightful governance
For ne were not this prudent ordenaunce
Su^me to obey and above to guye
Destroyed were all worldly policye
Where that virtue and high descrecion
Auoidyd have from them all wilfulness
By title only of dominacion
Truly living upon reghtwisnesse
Wrong and errors justly to redress
Of truth I may rightwell afferme and say
The people mekely their biddynge should obey
This noble virtue of feythfull obeisaunce
Establisshed upon humylyte
Which includes no double variaunce
In all regions and in each country
Causes welfare / joy / and prosperity
And as virtue cheef and souereyne
All vicious riete it pleynly does restreyne
Obedience eke as men may se
Falsnesse exileth and all rebellion
For by tempraunce right and equite
Stant the welfare of every region
For the meekness and low subieccion
Of comontees hold up the regalies
Of lordshippes and of all monarchies
And no doubt when lordshippes of intent
Besy been the souereyne lord to queme
To their subiettes do right Judgment
In conscience as right and reason deem
Than shall their crown and dyademe
Upon their head persevere and fresshly shine
And make subiettis to their biddynge en^lyne
Thus obe^saunce plainly at a word
In such as have lordship and souereynte
Done of intent to their sovereign lord
Shall cause them reign in long prosperity
And their subiettes of humilite
For their noble famous governance
Ay to be ready under their obeisaunce
For who that serves the lord of lords all
And has the people in his subieccion
God will keep him that he shall not fall
Long preserve his dominacion
But ageynwarde when wisdom and reason
Been ouermaistred with censualite
Farewell the flowers of their felicite
Obedience blunteth the sharpness
Of cruel swerdys in tyrauntys hondys
And meekness appeseth the felnesse
Of hasty vengeance breketh on two the bonds
Eke patience set quiet in londys
And where thise three contune in comontees
Long pees perseuereth in kyngdoms and citees
Obedience does also restreyne
Conspiracions and falls collusions
When she stant vnpartyd not atweyne
There is no dread of no discencions
For she combyneth the true opinions
In the hertys of people full well before provided
Under princes to stand hole vndeuyded
Where princes be meke humble and debonaire
Towardys god of hole affeccion
Their subiettis be gladly not contrary
In their ceruise by no rebellion
For there is found no division
But head and members each for his party
Be so gouernyd by prudent policy
Contrariously saul was put down
Abject of god for his obstinacy
Put from his ceptre / his crown / his region
Of israel lost all the monarchy
For he list not make his alye
Of frowardness and wilful negligence
This noble virtue called obedience
For as it longs in kingdoms and citees
Under a key of un beniuolence
Princes kings to govern their sees
So apperteyneth due reverence
To their subiettes by obedience
To obey their lords as they be of degree
By title of right in every comonte
For obeisaunce if it be discernyd
With argus iyen who that takes head
As right requereth is not well governed
When the members presume ageyn the head
Of governance there is no perfight* speed
From unity they goo afrowarde weye
When subiettis their princes disobeye
How king Roboam for gyuynge feith to young counseyle lost the benevolence of
his people and dyed a fool
Unto John bochas in order next ther^ ca^
With full great dole and lamentacion
The young king called Roboam
Son and next heir to Salamon
Entringe by title of just succession
Besought mine auctour to make of his folly
And of his falling a pitous tragedy
First when he entryd into his region
Twelve tribus gouernynge in deed
Ruled him silf by will and no reason
Kept his subiettes pleynly as I read
Not under love but under froward dread
Of old wise to his great disauaile
He despised the doctrine and counsel
He demenyd as it was well couth
His ceptre / his crown / and his regalie
By such folk as floured in their youth
Could of custum their wits well apply
To blende him falsely with their flaterie
Which is a stepmoder called in substance
To all virtue and all good governance
Alas it is great dole and great pity
That flaterye should have so great favor
Which blinds princes that they may not se
Misteth the iyen of every gouernoure
That they can not know their own error
Falls honey shed ay on their sentence
A fool is he that yeueth to them credence
They may be called the deuyls tabourers
With froward sownys ceris to fulfill
Or of Cures the perilous botelers
Which gall and honey down distill
Whoos drinks ben both amerous and ill
And as clerks well devise cu^ne
Wors than the drynkes of Cirenes tu^ne
Erys of princes full well they can enoynt
With the soft oil of adulacion
And their termys most subtly appoint
Each thing concludynge with falls decepcion
Ay blandisshinge with amerous poison
And finally as the poet says
Their feith of custum concludes with vnfeith
Flourynge in wordys though there be no fruit
Double of heart plesaunte of langage
Of true menynge void and destitute
In mustrynge outward pretend a fair visage
Who trustith them fyndeth small advantage
By appearance and glorious fressh showing
Princes deceyuynge and many worthy king
Roboam can bear full well witness
From auoidynge folks that were true
How he was hyndryd by flaterye and falnesse
By them that could forge out tales new
Whoos counseile after sore did him rewe
And with their feyned falls suggestion
Greatly abridgyd his domynacion
He dempte him self of more auctorite
Of folly youth and of presumpcion
Than was his fader in great rialtie
And this pompous falls opinion
Came into his conceit by adulacion
For flaterers bare to him witness
How he excelled his faders high noblesse
He did great rigor and oppression
Upon his people as it was well prouyd
And to find sum mitigacion
They in matters which that have them greuyd
Of their tributes for to be releuyd
Besought he would relece them in their need
But all for naught he took thereof none head
All old counseile from him he set aside
And refusyd their doctrine and their lore
And by falls counseyll of folks full of pride
His pore lieges he oppressyd sore
And ten kynredys anon without more
For tyranny and mysgouernaunce
From him withdrough the troth and ligeaunce
This of the king conceived the rigor
The people anon of Indignacion
Stoned adoram which was collectour
Of the tributis in all his region
From him depertynge by rebellion
Whereof astonyed to avenge his great unright
In to Jerusalem took anon his flight
And when they were pertyd from roboam
The ten kynredys by division
Chase them a king called Jeroboam
And roboam within his royal town
To be auengyd of their rebellion
And for to do on them cruel iustise
An hundred thousand he made anon to arise
With Jeroboam he cast him for to mete
And all at onys set in iuperdye
But rameus the prophet bad him leete
And from the werre withdraw his pertye
And more the quarrel for to justify
Of his people froward departing
It was goddys will done for a punysshynge
Touching the surplus of his governance
His royal byldynge of many fair cite
His great rich famous suffisaunce
Of wine and oil having great plenty
And how his empire encreacyd yerys three
Eke how that time he rightful was in deed
In Josephus his story ye may read
Of his children borne in right line
Eightene wives as made is mention
I find he had and many concubyne
Sons and daughters by procreacion
And how his richesse and great possession
That time encreacid as it is well know
To god above while that he bare him low
But as this auctour makes rehersaile
In his encres and augmentacion
Meekness in heart in him began wast and fail
And pride entryd with falls presumpcion
Virtue despisynge and all religion
After whose vices as seith this same book
Wicked exaumple of him the people took
After the manners where they be good or ille
Vsyd of princes in diverse regions
The people is ready to use and fulfill
Fully the tracis of their conditions
For lords may in their subiections
So as them list who so can take heed
To vice or virtue their subiettis led
Thus Roboam for his transgressions
In Josephus as it is devised
And for his froward falls opineons
Only for he all virtue has despised
Of god he was rightfully chastised
In jerusalem his cheef royal town
Of his enmyes besegyd enuyron
The king of egypt a sege about him laid
With so great people that socour was there none
Albe it so that roboam abrayde
And praide god deliver him from his fone
To avoid of mercy his enemies euerychone
But god list not grant his praiere
But him chastised like as ye shall here
First his cite and his royal town
Delivered was he knew no better socoure
Under a feynyd falls composicion
For at their entering void of all favor
Keeping no covenant took all the tresoure
Within the temple having no pite
But ladde it home to egypt their cuntre
And to reherce it is a great dole
How Roboam as Josephus does declare
Was inly proud and therwithall a fool
And of all wisdom destitute and bare
Vnmerciable his people for to spare
Hatynge good counseyle and so in his regalye
Regnynge a fool and so I let him dye
Lenuoye
PHilosophers conclude and devise
In their books of good experience
That counseylours / sad / expert / and wise
True of their word stable of their sentence
Hasty nor recheles for no violence
Keep and preserve the troth I da^^ attain
Noblesse of princes fro mische^^^^d diffame
Hasty youth and rancoure in contrary wise
Which have to will all their aduertence
Except them self all other men despise
Through their vnbridelyd furious insolence
Nothing acqueynted with wisdom nor prudence
Bring ayenwarde whereof they be to blame
Putting his noblesse in myscheef and diffame
King roboam ageyn right and iustise
To young foles yaue faith and most credence
Cruelly his subiettis to chastise
which put his people fro his benyuolence
Through ten kynredys from his obedience
Which was to him by record full great shame
Putting his noblesse in myscheef and diffame
Noble princes do wisely advertise
In persevering of your magnyficence
Of old expert not blent with couetyse
Take your counseile and do them reverence
Eyed as argus in their high providence
Which conserve by report of good name
Noblesse of princes from myscheef and diffame
A chaptre descryuinge how princes being hedeys of their comontees should
have noble chyualrie true Iuges their comontye to govern etc.
wHat erthely thing is more deceyuable
Than of princes the pomp and veinglorye
Which wene stond in their estatis stable
As they the world had co^querid by victory
And suddenly be put out of memory
Their fame cloudyd alas and their noblesse
With a derke shadow of foryetfulnesse
Whereof comes the famous clear shynynge
Of emperors in their consistories
Or whereof comes their laud in reportinge
Save that clerks have written their histories
Or where now conquestys transitories
Or their triumphs where should men them find
Nadde writers their prowess put in mind
Reken up all and first the worthy nine
In high nobles which had never peers
The ma^^^ actis which clearly did shine
Their fame vpborne above all the nine sterrys
With loud sownys of famous clarioneris
Their glorious palms if they be well preysid
By low labors of commons was first reised
Make a likeness of these great images
Coriously corue out by entaile
Head / arms / body and their fresshe visages
Without / fete or legs may not veil
To stand upright for nedys they must fail
And semblably subiectis in comontees
Reise up the noblesse of princes in their sees
As head and members in ymagys been one stone
Outher one stok by cumpas vndeuyded
And be proporcion their feturys euerichon
Set in true order as nature has prouydyd
So that all errors through craft by circumcided
The head highest by custum as men know
The body amyd the fete beneth low
Mighty princes for their high renoun
As most worthy shall occupye the head
With wit memory and iyen of reason
To keep their members fro mischeef and dread
Like their degrees take of them good head
With clear forsight of a prudent thought
Their fete preserve they err naught
There must be hands and armies of diffence
Which shall the image manly keep and give
From all assautis of foreyn violence
Which shall be named nobleste of chivalry
Their true office justly to magnyfie
Sustain the church and make them self strong
To se that wydowes and maidens have no wrong
Prudent iuges as it is skyll and right
To punysshe wrong and surfetys to redress
In this image shall ocupie the sight
For love or hate by dome of rightwisnesse
For friend or fo his iugementis dress
So egally the laws to sustain
In their works that none error be seyn
Amyd this image there is a body set
An aggregate of people and degrees
By perfyte pees and unity yknet
By thestates that govern comontees
As meires / prouostes / and burgeis in citees
Marchauntis olso which seek sundry londys
With other craftis which live by their hondis.
And as a body which stant in health
Felith no greef of no froward humors
So every common contynueth in great health
Which is demenyd with prudent governors
That can appese debatis and errors
The people keep from all contrauersie
Causynge the welfare to encreace and multiply
This body must have a soul of life
To quike the members with goostly mocions
Which shall be made of folk contemplatif
The church co^myttyd to their possessions
Which by their holy conuersacions
And good exaumple should as sterrys shine
By grace and virtue the people enliunyne
Upon the light of their conditions
Of this body dependith the welfare
For in their techinge and pridicacions
They should troth to high and low declare
And in their office for no dread ne spare
Vices correct like as they are hold
Since they been herdys of cristes fold
Following upon of intent full clean
Laborers as ye have hard devised
Shall this body bear up and sustain
As feet and legs which may not be despised
For true labor is Justly auctorisied
And nere the plough vpholden by traueile
Of kings princes farewell all gouernaile
Thus first if princes governed by by right
And knighthode suffer the people to have no wrong
And troth in iuges show out his light
And forth in citees with love he draw a long
And holy church in virtue be made strong
And in his labor the plough ne feyne naught
Than by proporcion this image is well wrought
This matter hole for to exemplify
King Roboam for a falls oppression
And for his wilful froward tyranny
Lost a great pertye of his region
Wherefore let princes considre of reason
God set the people for lords advantage
And to be oppressyd with seruage
Upon su^me princes bochas does complain
Such as have a custom and manner
Ageyn their subgettes ungoodly to disdeyne
And of pride to show them froward chere
Counseyleth them to remember and lere
As this chaptre does finally diuyse
First out of lordship all labor did arise
How Mucyus Sceuola slough an Innocent instead of king Porce^na that laid
siege to Rome.
When king porce^na with his chivalry
Again romans a werre first began
The town besegynge upon each pertye
With great puissaunce brought of tuskan
In the cite there was a knightly man
Mucius Sceuola which cast in their distress
To break the siege through his high prowess
Let arm him self clean in plate and maile
For common profit to auaunce his courage
King porcenna proudly to assail
A time provided to his auantage
Through the sege to make his passage
And finally at his in coming
Iuperte his person for to sle the king
But like as tellith titus lyuius
Where Porcenna sat in his royal see
This Senatoure this manly Mucius
Saw a prince of great auctorite
The king resembling clad in one liuere
Atweyne decernynge no manner variaunce
Slough that prince of very ignorance
But when he knew that he did fail
To sle porcenna enmy to the town
And saw he had lost all his travail
He made a pitous lamentacion
Because he did execusion
Of ignorance ageyn his own intent
To spare a tiraunt and sle an Innocent
For which he was with him self full wroth
That he was found so negligent in deed
And with his hand unto a fire he goth
Made it brenne bright as any glede
Both nerf and bone and his flessh to shede
His hand consumynge on pecis here and yond^^
And from his arm made it pert a sondre
And as the story declares unto us
This manly man this noble senatoure
Before time was called mucyu^
Which for the common did many great labor
And for the uncouth hasty fell rigor
Done to himself the romans all
Sceuola they did him after call
As much to say by langage of that land
Who take a right the exposion
As a man which is without an hand
And after him by succession
All his ofspring^ borne in the town
In remembrance for to encrece his fa^^
Of Sc^uola ^are after him the na^^
By this exaumple and many other moo
If men list here corages to awake
They should se what peril and what woo
For common profit men have undertake
And whilom ^ru^us for Lucrecis sake
Tarquyn chacyd for his transgression
And kings all out of rome town
Touching Lucrece exaumple of wifly troth
How young Tarquyn her falsely did oppress
And after that which was to great a routh
How she her self slough for heaviness
It needs not rehece the process
Since that Chaucere cheef poet of bretayne
Wrote of her life a legende sovereign
Rehersinge there among other things
Each circumstaunce and each occasion
Why romans exilid first their kings
Never to regne after in their town
As old cronicles make mention
Remembringe also the unkindly great outrage
By encrece done to Dido of Cartage
Eke other stories which he wrote in his live
Full notably with every circumstaunce
And their fatis pitously did discryue
Like as they fill put them in remembrance
Wherfo^ if I should my pen auaunce
After his making to put them in memory
Men would deem it presumpcion and vein glory
For as a sterre in presence of the su^^e
Lesith his fresshnesse and his clear light
So my rudnesse under skies du^ne
Dares full low and has lost his sight
To be comparyd ageyn the bemys bright
Of this poet wherefore it were but vein
Thing said by him to write it new again
How lucrece oppressed by Tarquyn slough her self
But at Lucrece s^yne I will a while
It were ^ite her story for to hide
Or sloth the pen of my rude style
But for her sake all matters set aside
Also my lord bad I should abide
By good auice at leyser to translate^
The doolfull process of her pitous fate
Following the tracis of collucyus
Which wrote of her a declaracion
Most lamentable / most doolfull / most pitous
Where he discriueth the dolorous treason
Of her constreyned falls oppression
Wrought and compassid by unware violence
The light vntroublyd of her clear conscience
Her fader whilom called Spurius
Her worthy husbonde named collatyn
Which by the luxury and treson odious
And vicious outrage of sextus proud Tarquyn
Oppressyd was and brought unto her fyn
Whoos dedely sorrow in Inglissh for to make
Of pitous ruth my pen I feel quake
This said Tarquyn this evil auisyd knight
This slaundred man most hateful for his deed
Came like a thief alas upon a night
With nakyd sword when noman took head
Upon Lucrece she quakinge in her dread
Lyenge abed far from her folks all
And knew no refuge for help for to call
He manasynge in his froward intent
On her beholdynge with a furious chere
That with his sword but she would assent
Her and a boy he would prente I fere
Suchone as was most ougly of manner
Most unlikely of person and of fame
Thus he her thrat for to slaundre her name
But his intent when she did feel
And saw no mean of her woeful chance
The morrow after she list no thing concele
Told her husbonde holy the governance
Him requerynge for to do vengeance
Upon this crime said like a true wife
She would her heart perce with a knyfe
In this matter this was her fantasy
Better was to dye than to live in shame
And less ill to put in Iuperdye
Her mortal body than her good fame
When honor dies farewell a mannys name
Be^^^^^t were out of his life diseuere
Than slanderous fame to sle a man for (...)
But to that purpos her husbond said nay
Her fader also was thereto contrary
Making a promyce without more delay
To do vengeance how they wilnat tarry
To her declaryngt with reasons debonarie
Under these words troth and right co^serued
To sle her self she has no thing deserved
For suddenly and also vnauisyd
As a fool is trappyd in the snare
By unware fraud upon the practisyd
Thou were disceyued pleynly to declare
Ha^inge this conceyt hard is to repare
The name of them which falsely be diffamyd
When wrong report the high renown has shamyd
Touching thy person I dare offerme and s^yn
That it were a manner impossible
And like a thing which never yet was seyn
That thy worship was found corruptible
But steadfast ay and indivisible
Vnptyd virtue and made strong
And now desirous to avenge thy wrong
On thy Iniurye we shall auengyd be
Consideryd first the dedely heaviness
Which thou suffridest by great aduersite
When the auoutour thy beutye did oppress
And reioysynge by a falls gladness
Maugre thy will as a thief by night
The encombred of very force and might
But if thou would leave all thy mourning
And restreyne thy importable woo
Sone should thou se an egall punysshinge
Upon thy most froward mortal foo
To warn all other they shall no more do s^
In chastisinge of falls auoutrie
The and thy renoun of right to magnifye
What was diffasinge to thy true intent
Though his youth vnbridelyd went at large^
So for to aforce a cely innocent
Whoos wickydnesse ought to bear the charge
And we of right thy conscience discharge
The joy unlawful of his false plesaunce
With double palm thyn honor does auaunce
Conceive and se o thou my Lucrece
How that reason and good discrecion
Should thy trouble and thy mourning ceo^
Of right restreyne thy opinion
So rechelesly to do punycion
With knyf or hand to sle thy silf alas
For others gilt and did no trespass
Latbe Lucrece / ^atbe all thy dool
Cece thy complaynt and thy woo restreyne
Should I fro the live alone all fool
And thy death perpetuelly complain
To put thy fader in importable pain
Of our welfare be not so recheles
To dye and leave our children moderles
Of prudence eke thou ought for to se
And advertise only of reason
Though of force thy body corrupt be
Thy soul inward and thyn entencion
Fraunchisyd been from all corrupcion
Offense is none considre in thyn intent
With will and heart give thereto full consent
Thou were nakyd in thy bed lyenge
Alone unware slepinge and void of might
Suspeciousles all of his coming
That time namely because that it was night
A feerfull woman and he a manly knight
Al be it so vnknightly was his deed
With nakyd sword to assail thy womanhede
He might thy body by force well oppress
By sleighty weyes that he had sought
But well wo^e I for all his sturdynesse
He might never have maistry of thy thought
The body yeldyd the heart yeldyd him naught
Ye were tweyne / thou feeble / and he right strong
Thy troth afforcyd he werker of the wrong
Where might thou have greter preice or laud
All right considred troth and equite
First counterpeysed his force and sleighty fraud
Than to persevere in femynite
With thought enchaunged and infragilite
Of woman head to have an heart stable
What thing in the might be more comendable
It is well^know^ thou were of heart ay one
To all falls lustys contrary in governance
More like an Image ^erued out of a stone
Than like a woman flesshly of plesaunce
The tyrant fond in chere and countenance
Which ever after by womanly victory
Shall Be ascryued to thyn encreace of glory
Thy fader Brutus has the well excused
Mysilf also thy blood and thy kynrede
On this matter late no more be musyd
To sle thy silf or do thy sides blede
Certys Lucrece thou have full litell need
It were great wrong by all our judgment
To spare a tyrant and sle an Innocent
Thy silf to murdre to su^me it would seem
Thou were gilty where as thou art clean
Diverse wits diversely will deem
Report thing thou none did mean
For which thou shall patiently susteene
Till thy chaste wifly Innocence
May se him punysshed for his violence
Folk will not deem a person Innocent
Which wilfully when he is not culpable
Yildeth him self to death by judgment
And never was before of no gilt portable
His own dome upon him self vengeable
Causes the people though their report be naught
To deem a thing that never was done ne wrought
To be auengyd upon thyn own life
In excusing of thy dedly fame
To show thou art a true weddyd wife
Wenynge by death to get the a name
In this device thou art greatly to blame
Where thou yet know thyn honor clerly shine
To give the people matter to deuyne
And with that word lucrece did abrayde
Full dedely both of look and chere
To them ageyn even thus she said
Lathe husbonde / lathe my fader dear
Speak no more to me of this matere
Lest men dempt in hindringe of my name
I dred death more than falls diffame
Your counseyle is I shall my life conserve
To sorrow and sclaundre but no gladness
But less ill it is at an hour to sterue
Than ever languyssh in sorrow and heaviness
Death makes an end of all worldly distress
And it was said since full yore ago
Better is to dye than ever to life in woo
When that worship in any creature
Is slain and deed by sclaunderous report
Better is of death the dreadful pain endure
Than by falls noise ay to lif in discomfort
Where new / and new diffame has his resort
Never dies but quickens by the outrage
Of hateful tunges and venymous langage
Do your deuer to halowe and make stable
The chaste chaumbres of wifly governance
For in this case if ye be variable
On falls auoutrye for to do vengeance
There shall follow everlasting remembrance
How true spousaile as ye have hard devised
In your cite broke and not chastised
If ye be found in such case necligent
To punyssh auoutours of right as your charge
Through your sloth as ye were of ^assent
Luxuere vnbridelyd shall re^^e abroad at large
Who shall than your conscience discharge
Or what woman stand in sekirnesse
Of Lucrece afforcyd the clennesse
O dear husbonde what joy should it be
To thyn estate in any manner place
Like as thy wife to cherissh me
Or in thyn arms me goodly to enbrace
The gilt horrible considered and trespace
By Tarquyn done alas and welaway
Which in my person may never be washed away
And fader mine how should thou me call
After this day thyn own daughter dear
Which alas refuce of wymen all
That to thy plesaunce was whilom most entere
Within thy house when I did lere
By clear exaumple of manyfolde doctrine
All that perteyned to virtuous discipline
Which I have lost now in my days old
Dispeyred it to recure ageyn
Mine own children I dare not them behold
Because the womb in that they have leyn
Diffoulyd is and pollute in certain
Which was tofore in chastity conseruyd
Chastise the auoutre as he has deseruyd
And for my part to speak in words few
Longer to live I have no fantasy
For where should I out my face show
Or dare appear in any company
Since a derke spot of falls auoutrie
Shall evermore whether it be falls or true
Into mine hindrynge the sclaundre to renew
Lust afforcid has a falls appetite
Of freelte includyd in nature
Maugre the will there follows a delight
As su^me folkys say in every creature
Good fame lost full hard is to recure
And since I may my harmys not redress
To you in open my gylt I will confess
All be I was ageyn my will oppressyd
There was a manner constreyned lust in deed
Which for no power might not be redressyd
For feblenesse I stood in so great dread
For which offense death shall be my mede
Since lever I have with su^me edge tole
To sle my silf than live in slaundre and dole
O fader mine spare and have pite
And dear husbonde rue on mine offense
Goddys and goddessys called of chastity
To my trespass grant an indulgence
For of my gylt to make a recompense
Where that venus gate in me a vauntage
Death shall redress and chastise mine outrage
For if I should make a delay
To perce my breast with sharpness of a knife
Men would deem and say fro day to day
To make my sclaundre more opyn and more rife
How that I was more tender of my life
Than of my worship which to great a shame
To love my life more than my good name
In this matter no witness is so good
To put away all falls suspecion
As with a knife to shede my heart blood
I might not make a better purgacion
To all folk that have discrecion
Than finally by my death to excuse,
The gilt horrible of which men me accuse
Goo forth my soul pure and inmortall
Cheef witness of mine Innocence
Tofore tho iuges which been infernal
First Mynos king to deem my conscience
With Radamanthus to give a sentence
Like my desert that it might be seen
In wifly troth how that I was clean
Thou erthely body which through thy fairness
Were to auoutry full great occasion
Of thy blood shed out the redness
And by thy sides late it rail down
Stere and exite the people of this town
To do their deuer within a litell while
For love of tarquyn all kings to exile
And first I pray my husbonde most entere
Of this vengeance to make no delay
With help and socoure of my fader dear
To punysshe the auoutour in all the have ye may
Late him take his wages and his pay
Like as ye se and pleynly now concey^e
For his offense the death I do receive
And suddenly or they might aduert
She took a knife and with great violence
Through the breast even unto the heart
She made it glide there was no resistance
Full pale and deed fill down in their presence
And by occasion of this pitous deed
Tarquyn exiled and holy his kinrede
For which cause by record of writynge
Was there never in Rome the cite
After that day no man crownyd king
As in chronicles ye may behold and se
Thus for luxury and their cruelte
Their tyranny and falls extorcion
They were exiled out of rome town
How rome after was gouernyd / and virginea by her fader slain
GOuernyd after by other officers
As is remembered in titus Lyuyus
Called decembre of diverse cronicles
Among which there was one appius
A judge untrue proud and luxurious
Which through the cite the story berith witness
Behatyd was for his great falsnesse
And onys it fill as he best his look
Upon amaide most ^^ly fair of sight
A falls desire within his heart he took
Her to disuse ageyn all skyll and right
And she was daughter to a worthy knight
Full manly found in his dedis all
And virginius the Romans did him call
Whoos goodly daughter the story does v^lere
Was after him for his noble fame
Virginia called most goodly and entere
And for this cause she bare the same name
But appius to greatly was to blame
Which has conspired through his great falsnesse
If that he might her beutye to oppress
This judge untrue both in thought and deed
Of law unrightful sought out occasion
Made a sargeaunt of his to proceed
Ageyn this maid to take an accion
Cleymyd her his servant by falls collusion
And this done was by appius of intent
That he on her might give a judgment
And by this mean in his false delight
Thought he might her beutye best disuse
So to accomplisshe his flesshly appetite
She being feeble the accion to refuse
Wh^rupon her fader began to muse
Fully conceived of Appius the manner
In her defense wrought as ye shall here
When Appius had yeuyn his judgment
Ageyn this maid which before him stood
Her manly fader most knightly of intent
Took her apart as he thought it good
And with a knife shed her heart blood
Dempt it better to sle her in clennesse
Than the tyrant her beute should oppress
Thus hole conseruyd was her virginite
And vndefoulyd was her maidynhede
For virginius to keep her honestye
Spared no thing to make her sides blede
But Appius for this horrible deed
And Decemuyr through his unhappy chance
Had in that cite never after governance
As the story also makes mention
Appius ashamyd of this deed
Slough him silf fetre^ in preson
Of a falls judge lo here the fynall mede
And tho tribuni in rome began succeed
Tweyne right and wrong truly to discern
And romayn laws justly to govern
Men may here se as in a myrroure clear
Estatis chaungyd for their great offenses
And by su^me pore persons singulere
Princis put down from their magnificences
Which not considre in their great excellences
How god ordeyneth his yerde many sundry wise
The pore sum while the pompous to chastise
Heron to show exaumple anon right
Markyd in story for a notable thing
Pansanias of Greece a manly knight
Of Macedonye slough Philip the king
At a table where he was sittynge
Atwene Alisaundre and Olympiades
His wrong to avenge amyddes al pres
Eke Salmator a knight of low degree
For wrongs done in especial
Of manly force groundyd on equite
Slough of cartage the prince Hastruball
Which brother was unto duke Hanyball
Beside a ryuere as they met in battle
Called metaure which renneth in Itaile
Wherefore ye princes if ye list long endure
Be right well ware be ye never so strong
In your lordshippis not to much assure
Or surquedie the poraile to do wrong
In your discrecion conceyuynge ever among
Gretest dread is that may your state assail
When subieccion does the people fail
Lenuoye
THis tragedy declares in party
What myscheef follows of extorcion
Eke of spousebrech and of auoutre
By Tarquyn done through falls extorcion
Unto lucrece within rome town
Kings exiled for such mysgouernaile
And falls outrages done to the poraile
Eke appius of wilful tirannye
Ageyn virginya took an accion
Through a falls lust of froward lechery
Blent and ferderkyd his memory and reason
Which was cheef cause and occasion
Why the estate of disho^me did fail
Through falls outrage done to the porayle
King philip lost cepture and regalie
Of macedonye the famous region
Vnwa^ly slain amyd his chyualrye
Sittynge at the table within his chheef dongeon
And grettest cause of his falling down
Was when fortune his pride did assail
For falls outrages done to the poraile
^u^e has^^uball whom bokys magnify
Up to the heuyn for his high renoun
^hoos triumphs raught up to the sky
And had all cartage in his subieccion
Yet was he slain vnwaily by treson
By a servant so what it does avail
Treson purposyd before in the poraile
^oble princes your reason do apply
Which over the people have dominaco^n
So prudently to govern them and guye
^^at love and dread by true affeccion
P^^se^ue their hertis from falls rebellyon
^^th to your highness no thing may more prevail
Than true subieccion expert in poraile
^owe Jeroboam king of Israel for Idolatry ^^sobedience came to a myscheuous
end
^Eyt these stories in bochas as I find
There did appear unto his presence
Kings six him praynge to have mind
Upon their fall by unware violence
From their estatys of royal excellence
And tofore all I find that there came
Of all israel king Jeroboam
Unto mine auctoure he began to declare
His dedely compleynt with a pale face
His great myscheuys and his evil fare
And how he fill down from his kingly place
Through great vnhappis which did his hight enbrace
And as this story plainly has devised
For his offenses how he was chastisyd
An Idolatry he was as it was told
Reisyd up auteers of very force and might
Set thereupon two calueryn of pure gold
Did them worship ageyn all skyll and right
Gave evil exaumple in the people sight
When he did with fumys and ensence
To falls ydoles undue reverence
Fro the temple he made the people gone
Priests ordained after his own guise
Forsook the tribe of leuy and aaron
And upon Bethell his offringe began devise
And while he did unlawful sacrifise
God that well knew of him the false intent
From Jerusalem a prophet to him he sent
Which him rebuked of his mysgouernaunce
And began the peryles to him specify
Told him before for to do vengeance
Of david king there should come one Iosie
Which should his priests that falsely could lie
Manly destroy and sle them all at onys
And into ashes brenne them flesh and bonys
And in token of their distruccion
The prophet told among them all
How his auters should bowedoun
And his ydoles from their stage fall
When that folys their goddys falsely call
Which have no power to help in no manner
For they may neither see / feel / nor here
After this prophet Iadan had told
These s^ide signs plainly to the king
His auter fill on pecis many fold
And ouerturnyd bacwarde his offringe
For which the king furiously lokynge
Put forth his hand the story makes mind
Bad his men the prophet take and bind
And as he his arm raught out on length
Had no power it to withdraw ageyn
Wex unwieldy / contracte / and lost his strength
And when the king these tokyns has seyn
And how the prophet spoke no word in veyn
Greatly astonyed could sey no more
But praide Iadan his arm to restore
And by his praiere and mediacion
Of his arm after this vengeance
There was anon made testetucion
And of his pain feleth alegaunce
For which the king with full great instaunce
Requeryd him to be so gracious
That day to abide and dyne in his house
But the prophet would not assent
Nouther with him to ete nor to drink
Took his ass and forth anon he went
On whoos depertynge the king began sore think
And fantasies began in his heart synke
Specially when he took head
Of all his tokens how they were true in deed
God bad Iadan in this great emprise
To Jeroboam first when he was sent
Ete nor drink in no manner wise
In that cite while he was present
But a another prophet of intent
Full old and sligh on that other side
Compellyd has this Iodan to abide
Him aforsinge by falls collusion
To resorto ageyn unto the cite
And to make no contradiccion
With him to dyne of fraternite
To him affermynge it may none other be
For god sent him as to his friend and brother
To abide with him and pleynly with none other
Of frendlihede and true affeccion
Within his house to show his presence
For a repast and a refeccion
This goddis will and fully his sentence
To whoos words the prophet yaue credence
And as they sat at dinner both in fere
God unto Iadan seyde in this manner
For the brekinge of my commandment
Thy great offense and thy transgression
That thou have be so wilful negligent
Thou shall endure this punicion
Be all to torn and rent of a lion
And in thy cuntre thou shall not recure
With prophetis to have thy sepulture
Of which thing this Iadan no thing feign
Began to deperte with full heavy thought
Of a lion amyd of the weye slain
But his ass harmyd was rightnought
A full great merueile if it be well sought
The lion sittynge as in their diffence
And kept them both from all violence
All these tokens might not convert
Jeroboam fro his iniquite
Goddis warning him list not to aduerte
Nor by his prophet correctyd for to be
Wherefore god would that he should se
Vengeance follow as it ded in deed
Both upon him and his kinrede
A son he had which fill in great sickness
Called abimen the book does specify
For which the king bad the queen her dress
To go disgysed without cumpany
Unto a prophet which called was achie
Him to requere truly for to seye
Whether the child should live or dye
And in his inward sight contemplatif
God showed him by clear inspeccion
Of Jeroboam how she was the wife
For all her sleyghty transformacion
For nouther fallas nor falls decepcion
May be god but it be parceyued
For he / ne his prophetys may not be decyued
She came to him in strange wede
At the entering he called her by her name
Come forth quod he for it is no need
To hide thisilf as it were for shame
For the troth truly to attain
God has yeuyn me fully knowlegynge
What thou shall answer and sey to the king
Sey pleynly to him and mark it in thy thought
In thy repair these words rehersynge
Since god has made the and raised up of naught
From a servant to regne as a king
Fro Dauidis kyn most worthy regnynge
Partyd the kingdom and yeuyn it unto the
And thou unkind thereof can no thing se
His great goodness is out of remembrance
Fully forgetyn of thy froward pride
In falls goddys put thin affiaunce
God above falsely set aside
Wherefore from the anon he shall divide
Thy kingdom hole without more delay
And fro thy line the crown take away
And for thou have thy confusion
Thy feith vnfeithfull to falls goddis take
Wrongly refusyd thy religion
Of god above and pleynly him forsake
This is the end which that thou shall make
The and thy kyn no man may socoure
Flessh / skyn / and bone hounds shall devour
And at the entering home to the cite
Thy son and his thou shall find him deed
Of all his kyn though there were none but he
Found very good take thereof good head
Of which answer the queen fill in great dread
Entering the cite in especial
Her child was deed and lay cold by the wall
Of this warning the king took none head
But made him ready with full great aparaile
Forty thousand with him he did led
Of manly men armyd in plate and maile
With king abias for to have a great bataile
The which abias that was of judah king
Unto his people said at their metynge
O noble knights have one thing in momerie
No man venquessheth platly to conclude
With great people nor getith victory
With noumbres hepyd nor great multitude
Falls Idolatres god will them delude
Not suffer his servants that been true and sad
Of miscreauntis to be ouerlad
Triumph is none found of new or old
In these ydolys of stone nor silver shene
Nor in calueryn of metal made or gold
^^ue to that party which untruly mean
And since that god knows our quarrel clean
There is none hope / force none nor might
With them ground them a cause ageyns right
Hope of victory standith upon rightwisnesse
Of them that cast their sinful life to amend
And list forsake wrong and al falsnesse
And with hole heart unto the lord entend
Which shall this day his grace to you send
Our true cause truly to termyne
And thus Abias began his tale fine
His preestys began their trumpes for to blow
And king Abias through his high renoun
Gave to his people both to high and low
For manly confort and consolacion
And fifty thousand by computacion
Were slain that day which full proudly came
Upon the party of king Jeroboam
And all the party of Jeroboam
And all that were of his line borne
After this bataile unto mischeef came
When they were slain with hounds all to torn
As the prophet had them told beforne
But for the king took thereof none head
With soden vengeance god quit him his mede
How zereas king of Ethiope was slain in bataile
AFter him to Bochas did appear
Next in order pleynly as I find
One zareas with a sorrowful chere
And he was king of Ethiope and ynde
Whoos yien were almost with weeping blind
Praynge mine auctour his unhappy chance
With other woeful to put in remembrance
And that he would record by scripture
His sodeyn fall and dolorous distress
And his diffamous hateful disconfiture
With the dispoilynge of his great richesse
And how king asaph through his high noblesse
And his people as he did them assail
Has him venquesshyd and slain in bataile
How Adab king of Jerusalem lost ceptre and crown
OF Israel than came the woeful king
Called Adab full pitously weeping
Unto bachas his compleynt rehersinge
How king basa by subtle falls werkynge
With slaughter caused his falling
When fortune began falsely frown
And took unjustly from him ceptre and crown
How the vengeable prince zambrias set a toure on fire and brent him silf
NExt came zambrias a prince vengeable
Which slough king helam by falls treason
That was found also full unstable
For this zambrias of entencion
Has murdryd him within the cheef dongeon
Of his castle with a full great route
As he unwarily laid a siege about
But a maryn a prince of full great might
Came into Tharse a famous great cite
And cast him plenly like a worthy knight
On this zambrias auengyd for to be
Him to destroy without mercy or pite
But in a toure as zambrias went
Set it a fire and so him self brent
Of king Achab and Iezabell his wife
wIth sighs sore and weeping importable
Came king Achab unto John bochas
Whose hertely sorrow was incomperable
And compleynynge full often seide alas
Besechinge him to write his woeful cas
Compile his fallinge and the fate yfere
Of Athalia his own daughter dear
To god above most contrarious
This Achab was in all his governance
And had a wife cruel and lecherous
Called Iesabell which set al her plesaunce
On gods prophetys for to do vengeance
In the bible their malice men may see
And ydolatres they were both he and she
God for their trespacis as it was well seyn
Aforeshewyd by true prophecy
Sent three year neither dew ne reyn
Upon the earth their grain to multiply
Till eft ageyn by prayere of Helye
Holsom waters from heaven began descend
Which gave them cause their cursyd life to amend
But his wife that cursid Iesabell
To each thing ha^full which was divine
An hundryd prophetis she slough in Israel
Unto baal for they would not inclyne
And she also slough Naboth for his vine
Through whoos outrage and falls oppression
Achab was brought to his confusion
Of his enmyes outraied in bataile
With a sharp arowe caught his fatal wound
Till all his blood by bledynge did fail
About his chare with many dropys round
That the words were full true found
Of helias which told him as it stood
That hungry hounds should lick his blood
In a cite than called Israel
Down from a toure Joined to a wall
The seyde queen called Iesabell
Was ouercast and had a dedely fall
Touching these myscheuys for she was cause of all
Beware ye princes remembering all your lives
To eschew falls counseile yeuyn by your wives
Of queen Gatholia for her tirannie slain
nExt to Achab in order did sue
Gatholia with doolfull countenance
Both besechinge as him though due
Her sodeyn fall to put in remembrance
Sours and cheef rote of sorrow and mischaunce
Usurpation and of falls couetise
Like as her story herafter shall deuyse
She was vpreised by favor in three things
For fader / brother / and also her husbonde
Were in that time echone crowned kings
With ceptre and sword as ye shall understand
Many emprises their days took on hand
And how fortune their highness did assail
I cast shortly to make rehersaile
She fill of fortune in the unhappy boundys
First when her fader was with an arowe deed
His blood vplickyd with cruel hungry hounds
About his chaar rennynge down full read
His body pale lay who that took head
Like a careyn nakyd and dispoiled
With foul black earth amyd the feeld ^soiled
Cause of another unhappy heaviness
And of her dedly desolacion
Was the people felly did them dress
Of Arabie in their rebellyon
Ageyn her husbonde of entencion
To rob his tresoure to their auantage
And his richesse by outrageous pillage
Su^me of his meyne they put in prison
There was ageyn them made no diffence
Spared nouther cite brough nor town
Slough man and child thorugh s^urdy violence
Her lord enfect with sodeyn pestilence
Conceived fully by his maladye
There was no geyn but he must dye
After his death most wretchyd and odible
His body corrupt his bowellys fill down
Of his cateyn the stench was so horrible
There enf^^t about him inuyron
With so great horroure and putrefaccion
That no man might abide nor endure
To bring his body unto sepulture
Her third unhap whereof she was full fayn
That fortune li^t her eft assail
Made her uncle king Ioram to be slain
With an arowe as he fled in bataile
She supposinge greatly it should avail
Like a woman most furious and wode
She of king david slough all the royal blood
(...) purpose was to govern all the realm
Alone hirsilf to have dominacion
To regne in Judah and Jerusalem
This Gatholia by usurpation
And for that cause in her entencion
With mortal sword she made tho fine
That were descendyd from david down by line
Eycept one Ioas there left none a live
Child of a year son of king Ochosie
Whom Iosaketh the story does discryue
Of very pity caught a fantasy
The child to save that he shall not dye
From the malice of Gatholia
And she was wife to bishop Ioiada
She and this bishop with hole heart and entere
Kept this child in full sec^e wise
Within the temple the space of seven year
And in the seventh the story does devise
Ioiada took on her this emprise
Young Ioas within a certain day
By just title to crown him if she may
His messangers he sendith out anon
Of princis tribunys began a counseyl call
Of prestys eke and leuytes euerichon
And when he had discuryd to them all
Hole his intent thus it is befall
Sworn and assentyd as it was sittinge
That young Ioas shall be crowned king
For by promise which that is divine
Quod Ioiada if ye take heed
God has behestyd to david and his line
And assured unto his kinrede
In jerusalem how they shall succeed
And though Ioas be young and tender of might
He to the crown has never less right
In this matter I will not that ye sleep
But to show your true diligence
On four pertyes the temple for to keep
That no man enter by no violence
And in the mids by royal excellence
Quod this busshop no man shall us let
On Ioas head a crown for to set
And when each thing was brought to the point
His high estate to encrece and magnify
The people anon when he was anoint
Viuat rex they began to cry
And when Gatholia began this thing epsy
For very Ire and the sodeyn wonder
Of malencolye her clothes cut asondre
Ran to the temple and began make afray
With her meyne and to cry aloude
Bad them go sle and make no delay
The young king in all the have they could
Her venym hid under a covert cloud
All atonys her purpos to recure
By sodeyn malice she began that day discure
The temple kept enter had she none
People ordained awaytinge for the nonys
And or she might any forther gone
Clenly armyd the Centurionys
The cruel queen assailyd all atonys
And of her malice to write a short tale
They slough her after of Cedron in the vale
Lo here the end of murdre and tyranny
Lo here the end of usurpation
Lo here the end of falls conspiracye
Lo here the end of falls presumpcion
Borne rightful heirs wrongly to put them down
O noble princes though god has made you strong
To rightful heirs be ware ye do no wrong
Lenuoye
THese tragedies / to estatis and degrees
Fully declares the decepcions
Of fortunes falls mutabilitees
Showed in provinces Cites and eke tou^s
Princes unwarily lost their possessiou^s
Which from their sins in no manner wise
Had of god warning and list not for to rise
Mighty princes cast down from their sees
Lost their lives and their regions
Unwarily throw from their felicitees
Jeroboam for his oppressions
And for his froward falls oblacions
Done to ydoles his story does deuyse
Had of god warning and list not for to rise
Achab also had great aduersitees
Through falls counseyle and exortacions
Of Iezabell rote of Iniquitees
Did to his people great extorcions
She slough prophetys goddys champions
Both he and she most cursyd in their guyse
Had of god warning and list not for to rise
Gathalia with her duplicitees
And conspiryd falls intrusions
Slough dauidis sede to enter their dignitees
And to possede their dominacions
But for her hatfull falls collusions
Unwarily slain for her great couetise
Had of god warning and list not for to rise
Princes remember in your prosperitees
And se before in your discrecions
Wrong clymbinge up of statys or degrees
Outher by murdre or by falls tresons
Axeth a fall for their fynall guerdons
Namely of them that the lord despise
And for his warning lift not for to rise
How Di^o queen of cartage slough her silf for conseruacion of her chastity
Now must I put my rude style in prees
To queen dydo make my passage
Her lord Siche was priest to hercules
Her fader Belus fell in great age
King of Tire and she queen of Cartage
And it is red in books that been true
How first in Tire was found purpyl hue
Cadmus found first lettres for to write
Gave them to grekys as made is mention
Whoos brother Fenix as clerks eke endyte
Found first the color of vermylion
And of cartage the famous mighty town
This said Dido her story does express
How she was queen and founderesse
But her husbonde was cheef lord and sire
Called Sicheus full famous of ronoun
Of this noble cite called Tire
Had great tresour and great possession
And for envy king Pigmalion
Brother to dydo this Siche slough in deed
Of falls intent his richesse to possede
Dido this slaughter took grievously to heart
Sore compleynynge this unhappy chance
Cast she would if she might asterte
Fle out of Tire and her silf anaunce
With all the tresoure and the habundaunce
Behind left when her lord was deed
Her shippys entringe went away for dread
She knew and dred the gredy avarice
Of her brother king pigmalion
And how that hateful vnstauncheable vice
Was ground and rote / and cheef occasion
Why that her lord was slain in that town
For whom she cried full often welaway
Whoos death was cause why she fled away
She had also this opinyon
Which caused most her hertly heaviness
That since her brother pygmalyon
Had slain her lord for his great richesse
If she abode that he would him dress
Parcel for malice / parcel for couetise
To have tresoure sum treason to practice
And for to eschew his malice and treason
For her navy she makes ordenaunce
By the auice of them in whom as by reason
She should of right set her aff^aunce
And they full ready her to do plesaunce
By one assent for no thing would fail
With fair dydo out of that land to sail
In Cipres first was her arryuaile
And there she fond by the river side
Of young maidens with full rich apparaile
Sixty and ten in the same tide
Which in the temple of venus did abide
After the custom as I can report
Of Cipriens strangers to disporte
And in their most feithfull humble wise
After the rightys of Cipre the cuntre
Unto venus each day do sacrifise
Them to conserve in their virginite
Duringe their life to live in chastity
Never to be joined in marriage
And with queen dido they went to cartage
In their passage fill a great miracle
As seruius meketh mention
For Dido took of Juno this oracle
Outher by apparynge or by aduision
Of cartage to bylde that mighty town
And at reverence of that great gods
She to the pertyes fast began her dress
The said cite st^tly for to found
And her werkmen as they the earth sought
An oxys head of adventure they found
And to queen dydo anon the head they brought
Menynge whereof to search out they thought
And her clerkys in their deuynayle
Told it was tokyn of seruage and travail
For which she list to bylde that place
And remeue as she ought of right
And fro thens but a litell space
A soil she fond full dilectable of sight
And as her werkmen with their full might
The ground began search / anon or they took head
The story tellyth they fond an horse head
And by expownynge of her deuynours
Fond this best might greatly avail
Unto princes and mighty conquerous
Necessary in werre and bataile
And for no wight her noblesse should assail
Cartage she byldyd of so great excelleence
Ageyn all enmyes to stand at diffence
Su^me books declare and specify
Dydo did as much land purchase
As a skyn in round might ocupye
Of an ox thereon to bylde a place
The ground compacyd took a large space
Which strongly bildyd thus it is befall
After the skyn men birsa did it call
And when this cite mightily was wallyd
After a skyn wrought by good curray
The name take / Ca^ it was called
Lethyr of birsa pleynly this is no nay
Took eke his name duringe many a day
Carta and birsa knyt in their langage
As much to say as this word cartage
And in Affrik stant the teritorie
Where she bylded this cite dilectable
Founded it in laud and memory
Of mighty Juno the goddys honorable
The cite wallyd with toures strong and stable
Time of king david amyd the fourth age
As I said erst called it cartage
With great worship she regnyd in that town
Ever of purpos to live in chastity
And round about floured her renoun
Of her prudence and her honestye
Till the report of her famous beutye
Came to the ^erys which gladly will not hide
Of a king that dwelled there beside
Of Musitans he was lord and sire
As poetis pleynly list descryue
Which in his heart greatly began desire
The queen dido by her assent to wyue
Unto her grace if he might aryue
But for she had auowed chastity
She never cast married to be
The king supprisyd with love in his courage
For her wisdam and her great bou^te
Sent for the princis of cartage
On this matter to have a great trete
To condescende if it might be
Like his desire in all their best intent
Do their deuer to make her consent
With his request he began them eke monace
If he failyd of his entencion
Like his desire to stand in his grace
Seide he would be enmy to their town
To ordeyne by force for their distruccion
Not fully sobre / nor fully in a rage
This was to them plainly his langage
But for they knew her great steadfastness
And her heart very inmutable
They were aferde any word to express
Lest their answer were not acceptable
To his highness for he was not tretable
Eke in their concent they began also record
To his desire the queen would not acorde
With good auyce an answer they puruey
To his purpos in party favorable
Aferde he would their noble town werreie
Or of disdeyne upon them be vengeable
But queen Dido in her intent ay stable
Cast she would what so ever they her told
Her chaste auowe feithfully to hold
She set aside of this cruel king
His fell manacis and his words great
And to her princes for their consenting
Which stood in feer of that he did them threte
She unto them yaue a manner hete
For they were bold to attempt or to attame
To trete of matter reboundynge to her shame
Nay rather dye quod she than assent
To his desires which ^kynge god forbede
Or fro the tentre of my chaste intent
For to remeue outher in thought or deed
Which disclaundre to all womanhede
To condescende for any manacynge
To break my vow for plesaunce of a king
Touching manaris made to this cite
For to destroy it with his great might
Without cause or title of equite
To ground him a quarrel ageyn right
Only for he is blinded of his sight
With froward lust my chaste auowe to assail
Be right well sure how he thereof shall fail
If ye were bold and manly of courage
For common profit your cite to diffende
And withstonde his vicious outrage
To trete with him ye woldnat condescende
But mine intent platly to comprehend
Whether it be to you joy or displesaunce
In my promys shall be no variaunce
My lord Sicheus which alas is deed
Unto the world who list aduerte
Trust verrely for manacynge nor dread
That he shall dye in mine heart
Nor he shall never mine auowe pervert
Thus auisyd while that I stand fre
Queen of cartage to govern this cite
Mine hasty answer I pray you disdeyne
But that ye list to give me liberte
With your support that I may attain
To have a space grauntyd unto me
This to mean the space of monethis three
My lords will to accomplissh of intent
Which whilom made in his testament
Under color to her auantage
She took this space books specify
That she might her cite of cartage
The mean time strongly fortefie
Ageyn her enemies that for no slogardye
Of them that would her high estate confound
Unpurveyed her cite not be found
When three monethys passyd were and gone
She after would for hertely plesaunce
With sundry rightes many mo than one
To all her goddys do sum obseruaunce
For a special singular remembrance
Of him that was as folk shall vnders^^nde
Whilom her lord and best beloved husbonde
And more to exalte her glory and his honor
Held his exequies by due reverence
Of all cartage in the highest toure
With brennynge fire fumys and encence
Her princis all being in presence
To which she began declare in compleynynge
Her dedly sorrow down from her ^oure lokynge
Farewell my friends farewell for evermore
Unto my lord my husbonde I must gone
To him I mean that was my lord of yore
For of husbondes god wot I have but one
Praynge you to report euerychon
After my death dydo of cartage
Joined was but ones in marriage
Sey to the king which you manacyd
My chaste beutye that he would assail
Go tell him how that I am pacyd
And of his purpos how that he shall fail
His manasinge shall not him avail
And say how dydo dyed for the nonys
For she not would be weddyd more than onys
Lever I have my life now to lose
Rather than soil my wedowes chastity
Late him go ferther sum other to chose
For in such case he shall not speed of me
And with the tresoure of mine honestye
Which I have truly obseruyd all my live
I will depart out of this world now bly^e
And into fire that brent clear and bright
She ran in have there is no more to seyne
Save with a knif in every mannys sight
Full suddenly she roof her heart on tweyne
Whoos pitous death the cite began complain
Sore weeping for wonder and for ruthe
In a woman to find so great a truth
After her death they did their besinesse
To hold and halowe a feast funeral
Worshipped her like a chaste gods
And her commendyd in especial
To heavenly goddys / and gods infernal
And wedowes all in their clothes blake
And this fest wept for her sake
Touching Dido late there be no strif
Though that she be accusyd of Ouide
After bochas I wrote her chaste lif
And the contrary I have set aside
For me thought it was better to abide
On her goodness than thing reherce in deed
Which might resowne ageyn her womanhede
To Eneas though she were favorable
To Itaile making his passage
All that she did was comendable
Him to receive coming by Cartage
Though su^me folk were large of their langage
Amys to expowne by report or to express
Thing done to him only of gentilnesse
There shall for me be made no rehersaile
But as I find wretyn in bochas
For to say well may much more avail
Than froward spech in many diverse case
But all Cartage often said alas
Her death compleynynge throughout their cite
Which slough her silf to observe her chastity
Lenuoye

In one a^o^^ may ^e no ^e^irnesse
To your heart be diverse of langage
Contrary to Dido that was queen of cartage
Hold your seruauntis under obeisaunce
Late them nouther have fredam nor largess
But under danger do their obseruaunce
Daunte their pride them bridelynge with lowness
And when the serpent of newfangylnesse
Assaileth you do your advantage
Contrary to Dido that was queen of Cartage
How vicious Sardanapalle king of assirie brent him self and his tresoure
oF Assirie to rekyn kings all
Which had that land under subjection
Last of all was Sardanapalle
Most femynyne of condition
Wherefore fortune has him throw down
And compleynynge most ougly of manner
Next after dydo to bochas did appear
To vicious lust his life he did enclyne
Among assiriens when he his regne began*
Of falls usage he was so femynyne
That among wymen upon the rock he span
In their habit disguysed from a man
And of froward flesshly insolence
Of all men he fled the presence
First this king chase to be his guide
Mother of vices called Idelnesse
Which of custum each virtue set aside
In each acourt where she is maistres
Of sorrow and myscheef the first founderesse
Which caused only this sardanapall
That to all goodness his wits did appall
He fond up first riete and dri^^^enesse
Called a fader of lust and lecherye
Hateful of heart he was to sobirnesse
Cherisshinge surfetis watch and glotenye
Called in his time a prince of baudrie*
Fond rere^opers and fethirbeddys soft
Drink late and change his wynes often
The air of metys and of baudy cokys
Which of custum all day roost and sede
Savor of spetys ladlys and flessh ho^ys
He loved well and took of them great head
And folk that drank more than it was need
Smelling of wine for their great excess
With them to abide was holy his gladness
H^ ^ought also it did him good
To hau^ ^boute him with skyll and right
Boistous bo^hers all bespreynt with blood
And wa^ry fisshers abode ever in his sight
Their cotys poudryd with sca^is silver bright
Dempte their odor duringe all his life
Was to his ^orage best preseruatife
For there was no herb spice gras ne ro^e
To him so lusty as was the borde^house
Nor gardeyn none so holsom nor so sote
To his plesaunce nor so delicious
As the presence of folks lecherous
And ever glad to speak of rebaudye
And folk cherisshe that could flatere and lie
Till at the last god of very right
Displesed was with his conditions
Because he was in every mannys sight
So femynyne in his affe^^ions
And holy yaue his inclynacions
Duringe his life to every vious thing
Terrible to here and namely of a king
But as bochas list to put in mind
When Arbachus a prince of great renown
Saw of this king the flesshly lustys blind
Made with the people of that r^gion
Ageyns him a comuracion
And to him sent for his mysgouernaunce
Of high disdeyne a full pleyn diffiaunce
Bad him beware and proudly to him told
That he him cast his vicious life to assail
And in all have also that he would
Within a feelde mete him in bataile
Whereof astonyed his heart began to fail
Where among wymen he sat making gau^i^
No wight about but flateres and baudys
And up he rose and began him silf to auaunce
No s^uf about him but sergeauntes riatous
Took the field without governance
No men of armies but folks vicious
Whoos adversary called arbachus
Made him proudly the field to forsake
That like a cowarde his castle he has take
And for his heart frowardly began fail
Not like a knight but like a losengoure
His rich perre his royal apparaile
His gold his Jewels vessels and tresoure
Was brought before him down of a toure
Amyd of his palite and yaue his men in charge
Of cole and faggot to make afire full large
In which he keft his tresoure and Jewels
More bestiall than like a manly man
And amyd his rich stones and vessels
Into the fire furously he ran
This triumph Sardanapallus wan
Which fire consumed for his final mede
Brent all to ashes among the coals read
Tofore his death bad men should write
Upon his grave the book do specify
With letters large this reason for to endyte
My cursyd life my froward glotenye
Mine Idelnesse mine hateful lecherye
Has ausyd me with many falls desire
My las^ days to be consumpt with fire
This Epitaffe on his grave he set
To show how he was in all his live
Besy ever to hindre and to let
All manner virtue and there ageyn to strive
Who follows his tra^e is never like to thryu^
For which ye princes se for your avail
Vengeance ay f^loweth vices at the tail
A commendacion of ^^chas of ve^ (...) ^^^ynes rehersynge names fou^dyrs of

THere eke other that list falsely provide

Them silf delitynge for to bestyall
Tweyne manner folks to put in reme^^raunce
Of vice and virtue to put in a difference
The good alweye has sit their plesaunce
In virtuous labor to do their diligence
And vicious people in sloth and negligence
And the report of both is reseruyd
With laud or lack as they have deseruyd
Men must of right the virtuous prefer
And truly preyse labor and business
And ageynwarde dispreysen folk that err
Which have no Joy but in Idelnesse
And to compare by manner of witness
Virtuous folk I will to mind call
In rebukynge of king Sardanapall
THe old wise called Pictagoras
By sou^de of hameris auctours certyfie
Example took and cheef master was
That fond out musyke and melodye
Yet of Tubal some books specify
That he by struck of smethis where they stood
Foude first out musyke tofore noes flode
And Josephus remembers by scripture
That this Tubal could forge well
First ymagyned making of armure
With Instruments of Iron and of steel
And their temprures he fond out euerydell
Lucyus Tarquyn in story as I find
Fond cheynes first folk to fettre and bind
The children of Seth in story ye may see
Flourynge in virtue by long successyons
For to profit to their posterite
And first the craft of heavenly mocions
Fond of sundry steries the reuolucions
Bequeth their cu^nynge of great advantage
To them that after came of their lynage
For their virtue god gave them great cu^nynge
Touching natures both of earth and of heuyn
And it remembered sothely by writing
To lastyn ay for water or for leuene
Generacions there were of them seuene
Which for virtue without werre or strif
Trauayled in cu^nynge during al their lif
And for that adam did prophecy
Twyes the world destroyed should be
With water and onys stond in Iupartye
Next with fire which no man might flee
But Sethis children all this did see
Made two pyl^^s where men might grave
From fire and water the ca^^ctes for to save
That one was made of tyles hard I bake
Fro touch of fire to save the scripture
Of hard marbyll they did another make
Again water strongly to endure
To save of letters the prente and the figure
For their cu^nynge before began so provide
Again fire and water perpetually to abide
They dempte their cu^nynge had been in veyn
But folk with them had been portable
And for their labor should afterward be seyn
They it remembrid by writing full notable
Unto fore god a thing full comendable
To them that follow by scripture and writing
Or that men dye depart their cu^nynge
For by old time folk diverse craftys found
In sundry wise for occupacion
Virtue to cherisshe vices to confound
Their wit they set and their entencion
To put their labor in execucion
And to outrage this is verrey troth
For mannys life negligence and sloth
Old Ennok full famous of virtue
During that age fond first of euerychon
Through his prudence lettres of hebrew
And in a pilere they were kept of stone
Till that the flode of Noe was gone
And after him Ca^n was the second
By whom of hebrew lettres were first found
And Catacrismus the first was that fond
Letters also as of that langage
But letters wretyn with gods own hand
Moses first took most bright of his visage
Upon Syna as he held his passage
Which of carectis and names in sentence
From other writing had a difference
Eke afterward as other books tell
And saint Ierom rehercith in his style

And Abraham began since a great while

Isys in egypt fond diversity
Of sundry lettres partyd into tweyne

NOble princes here ye may well se
As in a myrrour of full clear evidence
By many exaumples more than ^^ or three
^^at harm follows of sloth and negligence
Deep enprentynge in your aduertence
How great hindringe does wilful frowardness
To your estate through unto us Idelnesse
When reason falls and censualite

And soberness has lost his liberte
And to false lust is done the reverence
And vice of virtue has an appearance
Misledeth princes of wilful rechelesnesse

How amazias i^ Judah king for pride and presu^pcion was venquesshed in
battle and after slain
IN his study as bochas sat musing
With many uncouth soleyne fantasye
To him apperyd many mighty ^inge
And tofore all came worthy amazie
His son also that called was Iosie
Of dauidis blood descendynge as I read
Each after other in Judah to succeed
First amazias compleyned in fortune
Causinge his grievous great aduersitees
The traitouresse called in comune
These kings tweyne castinge from their sees
Who^^ ouerturnynge from their dygnitees
Unware fallinge dreadful and terrible
Been ceriously remembered in the bible
Their end men may there read and see
How fortune their fates did entrete
Wherefore teschewe and fle prolixite
Of tedious thing in this process to let
And in substance to glene out the great
Of their falling I purpose not to spare
Compendiously the causes to declare
This amazias having governance
By just title of succession
The ceptre of judah with all the hole puissaunce
Fu^l p^sibly in his possession
Till that pride and falls presumpcion
Most frowardly did his heart ^nbrace
Which all atonys made him lose his grace
In heart he had amaner veyneglorye
Because that god made him to prevail
In his ^onquest and to have victory
A^ (...) to venquyssh in bateyle
Eke (...) ^anytis as he them did assail
Purposinge after if he might
With Israelitis of pride for to fight
Unto king Ioas of israel he sent
Him co^maundynge to obey his hyddinge
And be like subget as were in their intent
His predecessors in all manner thing
Whilom to david the noble worthy king
This was his sonde to Ioas plat and pleyne
Which by a problem thus wrote to him again
THe ougly thistle of the vales low
Proudly presumynge above his degree
To make his pride openly be know
Sent his message to the Cedre tree
That his son might wedded be
To his daughter all though in substance
Atwene them two was a great discordaunce
But of the forest the bestes sauagyne
In their corages had thereof disdeyne
All of assent fersly did enclyne
The this^le leuys abroad upon the pleyne
That there was nouther leef nor prik seyne
This was the problem which Ioas by wrytinge
Sent in a pistle to amazie the king
But Josephus in his orygynall
The said epis^le as he does express
Seith (...) the vale how the powder small
Of pride sent to the high Cypress
That his daughter of excellent fayrenesse
Unto his son pleynly to deseryue
Might be delivered and hau^ her to wyue
But a fell be which beside stood
Of cruel Ire and Indignacion
With fete disdeynynge the powder cast abroad
High in the air about him enuyron
The which ensample conceived of reason
Who that attempteth to clymbe high a loft
With unware change his fall is full vnsoft
A twene the cedre of trees of royal
And a sharp thisile is no conuenience
Nor twene a cipresse estatly found attall
And lothsum powder is a great difference
For royal blood should have no assistence
So be joined nor knyt in marriage
With such as been brought forth of low p^g^
The cedre is strong^ and mighty of substa^nce
In his vpgrowynge right as any line
And though the thistle have spots of plesaunce
He has eke pricks sharp as any spyne
And both natures plainly to termyne
The cedre of kind who look well about
To no though thistle should his branches lou^e
Halsom of odor is the fair cipresse
As books tell and virtuous of kind
Dust and powder plainly to express
Troubles the air and makith folks blind
For which in spousayle conuenience to find
Late estates of their birth honorable
Void all rascalye and wedde their semblable
(...) amazias would not be ware
For no warning nor for no prophecy
But still in heart great hatred bare
Again king Ioas of malice and envy
Into a feelde brought all his chiualrye
Gadred them out both nere and far
Against gods will on him to gynne a werre
And king Ioas full like a worthy knight
Into the feelde fast began him speed
And all the knights of judah anon right
With smet of vengeance with a sodeyne dread
To bid them fle god w^t it was no need
And amazias for all his great pride
Stood destitute and no man by his side
With him was none left of al his meyne
So god and Ioas against him wrought
Of Jerusalem entered the cite
And amazie of force with him he brought
And in the temple the tresoure out he sought
Gold and silver and holy their richesse
And to Samarie home he began him dress
And amazias he let out of prison
After all this and suffryd him goo fre
To his myscheef and his confusion
And he was delivered from his captyuyte
For slain he was in Lachi^ the cite
Among his friends by symulacion
His death conspired under full falls treason
How upon Josias succedynge king next in Judah took vengeance smote him with
lepre
aFter in Judah the mighty region
Next Amazias Josias began succeed
Wonder manly and famous of renoun
In all his works full provident in deed
And of his knight hode venquesshed as I read
The pales^ynes for all their great puissaunce
With all ambye he brought unto vtiraunce
Bylded touns and many a strong cite
And unto Egypt he his bounds set
Made castles beside the read see
And in his conquest whom that ever he met
Of manly pride he would let
I mine al tho that were his aduarsaries
To his lordship to make them tributaries
He did his labor also to repare
Jerusalem after his ruin
The walls rered which on the soil lay bare
Made new toures right as any line
Fanys of gold their torrettes to enlumyne
And toffor^e them let werkmen undertake
Square bastilis and bolewerkys to make
He delyted to make fressh gardeynes
Diverse greyne and herbs for to know
Reioysed to plant sundry vynes
To graffe trees and seeds for to sow
And strange fruits make them grow arowe
And with him had his enemies to encombre
Three hundred thoused manly men in noumbre
His noble fame began to sprede wide
And greatly ded for his prowes
Wherethrugh his heart corrupt with pride
Because only of his great riches
And frowardly he did his ^esynes
For to malign in estate royal
Again the lord which is immortal
To god above he began wexe obstinate
Tha^ (...) process full small he did win
(...) ^oure caught in his royal estate
To ^^^owe his fader in unthrift and sin
That grace and virtue from him did twynne
In most shyninge of his magnificence
Fortune proudly assailed his excellence
Cast she would within a little while
His surquedye and froward pride assail
And full unwarily deceive him and begile
To make his power to appall and to fail
Wh^ (...) king took on thapparaile
Of a (...) of very frowardness
And into temple proudly began him dress
Being in purpos on a solemn day
To take his way up to the hye aultere
Falsely usurping who so ever said nay
To sacrifie holding the cens^re
Tofore the altar that shone of gold full clear
For which offense the bible says the same
Azarias the busshop did him blame
Began withstonde him in the face anon
Fourscore prestes being in presence
Of the kynred descended of Aaron
Which forbad him and made resistance
That with his hand he should put incence
Upon the altar again gods law
Him chargynge boldly his presence to withdraw
But of despyte he made them hold their p^es
In pain of death began them to manace
And suddenly among all the prees
An erthquaue fill in the same place
And therwithall in the kings face
Of the son there smote a beme so bright
That all his face was skorkyd with the light
He wexyd a lepre foul and right terrrible
For his offense as god list ordeyne
To every man of look he was terrible
And but few his mischeef began complain
And a great hill the same hour carf on tweyne
Not far aside from the town without
Cytees distroynge that stood round about
On king Iosie god took his vengeance
For all his lordship and his magnificence
To punisshe his pride and his froward puissaunce
And brought him low for his great offense
For his person was put out of presence
Perpetuelly as holy wryt can tell
Far from all people with lepres for to dwell
His flessh was troubled with diverse passions
For his sickness auoydded the cite
In cry and sorwe and lamentacions
His li^ (...) lad in great aduersite
And so he dyed in sorrow and pouerte
Symply buried for all his great might
Within an Island that stood f^r out of sight
An exortacion to princes to be auised to do ageyn gods precepts.
LEt princes al in their providence
Be right well ware any thing to atame
Which unto god should be offense
List that the fine conclude to their shame
Let them think for all their noble fame
But they repent god of his Iustise
Their froward pride unwarily will chastise
Let them be ware of malice to presume
Again his church to do offencion
For god of righ all tyrauntis will consume
In full short time for their presumpcion
Which will not suffer their domynacion
To enterupt for all their great might
Nor break the fraunchise of holy church right
To prudent princes which can discern
Let king Josias / considred his offense
Been in their mind a myrrour and lantern
To holy church to do due reverence
And conceive in their magnificence
God will of right be they never so strong
Chastise their malice though he abide long
How king Ozie was takyn by king salmanazar and dyed in prison
THere was another that called was Ozie
Which whilom reigned as I afferme dare
In israel whom fortune by envy
Made him betake or he was ware
Beseged about of king Salmanazare
And into assirie under his danger
The bible tells he was a prisoner
His cites towns brought to destruction
And all his people under long seruage
Were take and kept in strong babylon
Suffered there great pain and damage
And in prison by furious outrage
This said Ozias in cheynes bound sore
For sorrow dyed of him write I no more
How senacheryb king of assirie was slain
wIth these forsayde woeful kings three
Senacheryb of assirie king
Came to John bochas most ougly to se
Full pitously his fate compleynynge
And specially his vnwore chaunginge
He began bew^yle oppressed in his thought
From hye noblesse how he was brought to naught
His reason sprad through many diverse R^me
And all people began him magnify.
A syege he laid unto Jerusalem
In the time of king Sedechie
But in his most froward surquedye
Gods angel tofore the cite
An hundred thousand slough of his meyne
And the more to make him aferde
Amyd of his people the silf some night
Gods angel shoue awey his berde
With a sharp sword that shone fair and bright
Left his syege and took him unto flight
And in a temple his goddys worshippinge
Sloughe him silf as he sat knelinge
How king sedechie for falls forsweringe was slain and made bl^nde in prison
Touching the compleynt of king Sedechie
And of his sorrows to show the manner
Holy wryt do clerly specify
Wherefore it were but vein to tell them here
For there men the process may pleynly lere
How Ioachim king of Jerusalem
His own brother was led out of his Rem
Whereof in heart he felt full great soor
This Sedechias as it is there found
Because the king nabugodonosor
His brother hilde strong in prison bound
Fully in purpos the Jews to confound
For this tiraunt had in that mortal strif
His brethren / children in prison and his wif
And yet this tyrant in his tyranny
This favor did in his fell rage
Unto this most woeful Sedechye
To suffer him regne in his great age
From year to year to pay him a truage
By faith and oath and composicion
Raised of his people and brought to babylon
Yet Sedechias in especial
By a manner of falls felicite
Him silf reioysed in his se royal
To occupye that noble dignyte
And so forgate the great aduersitye
Of his brother and other friends al
Touching the myscheef that they were in fall
Of pride he fill into presumpcion
When he remembered his brethren and his lynage
Considred how fro king Salamon
He was descendyd by title of heritage
Began disdeyne to pay his truage
And to malign in heart he was so wroth
And falsely brake his suraunce and his oath
He had o manner indignacion
Which he caught of old remembrance
How time passed to king Salamon
By his manly prudent governance
Kings about for a recognysaunce
Paid tribute and dursit it not withseye
Fro year to year his noblesse to obey
Which thing remembered of king sedechie
As he wexe great and strong in puissaunce
O^ hye disdeyne his tribute began deny
Set aside his feith and assurance
So that his oath stood in no substance
For he again the king of babylon
Presumptusly fill in rebellion
And his kingdom to strength and fortefie
Thought he would to his advantage
The king of egypt have on his party
Of pride he fill into so great outrage
That he no more would pay his truage
Full finally such ways he has sought
That of his oath litell he rought or naught
But woo alas it is a dolfull thing
To be remembered in hye or low degree
That any prince or any worthy king
Should falls his oath or untrue be
Or that men should such variaunce see
In their corages which been so hye borne
For any cause falsely to be forsworn
By report it does their fame trouble
Infortuneth and clipsith their noblesse
When a prince is of his heeste double
And chargith not of wilful recl^snesse
Alby his promys conclude on doubleness
Though god a while suffer them and respyte
At the unset hour their falsnesse he will quyte
His warning often he sent to them before
Because they lack prudent policy
Record I take of nabugodonosor
Which came unwarily on king sedechye
For he his tribute began falsely him deny
With all his power as did abrayde
To Jerusalem a mighty syege laid
They within constreyned were of need
The king himsilf there was no better deffence
With mannys flessh his people for to feed
While the Caldeis by mighty violence
Of very force without resistance
On falsforsweringe for to take wrake
Their mighty toures and their walls brake
To sle and kill they list none to spare
Who so ever they met or came in their sight
Sedechias left the town all bare
But take he was as he him took to flight
In cheynes bound and fetryd anon right
In whoos presence to encrece his peynes anon
His young children were slain euerychon
His wives most woeful in their cherys
Which in their time most goodly were and fair
Delivered were in hands of straungeris
And more alas to put him in despair
Into his kingdom never to have repayire
With sharp tongues it was to great a pain
Out of his head were rent his ^yen tweyne
Of Jerusalem his cite was brent
Pleyne into the ground into ashes deed
His great riches his tresoure holy sent
To babylon with stones blewe and read
Vessels of gold which richest were in deed
Without mercy or remyssion
Caldeis took to their possession
And thus in sorrow and in wretchidnesse
He dyed alas fetryd in prysen
Loo here the end of perjury and falsnesse
Loo how fortune can turn vpsodoun
Of mortal men the condition
Now richest shynynge in hye prosperity
With unware change to hateful pouertye
Now men lift up to royal dignitees
Now hye aloft by fulsum habundaunce
But what avails to sit in royal sees
To folk that have therein none assurance
Namely when fortune holds the balaunce
Which aye of custom unto high estates
Has a false joy to show her chekmates
Record I take of princes more than one
Their woeful fatys hanging in Iupartye
Remembered late and among echon
The woeful fall of king amazie
His son eke lepre which called was Iosye
And last of all how in Babylon
King Sedechias dyed in prison
Lenuoye.
NOble princes concidre the fallas
Of fortunys froward flatene
Sees her deceytes in many diverse cas
How she first mocked manly amazye
Which slain was for his surquedye
To give you warning by exaumple as ye may read
When ye sit highest your fall is most to dread
And as it remembers in Bochas
Eke in the bible of king Iosye
In his time how famous that he was
Both of riches and of chyualrye
Punysshed with lepre books specify
For his presumynge remembers this in deed
When ye sit highest your fall is most to dread
All worldly glory flees hens a great pas
I take witness of king Sedechie
For f^ls forsweringe he slain was alas
M^de blind in prison the story cannat lie
Thus shows fortune through her froward envy
To you princes if ye list take heed
When ye sit highest your fall is most to dread
How king astryages labored to disherite cirus But god suffered his malice
not to prevail
AFter these kings one followed in the pres
And to bochas his compleynt discure
And he was called the great as^riages
Which told in order his uncouth adventure
Lord of Asye as books us assure
And had of tresure during all his life
Above all kings a prerogatife
Most unfortunate in all his gouernaile
Felt of fortune none aduersite
Save an heir male no thing did him fail
For he most glorious sat in his glorious se
Of wordly wealth he lackyd no plentye
Except only as clerks of him write
He had no son his kingdom to enherite
Which to his wealth was great discres
Lest succession failed in his line
A daughter had he called mundanes
Out of whoos womb as books determyne
He drempte on a night how he saw a vine
In his auision with him so it stood
Over all asie his braunchis spread abroad
He had also a reuelacion
Slepynge a night after his soupeere
Though he not knew the exposicion
He thought he saw a cristallyn ryuere
With lusty waters as any beryll clear
Out of her womb with his stremys fresshe
The soil of asye make tender and nesshe
Touching this river and this lusty vine
To him showed in his auision
Within him silfe he could not termyne
Thereof to find no clear conclusion
Without some manner exposicion
To him declared by folks in sentence
Which of such dremys had experience
To him he called his astronomers
His philophers and his dyuynours
That knew the menynge of the nine speers
Vmages of sterres their houses and their toures
And such as were expert expositours
And they were assembled euerichon
Touching his dreme they cordyd all in one
To tell him troth they were not recles
Said his daughter fro whom there came a vine
She that by name was called mundanes
Should have descendynge from his line
Whoos noble fame through asye should shine
Which should put through his renown
Him by force of his armies out of his region
This was his fate he might it not refuse
The heavenly course but it did fail
Whereupon he sore began to muse
Such fantasies did his heart assail
Fill in great doubt of their dyuynayle
Thought he would make puru^aunce
For to withstonde gods ordenaunce
Full hard it is to make resistance
Ageyn thing ordained when god woll that it be
And namely there where as influence
Of heuyn above has shape a destyne
Some men record that no man may it flee
The dome of this where it hold or flytte
To astronomers all holy I committee
This said king of whom I spoke but lote
Cast he would for his advantage
The ordenaunce reuerse and the fate
Of the heuyn with all the surplusage
And give his daughter as in marige
To some unworthy pore unfortunate
That never were lykly to rise to hye estate
And in this wise king astriages
Married his daughter as in his intent
To one worthy called cambyses
Demynge thereby by short auisement
Within him silf that he was right prudent
Wenynge that noblesse came by descent of blood
And not by grace nor as the heuyn stood
In his reason was not comprehended
How socrates master of platon
Of full low bed by birth was descendyd
And not tenher^te kindome nor region
But for to have fully possession
Of moral virtue and philosofye
During his life his wit he did apply
He sought contrees for wysdam and science
And secret cu^nynges to search he did his pain
And he fond out through his dyligence
This philosophre as books acerteyne
To joy reserved outher to pain
By grace of god which is eternal
How mennys souls be found ay inmortall
The great appollo in bokys it is found
Gave judgment of equity and right
That socrattes in virtue most habounde
And most preferred in every mannys sight
Was called of wysdom the lantern and the light
And wisest named at even and at Pryme
Of philosophers that were in his time
The poet also called Euripides
Most honorable called in that age
All be his mother of life was recheles
And contagious through vicious outrage
Yet was this poet for all his vile lynage
Most virtuous found at assayes
Of all poets that were in his days
Called in his time a great tragicien
Because he wrote many tragedies
And would of toruth spare no manner man
But them rebuke in his peotries
Touching the vices of flesshly fantasies
Complain in princes their deeds most horrible
And each thing punisshe that was ^dyble
Another called clerk domestenes
The most subtle rethorician
And most Inuentif among all the pres
That ever was since the world began
Albe of birth he was a poor man
Yet had he most souereyne excellence
Among philophers of spech and eloquence
By which exaumple me seems doutles
That roial blood nor hye lynage
To mennys birth yeueth but small encres
Nor unto virtue but litell advantage
For hye nobles toketh not his courage
Of rich nor pore nor statys souereyne
But of his grace as god list ordeyne
Wherefore of folly king astriages
Contrariously again all gentrye
Bad that his daughter called mundanes
First when folk with child her did espy
For to accomphissh his froward fantasy
When it were borne chargynge above all thing
Of archanye to bear it to the king
Which in that time was called arpagus
And as I find he did in virtue flower
And spyte had the story tells thus
That bestes should the little child devour
But god that may in myscheef best socoure
To keep the child was not recheles
Again the malice of king astriages
Which had ca^maundyd of malice and hatred
How that this child grene and tentre of age
By arpagus should be cast in deed
To be devoured of bestes most savage
But for he dred to do so great outrage
To his shepeherde him silf to stand at large
The child to sle he fully yaue the charge
This herdman all be that he was loath
To execute this woeful adventure
Into a forest forth with the child he goth
And gave to bestes that little creature
Whom to fostre by grace again nature
A wild bitch her whilpes there forsake
And to her pappes the litell child she took
And with her milk she made him sup and dyne
And besy was for him to enchace
Wild f^u^ys and bestes sauagyne
That none ne durst neygh to that place
Loo how that god dispose can his grace
Innocents fro myscheef to preserve
Again falls envy which would make them sterue
O blood unkind found in kinrede
For couetise / o blood disnaturall
Of falls malice / o blood full of hatrede
To murdre a child borne of the stok royal
Where mannys reason is turned bestyall
Falsely transfourmed unto cruelte
To sle a child where bestes have pity
The cely heerde has told his wife the cas
And she anon of pity did arise
With her husbonde went a full great pas
Into the forest beholdinge all the guyse
As heretofore ye have herd deuyse
Seeing the child with lyppes tender and soft
The bytches pappes how he sook f^ll often
The said heerde called Sparag^
His wife also of whom tofore I (...)
This young child took in their dep^ (...)
And in her arms she softly began it (...)
And he full goodly her face began behold
And on his manner the same while
In childly wise on her began to smyle
The childs laughtre when she did aduerte
With all her hole feithful diligence
She began to cherisshe it and with all her heart
She yaue it soke with full great reverence
Albe the bitch made resistance
Compleynynge stood fully at abaye
The little child when she saw lad away
Full pitously she began to houl and cry
At their departing doolfully complain
And after them full fast began to hye
The child to let she felt so great a pain
Lo how that god of mercy can ordeyne
A cruel best such sorrow for to make
And so to mourn for a childs sake
But every thing that god will have preseruyd
May not fail to stand in sekernesse
His secre domys been to him silf reserved
There can no man expowne them as I guess
For he sh^pe first that this sheperdesse
Of sparagos the true pore wife
For to be mean to save the childys life
Home to her house the child she led ^^one
And it to fostre did her business
Of other salary god wot knew she none
Save that her heart thereto did her dress
And moore enteerly the story beryth w^tnesse
She tendryd him and with more besy (...)
Than him that was her child borne of nature
And as the story plainly does express
This young child as he wexe in age
Fro day to day encresyd in noblesse
Like for to be right manly of courage
Cirus he was called in that langage
To say in latin plainly in substance
A man yborne to great enheritaunce
And when the renoun of his excellence
By long process and of his great encresse
Came by the report unto the audience
Of his a^ell the great astriages
And how the king was found recles
Called arpagus for to do vengeance
On young cirus he fill in displesaunce
This is to mean astriages was wroth
That arpagus was found merciable
Cyrus to save and for that he was loath
Ageyns all right for to be vengeable
To sle a child a thing not comendable
Demynge of troth in his conscience
God was not paid to murdre Innocence
Astriages cast him to be wreke
On arpagus by falls collusion
Because that his bidding he did break
And was contrary to his intencion
Cirus to sle again all reason
And for that cause astriages I read
Of arpagus let sle the child in deed
This to say by falls compassinge
And covert mordre wrought by astriages
The son was slain of arpagus the king
And after rostyd alas full causeles
And since presented among all the pres
To sore his fader a thing most lamentable
With astriages he sat at the table
But when this king called arpagus
Conceived has this mordre most terrible
And how his son and heir was slain thus
In his Ire most furious and odible
In all the have that it was possible
He is repaired home to his household
And all the cas to Cirus he has told
And how his son was slain for his sake
In the most hatful odious crueltye
Excitynge him with him to undertake
On this false mordre auengyd for to be
To him declarynge of troth and equity
How he was borne by descent in deed
As right heir to regne in perce and mede
To him declarynge the story by and by
First of the dreme of astriages
And how that he by fraud full falsely
Made his daughter called Mundanes
Poorly to be wedded unto cambyses
Which was his mother and how in tender age
He was out cast to bestes full savage
By a shepperde and shepperdesse
Fosteryd he was in great pouerte
And brought from bestes out of wilderness
By cause god would he sauyd should be
For thilke lord which every thing may se
When that he has a thing before disposed
Nedys it must fall and may not be deposed
This said Cirus at his natiuyte
Ordained was by reuolucion
Of the heavenly sperys in noumbre thries three
So stood that time his constellacion
That he should have the domynacion
Over all asie by influence dyuyne
Before figured by spredynge of the vine
What may the fraud of slayghty folk avail
Innocents to put out of their right
Though troth be hyd among the parayle
Hard brought forth and dare not show his light
Yet god will ordeyne that the bemys bright
Shall some one day show out his cleernesse
Maugre all tho that would his title oppres^
For this Cirus as clerks of him write
Was by the title of his moders side
Borne to be king all asie to enherite
Albe his aiel from him would it diuyde
But god that can for troth best provide
Has for Cirus by process so ordained
That he of asie the lordshyp has atteyned
Cirus that time was grown up well of length
Well proporcioned of members and stature
Wonder deliver and passing of great strength
Strange emprises proudly to endure
And to Iupart and put in adventure
His own person the fame was of him so
Was none more lykly where men should have adoo
And by the counseyle of king arpagus
When this Cirus was well wax in age
With perciens proud and surquedous
And archanytes cruel of courage
For to recure his rightful heritage
Began with cirus armyd with plate and mayle
With astriages to hold battle
And he ag^ynewarde began to take heed
And with him took many a worthy knight
With all the puissaunce of the land of meede
Has take the field the same day forth right
To disherite cirus of his right
But god and troth was atwene them tweyne
Egall judge their quarrel to dareyne
The feeld ordained and splayed their baners
On outher party full proudly on they set
At thassemblynge like lions of their cheres
In the face as they fresshly met
With round speres sharp ground and w^et
Till that Cirus of grace more than noumbre
Of his aiel the party did encombre
This mighty Cirus this young champion
Throughoute the feeld began such a slaughter make
With his knightis as he went up and down
That as the death his fomen him forsake
Astriages under his baner take
The feelde venquesshed for all his false veynglorye
To show that right has alwey the victory
A man of malice may a thing purpose
By a manner froward prouydence
But god above can graciously dispose
^geyne such malice to make resistance
^en for a while may suffer violence
and wrongs great where so that they wend
^ut troth alwey venquessheth at end
Astriages fond full soth his dreme
Though he again it made purueaunce
To have depryu^d Cirus of his rem
He was deceived of his ordenaunce
For where that god th^ugh his mighty puissaunce
List for heiris iustfy to provide
Slight in such cas of man is set aside
Maugre the might of astriages
Cirus on him made a disconfiture
And all asie reioysed eke in pees
Of very right as was his adventure
And by just title he did also recure
The loud of mede like as was his fate
And into perce he did it hole translate
Again his a^l he was not vengeable
Which had wrought to his distruccion
But was to him benign and merciable
And grauntyd him of hole affection
The forte part of the region
Of archanye of which before I told
Him to sustain in his days old
For king Cirus would not his live
Suffer his a^l of very gentilnesse
That men should him finally depryue
Of kingly honor for none unkindness
To give exaumple to princes in sothnesse
Though god in earth have y^uyn them might
They should ay mercy meddle with the right
Lenuoye.
NOble princes your erys do enclyne
And considre in your discrecions
How dremys showed by influence byuyne
Be not like sweuenys but like auysions
Or resemble to reuolucions
Which though men would distourbe and make fail.
God will not suffer their malice to prevail
A stragies dempt he saw a vine
Showed of troth and none illusions
From his daughters womb right alyne
Spread in asie over the regions
But to disherite by falls collusions
Young Cirus the king did his travail
But god not suffered his malice to prevail
Princes remember that in honor shine
Upon this story in your entencions
And be well wyllyd where god list forthre a line
Outher to riches or dominacions
To favor them to their promocions
Be not contrary in your acquytaile
Sith god will suffer no malice to prevail
How Candalus king of Lide was made cokwold and after slain
wHile John bochas cast his look aside
In his study as he sat wrytinge
To his presence came the king of Lyde
Called Candalus full pitously pleyiung
With salt teris full lowly besechinge
That he would swage his greuaunce
His dedly sorrow to put in remembrance
His compleynt was most of unkindness
For falls deceyt again all skyll and right
That where his trust was most of gyntylnesse
He mocked was for all his great might
For of his house there was a certain knight
Gyges called thing shameful to be told
To speak plain Inglissh made him a cokolde
Alas I was not auised will be forne
Vncu^nyngly to speak such langage
I should have said how that he had an horn
Or sought some teeme with a fair visage
To excuse my rudnesse of this great outrage
As in some land Cornodo men do them call
And some afferme how such folk have no gall
Thus was the cas when phoebus shone shene
The somer ceason in his assencion
When sote branches were clad in new grene
Hete importable had dominacion
When that the queen for recreacion
Unprovided that no man did her keep
Upon her bed lay nakyd for to sleep
And as clerkys of her beute write
There was on live none fairer creature
Nor more excellynge like as they endyte
Of f^m^lynesse her story does assure
Called for bewtye cosyn to nature
And worthy eke if I shall not feign
To be compared to Grisilde or Eleyne
Kind in her forge list no thing to err
When she her wrought by great auisenesse
To make of beute the very lode sterre
And give her beute favor and semelynesse
But for nature had so great besynes
To form a woman that was so fressh of hew
She had forgete for to make her true
Her iyen were very celestyall
Her here vntressed like phoebus in his spear
A thing resembling that were immortal
So angelyk she was of look and chere
An examplarye of port and manner
There was no lack save nature through her sloth
Had left behind to give her faith and troth
And on a day as she lay slepynge
Nakyd on bed most goodly to sight
Full unwarily came candalus the king
Into the chaumbre where titan shone full bright
And showed her beutye unto his own knight
Of intent he should bear witness
How she excelled all other in fayrenesse
And when Giges began in order se
Of this queen the great excellence
He was enamoured upon her beutye
All the while he stood there in presence
Began ymagyne a treason in silence
To sle his lord without long taryenge
Win the queen and after regne as king
This was the end dolful and pitous
To be remembered hateful and terrible
Of this noble worthy candalus
For of his trust to much he was credyble
Unto Gyges the traitoure was o^yble
And yet more folisshe whereby he lost his life
Outward to show the beutye of wife
Though she were fair and goodly unto see
There was no trust nor no se^y^nesse
For other had as good part as he
Gyges could bear thereof witness
Alas a queen or any great princess
Assent should her fame for to trouble
But if nature excuse them to double
How what thing king Midas touchid was gold yet dyed he in miserye and
wretchydnesse
But who so ever was therewith loath or feign
Gyges was after crowned king of lyde
When that his lord was by treason slain
Of him the surplus bochas set aside
And in his study as he did abide
There came of frige mydas the rich king
Told mine auctoure his compleynt with wepinge
For there was never by conquest nor labor
No king before that had more richesse
Nor more plente of gold nor of tresoure
At whoos birth poets thus express
About his cradell amptis began him dress
While he slepte and began about him leyne
A full great noumbre of pured whete greyne
Whereupon most expert diuynours
As they took head in their attendaunce
Such as were best expositours
Said it was a tokyn of habundaunce
To have of richesse al manner suffisaunce
And concludynge plainly began to tell
How he all other in tresour should excel
Poetys of him wrote that were full old
Bachus gave him the mighty god of wine
What he touches shall turn into gold
As good as that which came out of the mine
At al assayes to be as pure and fine
This request as writes Ouidius
Was unto Midas grauntyd of bachus
He thought gold might him most avail
What he handlyd was gold with touching
But when hungre his stomach began assail
His bred his mete was clear gold in showing
And when he began to fail of his fedynge
And fond of gold no recure to escape
Besought Bachus some remedy to shape
Bachus bad him go bath in a river
To wassh away the color aureat
Where it is showed the goldy grauel clear
Which example declares to each estate
That gold allone makes men not fortun^t
For what may gold or tresoure there avail
Where men in hungre find no vitayle
Or what is worthy gold peerle or stones red
Grene Emeroudys or sciphirs ynde
When men enfamyned have neither greyne ne bread
Nor in such mysche^f vytaile may none find
For to fosture their nature and their kind
A barley loof in such a distr^sse
More might avail than all wordly richesse
This knew mydas and was expert in deed
Though he of gold had so great plente
That with metal he might him silf not feed
Which caused him of necessite
To considre and clearly for to see
That bread more vayleth for fosterynge of nature
Than all richesse that men may h^re recure
For which this king began hate all richesse
Gold and tresoure he had eke in disdeyne
Left his crown and his roial noblesse
And chase to keep sheep upon a pleyne
All wordly worship was to him but vein
Of malencoly and froward pouerte
Endyd his lif in great aduersite
For of ire and impacience
Finally thus with him it stood
Furiously in his great indigence
As writes bochas how he drank the blood
Of a bole sauagyne and wode
With love enchaufed made no delays
Most bestyally endyd thus his days
Of balthazar king of babilone / and how daniel expowned. Mane. Techel.
Phares.
nExt to bochas or that he was w^^e
As he sat writing with full great labor
Of babilone came great balthasare
To declare his sorrow and his langoure
Which had mysused full falsely the tresoure
And the vessels brought to Jerusalem
In babylon cheef cite of his rem
For at a souper with his lords all
When of the vessels he drank mighty wynes
And solemply sat in his royal stall
And round about all his concubynes
Philophers magiciens and dyuynes
There came an hand the bible does assure
And on the wall began write this scripture
Mane techel phares wretyn in his sight
Though he the menynge conceived neueradell
Which on the wall showed fair and bright
Fro whose sentence auayled no^e appele
But the prophet holy danyel
Fully expowned to balthazar the king
This mysterye of this derke writynge
This word mane plainly and not tarry
In latin tunge betokens in substance
The days counted and rekened the noumbrarye
Of thy regnynge and of thy great substance
And techel sowneth a weyenge in balaunce
In tokyn thy power and kingdom by mesure
God has them peysed they shall no while endure
Phares also betokens a brekinge
In romayne tunge into pecis small
For thy power and froward r^bellynge
Shall from the hye be brought into the vale
This is holy wryt and no feigned tale
For when princes will not their life redress
God will unwarily their surquedye repress
Thou were by tokyns warnyd long before
By many exaumples the story ye may ride
By the falling of Nabugodonosore
And thou thereof took full^ litell head
The lord to thank and have his name in dread
For which thou shall within a l^tell throw
Lose scepter and crown and be brought full low*
Let princes all thi^ ^tory have in mind
And for them silfe notably provide
And namely the that been to god unkind
Their concubynes for to set aside
And make virtue for to be there guide
Void lecherye and falls presumpcion
Which has brought so many to destruction
Nabugodonosor had repentance
And was restoryd to his possessions
But god of right took suddenly vengeance
On Balthazar for his transgressions
Wherefore ye princes dispose your reasons
After your merits to have god merciable
For your demerites to find him vengeable
Again holy church take no quarelis
But advertise in your inward sight
For Balthazar drank of tho vessellis
Stale fro the temple of very force and might
He lost lordship and lif upon a night
So that the kingdom of assiriens
Translatyd was to mede and perciens
Lo Cresus and balthazar were venquesshed by cirus and the son of cresus
slain at the hu^ting of a bore
NExt to John bochas within a throw
Writing of princes many pytous fate
he saw king cresus with other on the row
Lowly besechinge his falling to translate
And how fortune again him began debate
And of his micheef doolful for to read
For to descryue anon he began proceed
For as it is remembered in writing
As god and kind list for him ordeyne
Of Lyde he was governor and king
And lordship had the story can not feyne
Of many kyngdoms more than one or tweyne
Fame in that time so did him magnyfie
That he was called flower of all chyualrye
And he was also in his time found
The most expert in werre and in bateyle
And of richesse was the most habounde
And most exallinge in conquest to prevail
Plente of people with roial apparaile
And with all this to his great advantage
Noumbre of children tenblysshe his lynage
In the most highest of his royal see
And all was well and no thing stood amys
Yet ta^^^use his felicite
A dreme he had and truly that was this
How that his son which called was athis
Was take from him and by mortal outrage
Slain suddenly in his tender age
This woeful dreme did him great distress
And put his heart in great dispeyre
Stondynge in fere and great heaviness
Because his child tender young and fair
Which that was borne for to be his heir
Should causeles in such myscheef dye
So as his dreme before did specify
Of this process to declare more
How cresus dreme fulfilled was in deed
From olimphus there came a wild bore
Most furious and sauagyne of dread
With fomy tosshes which fast began him speed
Down descendynge and no where list abide
Till that he came into the land of lyde
And began distroye their fruits and their vynes
Where ever he came in any manner place
Brake the nets and the strong lines
Of the hunters that did at him enchace
But under supporte of the kings grace
His son of whom I spoke tofore
Gate him license to hunte at this bore
His fader cresus demynge of this cas
There was no cause of dread in no manner
Though his son were present at the chas
With other hunters such game for to lere
But aye fortune with her double chere
Is ready ever by some fatal treyne
At such disportes some myscheef to ordeyne
For one there was which had governance
Upon this child to wait and to se
Chasynge the bore to save him fro myschaunce
From all damage and aduersite
Which many lusty folk of that cuntre
With horns hounds and sharp speres ground
Seeking the bore till they had him found
And as they began feersly the bore enchace
He that was charged to be the childs guide
As with his spear he began the bore manace
The head not entryd but forth bygan to glyde
And on the child which that stood beside
The stroke alight and or hedyd aduerte
The speres head rose him throught the heart
But of this child when the death was couth
Told and reported holy the manner
How he was slain in his tender youth
Borne to be heir unto his fader dear
Cresus for sorrow chaungyd look and cher^
And for constreynt of dool in his visage
He resembled a very deed image
But every sorrow by long contynuaunc^
At the last it sumwhat must aswage
For there is none so furious greuaunce
Nor so mortal Importable rage
But long process yeueth him advantage
I mean as thus there is none so great a sorrow
But it might cese outher eve or morrow
Philosophers concluden and discern
And by their reasons recorden by scripture
Thing violent may not be eterne
Not in one point abides none adventure
Nor a sorrow may not alwey endure
For s^oundmel^ through fortunys variaunce
There follows joy after great greuaunce
The sorrow of Creses though it were intolerable
And at his heart the greuaunce sat so sore
Since that his dole was irrecupable
And mean was none his harms to restore
Mine auctor Bochas writes of his woe no more
But of his fall how he fill in deed
To tell the manner forth he does proceed
And for a while he set his style aside
And his process in pertye he forbear
To speak of Cressus that was king of lyde
And began resort to write of Balthazar
Again rehersinge or that he was war
How mighty Cirus of woeful adventure
Made on him proudly a disconfiture
And as it is put in remembrance
Of Balthazar to hold up the party
Cresus with him had made an aliaunce
With all his puissaunce and all his chyualrye
His lif his tresoure to put in Iupertye
Sworn in arms as brother unto brother
By Cirus venquesshed that one after that other
^oth their myscheef no longer was delaied
Albe that Cresus faught long in his diffence
He finally by Cirus was outrayed
And depryued by knightly violence
Take in the field there was no resistance
And rigourously to his confusion
With mighty feters cast in derke prison
And more to encreace his great aduersite
A son of his / tender and young of age
That was dumb from his natiuite
And never spoke word in no manner langage
Cirus co^maundynge by furious outrage
That Cresus should by vengeable cruelte
By a knight of Perce in prison hedyd be
And with his sword as he began manace
Cresus to have slain without all reverence
The dombe child there p^sent in the place
Which never had spoken thus said in audience
Withdraw thy stroke and do no violence
Unto my lord thy fame so to confound
To sle a king that lies in prison bound
The knight astonyed has his stroke forborne
Greatly abashed in that derke habitacle
Which herd a child that never spoke toforne
Again his sword to make an obstacle
Ran and told this marvelous miracle
To mighty Cirus with every circumstaunce
Hopinge thereby to atempred his greuaunce
But where as tyrauntes been set on cruelte
Their crokyd malice full hard is to appese
So indurate is their iniquite
That all in vengeance is set their hertis ese
Themsilf reioisinge to se folks in disease
Like as they were in their froward danger
Clenly fraunchised fro god and his power
This cruel Cirus most vengeable of des^^^
To execute his fell intent in deed
Let make in have of faggot a great fire
And began them kyndle with many colys read
And made Cresus quakynge in his dread
For to be take where as he lay full low
And bad men should into the fire him throw
But Iubiter which has his vengeance seyne
How cruel Cirus with malice was atteyne
From heuyn sent a tempest and a reyne
That suddenly the horrible fire was quaynt
Woeful Cresus with dredeful fire made faint
Escapyd is his furious mortal pain
God and fortune for him lift so ordeyne
This adventure in manner merueylous
The heart of Cirus began sumwhat to enbrace
And caused him for to be pitous
Again gresus and grauntyd him this grace
To occupye while he has lift and space
The land of Lyde except only this thing
He should not after be called king
And thus of lyde the king did fine
Which took his beginning of one ardisius
And endured the space of kings nine
Look whosoever will the bokys tell thus
Hereof no more but forth unto Cirus
I will proceed with all my besy cure
For to translate his woeful adventure
How the cruel tyrant Cyrus delited eu^ slaughter and shedynge of blood and
so endyd
Heir by descent to great astriages
Poorly brought forth as made is mention
And had al asie to his gr^ate encres
Holding that rigne by just sucession
In long quyete wihtout rebillyon
Till time he thought in full froworde wise
The world was small to staunch his couetise
He had an Etyke most contagious
Fretinge upon him for desire of good
A dropsy hateful and ^urious
Of froward rage that made his heart wode
A w^fuy^^^e ^a^ast to shede mannys blood
Which ouer^^horted by falls malencolye
His (...) into tyranny
But when he presumptuously entende
To rob (...) through his pillage
God and fortune made him to descend
Full suddenly from his (...) ^^age
(...) was a great advantage
To (...) of very fo^e and might
Though (...) of right
To (...) souereyn^e
^

Above sad ^^outh and (...)
Which causes princes from their estate royal
Or they be ware to have es^deyn fall
For the lordshyp of all as^^
Might not suffice to cirus gredynesse
But thought he would conquer ^ithia
And there werre to encreace his great richesse
Though he no title had of rightousnesse
Save a falls lust whereof men should have ruth
That will in princes should oppress truth
First this cirus all princes did excelle
Both in conquest victory and battle
Of gold and tresoure as books him tell
Kingdoms to win he did most prevail
And yet to vices did his heart assail
First couetise ever to encreace in good
With a desire to sh^de mennys blood
With two vices he brenneth ever in one
That never might from his heart twynne
Made a great arm toward Septemtrion
And cast him proudly to set on and begin
Cithia the mighty land to win
Queen thamacis there regnynge as I find
Whoos kingdom Joins unto ethiopie in ynde
Toward the party which is oriental
The sea of suri^e flows full plentuus
Down to the sea called occidentall
And southwarde renneth to Concasus
And folk of cythie that been laborious
Which tyle the land has not to their living
But only frutys which from the earth spring
The land of Cithie is rich for the nonys
From greyne and fruit a land full couenable
Rich of gold peerle and precious stonys
Right comodious and wonder delectable
But a great party is not habytable
The people dredful to belde their mancions
For feer of death because of the griffou^s
The noble fame nor the high renou^
Was not far know nor Isprad about
Of Thamaris queen of that rigion
Nor of her noblesse within nor without
Till that king Cyrus with a full great route
Into ^^his began him proudly dress
The hardy queen to spoil of her richesse
But she her fame more to magnify
Began in great have with full rich apparayle
Full prudently assemble her chiualrye
And took a feelde if he would her assail
Ready with him to have a batayel
And of her meyne like as seyth my book
Unto her son the thryd part she took
And yaue him charge in the same place
Him silf that day to acquyte like a knight
And for to mete Cirus in the face
And no thing dread with him for to fight
But when king cirus of him had a sight
Cast him that day the young prince oppress
Rather by wyles than manhood or prowess
First he let stuff his large pauilions
With great plente of drinks delectable
Diverse metes and confeccions
Round about upon every table
And in his menynge passinge deceyuable
Like as he had in manner dreadful be
Took all his host and began anon to fle
This young prince of menynge Innocent
Nothing demynge as by supposayle
But that cirus was with his meyne went
And fled for fere he durst him not assail
And when he fond such plente of vetayle
He and his knights through misgouernaunce
To ete and drink set all their plesaunce
They had of knighthode lost all the disciplyne
Forsook mars and put him out of sight
And to Bachus their hedes began enclyne
Gorge upon gorge till it drough to night
And proud Cirus came on them anon right
With all his often they out of their armure
On bestyall folk made a disconfiture
Cruel cirus left none alive
Of high nor low made none excepcion
They were to feeble again his might to strive
For cheef cause of their destruction
Was drunkenesse which voideth all relacion
And wise men rehercen in sentence
Where folk be dronkyn there is no resistance
And when this slaughter by relacion
Reportyd was and brought to the presence
Of Thamaris queen of that region
Unto her heart it did full great offense
But of ire and great impacience
Seeing her son slain in tender age
For sorrow almoost she fill into a rage
But for all her woeful dedly pain
She showed no tokyn of femynyte
But of prudence her wepyi^ began restreynt
And cast her pleynly avenged for to be
Upon king cirus and on his cruelte
Sent out meyne tespien his passage
If she him find might at advantage
And with her meyne began feyne amaner flight
Up to the mounteynes dredefull and terrible
And cirus after began have him anon right
In hope to take her if it were possible
Among which hills more than it is credyble
Been craggy roches most hidous of enteyle
Perilous of passage and vode of all vitayle
And cirus there fill in great daungere
All unpurveyed of drogemen or of guide
To fostre his people vitayle was none there
Erringe as bestes upon every side
And they of cithie began for him so provide
Whereof their queen god wot was full feign
At great myscheef that all his men were slain
None of all was take to raunson
Nor he him silf escaped not her bounds
Such wait was laid to their destruction
And he through percyd with many mortal wounds
On pecis rent as b^ers been with hounds
The queen comaundynge when he lay thus to torn
To her presence this body to be borne
First she has charged to smite of his head
When she has thus the victory of him won
And in a bath that was all blood read
She ganne it throw within a little tonne
And of despyte right thus she has begone
Most tirauntly in her woeful rage
To deed cirus to have this langage
O thou cirus that whilom were so wode
And so thrustleugh in thy tyranny
Again nature so to shede mannys blood
So wuluysshe was thyn hatfull dropsye
That mercy non might it modefye
Thyn etike joined gredy and unstable
With thrust of slaughter ^p to be vengeable
It is an horror in manner for to think
So great a prince rebuked for to be
Of a woman mannys blood to drink
For to disclaundre his royal majesty
Out gladly ever vengaeble cruelte
Bf right requires with unware violence
Blood shed for blood justly to recompense
OF mighty cirus the imperial nablesse
Was by a woman ve^quesshed and borndoun
God made her chastise his furious wodnesse
And for to oppress his famous high renoun
For where vengeance has domynacion
In worldly princes plainly to devise
With unware stroke god can them well chastise
The end of cirus can bear full well record
How god withstondith folee that been vengeable
Lordship and mercy when they been at discord
Right will not suffer their state to stand stable
And for this cirus was so vnmerciable
He with vnmercy punysshed was in deed
Death quyt for death lo here his fynall mede
In slaughter and blood he did him most delight
For in tho thweyne was his repast in deed
He fond no mercy his vengeance to respite
Where he fond matter any blood to shede
Such joy he had by death to se folk blede
And for the sight did him so much good
His fatal end was for to swymme in blood
Lo here thexequies of this mighty king
Lo here the end of his estate royal
There were no flawmes nor brondes clear shynynge
To brenne his body with fyres funeral
Nor obseruaunces nor offringes marciall
Nor toumbe of gold with stonys rich and fine
Was none ordained that day to make his shryne
Epithaphie there was none red nor sunge
Be no poet with their poetries
Nor of his triumphs there was no bell rung^
Nor no wepers with subbinge tragedyes
None attendaunce but of his enmyes
Which of hatred in their cruel rage
Cast out his cateyn to bestes most savage
Lo here of cirus the fynall adventure
Which of all asie was whilom emperor
Now lyth he abject with out sepulture
Of high nor low he fond no better favor
Lo here the fine of all worly labor
Namely of tyrauntys which list not god to dread
But set their lust to slaughter and blood to shede
Lenuoye.
RIght noble princes concidre in your sight
The fine of Cirus pitous and lamentable
How god punysshth of equite and right
Tyrauntys echone cruel and vengeable
For in his sight it is abhomynable
That a prince as philosophers write
In slaughter of men should him silf delight
This said cirus was a full manly knight
In beginning right famous and notable
Nature yaue him semlynesse and might
For in conquest was none seen more able
Till tyranny the serpent deceyueable
Merciles his courage did atwyte
In slaughter of men when him began delight
Wherefore ye princes remember both day and night
Tafforce your noblesse and make it perdurable
To get you favor and love of every wight
Which shall your statys conserve and keep stable
For there is conquest none so honorable
In governance as vengeance to respite
Mercy preferrynge in slaughter not delight
How amilius for couetise slough his brother and Remus / and Romulus norisshed
by a wuluesse
aFter king cirus bochas did espy
Two worthy brethren with facis pitous
Borne by descent to regne in albanye
Both of one fader the story tells us
The one of them called Amylyus
And to remember the name of that other
Muniter I called was his brother
They had a fader which named was prochas
King of that land the story does deuyse
After whoos death pleynly this the cas
Amilius for falls couenese
His brother slough in full cruel wise
That he unjustly by falls tyranny
Might have the kingdom alone of albany^
This albana by description
Like as bochas affermeth in certain
Is a cite not far fro rome tou^
Set on an hill beside a large pleyn
The beldinge statly rich and well beseyne
Strong walled with many a rich toure
And ascannis was first thereof fondoure
Which callid was in his fundacion
Albania for the great witness
The^e kings after by succession
Named albonoys princes of great noblesse
And by descent the story bears witness
From king prochas record on books old
Came these two brethren / Rea there suster told
Muniter slain as made is mention
The king occupied by amilius
And rea entered into religion
For to be wympled in that holy house
Sacryd to vesta with virgynes glorious
Therefore to a bide and be contemplatyf
With other maydyns duringe all her lif
And this was done while she was young of age
By her brother of falls entencion
That she should have no manner heritage
Nor claim no title in that region
Of her kinrede by none accasion
But stand professyd in virginyte
Tofore vesta and live in chastity
Yet natwitstandynge her virginal clennesse
She has conceived by natural miracle
Began to encreace in her holiness
Whoos womb aros in kind was none obstacle
Again such bolnynge avails no tryacle
But the goddess for her so did ordeyne
That she at onys had sons tweyne
The temple of vesta stood in wilderness
Where Rea had holy the ^ouernaunce
Of preesily honor done to the gods
With many strange uncouth obseruaunce
But by her brothers mortal ordenaunce
Her young sons might not be socoured
But cast out to bestes for to be devoured
But a she wulfe which whelpyd had late
To give them soke did her business
By god ordained or by some heavenly fate
Them to conserve fro death in their distress
For holy writ plainly bears witness
God can diffende as it is well couth
Children from myscheef in their tender youth
But in this while this said amilius
That was their uncle as made is mention
Again his sustre froward and furious
Made her be sh^t in a full derke prison
And there compleynynge the destruction
Of her two children borne to her repreef
For very sorrow dyed at great myscheef
These said children deuoyde of all refute
Beside a river lay pitously cryenge
From all socoure nakyd and destitute
Except a wulues upon them waytinge
At whoos womb full still they lay soukinge
Unto nature a thing contrarious
Children to souke on bestes raueynous
But he this lord of every creature
Right as him list can both save and spyll
And bestes which been rage of their nature
He can aduerte and make them lie full still
Tygres lions obeyen at his will
The same lord has made a fell wulues
Unto tweyne children her biggys for to dress
And while this wulues had them in depos
There came an herd called Faustulus
Beheld their soukynge and saw them lie full clos
Which shepperde was of king amilius
Caught up these children the story tells thus
And brought them forth with great diligence
Unto his wife that called was laurence
And she for love did her besy pain
Them to fostre till they came of age
Gave them souke of her breasts tweyne
Fro day to day of heart and hole courage
And they were called as in that langage
After the story that one of them remus
And the second was named romulus
Of which brethern breuely to termyne
The town of rome to ^e origynall
Of falls disclaundre first began that line
The rote out sought full vicious found at all
Clearly remembered for a memorial
Their beginning grew of such incontinence
As clerks call incestus in sentence
Incestus is a thing not fair nor good
After that books well devise cu^n^
As trespassinge with kyn or with blood
Or froward medlynge with her that is a nu^ne
And th^^s the line of rome was begu^ne
For slaughter murdre and falls robbrye
Was cheef beginning of all their auncetrye
Of couetise they took their advantage
Ligge^s of weys and robber^ openly
Murdrers also of their own lynage
And strong theuys gate to their cumpany
Spoiled all tho that past them forby
Under shadow of kepinge their berstaile
All manner people they proudly did assail
To sle marchauntys they had no conscience
And for to murdre folk of every age
Wymen to oppress of force and violence
In all that cuntre this was their usage
Where they abode there was no sure passage
And these two brethren like as it is found
Fond first the manner of speris sharp ground
A spear in greek called is quiris
And for that cause the said romulus
As books say and sothely so it is
He afterward was called quirinus
Which with his brother that called was Remus
Was in all thing confederat and partable
That (...) was vious and dampnable
And a^ i^ (...) according to their life
For lak of virtue they fill in great diffame
And atwene them there was an uncouth strif
Which of both should give the name
Unto the cite atwene ernest and gain
After their names come to be called
Thus fill the cas before or it was walled
And thereupon full long lasted their stryues
Which should of them have domynacion
Showing their tilles and prerogatyues
Who should of them give name to the town
And regne as king in that region
There was no reason who should go beforne
Because they were both at onys borne
But to fynyssh their fraternall discord
They have provided atwene them anon right
Thus condescendinge to put them at acorde
Nouther by force oppression nor might
That (...) of them saw grettest flight
Of (...) flyenge high upon ^n hill
Should name the cite at his own will
Of this accord for to be witness
They with them led a full great multitude
Throf to give adome of rightwisnesse
Both of wise and of people rude
All at onys this matter to conclude
And to an hill called auentyne
They been ascended this matter for to fine
And bryddes six to remus did appear
By augurye as they began proceed
Called vultures full feers in there manner
But in noumbre the double did excede
That romulus saw when he took good head
Whereof there fill a great contrauersye
Which of them should prevail on his pertye
Thus first of all remus had a sight
Of six birds called vultures
And for to auaunce and prefer his right
He full proudly put him silf in prees
But romulus was not recheles
His brothers claim plainly to entrouble
Afforced his title with the noumbre double
Yet of his purpos one of them must fail
Though it so be that they ever strive
But Romulus began finally prevail
And to the cite he forth went blyue
And as auctours list ^chone discryue
And in their books as they reherce all
After his name rome he did it call
An^ all foreyns to exclude out
And again them to make strong diffence
First he began to wall i^ round about
And made a law full dredefull in sentence
Who clymbe the wall by any violence
Outward or inward there is no more to seye
By statute made he must nedys dye
This was enact by full pleyne ordinance
In pain of death which no man break shall
But so befell remus of ignorance
Which of the statute knew no thing atall
Of adventure went over the wall
For which a knight ordeyn in certain
The seyde remus has with a pykeys slain
His brother list^at in no manner wise
Again the law to be favorable
But assented parcel for couetyse
Upon remus to be more vengeable
Of this intent to make his regne stable
That he alone might govern and none other
By no claim found nor brought in by his brother
And that the people should them more delight
There to abide and have possession
As old auctours of romulus do write
Within the bounds of the same town
That he devised by great provision
In cumpas round so chronicles compile
A teritorye that called was asile
This asilum by romulus devised
^as a place of refuge and socours
Like a theater with libertees fraunchised
For to receive all foreyn trespassours
Theuys murderers weyliggers and robbours
By great resort within the walls wide
To fostre all brybours that durst no where abide
And with fled people fro diverse regions
The cite began to encrece and multyplye
And banyshed folk of strange nations
To find refuge thidre began them hye
And thus by process began their chivalry
F^^st through tyrauntes recheles of werkynge
Till all the world obeyed their biddynge
Of wylfull force without title of right
They brought all people under subjection
A^leyme they made by violence and might
And took no head of troth nor reason
And the first auctour of their fundacion
Was romulus that gadryd all this route
Within the cite and wallyd it about
And many day as made is mention
He had this cite in his governance
And was the first king crowned in that town
And reigned there by contynuaunce
Full many ^erys till the variaunce
Of fortune through her falls envy
In campania made him for to dye
Upon a day when it began thundre loud
His name for ever to be more magnefied
Su^me books ^ay he was rapt in a cloud
High up in heuene to be stellified
With other goddys statly deif^ed
There to be stalled by jupiters side
Like for his knights as mars list provide
Lo here of panymes a falls opinion
To cristes law contrary and odious
That tyrauntes should by falls opprossion
Be called goddys or named glorious
Which by their live were found vicious
For this pleyne troth I dare it well tell
They rather been fendes full deep in hell
For but in earth their domynacion
Conveyed been by virtuous noblesse
And that their power and high renoun
Be set on troth and rightwisnesse
Like their estates in prince or princess
I dare afferme of them both tweyne
For vicious living they must endure pain
But when they been feythfull of intent
Right and troth justly to mayntene
And in their royal power be not blen^
Wrongs redressinge and pore folk sustene
And so contune with concscience most clean
Such life more rathe than pomp of worldly we^^ys
Shall make them regne in heuene above the sterrys
For which late princes understand atonys
And worldly princessys with all their great riches
That their high hornys fret with rich stones
Toward heuene their passage does not dress
But virtuous life charity and meekness
When they list pride out of there heart arace
That causes them in heuene to win a place
There is no more strange abusion
Nor tofore god great ydolatrye
Than when princes list catch affecion
Creatures falsely to deifie
Be collusion brought in by sorcerye
Now god defend all princes well disposed
With such falls craft never to be enoysed
And their iyen by none illusions
Be not englued nouther with hoke nor line
Nor by no boytes of falls inspeccions
Wrought by cyrenes by drink or medecyne
Which of their nature resemble to a shryne
Through richesse outward and beutye souereyne
And who look inward be like a foul careyne
God of his grace amend all such outrage
In noble princes and save them from such werre
And them enlumyne disposinge their courage
In such falls worship they no more ne err
Like to argus that they seen afcere
That no false fagynge cause them to be blind
Goddys nor goddessys to worship again kind
And though that romans did worship and honor
To romulus by a constreynt dread
Let no man take exaumple of their error
But to that lord whoos sides were made read
To save mankind and on a cross was deed
Let men to him in cheef their love observe
Which can them quyte better than they can deserve
How mecyus king of albanoys being falls of his oath and assurance / was
drawn into pecys
NExt romulus with ^erys albe sprent
Unto John bochas apperyd mecius
Of chere and look and of his port faint
His fall declarynge froward and despitous
And he was called eke sufficius
Low of birthe and simple in vpgrowynge
Of Albanoys till fortune made him king
Again whoos pride the romans began warreye
Full mightily oppressinge his cuntre
And for king mecius list them not obey
They cast them fully avenged for to be
Because his birth was but of low degree
And was risen up unto estate royal
They them purpos to give him a sodeyn fall
Hasty clymbynge of pouert set on hight
When wrong title makes him to ascend
With unware peys of his own might
A sodeyn fall makes him to descend
When he list not of surquedye entende
Fro whens he came nor him silfe to know
Till god and fortune his pomp has overthrow
For this mecius of presumpsion
Thought again romans his pride might avail
Began werre again them by rebellion
Was not feerfull their noblesse to assail
Till on a day was signed abaytaile
Both their ostys within a feelde to mete
To take their part whether it be sour or sweet
That time in rome reigned hostilius
A manly man and a full worthy knight
Tweyne him concludyd and king mecius
They tweyne to mete in steel armyd bright
For both batayls to try out the right
By just accord and therein not varye
The party venquesshed to be tributary
And holy put him in subieccion
Without entretynge or any more delay
And finally for short conclusion
King hostilius the triumph wanne that day
That albanoys could not say nay
But that romans as put is memory
By singular battle had won the victory
Thus had romans first possession
Of albanoys to obey them and to dread
Mecius yielded and sworn to the town
Never to rebel for favor ne for mede
But he was double found in deed
Of his assurance and falls to their cite
He was chastised anon as ye shall see
Again Fidenates a cuntre of Itayle
King hostilius for their rebellion
Cast he would mete them in bataile
For common profit and for diffencion
Both of his cite and of his royal town
And for to afforce his party in werkinge
Of albanoys he sent unto the king
To come in have with his hoole chyualrye
And tarry not in no manner wise
But make him strong to sustain his party
Like his behest as ye have hard deuyse
But king mecius full falsely began practyse
A sleighty treason and a covert wyle
Ageyn his promys the romans to begyle
Yet he outward pretendynge to be true
Came to the feelde with a full great meyne
Living in hope to see some chaungis new
That he on rome might auengyd be
And specially that he might se
King hostilius of froward envy
That day outrayed with all his ch^ualrie
First when he saw the romans enbatailed
And fidynates on that other side
Their wardys ready for to have assailed
He covertly did on an hill abide
And to nor fro list not goo nor ride
^or his person put in Iupartye
But who was strengest to hold on that pertye
Whereof the romans fill in suspeccion
Of ^inge meenis when they took head
^ill hostilius of high discrecion
Through his knighthode put them out of dread
And began dissinule of meenis the falshede
And to conforte his knights of intent
^^yde what he did was done by his assent
(...) was full loath that his chyualrie
(...) know theffect of me^nis treason
Which cause might in all or in party
Full great hindringe by some occasion
^o deem in him falsnesse or treson
Yet of troth the story bears witness
All that he meant was untruth and falsnesse
Thus of manhood and of high prudence
He to his knights yaue heart and hardynesse
Made them set on by so great violence
^^at he the feelde gate of high prowes
^n fydynates brought in so great distress
And so outrayed on force on every side
Tofore romans that they ne durst abide
And when mecius saw them thus outrayed
By a manner of feyned falls gladness
Like as he had in heart be well paid
To hostilius anon he began him dress
Him silf reioisinge by counterfeit likeness
And for his menynge plainly was conceived
So as he came right so he was received
Thus when mecius stood in his presence
With a pretense of feithfull stablenesse
And all thapport of troth in appearance
He shadowed has his expert doubleness
Under sote honey covert bitterness
Freendly visage with words smoth and plain
Though mouth and heart departed were in twain
But hostilius has all his fraud espied
And his compassed falsnesse and treson
And thereupon has justly fantasyed
A pain according I peysed of reason
Him to punyssh by a double passion
This to mean like as he was divided
A double torment for him he has provided
This was his dome and his fatal pain
By hostilius contryued of justice
his fete his armies atwene charettys tweyne
Naked and bare the story does devise
To be bound and knyt in trauers wise
Contrariously the horse to draw and hale
Till all his body were rent on pecis small
And right as he was cause of great trouble
Found ay in deed most full of variaunce
Therefore his pain was made in manner double
Right as him silf was double in governance
Falls of his oath of hest and assurance
And double in menynge as he has perseuered
So in his end his members were disseuered
His fete were draw from the head asondre
There was no joint with other for to abide
Here was a leg / and an arm lay yondre
Thus each membre from other began deuyde
And for he could hold in outher side
By falls pretens to outher party true
Him to chastise was found a pain new
A Chaptre how princes should of their oaths and promises be true auoydinge
all doubleness / and decepcion
LO here the end of double falls meninge
When word and heart be contrarious
Oath and behest falls found in a king
Of albanoys as was this mecius
O noble princis prudent and virtuous
Let never story after more record
That word and deed should in you discord
For king mecius variaunt of courage
Whoos inward menynge was even on treason set
Treynes contryuynge with a fair visage
His thought his heart with double cord fret
By bochas called deceit and falls baret
Which vice descryuynge concludes of reason
Fraud of all frauds is false decepcion
For with a face flaterynge and pesible
Pretendinge troth under falls plesaunce
With his panteris perilous and terrible
Trappeth innocents with grenys of myschaunce
I mean deceit that with her countenance
Folks englueth simple and recheles
And them werreith under a face of pes
Puissaunce of princes famous and honorable
Has be deceived by this traitouresse
And folk most prudent in their estate notable
Has be distroubled by such falls doubleness
And many a knight victorious of prowess
Has been entriked for all his high renoun
By treynes found of deceit and treson
Deceyt deceyueth and shall be deceived
For by deceyt who is deceyuable
Though his deceyt be not out parceyued
To a deceyuour deceyte is retournable
Fraud quyt with eraude is guerdon couenable
For who with fraud fraudolent is found
To a defrauder fraud will ay rebounde
Of king hostilius that first weryd purpyll hew consu^pte with fuyleuene
wHat should I more of deceyte endite
Touching the fraud of king mecius
For I me cast now finally to write
The fatal end of king hostilius
Which was the first as says valerius
In rome cite that auctours knew
Among kings that weryd purpyll hew
But after all his tryumphall noblesse
And many uncouth knightly high emprise
Fortune tappalle the pris of his prowess
Made him to be in full froward wise
Recheles and slow to do sacrifise
To Iubiter for which sent from heuene
He was consumpte with sodeyn fiery leuene
Here men may se the reuolucions
Of fortunes double purueaunce
How the most mighty of romayn champions
Have suddenly be brought unto myschaunce
And their outrages to put in remembrance
Great conquest turned to woo fro joy
For a rebuke I send them this lenuoye
Lenuoye.
ROme remember of thy fundacion
And of what people thou took thy begynni^ge
Thy byldinge began of falls dissencion
Of slaughter murdre and outrayous robbinge
Yeuynge to us a manner knowlegynge
A falls beginning auctours determyne
Shall by process come unto ruin
Where be thy emperors most souereyne of renoun
Kings exyled for outrayous living
Thy senators with worthy Scip^on
Poets old thy triumphs rehersynge
Thy laureat knights most statly there riding
Is by long process brought unto ruin
Where is now Caesar that took possession
First of the empire the tryumphe vsurpinge
Or where is lucan that makes mention
Of all his conquest by cerious writynge
Octauyan most solemply regnynge
Where is bycome their lordship or their line
Process of yerys has brought it to ruin
Where is tullius cheef lantern of thy town
In rethoryke all other surmountynge
Moral Senec or prudent sad Caton
Thy common profit alwey preferringe
Or rightful traian most justly in his demynge
Which on no party lyftnat to declyne
But long process has brought all to ruin
Where is the temple of thy proteccion
Made by virgil most corious of bildinge
Images erect of every regyon
When any land was found rebellynge
Toward that part a small bell herd ryngynge
To that province the image did enclyne
Which by long process was brought to ruin
Where is also the great extorcion
Of consuleris and prefectys opprossynge
Of dictatours the false collusion
Of decemvir the froward deceyuynge
Of all echon the odious rauyne
Has by process the brought unto ruin
Where is bycome thy dominacion
Thy great trybutys thy tresours shynynge
The world all hole in thy subieccion
Thy sword of vengeance all people manacynge
Ever gredy to encrece in thy ge^ynge
^o thing by grace which that is dyuyne
Which has the brought by process to ruin
In thy most highest exaltacion
Thy proud tyrauntys prouyncis conquerynge
To god contrary by long rebellyon
Goddys goddessis falsely obeynge
Above the sic^rys by surquedous clymbynge
^yll vengeance thy noblesse did untwine
With new compleyntis to show thy ruin

(...) pompous boost thy lordshipes encresynge

(...) false goddis plainly desyenge
(...) thyn heart unto that heavenly king
Which with his blood thy sorrows for to fine
Has made thy raunson to save the fro ruin
From old saturn draw thine affeccion

Resort again with will and hole menynge
To him that is lord of the ordres nine
Which mekely dyed to save the fro ruin
Though mars be mighty in his assencion
By influence victories disposynge
And bright phoebus yeueth consolacion
To worldly princes their noblesse auaunsynge
Forsake their rightis and thy falls offrynge
And to that lord bow down thy chyne
Which shed his blood to save the fro ruin
Venged mercurye cheef lord and patron
Of eloquence and of fair spekinge
Forsake his service in thyn opinyon
And serve thy lord that governs all thing
The sterryd heuyn the speres eke meuynge
Which for thy sake was crownyd with a spyne
His heart eke perced to save the fro ruin
Castup of venus the false derision
Her fiery bronde her flateries renewynge
Of diana the transmutacion
Now bright now pale now clear now drepinge
Of blind cupide the fraudolent mockinge
Of Juno bachus proserpina Lucyne
For none but crist may save the fro ruin
Void of Cirses the bestyall poison
Of cirenes the furious chauntynge
Let not Medusa do the no treason
And fro gorgones turn thy lokynge
And let Sinderesis have the in kepinge
That crist jesus may be thy medecyne
Again such raskail to save the fro ruin
Of falls ydolis make abiuracion
To similacres do no worshippinge
Make thy resort to cristis passion
Which may by mercy redress thyn errynge
And by his grace repare thy falling
So thou obey his virtuous disciplyne
Trust that he shall restore thy ruin
His mercy is surmountynge of foyson
Ever encreceth without amenusynge
Ay at full each time and each ceson
And never waneth by none eclipsynge
When men list make devoutly their reckoning
To leave their sin and come to his doctrine
He ready is to keep them from ruin
O Rome rome all old abusion
Of Ceremonies falsely disusinge
Ley them aside and in conclusion
Cry god mercy thy trespacis repenting
Trust he wilnat refuse thy axynge
The to receive to labor in his vine
Eternally to save the from ruin
O noble princes of high discrecion
Sith in this world is none abidinge
Peyse conscience again will and reason
While ye have leyser of heart ymagenynge
Ye bear not hens but your deseruynge
Let this conceyte ay in your thoughts mine
Bexaumple of rome how all goth to ruin
Explicit liber secundus.
Sequitur prologus libri tercii
lIke a pilgryme which that goth on foot
And has none horse to releue his travail
Hot dry weary and may find no bote
Of well cold when thrust does him ^ssaile
Wine nor licour that may to him avail
Right so fare I which in my business
No socoure find my rudeness to redress
I mean as thus I have no fressh licoure
Out of the conductes of Calliope
Nor through cly^ in rethorike no flower
In my labor for to refressh me

To tame their tu^nes with some drop of plente
For polip^emus through his great blyndnesse

Our life here short of wit the great dullness

Dread and vn^u^nynge have made a strong battle

In translatynge of n^we to q^^^e me
Stories to write of old antiquite
Thus was I set and stood in double were
At the metynge of feerfull weys tweyne
The one was this who ever list to lere
Where as good will began me constreyne
Bochas taccomplisshe for to do my pain
C^m ignorance with a manace of dread
My pen to rest I durst not proceed
Thus my silf remembringe on this book
It to translate how I had undertake
Full pale of chere astonyed in my look
Mine hand began trymble my pen I felt quake
That dispeyred I had al most forsake
So great a labor dredefull and importable
It to perform I fond me so unable
Twene the residue of this great iourneye
And lityll thereof that was begu^ne
I stood chekmate for fere when I began se
In my weye how little I had ru^ne
Like to a man that failed day and su^ne
And had no light to accomplissh his viage
So far I stood abak in my passage
The night came on derkyd with ignorance
My wit was dull by cleernesse to discern
In rethorike for lack of suffisaunce
The torchis out and quenchid was the lantern
And in this cas my style to govern
Me to furthre I fond none other muse
But hard as stone p^erides and meduse
Support was none my dullness for to guye
Pouert approchyd in staall crokyd age
Mercurye absent and philologie
My purs ay light and void of all coynage
Bachus ferof to glad my courage
An ebb of plente scarcete at full
Which of an old man makes the sprite dull
And unto purpos this auctour full notable
To his scolers there being in presence
Full demurly began reherce a fable
With many a color of sugared eloquence
Thereon concludynge the su^me of his sentence
Touching a strif which he did express
Atwene glad pouert and this blind goddess
A disputacion between fortune and glad pouert.
QVod andalus whilom of fortune
In straight place there sat glad pouerte
Which resembled of look and figure
A recheles woman most ougly unto see
At a narowe metynge of hye weyes three
All to torn to raggyd and to rent
A thousand patches upon her garnement
She was hidous both of chere and face
And in semynge void of sorrow and dread
And by that wey as fortune did pace
And of glad pouert suddenly took head
She began to smyle and laughe at her in deed
By a manner scornynge in certain
Of her array she had so great disdeyne
Whoos froward laughter when pouert did espy
How she of her had indignacion
She rose her up of high malencolye
Pleynly to show her entencion
Without good day or salutacion
Doing to fortune no manner reverence
Under these words declarynge her sentence
O thou fortune most fool of folys all
What cause have thou for to laugh at me
Or what disdeyne is in thyn heart fall
Spare not adell tell on late se
For I full litell have adoo with the
Of old nor new I have none aqueyntaunce
Nouther with the nor with thy governance
And when fortune beholds the manner
Of glad pouert in her totorne wede
And kn^we also by countenance and chere
How she of her took but little head
Like as she had to her no manner need
The which things conceived and seyne
To pouert she answered thus again
My scornful laughter plainly was for the
When I the saw so megre pale and lene
Nakyd and cold in great aduersite
Scabbyd scoruy scalled and unclean
On back and body as it is well seen
Many a be walk in there pasture
Which day by day of new thou do recure
Having no thing to wrap in thy head
Save a broad hat rent out of nattys old
Full often hungry for defaute of bread
Slepynge on straw in the frostes cold
And where thou comyst as men may well behold
For feer of the children them withdraw
And many a dog has on thy staf Ignawe
To all estatys thou art most odious
Men with the will have no daliaunce
Thy felawship is so contrarious
Where thou abydest may be no plesaunce
Folk hate so dedly thy froward acquaintance
That finally I dare conclude of the
Where ever thou comyst thy felaweship men fle
When glad pouert began plainly understand
The rebukes reherced of fortune
The rude resons that she took on hand
Which frowardly to her she did entune
As pouert were a refus in comune
By the repreuys that fortune on her laid
For which pouert replied again and said
Fortune quod she touching this debate
Which of malice thou do again me take
Be well certain touching my pore estate
I of fre will thy favor have forsake
And though folk say thou may men rich make
Yet I had lever be pore with gladness
Than with trouble possede great richesse
For though thou seem benynge and debonaire
By a manner counterfete appearance
Fat and well fed with round chekys fair
With many colors of troth as in pretense
As thereof feith were very existence
But under all thy flowers of fresshnesse
The serpent glydeth of change and doubleness
And though thy clothing be of purple (...)
With great awaitynge of many chamberer^s
Of gold and perle each day chaungyd new
Clothis of gold and sundry fresshe ^tiris
And in thyn household full many officeris
Yet I dare well put in Iupartye
With the to plete and hold chaumpartye
Thus glad pouert began wexe importune
Of chere contrary of look and of language
Again this lady which called is fortune
That of dysdeyne she fill into a rage
Behold quod she of pouert the courage
In wretchidnesse stondynge disconsolate
How again me she is now obstynate
She cannat se how she stant outrayed
Fear from the favor of my felicite
Yet of pride she is not disamayed
Nor list not bow f^r to obey me
Though she be cast in mendicite
Ferthest abacke I do you well assure
In mischeef set of any creature
But truly pouert for all thy truaundyse
Maugre thy pride and thine outrage
I shall the punysshe in full cruel wise
To make the lou^e under my seruage
Which resemblest a dedely image
That were new resyn out of his grave
And yet of pride dar^st again me rave
But when fortune had these words said
Glad pouert began fall in great gladness
And ageyn fortune with a so deyne brayde
She began her conceit out she wed and express
Fortune quod she though thou be a goddess
Called of folys yet learn this of me
From thy ^eruage I stand at liberte
But if I shall algatis have adoo
With the in armies most (...) and vengeable
Touching the quarrel that is (...) us two
There is one thing (...) right confortable
That thy courage (...) and unstable
And where an heart (...) divided
Victory in (...) provided
My lyf^ nouther (...)
Nor the (...)
Though (...) langag^
Appropryd be to (...)
And in despite of thy presumpcion
I have forsake of my fre volume
All the tresours of worldly vanite
Whilom I was as thou have devised
Servant to the and unto thy tresours
But from thy danger now that I am fraunchised
Seeking of the nouther of help nor socoures
Manace kings and mighty emperors
For glad pouert late nouther sone
With thy riches has no thing to done
For though thou have enbraced in thy cheyne
Worldly princes and goods transitories
And rich merchants under thy demeyne
Yeuyst to knighthode conquest and victories
The fadinge pali^e of laud and veynglories
But when echone thy favor have recured
Than is glad pouert fre fro thy lure assured
Al thy servants stand under dread
Quakinge for fere of thy doubleness
For nouther wisdom force nor manhede
Fredam bounte lone nor gentylnesse
May in thy favor have no sekernesse
They be so possyd with wyndes in thy barge
Where as glad pouert goth freely at his large
Thy manasynge does me no duresse
Which worldly princes dreden euerychon
They may well quake for loss of great richesse
But I glad pouert thereof desire none
As flow and ebb all worldly thing must gone
For after flodys of fortunes tide
The ebb flows and will no man obyde
Flow and ebb to me both alych
I dread no thing thy mutabilite
Make whom thou list outher pore or rich
For I no thing will requere of the
Nouther lordship nor great prosperity
For with thy giftys who that has to done
Of chaungys braydeth ofter than the moon
Out of pouert came first these emperors
That were in rome crownyd with laurere
Fredam and largess made them f^^st victour^
Causinge (...) ^ame to shine bright and clear
Ty^^ couetise brought them in daungere
When they of folly in their most excellence
To thy doubleness did reverence
For when fredam a prince does forsake
And couetise put away largess
And streytnesse into household take
And nygardship exileth gentylnesse
Than is withdraw from their hye noblesse
The peples heart and plainly to deuyse
Of their seruauntis far well all good seruise
All such sodeyne chaungis in comune
In this world vsyd now fro day to day
Echon they come by fraud of falls fortune
Experience has put at assay
Love / troth / and feyth be gone far away
And if that trust with princes will not tarry
Lit^ll merueyle though the people very
For through thy chaungis of fraudolent fairness
There is now used in every region
Glad chere out showed with covert doubleness
Under the courteyn of simulacion
So feere is now adulacion
That in this world may be no surete
But if it rest in glad pouerte
Yet of thy perilous froward variaunce
I set no store truly as form
For all thy friendship concludes with myschaunce
With sodeyn mischeef of mutabilite
Which yeueth me heart to have adoo with the
For suffisaunce in my pore estate
Shall to thy chaungys sey suddenly chekmate
Fortune with anger almoost dispeyred
Of these words took full great greuaunce
Pouert quod she which may not be apeyred
But I now show again the my puissaunce
Men would little accoumte my substance
O mighty pouert o strong hercules
Which again me puttyst thy silf in prees
Supposyst thou it should the avail
Outher by force or by hardynesse
To have adoo with me in bataile
Which am of conquest and of high prowess
In armies called lady and princes
For there is none so mighty conqueror
That may prevail without my favor
Of these words pouert no thing afferde
Answered ageyn thus plainly in sentence
Though I here have spear shield nor sword
Nor choson armor to stand at diffence
Pollex nor dagger to make resistance
But bare and naked anon it shall be seyne
Where thou with me dare wras^le on this plain
Which shall be done under condi^on
That none of us shall him silf withdraw
But still abide of entencion
Till he that venquessheth ordained has a law
Such as him lyketh again his felawe
The which law shall not be delayed
To be accomplisshed on him that is outraied
Of whose words fortune again began smyle
That pouert profred so proudly to assail
And upon this she stint a little while
And to pouert she put this opposayle
Who shall quod she be urge of this bataile
Or give dome justly atwene us tweyne
Of this quarrel which we shall dareyne
I ask also another question
Touching thy profre of furious outrage
Where as thou putest a condition
And a law with full proud langage
Where shall thou find pledgys or hostage
To keep the promys which thou doste ordeyne
Thereof to abide the guerdon or the pain
I mean as thus if there be set alawe
Atwene us two or a condition
^y suerte which may not be withdraw
As under bond or obligacion
But there is nouther law no reason
May bind a beggar if it be well sought
When it is preuyd that he has rightnought
The sect of pouert has a protection
From all statutes to go at lyberte
And from all law a plain exepcion
Than follows it if thou bind the
To any law that may contryued be
It were fraunde pleynly to endyte
Which have rightnought thy perty to aquyte
Thou art so feeble if I came thereto
That thou were brought unto (...)
For no power when all that were (...)
Thou should fail to make thy fynaunce
Both destitute of good and of substance
And since no law now thy person (...)
It were folly with such one to Iupa^^^
If I would compulse the to wrake
To axe of the tresoure of king darye
On that party thou stondest far abak
My payment so long should tarry
Indigence would the to varye
And if I would thy person eke compare
To alisaundre thy sides been full bare
And finally thou stondest in such caas
Of myserye wretchidnesse and need
That thou myghtest of reason singe alas
Both forsake of friendship and kinrede
And there is none dare pledge the for dread
Yet like a fool supprised with vaynglorye
Hopyst of me to win the victory
QVod glad pouert I doubt neueradell
That the victory shall pas on my side
Pledge and hostages let them goo farewell
I axe no more of all thy great pride
But to the end that thou will abide
Pledge thy feyth albe that some men seyth
To trust in fortune there is full lityll feyth
And for my part in this high emprise
Sith I have pledges nouther one nor two
More sure hostage can I not devise
But if so be the victory thou atteyne
Than yield my body bound in a cheyne
Perpetuelly like the condition
With the to abide fetred in prison
Than fortune lough more than she did aforne
When she saw pouert so presumptuous
In his array all to raggyd and to torn
And had nouther rent land nor house
It is quod she a thing contratious
Unto nature who that can aduert
To a beggar to have a sturdy heart
And if I the venquesshed in battle
It were to me no worship nor auau^tage
What should thy body unto me avail
The to enprison streytly in a cage
It should be a charge and a costage
Thyn empty womb each day to fulfill
If thou might have vitayle at thy will
And if I would my silf to magnefie
Tokyn of tryumphe after my chare to lead
Men would deem it a manner mokerye
And say in scorn take of that fool good head
How he a beggar has overcome in deed
Faught with him for to encrece his name
Which conquest turns to his disclaundre and shame
Yet when I have brought the to vttraunce
My power shadowed and my great might
And thin outrage oppressed by vengeance
After all this as it is skyll and right
It shall be couth in every mannys sight
Out declared the great difference
Atwene thy feblenesse and my great excellence
Than to repress thy surquedye atones
Cruel Orchus the tydogge infernal
Shall rende thy skyn asondre from the bonys
To show my power which is imperial
And to declare in especall
Pouert recleymed unto pridis lure
With me to plete may no while endure
And suddenly or glad pouert took head
Fortune proudly first began tassayle
And unwarily hent her by the head
Demynge of pride that she may not fail
Through her power to venquessh this battle
But it may fall a drewry in his right
To outraye a geaunt for all his great might
God takes none head to power nor to strength
To high estate nor to high noblesse
To square lymmes forged on bread or length
But to quarrels groundyd on rightwisnesse
For out of wrong may grow no prowess
For where that troth holdyth champartye
God will his cause by grace magnyfie
Wherefore pouert strong in her intent
Light and deliver void of all fatness
Right well brethed and nothing corpulent
Small of dietie surfetis to repress
Again fortune proudly began her dress
And with an ougly stern crull face
Began in armies her proudly to enbrace
Pouert was slendre and might well endure
Fortune was round short of wind and breath
And wombes great oppressed with armure
For lack of wind the great stuf them slethe
And many a man brings to his death
For ouermoch of any manner thing
Has many one brought to his undoing
Amene is best with good governance
Tomoch is naught nor over great plente
Gretter richesse is found in suffisaunce
Than in the flodys of superfluyte
And who is content in his pouerte
And grutchith not for bitter nor for sote
What ever he be has fortune under foot
Couetise put him in no dispeire
Wherefore pouert in heart glad and light
L^st fortune full high up in the air
And her constreyned of very force and might
For glad pouert of custom and of right
When any trouble again her does begin
Ay of fortune the laurer she does win
Maugre fortune in the eire alofte
Constreyned she was by wylfull pouerte
That to the earth her fall was full vnsoft
For of pouert the bony sharp kne
Slendre and long and lene upon to se
Hit fortune with so great a might
Again the heart she mightnat stand upright
To signefie that pouert with gladness
Which is content with small possession
And grueth no force of tresoure nor richesse
Has over fortune the dominacion
And keeps her ever under subieccion
Where worldly folk with their rich apparaile
Live ever in dread fortune would fail
The poor man before the thief does sing
Under the wodes with fressh notys shyll
The rich man full feerfull of robbinge
Ou^ king for dred rides forth full still
The pore a^ large goth where him list at will
Strongly fraunchised from all debate and strif
The rich aferde alwey to lose his lif
Thus glad pouert has the palm I won
Fortune outrayed for all her doubleness
Upon whom pouert in have is run
And streyned her with so great duresse
Till she confessed and plainly did express
With feith and handem all her great pain
To abide what law pouert list ordeyne
Andiin have after this disconfiture
Fortune began to complain sore
But glad pouert which all thing might endure
Charged fortune scorn her no more
For it was said since goo full yore
He that reioyseth to scorn folk in vein
When he is lothest shall scorned be again
Yet quod pouert though thou were despitous
Words rehersynge which were not fair
Strange rebukes full contrarious
And repreuys many thousend pair
Thou shall me find ageynwarde debonayre
For though a tongue be slaundrous and vengeable
To slaundre again is no thing comendable
Thou must concidre touching our battle
The ordinance and imposicion
That which of us in conquest do prevail
To bring his felawe to subjection
He shall obey the statute of reason
And accomplissh of very due det
What law the victour list upon him set
For which thou shall the said law obey
With circumstauncis of the condition
By me ordained and no thing again seye
Make no grutchinge nor replicacion
Concidred first the false opinyon
Of them that seyn all worldly adventure
Of good and bad abide under thy cure
Su^me poets and philosophers also
Would in this cas make the a gods
Which be deceived I dare say both two
And their error and folly to redres
I shall withdraw in very sekyrnes
Unhappy adventure awey fro thy power
That she no more stand in thy duunger
This law of new upon the I make
That first thou shall al open in so^me pleyn
Evil adventure bind to a stake
Or to sum pelere where she may be seyn
To show exaumple to folk in certain
That noman shall lose her ne discharg^
But such as list with her to go at large
Hereof to make a declaracion
Touching thy might of evil adventure
Thou shall forgo thy domynacion
To hindre and harm any creature
But only folys which in thy might assure
They of their folly may feel great damage
Not of thy power but of thyn own outrage
For thilke foolys which that list unbind
This wretch called unhappy adventure
Of wit and reason they make them silf blind
Like as the world stood in fortunys cure
As though she might assure them and unsure
And them dispose to wealth or wretchidnesse
In their error her calling a goddess
Such wilful wretchis that them silf betake
To put their fredom in her subjection
Of god above the power they forsake
And submit them again all reason
Under fortunes transmutacion
Their liberte full falsely for to thrall
Namely when they a goddess list her call
With a dirke mist of variacion
Fortune has clouded their clear natural light
And ouershadowed their discrecion
That they be blent in their inward sight
For to considre and behold aright
How god above put under mannys cure
Fre chois of good his reason to assure
The lord enlumyned of his bountuous largess
With mind and wit his memorial
Toward all virtue his steppis for to dress
Endued his reason for to be natural
Of frowardness till he wax bestyall
To bind him silf contrariously in deed
To serve fortune atwene hope and dread
Thus bestyall folk made her a gods
Falsely wenynge she might them most avail
With her plentees of habundaunt richesse
And su^me deem in their supposayle
With unware change she dare the great assail
Whoos trust always medlyd is with trouble
And her plesaunce includith menynge double
And su^me afferme that she may auaunce
Conquestis great and disconfitures
And how it lith also in her puissaunce
To forther and hindre al manner creatures
And call her princess of al auentures
The rich to enhaunce by roial apparayle
And by disdeyne to hindre the porayle
When she makes most fulsum her profres
Her blaundisshinge is farcyd with falshede
When her richessis been stuffed up in coffres
They been ay shet under a lock of dread
Wherefore ye rich of one thing take heed
As your gadrynge came in with plesaunce
Right so your loss departith with myschaunce
Your gredy thurst tresoure to multiplye
Causith an etike of non^suffisaunce
In you engendrynge a falls Idropsye
With a sharp hungre of worldly habundaunce
Making of you a manner resemblaunce
With tantalus when ye do deppest synke
Than is your nature most thrustleugh to drink
Who clymbeth highest on fortunes whele
And suddenly to richessis does ascend
An unware turn before seen neueradell
When he leest weneth makes him descend
Fro such chaungys who may him silf defend
But they that be with pouert not dismayde
And can with litell hold them silf appayde
How king hostilius worshippynge falls goddys was consumpte with fiery leuene
ANd while bochas began muse in this matere
Considred first all worldly thing must fail
With weeping ^yen there did appear
Princis that whilom were famous in Itayle
Which began there fall full pitously bewail
For more contrary was their fallinge low
That they tofore had no myscheef know
For more uncouth is thilke aduersite
Namely to princes when it is sodeyn
Which ever have lived in prosperity
Having on fortune no matter to complain
Than of a wretch that lives ay in pain
Of custum causes conceived the sentence
Of Joy and sorrow a full great difference
Of Joy passyd the new remembrance
When folk been fall from their felilicite
In treble wise it does them great greuaunce
The unware turn from their tranquilite
The unsure trust and mutabilite
In worldly power which that they have found
Unto their hertis yeueth a grievous wound
But a wretch which in wretchidnesse
Has ever lived and never was partable
Of no welfare nor of wylfulnesse
Nor never found fortune favorable
His sorrow his myscheef been so customable
That of his pains long contynuance
Does to his greuys a manner allegaunce
But to princes which sat so high aloft
A sodeyne fall is most contrarious
And their descendynge well the more vnsoft
In their tryumphes that thy were glorious
Record I take of king hostilius
Which in rome from his royal stall
When he sat crowned most suddenly is fall
It is remembered of old and not of new
Of all rome that he was lord and sire
The first of kings that weryd purpyl hew
And of that cite governed the empire
Had of fortune all that him list desire
Till that he fill in all his regalye
Into a froward dedly maladye
And of his pains to find allegaunce
To the temples he went on pilgrimage
His offringe made with devout obeysaunce
Whereby sumdell his pains did aswage
And he was restoryd of courage
Felt him silf that he did amend
To common profit ageyn he began entende
Upon Talbanys regnynge in his glory
To great avail of rome the cite
Through his knighthode he had a great victory
After the which by full great cruelte
He beraft them fraunchise and lyberte
And made them after through his high renoun
To be to rome under subjection
After his conquest the story does deuyse
In his noblesse full statly and royal
He began make a rich sacrifise
To queme and please for a memorial
After the rightes Cerymonyall
To Iubiter by full great reverence
Before his auters with fires and encence
But for that he in his inward intent
By circumstaunces of his oblacion
Was recheles found and also neglygent
By some froward falls affeccion
The goddys caught an indignacion
And suddenly descendynge from the heuene
He was consumpte with a fiery leuene
His false goddys might him not avail
Jupiter Saturnus nor venus
Let all christian defye such rascaile
For to our feith they be contrarious
And among goddys a thing most outraious
Is when that princes blent in their folly
List erthly things falsely deifie
For unto god is hateful and odible
A withdrawynge of his reverence
To magnifye things corruptible
With undue honor with falls concupiscence
Wherefore ye princes be ware of high prudence
Lest god unwarily punyssh your noblesse
Make you in earth no falls god nor goddess
How anchus king of rome was murdrid by Lucynyo by thassent of his wif
Think on achus king of rome town
Which was so noble shyninge in his glory
Weryd a crown full famous of renoun
Next hostilius as put is in memory
Wan the palm of many great victory
But for all that with a full sharp knyfe
He murdered was by assentinge of his wife
He loved her best above each creature
Considred not her flatere nor falsnesse
Her double menynge under couerture
Falsely blent this princis worthynesse
To rob and reave him of his great richesse
Was her labor with counterfete plesaunce
In her intent to bring him to myschaunce
This anchus had a great affeccion
Unto his goddis to make sacrifises
And to augment the relegion
Of paganysme made in sundry wises
Through his manhood and circumspect diuises
Upon Latynes rebel to his cite
For common profit he made a great arm
One of their citees called polotone
He knightly wan maugre al their might
And when he had of them full victory
He abode no lengre but anon forth right
Made all the people in every mannys sight
As prisoners this romayn champion
Brought before him bound into the town
Eke as I find this anchus nolde cece
For common profit in his affeccion
Their teritories to augment and encrece
In all the cuntrees about enuyron
Toward the ryuere where tybre renneth
At the which place he let edify
A full strong cite which called is ostye
But not withstanding all his worthynesse
He was depryued the story tells so
Of his kingdom and his great richesse
By a foreyne called Lucynyo
His wife tarquild assented was thereto
By whoos outrage and gredy couetise
Anchus was murdered in full cruel wise
How Lucynyo that murdered anchus was after murdered
tHus fro the whele of fortune he is fall
Lucynyo in rome is crowned king
And the romans after did him call
Tarquyn the old by record of writynge
Which has ateyned by fraudolent werkynge
And by his subtle forgyd eloquence
Unto thestate of royal excellence
He first ordained in his estate royal
Turneis iustes in castellys and citees
And other plays called marciall
With many famous great solempnytees
Sessions for statys and degrees
This tarquyn eke was first that did his pain
In opyn stretys tauernes to ordeyne
Eke to preserve his cite out of doubt
If their enemies list them to assail
He was the first that walled rome about
With mighty toures vnlykly for to fail
And had also many strong battle
With Sabynes in their rebellyon
And made them subget unto rome town
But for he was assented to depryue
Worthy anchus from his estate royal
And after that took tanquyld unto wyue
Which slough her lord by treason full mortal
God would of right that he should have a fall
The lord will not which every thing may see
Suffer murdre long to be secre
For Lucynyo for his great offense
Touching the murdre of king anchus
Islayne was by sodeyn vyolence
Of two shipperdys the story tells thus
Which of intent were contrarious
Atwene them silf by a feigned strif
To find a weye to reave him of his life
For while the king sat in judgment
Upon their quarrel for to do iustise
Full suddenly they being of assent
Fill upon him in full cruel wise
And with an axe the story does devise
One of them or any man took head
On two pertyes roof the kings head
This thing was done by the procuring
Of two children sons to anchus
Which were exiled by false compassinge
Of lucynyo again them most yrous
To him their presence was so odious
But they them shope though they were out of sight
Their faders death to avenge if they myyht
For of nature blood will auengyd be
To recompense the wrong of his kinrede
In this chaptre like as ye may se
Blood shed for blood thus both did blede
By which example let princes take heed
How murdre done for supplantacion
Requires vengeance for his fynall guyrdon
Lenuoye
THis tragedy by clear inspeccion
Openly declares in substance
How slaughter of princes causes subucion
Of realmys cytees put out of ordenaunce
Of mortal werre long contynuaunce
Blood by supplantynge shed of kings tweyne
By exaumple here showed falls murdre to restreyne
The fine declarynge of murdre and falls treson
The deed horrible cries ay vengeance
To god above to cast his ^yen down
To punyssh this sin through his mighty puissau^ce
For it is modre of myscheef and myschaunce
Wherefore ye princys do sum law ordeyne
Within your bou^dis three vices to restreyne
The vice of sclaundre murdre and poison
Where ever these three have aqueyntaunce
They bring in sorrow and desolacion
Put at a preef by new remembrance
Of falshede used under fair countenance
Wherefore ye princes do your besy pain
Within your boundys these vices to restreyne
God defend this noble region
With these three vices to have allyaunce
For sleaundre first deuoureth high renoun
And sleeth good fame throug falls dalliaunce
Harm done to late follows repentance
Wherefore ye princes do a law ordeyne
To punyssh their malice falls tunges to restreyne
God has of murdre abhominacion
And falls poison does to him displesaunce
There is no pain in comparison
Condign to murdre peysyd in balaunce
Wherefore ye princes make an ordenaunce
Within your bounds of some preuy pain
By due punysshinge falls murdre to restreyne
O noble princes provide of reason
Again these vices to make purueaunce
Of rigor show due execucion
With your labor and hertely instaunce
Let death be guerdon for their fynall penance
To warn all other by constreynt of their pain
From these three vices their corages to restreyne
How for the offense done to Lucrece by Tarquyn was never after crowned king
in rome
tOuching this tarquyn of who^ I now told
As mine auctor makes mention
He called was Tarquinius the old
Which long in rome had dominacion
Till his kinrede and generation
For the offense done unto Lucrece
Caused the kings the names to cece
For his son which after did succeed
For his outrages and his extorcions
And for many an other cruel deed
For his hateful vsurpacions
His froward life and falls conditions
Among the people both still and loud
He called was tarquinius the proud
Full obstynat he was in his intent
Ambicious taccroche great richesse
Till that fortune wexed impacient
Ageyns him in all his great noblesse
Began her snaris and her crokys dress
Thought she would but he kept him well
All suddenly cast him from her whele
A son he had full vicious as I find
To all virtue most contrarious
To be froward it came to him by kind
And of nature proud and despitous
Again the people fell and malicious
Not loved but dread for tyranny of right
Is thing most hatyd in the people sight
This proud Tarquyn the story is well couth
Ageyn Lucrece did a great outrage
Oppressed her beutye in his vnbridelyd youth
His troth assailinge in a furious rage
For which his fadre and his lynage
Exilyd were and for this hateful thing
There was neuyr after in rome crowned king
Her body corrupt she clean of heart and thought
By force assailed was her Innocence
Oppressed her beutye but her spryte naught
Her chaste will did none offense
But entryd is into her conscience
A great remors for all her wifly truth
To sle her silf which was to great a ruthe
And for that bochas remembers pitously
Her dedly sorrow and lamentacion
Write her compleynt in order ceriously
Which that she made for her oppression
I follow must and make mention
After mine auctour percell rehersynge
Touching her words said in her dyinge
All be it so by biddynge of my lord
Rehercyd have in my tra^slacion
After Pierms here and there a word
Of a full doolfull declamacion
By him remembered of entencion
For her sake men might se and read
What wifly troth was in her womanhede
And John bochas list not set aside
But that he would reherce in sentence
Her woeful compleynt and thereupon abide
Of wrongs done to her Innocence
And though I can not follow his eloquence
I shall sue the troth of rehersynge
As in substance theffect of his wrytinge
THe morrow next after this foul deed
Lucrece vproos with a full dedly chere
Out of her face gone was all the read
And dirked were her heavenly iyen clear
All clad in black after the manner
Of thilke folk which in especial
Be wont to goo to festys funeral
All her friends being in presence
Husbonde fader with other eke also
By and by rehersynge in sentence
The circumstaunces of hirtely woo
And or that I any forther goo
Under hope my lord will me supporte
What that she said I will to you report
The grievous compleynt of Lucrece upon her oppression
FOr as much quod she as I Lucrece
Am by the law Joined in marriage
To the my lord whoos love shall ay encrece
Toward the with all the surplusage
Of wifely troth to endure all mine age
As humble subget with faithful obeysaunce
Under thy lordship and thy governance
O Collatyn my lord and true husbonde
Best beloved of hole affeccion
I will no more no quarrel take on hand
Nor in no wise take none accion
Without that thou list enclyne down
Goodly thyn erys to give me audience
To that I shall reherce in thy presence
Injury done or any manner wrong
Again my worship or mine honest
By the law my sentence is made strong
It touches you also well as me
I am so holy yoldyn unto the
Thou art mine head who clearly can discern
Lord and husbonde my body to govern
Parciall causes in soth there may none be
Atwene us twain nor none disseueraunce
For sote and bitter joy and aduersite
We must them wey both in one balaunce
Counterpeyse our sorrows our plesaunce
Entermedle all thing that stant in doubt
Receive our fortune as it comes about
There may atwene us be no menynge double
But one heart one will and one courage
And as woman that stondyth now in trouble
Without polisshinge of any fair langage
I must disclose to you the great outrage
Done unto me and plainly it discure
Which to redress lith holy in your cure
For the matter to speak in words plain
A right out serched and the troth out found
As a just cause vndifferent to tweyne
Toward us both the quarrel does rebounde
And more strongly our matter for to ground
Reherce I will so that ye sauf it vouch
A mortal wrong which the and me does touch
In a castle which called is Collace
Of which my lord here has the governance
Tarquyn the young came into that place
I full disware to make purueaunce
Again his coming or any ordenaunce
Tofore not warnyd of his officers
Sat unpurveyed among my chamberers
Of intent to eschew Idylnesse
We sat and span wollys soft
For she of vices is a cheef maistres
Where she is cherisshed and I set aloft
But of custom as I have done full often
I and my wymen duly as we ought
To avoid sloth full besyly wrought
His entering was meke and debonayre
Benygne of port of look and of visage
With a precence of many wordys fair
In whoos menynge was full great outrage
His chere contraire unto his courage
In this wise ^here ^e was receyuyd
Whereby alas I falsely was deceived
At pryuie face as me thought it due
I him received at his in coming
^oos up mek^ly and began him to salve
As apperteyned in all manner thing
Unto the son of a worthy king
And truly tarquyn for which I say alas
Me to be ^^aisshe stood in the same caas
A kings son should of duty
(...) to wyme^ wall and proteccion
Prese^^e and keep them in all suerte
That no man should of no presumpcion
Do them no wrong nor oppression
^a^he^ dye than se them suffer unright
^uer^singe the office of a knight
(...) contrary of knighthode he has wrought
By falls outrage done ageyns me
Wrong weyes and crokyd menys sought
Of laws tweyne to break the liberte
And difface the auctorite
Of law Civil and natural also
In my person offendynge both to
First by his subtle compassinge
He began espy theserys of the place
And when abed alone I lay slepinge
Like a lion full stern of look and face
With his left hand my throat he did enbrace
And in his other held again all law
Me to oppress a nakyd sword I draw
Thus afforsynge my wifly chastity
Again knighthode he did this great offeence
My life my worship put in perplexite
Having no might to make resistance
Me manasynge by dedly violence
The tone of tweyne to dye in his intent
Or to auoutrye falsely to consent
Thus I stood sool atwene death and dyffame
My body corrupt my sprite abode clean
My spousaile brokyn and my good name
For ever disclaundryd that whilom shone full shene
Evil fame of custom will alwey wax grene
Never dye the people so them disporte
The worst of things gladly to report
Alas alas among my sorrows all
This one ^ the most that does my heart agrise
I am not worthy that men me should call
Or have the name in no manner wise
For the offense which ye have herd divise
To be called in this wretchid life
Of Collatyn fromhens forth the wife
Mine iyen also be blindyd with dirkenesse
Only for shame to liftup their sight
Outher their stremys or bemys up dress
Of the clear heuene to look upon the light
Nor I may never be of the noumbre of right
Of true matrones among them far or nere
For to be rekened in their kalendere
Let mine Iniurye and this mortal crime
Be so punysshed of right and equite
Without delay of any longer time
That ever after it may exaumple be
Through all the world and eke in this cite
With such a pain thereupon divised
That all auoutours may be thereby chastised
And if it seem in your opinyon
In this caas I should be vnpure
I will receive just punycion
And the pain patiently endure
If it so stand that perauenture
Ye deem of reason that be so just and stable
In this matter that I be culpable
Her tale told when they long had mused
On this complaynt in their inward sight
Of troth echon they held her full excused
Made albeheft with all their full might
To avenge her wrong and lucrece anon right
Took a sharp knif or they might aduerte
And roue her silf euene through the heart
The compleynt of Bochas upon the luxurye of princes as by exaumples of many
diverse myschau^cys
bOchas in heart brennynge hot as fire
Of very Ire and indignacion
Again tho princes which in their desire
Have fully set their delectacion
Their felicite and their affeccion
To follow their lustys of falls lecherye
Froward spousebrech and of auoutrye
He writes again that seeks occasions
Places of lusts to have their libertees
For to fulfill their delectacions
And for to accomplissh their great dishonestees
Devise out tauernes in borowes and citees
And sittynge there among their cumpanye
After the deed they boost of their felye
If any man pyntche at their outrage
Or them rebuke for their transgressions
They will answer with froward falls langage
And for their party allege great resons
First how it longith to their conditions
By right of nature as it is well couth
Freely to use lechery in youth
Afferme also how law of kind is fre
And so afforce them to sustene their party
By exaumple of dauyd which that took barsabe
And for her sake how he slough vrye
Deed manslaughter and falls auoutrye
For them alledgynge again right and reason
For dalida the luxury of sampson
The storye also they frowardly apply
How for a woman prudent Salamon
The lord offendynge did Idolatry
And in difference of their opinion
Reherce these stories for their exc^sacion
Of their error thereby a price to win
As tofore god lecherye were no sin
They not considre in their entencion
Of these stories of every circumstaunce
First of king dauyd the great contricion
Nor upon sampson how god took vengeance
First how he lost his force and his puissaunce
For his offense they have not this in mind
Nor how both his ^yen were made blind
Nor their resons they list not to enclyne
For to conceive in their discrecion
The spryte of wisdom heavenly and dy^eyne
Was take awey fro prudent Salamon
In chastisynge for his trangression
And some doctors a^^erme ouermore
How salamon repentyd him full sore
The play of youth folk called lecherye
Sey it is a game of nature
And to sustain and bereup their party
How it sit well by record of scripture
Unto every lively creature
That stant in health and in coraious
Of very kind to be lecherous
Vicious report they have in remembrance
But virtuous thing is far out of mind
Flesshly lusts and lecherous plesaunce
In their desires be not left behind
Auauntynge lyenge they can of new out find
And now a days they hold it curtesye
Othys horrible flateringe and rebaudye
In their auyce they take lityll head
Unto the doctrine of noble Scipion
Which commaundyd in story as I read
To Masmysma full famous of renoun
Not to touch by no condition
Sophonisba fairest of visage
But it were by wey of marriage
Though she were borne of the blood royal
Her youth was set to all honest
Daughter and heir to noble hastruball
Duke of cartage the story ye may se
And for her virtues of scinenyte
She weddyd was of birth as she was like
To king Siphax which reigned in affrike
And for to preue the great liberte
Which is in virtue conveyed by reason
And the false thraldom of dishoneste
Of both to make a plain comparison
After the doctrine of Censoryn Caton
Showed by him to folks in comune
That virtue never is subget to fortune
Virtue conserueth mesure and reason
Considers things before or they befall
Takes none emprises but of discrecion
And on prudence foundeth her works all
Ay to her counseyle attemperaunce she does ca^^
Warly prouydinge in her silf withinne
The end of things tofore or she begin
This was the doctrine taught forth of caton
Lecherous lustys to put them under fore
Granting to virtue the domynacyon
^luk^p vices branch crop and rote
Fruit of goodness grows up so sote
When it is plantyd of youth in courage
It never app^lleth in health of his tarage
Caton of virtue was a cheef officer
Preferringe ^uer common commoditees
Tofore prophets that were singular
To enhaunce the common in kingdoms and citees
Their wits peysed and their habilitees
Persons promotynge in whom it was supposed
That they in virtue were naturally disposed
Manly in heart he was ay to sustene
Indifferent troth and all iustise
Flesshly delytes of folk that were unclean
He was ay ready by rigor to chastise
And set laws in full prudent wise
For to punyssh flaterers and lechours
And such as were open auoutors
He had of wymen none opinyon
With them to dele for lust nor for bewte
But if it were for procreacion
So stable he was found in his degree
The book redynge of Immortalite
Which plato made the troth well out sought
Therein concludynge how souls dye naught
But lives ever in joy or pain
Thus wrote plato in his oryginall
Men may the body by death full well constreyne
But the soul ay abides immortal
For which this Caton steadfast as a wall
For common profit to dye was not aferde
When he him silfe slew with a nakyd sword
But to fortune before his death he said
O thou princess of worldly gods vein
To thy flaterers I never did abrayde
Thy favor is so falls and uncertain
That never I faught no fraunchise to atteyne
As for my silf no parciall singulerte
But all for profit touching the como^te
Again cesat I made resistance
To conquer fredom to me and to the town
Freely to eschew his mortal violence
This world despisynge in mine opinyon
Our fraunchyse thrallyd under subjection
Justly forsakynge the variaunce of this life
My soul conveyed to be contemplatife
This philosophre this prudent old Caton
Tendringe in heart comou^ comeditees
Tofore his death wrote of compassion
To them that sat in royal dignitees
Which had of virtue lost the lybertees
Princes besechinge that were luxurious
To take exaumple and follow king Drusus
The which drusus by succession
Heir to augustus was next him emperor
Set all in virtue his affeccion
And it to cherissh did holy his labor
To lust unlawful he never gave favor
And touching love duringe all his lif
He never had lust but oonly to his wife
And in his paleys amyd of his royal see
Of noble princes dwelling in rome town
He axed was for all his dignite
What manner courage of temptacyon
Or what feruence or delectacion
Within him silf he had of louys play
Sool by his wife when he a bed lay
And like a prince fulfilled of high noblesse
Answered again with sobre countenance
Touching such lust as follows flesshlynesse
Like as nature me put in governance
In one alone is set all my plesaunce
For with none other for no concupiscence
Save with my wife I never did offense
Princes echon follow not the traas
Of noble drusus as ye shall understand
For su^me have stand all in a another caas
Such as can hold two or three in hand
Now here now there as botys come to land
Not considringe their crees nor disauayle
When new fangylnesse blows in their sail
Eke bochas writes su^me princes have be bound
Which viciously have done their besy pain
Virtuous wymen by flatery to confound
And tender maidens to bring in a train
Such manacis and tormentys to ordeyne
Them to transfourme from their perseueraunce
And interrupte their virginal constaunce
But of such folk that give no force of shame
Nor dread god such treynes to devise
Husbondmen forsooth ar most to blame
With foreyne wymen to trespace in such wise
I trow their wives them may enough suffice
For many be feeble their dettys for to quyte
Though they in change them silf falsely delight
Su^me afferme for them silf alledgynge
To such outrage that they have license
Freely of nature to use their own thing
And in such cas to no wight do offense
But froward is their error in sentence
Fro bond of wedlok when they be so unstable
And tofore god most hateful and dampnable
For she that is trhough her high noblesse
Named of clerks which clearly can concern
Daughter of god lady and princess
Reason called to guide folk and govern
Atwene good and evil justly to discern
She has departed pleynly to conclude
The life of man from life of bestis rude
This lady reason since go full yore
Gave unto man wit and discrecion
Taught him also by her souereyne lore
Twene vi^e and virtue a great division
And he should in his eleccion
Unto a^ virtue naturally obey
And in contrary all vicious lif werrey
And to enprinte in his memorial
How of luxure the great dishoneste
Disfourme a man and make him bestyall
And disfigure of what estate he be
For when that reason of high or low degree
Is fled awey folk may afferme than
He is like a best rather than a man
Wherefore let princes that have been defectyfe
To follow their lusts of censualite
Shape them by reason for to amend their life
And to conserve and keep their chastity
Both of virgyns and wifly honest
And to punyssh all tho that list labor
The honest fame of wymen to devour
For when a lechoure by force or by^maistrye
Defouled has of virgynes the clennesse
Widows opprossed and by auoutrye
Assailed wives that stood in stablenesse
Who may than their sclaundrous harm redress
When their good name is hurt by such report
For fame lost ones can never have his resort
A thief may rob a man of his richesse
And by some mean make restitucion
And sum man may disherite and oppress
A poor man from his possession
And after make satysfaccion
But no man may restore in no degree
Amayden robbyd of her virginite
A man may also bear a castle down
And bylde it after more fresshly to the sight
Exile a man out of a region
And him revoke where it be wrong or right
But no man has the power nor the might
For to restore the paleys virgynall
Of chastity when broken is the wall
Men may also put out of seruise
And officers remeue from their place
And at a day when fortune list divise
They may again restoryd be to grace
But there is nouther time set nor space
Nor neuir in story nouther read nor seyne
That maydenhede lost recured was again
For which men should have a conscience
Rewe in their heart and repent sore
And have remors in their great offense
To rauyssh thing which they may na restore
For it is said and has been said full yore
The Emeraude grene of perfight chastity
Stolen onys away may not recured be
And hard it is to rauysshe a tresoure
Which of nature is not recuperable
Lordshyp may not of king nor emperor
Refourme a thing which is not refourmable
Rust of diffame which is not inseparable
And maydenhede lost of new or yore
No man alive may it again ros^ore
Romans old through their patience
Suffered tirauntys in their tyrannyes
And in their cite to do great violence
The people to oppress with their robberies
But to punyssh they set streyte espyes
On falls ^^^utours as it is well couth
Wydowes to rauysshe and maidens in there youth
Upon this matter the story bears witness
Touching thexil of king tarquinius
Before rehercyd by wrytinge full express
The hateful death of apius ^laudius
For his trespass done to virgineus
The iugementys rehercyd and the pain
And fro the office depryued both tweyne
Was not the cite whilom desolat
Of Synachites for their ribaudye
Of one sichen which began a great debate
To heue accomplisshed his foul lecherye
When young dyna as books specify
Went rechelesly walking up and down
To se the maidens of that royal town
But when Sychen this dyna did espy
Sool by her silf walk in the cite
^e began anon assail her by maystrye
And for to aforce her virgynyte
Because she had no leyser for to flee
Whoos great offense and transgression
The cite brought unto distruccion
Her fader Jacob and holy her kinrede
Again this Sichen began inwardly disdeyne
When the furye of mars was most to dread
To be venged they did their besy pain
And specially her worthy brethern tweyne
Fill on the cite Symeon and leuy
To avenge their suster and stroy it finally
So mortally they began with them strive
With their swerdys ground sharp and kene
Of male children they left none alive
They were so vengeable in their furious lene
The Sychanytes might not sustene
That day again them to stand at diffence
So importable was their violence
For where that god list punyssh a man of right
By mortal sword farwele all risistence
When grace fails force goth awey and might
Febleth of princes the magnificence
Change their power into impotence
Reuerseth the kings their statly regalye
Exaumple in Sichen for his false auoutrye
It was an hard dreadful punycion
That one princis trespass in lecherye
Caused before god that all a region
Destroyed was without remedy
This story told for to exemplifye
When noble princes to wymen them submit
Grace and all favor anon does from them fly
Of this matter what should I write more
In genesis the residue ye may read
The death of Sichen and of king Emor
And how their kingdom destroyed was in deed
Of Sychanytes lo here the final mede
Of lecherye and of his false plesaunce
Which many a realm has brought unto mischa^
What should I eft rherce again or write
The false auoutrye of Paris and heleyne
Their woeful fall Guido did endyte
Poets echon eke did their besy pain
To declare how only by these tweyne
The worthy blood for short conclusion
Of troy and greece came to distruccion
But often it falls that much habundaunce
Of worldly good with great case and richesse
In folk that set all holy their plesaunce
To follow their lustys and froward wilfulness
Has caused in lands great mischeef and distress
When vicious life their corages did encombre
Destroyed kingdoms and people out of noumbre
For when the people through falls obstynacye
Is indurate to amend them and correct
And will not turn them from their lechery
But ay be red^ their soulys to enfect
And unto purpos my style I will direct
To exaumplifye how Gabaa the town
Was for his sins brought to confusion
Whilom this people called Gabonytes
From beniamyn descendyd in their line
Were ay disposyd to follow their delites
And of custom their wits did enclyne
In worldly plente to flower and to shine
And dempt alwey to them it was most due
Of wylfulnesse their lustys for to sue
In lecherye was set all their plesaunce
And in that vice they lad most their life
Whereby they were brought unto myschaunce
And many slain by full mortal strife
When the leuyte came forby with his wife
Full excellent of fetures and beutye
And took his lodging within that great cite
He was full old and she was inly fair
He impotent and she but tender of age
Through Gabaa making there repair
The citesynes of importune rage
Showing the fury of their great outrage
So long that night her bewtye did assail
Till life and breath atonys did fail
Contagious the sclaundre and the diffame
In iudicum the story ye may read
Which to reherce is a manner shame
To here the abusion of that foul deed
And how the leuite amorowe began take heed
With pitous chere and saw his young wife
Tofore the gate depryued of her life
He hent her up and laid her on his ass
To noise this crime upon every side
Though in such cas he might do no less
Took a sharp sword and list no lengre abide
On twelve perties he began her to divide
And to each trybe of jacob he has sent
A certain pertye to se their judgment
Which thing to them was hatefyll and terrible
And in their sight full abhomynable
And in all haste likely and possible
All of one will and one courage stable
On Gabynates for to be vengeable
They gadryd have shortly to conclude
Tassaile that town a full great multitude
When they first met atwene them thus it stood
The twelve tribus were twyes put to flight
On outher pertye great quantyte of blood
Was shed among them in that mortal fight
For sixty thousand who that coumpte a right
Were slain there the story will not lie
To avenge the sclaundre of falls auoutrye
Loo here the guerdon of the froward firis
In lecherous folk that will not staunchyd be
That brent so hot through bestyall desiris
In Gabaa the mighty strong cite
Which was destroyed for his inequite
And almoost brought of beniamyn the line
Through his offense to eternal ruin
Eke for his fervent dronkyn lecherye
Olophernes by Judith lost his head
And all his host and all his chyualrye
Left the field and fled away for dread
And he lay bathyd in his blood all read
Thus through their vice if it be well sought
Full many a prince has be brought to naught
These said stories ought Enough suffice
If men would considre and take heed
The great vengeaunces in many sundry wise
Which god has take for this sin in deed
As in their books they may behold and read
Warnynges before full often put at preef
How they them silf shall save fro myscheef
Lenuoye.
tHis tragedye yeueth us a great warning
By clear exaumples of many fold reason
How many a prince for their misleuynge
And many rich royal mighty town
Many a cite and many a regyon
Have been ever since full notable and famous
For sin of princes that were lecherous
The chose of god david the worthy king
Prophet of prophets most souereyn of renoun
On Bersabe for a sodeyn lokinge
To slay vrye caught occasion
For which he suffryd great punycion
Chastised of god he and all his house
For cause only that he was lecherous
Great repentance he had and great sorowynge
And made psalmys of great contricion
With woeful teerys and manyfolde wepinge
To make a seth for his transgression
y^uynge to princis full clear direccion
For to eschwe the flaterye odyous
And the false fraud of woman lecherous
When was there ever of science or cu^nynge
So renomed as was king Salamon
Yet wymen made him through falls flateringe
To foreyne goddis done oblacion
Which clipsed his honor and brought his fame dou^
That was in whilom most virtuous
Till he through wymen fill to be lecherous
Is it not eke remembryd by wrytinge
Of israel how the cheef champion
Which goddis people had in his ledynge
I mean the famous mighty strong Sampson
That through his force torent the lion
But dalida with terys plentuous
His grace bereft him and made him lecherous
Sichem was slain eke for the rauysshinge
^f young dyna as made is mention
His fader Emor brought to his ending
Lost his riches in that descencion
And his kingdom brought to destruction
Loo here the end of princes vicious
Which them dispose for to be lecherous
It is in earth one the most perilous thing
A prince to be of his condition
Eff^mynat his wittys e^lynynge
By falls desires of flesshly mocion
To put him silf under subieccion
And thrall his reason tresour most precious
To the unlawful lustys hateful and lechorous
This is the sentence full pleynly in menynge
Where wymen have the domynacion
To hold the reyne their hokys out tastynge
That censualite has Iurisdiccion
To enter on reason by falls intrusion
Werre again virtue most contagious
To be venquesshyd of lustys lecherous
It takes fro men their cleernesse of seeing
Causes great sickness and corrupcion
And to all virtue it is gretest hindrynge
Makes men seem old as by inspeccion
Appallith their mind and disposicion
Shortith their days thing dreadful and pitous
When they dispose them to be lechyrous
Noble princes in your ymagenynge
Conceive of wymen the false decepcion
Namely of them that love but for winning
And labor ay for your possession
Whoos sugared flatrye is false collusion
Like to Syrenes with vois melodious
Enoynte your erys to make you lecherous
How Cambyses assenting to the murdre of his brother mergus / at the last
slough him silf
AFetr the death o^ mighty king cirus
Next came his son called cambyses
Heir by succession full victorious
Which tofore bochas put him silf in prees
And began his compleynt this is doutles
That they of Egypt in many uncouth wise
To sundry goddys did sacrifise
First unto apys they did sacrifise
Called Serapys their gretest god of all
Regnynge in egypt most o^ excellence
And god of goddys folys did them call
And of his noblesse thus it is befall
Slain by his brother which is a great wonder
Severed on pecis and full far cast asondre
And they of egipte made their ordenaunce
Upon pain of death in their statute old
A god to call him and do their obseruaunce
Within his templis like as they were hold
Whereof Cambices tofore as I you told
All the temples of that region
Cast him by force for to throwdoun
The temple of Jupiter to rob it by rauyne
Called amon without excepcion
His knights sent to bring it to ruin
But they echon for their presumpcion
With sodeyne leuene were smet and beat down
Whereof Cambises in asye tho regnynge
Had this dreme as he lay slepynge
He drempt his brother that called was Mergus
Should in the kindom after him succeed
Whereof in heart he were so enuyous
That he purposed of rancoure and hatrede
By some mean to make his sides blede
And that his purpos should take avail
A magicien he took to his counsel
And he was hold a full great philosophre
Collyd cometes full sleighty and cu^nynge
To whom cambises made a full large profre
Of gold and tresoure to make him assenting
To execute this horrible thing
And that he would in most cruel wise
The murdre of Mergus compass and divise
And while cambices ordained this ^^eson
To sle mergus his own brother dear
God from above cast his iyen down
Him to punissh in full cruel manner
For he wexed wode who so list to lere
Caught a sharp sword and roue his thigh on twene
And suddenly he dyed for the pain
For two causes god took on him vengeance
As mine auctour bochas does express
For his presumptuous and falls disabeisaunce
Spoilynge the gods of her great richesse
And for the froward great unkindness
To give assent to the contagious cas
When that mergus his brother murdered was
The death of whom was cheef occasion
Of full great werre stryues and debate
Eke fynall cause why all the region
Of mighty Perce stood disconsolate
For heir was none of high nor low estate
By title of right through his unhappy chance
To be there king and have the governance
For the magycien called cometes
Which slough mergus as ye have herd express
To^e his brother called dropastes
And made him king the story bears witness
Because that he resemblyd in likeness
Unto mergus of face and of stature
To crown him king therefore he did his cure
The death of mergus outward was not know
Nor pleynly publised in that region
His body buried and cast in earth low
Of whom the murdre and fraudolent treson
The pitous slaughter wrought by collusion
And all the manner by process was espied
So openly it might not be denied
And in what wise the noise began out sprede
Touching this murdre odious for to here
When that oropastes occupied in deed
The crown of perce the story does us lere
There was a prince full notable and entere
Called hostanes than began his wit apply
Of high prudence this murdre out tespye
While that oropastes under a falls pretense
Of perciens was received as for king
The seyde prince did his diligence
By inquisicion to have knowlegynge
By what ingyne or by what sleighty thing
The seide oropastes caught occasion
Instead of mergus to occupye the croun
On this matere he had a conjecture
That his title was nouther hole ne clear
The troth to try he did his besy cure
And to search out holy the manner
He sought so far that he came right nere
And in this cas lettyd for no sloth
Till that he had found out the troth
The cas was this pleynly to termyne
He had a daughter full fair of her visage
Which of the king was cheuest concubyne
By whom he thought to catch advantage
And unto her he has sent his message
Secrely to enquere how it stood
Where that the king were come of cirus blood
And bad that she should secrely take heed
While that he slept to do her besy pain
With her hands for to feel his head
And to grope after both hiserys tweyne
And if it fill there is no more to seyne
Upon his head that she none erys found
To tell her fader of troth as she was bound
This mighty prince hostanes knew well
Right as it is recordyd by scripture
Touching this cas how it stood every dell
How king Cambises of sodeyn adventure
By his live for aforfeture
Made of Oropastes the story seith not nay
But his tweyne erys to be cut away
And herupon to be certyfied
He was desirous to have full knowlegynge
Which by his daughter when it was espied
Upon a night lyenge by the king
Gropynge his head as he lay slepynge
Full subtle felt and took good head
How he none erys had upon his head
And to her fader anon she has declared
The secretnesse of this adventure
And for no fere nor dread he has not spared
How that it stood pleynly to discure
And first of all he did his besy cure
All the princes of perce lord I feere
To counseyle call to entrete of this matere
And when they were assembled euerychon
Of Oropastes he told them all the chance
And how that mergus was murdered yorengon
As ^^re tofore is put in remembrance
Whereupon to set an ordenaunce
And to redress these wrongs done toforne
Of perce land were seuene primes ^rne
Of one assent in their entencion
^y bond of oath they made their assurance
And a full secret comunicacon
To put Oropastus from his royal puissaunce
Which had all perce under his governance
By a full falls pretense of heritage
For he was like to mergus of visage
These seuene princes of which toforne I told
All of one heart and by their oath Ibounde
Prudent and manly and of yerys old
Have sought a time Oropastes to confound
And with their swerdes sharp whet and ground
Under covert in their apparaile
Came of intent Oropastes to assail
And in the palcis whom ever that they met
Or again them made resistance
All of accord they feersly on him set
But the magicien that was there in their presence
Came ageyn^ ^ym by sturdy violence
And at (...) began them so constreyne
That of the princis they have I slain tweyne
But finally the the other princes five
When that they saw their tweyne f^eris blede
In all the paleys they left none alive
And king Oropastes quakinge in his dread
Full unwarily or that he took head
Was slain there guerdoned for all his might
Of pretense kings that regne and have no right
How Oropastes occupied the crown of Perce by Iniust title was murdered
For like thy mother if thou receive me
And me accept unto thy presence
I must thereafter so governed be
To tell my tale plainly in sentence
So that thou give me friendly audience
And if I be not received in such wise
More strongly my tale I must divise
This noble prince this Corolian
When that he herd his mother thus complain
Full like a lord and a knightly man
Began her enbrace in his armies tweyne
In louly wise there is no more to seyne
Sauf like a son of due and right
To her he said full like a gentle knight
Madame quod he be it to your plesaunce
To here my conceyte as in this matere
With feythfull heart and humble attendaunce
I you receive as for my mother dear
But and ye like benyngly to here
The ingratitude done in most cruel wise
To me of romans I purpos to chastise
A son quod she touching their offense
Done to thy noblesse and their great outrage
They shall by menys their trespass recompense
And think thou art borne of their lynage
And suffer that mercy thy rigor may aswage
And think of nature thou may not well with seye
Thing for the which thy modre does now preye
Thou shall not close thyn entrayles of pite
To the requestys of me and of thy wife
Nor gynne a werre again thy cuntre
To stroye thy line by new mortal strife
Thy children and me to make us lose our life
Weye in balaunce to romans thyn hatred
Ageyns the love of me and of thy kynrede
Send home again thy strange soudiours
Which been so ready the romans blood to shede
Let stand in pees our walls and our toures
Suffer thy grace thy rancoure to excede
So that thy pity may put away all dread
And condescende to receive for hostage
Me to be pledge for their great outrage
Behold the womb in which that thou were borne
And se ^lso my nakyd sides tweyne
By which thou were fostred here toforne
If there were lack thou woldist cry and pleyne
Remember thereon and at me not disdeyne
But unto mercy receive this cite
At the request here of thy wife and me
Whilom my milk thy cherisshinge was and fode
To s^ynte thy cry when thou dydest weep
There sote dropys full holsom were and good
Thy tender youth for to preserve and keep
And like a modere to bring the a sleep
I woke full often to the I was so kind
Wherefore dear son on my request have mind
If that thou list this cite now torment
Their demeritys by rigor recompense
Punysshe me for them and I will assente
To bear the gilt of their great offense
But dear son let thy magnificence
Suffer of knighthode that mercy may in deed
Attempre thy right or thou to dome proceed
Suffer romans to live in quiet
Grant them pees again their great outrage
Some drop of pite let in thyn heart flete
And think thou art borne of their lynage
Look upon them with merciful visage
Which offer them silfe as they shall fulfill
Their lif their death all holy at thy will
Remember of nature how that the lion
Set aside his rage and his woodnesse
To them that mekely before him fall down
His royal kind will do them no duresse
Texemplyfye to knightly noblesse
With rigorous sword thou shall no more manace
Them that be louly yield unto thy grace
And when this prince this Corolian
Had herd all that his mother list to seyne
He goth to her in all the have he can
Bespreynt with terys that on his chekys reyne
And her enbracyd with his armies tweyne
And said mother there may be no lettynge
Me hole of heart to grant your axynge
The sege he made for to avoid away
And to repair home to their cuntre
And with his mother and wife he was that day
With great gladness and solempnite
Anon received into that cite
Like as fortune him never would have failed
But she sone after of new has him assailed
The gery romans stormy and unstable
Which never in one still could abide
Again this prince most knightly and notable
For to conspire of new they began provide
And banysshed him to Tuskan there beside
Where he was slain within a litytell space
For he the romans before took to grace
How Melciades duke of Athenys with small noumbre venquesshyd ^i C M perciens /
and after by his comonte that ay of custum desires a change of princes new
he was cheyned in prison and so dyed
Among other that put them silf in prees
For to beweyle their grievous heaviness
Came of Athenys duke Melciades
Which through his manhood and famous high prowess
And through his knightly renomed noblesse
Like as auctours his tryumphes list commend
Faught many a battle his cite to defend
And of victories as it is compiled
For common profit of that notable town
Fought with a tiraunt that was tofore exiled
C^lled hippias which by falls treson
Had to king Darye made a suggestyon
Upon athenys in all the have he might
To ^^ise all perce again that town to fight
Six hundred thousand acou^ted was the noumbre
Of pereus armyd in plate and mayle
T^^ym of Athenes by force to encombre
Echone assembled them proudly to assail
^ut this duke for no thing would fail
Melciades but knightly took his place
With ten thousand he met him the in face
For both he was right manly and right wys
And of his handys prouyd a right good knight
Set upon them with so prudent auys
That they of perce for all their great might
Were four times put unto flight
By thilke duke if I shall not feyne
And by the noblesse other knights of tweyne
Themystodes I called was the tone
Whice of his hand as auctours list discriue
Was in a feelde prouyd on his fone
The manly knight in his time alive
Which thylke day so proudly did strive
Again them of perce and such a slaughter ma^e
That finally the feeld they have forsake
Cynegirus a knight eke of that town
The same day through his chiualrye
With blody sword as he went up and down
Without noumbre in his malencolye
Slough perciens bokys specify
That for the time that they no refute cu^ne
Save to their ships for dread of death the ru^ne
And there he wrought a strange great merueyle
As writes bochas affermynge in certain
The gretest ship that bare largest sail
With his right hand he began it so restreyne
Like as it had be fastened with a cheyne
Maugre Perciens which did them sore grieve
That by no craft they could not make it meue
But when that they none other refute wist
Freely to escape out of his daungere
Till they his right hand hughe of by the wrest
But with his left hand he began approach nere
And held it still an uncouth thing to here
That he had force so great a ship to let
But than alas his left hand of they smet
Yet maugre them when he their malice sees
All were it so that he had lost each hand
The ship he held still with his teeth
That they ne might depart from the land
Like as their vessel had fall upon sand
Causer that day mine auctour does reherce
Two hundred thousand were slain of them of per^e
And when this singular mighty champion
Cynegirus most uncouth of courage
Had done this marueyle as made is mention
Of very anguyssh he fill into a rage
Like a be furious and savage
Ran about alas for lak of mind
In bochas book no more of him I find
But in this process after I beheld
Ay how that fortune can her frendys fail
For Melciades leder of that feelde
And gouernoure of all that great battle
Causynge victory as made is rehersayle
Yet his people of malice and of ire
Again his noblesse falsely began conspire
They of Athenys set him in prison
And in cheynes mightily him bound
Unkindly they yaue him this guerdon
For all the knighthode they in him found
Yet had he suffered many mortal wound
In their diffence and for their libertees
To save their lives their town and their cuntrees
This was the end of duke Melciades
Through the constreynt of his strong bonds
Eke they exiled the knight Themystodes
Out of their town to live in the strange lands
That was so worthy prouyd of his hondis
To show the change and mutabilite
Found in fortune and every comonte
Lenuoye
THe stormy trust of every comonte
Their gery corages and troubled co^staunce
In this tragedye men may behold and se
Now up now down as fortune cast her chance
For they of custum have joy and most plesaunce
In their desires unsteadfast and untrue
To see each day a change of princes new
Corolian of rome a cheef cite
Was there protectoure through his mighty puissaunce
Venquesshed their enemies set them in suerte
Brought in rebellis to their obeysaunce
But they ageynwarde of wilful variaunce
Banysshed him twyes and n^ cause knew
Save for to se a change of princes new
The knightly nobles the magnanymyte
The police the prudent governance
Of Melciades duke of the cuntre
Where that athenys is cheef town in substance
When he their common ganne most to auaunce
The more unkindly in honor that they grew
Most they were besy to change him for a new
Themystodes having the souereynte
Of knights all that barespere or lance
During his time I take no more on me
For comparisons do often time great greuaunce
Six hundred thousand he put to vttraunce
Unto Athenys never found untrue
Yet they conspired his exile for a new
What thing may here flower in felicite
Or stand stable by long contynuaunce
In high estates outher in low degree
Now flow now ebb now joy now mischaunce
After fortune holds the balaunce
And specially falls feynynge and untrue
Commons desire a change of princes new
Noble princes in your prosperity
On sodeyne chaunges set your remembrance
Fresshnesse of flowers of braunchis the beute
Have ay on change a trembling attendaunce
In trust of commons is no perseueraunce
As winter and Somer been diverse of their hew
So be they diverse in change of princes new
How xerses king of Perce for his rauyne / and couetise was dismembryd in
small pe^ys
ANd tofore bochas full pitously wepyng^
For to declare his dedely heaviness
Came xerses next of Perce king
And began complain his dool and his distress
Which in three things the story bears witness
And as the cronycle clearly can us tell
All other princes in earth he did excelle
In high estate was none so great as he
Nouther in richesse nor wordly habundaunce
Nor none that time of so great dygnite
For as it is put in remembrance
He had all Perce under his obeysaunce
Nor never prince as auctours do conclude
Hosteyed attonys with such a multitude
Space of five year he had his ordinance
Seuene hundryd thousand people he did reyse
Dempte of falls pride again his great puissaunce
None erthely power might counterpeyse
But su^me auctours allow him not nor preyse
Because they he people to encombre
Set all his trust to conquer with great noumbre
But manly princes have this opinyon
In multitude stondeth not victory
For knightly prowess of every chaumpion
Which manly ^ast them in armies to have victory
Enprentyd has fix in his memory
Marciall triumphs god ne does not show
In noumbre great no rather than in few
This seyde xerses by record of auctours
Had also in chronicles as I read
Three hundred thousand strange soudeours
Without other that were of perce and mede
Which began the earth for to cure and sprede
Dried ryuers they did atteyne
^a^f down hills and made valeis oleyue
This was cheef conceyte of his fantasies
To have all earth under subieccion
Thought his power raught above the skies
Of surqu^dye and falls presumpcion
For as he dempte in his opinion
How in his power plainly that it lay
Fro god of heuene the heuene to take away
But thilke lord that can the meke enhaunce
And from their seys the proud put down
And namely them that have no remembrance
To advertise of wisdom and of reason
To know the lord most mighty of renoun
The lord of lords which plainly to compile
Will suffer tyrauntys to regne but a while
And one the marueyle that ever I did read
G^^est and uncouth plainly unto me
^o how yerses king of perce and meede
For to show a special singulerte
Out of Asie over the great fe
As says mine auctour whom I dare aledge
Into Europe made a mighty bridge
Su^me men parauenture will thereat disdeyne
And (...) is a marueyle not credible
Yet craft in ^aas to such thing may atteyne
Which by nature seems an impossible
And as to me it is a thing odible
Things to inpugne autentike and old
Which notable clerks in their days told
These new men that have but lityll seyn
Nouther expert in craft nor in nature
For lack of reason hold all such thing veyn
Though that it be remembered in scripture
For every maruayle and every adventure
Is to strange to him as I reherce can
That lacks the cause whereof the ground began
This seyde xerses had eke possession
By the title of his fader darye
Of all egypt as made is mention
But they of greece were to him contrary
Wherefore he cast no longer for to tarry
This proud prince but mightily werreye
Lacedomynoys which would him not obey
But one that was callid Demeratus
Which of that cuntre had before be king
And was exiled the story tells us
That time with xerses in household abidynge
Which loved that land for all his exilinge
Gave them warning to save them fro myschau^ce
Of xerses power and all his ordenaunce
He wrote them letters graven in a table
All thenprises of xerses out of doubt
Of all his stuff and people incomperable
And of his noumbre and his great route
The which table cured was without
Full subtly with wexe I planed plain
That of his sonde there was no lettre seyne
Thus was thentent of xerses first discured
Unto the Grekis and all his false werkinge
But in one thing they greatly were assured
Of trust they had by expert knowlegynge
In Leonidas their noble famous king
Which among Grekys of prowess and for sight
Was in tho days hold for the best knight
Of chiualrye called the lode sterre
The sum of knighthode yt shone so bright ^ shene
The berre up both in pees and werre
And strengest pylere his party to mayntene
The Grekys right hand their noblesse to sustene
Charbon^le of armies myrrour of policy
And surest capteyne a field to rule and guye
And as mine auctour remembrethe in his book
How in this caas he was not recheles
But in all have four thousand men he took
To let the weyes and coming of xerses
And by an hill called Thermophiles
Where perciens began first their viage
He knightly cast to stop their passage
The murdre of xerses outward was unknow
Nor how artabanus had the treson wrought
Till afterward within a litell throw
He had of new forged out and sought
Falls odious traynes that were never thought
Told artaxerses as he began with him rowne
How darye cast to occupy the crown
And how the death of xerses was ordained
Only by darye and by none other wight
Whereupon which ought be compleyned
Artaxerses provided anon right
The slaughtre of darie and so again all right
This young brother in his Innocence
Was falsely slain and did none offense
Ye wite by whom this treson was compassed
Twene brethren theyne to make division
The younger slain and no thing trespassed
Most ready wey to the destruction
Of artaxerses for in conclusion
When the brethren murdered were in deed
Artabanus thought to succeed
But artaxerses by pleyne instruccion
Of one that was called Baccarus
By toknes knew the covert falls treason
Of this forsaide double artabanus
And how that he by treynes outrageous
Had xerses slain as ye have herd to forne
And darye appechyd whereby that he was lorne
But this uncouth strange treson wrought
When artaxerses had knowlegynge
By great aduys weyes he has sought
Artabanus to bring unto reckoning
But specially he dred him of one thing
He feeble was to bring this thing about
Of his seuene sons he had so great doubt
But for to accomplissh fully his intent
Full secrely this was his ordenaunce
To all the worthy he has his letters sent
Dwelling in perce under his obeysaunce
Without excuse or longer attendaunce
Armyd echon and especial
To come in have unto his court royal
Cause of their coming was to him not know
The kings purpos was holden secre
And kept so cloos both from high and low
That to his menynge no man was pryue
Except the king said he would see
What noumbre of men if it come to need
In his diffence he might gadre and led
And among other came artabanus
Unto the court and list not for to fail
A man that was cruel and coragious
Full of sleightes in all his gouernayle
Which thilke time armed was in mayle
For he with him none other armoure ladde
Save on his back an haburion he had
Than artaxarses being in his strength
To him abrayde of falls affeccion
For that my mayle wants of his length
I would with the change mine haburion
The the other having none evil suspeccion
Vngyrt him silf would no longer bide
Both sword and dagger cast them far aside
And while that he threw of his haburion
And with the mayle stopped was his sight
He being nakyd for short conclusion
The king out pulls a sword kene and bright
And through the heart he roue him anon right
And after that of indignacion
Took his seuene sons and cast them in prison
Of their end what should I more endite
Nor of their death make degression
God may his vengeance a while respite
But murdre will out and all such treson
And for artaban had a condition
Falsely to murdre as ye tofore have seyne
With unware murdre he gwerdoned was again
Thus ever murdre requires for his wages
Sclaundre importable odious for to here
A word diffamous most foul in all langages
The sound horrible by report to appear
A clyps duringe whoos derkenesse may not clear
For this word murdre most ougly and vnfaire
By a rehersinge infecteth all the air
Of Duke palantes and Spartenois werred them of Myssene for rauysshinge their
maidens
aFter the death and fatal caas
And pitous murdre of artabanus
Next in order apperyd to bochas
A mighty duke called palantus
Son of a knight named arathus
Which was exiled though he no treson meant
Out of his cite that called was Tarente
Upon his exile he sore began complain
Besechinge Bachas to get him a space
Within his book to write his grievous pain
Albe though he whilom stood in grace
By glad aspectis of fortunes face
For she him raised by favor of her might
To Dukes estate from a pore knight
But ^eriously this matter to conueye
How he was made duke and gouernoure
When Sperteyns began mortally werreye
Again Myssenys as says mine auctour
With great cos^age and diligent labor
And cause was this for they with mighty hand
Rauysshed by force all maidens of that land
For this people now named Spartenoys
As the story clearly can deuyse
Were called before Lacedomynois
In armies prouyd manly and right wise
And while they did a solemn sacrefise
Unto their gods the people of Messenye
Rauysshed their maidens or they it could espy
On which wrong for to do vengeance
The Spartenoyse caught indignacion
And of assent with all their hole puissaunce
They laid a syege round about the town
And of one will and one affeccion
They made a vow the syege when they begone
Never to depart till the town were won
Before the town fully ten year they lay
And fro the syege as they had made their oath
They not departyed nouther night nor day
But still abode and not a sondre goth
Thereof their wives being at home were wroth
To their husbondes a messangere they sent
Under these words declarynge their intent
Said it was not according with reason
They like wydous to live disconsolate
Without confort or consolacion
Far from their husbondys to stand desolate
Mischeuys considred that fall in each estate
By long absence which each man should dread
Through diverse sickness that fall in womanhede
The tide abide not for no manner man
Nor stynt her course for no creature
And herd it is as we reherce can
Thing to withstonde that comes of nature
Harm done by kind is froward to recure
And there is found full little sekirnesse
Where as nature afforceth brotylnesse
This little sonde ought Enough suffice
To declare damage that may fall
By long absence folks that been wise
Sumtyme departed again men may not call
That seldom is seen in love does appalle
And no thing makes more wives err
Than disseueraunce of folk that be in werre
This was the affect pleynly in substance
Sent to their husbondys which at the syege lay
Compleynynge they had had no plesaunce
Space of ten year as in loves play
But desolate in sorrow and great affray
Their life they ladde affermynge in sentence
Cause of their constreynt was their long absence
And when the letters were at the syege radde
Tofore the cite in all there mortal strives
They were astonyed and began to wax sad
And very weary almoost of their lives
For to considre the compleynte of their wives
Till their capteyne a remedy out sought
By whoos counseyle even thus they wrought
First old knights that the syege sworn
It for to accomplissh and cast them to be true
His counseyle was as they had hight beforne
To hold their promys and therefore no thing rue
But young knights that were come of new
Might as they list freely at their will
Chose whether they would goo or bide still
And herupon for their most avail
In have their capteyne as made is remembrance
Of high prudence yaue them their counsel
That knights old liche their assurance
Should of the siege have the governance
And young knights most fressh and welbeseyne
Should from the syege home be sent again
They made among them a full strange ordinance
At their home coming without difference
To entirchaunge their wives for plesaunce
And take her first that came to her presence
This was the accord among them in sentence
Most ready way to their opinion
To engendrure and procreacion
There was among them quarrel nouther strife
In this matere nor no variaunce
For every man mysused others wife
To their desires as was to them plesaunce
And thus children through this ordenaunce
That were engendryd the cas is thus befall
Parthenoys men did them after call
Which in our tunge to speak in words pleyne
After the greek who list considre and se
Is no more pleynly for to seyne
Than thilke children which engendered be
In auoutrye wherefore in that cuntre
Parthenois of custum they were named
Borne of wombes which that were diffamed
The false occasion of this auoutrye
Caused after great myscheef and damage
That noman could as for his party
By succession when he came to age
By title of right cleyme his heritage
For where a line falsely does proceed
Hard is to know by right who shall succeed
The disturbaunce of falls succession
And titles cleymed afforced with great might
Where that auoutrie has dominacion
And is supported of will and not of right
And cleyme of troth has lost his clear light
Though their parties mighty been and strong
God wilnat suffer they shall endure long
And Parthenoyse peisynge all these things
How falls assurance was in their synage
The gyntill blood troubled first of kings
For no man knew of high nor low parage
His own fader by liklynesse of visage
Nor fader none by his great error
Could give no title to his successoure
Whereupon followed a great myschhaunce
Hateful to here through the cuntre
Each man troubled in his countenance
Who should cleyme by any lyberte
To enter his land or to stand fre
Such doubt they had each man for his party
So importable was their auoutrye
This great myscheef who so takes head
By long process made them to know and se
How they were able as by lyklyhede
For their outrages for fall in pouerte
And of assent they cast them for to fle
Under a capiteyne by strong and mighty hand
For that cuntre to win sum other land
And as I read they chase duke Palantus
Of whom I spoke to govern the passage
Taking no leave the story tells thus
At their departinge beginning their viage
They were so confus of cheer and of visage
For there was none of that great route
To chose his fader but that stood in doubt
They held them silf very ashamed
And for shame out of that land they went
Like people disclaundred and diffamed
Through the auoutrye to which they did assent
And to a cite that called was Tarent
Which stant in Poile a mighty strong cuntre
This duke palantus came with his meyne
And there he put through his great might
The citezeines out of that cite
And gate Tarente full like a manly knight
And there abode in long prosperity
As gouernoure and duke of that cuntre
Till that his pople by falls collusion
Him to depryue sought out occasion
They him exiled when he was fall in age
Lo what it is in commons to assure
Stormy of heart unsure of their courage
That seelde or nouer their friendship does endure
Men may to day their favor well recure
And to morrow let set it at a preef
They rathest hindre when men stand at mischee
Of Ceson Quincius exiled and Grac^us take prysonere
I Can no more reherce of Palantes
Duke and leder of Parthenoys
But I will tell how Ceson quincius
Came tofore Bochas with a full pitous voys
His tale began how graccus prince of Equo^s
Both atonys began their song entune
Most doolfully to pleyne on fortune
This mighty prince Ceson quincius
Compleyned f^rst as made is mention
How they of rome were contrarious
And felly wrought to his distraccion
And full vnius^ly banysshed him the town
And not with standing he was a dictatoure
Him to confound they did their besy labor
Cause of his exile compassed as I read
That he was slough they seyde and neglygent
Him to defend touching appele in deed
Which again him was brought of falls intent
Yet Cin^nnatus his fader by assent
^ayde for amends as sey Crony^leris
Met out of land draught of three arblasteris
Yet his enmyes would not be content
(...) proceed that he was exiled
Did ^ytor^ion of his judgment
As in his story full plainly is compiled
(...) after never might be reconsiled
which I have pity to put in remembrance
So little offense should have so great vengeance
Grac^us of rome called Cloellius
Prince of Equois mine auctour seyth the same
Was in his time notable and glorious
And a great duke full renomed of fame
But how the people of Equois took first their name
Under support that no man have dysdeyne
I will the process declare here in certain
John Bochas says there is a nation
Which that first were called hunoys
And secondly also by succession
Of full long time named anathois
And olderlast men called him Equois
Like as I trow mine auctour seyth the same
Of horse most swyft they took first the name
And as it is remembered in sentence
By their manhood and famous hardynesse
Again alisaundre they made a strong diffence
On horsbacke through their great swyiftnesse
Beside the hill pleynly to express
Which in Chronicles is called Cancasus
This people of Equois were victorious
To their noblesse pleynly as I find
No thing in earth was more expedient
In their conquest of Ethiope and ynde
As horse most swyft serving their intent
Thereby conquerynge all the oryent
So great prowess was in their passage
That Equois brought all Egypt to seruage
Thus where ever Equois did abide
They gate great good to their possession
And Graccus was their gouernoure and guide
Which by his sterynge and falls suggestion
Again the romans fill in great rebellion
But to withstonde him they sent out anon right
Cincinatus proved a full good knight
He was well trusted and know in the town
And for his prudence chosen a dictatour
His liflode small and his possession
Albe he was a worthy werrour
Which has venquesshed by his knightly labor
The seyde Greccus for all his worthy power
And hom to rome brought him prisoner
Cyncinatus in his chaar was set
Called quincius for this great victory
And most solempnely with senators met
Which yaue to him for to encrece his glory
Laud of triumph to put him in memory
And Graccus after for his rebellion
With cheynes bound cast in a derke prison
And there he dyed in full great myscheef
After his conquestis first famous and notable
An evidence to us and a great preef
How fortune is ay falls and unstable
Ever double froward and deceyuable
The fall of Graccus declare can full well
That whilom sat so high upon her whele
Here Bochas rehercith the tyranny of Apius and falsnesse of Iuges
NAtwithstondynge Bochas tofore has told
Of apius the falsnesse importable
And his outrages and surfetys many fold
To be remembered hateful and repreueable
^t as him thought it was here couenable
To more rebuke and spottynge of his name
^ewe to reherce his sclaundre and diffame
The great offenses of this apius
And oppressions that he upon him took
Made him grow so inly covetous
Through his rauyne that all the people quoke
As ye may se in the second book
Where mine auctour does clearly specify
His fraud in domys and his lecherye
Eke this tyrant remembered ye may read
Cheef judge he was with other officers
Called Decemvir and through his pride in deed
Again the custum of them that were his feris
He made to be borne standards and baneris
In other wise of high presumpcion
Than vsis were beforne in rome town
These Iuges had a custum and manner
Like their estates in their governance
Each after to have borne a banere
Where they went such was their ordenaunce
By twelve sargeauntes noumbred in substance
But apius of pride and great outerage
I changed has that castum and usage
He first ordained each should in his place
Of Decemvir have a banere borne
In their walkinge the people to manace
An hundred men of armies them beforne
And twenty over by a statute sworn
Whereby the cite bare great cost in deed
And all the people were put in fere and dread
To see the sargeauntes walk in plate and mayle
They thought it was a merueylous werkinge
Iuges to go with such apparaile
In their procedynge as each had been a king
And hole thentent of apius menynge
Was that he should of power and might
Do what him list were it wrong or right
The rightful punysshe and the gylty spare
Favor wrong for brybes and for mede
The people oppressed stood in sorrow and care
Fond no socoure to help them in their need
Law was there none for reason lay by dread
Will was Judge and plesaunt equite
And thus by maistry was governed the cite
And as it is remembered by bochas
Apius was lecherous of nature
And caught a quarrel as ye have herd the cas
Again virgynya a maid clean and pure
And for he should no thing in her recure*
Touching his lust her fader in that strife
With a sharp sword made her lose her life
And for this tyrant by falls rebaudrye
Caused her death by hasty violence
And for he should her beutye not mastrye
Dyinge a maid in her chaste Innocence
Therefore he was demyd in sentence
As is tofore made clear mention
For to be cheyned and dye in prison
Eke decemvir lost their power
And never in rome after bare no name
Nor of that sect was made none officer
And among all apius bare the blame
Whoos crime reboundeth to his eternal shame
As ye have herd who that can discern
And than trybunys were chose for to govern
And in bochas like as it is found
The said Iuges in myscheef did fine
While apius lay in prison bound
Exyled were all that other nine
The good the tresoure of them and of their line
Achetyd was for short conclusion
To common profit and encrece of the town
Lenuoye
THis little tragedye does shortly d^uise
What myschef follows for the great unright
Vsyd by Iuges in many sundry wise
For when favor blinded has their sight
And Innocence is borne down with might
And in his quarrel pouert may not proceed
Because that troth oppressed is with mede
A judge should of equite despise
To take gifts of any manner wight
And ready be all wro^ges to chastise
From all gifts turn away his sight
His handys close his erys stop aright
And be ay ware for friendship hate or dread
That troth be not oppressed with mede
The noble doctrine and virtuous emprise
Of philosophers that had so great insight
Was this to iuges that prudent were and wise
For friend or foo their domys be so dight
Of rightwisnesse that the son bright
Eclipsed never list men for their falshede
Report that right was put abacke for mede
Noble princes supportours of Iustise
Called lode sterres to give the people light
On apius let Iuges not practice
That trouthis laumpe be clear both day and night
Your office p^^sed that longs to a knight
Hol^up the balaunce of dome in your manhede
That law in iuges be not corrupt with m^de
Bochas again the untruth of Iuges
SVynge upon the death of apius
And his rebukes for his great outrage
Bochas by wrytinge wexe su^what yrous
Again iuges falls and thought in his courage
They should be sad and demure of age
And their life by virtue should draw
To keep the precepts and statutys of the law
They ought of reason them silfe to habyle
To have science of philosophy
And know their textys of canon and civil
And thereupon their wittis hole to apply
For cu^nynge Iuges by prudent policy
Cause of ordenaunces in law comprehended
Through rightful dome greatly to be commended
Iustise of law does rumys enlumyne
Susteyneth troth supporteth Innocence
Of rauynours boweth down the chyne
Punyssheth robbours for their great offense
Sluggy traau^tes for their (...)
And feyned beggars that greatly dis^ (...)
Constreyneth them to labor and (...)
Foundours of law by antiquyte
Caused in lands was suffered none error
And made of princes the royal mageste
To shine in worship by diligent labor
Wrested corages of many conqueror
That their tryumphes no forther should atteyne
Than law of god and nature did ordeyne
Will was that time under subieccion
Of rightwysnesse by troth full well conveyed
Sensualite was servant to reason
And froward lust was under lok well keyed
Sentence of statutes was not disobeyed
The rich did right through every land
Pore folk^ lived by labor of their hand
Lordship that time avoided mayntenaunce
Holy church lived in persitnesse
Knigh^hode tho days for troth whet his lance
And falls extorcion had none interesse
Merchants winning came all of rightwyssnesse
Artificers the werkday weere not Idell
And business of labor held the brydell
Wymen that age farced were nor horned
Nor their tails were not serpentyne
Wise men of folly nor clerks were not scornyd
Which in science most fresshly did shine
Law disherited none heirs from their line
Lesyngmongers fond that time no socours
And flaterers were made than no confessors
This golden world flourynge in virtue
Borneup by love grounded on stablenesse
Of auoutry sprange out none Issue
Princes with doctrine establysshed their noblesse
Preesthode in prayere knighthode in worthynesse
Each thyinge by law stood under governance
Marchauntys by mesure and just peis of balaunce
First phoroneus by diligent labor
Fond out laws that king was of argyues
The Grekis study he gilt with great honor
This politic prince avoid them from stryues
His statutys kept during all their lives
Found first the manner bochas does devise
How to Jupiter was made sacrifise
Eke mighty myn^s whilom king of Crete
Ordained laws again transgressions
To fere by rigor f^lys that were unmeet
And staunch of surfetes all occasions
Made for robbers mighty strong prisons
And dedalus his cheef artificere
Made laborintus by diligent entere
And mercury borne by the flode of Nyle
As writes lattance was of egypt king
Unto merchants did law first compile
Of weight and mesure to us in chaffaringe
And for his wisdom and excellent cu^nynge
Of old p^tys that whilom were so wise
He called was god of marchaundise
Solon also the best laws made
As valare writes him silf to magnefie
Athenienses thereof were full glade
His great wisdom when they did epsy
They fond therein so much policy
And ever he was ready for to debate
Again tyrauntes so sore he did them hate
King Ligurgus yet whilom did his cure
To make laws to common advantage
And that they should perpetually endure
He made his people be sworn of every age
While that he went out on pilgrimage
Fro point ta point to keep them in certain
Unto time that he came home again
And for his laws were of great substance
And profitable to every comonte
He chase to live in exyll and penanuce
Never to resort again to his cite
That his statutes by eternyte
Should not be broke as ye have herd toforne
By the conuencyon to which they were sworn
To common profit had he such tendirnesse
That he forsook his kingdom and kinrede
To live in exyle his story bears witness
But or he dyed as he lay bedrede
He bad his bonys should be cast in deed
Amyd these fer out from the stronde
That his statutes might in their strength stand
He eschewed eueryche occasion
As a thing hateful which was not fair
That his forseyde royal mighty town
Should break their oath because of his repair
But touching that he put them in despair
Cast him never resort in their dawes
List they would break the sentence of his laws
Here Bochas makes an exclamacion of the extorcion of the officers of Rome
John bochas hers makes a digression
And by rebukinge cast him so tassayle
Thilke officers that were in rome town
Which by extorcion oppressed the poraile
And again Iuges also of Itayle
And namely them that lucre or mede
Set troth aside and took of it none head
He makes again them an exclamacion
Such as to virtue were contrarious
And under color and occasion
Of their office list to be lecherous
Like condition unto Apius
And finally as it was after seen
Falls in their domys and of their lif unclean
O quod bochas o troth o thou Iustise
Which in your noblesse whilom did excelle
Where in effect is now your exercise
Where is your wonynge alas where do you dwell
Of your practike full few men can tell
So far put back is now your disciplyne
Your kyn exiled and your noble line
Aduocatys that now done occupye
Your old sees and places full royal
All to falshede their wits they apply
Such couetise now regneth over all
Causes of civil and causes crymynall
Their domys take where they be falls or true
All after will by statutes changed new
There been eke other called accessours
Syttinge by Iuges to give them counsel
Which may full well be called rauenours
For they not labor but for their own avail
A noumbre of robbers follow at their tail
To pylle the people as ye have hard toforne
Bare as a sheep that is but new shorn
There is no more in this matter to seyne
Save only this trouthstant desolate
And rightwisnesse dare to no wight complain
With wrong oppressed wepinge and desolate
Wherefore ye princes that sit in high estate
Such thing to amend but ye better head list take
God shall with you a full hard reckoning make
Your office is in your magnificence
^wene man and man all wrongs to redress*
And where a matter is again conscience
Is to refourme only of rightwisnesse
To stand by troth maynteyne no falsnesse
And let wise counseyle such matters examyne
Or ye of have thereon determyne
Have such things in your mind among
Think god will quite like as ye deserve
Ye spot your noblesse if that ye do wrong
His sword of punysshinge dread or it kerue
Let your reason and conscience conserve
Your noble estates and think like your werkinge
The lord of you will axe a reckoning
Of Alcibiades exiled and after brent in his bed
AFter other that put them silf in prees
Tofore bochas their compleintis to discure
Came of Athenys alcibiades
That t^me alive the fairest creature
And as it is remembered by scripture
He was discrete and was at all assayes
O^e the s^r^ngest and manly in his days
He was first borne of full high lynage
Above all other of most semelynesse
Well proporcioned and hardy of courage
Loved and well sauoured for his great fairness
Famous in knighthode for his worthynesse
Subtle witted and could by eloquence
Much comprehendyd under short sentence
His wit enclyned to many fold sciences
Had of cu^nynge a passinge retentyf
Loved clerks and fond them their dispences
Such as in practif he saw most inuentif
To read in books reioysed all his lif
Kept what he read in his memorial
And of wise counseyle was none to him egall
An uncle he had I called perioles
Which stood in daungere of excessif spending
Yet in his youth this Alcibiades
Seeing his uncle pensif in lokinge
Cast of wisdom to remedy that thing
And for to aswage his hertis heaviness
Gave him this counseyle by great auisenesse
First to reherce how the matter stood
And of uncles woeful high distress
There was to him delivered a su^me of good
To repair the temple of a goddess
Called minerua but for the great excess
Of his dispencis he stood su^what in dread
Touching thacoumpte which he must yield in deed
Alcibiades hereupon musing
To his uncle gave counseyle in sentence
Uncle quod he let be your thinkinge
And for your silf shape this diffence
Not for tacoumpte by mean of your prudence
Before provided with face and chere unfeigned
To such duresse that ye be not constreyned
And when perioles his counseyle aduertiseth
Fond to his worship it was reasonable
And by good leiser him silf full well auyseth
And by provision prudent and notable
Saved his estate from each thing repreuable
So that he stood touching this matere
As for accoumptis out of all daungere
Alcibiades of athene cheef capteyne
From day to day wax up to great encres
Such another was there no where seyne
Them to govern both in werre and pes
And all the Cite by assent him ches
Of their nauye in especial
Upon the se to be their admiral
For his knighthode they sent him out aferre
To Cathenois to be their gouernoure
Geyne Ciracusenes for to gynne awerre
First there received with glory and great honor
But in the end of his great labor
Fortune that is aye varyaunt and vnstale
Was to this duke not found favorable
He was accused to them of the town
Which in athenys had governance
That he was gilty in party of treson
By them reuokyd for all his great puissaunce
Of capteynship and by their ordenaunce
And fortunes falls mutabilite
Unwarily pryued from all dignite
But for him silf thus he began provide
Went into exyll not far fram that cuntre
Into a cite that called was Elyde
There for to have fredom and liberte
And of his life to stand in suerte
For in athene they would have him deed
Unto their gods to offer up his head
But when he was of their intent certain
To Lacedomoyn he took the right way
And by relacion there he herd seyne
How Cathemenses were put to a fray
In a battle upon a certain day
Which that they held to their aduersite
Geyne Cathenoys as they faught on the sea
But the cause of this disconfiture
As was told to alcibyades
Was by three capteyns through their mysauenture
Which in their ledynge were found recheles
The cheef of them named domestenes
The the other called the story tells us
The tone Niceas the the other Eurilocus
Alcibiades having hereof tydinge
To avenge his wrong put him silf in pres
Of Lacedomoyn he goth first to the king
Which of troth was called Agydes
Besechinge him to grant to his encres
Certain soudiours out of his cuntre
For to werreye athenoys the cite
Thus he wax strong of noble providence
Had great people under his governance
And like a duke made strong in his defense
The people gadred to his obeysaunce
That other princes which were of high puissaunce
Began have envy of wylfull frowardness
And to malygne again his high noblesse
For seeld or never in any region
Prowess of armies nobles of cheualrye
Encres of riches report of high renoun
Fame of cu^nynge in craft or in clergy
May nowhere dwell without su^me envy
From whoos malice as folk expert may see
Save only wretchis no man has liberte
For which this prince as put is in memory
Escaped not for all his high parage
But that some enuyed at his glory
For in this life no man has advantage
Again tunges nor odious falls langage
To stop such venym this the best obstacle
That men with suffraunce tempre their triacle
The clear prowess of Alcibiades
Steyned the nobles of other princes
His cure him raised up to so great encres
To the heghest trone of fortunes hall
Such fatal grace is unto him fall
That in tho days pleynly this is no fable
There was in knighthode none to him resemblable
In his exyll so clear his renoun shone
And through Greece gave as great brightness
As does a tube above each other stone
Yet for to clips and shadow his worthynesse
Lacedomonois did their business
Such as not might to his noblesse atteyne
By falls report his renoun to restreyne
A wait was laid to take him at myscheef
And many treynes were serched out and sought
Of intent to put him at repreef
But all that ever again him they have wrought
At the end the purpos came to naught
For god provides of his magnificence
Again such malice to save innocence
He was likly to fall in great daungere
Lacedomonois began so at him disdeyne
Because his honor and nobles shone so clear
That to his fone it was a dedly pain
And thus his lif stood in no certain
For all be it he manly was and wise
He knew no thing their purpos nor malice
He had almoost I warned be to late
And like to have stand in great perplexite
And more his grace and fortune tabate
By thoccasion of his great beute
He with the queen was waxen full pryue
For in her grace so well stood there none
Which gave him warning of them yt were his fone
And by the counseyle only of the queen
Fro Lacedomoyne he wisly took his flylght
Toward athenys and thought he would seen
His own cuntre full like a manly knight
And though they had not governed them aright
Towardys him being in distress
To avenge his wrong he did them no duresse
For he thought it was again nature
To be vengeable or show his cruelte
By thoccasion of any adventure
Or gynne a werre upon his cuntre
His natyf blood meuyd him to pite
And of very natural gentylnesse
Was deboneyre again their unkindness
The cas was this for short conclusion
How king Dary with great apparayle
Thought to werreye of indignacion
Them of athenys and their town tassayle
And in purpos proudly to prevail
Thes^fferenes a prince of great puissaunce
Of Daryes power had all the governance
Fynall cause and ground of all this werre
That darius began on them so hastily
And that he sent his puissaunce from so far
For to destroy athenys utterly
Was to hold up and sustain the party
Of lacedomoyne which of old hatrede
Were ever enuyous them to oppress in deed
^ut by mean of Alcibiades
And his trete founded on prudence
Thesifferenes enclyned to the pes
Thereby in party tappese his violence
And all was done of noble providence
And fro the place to which he was exiled
He to athenys should be reconcyled
Unto the cite he did signefye
How darius had made his ordenaunce
And by his letters he began them specifye
If they would stand at his governance
To condescende pleynly in substance
He would labor and no longer tarry
To make accord atwene t^eym and king darie
This was the mean that he meant
Within athenys that the sanatours
Should of the cite after their intent
Have full lordship and be their governors
But as clear weddyr troubled is with shoures
Right so unwarily within that royal town
Through this trete fill a discencion
The co^moners began suddenly dysdeyne
To be so thralled under subieccion
And so by assent the commons did ordeyne
Oonly tappese all falls discencion
For to revoke again into their town
Alcibiades as they thought it mete
Through his prudence to set them in quyete
First in his coming mine auctour does report
He was made duke again of that cite
And began the party of commons to supporte
And them restore to their old liberte
Where through the senate dredynge the comonte
Fled into exyll full far out of all prees
Oonly for dread of alcibyades
They stood that time in so great disioynt
Their town divided and out of governance
That they were brought euene to the point
To yield the cite unto the obeysaunce
Of lacedomoyn through their unhappy chance
Within them silf when they began debate
Under their duke the Senate bare such hate
But the commons ches in their dyffence
Alcibyades to govern that vyage
And to the sea with cost and great dispense
Without abode he holds his passage
In mighty ships made for advantage
Well enarmed and cast if he might
With lacedomonois proudly for to fight
Three mighty capteynes were on that other side
The first zestro bochas tells thus
And the second that was their lord and guide
Called Mydare the thryd pharbanasus
On the se and land in armies full pompous
But of knighthode and magnanimite
Alcibiades took them all three
Strong was the fight or that they were take
Of all their meyne away there escaped none
The duke that day began such a slaughter make
Of high prowess upon his mortal fone
Cast over board almooost euerych^n
And after that when he came to land
Anewe battle met him on the str^nde
Such wait was laid about him enuyron
Of his enemies by sodeyne adventure
But of athenes this mighty champion
Which might in armies most souereynly endure
Made of his fone a new disconfiture
Thus in short time this prince in his estate
On land and water was twyes laureate
And after that he list not for to cesse
Nor tabyde the space of half a day
The common profit of his town tencrece
Toward Asye he took the right way
And touns castellys that were take away
Which apperteyned to athenys of right
He gate again full like a manly knight
Maugre all that to him were contrary
Or wrought again him by rebellyon
Throughoute asye in the land of darye
He knightly brought them to subieccion
Again whoos sword halpe no proteccion
And fynall labor was of his intent
The common profit of his town to augment
And with this glory and with this noblesse
He to athenys repeyred is again
And all the cite with joy and great gladness
Came out to mete him upon welfayre plain
And that his triumphs should openly be seyne
Both old and young with full glad visages
Of their goddys brought out the images
This was their cry and noise of all the prees
Victorious prince whoos triumphs marciall
Shall ever be song with laud and new encrees
Tofore the goddys which been immortal
Welcome welcome our protector and our wall
Sheeld of our welfare again all violence
Phoebus of knighthode and sword of our diffence
Thus with their goddys they made him egal
By uncouth preysurge of paganismes rightes
Like as he had be very immortal
And sange refreytes to comende his merits
And to enhaunce his glory they set all their delytes
And with the light of eternal fame
Set up torches to enlumyne with his name
Thus certain days they hallowed of intent
Through all the cite for his high prowess
Till fortune has his iyen blent
With new favor of worldly falls swetnesse
For all her sugar is meynt with bitterness
A bait of honey shad out at pryme face
With mortal venym hyd under to manace
For in his highest clymbynge up aloft
And in thascence of fortunes whele
After her custom as she has full often
When he best wend for to stand well
She drew her favor from him euerydele
Made the people under his obeysaunce
To fall in myscheef for lack of governance
Thus fro this duke fortune began to varye
And his noblesse goo bak and eke fail
When king Cirus successoure to darye
Full unwarily fill on him in battle
And began his knights proudly to assail
When he dispurueyed void of providence
Was ouerlayde to make resistance
For finally this alcibiades
At myscheef take which he might not recure
When through vein glory he was made recheles
His noble estate testablisshe and assure
Lack of forsight caused his disconfiture
And to encrees of more aduersite
Banysshed again out of his cite
Thus diffacyd and clypsyd was his glory
His cite put in strange governance
By lacedomonois after their victory
So that he knew no manner cheuisaunce
To refourme his unhappy chance
Save to refute mine auctoure does reherce
How that he fled unto the king of perce
From athenys of new he was exiled
And thritty persons furious and vengeable
Chase in their cite as bochas has compyled
The town governed albe they were not able
Vsinge a manner hateful and repreuable
Through their rauyne temporisshe their cite
A thing most odyous to all comonte
A worm of dread was bred up in their heart
Which suffered not them to live in pees
Among them silf when they did aduerte
The great prudence of alcibyades
How in manhood he was peerles
List he would after for all their multitude
Knightly acquit their ingratitude
And of assent to abrydge his live days
They again him of malice have conspired
After his exill to make no delays
For to accomplyssh that they long have desired
With brennynge hate their hertys falsely fyred
To murdre by envy causes again right
Alcibiades the noble worthy knight
Thus the time approached and the date
T^^me before set by constellacion
Of his parodye and his lives fate
Which was con^luded as made is mention
By cruel murdre to his distruccion
Alas what prince with gold or soudiours
^ay (...) provide again falls conspiratours
Fortune of new began at him enchace
From her traynes that he ne escape might
Daily pursued from place aye unto place
Through perce and meede though he were out of sight
Till that his enemies fill on him by night
Slepinge alas to sone they were sped
When they him fond they brent him in his bed
T^us by murdre their purpos was acheuyd
Alas it was to horrible a deed
(...) good a knight so well in armies preuyd
So ^^o^ed so famous in manhede
For to be brent among the coals read
(...) unwarily in his bed I take
And so confirmed among the coals blake
This was the end of alcibiades
Which in k^ighthode was most souereyne
In werre a lion and a lamb in pees
As ^ars victorious his sat so did ordeyne
To ^amys paleys he flees with wings tweyne
Sone to Mynarua to speak of high prudence
And like mercurye by notable eloquence
Here Bochas makes an exclamacion upon the death of Alcibiades
O Fatal sustren which span the lives threde
So short a term why did ye determyne
To suffer him brenne among the coals read
Ye were to hasty to break and untwine
His web of knighthode yt through the world did shine
And cast of noblesse his bemys out so clear
Alas that ever he fill in your daungere
Out on Stix and on attrapos
That have of malice slain so good a knight
Out on you three that keep your silf so clos
Daughter I called of the derke night
And thou le^u^ that queyntest eke the light
Of alcibiades myrroure and lantern
To speak in knighthode how men should the^ gou^ne
Ye sle the worthy and wretchis ye do spare
Torcites lives hector is slain in deed
Your funeral smokis makes realms now so bare
To race up Cedrys their branches may not sprede
Ye palle the laurer ye make the firses sede
Full little thank in kingdoms ye deserve
Caytifs to fostre and do the worthy sterue
Alcibiades is passed in to fate
Light of knighthode light clipsyd in the shade
The par^as susterne to sone set his date
Of his high noblesse to make the laurer fade
Lacedomonois of his death were glade
Funeral fire his body has diffred
For high prowess his soul stellefied
Lenuoye
ALas this tragedye does mine heart blede
My pen quaketh of ruth and of pity
In my writing when that I take heed
To see the strange feerfull diversity
Of all worldly unsure felicite
How from their sees shortly to comprehend
Froward fortune does princes down descend
Alcibiades of courage and of manhede
As is reherced in books ye may se
Of gentylnesse and of goodlihede
Of semelynesse of fredom of bountye
Of high prudence and magnanymyte
Was most famous as auctours him commend
Yet from his sete fortune made him descend
All the people both of perce and meede
While he governed Athenys the cite
Stood in his daungere and began his sword to dread
And all that were rebel to his cuntre
He chastysed them in their most cruelte
But when his fame began highest up to ascend
Down from her whele fortune made him descend
Murdre and treson with prudens frendlihede
Outward fair chere covert Iniquite
Plesaunce in spech and under that falshede
Honey shedoute sharp tayled like a be
Song of Sirenes to drown men in the sea
In one combyned their malice can extend
To cause princes down from their sees descend
Noble princes that se so much and read
Remembringe stories of antiquite
Before prou^^nge that treson not proceed
Be aye most dredefull in high prosperity
Let others falling a myrrour to you be
The turn of fortune all auctours reprehende
Where who sit highest is rediest to descend
Here bochas writes again the desires of people.
aFter this process if ye list to lere
Like as John Bochas makes mention
That wordly folk most souerenly desere
To have in lordship great axaltacion
And up to clymbe in their intencion
Of worldly worship to the highest place
All erthely tresoure atonys to enbrace
The fervent flame of their gredy desires
In much gaderynge finds no suffisaunce
Their hungry etike kindeleth so the fires
Of avarice by long contynuaunce
That their thrust with worldly habundaunce
On tantalus riuere abraideth ever in one
Drownyd in drinkinge and deem their partis none
There may no tresoure their dropsye well staunche
The more they drink the more they thurst in deed
In tagus flodys the depper that they launche
The gretter dryness does in their brestys bread
The higher water an ebb most they dread
Falls indigence their heart has so confounded
At the fullest sees they seem their barge is grounded
Thus every man would to great richesse atteyne
With suffisaunce but few hold them content
Who most haboundeth now rathest will co^pleyne
For lack of good alas how they be blent
Where shall there gadring where shall there good be spent
Sum one parcas shall them thereof discharge
Whom they most hate and spend it out at large
Within a body full litell of stature
Corages grow up to their magnificence
Which up tascende do their besy cure
And in their clymbinge and transitorye ascence
Having an hope of worldly appearance
Like as no thing their puissaunce might trouble
No thing aduertinge how fortune is double
Su^me set their joy in conquest and in werrys
To enbrace all earth under their puissaunce
Like as they might reche above the sterrys
To bring down heuene unto their obeysaunce
But if their power were weyed in balaunce
And counterweyed aright in their memory
They should well find that all is but veynglorye
What may avail them their fethirbeddys soft
Shetys of reins long large and wide
Diverse deuyses or clothes chaungyd often
Or vicious meyne walkinge by their side
Void of virtue ambicious in their pride
Which causes princis by report of such fame
For their myslyuynge to have an heavy name
And thus for lack of virtuous diligence
Through falls luxure and Idelnesse
And upon flaterers the outrageous expense
Support of wrong oppressinge rightwisnesse
Where lesingmongers have an interesse
Whom to sustain when princys do their cure
God will not suffer that they shall long endure
Office of princys is to support right
His sword of knighthode fro wrong to redress
The pore releuynge to oppress them not with might
His old servants well preuyd not disdeyne
His hasty rigor and his vengeance sodeyne
Let mercy tempre to dome or he proceed
And god shall quyte him when he has most need
Here John bochas speaks again Idelnesse rehercinge how su^me men have joy
in one science and su^me in another
Mine auctour Bochas makes a rehersayle
In eschuynge of froward Idelnesse
That unto virtue may more avail
Good diligent labor and honest business
And so concludynge full pleynly does express
Every man reioyseth this sentence is not glos^d
^o do such thing to which he is disposyd
Su^me have joy by heavenly influence
To know the course above celestial
And su^me of knighthode do their diligence
To p^eue them silf in actys marciall
And su^me reioise in their intent fynall
In eloquence su^me in philosophy
Su^me above all to study in poetrye
The hardy knight is seruau^te to saint george
M^uynge of planetys sercheth thas^ronomore
Martys smyteth labors in his forge
Ha^ys of steel makes tharmoure
^ut the diuisoure by diligent entere labo^^^
(...) f^^ssh contriuynge out of the old entayle
Fyndeth new diuises of plate and eke of mayle
The laborere set holy his plesaunce
^o ^yl^h of land in time to sow his greyne
(...) his sede by yearly habundaunce
And that his plough labor not in vein
(...) y^ge his cesons of drought and eke of reyne
And poets to sit in their librarye
D^s^^e of nature and to be solitarye
^uch as men love such thing they undertake
F^ssh or foul to hunte with their hounds
Su^me of wulle sundry clothes make
By philosophers was found out first the grounds
And of all study they set out first the bounds
Caused poetys pleynly to conclude
Out of all prees to live in solitude
Logiciens delight in argumentys
Philosophers in virtuous living
And legistres following the ententys
Greatly rejoice in lucre and winning
Phesiciens travail for getinge
And of poetys this the subtle form
By new Inuencion things to transfourme
Poetys should eschew all Idelnesse
Walk by ryuers and wellys cristalyne
To hye mounteyns amorowe their course dress
The mist diffied when phoebus first does shine
Study in bokys of moral disciplyne
No thing coueite but let their intent
With moderate fode ^or to be content
Their cheef labor is vices for to fage
With a manner covert simylitude
And none estate with their language
By no rebukynge of termys dull and rude
What ever they write on virtue ay conclude
Appeyre no man in no manner wise
This thoffices of poetys that been wise
How malleus duke of cartage for oppression and tyranny was hewn into pecys.
When bochas had rehearsed of poetys
Their strange study and soleyne writings
And their desires of solitary seetys
In plesau^t places to make there dwelli^ges
Beside ryuers and holsum well springes
Which accomplisshed he began his pen auaunce
Princes of auffrike to put in remembrance
And while he did this besy diligence
Their pitous fallys to put in memory
First there came tweyne unto his presence
Their old noblesse appalled and their glory
Which as him sempte within a terytorye
Of auffrike bounds longing to cartage
Did first appear most dedly of visage
The tone of them was named malleus
Duke of cartage of auffrike lord and sire
His son also called cartalus
Whilom cheef prince and busshop eke of Tire
But Mallcus which held the great empire
Of all auffrike for his pompous outrage
Exiled was for ever out of cartage
Which caused him in heart he was not merye
But ay remembered upon his fell banysshinge
Gadred his people within the land of surrye
And in the field while he lay hostynge
Cast hi^ fully to make no tarynge
But in all have of knightly fell courage
Maugre his enemies resort unto cartage
Gauenge his exil his heart was set afire
And his intent more to fortefie
He sent in haft his letters down to Tire
To Tartalus that he should him hye
And bring with him all the cheualrye
Of his cite in steel armyd clean
His faders party to hold up and sustene
But when this bishop knew holy the manre
Of this purpos which ye have herd devise
He considred how that time of the year
Ordained was to do socrifise
Afetr the rites of their paynym wise
To hercules which in that cite
Above all goddys had the souereynte
Whoos feast was hold space of certain days
Which for to halowe he nedis must entende
And by the custum make no delays
But that he must thereto condescende
And lever he had his fader toffende
As in such caas than through negligence
Unto his goddys for to do offense
Whereof his fader had indignacion
The caas arectinge to unkindness
And thereof caught a great occasion
Again his son of froward wylfulnes
For princys often of furious hastynes
Will pike a quarrel causeles in sentence
Again folk absent though there be none offense
And su^me tunges venomous of nature
When they perceive that a prince is meuyd
Tagregge his Ire do their besy cure
With falls langage to make him more greuyd
But there is no poison so well expert nor preuyd
As is of tunges the hateful violence
Namely when princis list give them audience
The feast accomplisshed of mighty hercules
Al Innocent of double or falls menynge
This seide bishop of will not recheles
Came to his fader without more taryinge
Chaungyd nouther habyte nor clothinge
With all thensignes and in the same wise
As he tofore had done sacrifise
Anon his fader made no delay
Without excuse it would be no be^
Of hasty rancoure the silf same day
Made him be hanged upon an hye gybet
Law and iustise were both aside set
And tyranny most furious and wode
To do vengeance in trouthes place stood
Who can or may tyrauntys well descryue
Whoos marciall swerdis been whet ay for vengeance
Their blody thurst does through their hertis ryue
There erys ay opyn to here of him myschaunce
Their furious merth their mortal wode plesaunce
Their pale smylinge their laughter of falls hatrede
Concludes ever upon su^me cruel deed
They be mynistres to parcas sustren three
To untwine the thredys of folks here mortal
And very cosyns through hasty cruelte
Unto the wode furies infernal
Children to pluto of vengeance marciall
Which for their vices but they bear them well
Shall turn in hell on Ixions whele
Thus malleus fader most unkind
Like such a tyrant shed out his cruelte
As ye have herd and after as I find
Of furious heart and of old enmyte
By force is entered cartage the cite
And slough all tho in his hateful ire
That him before had exyled into Tire
Wrought after will and no thing after right
Began rob and spoil that noble famous town
Which made him hatyd in the people sight
For his outrage and great extorcion
Having no joy nor consolacion
Within his heart pleynly nor gladness
Save like a tyraunte the people to oppress
The people of cartage sore began to complain
Upon their missheef and desolacion
As bochas writes rehersinge in certain
Will is a stepmoder of wit and of reason
And where that princis have domynacion
And by falls pillage to riches clymbe up fast
Trust right well their lordship may not last
Their great power of worldly excellence
To their accrochinge of temporal richesse
When they be tirauntes may stand in no diffence
And froward will rules their highness
For what is lordship plainly to express
In this world here if it be dicerned
Love of the people when they be will governed
For tirannye and falls oppressyon
Causes princes to stand in great haterede
And what is worth their domynacion
Without love let preue it at a need
Men for a time may suffer them and dread
^is when that dread constreyned is and gone
^^an is a prince a man but alone
See an exaumpte how malleus of cartage
For all his castellys and toures made of stonys
For his oppression vengeance and outrage
^^e people of affrike rose on him all atonye
And ^ughe asondre his flessh and also his bon
Cast them plainly on him they were so wode
Unto their goddys to offer up his blood
The people dempt of mortal cruelte
There was none offringe so plesaunt nor couenable
Unto their goddys to ple^e their deite
As blood of t^rauntes which that be vengeable
Thus cruel princes make the people unstable
Of necessite which ought be compleyned
To wrek^ their wrongs that they be constreyned
^o here the end of malleus the tyrant
Which does to princes full well exemplefie
To god above how it is not plesaunce
Them to delight in no such robbrye
Nor pylle the people by no falls tyranny
Nor for no tales be hasty of vengeance
For all such thing to god is displesaunce
Lenuoye.
REd and considred this said tragedye
Shows to princes a myrrour full notable
How they there rigor shall tempre and modefie
Or they proceed for to be vengeable
For in a prince it is right comendable
Rancoure of heart of chere and of courage
For to differ till that their ire aswage
Their hasty ire their sadeyne malencolye
Their colerike fumys the furye vnrestreynable
Their vnqueynt fires with flame of tyranny
Their fretynge etyke of hate incomperable
Like bestyall tygres like lions vntretable
Ne will not suffer that infernal rage
Diffarre their domys till their ire assuage
The royal lion of mortal gentrye
Among bestes of force incoporable
Preueth not his power nor his regalye
Geyne bestys prostrat which be not defensable
And mighty princes should in caas semblable
For Innocents take mercy in morgage
Respitynge rygour till that ire assuage
The sparcle of vengeance is quickyd in pertye
By winds four fell and abhomynable
Blast of detraccion and blast of flaterye
Blast of falls rowners that forge many fable
And blast of bribours most vicious and culpable
With smoky slanders and felons falls visage
Causes ire of princes that it may never assuage
For which let princes of noble polecye
Beware of tunges double and deceyuable
Which with their venym infect each cu^panye
Their poynaunt poison is so penetrable
To folk absent it is myscheuable
So deep fretith their serpentyne langage
Causynge in princes their ire may never assuage
Noble princes let virtue magnefie
Your high estatys to make you merciable
For moral senke does clearly specefie
The trone of princes by clemence is made stable
Vengeance delayed to god is agrea^e
And hasty rygoure does outrageous damage
When humble requestys your ire may not assuage
How the substance of the host of himilcho duke of cartage going to conquer
Cicile dyed of pestylence and after him silf slain
After these noble mighty princes tweyne
Next in order with pale and deed visage
Tofore John Bochas hymilcho began co^pleyne
The unhappy fall of his fatal passage
When he was sent by auctorite of cartage
To conquer through his mighty puissaunce
The land of cicile unto their obeysaunce
They of cartage had an opinion
That it was lefull after their intent
Without title of right or of reason
Their teritories and bounds taugment
And for that cause hymilcho they sent
The mighty duke their noblesse tauaunce
Which of cartage had hole the governance
And for he must pass by these
Toward cecile this noble worthy knight
With him he had a full great enarme
Chose out of cartage in steel armyd bright
Their fone to conquer of very force and might
But fortune began at him so disdeyne
That to his purpos he neuir might atteyne
Ground and gynnynge of his distruccion
To be remembered shortly in sentence
There fill of the air a great corrupcion
Which caused a full great pestilence
Among his meyne by unware violence
And sodeyne myscheef that is upon him fall
He lost almost his worthy knights all
Dye all his people was slain in that moreyne
That but a few be left of his meyne
Unfortunate he turned is again
Home to cartage and they of the cite
All causeles of hasty cruelte
Has slain this duke as bochas does compile
Lo who may trust fortune any while
How Heynon duke of cartage was dismembered
aFter whoos death a man there began succeed
A mighty duke that called was haynoun
Which purposed for to change in deed
His name of duke by falls ambycion
And to be called thrughoute that mighty town
King of cartage and thereupon of pride
To find out weyes he felly began provide
He was nat^content a duke men should him call
But of cartage for to be named king
And like as his purpos that it should fall
Fro day to day the menys compassinge
How he might fulfill this uncouth thing
For to be crowned and regne in that land
And at the last this mean wey he fond
He had a daughter young and tender of age
Which of the people stood in great favor
And he him cast to give her marriage
To a young knight son to a Senatoure
Which in the cite was a governor
And that his purpose might be atteyned
Day of the marriage and time was ordained
And in his palyce cheef and principal
This said duke let make his ordinance
To hold a feast full solemn and royal
And with great costys made his purueaunce
Of sundry dayntees which that in substance
Were necessary in all manner thing
Unto the feast of a worthy king
He gave in charge unto his purueyours
That al were ready again a certain day
And to his feast came all the senators
Dwelling in cartage there durst no man say nay
And of his purpose to make no delay
Though his fraud was not apperceyued
He cast that day that su^me should be deceived
He conceived in his inward intent
He to be king and regne in cartage
The senators would never assent
To their custom nor their old usage
He durst thereof utter no langage
Kept him secret without noise or soun
And fully cast him to proceed by tresoun
The next wey he knew no better read
To his desire than pleynly to ordeyne
That of cartage the senators were deed
Than were he lykly his purpos to atteyne
For to be crowned lord and souereyne
So taccomplyssh his lust in all thing
And in cartage to regne as lord and king
For if the Senate were utterly destroyed
He should find no manner resistance
Whereby his purpos should be enclosed
Nor dare say nay to his magnificence
For in the poraile there was no diffence
And at this feast he cast him to proceed
All his intent to conclude in deed
His officers he made to be sworn
To help destroy falsely by poison
The senators of whom I spoke to forne
And that their vitayle and deyntes in foyson
And eke their wynes for short conclusion
Should with venym be intoxicate
Through all the palys and spare none estate
These officers had a conscience
For to accomplissh so horrible a thing
And secrely under great providence
To the Senate thereof they gave warning
And when they knew this mortal compassinge
Of duke haynoun to show all affray
They put in prudence the wedding in delay
Whereof this duke began have suspeccion
And this matter fill in a manner dread
Thought he would by sum collusion
Again cartage more mortally proceed
And began call to help him at his need
Of mau^^ayne a king of great renoun
With him by force to fall up on the town
Made him promys to his advantage
For to make fre distribucion
Of the richesses tresours and pyllages
Which that he might find in the town
For utter fine of his entencion
Was to destroy of wylfull cruelte
The famous cartage the mighty strong cite
Of all the thrallys in the town dwellinge
And such as were borne of low lynage
To strength his party this was his werkinge
He made them all by mortal fell outrage
Within the mighty castle of cartage
To keep them cloos of malice and envy
Again the cite him silf to fortefie
But all for naught the mighty senators
Thereof ware and of high prudence
Geyne his malice and all his false robbours
They made them strong and through their providence
In especial to ordeyne a diffence
First on their party to let the coming
Of Mauritayne the strong cruel king
And of assent they list not delay
But rose atonys by great ordenaunce
Their falls duke to venquessh and outraye
Him and his cherles they broute to vttraunce
Fill upon him with a great puissaunce
And finally procedinge of resoun
This was his dome by auys of all the town
First of this duke as it is remembered
He was despoiled his doublet eke unlaced
Joint fro joint hewyn and dismembered
And from his head out his iyen araced
And right as he had before compaced
To have destroyed his own mighty town
As ye have herd he received the guerdoun
Lenuoye.
THis tragedye does pitously copleyne
And makes a manner lamentacion
Of these mighty rich princes tweyne
Slain in cartage as made is mention
Causles the town save by thoccasion
That pestilence in his froward viage
Slough all his people that were borne in cartage
Fortune also began frowardly disdeyne
Again this rich mighty duke haynoun
When of malice began mortally ordeyne
The Senators to murdre of his town
At his fest by craft of falls poison
As ye have herd reherced his outrage
He was ageywarde dismembered in cartage
Who does vengeance vengeance shall atteyne
In high estate without excepcion
And who of pite vengeance does restreyne
He shall of mercy receive the guerdon
For right requires of troth and reason
Cruel princes shall have for their wage
Death like this duke dismembered in Cartage
Noble princes do your best pain
For to preserve fro rebellion
The common people which stand in no certain
With every wind turnynge vpsodoun
After fortune they change affeccion
Turnynge their hertys with trist or glad visage
Like as the people did whilom in Cartage
The auctour again covetous people
NAture that is content with a litell thing
The wise ware the circumspect goddess
Which under god in heuyn above regnynge
The world to govern is called thempresse
Mother of richessis the first founderesse
Which serched out by her arti^eris
The strange tresours hid in the myneris
This noble lady this princess most famous
Knowing of man the uncouth conditions
Saw by experience richessis were noious
In him teclipse the disposicions
And convey his inclynacions
By a wrong way virtue to set aside
How covetous was a full perilous gyde
For auaryce is to all virtues contrary
The gredy worm the serpent vnstauncheable
Man to be traisshe with promyses debonayre
At pryme face sote and a greable
Taught him of nature by craft most deceyuable
Through subtle serchinge as it were for the nonys
First out of earth to delue precious stonys
Of rich myners they search out the entrayles
To find out metals for worldly advantages
Contryued ships with their broad sails
By diverse sees to make their passages
And couetise ordained first viages
Caused princes to ride in lands far
Each again other for to gynne awerre
Of avarice began first these robberies
Awaite of brigantys and al extort pillages
Murdre slaughter and covert briberyes
Of old contryued furious fell damages
Wrought and enchened in all manner ages
Now in these days let set it at a preef
Falls couetyse caused all such myscheef
She was first rote of falls extorcion
To spoil the temple mother of rauyne
And sterer up of oppression
To take by force this was her doctrine
And as mine auctour does pleynly determine
And concludes in full pitous wise
Rote of all evil is false couetise
She is eke norice of tontek and of strife
Mastresse of murdre and wilful violence
Made men to i^parte body good and lif
Caused discencyon and disobedience
Grutchinge of commons withdraught of reuerenc^
By rigorous constreynt sodeyne rebellions
Rumor in realms unware subuersions
This froward dragon full of Idropsie
Whoos fretynge etik there may no plente feed
To staunche his thirst there is no remedy
The more he drynketh the more he has ay need
And the more tresoure the more he stant in dread
With Cantalus though he swymme in the flodys
In mygdas well pleyneth for lak of gods
This worm eke causes that men in their riches
Have dread of theuys a night in their walking
And they here on cofre bed or press
Cat rat or mous or any worm meuynge
He weneth anon within him silf demynge
That there were come with great apparayle
Sum uncouth pelour his tresoure to assail
The woeful soul stondeth ever in dread
And ay abides in labor and travail
And of the gods which he does possede
Falls in despair le^t they would him fail
Twene hope and dread there is such battle
Through entermynynge each other to confound
To be most gredy when they most habou^de
The next wey he knew no better read
To his desire than pleynly to ordeyne
That of cartage the senators were deed
Than were he lykly his purpos to atteyne
For to be crowned lord and souereyne
So taccomplyssh his lust in all thing
And in cartage to regne as lord and king
For if the Senate were utterly destroyed
He should find no manner resistance
Whereby his purpos should be enclosed
Nor da^e say nay to his magnificence
For in the poraile there was no diffence
And at this feast he cast him to proceed
All his intent to conclude in deed
His officers he made to be sworn
To help destroy falsely by poison
The senators of whom I spoke to forne
And that their vitayle and deyntes in foyson
And eke their wynes for short conclusion
Should with venym be intoxicate
Through all the palys and spare none estate
These officers had a conscience
For to accomplissh so horrible a thing
And secrely under great providence
To the Senate thereof they gave warning
And when they knew this mortal compassinge
Of duke haynoun to show all affray
They put in prudence the wedding in delay
Whereof this duke began have suspeccion
And this matter fill in a manner dread
Thought he would by sum collusion
Ag^yne cartage more mortally proceed
And began call to help him at his need
Of mountain a king of great renoun
With him by force to fall up on the town
Made him promys to his advantage
For to make fre distribucion
Of the richesses tresours and pyllages
Which that he might find in the town
For utter fine of his entencion
Was to destroy of wylfull cruelte
The famous cartage the mighty strong cite
Of all the thrallys in the town dwellinge
And such as were borne of low lynage
To strength his party this was his werkinge
He made them all by mortal fell outrage
Within the mighty castle of cartage
To keep them cloos of malice and envy
Again the cite him silf to fortefie
But all for naught the mighty senators
Thereof ware and of high prudence
Geyne his malice and all his false robbours
They made them strong and through their providence
In especial to ordeyne a diffence
First on their party to let the coming
Of Mauritayne the strong cruel king
And of assent they list not delay
But rose atonys by great ordenaunce
Their falls duke to venquessh and outraye
Him and his cherles they broute to vttraunce
Fill upon him with a great puissaunce
And finally procedinge of resoun
This was his dome by auys of all the town
First of this duke as it is remembered
He was despoiled his doublet eke unlaced
Joint fro joint hewyn and dismembered
And from his head out his iyen araced
And right as he had before compaced
To have destroyed his own mighty town
As ye have herd he received the guerdoun
Lenuoye.
THis tragedye does pitously copleyne
And makes a manner lamentacion
Of these mighty rich princes tweyne
Slain in cartage as made is mention
Causles the town save by thoccasion
That pestilence in his froward viage
Slough all his people that were borne in cartage
Fortune also began frowardly disdeyne
Again this rich mighty duke haynoun
When of malice began mortally ordeyne
The Senators to murdre of his town
At his fest by craft of falls poison
As ye have herd reherced his outrage
He was ageywarde dismembered in car^age
Who does vengeance vengeance shall atteyne
In high estate without excepcion
And who of pite vengeance does restreyne
He shall of mercy receive the guerdon
For right requires of troth and reason
Cruel princes shall have for their wage
Death like this duke dismembered in Cartage

Twene hope and dread there is such battle
Through entermynynge each other to confound
To be most gredy when they most habou^de
Hope vnasured with dread disespeired
Merynge in hertys make a mortal werre
When hope presumes with dread he is apeyred
And like a cowarde makes him stand aferre
Dull of his chere as is a cloudy sterre
Which darnat show the light of his tresoure
But ever to encres set holy his labor
He dare not touch thing he loves most
His cofres cloos be shet under key
Though he has much he make thereof no bost
Lest for his tresoure men would him werreye
Pleyneth for need like as he would deye
Feyneth falls pouert to spare his dispense
Oppressynge plente with froward indigence
And though his chestys happed be with gold
With iron barrys fast shet and closed
Falls scarsite governs his household
^h^ by none excess he is not undisposed
His indigent heart so streytly is enosed
^o herebus heir and yet well worse in deed
In gretest richesse to complain upon need
This herebus has of iron not of stone
For avarice vil^ a foul cite
Where as the whele turns of Ixion
Under the bounds of Thephone
Where zeziphus may never a day goo fre
But with his stone contynually trauayleth
And the more besy his labor leest avails
Thus avarice to virtue most contrary
Found among vices full contagious
Ever b^sy their restles stone to carye
Now up now do un with weary ze^^phus
Whoos endless labor braydeth on Theseus
Which held the bridell of fru^tles business
Condemned in hell to live in Idelnesse
Of couetise the cruel marinere
Is called Charon which with flegonte
By many a street and many fell daungere
Sayleth in the flodes of furious Acheronte
Under that derked and cloudy Orizonte
Where avarice ches whilom negardshipe
For tresorer his cofres for to keep
First to declare the labor in gaderinge
Of covetous men as it is in deed
And counterpeise how their straight keeping
Is ever meynt with importable dread
Sorrow at depertynge for their mortal mede
Which may be called of troth and equity
Of Cerberus the wakyr hedys three
The first head is vnstauncheable desire
Of worldly gods great riches to atteyne
The more encres the hoter is the fire
The second head is the dreadful pain
Which in keeping his heart does constreyne
Unware departing that suddenly does fall
Is the third head that greueth most of all
This wakyr worm that beryth these hedys three
Is called the worm of gredy couetise
Whoos besy constreynt restles perplexite
Troubles the soul in full furious wise
Which froward monstre pleynly to devise
Braideth on ydra of whom poetis seyne
One head but of / there gr^^^e three again
Ever at the tail of plente and richesse
Of custum follows grutchinge and envy
For he that has of tresoure great eichesse
Is seeld glad as for his party
Thus both tweyne stand in Iu^tye
The rich with plente hold him not appayed
And the nedy with pouertis affrayed
And yet in pouert is full great sekirnesse
Which is a tresoure that no man will assail
As mine auctour Bochas bears witness
An^^lates among the porayle
Lived in pees sure from all battle
Held him content with such as god him sent
When rich were armyd and to the werre went
Virtuous pouert stands ever in sekir caas
To watch his house he has full little need
But proud pompye assegyd in duras
For fere of Julius stood in great dread
But people rude hereof take none head
Such as rejoice them for to shede blood
In strange werres wrongly to get good
Stories old full well reherce cu^ne
Diverse studyes of folk here mortal
First how diogenes was content in his tu^ne
In which he made his lodging principal
And saw the course above celestial
Lived gladder among philosophers
Than king Cresus with all his stuffed cofres
And if men would unto mind call
The great myscheuys following in habundaunce
And think also how sardanaball
For all his trisoure came unto mischaunce
And how sophodius porest in substance
Had but a gardeyn full of lekis grene
And ^^ghtnought else him silf to sustene
This philosopher was ever glad and light
There was no watch made his tours
Full surely slept he all the long night
Having no dread of thieves ne robbours
In somer walkinge among the grene flours
And in cold winter full merrily and often
On dry straw he lay and slepte full soft
Cyncynatus a pore laborere
Feyed dyches to get his sustenaunce
Without grutchinge ever glad of chere
Both in port and in his countenance
Dempt he had as much suffisaunce
To his plesaunce as cresus king of lyde
Content with little nature was his guide
This poor man in his pouert assured
With litell fode and clothys but a few
Had hertys ese and gladsum pes recured
It liked him not over his head to hew
Which thing conceived clearly does us show
That Joyous pouert conveyed with gladness
Grutchinge avoided surmounteth all richesse
And if that folk could considre a right
Their pitous sighs their thoughtfull business
Their woeful labors their little sleep anight
Which they endure for worldly richesse
And of thabidynge the dreadful sekirnesse
Which thing peysed and called to memory
All erthely power is double and transitory
And by stories which been credible
To preue their power is not abidynge
But at a point slidynge and fallible
Whilom Mas^^ssa of Munydye king
That was so mighty by record of writynge
For fere of Siphax oonly his lif to save
Fled into mounteyns and hyd him in a cave
And there he fond full small vitayle
Constreyned narowe of indigence and need
When other deyntees in myscheef began him fail
He gadred rotes and ete them in his dread
Eke proud xerses king of perce and meede
Drank blood and water to stau^che his gredy thurst
Dread and traueyle gave him so great a lust
Yet su^me men would seye of adventure
They were compelled again their volunte
These kings tweyne such myscheef to endure
Maugre their will of necessite
For casuell chance raft them their liberte
So that the rigor of this sode^^e rage
Came in by constreynt and of no courage
But for all that folk in their pouerte
On great metys that them silf feed
Been also strong hole and fair to see
And also lusty preuyd at a need
Upright of lymmes their iourneis for to speed
As long lived the cause to express
Is oonly this they do none excess
To pore men the best medecin
Is due labor with moderate abstynence
Good air in feeldes when phoebus list to shine
Voidinge derke mystes that cause pestilence
Of heavy stomach they feel no violence
They not enrych lechys nor potecaries
Them silf to save with uncouth let waries
But folkis rich werkyn the contrary
Which in them causes maladyes strong
For their dyete every day they varye
With diverse metys and their sitting long
And with all this their appetites wrong
Take out of time which they may not endure
Which by custum oppresses their nature
And thus mine auctour shortly to devise
Sees how glad pouert stands most in sekirnesse
And of all evil he sees how couetise
Is rote and ground with falls extort richesse
Riot annexed engendringe long sikenesse
Thereon concludynge how moderate dyete
Set body and soul in moderate quiet
How Enagora king of cipre was by Artaxe^ses outrayed and put from his kingdom
Following in order the process of Bochas
As he remembers next in his writynge
To him appeared rehersinge thus the caas
Enagora that was of Cypre. king
His iyen derked by many fold wepinge
Because he had lost that rich land
Which he toforne had conquered with his hand
This land of Cypre as made is mention
Of ^^uers metallys is passingly habounde
Has of richesse great plente and foyson
And of his site like as it is found
It s^andith far south with many hillys round
And has also many co^meditees
Within his bounds of touns and cytees
Touching this cipre I can no more seye
Of which land Enagora was king
Till he began proudly for to werreye
With Lacedomonois their perty sustenynge
Geyne Artaxerses and ar their metynge
The seide Enagora was brought to vttraunce
Put from his kingdom and from all governance
How Theo king of egypt by artaxerses was driven from his kingdom and fled
into Arabye
Next Enagora came the king Theo
Of all Egypt long time possessoure
And to John bochas he began declare his woo
How fortune did her froward labor
And from him drough her friendship and favor
And suddenly through her iniquite
She kest this king down from his royal see
She list her malice from him not differ
Ne would not suffer him for to live in pees
But caused him for to gynne a froward werre
Again the said mighty Artaxerses
Wenynge thereby to have had g^^ate en^^^
Gadred ships and made a great arm^
In his intent to have ^et him on the se
To lacedomonois he was favorable
Sent them vessels stuffed with vitayle
Dempte of pride that him silf was able
With artaxerses to hold a battle
But hasty trust does folys often fail
For this theo was after anon right
Driven out of egypt and Iput to flight
Artaxerses pursued him so sore
Tofore his face he durst not appear
Fled into Arabye mine auctour seyth no more
Banysshed from egypt dedly of face and chere
And of his fate who so list to lere
He was depryued from kingly dignite
And by fortune cast from his royal see
How Amynta of Mecedoyne king had by Eru^i^^ his wife Alisau^dre / perdica /
and philip yt were slain
ANd among other their fates compleynynge
Trough fortunes dreadful violence
There came amynta of macedoyne king
And to John bochas showed his sentence
And to declare his magnificence
To alisaundre grauntfader in his life
Having four children by Erudice his wife
The first of them was alisaundre called
And perdica named the second
The third philip in Macedoyne stalled
King of greece like as it is found
Which in richesse greatly did habounde
And was eke fader this noble werrour^
To alisaundre the mighty conqueroure
And or mine auctour further does proceed
He makes a manner of digression
From his matter like as ye may read
And gynneth in order a descripcion
Of macedoyne the famous rigion
Among grekys writes in especial
Of seuyn prouynces it is the principal
And so procedinge ^e s^ith how that cuntre
S^^a^heth his bounds abou^e him enuyr^n
Toward the sea which called is E^ee
Forth by a^^^ya toward Septemtrion
And to Messie westwarde it goth down
And who that can by craft the coostys cast
To dalmacia the name thereof does last
In macedoyne he does also us lere
Of olimpus stands the great mounteyn
And in that kingdom is many great mynere
Of gold and silver like as books seyne
And on that hill is nouther wind ne reyne
For thilke mounteyne so hye does attteyne
That it may nouther blow there nor reyne
The king amynta of whom^^ spoke toforne
Had in greece many great battle
Olimpiens in macedoyne borne
And Illiriens to gedre he did assail
Through his wisdom he did alweye prevail
But with his enmyes while he stood most in strife
His death was shapyn by Erudice his wife
Mine auctour bochas of her does diffyne
She Imagyned his destruction
Because she had another concubyne
On whom she se^ all her affeccion
Day set and time to his confusion
Fully ordained at a marriage
He to be slain of one of his lynage
He had a suster called vryone
Which prudently espied the manner
Of Erudice and secretly allone
Goth to the king and told him all Ifere
And as the story in order tells here
Though she failed that day of her emprise
She thought fulfylle it in another wise
This to mean of her iniquite
Of her fraud and falls Imagynynge
She was in cause through her contrariouste
Of the destruction of their mighty king
For the conclusion of her falls werkinge
Was to have slain the king and all his line
She to have reigned with her concubyne
But when she saw she might not acheu^*
Her furious p^^^^s by none adventure
Her venymous malice upon her lord to preue
On other parties she did her besy cure
Enmy^^^^ and mys^ (...)
Again the king by mys^ (...)
With sorrow and trouble for to short his days
Night and day his life stood ever in dread
Him to be traisshe she cast out hoke and line
And who is he that or may take heed
Freely tescape teschewe as declyne
Malice of wymen when they be serpentyne
Se an exaumple in this queen Erudice
Void of al virtue and full of every vice
Alas no prince can be ware by other
To bridle their nobles with renys of reason
Such as commit alas both ship and rothir
Unto Sirenes to row them up and down
Throughout caribdys to their destruction
By craft of Circes alas they were made nyce
Blind to remember upon this Erudice
Which made Amynta to live in sorrow and dread
To rest in pees suffered him to have no space
In thought and trouble his lif he began to lead
Till by long process death him began manace
Yet or he dyed fortune gave him grace
His eldest son by wisdom to ordeyne
Called alisaundre his crown to atteyne
Thus alisaundre was his successoure
For Cathinenses began their rancoure let
Ageyns him for he with great labor
By their suffraunce came to his royal sete
And for to set this realm in quiet
First with athenys the mighty strong town
Provided a pes of hye discrecioun
And for to avoid al ambiguite
Of old debatys and of old outrage
First he sent into that strong cite
His son philip young and tender of age
On pees assured to lie there for hostage
And in that cite the story bears witness
He began to grow unto full hye noblesse
He was co^mittyd unto the disciplyne
Of a gr^^te duke called Epamynedon
Which to all virtue his youth made enclyne
For of this duke Iustyn makes mention
By a manner recommendacion
Tofore nor after as by his auys
Was never no prince more ex^ellent nor wys
First he commends his virtuous courage
His hye noblesse his virtuous excellence
And by descent he borne of high lynage
And into things concludes his sentence
Seith that he was of most magnificence
Egall to mars by famous chyualrye
And son to phoebus through hye philosophye
And bochas here does his style auaunce
Full notably with excellent langage
And seyth no tresoure atteyneth in substance
To thilke richesse auoidynge all outrage
As when there is by bond of marriage
^nyt up a knot atwene excellence
Of famous knighthode and of dame prudence
This knot avails more than gold in cofre
And is more glorious perpetually to abide
A mighty prince to be a philosophre
Which can by prudence all virtues set aside
For when to manhood providence is guide
And virtuous force is capteyne in the werre
Let men well trust that party may not err
This Epamynoda of knighthode susteynoure
Carbun^le of virtue as bokys tell cu^ne
Of gentle manners called the fomous flower
And of high noblesse a very worldly su^ne
Whoos knightly triumphs be so hye up ru^ne
To martis paleys with the blessed sou^s
Of famous trumpettys and golden clariouns
For he was called the bright clear myrrour
Of rightful quarrels the party to sustene
Of extort wrongs most just reformatoure
Ay egall judge of intent most clean
Which never could no thing but troth mean
Would of custum for hate nor alliance
On nouther party declyne the balaunce
And to commend his virtuous prowess
His prouyd trumphes his magnanimyte
His marcial actys his knightly business
In the getinge of many strong cite
As all his labor was for the comounte
Which to augment he would never cesse
Such joy he had the commons good to encrece
This was also his vsaunce evermore
What ever he gate to part it in largess
Of gold nor coin he set but little store
For all his heart was set on gentylnesse
By manly fredom and plainly to express
He spared no good it showed well in deed
His true servants to help them in their need
He kept not in cofres his tresoure
Of his nature he was so liberal
For to releue each manly soudeoure
Such as were preuyd in actys marciall
And for to hold his fest funeral
After his death his story makes mind
Through fre departing there left no gold behind
All his offices and famous dignitees
And great ^mpryses in his time wrought
Encresed fraunchises through Greece in his citees
With lib^^tees by his prudence out sought
For common profit and for him sylf rightnought
With great augmentinge of strange teritoryes
All this came in by mean of his victories
And among all his knightly excellences
By diverse auctours unto mind is brought
How all his life he studied in sciences
And upon eu^nynge set holy his thought
By manly prowess of death he rought naught
That was showed as it is well found
The day when he received his dethys wound
He was home borne unto his pauillyon
All his armure with blood steyned red
And on a couche by his men laid down
And began abrayde as he lay half ded
Sires quod he of one thing take heed
Has any enmy this day in the feelde
When I was wounded takyn up my sheelde
And when his knights had told him nay
By a manner of knightly reioysinge
He them commanded without more delay
To his presence that they should it bring
And thereupon full pitously lokinge
Full like a knight and with mortal chere
He kissed it and seide as ye shall here
Thou were my fellow in armies and my breother
That never would my felawship forsake
Sure and abydinge there was not such another
In every journey that I did undertake
To me welcome an end I must now make
After my death my soul shall have plesaunce
The to be kept yet for a remembrance
A fore his death it is put in mind
The same hour it came to his memory
To enquere he left not behind
Have we quod he this day had victory
Or in the feelde who has the palm of glory
His knights he prayed that day he should deye
The plain troth that they would him seye
And they him told plainly all the caas
How his party had won the feelde of might
And with that word he so reioysed was
That he his sprite yield anon upright
And so he dyed like a worthy knight
In whom is showed what avails in sentence
Noblesse of knighthode joined with prudence
And by the mean of his wise doctrine
Philip that lay with him in hostage
Began encrece in knightly disciplyne
Wex in virtue right as he wex in age
Whoos fader was by furious outrage
Called alisaundre as made is mention
Slain by his mother by covert falls treson
After whoos death perdyea in deed
The younger brother the story does devise
To the crown began lyneally succeed
Anon slain after in full cruel wise
Such falls murdre every man should agryse
As ye have herd first of amynta
Of alisaundre and of king perdica
How the proud tyrant Aman was hangyd and the Innocent preseruyd
THe horrible fall furious for to read
That follows after of the great aman
A full falls tyrant found in thought and deed
And was of birth a macedonyan
Which as the bible full well reherce can
Was cheef master who can well concern
With assuerus his people to govern
He was exalted hie in pride
To goddys people most contrarious
His hateful venym he list not for to hyde
But like a tyrant most malicious
Of wilful rancoure fell and despitous
Fully disposed and could him not withdraw
To destroy the jews and their law
To his intent he gate auctoryte
By his subtyl falls compassinge
Sent out lettres into each cuntre
Throughoute all perce by biddinge of the king
That hye and low within the land dwelling
No wight except that people all about
Should unto aman obey knele and loute
This was the biddinge of king assuere
When queen vasty was voyded for her pride
And hester chosen a maid most entere
Was brought to court with the king to abide
Which had in youth for to be her guide
A worthy Jew called mardoche
Within Susus a large fair cite
By whoos counseyle every thing she wrought
Passinge fair and of great meekness
And when the Eunukes to the king her brought
She was acceptyd for her great fairness
Unto his grace her story bears witness
And there cherisshed in especial
Above all the maidens in the court royal
And of al perce was she crowned queen
A pes co^maundyd through all tho regions
Duringe the feast that men might seen
The kings nobley in citees and in touns
And of this feast the rich royal souns
Came to the erys of simple mardoche
Which came with other the manner for to se
Tofore the paleys as he did abide
With other Jews in his cu^panye
Of hap as he kest his ere aside
He of two porters the counseyle did espy
How they them cast by falls expiracye
To sle the king some day of that year
Like their intent when they fond best leysere
When mardocheus prudently began feel
The secret malice of their compassinge
Of compassion he would it not concele
But made hester discure it to the king
Whereof conuyct they were led to the hanginge
As me seems a competent guerdon
For all that falsely Imagyne such treson
By which mean the seyde mardoche
Was well accepted to king assuere
Lykly also to stand at lybertye
Out of the malice and fell daungere
Of cursyd aman which make him no chere
But compassed in full fell manner
Him to destroy and Jews all I fere
This mardocheus the bible tell can
Withdrough him self to do reverence
Unto this tyrant the froward prince aman
Like as the statute commaundyd in sentence
Which thing tauenge by froward violence
This aman made of hatrede to be set
Before the pal^ys a mighty strong gybet
But who that cast him to do vengeance
And Innocentys for to oppress with might
And wif^ull malice tagregge their greuaunce
As god were blind and had of them no sight
Bu^ at the last he will of very right
Punysshe the proud for furious violence
The pore supporttinge for their long patience
As mardocheus by Innocent living
(...) mean of hester and her great meekness
Acceptyd was to assuere the king
The law of Jews set in more surenesse
Froward aman for his cursednesse
V^ngeable of pride the bible ye may se
Was hye enhangyd upon a galowe tree
Mardocheus of prudence and reason
The furious daungere of aman set aside
Preseruyd his people fro destruction
The tyrant hangyd for his froward pride
Thus can the lord his iugementys divide
When he sees time most mighty and puissaunt
Support the simple and punysshe the tyrant
Of the two brethern artaxerses and Cirus and Artaxerses slough his children
and concubynes and how they ended
AFter the fall of aman doutles
When he best wend have reigned i^ his flou^s
Tofore John bochas came artaxerses
Most renomed his time of conquerours
Which began declare his sodeyne sharp shours
With all the percellys of his mortal pain
Which that fortune again him began ordeyne
This artaxerses as put is in memory
All other princes excelled in richesse
Which in his chare famous of worldly glory
And with his throne of wordly hye noblesse
Sat in his time the story bears witness
Highest exalted that was of any king
That he should fall was it not an uncouth thing
Kings he had under his obeysaunce
An hundryd prouynces twenty and eke seuene
Son unto darye prince of most puissaunce
His fame dred more than fiery leuene
None so mighty under the sterryd heuene
Accounted was that time in werre and pes
As was this king called Artaxerses
He had a brother that named was Cyrus
Out of one stok came their both lines
But artaxerses the story tells thus
Was lord of greynes of oil and of wynes
And had also by diverse concubynes
An hundred children like as it is told
And fiftene over tofore or he wex old
Of both brethren the power last far
Duringe their time stood in full hye estate
Yet atwene them was full mortal werre
Again nature an unkindly debate
For thilke werrys be most unfortunate
When blood with blood let no man deem other
List werrey as brother ageyns brother
And finally cause why this werre began
Atwene these brethren as made is mention
Through which debate there dyed many a man
The ground of al and first occasion
Was only this for succession
After king darye regnynge in perce and mede
Which of them twain should next succeed
But artaxerses by a manner providence
Put his brother pryuely in prison
That he ne should make no diffence
Nor gadre people to his destruction
This young Cirus as made is mention
Was fast stocked and eke as it is told
That his stockys and feters were of gold
And though it be not remembryd in bochas
How that Cyrus escapyd fro prison
Yet also sone as he delivered was
Through perce and mede ridinge up and down
Gadred people of entencion
Through old hatrede his brother to assail
The feelde assigned they met in battle
Where cyrus proudly put him silf in prees
To show his manhood in especial
Sought his brother called artaxerses
And gave to him a wound full mortal
Without frenship or favor fraternal
That artaxerses his wound began so ache
Constreyned was the feeld to forsake
And Cyrus was than furious as a leon
His adversaries began mortaly to wake
But falls fortune full of collusion
Under feynt smylinge a mow began him make
Which caused alas that day that he was take
Before I woundyd it would be none other
And than presentyd to his unkind brother
And though this cirus had before be found
Young fressh and lusty and manly of his hand
By the constreynt of his mortal wound
He dyed anon for he no socoure fond
Than the two kingdoms within perce land
Fill to the hondes of artaxerses
In which after he lived long in pees
Thus a great space like a mighty king
All perce he held under his obeysaunce
By famous noblesse full gloriously shynynge
Having of richessys most fulsum habundaunce
And as it is put in remembrance
To more encrece of his prosperity
In true wedlok he had sons three
The first of them called darius
Arabratus named the second
And the thryd named was Othus
Manly princys like as it is found
And of nature like as the king was bound
Unto darye as it is made mention
Above echon he had affeccion
And for he dempt him able to the werre
By lyklihede of yerys young and grene
He cast fully his noblesse to prefer
Of hye prudence thus he did mean
His impotence to supporte and sustene
For he was feeble in perce to regne alone
He set up darye with him in his throne
Which was a thing strange and contrarious
Again the custum of perciens vsaunce
But he supposyd his son darius
Should in such cas encres and auaunce
His faders perty of natural attendaunce
And show unto him troth and kindness
His impotence to cherisshe of gentylnesse
But in estatys often it does thus fall
When that princes be run far in age
Their childrens love again them does appall
Showing no friendship save for advantage
How that they may rejoice their heritage
And in such caas when they wex strong
Think their faders live all to long
And artaxerses stood in the same cas
As in his story plainly ye shall find
By rehersaile and writynge of bochas
How this darye was falls and eke unkind
Foryetfull and had no thing in mind
How his fader the troth to reherce
Has made him egall with him to regne in perce
And to declare the first occasion
To his fader how the seyde darye
By a falls manner of rebellyon
Began in his werkinge for to be contrary
Which to discure I will no longer tarry
But with my pen in all have proceed
Here to discryue how it fill in deed
Artaxerses among his concubynes
It is remembered how that he had one
Which for to rekne wives and virgynes
Was fairest hold of them euerychon
Called artasia of full yore agone
And was that time her bewtye to descryue
Among perciens the fairest hold alive
And though she were Ironne far in age
Like as bokys list of her express
Both of color and also of visage
She kept her bewtye and her natif fresshnesse
Which was before for her semelynesse
To seyde Cyrus breuely to termyne
Chose long aforne to be his concubyne
But when this Cirus was passyd into fate
Which for his brother might not live in pees
Anon upon without longer date
She was take up for king artaxerses
Because she was of beutye peerles
After long time when he fill in age
She cleymed was by title of heritage
Of king dary by his faders live
Feynynge his cleyme by succession
And though his fader again it did strive
And thus began as made is mention
Of their debate the first occasion
For darye cast albe he bare it still
Her to rejoice again his faders will
And to accomplyssh falsely his intent
Of her to have full possession
Tafforce his party he made this argument
Cirus quod he as made is mention
Regnynge in perce the mighty region
And this story does pleynly determyne
For her beutye made her his concubyne
And after time when cirus was deed
Artaxerses his fader ye may se
Next him succedinge in perce it is no dread
List her to cleyme eke for her great beutye
And so quod da^ye she longs now to me
Because she is so plesaunt to my sight
By succession I will her cleyme of right
Thus king darye to his fader s^yde
He would have arthasia the fair
And therwithal artaxerses began abraide
And answered with face debonaire
My son quod he I will not be contraire
To thy desire but of affeccion
Deliver her to thy possession
Of his promys he after began repent
Cast him to make another cheuisaunce
And secretly his concubyne he sent
Called arthasia as made is remembrance
And through his sleyghty uncouth purueaunce
Unto the temple such menys he has sought
Of great Appollo that she in have was brought
Where she was veyled and made a preesteresse
After the rytes pleynly and the guyse
Of old paynemes by amaner holiness
And there professed for to do seruise
As their statutes constreyne and divise
Duringe her life it might none other be
She bound was to live in chastity
This thing was wrought by compassinge
Of artaxerses by froward ielousye
Whereof darye the young lusty king
Waxt almoost wode when he did it espy
And began compass of malencolye
Furyous rancoure and hasty cruelte
Upon his fader auengyd for to be
And his party of force to sustene
With him he had the story meketh mind
His brethren in bast an hundred and fiftene
Which to their fader were falls and unkind
Of all this noumbre there left none behind
That for this purpos onys list dissent
His death of one will they assent
Yet of this strange falls conspiracy
Artaxerses had a knowlegynge
Alt^o^gh the storye does not specify
How ne by whom he had thereof wittynge
For which in have he made no taryinge
To gadre meyne and make him silf strong
Him silf tauenge of this disnaturall wrong
For artaxerses like as the caas tho stood
Though it sat well to his high nobesse
To be vengyd upon unkind blood
For law nature decrees rightwisnesse
And all statutis dampne unkindness
Whereby this king occasion did find
Again his children because they were unkind
Su^me men deem how great multitude
Of many children makes a man strong
But thereupon pleynly to conclude
Virtue is cause if she dwell them among
But if their courage enclyneth unto wrong
And vicious life do their bridell led
The gretter noumbre the wors they must speed
A progenye borne of a cursed line
May through his froward falls infection
Outward by color of troth though they shine
Under appearance and simulacion
Infect and corrupt all a regyon
For it is said of full old langage
Fruit of sour trees take a sour tarage
This was well showed in artaxerses
That suffered his brother dye at myscheef
Bledynge his wound left him helples
Which to his name shall ever be repreef
Thus blood unkind unkindly makes his preef
For all the children fro his stok descendyd
Were cursed euerichon as here is comprehendyd
Their stok was first contagious of nature
The griffis froward though they were great i^ nou^bre
Which of assent did their besy cure
By falls treson their fader to encombre
But there is no shade nor no covert vmbre
So closely kept namely of falls gyle
But the venym will show out su^while
And thus the death contagious conspired
Of artaxerses since go full yore
Whereon to avenge his heart was so fired
Of furious Ire and Ibrent so sore
That he not could differ it ferthermore
But with his meyne fill on them anon
Or they were ware and slough them euery^^^^
He slough also all his concubynes
That were their moders of whom I told to forne
Suffered none to live of their lines
So of that lynage he has the wede vpshorne
Fond among all no greyne of good corn
Convict by dome when they were presentyd
To his death how echon they were assentyd
His clothys spreynt with the unkind blood
Of his children which he did shede
After whoos death in great mischeef he stood
And so in sorrow his life he did led
Dyed after in myscheef and in dread
Death quyt with death and rage with rage
Loo here the fine of his unwieldy age
Lenuoye.
THis tragedye aforne declares here
The great outrage of unkindness
Atwene two brethren regnynge both Ifere
In perce land as ye have herd express
Till division of all myscheef mas^resse
Gone enter in through fraternall hatrede
Which again kind destroyed their kinrede
The werre arose contagious for to lere
Throughoute all Perce of mortal frowardness
Of Cyrus death rehersinge the manner
How helples he dyed in distress
And how the noumbre of brethren did them dress
To sle their fader the story ye may read
Causinge an end of all their hole kinrede
King artaxerses with a froward chere
His Injuries and wrongs to redress
Slough his children their moders eke Ifere
Spared not one of froward cursednesse
By which occasion took a great sickness
After dyed in mischeef and in dread
Causinge an end of all his hole kinrede
Loo here a sorrow not perticulere
For through all perce ran the cursednesse
The crooked fame spread both far and nere
Of this vengeable hasty fell woodnesse
The air infectinge with sclau^drous blaknesse
To show the vengeance the contrarious mede
Of blood unkind borne of one kinrede
Noble princes lift up your iyen clear
And considre by great auisnesse
The woeful stryues the odious fell daungere
Sown in kinredys of wilful strangeness
Of all rancoure your courage do redress
P^isinge the mischeuys following on in deed
Of blood unkind borne of one kinrede
Explicit liber Tarcius.
Incipit Prohemium Libri quarti
Fruit of writynge set in cronicles old
Most delectable of fresshnessh in tastynge
And most goodly and glorious to behold
In cold and hete lengest abidynge
Change of resons may do it no hind ringe
And whereso be that men dyne or fast
The more men taste the longer it will last
It does corages renew again and glade
Which may be called fruit of the tree of life
So parmanable that it will never fade
To the five wits gretest restoratys
And to then plesaunce most cheef confortatif
For of nature when they be quyk and good
They of this fruit take their natural fode
Auctours heron conclude and eke assent
How that writynge of his kindly right
Does louyd personys and lyknessis represente
Of frendys absent seueryd far from sight
D^rkenesse of absence is cleryd with the light
Thus fruit of writings has his advantages
Of folk fe^of to present the images
Law had perisshed nadde by writing
Our feyth appallyd ner virtue of scripture
For all religion and order of good lyuinge
Takes their exaumple by doctrine of lectrure
For writing causes with help of portrature
That things derkyd of old that were begone
To be remembered with this celestyall son
God set writing and letters in sentence
Again the dullness of our infirmite

Writynge is cause that herto is remembryd
Life of prophetys and patryarchis old
How the appostles and martirs were dismembryd
For cristys feyth his baner up to hold
And writing shewethe tofore as I you told
Of confessoures the great steadfastness
And of virgynes the virgynall clennesse
Like to a tree which every year bears fruit
Showing his beutye with blosoms and with flowers
Right so the fode of our inward refute
By diligence of these old doctors
And daily fruit of their feithfull labors
Have our corages fostred and pastured
By writing only which has so long endured
The Epigrames whilom pershed had
Of prudent prosper that was so virtuous
And of Seneke the tragedies sad
The Stratagemys of vrgecius
Rebuke in vicis of noble percius
If in old writing had be found a lack
These seyde things had far be put abacke
Writing caused poets to recure
A name eternal the laurer when they wan
In adamau^t grave perpetually to endure
Record I take of virgill mantuan
That wrote the armies and prowess of the man
Called Eneas when he of high courage
Came into Itayle from Dydo of cartage
Three famous bokis this auctoure list compile
Eneidos first which that did excelle
In rethorike by souereynte of style
He drank such plente this peote as men tell
Of the stremys that ran down from the well
Wrought by tho susters that been in noumbre nine
Prowess of knighthode most clearly to termyne
For in that book he cast not to fail
With voice melodious for to discriue aright
The great conquest of rome and of Itayle
Wrought by Enee the manly trojan knight
Whoos veers notable give so clear a light
Through all the world as in rethorike
That among poetis was none unto him like
He wrote also this poet with his hand
By humble style other books tweyne
One of pasture the next of tilth of land
The veers conveyed with fete of metrys pleyne
By which three labors a palm he did atteyne
To make his name through dytees dilectable
Above poetys to be most comendable
Writing of poetis has set within his clos
Conquest of knighthode their triumphs and renouns
Read of Ouide Methamorphoseos
The great wondres the transmutacions
The moral menynge uncouth conclusions
His book deponto and with great diligence
Full many a pistle compleynynge for absence
Of craft of love a book he has compiled
Whereof Ceser had full great dysdeyne
Which was cause that he was exyled
To abide in ponto and never come again
And yet he did his labor in certain
In hope of grace his voutis to apply
To write a book of louys remedy
Writing of old with letters aureat
Labor of poetis does highly magnefie
Record on petrak in rome laureat
Which of two fortunes wrote the remedy
Certain Egloogys and his cosmographie
And a great conflicte which men may read and se
Of his quarrels within him silf secre
He wrote seuene psalmys of great repentance
And in his affrike cu^mendyd scipion
And wrote a book of his ignorance
By a manner of excusacion
And set a notable compilacion
Upon the life called solitary
To which this world is froward and contrary
And thus by writing he gate him silf a name
Perpetually to be in remembrance
Set and registered in the house of fame
And made epistles of full high substance
Called sine titulo and more him silf to auaunce
Of famous wymen he wrote thexcellence
Gresilde preferrynge for her great patience
Writing also remembered has how troy
Distroyed was since gone many a year
The slaughter of hector cheef pylere of their Joy
And for the party of Grekys wrote of Omere
Which in his writynge was particulere
For Tachille that wrought all by fraud
Above hector he gave a singular laud
Writynge causes the chapelet to be grene
Both of Esope and of Iuuenal
Dantis labor it does also sustene
By a report very celestyall
Sunge among lumbardys in especial
Whoos three books the great wondres tell
Of heuene above of purgatory and of hell

Negligence and froward Idylnesse
Echon stepmoder to science and cu^nynge
That I dare sey and be writing
Only ordained for our advantages
Ded were memory and mind of passed ages
And thus in cheef the causes before told
Meuynge the heart of bochas to writing
And to remember by many stories old
Thestate of princes in chaires hye sittinge
And for vices their unware falling
Yeuynge exaumple as I afferme dare
Of falls fortune how they shall be ware
His first three books by full clear myrours
Fully accomplisshed as bochas undertook
The cause of falling of many conquerours
Oonly for troth and virtue they forsook
For which mine auctoure toward his fourth book
Began sharp his pen to his eternal fame
Only by writing to get him a name
Mine auctour bochas that so much could
Begins here to make a process
Again the outrage of princes that were proud
Which were brought low for their frowardness
And notably remembers the meekness
Which stondeth hole in one and does contune
Is ay fraunchised from daungere of fortune
But he in manner does recapitle again
That fall of many that sat in hye stages
How they for vices stood ay in no certain
Came to myscheef for their great outrages
Remembringe first of priam the damages
And he lost ceptre and regalye
For susteyninge of falls auoutrye
The fall rehersinge of astriages
That gave his daughter whilom in marriage
To one that was called cambyses
A poor man borne of low lynage
For he should have none advantage
In no manner nouther in right ne wrong
By rebellyon again him to be strong
For he toforne had had a vision
How there should one proceed of his line
Which should him put out of his region
And cause him in myscheef to fine
But yet fortune could him undermine
That all his wisdom stood in none avail
For again god prevails no counsel
I^ needs not his story to reherce
Nor that manner of his unhappy chance
Nor the falling of Cirus king of perce
Nor of king Tarquyn for his mysgouernaunce
Though bochas here put them in remembrance
For as me seems it were a thing in vein
Thing onys told to tell it new again
And he list not now to be recheles
N^we again to make rehersayle
If the king called Artaxerses
Since it is told what should it more avail
But he proceeds straight unto Iitayle
To their stories and begins here
At marchus maulius a romayne consulere
Finis Prologi.
Incipit liber Quartus How marchus maulius wrought and did for Rome town /
And at the last he was by the commons cost into Tibre and there drowned
wHilom in rome there was a graete lynage
Called mauliois of renomed noblesse
And of that stok right fair i^ his yo^ge age
Ca^ this marchus the story bears witness
Which by process for his worthynesse
Was thr^ times by just electioun
Made consuler of that worthy town
Which to the common full greatly did avail
He dyuer^ times for the touns right
Faught in his days many strong battle
And ay prevailed through his great might
And in the feelde by a singular fight
Outrayed his enmy like as it is told
And took from him a rich bye of gold
Torques in latin in ynglyssh is a bye
A cercle of gold which that marchus wan
Brought it home through his chyualrie
And of Torques he was called than
Marchus Torquatus and thus the name began
He to be called the story tells us
Among romans Torquatus maulius
And he would often inpart good and life
For the Cite enter the field alone
And there conqueryd for a prerogatyf
Sundry crowns with many rich stone
Wan tunicles of gold manyone
For thilke time for diverse high emprises
Were crowns made in many sundry wises
For as Agellius makes mencioun
There were in rome de^ised strange croils
For such as had foughten for the town
As for their labor received their guerdoils
By a prerogatyf callid chaumpiou^s
Which sundry times of manhood and of might
Iupartyd their lives for the tou^s right
Like their desertys the crou^s took there names
For su^me of them were called triumphall
You unto knights for their noble fames
Other also called obsidionall
In romayne tunge and su^me there were mural
Eke other tweyne Naual and castrence
And al they were of great excellence
The triumphal made were of gold
Offr^d in triumphs to worthy emperors
Set with saphirs and rubies many fold
Upon the hedys of mighty conquerours
And when that rome was shynynge in his flowers
That crown called with braunchis boor^ed fair
In their vulgar thaureat coronayre
Thobsidional of which I spoke toforne
Devised were the bok^ does specify
Crowns notable wrought like greyne or corn
y^ue unto princes which through their chyualrie
Res^ued s^gys and saved the party
Of th^ym that were closed straight within
Through prowess a crown for to win
Another crown that called was mural
Was given and grauntyd by the emperor
To him that first wan upon the wall
A^ any siege and there abode the shoure
Fightinge alone In hope of some socoure
And he that might such a brunte sustene
Should of laurere were a crown of grene
Naual crowns whilom were ordained
For them that faught manly in the sea
When their ships were to gedre cheyned
He that of manhood and marcial surete
Upon his enmyes made first enter
Receive should in all the people sight
Korue liche a rother a crown clear and bright
The crown next which is called castrence
Was yeuyn of custom to that manly knight
That list auaunce him through his magnificence
Hosts assembled Iuparte would of might
^orne all other enter in to fight
(...) ^ilde eke receive his nobles for to queeme
^erryd crown made like a dyademe
The crown also which called was Ouall
Took first name of joy and gladness
Which kings princis in actis marcial
Osed su^tyme in their joyous noblesse
At sodeyne scarmysshes of casuel hastynesse
(...) ^han they venquesshed proudly in battle
(...) as their highness unwarily would assail
And for they were of power Inuyncible
Their noble crownys coriously were wrought
Of miitis braunchys which been imputrible
Enduringe ever and corrupt naught
For this word Oual if it be well sought
Is seyde of gladness as put is in memory
Ordained for princes after their victory
Another crown called Cynyca
Of oken bows was made round and pleyne
Ordained for them which pro re publica
Could in battle rescue a cetesien
And sle his enmye that was a foreyne
Of mighty oak he should for manhede
Cleyme to were a crown upon his head
And like as knights in marcial delites
For common profit did him silf auaunce
So for their noble victorious merits
The romayn people had a great plesaunce
With sodeyne crowns ma^^^all in substance
For to guerdon their knights most famous
Mine auctour record called agellius
Among other that did his besy pain
Such crowns manly to recure
Marcus ^aulius in manhood souereyne
Put often his life in mortal adventure
For in his force so much he did assure
That he deserved full yore agone
Of these sa^ (...) mo that one
And to encres of his noble fame
He did a thing both manly and divine
Whereby that he gate him a surname
To be called marchus Capitolyne
Which above al his names did shine
When he alone whereby ^e is co^mendyd
The Capitoyle from enmyes has defended
When they of france had take the eyte
Put all rome at myscheef unto flight
And laid awaite with a great meyne
The capeto^le for to take at night
By a passage that lay far out of sight
Under a roch called Carmenton
Their cave entryd into the cheef dungeon
They were shroudyd under a derke vale
With ordenaunce and mighty violence
Toward mydnight the wall for to scale
Most covertly them kepinge in scilence
Dempt pleynly for lacking of resistance
That they should in ^^gre tho withinne
Their hour assigned the Capitoile win
But the ges that were within clos
The wakir foulys by noise of their coming
Began beat their wings and up anon they aros
Where through this marchus in his bed lyinge
Began tabrayde and made tareynge
Took his harneys most furious and wroth
And to the wallys in all haste he goth
And him that came first upon the wall
Of very force without more tariynge
Down into tybre he made them have a fall
And all his felawys besy in scalinge
With sheelde or pauys or ladders up reisinge
This manly Mark shortly to comprehend
Into the flode made them to descend
Unto the death of him they were abauyd
For by his knighthode and his hye renoun
Maugre them the Capetoyle sauyd
And afterward rescued all the town
For the fortune in conclusion
Which that time did unto him fall
Capitolinus men did him after call
And for he was so victorious
Him self alone by this hye victory
This name he gate to him and (...) his house
Perpetually to be in memory
And registered in the consistorye
In their cronicles his name determined
With golden letters to be enlumyned
And the gees of whoom I spoke also
That so well kept watch upon the night
I take were and offered unto Juno
Solempnely with great torchys light
To whom also it grauntyd was of ^^ght
When a famyne made their store to fa^^e
They spared were and take for no vitayle
And thus was Mark a mighty conqueroure
Worshipped in rome all being of assent
But when su^me folk be set in great honor
Sumtyme it happens they hold them not co^^ent
With couetise their hertys be so blent
Fro suffisaunce above their degrees
To surmounte to higher dignitees
This maulius was fret in his courage
To gretter worshipes suddenly to ascend
Demynge so to have had advantage
And in him silf began frowardly pretend
In that cite all other to transcende
Beside triumphs which were to him reseruyd
Higher to clymbe than he has disseruyd
But there was one as made is mention
Called Camillus a lord of great substance
Which in the cite and in that mighty town
Above all other had governance
And as it is put in remembrance
To his gretnesse no man might atteyne
Age whoos noblesse marchus began disdeyne
In his heart he had a great envy
Which caused him by outrage for to err
Again Camillus which for his chivalry
The town gouernyd both in pees and werre
And for marchus would him silf prefer
Above that prince in worship and honor
First of the people he gate him great favor
And by a manner of conspiracye
He gadred hertys of the comonte
And drough also unto his party
Great multitude throughout the cite
And thus arose first the dreadful enmyte
Within rome the story tells thus
Atwene these princes Camyll and maulius
Thus first the venym atwene them two was ^owe
Of hasty hatrede by falls occasions
Which in the cite atwene hye and low
Caused of new diverse discencions
After the uncouth strange opinions
For every wight drough to his party
As they were meued in their fantasye
But for to stynt this outragyous error
And these hasty stryues furious
Again fro Tuscan came a dictatoure
That time called Cornelius Cassus
Which of wisdom blamyd maulius
For he caused such rancoure in the town
And for his gilt co^maundyd him to prison
Which was in manner hindringe to his name
And appallyd in party his noblesse
For a time began teclipse his fame
But afterward the cloud of that derkenesse
By common favor was turned into clennesse
For as it had be right for the nonys
In his diffence the commons roose at onys
First when they had among their great rumors
Myd of their fell hateful contencion
Shortly rebuked the worthy senators
Because marchus was set in prison
Which had been so helpelich to the town
Whom to deliver they diverse menys sought
And as I find euene thus they wrought
First they clad them in moornynge cloth^s blake
Pale of their facis pitously wepinge
Their beerdis vnsha^^^e their here to rende and shake
Like furious men up and down rennynge
Tofore the prison all the night wakinge
And on his harmys pleynly to be wreke
They began manace the prison for to break
And for to stynt their outrageous clamoure
The senators made anon ordeyne
To deliver him out of his soioure
Lose his feters and to break his cheyne
And when he was delivered out of pain
He list not stynt of hasty cruelte
Of proud courage auengyd for to be
And in his furious fell presumpcion
Maugre the senatys and tribunys euyrichon
Seide he would govern rome town
At whoos outrage they began disdeyne anon
The peoplys hertys from him were agone
And for his pride they by auysement
Assigned him to come to judgment
Forsake he was throughoute the cite
There came not one with him of his kinrede
He fond no help in his aduersite
Save a few came with him in deed
Of the commons full feeble at such a need
And thus alas he fond no resistance
Was vailable unto his diffence
But for socoure constreyned and in dread
Aweye he put his clothinge and vesture
And nakyd stood verily in deed
Showing his wounds which he did endure
At many scarmysshe and disconfiture
And for rescuse to speak in wordys few
The capitoyle to them he did show
And in supportinge eke of his quarele
Me^inge the people to rue on his compleynt
First to his goddys loud he did appele
To preserve him of that he was atteynt
The people about him with teers al be spreynt
That the Iuges astonyed were in deed
Where as they sat again him to proceed
But secrely he was led out of prees
To a place called frowmentyne
And there alas they were mercyles
His dome by rigor fully to termyne
Spared nouther nobles nor line
For the Capitoile out of the cheef dungeoun
Low in to Tibre for to be cast down
This was his end void of al favor
Which no man would redress nor amend
By cruelte cast out of all that tour
Which he whilom most knightly began defend
But what man can by writynge comprehend
The unsure socour fond in necessite
To them that labor for any comonte
Lat men behold that trust in worldly things
And namely them that be proud and hauteyn
Opyn their iyen cast up their lokynges
^o considre and se well in certain
Who trusts fortune his trust is but in veyn
And if ye list a clear exaumple find
Among remember on marcus in your mind
What might avail his nobles in battle
^ies of gold crowns of laurere
His rich platys or his uncouth mayle
His mighty sheeldes that shone so bright and clear
Or his triumphs song far and nere
Or his victories for the cite wrought
In his mischeef auayled him right naught
Here bochas writes in part against such as can not be content with suffisaunce
but usurp to high dignitees
HEre John bochas calls to memory
The strange Salaire the famous guerdou^
Of them that gate by conquest and victory
Honor and triumph within rome tou^
How it was used he makes mention
Ceriously reherceth the manner
Which I shall write if ye list to here
A vise was take first of estatis three
Of men of armies which that were present
That saw in deed the magnanymyte
Of him that shall have it by judgment
Of the clergy they must have eke assent
And of the Senate and people most notable
By preef soughtoute that he were found able
This prince also outher the capteyne
Which shall the triumph receive of very right
Within a charefull richely beseyne
He shall be set of gold boornyd bright
Fret with stonys which shall give a light
As phoebus does in his mydday spear
That no derkenesse about him shall appear
This heavenly chare shall for more delight
To show thencres of his knightly glory
Be led and draw with four stedys white
Through the cite in tokyn of his victory
And he shall have for a singular memory
In his right hand a palm of gold full shene
And on his head a crown of laurer grene
He shall eke have above all his armure
Poudryd with palmys a cote of purpyll read
In his lefthande his quarrels for to assure
A standard round declaringe his manhood
And all above set upon the head
The princes armies full rich of apparayle
In whoos quarrel he accomplisshed in battle
And of custum the seyde standerd shall
Be richely depent with read color
And so this knight this man most marciall
Shall be conveyed like a conqueroure
And yet for more encres of his honor
Upon their fete his prisoners euerichon
Take by his manhood about his chare shall gone
The most worthy fast by his side
All the remenaunt after on him lokynge
Echon of the poetys which in the town abide
Shall on him wait at his home coming
Dytees devise and of his conquest singe
And strange mynstrellys to be also record
Their instrumentis shall touch at a cord
All of intent to give him more courage
To the capitoyle so he shall be brought
And list of pride he fall in none outrage
Nor surquedye within his own thought
The most wretch shall of the town be sought
Which of custum shall have a staf on hand
And in the chare behind his back up stand
Gnotos Eolitos in Greek he should seyne
Which in our tunge pleynly does express
Know thy silf remembrynge in certain
Upon fortunys froward doubleness
On whom thou trust may be no sekyrnesse
And who that douteth where that it be thus
Lat him remember the end of maulius
What auailed his triumphs or his byes
Crownys of gold and peerlyd fressh tunycles
His high prowe or all his chyualryes
Synguler feightinge or marciall perticles
Newly remembryd or red i^olde cronicles
Peise his merits and see ^^^we at the last
How into tybre their champyon they cast
To his excuse auayled neueradell
Favor of commons carectis of his woundys
Nor to the goddys his lamentable appel
Nor remembrance of their fraunchised boundys
Teritories nor winning of the groundys
Which that he wan with spending of his blood
All knyt in one to him to stead they stood
Here ye may se how fortune suddenly
Cleernesse of fame can change to derkenesse
Glory to reproach worship to vylanye
And joy passyd to mortal heaviness
Swetnesse of sauoure into bitterness
And sobirnesse into furious rage
And old fraunchise to thraldom and saruage
For there was neither request nor prayere
That auayled to his delyueraunce
In cheynes fetryd dedly of look and chere
Abode the sentence of his fynall governance
Pale of face with trembling countenance
When he alas began mortally approach
Of Terpeya to the hidous roche
Of Terpeya this roche bare the name
After a lady as made is mention
Called tarpeya which fill in great diffame
Because she was assentyd to treson
To have brought enmyes into rome tou^
Whereof conuyet her story is well know
Under that roch she was Idolue low
This roche also was called Carmentoun
After a woman of great auctorite
Called carmentys which through her high renoun
The capitoyle made in that cite
And she fond lettris first of our abc
And cu^nynge had among her werkis all
Declare before thing that should befall
And on this hard sturdy roche of stone
Fro the capitoyle marchus was cast down
Other favor nor friendship fond he none
For all his batayles fought for the town
The commons hertys were turned up so down
Whoos love is like preuyd at assaye
A bla^e of fire now bright now away
The common people may hot and cry fast
As their hertis steadfast were and stable
But at a need their promys will not last
Of (...) corages they be so remeuable
To follow reason gerissh and vntretable
Lightly declynynge and is full great ruth
After opinions and no thing after truth
This mallius was of his trust deceived
Whoos lust unlawful was departed on tweyne
First when of pride he would have be received
To high estate which he might not atteyne
Where through the Senate began at him disdeyne
And the commons ay falls at such a need
Lest him in myscheef and took of him none head
Lenuoye
IN this tragedye men may behold and see
The perilous damages of falls ambicion
Of them that be not content with their degree
But would up clymbe like their opinion
To hye estate by usurpation
Which not considre the sentence of scripture
In a good mean men lengst may endure
Who that usurps to higher dignite
Than apperteyneth to his condition
In royal chayres for to make his se
And has no title of line nor reason
Through froward pride full often he is put down
For lak he sees not every creature
In a good mean lengest may endure
When dedalus taught his son fle
He had him first of hye discrecion
Fro phoebus hete keep his wings fre
And fro Neptunus cold congelacion
Menynge herby for short conclusion
That who that list with Joy his state assure
In a good mean he lengest shall endure
Remember the manhood and magnanymyte
Of marchus maulius which by presumpcion
Would have governed ^ome the cite
Maugre the Senate ruled that mighty town
Which turnyd after to his confusion
For he saw not such was his adventure
In a good mean men lengest may endure
Su^me in their grettest high prosperity
Of froward courage and furious mocion
In their great well by falls duplicite
Have a manner strange condition
Not to be content with plente nor foyson
By a falls etike which of their nature
In a good mean ne can not long endure
But in this earth grettest felicite
In hertys ese richest possession
With suffisaunce content for to be
Of worldly trouble teschewe thoccasion
Meuynge no quarrels causinge no discencion
Nor cleyme no thing which hard is to recure
Since in a good mean men lengest may endure
Princes remember in your most mageste
Envy of clymbinge causes division
Be of accord trust in no comonte
Which at a point is but decepcion
And specially fle symulacion
Ye may in marchus se a pleyne figure
Which for ambicion might no while endure
How Neptanabus king of Egipte was by xerses constreyned to fle his kingdom
AFter the fall of Marchus Maulius
Bochas anon began his style dress
Breuely to tell of Neptanabus
King of Egipte and of his great richesse
Seeing before in all his noblesse
By uncouth craft how he ne might chese
That in all have his crown he should lose
For he was cu^nynge in especial
And right expert as made is mention
In all the sciencis called liberal
And knew before by calculacion
How god would make a transmigracion
Of his kingdom and pleynly to report
The land of perce to grekys full transporte
For by king zerses out of his cuntre
Maugre his tresoure his cu^nynge and his might
This Neptanabus constreyned was to fle
Durstnat abide to have of him a sight
And into Greece he drough him anon right
Not like akinge but after old writings
Like a magicien he wrought wonder things
Upon fortune ferther to proceed
By his cu^nynge he greatly forthered was
And by his sleighty werkinge eke in deed
He was acqueyntyd with queen Olimpias
And so secre pleynly this the caas
That upon her men seyde by demynge
Gate ailisaundre the great mighty king
But how he fled out of his region
Of his ymagys nor his illusions
Bochas makes no manner mention
Nor how he wrought by incantocions
Nor of his subtle operacions
Nor how that he like a man by night
Whilom apperyd in the quenys sight
Save of his death bochas writes rightnought
Remembringe no time nor the date
How he and alisaundre to gedre have sought
The course of sterrys toward eve late
And how his son like as was his fate
Down from a bridge by full mortal wrake
Cast him bakwarde and so his neck brake
How Pansonoy duke of Lacedemoyne was exiled by them of athenys
tHis was his end and after this bochas
Began in have his style auaunce
Of pansonoys to tell the pitous cas
And all the manner of his woeful chance
Which was a duke and had in governance
Lacedomoyne there foundinge a cite
Whice of old time was called bisaunte
They of athenys that cite gate with might
And it (...) by their chyualrye
And af^^rwarde whether it were wrong or right
They exiled the same pansanye
And thus fortune through her falls envy
Caused that duke without more delays
In sorrow and pouerte for to end his days
How Heliarchus the tyrant for extorcion and oppression was slain by the
knight Leonydes
aFter the fall sothely of these tweyne
John bochas was moved of courage
For to reherce with all his besy pain
The great furye and the odious rage
Of heliarchus which by great outrage
Though he not was famous in chiualrye
He noyed all perce with his tyranny
Wherefore bochas began at him disdeyne
Cast he would only for his sake
Touch of tyrauntes moo than one or tweyne
And by writing again them a werre make
And in his hand he began a pen take
Told in order the perilous pestilence
Which they wrought by mortal violence
First he declares of fortune of right
Again tyrauntes furious and wode
Has full cause for to show her might
Tappalle their dignytees in which that they stood
Such as rejoice for to shede blood
Donat else but labor and divise
To spoil the temple in many sundry wise
And Heliarchus through his cruelte
And his contryued falls extorcions
Was mortal enmy to a fair cite
Called heraclye and many other tou^s
And by extort falls oppressiou^s
As the deed concluded at a preef
All that cuntre he brought to myscheef
Turnynge his grace and favor to hatrede
Mercy and pity unto cruelte
Fraunchise of people to seruitute and dread
Oppressed their fredom and old liberte
And all their statutes by which they were made fre
He interruptid of force and not of right
Which made him odious in every mannys sight
But to restreyne his great extorcions
Fortune this while was not recheles
For his horrible abhomynacions
She began tauale him this gods merciles
By a good knight called Leonides
Which with a felawe borne of that cuntre
Cast on this tyrant auengyd for to be
They dempte it was an alms deed
To set their land in quiet and in ease
Of a tyrant the furious blood to shede
His importable malice for tappese
Which to there cite did so great disese
And of assent with their swerdys kene
They slough the tyrant in their mortal te^^
Of whoos death many a man was feign
And specially of heracle the Cite
Dempte it was meedfull that he was so slain
To set in quiet all a comonte
Lo here men may the rightful guerdon se
Of tyrauntys which by their violence
To oppress the people have no conscience
How the vicious Denis king of Cecile slough his brethren and kinrede and
after exiled died at myschef
AFter this tyrant with a full heavy chere
And countenance pitous and lamentable
Unto bochas Denis did appear
Which in tyranny most was importable
Through his land hateful and repreuable
But for all that he began mine auctoure preye
Of his manners sumwhat to write and seye
Bochas lystnat reherce his lynage
Nor make no process of his geneallogye
Because he was with all his great outrage
Full of al vices pride and lecherye
Of avarice of ire and of envy
In Cecile held his royal see
At Cyracusis a mighty strong cite
This denis was cused of nature
Most malicious both of thought and deed
For as it is remembryd in scripture
He slough his brethren his cosyns and kinrede
That he alone in pees might possede
Without trouble or interrupcion
Of all cecile the mighty region
Among all vices bochas does specefie
He began draw into Idelnesse
Followed his lustys of foul lecherye
And often of custum he fill in drunkenesse
And thought it was most souereyne blissydnesse
Like as he had be master of fortune
To follow his lustys and ay therein contune
He wex right fat and right corcious
And his iyen began derke of his sight
That vnethe this man most vicyous
Ne might not well behold the days light
And of malice this tyrant again right
With help of robbours and of falls for^yns
Slough of his cite nigh all the Cytezeyns
His vicious life in order to reherce
Were contagious to the audience
His extort pillages wrought in greece and perce
For to write or tell them in sentence
Would infecte the air with pestylence
But I will breuely remember and discryue
The sacrilegies which he did his live
In venus temple beside Cytheron
A great noumbre of wymen he did call
Full well beseyne and by oppressions
He made his meyne unwarily on them fall
Despoyled them so that one and all
By his outrage and froward violence
They nakyd stood echon in his presence
And when he saw their shap and their fetures
And such chas out as were to his plesaunce
Robbinge the remenaunt took fro them their vestures
And let them goo without ordenaunce
And for this uncouth abominable chance
Their cite locroys aros with mighty hand
For his outrage banysshinge him their land
Another time also he did soiourne
Within the temple like as it is told
Of Jupiter son unto Saturn
There beholdinge his relics manyfolde
Saw amange other amantyll large of gold
Whereupon when he cast his look
That rich Iuell unto his use he took
And thus he said him silf to excuse
It was to heavy and to comerous
In somer ceson that mantyll for to use
Because it was to large and ponderous
And ouermore he allegyd for him thus
Since the garment forgyd was of gold
For wynterceson how it was to cold
And when he began away the mantyll pull
Than right anon this tyraunte deceyuable
Gave him another sengyll made of wull
Affermyd sothely it was more couenable
To other ceson more mete and agreeable
Concludinge thus for somer it was to light
And warm for wyntyr to were frosty night
Another time this tyrant eke also
Which was of heart most auaricious
Entryd onys the temple of appollo
And of his son Esculapius
And this tyrant fell and contrarious
Beheld appollo berdles that was old
And Esculapius with a long berde of gold
Quod Denis than as seems unto me
Here is a straunche froward conuenience
That the fader berdles should be
The son berdyd stondinge in his presence
Made anon by sturdy violence
To take aweye the berde which in his sight
Of most fine gold shone so clear and bright
Through Greece and perce where ever he did gone
In all the temples this was his vsaunce
The statly relics with many rich stone
And massy tables of mighty great substance
To take them all that were to his plesaunce
He spared none thus living like a thief
Till he by vengeance was brought to myscheef
Cyracusanys where he was crownyd king
All of assent there is no more to feyne
For his outrages and vicious living
They banysshed him never to come again
And so this tyrant vacant went in vein
About the world like a falls fugitif
And so at myscheef this denis lost his lif
Lenuoye.
THis tragedye yeueth a warning
To all tho that have domynacion
Over the people prince duke or king
To eschew rauyne and falls extorcion
Byt them considre how by thocrasion
Of foul pillage and froward tyranny
This said denis at myscheef must dye
First he compassed falsely ymagenynge
To sle the Cetezeyns of his royal town
His brethren his cosyns his kinrede not sparinge
Brought all his blood to destruction
In slaughter he had such dilectocion
Reioysinge ever in murdre and robbrie
Which caused him at missheef for to dye
To spoil temples was his reioysinge
Took all their tresours to his possession
Tables of gold with stonys fresshe shynynge
Eke fro other goddis the relyques he took down
Where ever he rode in any region
Whoos sacrilege and compassed felonye
Caused him unwarily at myscheef for to dye
In venus temple by record of writing
He did a foul froward abusion
All gentyl wymen that came there to offringe
Them he despoyled as made is mention
Let them be nakyd without excepcion
For which diffame and great vngentrie
He banysshed was and did in myscheef dye
Noble princes remember on this thing
Compassyd malice and falls collusion
Must have evil endinge and come to reknynge
Fraud aye with fraud receives his guerdoun
Have this in mind concludinge in reason
That all tyrauntys pleynly to specefye
Had here short life or did at myscheef dye
The auctour again presumptuous people and pryn^y^ holdinge them silf goddis
yE folk that been astonyed in your auyce
To see tyrauntys that been Incorrigible
Left from their sees that them held so wise
Thought their power was very invincible
Though tofore god no thing is impossible
Wherefore remember and do no thing marvel
With unware fallys though fortune them assail
For when tyrauntys been set in hye stages
Of dignitees regnynge like wode lions
Full hard it is to wrest their corages
Outher to tempre their disposicions
Worldly felicite so blyndeth their resons
As they to god were egall of power
And had fortune under their danger
Record of denis that often was affrayed
Bassaute of fortune like as was his fate
For vicious living three times disamayed
As his story remembers of old date
Next on the ringe now com^th pollecrate
With one victurbius tyrauntes of Itayle
Regnynge like w^luys toppresse the porayle
For when tyrauntys in diverse regions
Of surquedie catch an opinion
That their estatys and dominacions
Should ever endure by long succession
As god nor fortune might not put them down
But as they were in her estate royal
This world to rule to both two egall
Toward god they have lost shame and dread
Touching his guerdouns outher of Joy or pain
Indifferent atwene troth or falshede
Their lust Iserued nofors who laugh or pleyne
God is forgotyn at they dysdeyne
As both were recleymed to their lure
Falsely transcendinge the bounds of mesure
FOr which su^tyme as bokys specefie
God list suffer as made is mention
That fortune by a manner mokrye
Favors su^me folk like their opinion
Tenhaunce their power by falls decepcion
As she were set plainly for to seye
To serve their lust and durst not disobeye
How king pollicrate for extorcion and tyranny was hangyd till every joint
went from other
Record I take on proud policrate
Tyrant of Samoys beside these edge
Which sore labored erly and ekelate
Again conscience of furious cruelte
Tabounde in richesse and for to have plente
Of wordly tresours demynge that fortune ay
To his desires ne durst not sey nay
Fortune to him by many diverse sign
Showed outward great tokyns of plesaunce
Was to him eke right favorable and benygne
In all her port by a manner attendaunce
As she had been under his obeysaunce
To stuff his cofres with tresours lockyd fast
Of falls intent to mok him at the last
All wordly richesse his lustys did obey
And when he fond she was so favorable
For a ceson as she list to pleye
This blind gods unsure and ever unstable
Set him so hye up at the famys table
Of falls intent in his estate royal
When he sat highest to make him have a fall
For in him silf of pride he began to deem
How that he stood most in prosperity
Of them that weryd crown or dyademe
Above all other in most felycite
And thus enhauncyd in his royal ^ee
Thought him egall with goddys in comune
Far from all daungere of fate or fortune
And for tatempte of goddis the power
And of fortune the variaunt doubleness
He took a ringe of gold full bright and clear
Therein a rubye of excellent redness
Sekinge occasion of new heaviness
Which never before had know of such thing
Into the se anon he cast his ringe
Disespyred again to recure
For he dempte it was an impossible
But right anon fisshers of adventure
Like a merueyle very incredible
Among the wawes hidous and horrible
Cast in their nettis if it would avail
Taking afysshe the ringe in his entrayle
Which was presented at a solempnite
To pollicrate with great reverence
When he sat crowned in his most dignite
At a feast of famous excellence
The fisshe undone anon in his presence
Myd thentrailes his keruer fond the ringe
Of adventure and took it to the king
Which dempt of pride and high presumpcion
That Neptunus god of the salt see
Had of his ringe made restitucion
And durst not offend his mageste
Whereupon a fantasye caught he
Nouther heavenly gods no Fortune blind of sight
Were both vnhardy tatempte again his might
His great outrage to god was not unknow
And his presumption fortune has well espied
For which she made aduersite be her bow
And of her whele the spokys she has so guyed
Whereon he sat most richely magnefyed
That he unwarily down from his hye noblesse
Was brought full low in sorrow and wretchidnesse
In wordly joy no thing is more to dread
Than when fortune is most blandisshinge
And that her flatrye is f^et with wordly mede
High on her whele to make folys singe
Than of her nature sorrow she does bring
Witness of princes of old or new date
And record also of proud pollycrate
Su^tyme he sat hye on fortunes whele
Of prosperity with bemys clear shynynge
Whoos temple is made of glass and not of stele
His castle is unwarily dissoluynge
Though it be fresse outward in showing
Unsure to stand on and brotyll for to abide
Whoo trusts most / most lykly is to slide
The geryssh queen of chere and face double
Withdrough her favor and began to varye
Fro pollicrates set him in sorrow and trouble
Wexe again him maliciously contrary
Causinge Orontes constable with king darye
Maugre this tyrant in most his cruelte
To gynne a werre on Samoys the cite
And when his glory was most clear of light
And his noblesse shone highest at the full
Fortune began through her chaungeable might
Of his prosperyte the feathers to pull
And than at erst his courage began to dull
And all his pride unwarily for tapall
When he was spoiled of his richesse all
First when Orontes his cuntre began assail
To pollicrate of sodeyne adventure
Outrayed was and takyn in battle
By a full perilous mortal disconfiture
Thus fortune could bring him unto her lure
Through her unware ugly falls disdeynes
Led into prison and bond in strong cheynes
The people dwelled within his region
Reioysed in heart to se him suffer pain
His tirannye his false extorcion
Caused that they did at him disdeyne
For of his death no man list complain
Men through the world be glad and have plesaunce
To se a tiraunte brought unto myschaunce
Four things his tourmentys did augment
Sodeyne departinge from his old richesse
And that he saw each man in his intent
Of his mischeef have so great gladness
Hangyd he was mine auctoure bears witness
And henge so long in tempest reyne and thundre
Till every Joint from other went asundre
To beestys wild and folkys ravenous
Nakyd he henge such was his adventure
To all folks he was so odyous
Had in despyte of every creature
At his departinge denied sepulture
Guerdon for tyrauntys vengeable and recheles
That cannot suffer the people to live in pes
Thus may tyrauntes excede far their bounds
By falls outrage full well resemblyd be
To cruel wulues or to furious hounds
Fret with an etyke of gredy cruelte
To staunch their hungre avails no plente
Which for their surfetys froward for to read
With pollycrates in hell shall have their mede
How the tyrant alisaundre llough his philosopre Calistenes with other for
saying truth
Among all stories to tell the pitous cas
Of woeful pleyntifs that put the^ sifl in pres
With wepinge iyen mine auctor John bochas
Was meuyd in heart not to be recheles
T^ write the fall of calistenes
Which alas as it is remembrid
Was for his truth on pecys all dismembryd
For when bochas his story began aduert
^e dempte anon in his fantasy
No man had so hard a stonen heart
That might of right his iyen keep dry
To se the process of his tormentrye
Yet began mine auctour his woeful pen profre
To write the wrong done to this philosophre
This Calistenes in youth right well thewed
His grene age promotyd to doctrine
By influence of heavenly fate adewed
Greatly to profit in moral disciplyne
Dysposyd of nature by grace which is dyuine
To conquer as bokys specefye
The noble surname of philosophy
Of his meritys famous and notable
Philosophye did her besy pain
To give him souke because that he was able
The sore milk of her brestys tweyne
Most precious licour who might thereto atteyne
For bawme is none the virtue well declared
Of worldly richesse may be thereto comparyd
This precious pyment is you unto no folys
Above all licours it does so far excelle
Whoos orygynall sparinge in the holy scolys
Of athenys as famous bokys tell
For of philosophy there sprange out first the well
Where calystenes the experience is well couth
With fulsum plente was fostred in his youth
Though he was borne of a good lynage
Virtue made him more high up for to assende
To be enhaunced for noblesse of courage
More than for blood who can comprehend
For philosophers and clerkys more commend
The moral virtues entresoured by writings
Than all the tresours of worldly crowned kings
Of gentle stockys rekne out the issues
That be descendyd down from a royal line
If they be vicious and void of all virtues
And have no tarage of virtuous disciplyne
With temporal tresoure though they florissh and shine
As for a time sittynge on hye stages
Without virtue they are but deed images
For though princes have conquered by bataile
This world in roundnesse by their chiualrye
What may their triumphs or noblesse avail
Without that virtue by right their titles guye
To be compared unto philosophy
For philosophers apply all their ententys
To know heuene and ^ours of ^lementys
They set no store of things transitorye
Nor of fortunes expert doubleness
To heavenly things is set all their memory
How the seuene planetys in their course them dress
Meuynge their sterrys sparkynge in their brightness
With reuolucions of the speris nine
Mothers of Musyke as auctours determyne
And in the noble tweyne famaus housys
Flowringe in Greece richest of euerychon
Called by old date the fair true spousys
Of philosophers many mo than one
In athademie and athenys shone
The bright lanternys of most reuerencis
This world tenlumyne by lyberall sciencis
And among ^ther this Calistenes
Was in his youth put for to scoleye
In the two scoles of prudent Socrates
And of plato which that bare the key
Of secre mysteries and of divine Ideye
In which two scolys of great habilite
Was none profited half so much as he
These old clerks these two philosophers
Were in tho days for doctrine souereyne
Called in this world the rich precious cofres
And tresours that kept the chestys tweyne
Amyd their breestys wherein god did ordeyne
Most clear possession put in their depose
Of all sciencys under a key close
This calistenes scoler and auditour
Of aristotle's by cu^nynge co^queringe
The noble gemine and the most precious flower
Of philosophy all flouris surmountinge
Wherthrough he was chosyn in his lyuinge
As his master list for him provide
On Alisaundre tawayte and abide
For alisaundre of kings most entere
And most worthy to speak of hye prowess
Did aristotle's humbly requere
To provide and do his business
By expert knowing and auysenesse
To send him one which of philosophy
Might by good counseyle his conquest magnefie
To write also his triumphs digne of glory
And to remember his actys marciall
Put his palmys of knighthode in memory
And to direct in especial
His royal noblesse in virtue moral
That none e^roure be seen here nor there
In him that should all the world conquer
But it fyl so of knightly adventure
That of fortunes high promocion
That he by arms proudly began recure
Of perce and me^de the mighty region
Brought king darie unto subjection
Gate hole his tresoure that noman might express
To account the noumbre of his great richesse
Which unsure tresoure and slydinge habundaunce
With wastinge shadows of goddys transitorye
In surquedous pride began so his heart auaunce
By falls ambycion and outrayous veynglorye
That made him lose mind and eke memory
To know of nature he was no man mortal
But like to gods that were celestyall
Above the palm of old conquerours
Knightly triumphs conquestys marcial
He usurped by title of his labors
To heavenly goddys for to be egall
And through his meritis most Imperial
He began presume by line he was allied
With the seuene gods for to be deified
Through all his paleys and his royal hall
A law he set upon pain of life
That men of custu^ should him name and call
This worldys monarke not mortal nor passif
Son to Jupiter for a prerogatyf
Which had the earth as god most of puissaunce
Conqueryd by sword unto his obeysaunce
By full auys purposed for the nonys
Of pompous outrage and surquedous intent
Full great tresoure of gold and precious stonys
Unto the temple of Jupiter he sent
That the bissh^ppes and preestis should assent
Him to receive at his home coming
Like as a god and no mortal thing
Thus by extort dread and usurped might
Was first brought in full Idolatrye
Causinge princys to receive again night
Goodly reverence of froward mawmetrye
But when Calistenes this error did espy
In alisaundre he besily did entende
This false opinyon to correct and amend
But five causes notable to reherce
This Calistenes in especial
Though he was king of Egypt meede and perce
He preuyd of reason he was a man mortal
His birth eke erthely and not celestyall
Fader mother as of their natures
Borne for to dye like other creatures
His fader philyp of macedoyne king
His mother called Olimpidiades
Worldly folk and heavenly no thing
With kings quenys vpset by hye encres
Yet again death they could have no reles
Laws of nature maugre their will tobeye
Not like gods but oonly borne to dey^
Kind made them subget to sundry passions
And many uncouth diverse infirmytees
Now glad now heavy of conditions
Following the form of their humanitees
But of their falls usurped deytees
I can not sey save dread and flaterye
Wrongly in earth did them deifye
Eke alisaundre following ever his lust
For all his lordship and his great might
He suffered passions of hungre and of thurst
Now hole now sike now heavy now light
Whoos enterchaungynge in every mannys sight
Clearly showed clerkys reherce can
He was no god but like a mortal man
It fill onys mine auctour does compyle
In a great hete long or he was old
He bathyd him silf in the flode of nyle
Where of fortune he suddenly took cold
His poorys opned on pertyes many fold
Lay long after his story bears witness
Or he was cured of that great syknesse
But at the last by craft of medicyne
Delivered he was of that infirmite
No thing amendyd by his power divine
By might of Juno nor Jupiters poust^
Nor by his own usurped deite
For by the passions which he did endure
It showed he was a dedly creature
Of him also it is made mention
He had a custum to fall in dronkenesse
Through violence lost often his reason
Than of ire and furious hastynesse
He would smite and hurt in his woodnesse
Which tokyns were pleynly to termyne
In his person not heavenly nor divine
When the philosopre called Calystenes
Began first considre all these conditions
In alisaundre he put him silf in prees
Void of dissymulinge and dilacions
For to refourme such falls ambicions
Of goodly honor which men did on them feyne
And from all vices his corages to restreyne
In this purpos as any center stable
He cast him fully of true entencyon
To correct all that was repreuable
Vsyd in his person or in his region
Troth gave him heart like a champion
To tell the king in his estate royal
He was no god but a man mortal
For which the king of indignacion
Caught a quarrel again Calystenes
Put upon him unjustly falls treson
Only to sle his master causeles
And for tateynt him before all the prees
Seyde how he had of his Iniquyte
Conspired again his royal mageste
And feyned also the silf same time
How he had made a conspiracion
Again his lord by an horrible crime
Interuptinge the religion
Of his divine institucion
That in such cas there was no better read
But Calystenes by law must be deed
And to prolonge of his death the pain
Upon a board he was laid alonge
His fet smet of and his handys tweyne
His iyen rent out were not his peynes strong
Thus can tyrauntys when they list do wrong
Sle philosophers without any ruth
Which spared not for to sey them truth
This cruel vengeance might not suffice
But alisaundre more to encres his woe
Did cut his lyppes in full cruel wise
His nose thrilles his cries eke also
And with the body he bad men should goo
Tofore his host as it is remembered
To show the trunk how it was dismembered
In a cave deep and wonder low
Solitarye derkyd all the bounds
After the peynes he made him to be throw
The place stuffed with wood berkinge hounds
Of falls intent to rende his blody woundys
Till Lysimachus of great compassion
To short his torment gave him poison
Who red ever of tormentys more terryble
O alisaundre thou ought be ashamyd
To sle thy clerk with peynes so horrible
For thy vices because he has the blamed
Thy royal name thereby is diffamyd
But ever tyrauntes when them list be wode
Of Innocents rejoice to shede blood
Again this knight gentle Lysimachus
Because he had of them compassion
King alisaundre was malencolious
Without cause title or affection
Let shet him up with a feers lion
Void of all help for to be socoured
Of entencion he should be devoured
But Lysimachus quyt him like a knight
Again this lion in the same place
Ran feersly on him and of his marciall might
Out of his head his tunge he did arace
Reconsyled to the kings grace
Because that he so knightly has him borne
Better cherisshed than ever he was toforne
Another knight that called was clytus
F^mous in armies for his chiualrye
One the grettest of the kings house
And most co^mendyd of prudent polycie
Most famylier as bokys specefye
About the king as it was often preuyd
To tempre his courage when he was agreuyd
The king and he walkinge hand by hand
Within the paleys being in presence
Princys dukys of many diverse land
Where they began by notable eloquence
Remember of armies the notable excellence
Of conquerours and other knights old
And every man about his tale told
Among which clytus the gent^l knight
Began to commend and greatly magnefie
Philip macedoyne as him ought of right
Both of wysdom and his chyualrye
Till alisaundre had thereat envy
Began disdeyne of furious cruelte
That any should be co^mendyd more than he
Caught occasion of ire and falls hatrede
Again his knight that was to him most true
With a sharp sword unwarily made him blede
His heart blood hot and read of hue
By his sides raylinge down of new
Thereby to preue this story tell can
He was no god nor reasonable man
Thus in princis furious and cruel
Men may clearly an euydence se
How that lordship is not perpetuell
But full of change and mutabilite
Of ^here now friendly now sodeyne enmyte
Record on clytus most in the kings grace
Unwarily slain and did no traspace
Was he worthy to be deyfyed
This alisaundre most double of his courage
Or was he worthy to be stellefyed
This furious prince for his fell outrage
That slough his friends in his mortal rage
Thus fare tyrauntis when they list be wode
To seek occasion for to shede blood
Calisten slain for moral disciplyne
And lysimachus for his compassion
Eke this tyraunte of falls gredy rauyne
Slough gentle clytus again truth and reason
As ye have herd for co^mendacion
Of king philip this story well conveyed
Who trusts tyrauntys shall sonest be deceyuyd
Lenuoye.
THis tragedye of calistenes
Declares us by notable remembrance
He was with plato and old Socrates
In his youth put under governance
Drank of the milk of plentuous habundaunce
Of their two scolys ever deuoyde of sloth
Last by alisaundre dismembryd for his troth
First he was sent by aristotle's
For tawayte by prdent purueaunce
On alisaundre list he were recheles
By presumpcion in his royal puissaunce
To take upon him by goodly attendaunce
Which he withstode alas it was great ruth
To be so slain because he said truth
Who with tyrauntys list put him silf in prees
To have their favor and stormy acquaintance
He must flater and sage dou^les
Be double of heart with feyned countenance
With chere contreued done his obseruaunce
For feithfull menynge slain and that was ruthe
In calistenes because he said truth
Noble princes your subgettes keep in pes
Be not to hasty for to do vengeance
For to tirauntis that be merciles
God sent short life and sodeyne myschaunce
Who seyth troth have no displesaunce
Prente in your heart how it was great ruth
That Calistenes was sleyne for his truth
How Alisaundre king of Pyrothe auenturynge to pass the flode of Acheronte /
there at his bak by his most trusty was dedly woundyd
AFter the compleynt of Calistenes
Slain tirauntly and did no trespass
Came alisaundre king of pyrothes
His wounds bledynge unto John Bochas
To him declared how he drowned was
In acheronte a river of great fame
Beside a town pandosia was the name
And as it is remembered and I told
Of this notable mighty strong cite
It was in greece Bylt of days old
And after pirrus called pyrothe
Where as the king held his royal se
And as bokys also determyne
This Alisaundre came of the same line
Of whoos kinrede is made pleyne mention
Son to achillus was king pirrus
And next in order by succession
Fader to elysaundre was Neptolonyus
Which had also mine auctoure tells thus
A full fair daughter the story ye may se^^
Olimpiades of macedoyne queen
And she was weddyd to philip Macedo
Whilom mother this queen of most renoun
To alisaundre the story tells so
Which all the world brought in subjection
Whoos fader philip of great affection
Let crown the brother of olimpiades
Called alisaunder to regne in Pirothes
To whom philyp for his great beutye
Because he was so fair a creature
Had such affection and specialte
As it is remembryd in scripture
Of falls foul lust again nature
As seyth Bochas I can him not excuse
Vnlefully he did his beutye use
And by mean of that horrible deed
Which to reherce is to foul a thing
This said philyp in Bochas thus I read
In Epirothes he made him to be king
And of extorsion by record of writing
Causeles from thens he did enchace
The king Arabba tho regnynge in that place
And it fill after the story tells so
Of this alisaundre by cerious rehersayle
Upon the death of philip macedo
With a great host came into Itayle
Supposinge greatly for to avail
To occupye after his proud intent
Holy the boundys of all the occident
And though so be that fortune be chaungeable
Double also by course of her nature
At his gynnynge he fond her fouourable
Made him twyes proudly to recure
Geyne them of Luke to their disconfiture
To have the field and maugre all their might
Of very force to put them unto flight
Again Itayle when he began this werre
Fully in purpos the romans to assail
Of hye presumpcion proceed he began so far
With many prince that was in his battle
To know before by certain dyuynayle
Of his conquest the boundys for to cast
And of his life how long it should last
And in the temple of Jupiter the great
By dyuynours that expert were and old
Serving this god within the land of Crete
This was the answer which they have him told
And it affermed by toknes many fold
How that he not should eschew the drefull date
Over the day assygned to his last sat
And they also assigned a place
Thereby to have knowlegynge more clear
Under a cute long and large of space
Called Pandosia and for to go more nere
By acheronte a famous great riuere
Told him plainly and could no ferder seie
Of necessite there he must nedys deie
And though it were an erneste and no iape
Of god ordained not to be s^t aside
He thought of wysdom his destyne to escape
And otherwise for him silf provide
Cast in greece no longer to abide
Wenynge this ryu^re nor that fair cite
Save in greece should nowhere else be
And for to set him silf in assurance
Of intent to eschew his destyne
In to three batayles departing his puissaunce
Came to Itayle tofore luke the cite
They with help of samoys the contre
with a great power came out anon right
Slough al his knights and put him unto flight
At the back they pursued him so nere
That his enemies almoost were on him fall
Unto a bridge broke with the riuere
And ouerturned with his plankes al
And acheronte men that river call
As was told him by a certain knight
Which rode before him the river in his sight
For by a rain that fill the same night
The ryuere wex to a dredful flode
And not far thens in the kings sight
Upon the water a lytyl town there stood
Which made the king change face and blood
And specially his pride began attame
When he wist pondosia was the name
And than he began most dreedfully remember
Calling to mind the prestes diuinayle
Which made him quake in every joint and membre
For verrey feere and his breath to fail
No man could him wissh nor counsel
O^ every party he stood so on the wrack
The flode tofore him his enmyes at his back
To take the river he stood in mortal dread
And if that he his enemies did abide
He wyste well that he was but deed
Passage was none for to turn aside
Thus dissolat he stood withouten guide
Thought it better to iuparte the ryuere
Than with enmyes that followed him so nere
Their mortal dredes his heart began constreyne
Dread of the flode for to have passage
Byhynde his enmyes that began at him disdeyne
List he were slain in that mortal rage
His fate approchynge he but young of age
The town pandosia the tokyns did express
With acheronte that bare thereof witness
And when that he put in adventure
To pass the flode or else to be deed
Whom he most trust of any creature
Took a great spear square and sharp the head
And at his back he quakynge in his dread
Trayturly throughout plate and mayle
Percyd his heart the blood abroad began rail
And as it is also of him remembered
The Lucanois by vengeable violence
They have his careyn on pecys all dismembryd
Till an old lady being in presence
Requered them of humble patience
That she of grace gadre might anon
His members all and join them into one
And after to send them unto his suster dear
Olimpiades the statly great queen
That of affeccion and love most entere
When it befyll that she did them seen
Should of nature as it must nedys been
Weep and provide in his estate royal
To burye the body with feast funeral
Se here exaumple of this proud king
Which would have scapyd his fatal destenye
Change of placys auayled him nothing
Parodye of princis may not changed be
The term set fro which they may not fle
For when heuene of death has set a date
No mortal man may eschew his fate
How Darie king of Perce and mede was outrayed by alisaundre king of
macedoyne
IN Alisaundre called Epirothes
Me list as now no longer for to tarry
Slain at mischeef for he was recheles
Double of courage for he caude change and varye
For turn I will my pen to king da^ye
Which that whilom who so list take heed
Most mighty regnyd in perce and mede
And among other notable warriors
Like as I d^me by heuynly influence
Only by title of his predecessors
And ^^^ough his prudent royal excellence
^o great encres of his magnificence
He had all As^e as made is mention
Under his lordship and dominacion
And as mine auctour bochas does diffyne
He was descendyd from the imperial blood
^f artaxe^ses and borne eke of that line
P^ssed all princis of tresour and of good
In perce and meede his great empire stood
An hundryd prouyncys teneres of puissaunce
And seuene and thretly he had in governance
Over all as^e toward the orient
His lordship last bokys make mind
And had toward the occident
Over Egypt power as I find
The read see was not left behind
D^mynge him silf of all erthely tresoure
Was none but he lord and gouernoure
Toward Septemptrion under the mydday spear
^is power raught and his regalye
Over ynde in cronicles ye may lere
And to the bounds of great armenie
Lord of the kingdom that called is Parthie
Worldly folk dempte him with god egall
Master to fortune and she not but his thrall
But in his highest exaltacion
Of worldly glory he could not prevail
For all his richesse and vein ambicion
But fortune durst him well assail
In his most rich royal apparayle
Cast in her chaungys to give him a sharp shoure
By alisaundre of greece enherytoure
Unto purpos I will my pen dress
For to declare and make mention
How proud darye in his most noblesse
Was by fortune from his sete cast down
For anon after the coronacion
Of alisaundre in macedoyne king
This was the process anon of his werkinge
He not delayed nor made no long date
In purpos fully of ire to proceed
Of perce and mede the scepters to translate
All their richessys to conquer and possede
Perpetually for to abide in deed
Under Grekys mighty obeisaunce
In macedoyne to have governance
And as mine auctour well reherce can
He set in greece the mighty strong cite
Of Corynth the metropolitan
There to establissh his Imperial se
In regalibus when he list crowned be
As man whom god list of his might to mark
The world to conquer and be thereof monarke
At the gynnynge of his conquest famous
Throughout Greece in every region
First he chase out of his faders house
Knightys that were most souereyne of renoun
Notable in armies and of condition
Feithfull and true which had of hye prudence
Forsight in armies of marciall providence
To them he did full notably assign
As men expert in knightly apparailis
To make his stuff with many rich sign
And forge of stele his plate and his mailis
Gave them the rule to govern in batailis
For providence of yore it has be told
Full much avails of knightys wys and old
All this accomplisshed he list no longer tarry
This worthy king but with his ordenaunce
Purposyd to begin on king darye
And as it is put in remembrance
In most proud wise he began him silf auaunce
First in his weye to brenne and beat down
Of hasty ire Thebes the mighty town
After he gate two mighty regions
The tone of frige the the other called lyde
Set by old time were their fundacions
Upon two ryuers rennynge there beside
Whose golden grauels their brightness may not hide
Pa^eolus and Eryne men them call
Richest of stremys though men rekne them all
And of his conquest ferther to termyne
He wan Isauria a province wonder strong
In Asia one cheuest of the nine
And pamphile a kingdom large and long
He gate also where it were right or wrong
For where that conquest have any title of right
My cu^nynge it passes my reason and my might
I took no pertye nor me list not tarry
In this matter but for I will proceed
How alisaundre hastyd toward darye
T^cheue his conquest of perce and eke of meede
But first he came to Frigia I read
Into a cite the name to specefie
Think days it named was gordye
After mine auctoure afferme well I dare
There was a temple in Frigya thus seith he
Of Jupiter in which there stood a chare
With ropys bound of stonys and of perre
Among which men might behold and se
A fatal knot by craft made so sotyle
That no man could undo it by no wyle
For who that had science or cu^nynge
That corious knot to lose or untwine
Over asye he should be crowned king
And alisaundre as bokys determyne
^eynge this chare knyt with many line
And how it sempte a manner Imppossyble
To severe it which was Indiuisyble
The chare with cordys was so enterlacyd
That richely stood in Iouis tabernacle
Which by his wit could not be enbracyd
Nouther by craft nor no soleyne miracle
Till Alisaundre by a dyuyne Oracle
Drowe out his sword whereof men had wondre
^arf the knot and cordys all asondre
Whereby he wist that he was ordained
Over all asye to be lord and king
Which to rejoice this story is not feyned
He rode like mars his bataylis co^ueynge
Through perce ynd m^^de (...) display^^e
Toward his conquest (...) I leave him dwell
And of this chare and knottys I will tell
Prudent Iustynus an old croniculere
In his cronicles reherseth this storye
How Gordius a pore laborere
Beside the cite that called is gordye
Erynge his land did his oxen guye
All manner foul that wings flight
Hye in the air apperyd in his sight
Vn^owe to him the tokne what it meant
With dyuynours cast him to counsel
Called augures which holy their en^ent
Knowing the process of such dyuynaile
Where it shall profit or disauayle
And at the gate of Gordye the Cite
He met amayde excellynge of beutye
Which from above by heavenly influence
Had of her birth a manner knowlegynge
In such augurye great practyke and science
Which to gordius expownyd every thing
Seyde of asye he should be lord and king
And regne there during all his lif
In hope whereof she becam his wif
After his wedding he wex fortunat
The cronicle can bear me well record
There fill in Frige a sodeyne great debate
Among the commons and mortal discord
Knowing no mean to bring them at accord
Till their goddys by notable providence
Taught them aweye tappese their violence
How that debate should among them last
Unto the time they had chosen a king
And they began cry and pray their goddys fast
By su^me sign or miracle out showing
To give to them a manner knowleginge
That they might to their notable encres
Chese such one that should them set in pes
They had answer to wait and be well ware
To set spies by besy attendaunce
On whoom they met ridinge in a chare
To Iouis temple to do his obseruaunce
And him receive by goddys ordenaunce
Upon his head without more tareynge
To set a crown in frige to regne as king
And Gordius in his chare ridinge
Toward the temple they on the wey him met
And awaitinge chas him to their king
And solemply home they did him fet
Upon his head a rich crown they set
And he to them so egall was and mete
That he them brought in rest and quiet
Thus to the crown gordius did atteyne
By tokyns showed unto his great avail
And their discordys and stryues to restreyne
He to his lieges gave notably counsel
That they should with royal apparaile
Take his chare as he did them devise
And offer it up in most lowly wise
In the temple that was consecrate
To Jupiter a full solemn place
And more to make their offringe fortunate
They should it set without longer space
Tofore the goddess that was called grace
Which by miracle their hertis to appese
Set all the people in quiet and in ese
And when the king alisaundre had
^osyd the knot of which I have you told
And of the chare which gordius ladde
The s^^^^^es seyne and misteryes many fold
Wordly presumpcion began make his heart bold
Without title of any rightwisnesse
The cite gordye to spoil of his richesse
And all affrigye he robbyd eke also
Up to the mounteyne that called was taurus
^he which hill has famous names two
For it is also named Caucasus
Where this prince most victorious
Ordained first proudly with spear and sheelde
Again king darye for to hold a feelde
Upon a mounteyne they to gedre met
The marciall pleyne named horestes
And most proudly their wardis there they set
Al^ for the werre and no thing for the pes
Where alisaundre in knighthode peerlles
All the Perciens batayled in his sight
On daryes perty put unto flight
King alisaundre shortly to conclude
In his most statly royal magnificence
Set not his trust in no great multitude
But in his knights which long in his presence
Had had in armies long experience
Were well preuyd in marciall disciplyne
To enhaunce his conquest by their prudent doctrine
Which in that Journey have them so well borne
That in their noblesse found was no lak
For sixty thousand of fotemen them beforne
They slough of perce and men on horsbak
Other ten thousand so mortal was the wrak
And forty thousand as made is mention
Were prisoners and put to their raunson
On grekys party the story does well show
Macedonoys on alisaundris side
In comparison were slain but a few
For of fotemen and men that did ride
Through the feeldes that were so large and wide
There were that day in their mortal stryues
Not full three hundred which that lost their lives
Darye could none other rescus make
Fled at mischeef in full great distress
His wife his daughter led awey and take
His tentys spoiled his story bears witness
Grekys made glad with full great richesse
His cofres spoiled he fond no better socoure
And he enporisshed of all his hole tresoure
When Darye saw his dedly adventure
Full pitously in heart he did mourn
And anon after this disconfiture
To babylon in have he began return
And while that he did there soiourne
Knowing no recure to him that might avail
With alisaundre to hold more bataile
Than of purpos to set him silf in ese
And for taledge his dedly fell greuaunce
In his intent king alisaundre to plese
Cast for to send him lettres of plesaunce
Give him giftys in full great habundaunce
But all the sleightes which Darius has wrought
King alisaundre set them echon at naught
This manly king kept his conceyte cloos
List not show what he meant in deed
But cast fully after his purpos
Upon his conquest ferther to proceed
After the getinge of perce and eke of meede
To win surrye Egypt and Libye land
Demynge fortune ready to his hand
And of his conquest ferther to endyte
When his glory began most fresshly shine
The temple of Jupiter cast him to visit
Which stood in lybye auctours determyne
Said how he was descendyd from the line
Of thilke god borne to be his heir
As lord of heuene fire water earth and air
And that the preestys fully should assent
With heuynly goddys to make him egall
Great richesse and tresoure he them sent
Thus dreed and meede made him celestial
Falsely forgate that he was mortal
And of ambicion by marciall apparayle
Cast with darye again to have battle
And as I find how they did mete
The two princes with people Innumerable
In the confronte of the land of Crete
And king darye of folkys defensable
Brought into feelde a people incomparable
Four hundryd thousand of fotemen fet fro far
With alisaundre for to hold werre
An hundred thousand there came with him also
On horsbak in steel armyd bright
And all this people when they had a do
Albe that day full long last the fight
Were slain and take and I put to flight
Where alisaundre to his encres of glory
Had of king darye that day the victory
And perciens to their fynall myscheef
Without mercy or paynge of raunson
With king darye were put to great repreef
Void of all hope and consolacion
Fled as I find into the region
Called party where as it is told
He of that people was take and put in hold
And though his fetirs were of gold rich
He had thereof god wot no plesaunce
Fortunys giftys be not ay Ilyche
In her falls whele there is such variaunce
Diverse of cheer strange of her countenance
^lade alisaundre with a lityll noumbre
The multitude of darye to encoumbre
Within a town Tharsa he was take
In charyet with cheynes strong I bound
Of all his friends pitously forsake
Led and through perced with many mortal wound
And this murdre contryued was and found
By one Bessus a froward recheles knight
Which stood before most furthred in his sight
And was assured by feith of his legiaunce
To king darye to be true in deed
But this false traytoure god send him a mischau^ce
Caused his woundys mortally to blede
Yet or he dyed he sent in all his dread
A percien knight sad and of great age
To alisaundre to tell him his message
To thank that prince of his hye noblesse
Which to his grace and mercy most habounde
Him list to show so great gentilnesse
Unto my wif and children as it is found
For which to him I am so much bound
That he mine enmy of benygnite
In their distress list have of them pity
And since I se that nedys I must deye
Through blody wou^dys which I may not recure
Sey alisaundre of grace that I preye
For to have ruth of mine adventure
Next to ordeyne for my sepulture
And condescende to grant mine axynge
For to be buried as longs to a king
Praynge the goddys which been immortal
When he has done to quyte him his mede
That if his mercy most imperial
Him list of grace for to take heed
To burye me king of perce and meede
For if this favor be in his heart found
To his noblesse the fame shall ay rebounde
Requeringe him of his imperial might
Of my foul murdre to se each circumstaunce
For murdre alwey calls to god of right
Neuir cesinge but by contynuaunce
Up to the heuene to cry for vengeance
Namely on murdre compassed and for thought
Which by auysement is execute and wrought
And since I have leyde on the this bond
To alisaundre to do my message
And him coniured here with my right hand
To avenge my death wrought by great outrage
My blood out shed with pale and deed visage
Here bound in stockys to goddys most benign
With right hole heart my sprite I resign
Thus he lay stark there was found no blood
Like as another mortal creature
When alisaundre the murdre understood
As ye have herd remembered by scripture
He did ordeyne for his sepulture
The funeral feast hold in all things
As by old time longyd unto kings
Lenuoye.
THis tragedy pitous for to here
Shows of fortune the chau^ges lamentable
Of royal thronys of gold and stonys clear
Of wordly princis how they be ever unstable
Their fatal whele most diverse and chaungeable
With unware turn list not her course to tarry
To throw them down record upon king Darye
Who can or may be full assured here
To make fortune to be so tretable
To find out awey or search out the manner
By obligacion to find her Immutable
Her double face the world ay deceyuable
Show us each day how falsely they can varye
By covert fraud record upon king Darye
Exaumple how phoebus with her bemys clear
Shows sum morrow his light most agreeable
But long or ^ue derkenesse there does appear
Through cloudy reins and mystes long durable
To us declaringe by toknes full notable
Wordly dignitees now fressh and now contrary
Can change their tides record of king Darye
Through all asye perce and meede I fere
His lordship last a thing incomparable
To ethiopie under the mydday spear
Full of tresoure with gold Innumerable
His boundys raught fortune eke seruisable
To obey his lustys till she began falsely varye
By expert fraud to preue her might in Darye
Noble princes with hole heart and entere
Lift up your corages hold this no fable
Though ye sit hye co^ceyue with good chere
No wordly lordship in earth is perdurable
And sith ye be of nature reasonable
Among remember as thing most necessary
All stant upon change record on king Darye
Here bochas remembers the batyles and loss of Realmeys of antiquyte / with
the falling of diverse nobles.
HEte gynneth Bochas remember in certain
The great sorrows the mortal disauayles
The loss of realms the blood shed in vein
Begone of werrys and marciall apparayles
Called to mind of old the fell batailes
Gu^ne of antyquite as made is mention
First again Grekys and them of troy tou^
A pitous heart it would make blede
To have in memory the dredefull great outrage
As ye have herd wrought in Perce and Meede
Atwene Darye and Alisaundre in their age
Eke atwene Romans and them of Cartage
The woeful troublys of werrys first begone
Cause all the myscheuys that been under son
On outher party who can remember aright
Now loss now lucre comyth of dyuision
Now disencres now heavy and now light
Now life now death for short conclusion
For bochas seith such falls discencion
Has many kingdom that stood in good estate
Turned to ruin and made them desolate
Remember of troy the wallys broke down
In greece destroyed many strong cite
In perce and mede great desolacion
Rome dispurueyde of marcyall suerte
Castellys toures of old antiquite
Made ruynous in affryke and cartage
Caused by werrys and marcys cruel rage
Who list considre wrought by days old
The course of conquest of these werreours
In alisaundre he clearly may behold
By remembraunbre of his progenitors
And of his blood how all the successors
Had fatally or they did hens wend
A sodeyne death or a shameful end
Full many rekened that were of his lynage
For to succeed in his possessions
To six and thritty pertinge his heritage
To each assigned their royal porcions
First as he made his divisions
He gave of frige the prefecture of rig^
To Leonatus that was so good a knight
But a litell while last his pssession
For the contrees list them not obey
They of athenys had indignacion
With antipater for he did werreye
Yet in that werre plainly for to seye
Leostenes their duke their gouernoure
Was slain that day he fond no better socoure
And Leonatus that was his aduersarye
Of antipater the party to sustene
Fond fortune to him that day contrary
For in the feelde though he rode armed clean
With a sharp spear his wound was made grene
At mischeef slain mine auctoure does compile
Thus his lordship last not but a while
Antipater another successoure
Of alisaundre as made is mention
Was by record of the same falls traitoure
That for his death tempred the poison
His son cassandir accomplisshed the treson
Bare the cup which that made him sterue
With that strong venym when he did him serve
Antipater of this crime coupable
Greatly desired in his opinyon
Upon all tho that be vengeable
That lykly were to espy his treson
Dredde him sore having suspeccion
List he were accused to thestatis
Of crime called lose magestatis
His son assented to that horrible deed
Which to alisaundre being in babylon
Most traitourly without shame or dread
As ye have herd prensentyd the poison
And yet the king as made is mention
Though he to him falls was and contrary
He made him prefect lord of the land of Carye
And among other notable werr^ours
There were three more full worthy and famous
Set in the nounbre of his enheritours
Policarpus and Neptolonius
And each of them to other enuyous
Within a feelde the story does us lere
Eueriche slough other as they met Ifere
Of Perdicas what should I write or seyne
Which among all was one the best knight
That when alisaundere lay in diynge in certain
And began to feeble of his force and might
Dempt before that it sat well of right
How this perdicas for wysdom and manhede
In Macedoyne should after him succeed
And unto him with chere and look benygne
Upon his head for sikenesse compleynynge
With full hool heart for a notable sign
Of succession he gave to him a ringe
After his day to be crowned king
Of macedoyne since he most might avail
Through all his empire to have the gouernayle
And yet seyth Bochas breuely in sentence
Though he of knighthode and hye prowess
Of manly force and also of prudence
Passed all other the story bears witness
By vicious pride and froward boystousnesse
He was more hindryd through his outrage
Than all his enmyes might do to him damage
For through his pride and great extorcions
Fro Macedoyne the people of that cuntre
Fled into other strange regions
And of presumpcion the store seith how he
Began awerre again king Tholome
Where he was slain in all mennys sightis
Not of his enmyes but of his own knightis
Eke of Anaxarchus of Capadoce king
Which province joins to Surrye
Touching the bounds by record of writing
Toward the oryent the land of Armenye
Having two cuntrees Salice and ysaurye
Toward Cipre and a great Ryuere
Rennynge amyddys with s^remys fressh and clear
This Aanaxarchus where he was loath or feign
In days few has his kingdom borne
For by Perdicas proudly he was slain
Of whom that I have you told beforne
Thus wordly princys though they had it sworn
For all their lordshyp and domynacion
By fraud of fortune unwarily be put down
And among other princis of that age
Upon alisaundre duly abiding
Bochas reherceth Amulchar of Cartage
Duke of that cite by record of writing
After the death of that worthy king
As ye have herd I murdered by poison
This feyde amulchar reparinge to his town
Was slain in Cartage shortly to conclude
Of cruel malice and conspiarison
Within that cite of falls ingratitude
When he of knighthode fraunchised had the town
And withstandinge all his hye renoun
When he stood highest in his felicite
He by the commons was slain of that cite
How Eumenydes was twyes outrayed by Antigo^us / and at the last dyed in prison
When alisaundre in his roya^ estate
Had all conqueryd tofore as ye have herd
He like a god most pompous and elate
As souereyne prince of all this myddelerd
To take upon him was no thing aferde
To ^leyme in cuntrees a thing that was not fair
Of Iupyter to be both son and heir
One of the principles who so takes head
That first brought in falls Idolatrye
Was th^^ke time that preestys for falls dread
His name with goddys began to magnefie
And so to call him of feynyd flaterye
And myd their temples in libye on a stage
Of his liknesse they set up an image
But lityll or naught to him it might avail
Again his death for to do socoure
When the fell poison his heart did assail
Which made him fade as does a somer flower
Of whoos empire was none enheritoure
Save in his death thus stood the woeful cas
Twene six and thritty his land divided was
And in his story full pleynly it is told
This departicion to make it ferme and stable
He was leyde forth upon a couch of gold
To reherce by tokenys full notable
Whoom he dempt of very soth most able
Of all his princys pleynly to descerne
When he were deed his kingdom to govern
First there was one among all that prees
Next alisaundre the knightliest man
The worthy knight called Eumenides
Whoos hye renoun full well reherce can
Prudent Iustynus the great historyan
Ordained before to govern realms two
All Capadoce and pafflagonie also
His hye noblesse as made is mention
In especial more to magnefie
Him lackyd naught of commendacion
That apperteyned unto chyualrye
To hye prudence or noble policye
Except three things mine auctoure seith the same
A crown a scepter and a kings name
But for that he all other did excelle
Both of prudence and famous chyualrye
It is remembered as some bokys tell
That there were su^me had thereat envy
For when fortune list to set up hye
Any person aloft upon her whele
Su^me are beside that like it neueradele
Who holds him ever upon hye mounteyns
Fyndeth great experience of blastys and shoures
Often is troubled with storm and wind reins
So of alisaundre the proud successoures
When they sat highest shynynge in their flowers
Wind of envy fortune held so the rothir
That each was besy to destroy other
On hillys hye it is an impossible
A man tabyde without wind or reyne
A thing expert and very vysible
Hye clymbynge up is medlyd with disdeyne
Prees has envy as it is often seyne
And through preferrynge of fortune in estatys
Is ever caused great werre and great debatys
This same thing was well expert and preuyd
Among these seyde royal enheritours
Of alisaundre for each of them was greuyd
To se his fellow regne in his flowers
And thus atwene these mighty successors
Of falls envy there began so great a stryf
That each made other for to lose his life
And as it is before made mention
Policarpus and neptolonyus
By a manner falls conspiracion
Again Eumenides were enly envious
Of whoos falsnesse he was susspecious
Till on a day there is no more to seyne
Metynge in battle he slough them both tweyen
For which slaughter proud antigo^^s
Of macedoyne prefecte and gouernoure
Wex in his heart so fell and despitous
And was withal amoble werroure
With his knights did holy his labor
Again Eumenides by marciall apparayle
A feelde assigned to hold a great battle
Made upon him a great disconfiture
As they met armyd bright in steel
And thus Eumenides of mortal adventure
Fled at myscheef into a strong castle
Whereof his knights lyked neueradele
For as the story pleynly makes mind
That day he fled and left his men behind
In which castle for he stood destitute
Fro thens he cast in all have to fle
In his great myscheef to find sum refute
That time he drough him to a strong cuntre
Some socoure to get auengyd for to be
Called argire by grekys of intent
The latin corrupt of this word argent
Of archiraspedes a people that there dwell
Their name they took after that region
The which land as old bokys tell
Has of silver plente and foyson
For which cause by old description
It took his name of nature and of right
Because the soil like silver shyneth bright
And of this isle which has so great a pris
As mine auctour makes rehersayle
How the people be provident and wis
Prudent in armies and manly in battle
Both to diffende and proudly to assail
Which by their wisdom and circu^spect counsel
To king alisaundre stood in great avail
And Eumenides one of his successors
As ye have herd drew to that cuntre
There to find refute and socours
In his mischeef and great aduersite
And with his wordys of great auctoryte
His noble langage and his fair eloquence
The people had him in full great reverence
And for they were manly and coraious
Able to assemble both in plate and mayle
He made them rise again antigonus
By their prowes with him to have battle
But of fortune his party began to fail
Where thilke people the story tells thus
Had before be victorious
Antigonus has the feelde recured
That day his knightys faught like wodelyons
In furious tene of courage assured
Brake their tents and their pauylions
Spoiled their castles robbyd their dungeons
Where that cuntre unwarily thus affrayed
Had never before in battle ben outrayed
And of dispyte this people recheles
Caught in their heart great indignacion
Again their prince this seyde Eumenides
Which had them brought to their destruction
And all that people of one opinion
Presentyd him it was not after long
To antigonus bound in cheynes strong
In this process breuely to proceed
At great mischeef he dyed in prisoun
He fond no mercy plainly as I read
For all his noblesse nor his hye renoun
Yet of his manhood it is made mencioun
Who that his story list to look aright
With alisaundre there was no better knight
In his conquest every hour and space
He most cherisshed for his high nobles
Above all other stood most in his grace
To help and releue folk in their distress
Albe that he dyed in wretchydnes
To us declarynge the great variaunces
That all day fall in fortunes chances
Lenuoye
THis tragedye of Duke Eumenides
Shows of fortune the froward doublenes
How wordly princes that been recheles
With unware chaunges fall in distres
And there may be no gretter heaviness
After prosperity nor gretter pain
Than aduersite which that is sodeyne
Grettest envy where is grettest pes
Grettest awayte where is moast richesse
And grettest ese where is rest and pes
Where most discord most is heaviness
And of all sorrow sorowfulest excess
Is thilke sorrow that a man constreyne
After prosperity aduersite sodeyne
Princis in earth of power peerles
Which excelled all other in no bless
Had in this world by conquest most encres
As alisaundre the story bears witness
Remember the fine of all their hye prowess
And the tryumphes to which they did atteyne
After prosperity aduersite sodeyne
The strong enheritour which that he out ches
Six and thretty the noumbre to express
Which had possessions of kingdoms doutles
Each thing obeynge to their worthynesse
Till fortune thought her doubleness
Showed her might unwarily to ordeyne
After prosperity aduersite sodeyne
Noble princes to avoid all disencres
Among your silf discordys do repress
Be not enuyous nor Irous causeles
Work no thing of hasty wylfulnesse
Late discrecion be your gouerneresse
For there must follow if ye part on tweyne
After prosperity aduersite sodeyne
How queen Olimpiades for she delyted in vices / murdre and vengeance dyed at
myscheef
NExt in order to Bochas did appear
After the myscheef of Eumenides
The great queen with a full pitous chere
Mother of alisaundre Olimpiades
Borne of the line of Gaades
Among quenys her story bears witness
Excelled all other in beutye and richesse
She was daughter to neptolonyus
The mighty king of Epirothes
And had suspect how Neptanabus
By enchauntment put him silf in pres
Of wyuely troth to make him recheles
But bochas here for to save her name
Write but a little of her disclamirous fame
This seyde queen right fair of her visage
Was first brought forth in thilke regions
Where all the worthy of blood and of lynage
Held their scepters and their rich crou^s
Throughoute all greece with full possessiou^s
So that this queen that time nere and far
Was of bewtye called the lodesterre
But among all her great prosperity
Her youth flouynge in most souereyne noblesse
Her joy was meddled with great aduersite
When philip Macedo to her great heaviness
Was mortally wounded in distress
In Cythia by a certain nation
Called Trybaloys as made is mencyon
For in that cuntre upon a certain day
Where as he faught and did his best pain
To get a cite and at a siege lay
And for thassaut did his sluff ordeyne
He lost unwarily one of his iyen tweyne
That when the queen beheld his sodeyne wound
For sorrow she fill even plat to the ground
Anothir thing bokys specefye
Troubled her fame by great heuinesse
The suspecte sclaundre of auoutrye
Wrought by Neptabanus enchauntynge her fairenes
The light Eclipsinge of hye noblesse
By swift report for to hindre her name
What flees more swift than wicked fame
In womanhede as auctoures all write
Most thing commendyd is their chaste honest
Thing most sclaundrous their noblesse tatwyte
Is when princessys of hasty freelte
Excede the bounds of wiuely chastyte
For what avails lynage or royal blood
When of their living the report is not good
The holy bed diffoiled of marriage
Or onys soyled may not recured be
The voice goth forth and the froward langage
By many realms and many great cite
Sclaundre has of custum and that is pite
True other falls by contagious soun
Onys raised it goth not lightly down
And to more hindringe of olimpiades
Philip awey did fram her declyne
And of the king of Epirothes
The wife he took to his concubyne
Called Cleopatra pleynly to termyne
And thus in mischeef tencres of her trouble
Their falls auoutry began to wex double
Of this process write I will no more
Cause the matter is abhomynable
For king philip the bargeyne bought sore
As is remembered by chronicles full notable
Slain on a day sitting at his table
Full suddenly or he took any head
Pansanias did that cruel deed
Of which slaughter there followed a strange cas
As ye have herd by pansanias wrought
Olimpiades full glad and merry was
Heavy outward her heart void of thought
Yet feynyngly she has out ways sought
For him to hold solemn and royal
Like Grekys rightes a feast funeral
After whoos death wrought of great cruelte
King alisaundre made no lengre let
Made Pansanias takyn for to be
And to be hangyd upon an hye gybet
Upon whoos head there was a crown set
Of gold and perle and rich stones Inde
By olympiades in story as I find
For he stood greatly in the quenys grace
And as folk dempt of suspection
They met to gydre in many preuy place
Which greatly turnyd to her confusion
For noise aroos through all that region
That by thoccasion of their mislyuynge
How pansanias slough philyp the king
But she anon in her malice fervent
Fro the gybet made him to be take down
Made his body solemply to be brent
Kept his exequies with great oblacion
After the rightes of that region
Not left behind in party nor in all
That apperteyned to festys funeral
Upon king philip as it were for the nonys
To do her lord a shame a despite
Solemply she made brenne the bonys
Of pansanias for a falls appetyte
Unto no man she had so great despite
For which this feast was like in all things
To thexequies of princes and of kings
She made his sword also to be take
With which he slough philyp the great king
Offered it up only for his sake
Tofore appollo by record of writynge
Which to her was sclaundre and great hindringe
Caused folk deem in their intent
To sle king philyp how she was of assent
To be cruel was set all her plesaunce
For merciles void of all pity
On cleopatre causinge this vengeance
That she her silf henge upon a tree
Murdered her daughter the story ye may se
What malice may if it be declared
Unto the malice of wymen be compared
Speak of them that be malicious
And list of custom for to be vengeable
Among a thousaunde one may be virtuous
And in two thousand sum one is merciable
But when they be of rancour vntretable
There is no tigre more cruel doubtless
Record I take of Olimpiades
And she of malice was more set of fire
To execute boldly her vengeance
By thoccasion of the great empire
Of perce and meede full famous in substance
Which stood by conquest under the governance
Of alisaundre whereby she thought her strong
Tacheue each thing whether it be right or wrong
Dempt her power should ay contune
By the mean of his high mageste
God is stronger than the queen fortune
Which suffered her son in her most dignite
In babylone poysened for to be
As is remembered in many old histories
After his triumphs and his victories
But for to pass breuely to the writing
Touching the queen as made is mention
When deed was philip the famous king
She had of macedoyne full possession
And governed that mighty region
Where like a wuluesse as auctours of her write
To shede blood she began her silf delight
In her tyranny most fervent and yrou^
Reioysed in slaughter and to se men blede
For serpent none was more malicious
Than was this queen in books ye may read
Yet after all this she received her mede
For though fortune favored her a while
yet with her treynes she could her well begyle
The end of tyrauntes and eke of tyranesses
and of murdres be they never so wode
Of poison mongers and enchaunteresses
Of falls supplantours contrary to all good
And of conspirers and them thriste blood
All these must have by goddys purueaunce
H^re short life or sodeyne vengeance
In macedoyne this queen was most behatyd
For her vengeable mortal oppression
And Cassander again her has debatyd
And gu^ne a werre upon her region
Which to alisaundre mynystred the poison
As ye have herd to fore of him diuysed
By antipater most mortally practiced
She fond no refute but took her to flight
This cruel queen this olympiades
Into a mounteyne that stood far out of sight
And of her kyn there followed her a great p^es
Supposing to have lived there in pees
For on that hill stood a great dongeon
Strongly wallyd about enuyron
Which that marchyd to a great cite
Called Epidua stondyng in great doubt
Because Cassandre of old enmyte
Had for her leyde a syege about
And none was hardy for to issue out
Till cassandre of falls compassed treson
Made with them a composicion
His feith was leyde that time for hostage
By oath assured to olimpyades
By covert fraud under fair langage
To suffer her with him to live in pees
But of his promys he falls and recheles
For under trete as made is mention
The queen he took and cast her in prison
But will ye se a royal hye courage
How boldly delivered fro prison
She descended imperial of visage
With all her maidens about her enuiron
Her enmys present wodder than lion
Seeing her stand so statly of her face
When they were proudest tareste her and manace
She was of purpose arrayed for the nones
As seyth bochas in most statly wise
In rich purpyl gold and precious stonys
Like an empress in the grekyssh guyse
Her list not fle the storye does diuyse
With cry nor noise passed not her bounds
When that her blood dou^ rayled from her wounds
She not affrayed in all her mortal shoures
Void of all fere list not low her chyne
Make no prayer to her turmentoures
Nor no tokne of courage feminyne
Upright she stood list not down declyne
Gave evidences as it is comprehended
Of what line and blood she is descendyd
For unto time that she gave up the breath
Was never seyne prince nor princess
That more proudly took their fatal death
For as I deem her marciall hardynesse
Came from Bellona of armies cheef goddess
Or she had it by influence of courage
You by the goddys to her and her lynage
Force is a virtue books specefye
Again all vices to make resistance
But froward rancoure and proud malencolye
Gave her a sprite of feyned patience
A falls pretense of her magnyficence
As scaunce she had been in virtue strong
For troth to have endured every wrong
Contrarious force made her despitous
Strong in her error to endure pain
Of obstynate heart she was fell and Irous
In dethys constreynt listnat to complain
Counterfeit suffraunce made her for to feyne
No thing of virtue pleynly to termyne
Nor of no mannys that be femynyne
In her entrayles all malice was enclosyd
And all contagyous venym serpentyne
Not like a woman but as a feende disposyd
Able to destroy all virtuous disciplyne
Thus she began thus she did fine
In vicious murdre she did her ay delight
Wherefore of her me list no more tendyte
Lenuoye.
AL ye that shall this tragedye see
Of ruth and mercy have compassion
To se a princess from her Imperial see
So unwarily by fortune throw down
Of whose myscheef this was thoccasion
That in three things was set most her plesaunce
In vicious life in murdre and vengeance
Alas that ever the mortal cruelte
Of blody sword by execusion
Should be appropryd to feminite
Again the nature of their condition
Causinge the fynall sclaundrous confusion
Of olimpidiades here put in remembrance
For vicious lif murdre and falls vengeance
Under fressh flowers sote and fair to se
The serpent dares with his covert poison
In cristall waters that calm and sote be
Are perilous pittes full of decepcion
Men se al day by clear inspection
In feynynge facys aungelike suffisaunce
Her underneath rancoure and great vengeance
Though she excelled of her natyf beutye
All other princys of that region
Was never none feller seen than she
To execute like her opinion
The perilous treynes contreuyd of treson
And specially in her pompous greuaunce
Where she hated for to do vengeance
Noble princes set hye in dignite
Do advertise of discrecion
In your most power and largest liberte
Be merciable and do remission
Sugre with pity your indignacion
Late grace and mercy tempre your hye puissaunce
Of olimpiades eschuynge the vengeance
Exile ricoure far out of cuntre
Give him with you no Jurisdiction
To womanhede laugh not parde
Of cancred rancoure new execucion
Where mercy regneth of grace there is foison
Have this in mind by long contynuaunce
Of olimpiades forgetinge the vengeance
Late patience by virtuous plente
Within your hertys purchase a mancion
Late your compassion attempre equite
That right excede not the bounds of reason
So that your femynyn humble entencion
Be alweye brydled by provident suffraunce
Voidinge all excessys of ricour and of vengeance
For it is said of old auctoryte
To woman longs by disposicion
Meekness in langage in port humilite
In all virtue humble subjection
Void of manacis strif and contencion
So that no man in your attendaunce
Espy no tokyn of rancour nor vengeance
The special mean the parcialite
Should of all mercy be descripcion
Rebounde to wymen for of antiquyte
The lamb not used to pley the lion
Nor no meke down enuyed the faucon
Nor to your degree by natural accordaunce
Sit nouther ricoure nor hasty fell vengeance
This simple lenuoye receive it at gre
And have thereof none indignacion
Lowly direct to your benignite
Only of meekness and no presumpcion
Knowing of kind your inclinacion
Disposed is by natural purueaunce
Unto al mercy and no thing unto vengeance
How agathodes of low birth borne atteyned unto royal dignite / endyd in
pouerte and wretchidnesse.
I Have herd seyde of full yore agone
A whirlwinde blowynge no thing soft
Was in old Inglisshe called a rodion
That reyseth dust and straw full hye alofte
And in thascendinge it falls so full often
Though it be borne almoost to the sky
Where it becomes there can no man espy
Out of forgys by fire that smythes make
By clear experyence it is full often I seyne
That these infernal ougly smokys blake
Transcende the cop of many great mounteyne
But often since by a full sodeyne reyne
All such assencions by rage of wind up blow
With unware turn be reuersed and brought low
And semblably to put it at a preef
And execute it by clear experience
O^e the most contrarious mischeef
Found in this earth by notable evidence
Is only this by fortunate violence
When that wretch^s churlissh of nature
Thestate of princes unwarily does recure
A crown of gold is no thing according
For to be set upon a knaves head
A foltissh ^lerke for to were a ringe
Acordeth not who that can take heed
And in this world there is no gretter dread
Than power you if it be well sought
Unto such one that first rose up of naught
There is no manner just conuenience
A royal carbonele rubye or garnet
Nor a chaste Emeraude of virtuous excellence
Nor I^de saphus in coper to be set
Their kindly power in foul metal is let
And so thes^ate of politic puissaunce
(...) lost where ever knaves have governance
For a time they may well up ascend
Like wyndy smokys their boystous fumys sprede
A crownyd ass plainly to comprehend
Void of discrecion is more for to dread
Than is a lion for that one in deed
Of his nature is mihgty and royal
Void of discrecion that other bestyall
The gentle nature of a strong lion
To prostrat people of kind is merciable
For unto all that fall before him down
His royal puissaunce can not be vengeable
But cherisshe wulues by ricoure vntretable
And foltissh assys eke of bestyalite
Faylinge reason brayde ever on cruelte
None is so proud as he that can no good
The lewder head the more presumpcion
Most cruelte and vengeance in low blood
With malapertnesse and indiscrecion
Of churl and gentle make this division
Of outher of them I dare right well report
The stok they came fro thereto they will resort
The rose know by color and swetnesse
And violettys for their fressh tarage
The netle rough for his fell sharpness
Thistlys brerys prinkinge by great outrage
And thus considred the rote of each lynage
Froward tetchys been ever in churlys found
Where unto gentiles ay virtue does rebounde
Late men beware in especial of one thing
How great decepcion is in falls coignage
The plate may be bright in his showing
The metal falls and show a fair vysage
All is not gold to speak in pleyne langage
That shyneth bright concludinge on reason
Under fair chere is often hyd falls poison
For as a sky or an ougly cloud
Which that ascends low out of the sea
And with his blaknesse does the son shrowde
That may not his great brightness se
Nor have no confort of his clear beutye
So vicious tetchis I do you well assure
Difface fuloft the giftys of nature
God unto some has yeuyn by nature
For to excelle another in fayrenesse
Yet in vicys by record of scripture
They were disclaundryd bochas bears witness
Outward sugre inward bitterness
By which exaumple to purpos I may call
Agathodes fulfilled with vices all
In this story he comes now on the ringe
Which of beutye had great excellence
But to declare the vicious lyuinge
And to discryue his outrageous offense
If I should write in sentence
Like his demeritys holy the manner
It would through Perce and blotte my papere
Touching his birthe of low bed descendyd
Son of a potter the story ye may se
In no virtue I find him not co^mendyd
Except nature gave him great beute
Fostred in myscheef and great pouerte
Had eke dysdeyne I can him not excuse
Of hateful pride his faders craft to use
By the mean of his great fayrenesse
To hye estate he came from low degree
Yet in a vice which I will not express
He disusyd cursydly his beutye
Again nature that evil mut they the
And soyled he was shortly to specefye
With all the spices of pride and lecherye
Yet not withstandinge his false conditions
God suffered him to come to hye estate
And to govern diverse nations
I find a while how he was fortunate
In his lecherye ay pompous and elate
And in a cite called cyracuse
The said vyses frowardly he began use
And for he had beutye and great might
To all vices his youth he did enclyne
And could also forthre him silf aright
Of eloquence expert in the doctrine
And as it is said though he came of low line
Yet as it is put in remembrance
An hundred knights he had in governance
Of Centuryen he purchased an office
And that time he took the order of knight
After chosyn a tribune of great price
And gate great favor in the people sight
And in this while it fell so anon right
Of Cyracusys he was made duke and head
By election by cause their lord was deed
Which with Siciliens held a mortal strif
But agathodes made him victorious
Took their duchess after to his wife
By mean whereof he wex full glorious
And in his glory he grew right despitous
Forgate him silf thus growing in estate
Wherthrough his cite and he were at debate
His condition when they began espy
And saw him work all of presumpcion
The people anon knowing his tyranny
Exiled him out of their region
In his exyle as made is mention
He could find no better cheuisaunce
But came to a cite that called was Murgaunce
Where by his sleighty subtle falls auys
He so demenyd him in the people sight
That of a praetor they gave him an offis
He meuynge them in all that ever that he might
Geyne Ciracusys to make them strong and fight
Of intent on them to avenged be
Cause for his exyle out of that cite
But in his exyle the story seyth none other
It was so wrought by medyacion
Of duke Amulchar that was his sworn brother
Ciracusanis of one entencion
Called home again into their town
And there was restoryd to his place
And reconciled to the kings grace
And unto him they gave by great auys
By assent of lords and all the comonte
Of a Praetor newly an offis
For pretores of custum called be
Officers that dwell in the cite
And have full charge by dome and Iugementys
To put all gylty to pain and to tormentys
Than of new this Agathodes
Because he had more auctoryte
Cast for to trouble the quyete and the pes
Of ciracusis and out of that cite
All the Senators grettest of dignite
Of mortal vengeance this tiraunt made anon
Without excepcion be slain euerychon
This hasty slaughter wrought by tyranny
Might not assuage nor staunche his fell courage
Till he their tresours took by robbrye
And all Sycile he spoiled by pillage
Cast of pride upon an hyer stage
For to assende by sleighty falls werkinge
Of all that region he took to be crowned king
Made his subgettys maugre them him dredynge
To call him king and in especial
On the most worthy prince tho living
That sat in chair of mageste royal
Till fortune shope he must have a fall
For of cartage the duke a worthy knight
Faught with him twyes and put him to flight
Wherthrough he stood in mischeef dispei^ed
And of a people he was had in disdeyne
To Ciracuse in have he is repeired
And to his cite returned home again
There abydinge in dread and uncertain
For when fortune began again him take
His friends old of new have him forsake
In that myssheef he bode not long
As the process makes rehersayle
Gadryd people and made him silf strong
Only in purpos all affrik tassayle
With them of cartage had a great bataile
Them disconfited as fortune list ordeyne
By hye prowess of his sons tweyne
Arthagathus I called was that one
Wondre deliver a man of great might
The second brother most worthy of echone
Called Eraclida which in that mortal fight
Preued himsilf that day a manly knight
For by their manhood in which there was no lack
They of cartage were felly put abacke
For though so were by fortune of the werre
Agathodes had that day victory
Falls couetyse made him for to err
And eclipsyd the light of his glory
For as it is remembered in his story
Like as his birth as it toforne termyned
To all falsnes his courage was enclyned
Cruel of custum of heart mercyles
His will was law were it wrong or right
Contrary to accord froward unto pes
Proud and surquedous in his own sight
Where his powere stretchyd and his might
Like a tyrant naturally disposed
To execute vengeance before purposyd
He thought he had power forto bind
Fortunes whele for to abide stable
Which is a thing contrary to her kind
Whose property is to be variable
His pride alas was to abominable
For mortal prince is none that may restreyne
Her unware turn nor her course sodeyne
By influence of the heuynly sterres
The uncouth course above celestial
By fortune and favor of the werres
This agathodes of birth full rural
Promotyd was unto estate royal
Till pride outrage and froward engendrure
Caused in his lordship he might not long endure
Fortune of kind is so flaskisable
Amonstruous be departed manyfolde
A slydinge serpent turninge and unstable
Sliper to gripe on whom there is none hold
As in this book declared is and told
His power preuyd on princys recheles
Record with other on agathodes
As ye have herd rehercyd in sentence
Simple and bare was his natyuite
Brought up and fostred in great indigence
Out of a stock springinge of pouerte
Ros to thestate of royal dignite
Their risinge uncouth marvelous tatteyne
The fall more grievous because it was sodeyne
From Ciracuse he was exiled twyes
Vengeably of heart where he had might
Of affricans disconfited twyes
Ever in battle of custum put to flight
Had an vsaunce to rob day and night
And like a tyrant again conscience
To spoil his subgettys by rauynous violence
Kindred by fortune whereof he was not feign
Her stroke again him sodeyne and violent
His sons two in affrik were first slain
He of his lymmes wex feeble and impotent
With a consumpcion his entrayles brent
And by an ague contynuall of feruence
He was supprysed by stroke of pestilence
All his tresoure has from him take
His proud port and his wordly glory
His kyn his friends and his wif has him forsake
His conquest dyrk and put out of memory
His name clipsed of al his old victory
And as he began in pouert and distress
So he made an end in wretchydnesse
Hasty risynge and thrift that is sodeyne
And surmountynge by violent rauyne
And extort power may for a while atteyne
In rich chair of lordship for to shine
Sodeyne ascendynge does suddenly declyne
And by untruth where ever there be encres
Men wait of custum a sodeyn disencres
Of agathodes men may exaumple take
What is the end of every falls tyrant
Wrong clymbinge up does a foul end make
For a ceson though tirauntys be puissaunt
Fortune to them yeueth no longer grant
But when they sit on her whele most royal
By unware change to have a sodeyne fall
Agathodes was first a simple man
Brought forth in mischeef and in pouerte
Son of a potter the story tell can
By vicious living came to great dignite
Of all folk hatyd for his cruelte
Clambe fro pouert up to great richesse
Made pore again dyed in wretchidnesse
Lenuoye
THis story shows a figure
Both by story and by auctorite
How man and be and every creature
Tarageth the stok of his natiuite
Erbe of the rote and each fruit of his tree
For both of virtue and also of outrage
Follows some tetch or taste of the lynage
Agathodes by record of scripture
Borne of low bed brought forth in pouerte
Yet fortune made him to recure
Up to hye estate from full low degree
His reason blent with censualite
Forgate him silf to speak in pleyne langage
Through a falls tatche that came fro his lynage
There is a difference of colors in picture
On table or wall as men all day may se
Twene gold and gold atwene bys and asure
All is not gold that shyneth bright parde
Some noble is false that has full great beutye
Late men be ware of counterfeit coignage
Tetchis eschuynge of chorlissh low lynage
Su^me man forthred of sodeyne adventure
Set in chair of royal dignite
Wenynge his empire ever should endure
Never to be troubled with none aduersite
With royal eglys a kyte may not fle
A Iay may chater in a golden cage
Yet ever sum tetch must follow of his lynage
Gentle blood of his royal nature
Is ever enclyned to mercy and pity
Where of custum these vileyns do their cure
By their usurped and extort falls pouste
To be vengeable by mortal cruelte
Through hasty fumys of furious courage
Following the tetchis of their vileyne lynage
O mighty princes your no bless do assure
Your passions rest with tranquillite
Se how there is no mean of mesure
Where a tyrant catchith the souereynte
Late agathodes your wordly myrroure be
To eschew the tracys of his froward passage
As royal blood requereth of your lynage
How Cassander slough the wif of Alisaundre / and Hercules her son / And
antipater slough his mother and of other murders.
tHe great myscheef of fortunys might
The woeful fallys fro her whele in deed
Of princys princessys who so look aright
Been lamentable and doolful for to read
But for all that bochas does proceed
In his rehersayle remembringe thus him selue
To him apperyd of men and wymen twelve
After the death of king agathodes
There came tofore him worthy queny^ tweyne
The first of them was called Bersanes
And of her myscheef began to him complain
Wife of alisaundre the story list not feyne
The mighty king grettest under son
Which by conquest all this world has won
Wif to alisaundre was this Bersanes
By his live as made is mention
Which with her son named hercules
Were by Cassander brought to destruction
And of her death this was thoccasion
Cassandre dred that Bersanes the queen
Would with her son on him auengyd been
For his tresons which he tofore wrought
On alisaundre and on his lynage
And specially if that she were brought
To macedoyne for her advantage
With her son that was but young of age
Cassander thought and dred as I have told
They would avenge his tresons wrought of old
He cast before of malice causeles
This Cassander most falsely werkynge
That if this knight this young hercules
Son of alisaundre by record of writing
In macedoyne were take and crowned king
How that he would of equite and right
Her faders death avenge like a knight
Which thing to eschew cassander began provide
And by falls fraud was not recheles
But on a day he list not long abide
Slough first the queen this seyde Bersanes
And than her son I called hercules
Thus by cassander of murdre crop and rote
They murdered were there was none other bote
This cruelte might not suffice
Unto alysaundre by record of scripture
But like a tyrant in vengeable wise
He did them burye by froward adventure
Where no man should know their sepulture
And thus alas which pity is to read
He murdryd four out of one kinrede
To alisaundre he ministered the poison
Slough the queen called olimpiades
And of hatrede by full falls treson
As I have told he slough queen bersanes
Wife to alisaundre mother to hercules
Which in youth by bochas rehersinge
In macedoyne was like to have be king
After all this he could not live in pes
But ever ready some treson for to do
Slough eke the queen called Roxanes
Upon a day and her young son to
And she was wif to alisaundre also
Cassandre dredinge in his opinion
List they would venge upon his false treson
Thus ever he lived in murdre sorrow and strif
By way of fraud came all his encres
And as I find how he had a wife
And she was called Thesalonices
And this story remembers doutles
A son they had borne atwene them tweyne
To sle his mother which after did his pain
Shortly to pas mine auctoure writes none other
Antipater was her sons name
And by cause that she louyd his brother
Better than him he to his great diffame
Compassed her death the story seyth the same
Natwithstandinge tappese his cruelte
She asked mercy knelinge on her kne
Her brestys open white and soft as silk
All bedewed with ^yrys her visake
Requeryd mekely at reverence of the milk
With which he was fostred in young age
For to have mercy and tappese his rage
And to accept goodly her prayere
To save the life of his mother dear
But all for naught herd her neueradell
He was to her surmountinge at mesure
Like his fader vengeable and cruel
I trow it was you^ him of nature
For by record of kind and eke scripture
Seelde or never no branch that is good
Springs of custom out of crue^ blood
Of her death cause there was none other
That antipater slou^ (...) mother dear
But for she loved al^ (...) his brother
Better than him the cronicle does us lere
Which alisaundre if ye list to here
Had in his socoure I find by wrytinge
Demetrius that was of asie king
Thesalonices was in this while ded
By antipater he most unfortunate
Bathed in her blood her sides were made read
Without compassion of her hye estate
And her two sons living at debate
Till lisimachus that prefect was of Trace
Them reconsiled each till others grace
When demetrius knew of their accord
God wot the^oth he no thing was feign
But by his fraud the story bears record
That alisaundre maliciously was slain
This while antipater stondinge in no certain
Till he by sleyght of lisymachus
Was murdryd after the story tells thus
To write the process and the manner hough
That Lysymachus by fraudolent werkinge
His son in law antipater thus slough
Falls couetyse was cause of all this thing
And demetrius took on him to be king
Of macedoyne remembered time and date
When both brether were passed in to fate
Duringe this murdre and all this mortal stryf
In this process like as it is found
Of antipater Erudice the wif
Daughter of clenchus was in chenys bound
Cast in prison dyrke hidous and profounde
And for a while I leave her there soiourne
And to Demetrius I will again return
Which made him silf to be crouned king
Of macedoyne through his great puissaunce
But to destroy his purpos in werkynge
There were three princis notable in substance
Consyderate and of alliance
Echon assentyd for short conclusion
To bring Demetrius to destruction
One the first was worthy tholome
King of egypt in arms full famous
Other tweyne the story ye may se
Called Selenchus and next Lisymachus
And of Cipre came the king pirthus
Lord of province as it is eke found
They made them strong demetrius to co^founde
Shortly to tell with their apparayles
Of macedoyne they did him first depryue
Came upon him with four strong batayles
That he was never so ouerset in his live
Take of Lysymachus the story does descryue
Cheyned in prison of his life in doubt
For I not find that ever he issued out
Of the two prefectis / Penestes and a Aman^as
nExt in order Penestes did appear
Whilom prefect of great Babylon
And with him came amantas eke I fere
Another prefect as made is mention
Which Batt^ye had in his suspection
A great province you him by judgment
Myd of Asia toward the occident
These said tweyne for their worthynes
And for their manhood (...) actys mar^iall
Assigned were by diligent besinesse
To write and keep in especial
Upon the mageste in his estate royal
Of alysaundre for trust as chamberleynes
Again thassaute and dread of all foreyns
After whoos death for singular guerdon
Made prefecte both they were in deed
As ye have herd that one in Babylon
That other in Battrye the story ye may read
Yet in quiet they might him not possede
For selenchus began a werre again them make
That they were feign their lordships to forsake
How sandrodoctus borne of low degree cherisshed robbours and thieves
OTer prefectis there were also I find
Which held the people in full great seruage
In macedoyne and in outher ynde
Till sandrodoctus a man of low lyuage
Cast he would redress their outrage
Of intent pore people to restore
To their fraunchises that playned on them sore
Sandrodoctus auctoure of this werkinge
Behight the people throughoute all cuntrees
When he by sleyght was crowned king
Them to restore to their libertees
But when he had received these dignitees
All his behestis made with him a fair visage
Turned as they fond to thraldom and seruage
Thus when a wretch is set in hye estate
Or a beggar brought up to dignite
There is none so proud pompous nor elate
None so vengeable nor full of cruelte
Void of discrecion mercy and pity
For churlisshe blood seelde does recure
To be gentle by weye of his nature
He may dissimule and for a time feyne
Caunterfete with a fair visage
Out of one hoode show facys tweyne
Contrary of heart double of his langage
Still of his port smothe of his passage
Under flowers like a serpent dare
Till he may stynge and he will not spare
And ever like of his conditions
Was Sandrodocius setup in hye estate
Vexyd people troubled Regions
Set citees and tou^s at great debate
Whoos governance was unfortunate
As it was seen and found at all preuye
Cherisshed no man but robbours and the^ys
And to declare how he caught hardynesse
And occasion people to govern
By a pronostyke which I shall express
Right marvelous and uncouth to discern
Which was this as I shall tell as yerne
Right wonderful and uncouth for to here
And it was this if ye li^t to lere
There was a man called procatales
Borne in ynde which of his living
Was wondre pore came but seelde in prees
Because he had trespaced in one thing
Again venandrus that was that time king
Co^maundynge to sle him anon right
But he escapyd the story seith by flight
God had you him of fete swyftnesse
By mean whereof he sauyd him from daungere
Through long travail fill in werynesse
And refressh him beside a well clear
He lay slepynge that face and al his chere
Dropped of sote a lion came forby
Lyckyd his face as seith the story
With which affray the man anon woke
And suddenly lift up his visage
The lion rose softly the wey took
Toward the forest did him no damage
Forgate his felnes and his cruel rage
Of which pronos^yke began thoccasion
Whereof Sandrodoctus took an opinion
Cast and thought in his fantasy
Since that the lion is be most royal
Which not dysdeyned him silf to appli^
To lycke the face of a man rural
In his nature to show him bestyall
He dempt well that it was sittinge
To take on him thestate to be a king
His oppinion of reason was right naught
For where the lion left his cruelte
He in contrary wex proud in heart and thought
Void of mercy bareyne of pite
For when that he was set in dignite
Brought from a wretch to domynacion
Again nature he pleyed the lion
Sumtyme a lion forgets all felnesse
Where as a wulue will naturally devour
So royal blood has ruth on gentylnesse
On pore pleyntifs to help them and socoure
Where as a tyrant of nature does labor
When he has powere catchynge advantage
To rob subiettis and spoil them by pyllage
Sandrodoctus thus borne of low kynrede
In hye estate by fortune when he stood
Began make him strong and vengeable in deed
With noumbre of robbours furious and wode
Cast him destroy all the gentyl blood
That was in ynde and by his ordinance
Sle all the prefectys that had governance
And with the ^u^mons when he was made strong
And began the manner of their death diuyse
Like a falls tyrant all though he did wrong
Again his lordys when he began arise
An Olifaunt came in full uncouth wise
Him obeyed which was a great wondre
When their batailes were not far asondre
Though he was wild the storye seith the same
Sandrodoctus lept upon his side
And on his back as on a be tame
Toward the bateyle anon he began to ride
Was their capteyne that day and their guide
With his robbours as it is made mind
Sloughe all the prefectys and gentle blood of ynde
How Selenchus the mighty prince was slain by the great tholome king of egypt
THan came Selenchus to bochas co^pleynyng
A mighty prince and a manly knight
Son of anthiochus the great famous king
Was most favored in alisaunders sight
With Selenchus for wisdom and for might
Borne of a princess the cronycle ye may seen
Called Leoudice the great famous queen
The birth of him strange and merueilous
For h^s mother upon the same night
That she conceived drempt and thought thus
As it semyd pleynly in her sight
Of great appollo the heuynly god most bright
How she the time of her conceyuinge
Received that night of gold a rich ring
In which ringe was set a precious stone
You unto her for a great guerdon
Grave with ankre her co^maundyng anon
After the birth without dilacion
To give the ringe of hool affection
To Selenchus whereby in especial
He should excel in actys marcyall
The same morrow after the child was borne
Within her bed was found a rich ringe
With all the tokyns rehearsed here toforne
The ankre grave like in every thing
Which that the queen took in her keeping
And of intent for her advantage
Kept it secret till he came to age
Another merueyle fill also withal
This selenchus which was a wondre thing
Had enprented eke in especial
Upon his thigh an ankyr and a ringe
So had all by record of writynge
Such carectes the story does determyne
That after him were borne of that line
When selenchus as made is mention
The tender years had of his age run
And came to yerys of discrecion
He by this ringe full many land has won
Whoos knightly fame shone shene as son
He well auysed herdy of great might
Time of Alisaundre hold one the best knight
In werre and arms he his time has spent
Brought all ynde to subjection
Gate all the kingdoms nigh of the oryent
Held them long in his possession
But here alas bochas makes mention
All his victoryes that did in ho^our shine
With sodeyne change were turned unto ruin
For when selenchus was most victorious
Had all ynde conquered in substance
Atwene him and king Lysymachus
Of whom tofore is made remembrance
Began a werre and a great distaunce
And as they met with their appareyles
In a great field ordained their batayles
On Lysymachus fill the disconfiture
Whereof Selenchus glad in especial
Dempt his winning came not of nature
But by influence verrey celestial
Began wax proud in his estate royal
Not supposinge in his victorious stall
Of his mescheues that should after fall
For as the process declares unto us
How of Egypt the great Tholome
Brother in law to Lysymachus
Fill on selenchus by full great cruelte
Slough him at mischeef the story ye may se
Lost his lif as made is mention
In Macedoyne the mighty region
And it is know of antiquite
By rehersayle of the old auctours
That this forseyde great Tholome
Was to alisaundre one of the enheritoures
King of egypt there regnynge in his flours
After whoos name descendynge down by grees
Were all the kings called tholomees
As I find touching his lynage
By procreacion he had children three
The first of them to speak in plain langage
I named was Ceramyus tholome
Next philadelphus a daughter arcynoe
That weddyd was by her faders consentinge
To licymachus of macedoyne King
How the two sonnys of queen arcynoe were by there moders brother traitourly
slain and she exiled
aNd thus remembryd in bokys old
Death of Selenchus wrought by tholome
Unawarely slain tofore as I have told
Next in order came Arcynoe
To John bochas by great aduersite
All with terys bedewed her visage
And began complain the constreynt of her rage
This mighty queen this said Arcynoe
Had sonnys tweyne full famous of renoun
The tone Lysymachus excellinge of beute
That tothyr philip as made is mention
And her joy and dilectacion
In wordly bliss there is no more to feyne
Was holy set upon these children tweyne
For by thoccasion of their great fayrenesse
Men delited greatly them to se
Namely wymen the story does express
And their mother this queen Arcenoe
Stood in great hope that they should be
Mighty kingis by just succession
In macedoyne the mighty region
Only by the title of their faders right
Which to her heart gave full great gladness
For she dempt that none other wight
To succeed should have none interesse
But fortune the blind falls goddess
Disposyd so for their children tweyne
That none of them purpos should atteyne
For when their fader Lysymachus was slain
The said queen called arcynoe
To save her lif could none other gain
But with her sonnys feerfully to fle
^^to Cassander a mighty strong cite
Only for dread of one antigonus
Which them pursued the story tells thus
But the brother of queen Arcynoe
Called Ceramyus rescued her party
Again antigonus ye may the story se
Yi^ in his heart he had great envy
Albe that they were nere of one allye
That her two sonnys should kings be
Of Macedoyne and regne in that cuntre
For he was set only of couetise
To be crowned in macedoyne king
And of his false treson the story does divise
Them to desceyue this was his werkinge
First to the queen full humbly knelinge
He made promys under great surete
In macedoyne she should crowned be
And her children so fair of their visage
Should be kept under governance
Unto time that they come to age
And for to put her in more assurance
Ceramius swore god give him sorry chance
He purposed for all his false werkinge
To crown her queen and make her sons kings
Took all the goddys there unto witness
And swore again with a pleyne visage
Unto the queen of fraud and doubleness
His purpos was to have her in marriage
Crown her queen to her great advantage
Thus he was sworn all though he was her brother
Yet in heart god wot he thought another
Under color of this assurance
She let him enter Cassandre the cite
Came again him to do him more plesaunce
With all her lords of hye and low degree
Made the stretys hangyd for to be
With clothis of gold and in solemn wise
To all their goddys did sacrifise
And thus he was received solemply
The day was hallowed and hold festyuall
The queen for joy ordained richely
Her two sonnys that were so fair in all
To be crowned with crowns full royal
Goo before her in the master street
Gloriously their uncle for to mete
With felonous heart under a friendly face
This Ceranius rote of all treson
Began his Cosyns benigly enbrace
Him purposinge by falls collusion
To proceed to their destruction
And finally first he did his pain
The queen to exyle and sle her children twyne
But of this treson was brout to a preef
When the queen apperceyued his falsnesse
And saw her sonnys brought to such mischeef
She coniured him in her mortal distress
To have pity of natural gentylnesse
Spare his cosyns before him where they stood
Of royal mercy so nere borne of his blood
And with a cry passing lamentable
She fill before him swownynge unto ground
Like as she had be verily coupable
Seeing her sonnys bledynge with many wound
But all for naught there was no mercy found
For with their blood this story is not feyned
Her garnement was doolfully desteyned
Her face fair was soyled with ordure
Her golden here was all to torn and rent
And like a thrall this woofull creature
With mortal weeping had her sight blent
And after that I find how she was sent
To burye her children for there was no space
Into an isle called Samontrace
Is any story which makes mention
That a princess of so hye degree
Fond so great cause of lamentacion
She being daughter to great Tholome
Her children slain by vengeable cruelte
And to behold the death most dolorous
Of her husbonde called Lysymachus
She after banysshed in exile made her end
With sorrowful conpleynt her lif thus draw alonge
Till into fate her sprite did wend
It is no dread her peynes were full strong
And if I should reherce all the wrong
That she suffered it would grieve sore
Therefore of her now I write no more
Lenuoye.
THis tragedye shows an appearance
And a likeness of feithfull assurance
Excite men to give falls credence
Unto fortunes falls variaunce
Which cast her baytis and anglys of plesaunce
An hoke hyd under of vengeable cruelte
As this chapter put in remembrance
Of lysymachus and of of Arcynoe
Is there any gretter evidence
Of wordly trouble of wordly constaunce
Then se princes from their magnificence
And from their mighty royal puissaunce
Unwarily brought by fortune to mischaunce
And overwhelmed from their tranquilite
Se here a myrroure full notable in substance
Of lysymachus and queen arcynoe
The ringe the ankyr of great excellence
You to Selenchus for marciall suffisaunce
When appollo by heavenly influence
List with his mother make his alliance
Send him these relics of singular acquentaunce
To set his manhood in more suerte
But in all such quaueringe acquentaunce
Think on lysymachus and arcynoe
The uncouth tresours the gold nor the dispense
Of them that have this world in governance
Nor all the subgettys up rekenyd in sentence
Nor all the regions under their obeisaunce
Princys princessys with all their attendaunce
May again fortune give them no liberte
Who not knows her unsure gery chance
Think on Lysymachus and Arcynoe
Her children and she slain by violence
Of Ceramius god give him sorry schaunce
That by falls color did her reverence
And pretended a manner obseruaunce
The treson clos of venymous purueaunce
Purposed before to outray them all three
The children slain which knew no cheuysaunce
The mother exiled called Arcynoe
Noble princis by ware of hye prudence
Among your silf that there be no distaunce
Hyde no rancoure of hatfull violence
Under a curteyne of double daliaunce
Like your heart show out your countenance
Vayde of dissimulinge and duplicite
Wisely wey this chaptre in balaunce
Of lysymachus and queen arcynoe
How Ceramius of macedoyne king that murdryd his cosyns was slain in battle
by the^ of france
tHe noble poet John bochas in his book
Procedinge forth compleyneth of pity
With quaking hand wha^ he his pen took
And began to write the woeful destenye
As ye have herd of queen Arcynoe
And how Ceramyus the story makes mind
Was to her falls traytoure and unkind
Of whoos treson is made a great process
And how he after was slain in battle
Punysshed by vengeance for his great falsnesse
Like as his story makes rehersayle
Which to remember I cast me not to fail
Following mine auctoure and proceed in writynge
How Ceramyus was slain when he was king
For while that he by his false werkynge
In macedoyne had the gouernayle
Three hundryd thousand accounted by wrytinge
Went out of france to conquer Itayle
The host departed in many strong battle
Gate by conquest through their hye renoun
Full many province and many a region
And as they rode through many great cuntre
This people of Gaul in steel armyd clean
They founded castles and many strong cite
Toward rome they bilded Mylan and Seen
Upon Talpies their armoure shone full shene
And su^me of them up to rome went
By very force and the cite brent
Su^me partyd up to the grekissh se
Had a custum to chese their dwellinge place
^y augurie as briddys did fle
Following their flight they began after trace
^oldynge their wey within a little space
With mighty hand the book does specefie
They came to a cuntre called pauonie
This folk of gaul which is called france
To conquer londys put them silf in prees
As most notable people of puissaunce
Following the exaumple of their knightly encres
In their ridynge of worthy hercules
Which was worshipped in their actis marcyall
Like as a god and called immortal
Through grace of fortune in their chyualries
Conqueryd cuntrees alwey forth ridinge
Them self departinge in diverse cu^panies
Who them withstode they consumed by brennynge
Came to Macedoyne where Ceraum was king
Of presumpcion wenynge it should avail
Out of ordenaunce he met them in battle
This Ceramyus of outrage and of pride
Dempt him able to mete with them of france
But for he was through murdre an homicide
^el^^kyd grace and power in substance
Yet they of Gaul by prudent governance
Offered unto him though he was recheles
With macedonoys for to trete of pes
But for presumpcion and malencolye
Again his enmyes he the feelde has take
And disconfited anon was his party
His men began flee and have their lord forsake
His head smet of and set upon a stake
But all his mischeef was to lyte in deed
To recompense his fraud and his falshede
There is no pain again so great offense
May be devised in no book that men read
Equivalent murdre to recompense
Duly to punissh so outraious a deed
Of him that made young children blede
As did Ceraum which of falls couetise
His cosyns slough as ye have herd devise
To think on murdre it is to foul a thing
To god and man hatfull and terrible
The infernal fraud the deuelissh compassinge
To each creature of nature is odible
Which to redress is an Impossible
O cursed Ceraum I leave thy story here
Thy name no more shall blot my papere
How the prince Belgius was disconfited / and brought unto naught
AFter this tyrant as ye have herd the cas
Slain in battle this traytoure odious
Anon in order came to John Bochas
A mighty prince called Belgius
Dedly pale with fa^e furious
Which compleynyd among this woeful prees
His disconfiture done by queen sostenes
This sodeyne mischeef greuyd his heart sore
For all the folk that were in his battle
Were put to flight bochas write no more
Of his knighthode nor of his apparayle
Save only this he makes rehersayle
Of the french host he tells in certain
How he was chosyn for a cheef capteyne
And how he came into the rich land
Of macedoyne with his people of france
Till Sostenes the queen with mighty hand
Disconfyted him brought him to mischaunce
Of whom I find none other remembrance
Save when he wend to have been most glorious
He was outrayed by force of brennyus
How Duke Brennyus delitinge to rob / and stele mischeuously endyd
tHis Brennyus full knightly in werkynge
Which by conquest gate many great cite
And as I read of dens he was king
Despoiled regions and many great cu^tre
Robbed people of hye and low degree
Spared no goddys but by violence
Took their tresour^ did them no reverence
There was a temple great and marvelous
Bilt on a roche and on an hill of stone
Sacryd to appollo called Delphius
In all greece so great a god was none
And often since the people would gone
Up to a Theater which that stood without
To have answer of that they stood in doubt
Their trust their hope was to that god applied
Having to him singular affection
As though he might have help and magnefied
And done to them great consolacion
For by a sprite of falls decepcion
He gave answer of sundry questions
To folk that came from diverse regions
King Brennyus had no fantasy
In their temples after their paynymguyse
Nouther to worship nor to magnefie
Their Grekysshe goddys to do them sacrifyse
For in his heart he began them to despise
Caught a joy with all his false robbours
Them to despoyle and rob of their tresours
Behight his men and seyde in plain langage
That his desire and his entencion
Was to be boty with them of such pillage
As goddys had in their possession
And part with them for singular guerdon
For their labor and great traueyles
That they had had with him in batayles
He gave his people a manner hardynes
Made them trust in great multitude
Having despite of thynnocent simplenes
Of his enmyes because they were but rude
I mean tho folk shortly to conclude
Which had in keeping the Iuels precious
Of great appollo called delphicus
The people also which was with brennyus
Had all the day drunk mighty wynes
To fill their paunches they were so desirous
That they forgate their marciall doctrynes
Tascende the mounteyne feeble were their cheynes
Their hedys toltyr and their brain began fail
The temple aloft to spoil or to assayly
In their assendynge by weyes that they ches
Upon the roche they were beat down
Preestys of the temple put them silf in prees
One bare a standerd another a great penoun
Clad in chesiples for hye devotion
And with their other uncouth apparailes
Both on the roch and low in their batayles
The people of brennyus was incomparable
Spread all the feeld the storye bears wytnes
But it is said of old and is no fable
That no diffence is drunkenes
And wysdom fail where is great exces
And in a friend plainly to conclude
Victory always stantdeth not in multitude
For they were set as bochas does deuyse
Not to knighthode but to falls outrage
To spoil and rob by gredy couetise
And stuf their summers with outraious pillage
Furious ra^yne has brought them in a rage
And farewell knighthode and marciall noblesse
Where couetise is lady and maystresse
Two mighty dukes were with brennyus
Which that were cheef of his counsel
Emanus that one that other thesalorus
Which as they thought to their great avail
Began apurpos and it was disauayle
To rob the people the cuntre and each town
Which turned after to their confusioun
Thus auaryce with stomak vnstauncheable
Has strangled the power of many a worthy knight
And couetise her suster vntretable
Has of hye noblesse fuloft queynt the light
Where tantalus regneth a lion has no might
This to mean hungre and couettousnesse
Turns all noblesse into cowardnesse
For by the counsel of these dukes tweyne
Brennyus set all his opinion
To spoil and rob did his besy pain
To pille the citees of all that region
But in this while as made is mention
Myd their batayles bochas does me lere
The god appollo and pallas did apere
Appollo first showed his presence
Fressh young and lusty as any son shene
Armyd all with gold and with great violence
Entered the feeld as it was well seen
And Diana came with her arowes kene
And Mynerua in a bright habirioun
Which in their coming made aterrible soun
The noise was herd of their bright armure
Which made their enmyes for fere almost to rave
That they might before them not endure
Fled the field for dread them silf to save
And there was herd an hidous erthqua^e
And from heaven in this mortal battle
Of cold constreynynge great stonys began down hail
Their adversaries beat down and grounded
And before them durst not abide
And brennyus so mortaly was woundyd
Both breest and head and hurt through outher side
Loo here the end of couetyse and pride
For Brennyus for constreynt of his smerte
^oue with a dagger him silf to the heart
This was his end vengeable and merueylous
And his dukys sleyne both tweyne
Called Emanus and Thesalorus
The grekissh Goddys began at him so disdeyne
Of sacrilege se here the grievous pain
For to goddys who list do no obseruaunce
Shall unwarily be punysshed with vengeance
It is not holsum with goddys to pleye
Nor their puissaunce presumptuously to attain
For where as they by vengeance list werrey
Who list assay shall find it no game
For his presumpcion Brennyus fond the same
For appollo diana and mynerue
For his outrage unawarely made him sterue
Lenuoye.
THis tragedye declares who list here
Of duke Brennyus many great battle
His extort conquest and holy the manner
How by force rode through all Itayle
After how he the romans did assail
His fall in greece by vengeable violence
For he to goddys would do no reverence
Took all the tresours and Iuels most entere
Out of their temples and richest apparayle
Gold and perle and all that I fere
To his encrees which that might avail
The rich he robbed oppressed the porayle
Of very pomp and froward insolence
And list to goddys do no reverence
This mighty tyrant most surquedous of chere
With couetise brent in his entrayle
Whoos gredy fret there might no mesure stere
Till that fortune at mischeef did him fail
He lackyd might her variaunt whele to nail
Ageyn whoos fall there was no resistance
For he to goddys list do no reverence
Noble princys conceive and do lere
The fall of Brennyus for misgouernayle
And prudently peysynge this matere
Virtue is strenger than outher plate or mayle
Before considred when Brennyus does counsel
Cheef preseruatyf of your magnificence
Is to god to do due reverence
How Pirrus king of pyrothe list not live in pees but of pride and
presumpcion in werre came unto myschaunce
iN bochas book next following on the ring
Came young pirrus son of Gacides
Born by descent to regne and be king
And to enherite the land of pyrothes
Yet in his youth and his tender encrees
The froward people dwelling in that place
Without his gilte began his death purchase
But to preserve him as made is mention
He was committed and take in keeping
Certain yerys for his sauacion
To one Glaucus Illirie king
Whoos wife was cosyn by record of writynge
To the seyde famous gacides
And she in story called Beronice^
He nigh of blood to this noble queen
Both tweyne borne of one lynage
Wonder gracious to all that did him seen
And well favored of fetures and visage
And in the while of his tender age
One Cassander of macedoyne king
Compassed his death by subtle falls werkynge
And his purpos for to bring about
He sent for him by falls collusion
Puttinge Glaucus pleynly out of doubt
But if he came like his entencion
He would work to his distruccion
Gadre people both nigh and far
And on Glaucus gynne a mortal werre
But king glaucus took hereof none head
Having to pirrus so great affeccion
Of him received verreyly in deed
To be his son by adopcion
Purposinge of hool entencion
To make pirrus pleynly if he may
To be his heir and regne after his day
Pyrrus alwey vpgrowynge by encres
Full amyable both of chere and face
And in this while the people of pirothes
Knowing that he stood in glaucus grace
Chaungyd their hertys cast them in short space
For to restore all of one courage
The seyde pirrus to his heritage
Thus by assent he was crowned king
Young fressh and lusty and seemly therwithall
Wonder well thewed in his vpgrowynge
Like his lynage of courage wex royal
The which was cause in especial
He was byloued of friends about
And of his enmyes greatly had in doubt
The name of him began to sprede far
Through all greece about in each cuntre
The land of tarent began in his time werre
Again the romans as ye may se
Requeringe Pirrus that he would be
Favorable and helpinge of intent
To the party of them of tarente
To there request he can condescende
And of purpos cast him not to fail
If that fortune would him grace send
With mighty hand and marciall apparaile
For to be lord and conquer all Itayle
As did his uncle whilom doutles
King alisaundre called of Epirothes
First he began his conquest in Itayle
Toward heraclye a mighty great cite
Where with brennyus he had a great battle
Consul of rome and lord of that cuntre
And to the encres of his felicite
As is remembryd in his storye
Upon romans he gate that victory
The olifauntys with castles on their bak
Caused pirrus the young manly knight
With his wysdom wherein there was no lack
To put his enmyes that day to the flight
And in this while it happened forthright
The Secilians bochas bears record
Among them silf were at discord
There was atwene them great diuysion
Each to other contrary in werkinge
But to refourme their falls descencion
They prayed pirrus to come and be their king
To whoos request he fully assenting
By them made strong list not to differ
Again the romans to gynne a werre
Beside a castle called Esculus
Within Poile his baners he began splaye
The same day not happy nor vrous
Contrarious fortune his power began affraye
Wounded to the death began greatly him dismaye
By which occasion this pirrus anon right
Lept on his courser and took him unto flight
A son he had called Helenus
Borne of the daughter of king agathodes
Whom he ordained mine auctour tells thus
For to be crowned to his great encres
Of Seciliens to regne there in pees
Wenynge thereby to have had advantage
And in this while came to him amessage
Out of Tarent which stood in adventure
For his absence out of that region
If he not came they might not endure
Again the^ powere of them of rome town
Which of assent were descendyd down
Ageyns them they stondynge in despeire
Save in abiding upon his repeyre
PIrrus this while stood in full herd point
Wext abashed and dull in his courage
Atwene tweyne hanging in disioynte
We^reyed of romans hatyd in Cartage
Had a battle to his fynall damage
Within a feelde called arusius
There put to flight by one fabrycus
Destitute by fortune and appeyred
Void of socoure bareyne of richessh
Like a man of hope dispeyred
Toward Epire in haste he began him dress
Where he was first his story does express
As ye have herd rehearsed by writing
By succession whilom lord and king
But he came to Epire the cite
He began of new again antigonus
King of macedoyne a full strong cuntre
Him to werr^y he was so desirous
And by conqueste the storye tells thus
Within a while there was no great lettynge
^y help of fortune he was crowned king
Not seven months regnynge in quiet
By lysimachus maugre all his might
He was put down and remeuyd from his sete
Yet of presumpcion though there was no right
He took on him to gynne a new fight
C^yne lacedomoyns and felly them werrey
Only by cause they would him not obey
Whoos presumpcion when that they took head
Both of prudence and polycie
Wymen were armed to make a large field
With multitude to oppress his party
For common profit put them in Iupartye
And finally such was their ordinance
That seyde pirrus was brought to mischaunce
His son there slain called Tholome
And many other lost there their lives
And for all that of pride and cruelte
He began a werre again the argyues
And at the end of his mortal stryues
For conclusion this was his last fall
Sleyne with a ston as he came to their w^ll
His head smet of in the same place
And thereof made an oblacion
To antigonus for a great solace
Thus list fortune quite his presumpcion
After his werres with many region
Loo here the end of folks recheles
That followed werre and lystnat live in pe^
How the tiraunt Aristotyn by treacherous werkinge set aside the right line was
crowned king of Epyrothes and after slain
fOrth procedynge following John bochas
I will reherce in full pleyne langage
How aristotyn a tyrant this the cas
Cast and compassed by full great outrage
Having no title of right nor heritage
Of Epirothes by treacherous werkinge
Voydynge the line there to be crownyd king
Living two children the story tells thus
Borne by descent to regne in that cite
The eldest of them called was pyrrus
And the second named tholome
And both tweyne by the cruelte
Of arystotyn were falsely set aside
He made king this tyrant through his pride
And while that he thus began occupye
Like a tyrant cruel and vengeable
Of falls rancoure and malencolye
Slough all the Cytesyns that were most notable
And exylyd this story is no fable
Only of malice within his heart cloos
All that were contrary unto his porpos
Unto the wymen by fraudolent sentence
He made ordeyne after that anon
Of feyned pite gave to them license
To their frendys freely for to gone
With their richesses but they were euerichon
By his bidding and by his false treson
Take by the weye and fetryd in prison
Or they were ware was set on them a reest
And after that of vengeable cruelte
The children slain soukinge at their breest
Maydyns oppressed of their virginite
But in this while at Cypre the cite
There was a knight passing of great age
Which cast of purpos tauenge his outrage
The same knight mine auctoure tells thus
In the story plainly as I read
Was in greek tunge called Ballanicus
Right wise and manly both in werre and deed
And things tweyne put him out of dread
To execute his purpos in certain
Maugre all tho that would be him again
For common profit he drad not to be deed
A cause was this for he was fall in age
And a nothir that put him out of dread
For he no children had of his lynage
His quaryll rightful gave him advantage
And herupon gadred him of new
Such as he knew that manly were and true
This purpose hold with circu^specte auys
And thereon made full prudent ordinance
This Bellanicus old hardy and right wy^
Before provided by knightly purueaunce
The said tyrant brought unto mischaunce
By help of them that were to him assentyd
Unwarily slain whoos death was not repentyd
How queen Arcynoe for the auoutry done with Demetrius husbonde of her daughter
Beronyces ended in sorrow.
aFter this story bochas began apply
To turn his pen like as ye shall here
To write and tell the froward lecherye
Of Arcynoe plesau^t of look and chere
Which of her port and eke of her manner
Was in her days like as it is found
For craft and beutye called venus the secounde
For her fairness youen in marriage
To noble agas of Cyrenes king
Atwene them while they were young of age
They had a daughter by record of writynge
Called Beronices the king at his ending
In his testament bad that she should be
Wedded to the son of king tholome
And this was done of entencion
To cese the werrys that had endured long
Atwene Egypt as made is mention
And the Cyrenes both realms strong
By this marriage that he might vnderfonge
In his dyinge to set a fynall pes
Twene these two realms for their both e^icre^
After whose death thus the matter stood
Queen arcynoe most subtle in werkynge
Again this matter so cruel was and wode
Married her daughter without more lettinge
Called Beronices ageyns the bidding
Of her fader that called was agas
As here tofore rehearsed is the cas
She married her to one demetrius
That brother was by bochas rehersinge
Unto the mighty great antigonus
Being in greece of macedoyne king
But unfortunate was after her wedding
As in this story suynge ye shall se
By the false werkynge of queen Arcynoe
And to conclude shortly this matere
When this queen this double arcynoe
Saw of demetrius the visage and the chere
His look his color his langage and beute
His manly port and his liberalyte
She was enamored of her flesshly falls plesaunce
Like her desire to have his aqueyntaunce
Of her nature she was most lecherous
And of her froward inclynacion
She brought about that Demetryus
Assentyd was by her suggestion
For to accomplissh like her opinion
All her desires of flesshly appetyte
Thus of acorde there followed their delight
Left his wife called Beronyces
The queen's daughter and again all right
In a place secret out of prees
They lay togedre almoost every night
Taking no head of god nor of no wight
Till of fortune the cas is so befall
That he was hated of his knights all
Despyte they had of arcynoe
The deed horrible when they did espy
His wife Beronices eke when she did se
Holy the manner of their rebaudie
In heart she caught a great malencolye
Ordained knightys in steel armyd bright
In their auoutrye to take them on a night
Lyenge abed slept and oak no keep
After falls lustys which t^hey had used
They fill upon them even when they sleep
The deed open might not be excused
To all the world thus they were accused
With swerdys draw the knights thilke night
To slay them both were purposed anon right
Out on Beronices cries John Bochas
Because she bad spare Arcynoe
Ground rote and gynnynge of this horrible ca^
Seyde her mercy was very cruelte
To save suchon it was a falls pite
As seith mine auctour a thing contrarious
Her to preserve and sle Demetrius
O Beronices small is thy discrecion
To save the queen that has thy treson found
First to Demetrius she gave occasion
For which she should have had the first wound
Take for them both and in cheynes bound
And after that this false Arcynoe
To exaumple of other should have punisshed be
And while they were takyn thus in cloos
The said arcynoe made no delay
^ut fro her bed anon she up arose
Without ^lothy^ nakyd as she lay
Ran to their swerdys in all their great affray
Went atwene them did her besy pain
To bear of strokys with her armies tweyne
To save demetrius nakyd as she stood
Void of all dread did her besy cure
^^r white body al bespreynt with blood
^an to cry out on every creature
Alas quod she late me alone endure
Death by mysifl ye be to despitous
To save my life and sle demetrius
To the earth anon she fill adoun
To stand up right she might not sustene
Deed pale and wan with many pytous soun
Death of demetrius began woefully by mean
Enbrasinge him with all his woundys grene
And in her armies albe that he lay deed
She kyssed his mouth cold blewe and nothing read
In sorrow* and compleynt thus she made an end
I write no more of this arcynoe
But to Beronices again I will now wend
For bochas seith in the storye ye may se
She after weddyd to worthy tholome
Like as it was her faders first intent
When he dyed and made his testament
Finis libri quarti
Incipit liber quintus Here Bochas write against them that delight in beutye and
semelynesse / calling to purpos how a man borne in Tuscan which excelled in
beutye and fairness: and for his beutye should not give other occasion to
sin he disfigured his visage and body with many a great wound and spot
hEre John bochas scorneth and has disdeyn
Of three manner folk he did se
In this world which that in certain
Set al their joy and al their felicite
For to excelle in fairness and beutye
Not withstanding as ye well tell can
It has undone full many a worthy man
Record he takes of demetrius
Which in his time was fairest in certain
Which caused him to be contrarious
To all virtue his story ye have seyne
But of tho folk bochas has most disdeyne
That besy been to conquer and recure
Beute by craft which comes not of nature
The third is he that grutcheth again kind
For lack of statute and of semelynesse
And all these Three been ignorant and blind
And again reason their coroges they up dress
Yet above beutye virtue is maystresse
And little worth is fayrenesse in certain
In a person where no virtue is seyne
Unto purpos he tells of a man
That excelled all other in fairness
Called Spurnya and borne was in tuscan
And folk had joy and great gladness
To behold him for his semelynesse
Whoos beutye brought wymen in dotage
When they cast her look on his visage
Wives maydyns dwelling in that cuntre
Presyd fast on him to behold
By thoccasion of his great beutye
Not only young but su^me that were old
With louys axcesse now were they hot now cold
Thus was his beutye to many creature
Found in effect a perilous lure
Husbondys old caught a fantasye
And had a manner suspection
Steryd by the serpent of falls I^losye
Toward spurnia as made is mention
But for to avoid all cruel occasion
Of any people that such malis thought
Ye shall here how wysly that he wrought
To put away falls dilect acion
And all occasions of Cupidis rage
He of prudence and discrescion
With many wound diffaced his visage
For he dempte it was great damage
That by thenchoson of excellent beutye
Any creature hindered should be
Philosophers and poets that were wise
Gave unto him a great commendacion
That he could so notably divise
To find away within his reason
To set aside all occasion
Of such unlawful flesshly fantasy
That might stere woman to lecherye
He knew before and saw by experience
That all beauty shall waste away and fade
Like somerfloures in their most excellence
That grow on hyl^is and low down on the shade
The rose the lyllye when they be most glade
Upon their stalks their pref is daily seyn
Been Betyn down with a stormy reyne
And semblably in every creature
Of low degree or of hye estate
B^utye abide not nor longer does endure
Than youthys ceson with age is full chekmate
Who thinks heron I hold him fortunate
And can before in his reason cast
No wordly beutye in earth may alwey last
Lenuoye.
yE wordly folk that rejoice in beauty
Se with the iyen of your aduertence
How with a small sodeyne infirmyte
When death and age list show their presence
Disteyne all fresshnesse with unware violence
Again whoos might there is none other grace
Process of yerys all beutye does difface
Though demetrius was fair upon to se
As ye have herd rehearsed in sentence
Geyne law and right he louyd arcynoe
Thoccasion found by her falls insolence
Because reason made no resistance
Not aduertinge how every hour and space
Process of yerys all beutye does difface
Full horrible was their iniquite
And tofore god hateful their offense
For through falls lust and censualit^
Lost was the bridell of inward providence
Sharp mortal sword made the recompense
Drownyd in terys when she did him enbrace
With blody woundis disfigured all his face
O noble princys late this story be
A clear myrroure to your magnificence
Therein considred the false fragilite
Of wordly fairness which is but appearance
And transitory but so be that prudence
Govern the passage vicious lust to enchace
Process of yerys all beutye does difface
How the two brethren Selenchus and antiochus each desy / rous to excelle other
/ fill at discord endid in mischief
THere is no man that can in story read
Of more mischeef nor of more debate
That of debate that is atwene kinrede
Twene blood and blood geyne kind unfortunate
Namely in persons which been of hye estate
As it fill onys the storye beryth record
Atwene two brether that were at discord
That one selenchus antiochus the the other
As the story heraftir shall divise
Each desirous for to excelle other
And wordly worship and wondirly they were wise
And both blent by wordly couetise
For to clymbe up to hye estate
Which caused them to be at debate
Both mighty kings bochas makes mention
And of one womb soothly they were borne
Under a cursed fell constellacion
Of froward sede may grow no good corn
And through couetise both they were lorne
And destroyed by the mortal werre
That was atwene them in asie nigh and far
It is to me very contagious
To read the batayles and dissencions
The false promyses of anthiochus
With the desceytes and conspiracions
Brethern of birth and of conditions
Contrarious weys ever they did wend
Froward their gynnyng froward mas their end
Their mother was called Leodices
And in Asia Selenchus was regnynge
Ever at werre coud not live in pes
And in surry anthiochus was king
And among robbours they made their endinge
Where ever they faught in wrong or in right
Never they bode but took them to flight
Though selenchus was at his gynnynge
Shynynge in glory and in hye prowess
And of asie he was lord and king
With great diffame was dyrked his noblesse
By cause that he of great unkindness
Full falsely slough without Judgment
His younger brother that was Innocent
And by the bidding of leodyces
Which was his modre of hatfull cruelte
Falsely to murdre the queen Beronices
Wife to the king called Tholome
Regnynge in egypt but it stood so that he
For all his power failed of his pray
Because that she was ware and fled away
Yet afterward of old hate and envy
This Selenchus by full falls treson
Murdered Beronices by conspiracy
Her son also as made is mention
The sclaundre arose through many a region
And was reported unto his diffame
Where through he lost his worship and his name
And on this murdre avenged for to be
For the orryble great abusion
The king of Egypt the said tholome
Began make him strong and came with people down
But for there was so great discencion
Through all his land the story seith certain
He was co^streyned to return home again
Selenchus than made a strong arm
Gadred ships stuffed them with vitayle
Toward asie he takyn has these
But such tempest began his people assail
That hertes and power of them began fail
With thundrynge lightnynge vengeably distreyned
To take the land of need he was constreyned
The people of asie seeing this myscheef
Had of selenchus great compassion
And there socoure to set at a preef
They him received into that region
Though it stood as made is mention
That before time for his cruel deed
They had his person in full great hatrede
And for he fond fortune favorable
Not considrynge her mutabylite
He cast of rancoure for to be vengeable
And gynne a werre again tholome
His men outrayed he was made to fle
Knew no refute nor socour of none other
But for great myscheef sent to his brother
I mean his brother called antiochus
Behestynge him for to croune him king
Of all asie his story tells thus
Took truse this while by subtle falls werkynge
With tholome for ten year endurynge
And when his brother came with his powere
Falsed his promys double of heart and chere
Thus of new they fyl at debate
Each began other mightyly werreye
Falls couetise to encres their estate
Caused that nouther list other obey
Met in a feelde there is no more to seye
Faught hand for hand their hostys both two
Selenchus sled as he was wont to do
Thus a falls werre of hatred fraternall
Again nature set them at discord
Each besy was in especial
As their story remembers by record
Never their life to be at one accord
But when Selenchus was thus put to flight
The people of surrye began deem anon right
That he that day was outher take or deed
And Gallocreis a people of great pouste
Of couetise began have them full great speed
To enter asie and spoil all that cuntre
To antiochus they had eke enmyte
That he was feign for his saluacon
To pay to them a full great raunson
Their heart was you only to pillage
Taking of him of gold great quantite
And he seeing of robbynge the outrage
Drough to the pyllours and one of them was he
And through all asie they robbed each contre
For Selenchus they began so purchase
That he not durst abide in no place
Than Antiochus drough to tholome
Void of saucconduyt or any assurance
Though that atwene them was great enmyte
For a seson as made is remembrance
To have found socoure in his great greuaunce
But all for naught for in conclusion
Tholome him took and cast in derke prison
There constreyned of necessite
Knowing no mean to make his raunsoun
By a woman that lived in pouerte
He was help out of that derke prisoun
Lo here of fortune a falls condition
That could make a thing without ^ere
Of woman to stand in daungere
To proud folk this may be a mirroure
To se a prince thus suddenly brought low
That shone in riches like an emperor
Which of disdeyne list no man to know
Now is he cast now is he overthrow
Now has he cause to pleyne weep and mourn
Knowing no friend for socour him to turn
He was afferd to hold his passage
By hye weyes or for to come in sight
Fill among theuys and they by great outrage
All merciles they slough him anon right
And his brothir for all his great might
Called Selenchus which was a great wonder
Fyl from his courser and brake his neck asonder
How the noble queen Leodomya was in the temple slain: and vengeance take
upon him that slough her.
Six of estates princis and princessys
Showed them bochas pitously pleyninge
To him declarynge their mortal heuynessys
And first of all there came to him weeping
The noble queen her sorrow rehersinge
Called Leodomya which with full heavy chere
Compleynyd the mischeef of her sustre dear
Called Nereis young and tender of age
That weddyd was of cicile the king
And on the day of that great marriage
There fill a stryf and a great meuynge
Among the commons by a manner risinge
That when the queen thereof had a sight
To dianis temple anon she took her flight
The people was perty and rose again the king
For which rumoure and sodeyne strife
Leodomya full feerfully quakynge
Ran to the temple for to save her life
Supposinge in her Imaginatif
That for the temples chaste reverence
Men would spare to do their violence
But there was one by whom the strife began
And was first ground of this great mocion
Called Milo a falls cecilian
Void of all reverence and devotion
Ran to the temple feerser than lion
And where the queen the altar did enbrace
With a sherpe sword slough her in the place
This sacrilege was punisshed by vengeance
Goddys were wroth through this great offense
And Diana by full great displesaunce
Made in the court a soden pestilence
And Milo was by unware violence
Turned bestyall made wode in that affray
And slough him silf suynge the twelve day
How cleomens king of macedoyne was slain with his wife and children
AFter this vengeance takyn on milo
Came cleomene^ of macedoyne king
And to boch^s began show his dedly woo
His great Injuries of enmyes assaylinge
His hye emprises his kingdom defending
And aldirlast how he in his cite
Was by the son slain of Tholome
First in his cuntre the story does devise
Again his enemies he had a great battle
Of his people defendinge the fraunchise
Of knightly prowess as he that lift not feyle
For his right to fight in plate and mayle
His liegys echon being of one assent
To live and dye with him in their intent
Men and wymen and children young of age
Were in one heart as in that matere
Which made them strong and gate great advantage
That vndeuyded they stood echon I fere
Of one courage of one will and of one chere
Greatly assured in their opinyon
Because among them was no division
Their common profit they did no more prefer
Than they did tresoure life or good
For their fredom ay ready to the werre
Not aferde to spend their own blood
And finally so to gydre they stood
That of one thought each began him ready make
To live and dye for his brothers sake
That had an enmy borne of that region
The name of whom was antigonus
And he had weddyd the book makes mention
The old queen of king demetryus
And had her son the story tells thus
Called philip for youth in his keeping
Thereby pretendynge a title to be king
Of Lacedomonoys cleymed again right
There to regne and take possession
Like a tyrant usurping of great might
For to be crouned in that region
But for all his false presumpcion
He was put of and Iset aferre
Though he with them held a mortal werre
And Cleomenes that was rightful king
Was in the feeld armyd every d^y
Hardy as lion dred him nothing
Geyn his enmyes he stood so at a bay
That fro the feeld he made them fle ^way
His dredefull sword ground was so kene
That to abide him they might not sustene
And on a day descendynge ^is cite
Held in the feeld a full strong battle
With lityll people made his ^one to flee
Retournynge home full weary of travail
Thought in his heart that it should avail
To stynte the werre hanging in no certain
Till that his people refresshed were again
Set ordenaunce through all the cuntre
Geyn all enmyes to make resistance
And in to Egypt he goth to tholome
With wif and children withdrawynge his presence
There receyuyd with great benyuolence
Like his estate out of care and dread
And there abode till tholome was deed
But the son of king tholome
Which regnyd after by sucession
Of falls envy and vengeable cruelte
Slough Cleomenes in that region
His wife his children void of compassion
Alas it was to strange a cruel thing
Within a kingdom to murdre so a king
Of king Nero Cornelye and Haniball
AFter whoos death thus wrought by violence
The story remembers procedynge
Forth came nero and showed his presence
Of Siracuse the mighty strong king
Tofore bochas full pitously pleynynge
Besechinge him with a full pitous chere
Of his mischeef to write the manner
The which nero wylfull and furious
List to presume of falls rebellyon
For to debate with appius Claudius
And to malign again rome town
But he anon for his presumpcioun
Constreyned was in all his most pride
Like a cowarde to fle and not abide
No More of him mine auctoure writes here
But in his book as he does proceed
There came Cornelye of rome a consulere
Him silf compleynynge of the great falshede
Which unto him accomplisshed was in deed
By assurance broke of hanyball
Which of cartage was cheef admiral
To this cornelie hanyball was sworn
With the Affricanes by a manner flaterye
To socoure him as we have told to forne
With the romans to hold up his party
But when they met the book does specefie
Cornelye was take and fetred in prison
At mischeef dyed there gained no raunson
Than hanyball entered of intent
With his knights into a great cite
Of Cecile called Agrigent
Where Julius Silua of old enmyte
Laid a siege with a great meyne
That he constreyned the seyde hanyball
For very hungre to lepe over the wall
By a posterne he took him to the flight
Gadred ships and took the large see
And Julius Sylua like amanly knight
Faught with him and made him for to flee
Upon the water anon after he
Was of his knights stoned to the death
And so constreyned he yeldyd up the breath
Of the Duke zantipas cast into the se
AFter that hanyball was slay^e thus
And put to flight as m^de is mention
Tofore Bochas came worthy zantipus
A famous duke full notable of reno^
And he was lord of the strong reg^^
Lacedomoyne and was come afer^e
In to cartage to help them in the wer^^
^y whoos prowess to his e^^res of glory
The proud romans were put to flight
Cartagmensis had of them victory
And there was take the wise manly knight
Marchus Regulus and brought anon right
Into Cartage and led as prysonere
By zantipus as bochas writes here
This noble duke for all his hye prowess
Done in cartage and showed to their town
And for all his notable kindness
They most unkindly quyt him his guirdoun
For seylynge home toward his region
In a ship stuffed of their cuntre
Of falls envy they cast him in the se
To his noblesse and famous chiualrye
When he of knighthode sat highest in his flowers
They of cartage by hatred and envy
Maligned ageyn him cheef son of their socours
Taclipsyd his light but therageyne auctours
Have by writing perpetuelly set his name
And it regestred in the house of fame
How Marchus regulus of his fre will dyed for the common well
wHo can tell or reherce the ground of werrys
The first cause of such mortal outrage
Where it began by influence of sterrys
Twene man and man or of wylfull rage
Atwene romans and folks of cartage
To great hindrynge considred the manner
Of both pertyes as bokys does us lere
Italicus therewith were greuyd often
Namly when fortune was their adversary
And Affricans felt full vnsoft
When she to them list be contrary
Whoos course of custom stou^demele does vary
By experience it has be proved well
In the ouerwhelmynge of her untrusty whele
The most worthy and the most famous
Before remembered upon each party
Fortune to day made them victorious
And to morrow she did their might diffye
Now up now down all stood in Iupardye
Like as she list them favor nigh or serre
Their loss their winning called fortune of werre
To su^me well wylled happy and eurous
To su^me also full strange of aqueyntaunce
Rekne among ot^e^ Marchus Regulus
On romayn party and prince of great substance
To be preferred and put in remembrance
One the most worthy and true fond in deed
Of knightly polycie that I can of read
To common profit was ay his aduertence
Twene love and hate stondynge so upright
To nouther side declyne^ the balaunce
Of his domys for favor of no wight
Till that the iye of his inward sight
Conceived had where the troth stood
Than gave he sentence and thereon he abode
In all this world there was no better knight
Better named and borne of good lynage
A seemly person deliver and of great might
Hardy as lion right manly of visage
Wall of the romans sharp yerde to courage
Demure not hasty seeing all thing to forne
And in papinia I find that he was borne
And for he had so great discrecion
This worthy knight this marcus regulus
Chosyn he was a consul of the town
And had a fellow called maulius
In arms manly wise and virtuous
Which for their notable expert hye constaunce
Of romayn werrys had the governance
Their ships stuffed made a great arm
Full prudently with knightly apparayle
These princis tweyne taken have the se
First with Sicilians had a great battle
Disconfyted them and their arriuayle
Outrayed Amulchar the story is no fable
That was of affryk capteyne and cunstable
That in that cuntre castellys many one
Took prisoners stuf and great richesse
And all that party to rome he sent anon
By Maulius the story bears witness
And the romans for his worthynesse
All of assent by cause he was so wys
Prolongyd have the term of his offis
Of knightly noblesse was none to him like
Nouther in arms nor pollitik ordinance
And for the conquest of cartage and affrike
To him they gave of both the governance
Brought citees touns to his obeysaunce
Of the romans this noble worthy knight
Where ever he rode maugre their foos might
By his feithfull laborious diligence
Gate all the cuntrees to Cartage town
Till tidinges came unto his presence
Beside a river there was a great dragou^
So orryble as made is mention
That all the cuntre of him stood in such doubt
No man durst neigh him far about
An hundred fete and tweyne was his length
Like as writes titus leuius
Was none so hardy man nor of such strength
That durst approach he was so venymous
But by the manhood of marchus regulus
Slain was this monstrous serpent
And for amerueyle the skyn to rome sent
Thus in conquest while he did his pain
To get castles and mighty strong to^s
Ageyn him were sent astruballys tweyne
Called of affrik the hardy champions
With all the power of their regions
But as the story makes rehersayle
They were disconfyted both in battle
Amulchar after came with spear and shield
In diffence of affrik and cartage
And he was also distressed in the feelde
With all his ^s^e maugre his visage
Thus marchus had always the vauntage
Making the romans this knight most virtuous
Through his prowess to be victorious
And where that he in his tender age
List do labor and tylle his own land
For exercise and virtuous advantage
To hold the plough and led it with his hand
Avoiding sloth as ye shall understand
Now through all affrik with many worthy knight
In steel and mayles he rides armyd bright
Thus noble mark what ever he had ado
He was in arms sovereign syngulere
And in the temple at rome of appollo
For him was kept a crown of fressh laurere
Forged of gold fret full of stones clear
And in the temple of Iouis was reserved
A robe of victory which he has deserved
To these goddys who can considre well
Of old custom the rightes to mayntene
As for a thing being perpetuell
Which fades never of nature thus I mean
I sacryd is the fressh laurer grene
For causes tweyne granted to conquerours
In marciall acts by conquest made victours
For the noblesse of this tree dyuyne
Shows his odoure in wisdom and excellence
By the grenesse which never does declyne
Long abiding of virtuous prudence
The round crown betokens providence
In sign only of knightly governance
Takes his guerdon of long continuance
Their strength only granted them not the croun
Nor a proud gynnynge stablissheth not their glory
But persyueraunce who list muse and roun
Grants to them and puts in memory
The triumph and palm of their victory
The crown of laurer in story it is told
And of Jupiter the rich crown of gold
Who can discern of all these gifts ^hre
Most apperteyneth unto chiualrye
Manly prowess wisdom anon late se
Strength hardynesse conquest policy
For the romans caught a fantasy
For his merytes notable and glorious
To magnefie this Marchus regulus
For this marchus during his lusty years
Prince of the werres gayn affrik and cartage
Took all their young knights prysonerys
Sent them to rome for common advantage
But o alas when he was fall in age
The gery gods among her chaunges all
Again this prince her favor made appall
For to withstonde the prowess of this knight
In help of affrik as made is mention
Came zantipus of whom I spoke now right
A mighty duke the which was sent down
Fro Lacedomoyne which through his hye renoun
When the powere of marchus began to fail
His meny slain took him in battle
Into Cartage sent him prysonere
And there he lay in strong cheynes bound
Loo how fortune change can her chere
Falseste of trust when she is most iocounde
First favorable after froward found
This her manner with her double face
Folk that sit highest to change them fro their place
For he that whilom had in subjection
Almost all affrik and Cartage the cite
Now lies he bound and fettred in prison
Whilom in glory now in aduersite
Cast in myserie from hye prosperity
Fortunes be made who look well
Of brotyll glass rather than of stele
This manly knight albe that he lay cheyned
Which had brought rome to so hye encres
That they of affrik and cartage were constreyned
Unto romans to pursue for a pes
And for taccomplissh this matter doutles
Under assurance made in cartage town
They took marchus anon out of prison
Bound by his oath there is no more to seyne
He to be chaungyd for affrik prysonerys
There for to abide and they to cu^me ageyn
The young knights fressh lusty of their cherys
So that Marchus feeble and old of yerys
By affricans were to rome sent
Both assured to accomplyssh their intent
For the romans had in such deynte
This noble mark for manhood and prudence
And for the furthrynge of their comonte
They had his person for wysdom in reverence
Called in that town their wall and their diffence
Had in more cheerte for knighthode in that age
Than all their prisoners of affryk and cartage
Romans greatly reioysed of his cu^mynge
And specially for his delyueraunce
All atonys of heart and true menynge
Said welcome home our joy and our suffisaunce
Welcu^me merour of knightly governance
This was their vois and this was their langage
At his repair fro affryk and cartage
And thus received like to his estate
And conveyed through all the cite
Nobly presentyd unto the Senate
Began his tale anon as ye shall se
As he that had more in cherte
The common profit than his delyueraunce
Said unto them these wordys in substance
Syres by the auys of you echon present
First by the estatys next by the comonte
As prince and consul to affryk I was sent
And as ye know seuyn year there I have be
To chastyse rebels of that cuntre
And by the favor and help of goddys might
To your cite aquyte me like a knight
In this matere it needs not to tarry
Ye know your silf I am now wexen old
And fortune is to me contrary
Whereby your enmyes in affrik be made bold
And they desire me for to be sold
In eschaunge by short conclusion
For prisoners which they have in the town
And by the favor of goddys hye in heuene
And by fellows wise mediacion
Cuntrees and prouincys more than six and seuene
I have in affryk made subiet to this town
Maugre their might and their rebellion
And them constreyned like as desire
For to obey unto your empire
To make your empire more stately glorious
And to encres the bounds of your cite
Whilom by grace I was victoryous
Venquysshed your enmyes where ever I did them se
Now through fortunes mutabylite
Made unhappy and desolate of chere
Sumtyme a prince and now a presonere
Before my power by fortune was fraunchised
Now am I thrall and fetryd in prison
Mine old triumphs be newly now disguysed
And victories oppressed and borne down
With this considred the transmutacion
Of youth passed and mine unwieldy age
Little wondyr though dull be my courage
Yet there is a thing that draws alength my life
Which in my heart has set great gladness
To your encres how this mortal strif
By my labor and knightly business
The marciall princis famous in worthiness
With all the knights most souereyne of renoun
Sought through affryk be now in your prison
By whoos absence feblyd is Cartage
The cuntre porisshed brought to disencres
Seeing that I am dull and fall in age
Geyne affricans to put my silf in prees
Causynge your enmyes pursue for the pes
By eschaunce of me that may but small avail
For affrik knightys most expert in battle
They stand in hope of their delyueraunce
By eschaunge of me now sent out of prison
Of intent to encres their puissaunce
Of new to gynne a werre upon your town
Now take good head and discrecion
Peyse of prudence this thing that I have told
Their youth considred and I am feeble and old
I am consumyd and weryd in the werrys
Fortune contrary I feeble to bear armure
They lusty fressh their name spread full far is
And in the feelde they able to endure
I unwieldy and like a creature
More semble to draw home to my grave
Than be armed this cite for to save
And in effect I have more cheerte
Of very feyth without variaunce
Unto the profit of your comonte
Than to the matere of my delyueraunce
To things peysyd and weyed in balaunce
Of affrik knights expert worthynesse
In me the constreynt of agys feblenesse
And to conclude upon this matere
I might neuir as seems unto me
As of knighthode deserve the laurere
Nor the triumph in this famous cite
Better than dye tenere^e the comonte
And thus auised of heart and hole courage
Yield up the spirit of mine unwieldy age
In this purpos he steadfast as a wall
Of one will and one perseueraunce
Him silf commending to goddys Immortal
Chase for to dye of polityk constaunce
And to prefer by notable purueaunce
The common profit this was his motyf
Set aside god^ his tresour and his lif
Right well chered stable of his visage
Of perfect love he had unto the town
He is repaired again unto Cartage
The articles kept and the condition
At the departing from affrik region
This to sey texplete their lust certain
Or presoner he for to resort again
At his departing the romayn senators
Began wex pale of compassion
To se the pauys of all their old socours
As pr^soner depart out of the town
Princessis ladies fill a swone down
Children wept and cried for pity
Farewell vpholder cheef wall of their cite
Was ever found any truer knight
Which of his own feithfull mocion
Where he was fre and had power and might
To have stand at large by his eleccion
To keep his promise repeyred to prison
What shall I write of his nobles or show
To find one like him I read but afewe
And when he came again with his message
Knowing thentent of this worthy knight
Most furiously the people of cartage
In the presence of every manner wight
Ordeynyd have to turment anon right
First the ledys of his iyen twain
They cut them of to encrece his pain
That he not should sleep in prison
But ever watch with pain intolerable
And for the tonstreynt of his passion
Cry and compleyn with sighs lamentable
And after this took a plain table
Fret full of nails sharp whet and ground
And thereupon nakyd they him bound
Another table they laid on him aloft
Nailed also and atwene these tweyne
They couchyd him this bed was full soft
Most importable so hidous was the pain
The blood ran out of every senowe and vein
This was his turment alas a cruel death
Of worthy marchus till he yield up the breath
Who red in books or ever did se
Of any princis so steadfast and so stable
As whilom were in Rome the cite
Or in their conquest so long perdurable
Of virtue found of courage vnstauncheable
Rekne up all that euere were in that town
And to this marchus make no comparison
Rekne kamillis papyres scipions
Notable worthy for many great victory
Rekne up all the worthy champions
Cursius Fabricus famous of memory
But this regulus eclipsith all there glory
And surmounteth by report of renoun
All these forsayde in comparison
Rekne up the four that whilom were so rich
The first of them called Lucius
Other tweyne of condition liche
As was Staurus and gaius delius
And forgete not the great Emelius
But for all their great possession
Make to marchus no comparison
Remember of crassus of whom it is told
The assirens to staunche his couetise
Poryd in his throat stranglyd him with gold
So he dyed the story does deuyse
And though these four wend have be wise
Greatly commendyd through falls opinyon
Of them to Marchus make no comparison
Touching this mark let men behold and se
He left his tresoure fredom and richesse
And for the profit of the comonte
Forsook his frendys Bochas bears witness
To fordre his town dyed in distress
To keep his feith resorted to prison
Make of none other to him comparison
Mine auctour here put in remembrance
Su^me that had gold stonys and perre
Su^me that had of richesse habundaunce
And of other that stood in dignite
And su^me that had worldly prosperity
Set all aside and conclude of reason
Twene them and marchus is no comparison
Pryncis may live after their ententys
After their lusts and their delices
Of gold and purpur were rich garnementes
After their power frowardly in vices
Grant their Ministres great offices
Twene all their pomp and vain ambycion
And atwene mark make no comparison
All these things remembryd in certain
Well considryd and I put in mind
There was in rome but few such seyn
To common profit that found was so kind
And till I may such another find
In all this book turnynge up so down
I will to him make no comparison
Lenuoye
THis tragedye who that can take heed
Is entermedlyd with woe and gladness
Joy for worship and singular manhede
That was in mark by exellente noblesse
To read his fall it is great heaviness
Which chase to dye where as he stood fre
Only for profit of the comonte
To keep his oath plainly as I read
Made in Cartage there being in distress
This noble prince constreyned of no need
But of frewyll mine auctour does express
Fro rome again thydre began him dress
To suffer turment of his fre volunte
Only for profit of the comonte
This story should crowned be in deed
With golden letters for to bear witness
How seyde mark having of death no dread
To set rome fro werre in sekyrnesse
Whoos hye renou^ most souereyne of prowess
May neuir eclipse by none antiquite
Which chase to dye to forther the comonte
He deseruyd for to have the mede
Of triumph and marciall worthiness
And of Jupiter to were the purpyll wede
Fret full of stonys most heuynly of brightness
The laureat crown conseruynge his grenesse
Granted to victours who list considre and se
Which chase to dye for the comonte
Noble princis which that govern and led
All wordly people take heed in your hynesse
To this storye true as is the creed
Taking exaumple do your business
Ay to supporte and mayntene rightwisnesse
And late Marchus to you a myrrour be
Which chase to dye to furthre the comonte
How Tholome king of Egypt called Phylopater slough fader and mother and his
wif in lechery spente his life and mischeuously endyd
Next in order to bochas compleynynge
Vicious of life there came tholome
Called philopater and was of egypt king
In tender age by horrible cruelte
Slough fader mother and suster ye may se
He to be crowned it is made mention
To regne alone in that region
He was disposyd unto every vice
Froward to virtue and to all doctrine
Slough his wif called Erudice
Let his spouse took a concubyne
Wasted his life began him silf enclyne
To all riot surfeit and outrage
And in this wise he spent his young age
Thus was disclaundryd his royal mageste
In lecherous lustys watchid all night
Abed till noone ageyn all honest
Of falls excess shope him anon right
When he aros to drink again might
Gorge upon gorge to afforce his lecherye
The long day he spente in glotonye
I wexe weary the process for to write
Of this tyrant vicious and wode
It is contagious the process to endyte
Because the exaumple does harm and no good
And of vengeance thus with him it stood
Of sodeyne myscheef I read he did fine
Embraced in arms of his concubyne
Agathodia plainly was her name
And had a son called agathodes
Vicious both and sclaundryd by diffame
Noysed by report they were so recheles
Both at onys take in a sodeyn pres
With their allies all atonys fet
And by Just dome led to the gybet
How Abithomarus and Viridomarus Dukys of france after great bataylss by
romans slain
Next Philopater called tholome
There came in order a worthy duke of france
Nabytomarus and out of that cuntre
Rode into Greece with a great puissaunce
And first he began to make his ordenaunce
Again romans albe they were far
Proudly with them for to gynne a werre
But they of rome to their confusion
By their busshoppes and preestys began deuyse
To use a cursyd falls supersticion
Unto their goddys in full cruel wise
To offer up men by a new sacrifise
To bury them quik in bochas thus I read
By a falls hope they better for to speed
Of france and greece they took ten in noumbre
Half men and wymen to gedre tweyne and tweyne
And by falls murdre they did them encoumbre
Buried them quyk their death was full sodeyne
At this sacrefyse the goddys began disdeyn
And to the ramayns wex contraryous
For their falls rightys supersticious
And by record of old croniculeers
The year five hundre fro their fundacion
And one and twenty tho being consulers
Three in noumbre as made is mention
Which governed and ruled all the town
The first called Lucius Emilius
And the second catulus gaius
Actilius regulus the third consulere
By all the Senate ordained were these three
As I have told the selue same year
For to govern and rule the Cite
And to preserve them from all aduersite
Ageyn two peples of gaul and lumberdye
Which than werred of malice and envy
Of which werre the romans stood in boute
The senators and all the citeseyns
Because against them there came so great a route
Of lumbardys by this half the mounteyns
Joined togedre with many fell foreyns
Which stood departed as made is remembrance
Fro them of rome and their obeysaunce
The people rude bestyall and unstable
Togedre assemblyd wode and furious
Of multitude very innumerable
Vengeable of heart of courage despytous
Void of all reason suddenly furious
As seyth bochas I can no ferther gone
Their soudiours bare gisarmys euerychon
And gysarmes of gisarmes they were called
Toward rome them hastinge day by day
Of great labor the fotemen sore app^llyd
But ay their trust on multitude lay
Of whoos coming rome stood in afray
And specially the consuleers three
That out were sent to fight for the cite
Four score thousand as write the croniclere
Mighty to stand at diffence
In his felawship had each consulere
And of the gisarmes noumbre in sentence
Three hundred thousand by sturdy violence
Going on foot I find that they had
Eight thousand over that all the feeld spread
I rekne not them that rode on horsbak
Which six and thretty thousand were in noumbre
Six hundryd over purposed for the wrak
Finally the romans to encoumbre
The shadow of them gave so great an vmbre
That on the soil which tofore was grene
There was enneth any son shene
Their capteyne was Abitomarus
A manly man and a full worthy knight
And with them went viridomarus
Another capteyne in steel armyd bright
Twene them and romans long last the fight
But on the party of rome the cite
Was slain a consul one of the three
After whoos death of fortune anon right
On the party of them of rome town
Eight hundred thousand took them to the flight
And thus began the fame and the renoun
Of abithomarus as made is mention
Of which victory his heart was made feign
And on his party were three thousand slain
But the romans resorted be again
And after that had a strong batale
And in the feeld so manly they were seyne
And so proudly their enmyes did assail
That as mine auctour makes rehersayle
Of the Gysarmys long or it were night
Forty thausand were slain in that fight
The thrydde time with help of them of france
Joined to lumbardes and folk of gaul also
They faught again all out of ordenaunce
Beside the ryuere that called is the Poo
Where both batayles togydre had adoo
And as I find consulers tweyne
To romayn sheltrouns knightly did ordeyne
Maulius Torquat called was that one
Flamynus Flakkus was with him Ifere
And with the romans forth to gydre they gone
Toward that ryuere with a full manly chere
In which bataile the story does us lere
Nine and forty thousand slain on that day
Of their enmyes that none ne went away
Abythomarus was takyn prysonere
In tokne of tryumphe brought to rome town
To the capitoyle with a full pale chere
Led bound in chenys there gained no raunson
Thus has fortune appallyd his hye renoun
And in tokne of his disconfiture
Offered to goddys was his cote armure
Thus lachesis his lives threde began draw
Till Antropos it brak with full great pain
Viridomarus that was his felawe
Slain in the field by romans in certain
And of these worthy princes tweyne
This was the end and the mortal fall
The feast accomplisshid called funeral
And in the time of these mortal werres
Atwene these dukes and them of rome town
Many toknes were showed in the sterres
Meruaylous lightnynges fro the heaven down
And many an uncouth constellacion
Sundry Cometes did in the walkinge appear
Who seth their stories may the troth lere
The water pytene that renneth in Itayle
Which in that cuntre is a famous flode
The same hour and time of their battle
As seith the story was turned in to blood
Fyres in the heir most furious and wode
That mighty toures were with the flamys brent
Three monys apperinge in the Orient
The people for fere fled in to low caves
For dread wex pale and dedly of their chere
And in three days were three earth quauys
Duringe this weres and in the same year
Of great appollo fill down the pyllere
Of marbyll white large and of great strength
That sixty Cubits accoumted was the lengethe
And in that time the story says not nay
Of rome a consul with a great puissaunce
Called claudius slough upon a day
Thretty thousand and brought to mischaunce
Of the soudiours that came out of france
And there was slain with many a captayn lorne
Virydomarus of whom I spak toforne
To his great shame and confusion
As it is remembryd by scripture
The romans made a great oblacion
Up to Jupiter of his cote armure
And in tokne of his disconfiture
Within that temple of gold betyn clear
To his despyte they henge up his banere
How Siphax of Munedye king was take and dyed in prison
HEre bochas breuely for a remembrance
Writes werres debates and batayles
That were that time in Itayle and france
In spain chau^payne with marciall apparayles
And among other in his rehersayles
He tells in affrik the great dissencion
Atwene hanyball and worthy Scipion
He touches their names and abides not long
Upon their stories he bide not but awhile
Here not rehersinge their mighty werrys strong
Nor of their stryues he does not here compyle
But down dessendynge dyrecteth forth his style
For to reherce and tell by writynge
The fall of Siphax in Munedye king
This said Siphax batayles had tweyne
One with king Gabba he of very might
Had eke an other in which he did his pain
To mete masmissa after anon right
And both kings he put to the flight
And of Messulie I find by writing
How Masmissa was governor and king
This said siphax through his chiualrye
Made Masmyssa to fle his region
Constreynyd him to live by robbrye
To walk in forestys with bestys up and down
And for diffaute as made is mention
To save his life he fond no better refute
But fed him silf on rotys and on fruit
Out of his realm masmyssa was enchasyd
And constreyned to fle fro his cuntre
Fro mind of folk his name was out raced
For no man wyste where he should be
His liege men and folk of his cite
Through all affryk knew no better read
Of his person but dempt that he was deed
Thus of king Siphax encrece began the glory
Which by force two kings has outrayed
And upon them won the victory
Put them to flight and the people affrayed
That rome and cartage were of him dismayed
And each of them did their labor
Of their werrys to make him gouernoure
Unto Siphax out of rome town
As it is wretyn for a memorial
To Numedye was sent scipion
For this matter in especial
Out of cartage was sent hastruball
And at the castle where Siphax lay
Both tweyne arrived at one day
And by pleyne writing as I have conceived
And as the story remembers in sentence
At their cu^mynge both were received
Of king Shyhax with great reverence
And through his notable manly diligence
As it is wretyn by good record
He made these capteyns hertely of acorde
That they to gedre lay the same night
They had of Syphax so great suerte
By promise made as he was true knight
That nouther of them should deceyuyd be
But there was found great duplycyte
Following after who so can take heed
Like as this storye shall deuyse in deed
For by the fraud and falsnes most mortal
Compassed beforn it is thus befall
That by the sleight of this hastruball
As affricans be nigh double all
Under sugar can hide well their gall
So hastruball by falls decepcion
Under fair chere desceyued Scipion
He brought in siphax by falls subtylte
And by his sleyght peyntyd fair langage
That he should with him allied be
By full assente to have in marriage
Sophanisba a maydyn of cartage
Which was daughter young and fair withal
As seyth bochas to this hastruball
The which thing by craft was brought about
And accomplisshed verily in deed
And by this mean pleynly out of doubt
There first began rancoure and hatrede
Symulacion feynyd and falshede
That atwene siphax and hastruball alas
Scipion was diceyued in this cas
And after that done was this marriage
Syphax full enmye to this Scipion
With hastruball rode in to cartage
And began werraye again rome town
And in this while as made is mention
King masmyssa out of wilderness
Toward Scipion in all haste began him dress
With his people began to make him strong
Through help of scipion and of bellius
Went again syphax and abode not long
His heart again him was so enuyous
And on a day the story tells thus
With affricans and folkys of Cartage
Siphax the romans met in the visage
Of masmyssa the people were so wode
Upon Siphax auengyd for to be
Through their batayles came to him there he stood
And maugre him and his cruelte
Of very manhood space was none to fle
They brought him home through their hye renoun
In to the hondys of worthy Scipion
Siphax was take thus or he was ware
Under his baner maugre all his might
And into rome led before the chare
Of scipion the noble worthy knight
That wan the triumph granted him of right
And Siphonisba before to Sophax wif
Wed to masmysse at the end of all this strif
Loo how fortune change can her tides
To one this day she can be favorable
Make capteyns and these great guydes
Which wend have found her whele stable
But that she is ay froward and chaungeable
Friendly to day tomorowe at discord
If this be true Siphax can bear record
This Shiphax was sent out of the town
In cheynes bound without more taryinge
And at tyburny lay fetred in prison
Dyed at mischeef made there his ending
And for because that he was a king
The romans made of marciall pity
Him to be buried within their cite
How Nabyn having no title but by tyranny took on him to be king of
macedoyne was slain
nExt came Nabyn full pytously weeping
Tofore John bochas which by tyranny
Of macedoyne took on him to be king
Having no title save title of robbrye
Only by force him silf to magnefye
Which with strong hand took full possession
For to be crownyd in thilke region
This macedoyne as by old writings
Whilom was had in full great reverence
Because only it floured in two things
Both in knighthode and souereyne sapience
Mars there by manhood Pallas by prudence
And while these tweyne had governance
Of all welfare they had suffisaunce
And while noblesse of these things tweyne
That is to sey the flower of hye clergy
The hye renoun most famous and souereyne
Of marciall prowess and of chiualrye
Governed that land by new policy
Than stood that kingdom auctours reherce ko^ne
Among the grekys like an heavenly son
But at the last eclipsed was the light
Both of knighthode and philosophye
When couetise began enter again right
For to usurp upon the regalye
But intrusion of falls tyranny
And by extort force made their entringes
Having no title there to regne as kings
This was cheef cause for short conclusion
That the noblesse of greece was brought baas
And macedoyne brought to confusion
By couetise that set them in such caas
Thereby their knighthode fully translated was
And their policye in chronicles ye may se
Out of greece to rome the cite
And among other by clear remembrance
Of such tyrauntys by order rehersinge
Nabyn was one that had governance
In macedoyne and was there crounyd king
Without title there falsely regnynge
And for his froward contagious cruelte
He was behatyd of rome the cite
The romans sent a mighty consulere
Titus flamynius of their werres guide
To Macedoyne he began to approach nere
Toward argos where Nabyn did abide
Of entente for to abate his pride
But while Nabyn stood highest in estate
Of greece his lieges with him were at debate
A Duke I called Pilopomones
With the people that dwelled in greece land
To strive with nabyn put him silf in pres
Disconfited him fightinge hand of hand
And at great mischeef ye shall understand
Alexamenes a knight of that cuntre
Slough this nabyn the cronicle ye may se
Here Bochas reherceth the mortal werrys between Romans and Affricans
AFter this Nabyn bochas does proceed
To tell the warrys and the mortal stryues
Twene romans and affricans in deed
Whereby full many lost there their lives
Caused wedowes maydyns and eke wives
To weep and weyle in such disioynt they stood
On outher party to se the loss of blood
For the party of them of rome town
Were made capteyns and diverse officeers
Which into affrik with people were sent down
And specially there were two consuleers
Notable in armies and famous in tho years
Marcus maulius borne of the romayn line
That other called Lucius censoryne
With them was sent a tribune full notable
Of whom tofore I made mention
For the werres most worthy and most able
I mean of rome proud Scipion
Which of their cite was cheuest champion
Of intent the affricans tanoye
And specially Cartage to destroy
And nigh by cartage there was a cite strong
Mightily bilded and stood upon the se
The wallys thick round square and long
Cheef diffence called of that cuntre
To save and keep them from aduersite
And forty cubits with creestys marciall
Like as I find of hight was the wall
And the front raised for the werre
Of stonys square was an hye dungeon
Called birsa fro which wonder far
Men might behold the cuntrees enuiron
And as I read for their salvation
The affricans of purpos did ordeyne
For their capteynes hastruballys tweyne
The said dungeon mightily batayled
Ageyn call sautys to stand and endure
But worthy scipion for all that has not failed
For to approach and do by besy cure
With his engynes mighty strong and sure
So that by force this knight most marciall
A great quantite brake down of the wall
And Lucius called Sensoryne
Depertyd is with marchus maulius
And by the counsel of scipion and doctrine
Both of assente in armies virtuous
They took their wey mine auctour tells thus
With hastruball sothely and they might
Where as he lay that same day to fight
These consulers assailed the cite
Called ci^ie and beat down the wall
Slough forty thousand the cronycle ye may se
Of affricanys by vengeance full mortal
And their cunstable called Hastruball
Was slain that day by him it is no doubt
That he most trustyd and next were him about
And this while most manly of courage
The worthy trybune Publius Scipion
By verrey force is entered in cartage
And six days as made is mention
He and his knights constreyned so the town
That despeyryd with their dedely cherys
They of the town yielded them prisoneris
Mekely requeringe unto Scipion
To receive him in this mortal rage
That men and wymen dwelling in that town
With the citesyns young and old of age
Might abide and live in seruage
Under the romans there was no better refute
And year by year pay them a tribute
And of affryk that other hastruball
Which among them before was crowned king
Left his estate and his powere royal
Yeldyd him prisonere humbly knelyng
And his wif most pitously weeping
When that she saw her lord take so
Ran in to fire and burnt her silf for woe
Six and twenty thousand as I find
Were led of wymen into captyuyte
Thretty thousand of men came byhynde
Take prisoners in great aduersite
And seuentene days brent that cite
That in their wallys was none so hard stone
But in to poudre it was burnt anon
And this was done breuely to conclude
By the prowess of Publius Scipion
Sold in seruage was a great multitude
Their old lords led fetred to prison
This was of cartage fynall destruction
To write their complayntes bochas abides no while
But in to greece turns ageyn his style
How king perseus by romans outrayed and after take.
IN Lacedomoyne remembringe on a king
Called perseus a full proud werroure
Claymynge a title upon him usurping
For to succeed as true enheritoure
To great alisaundre most mighty conqueroure
Fully affermynge ageyn a certain day
He will be crowned maugre who seyth nay
And his name to put in memory
Cast in his person to renew the prowess
Of king alysaundre and to encrece his glory
To follow his traces in knighthode and nobles
And first of all of hasty wilfulness
That his conquest might sprede far
Began of purpose with romans to have ^ werre
But after this he was better auysed
When he perceived the marcyall apparyle
Of the romans whereof he was agrysed
Wex aferde their nobles to assail
Which ay were found victorious in battle
And where before he had been recheles
Sent ambassatours with them to trete of pes
They had perceived his presumpcion
And how he was proud and surquedous
Sent a Consul with a great power down
The name of whom was Sulpicius
Which dedly hatyd the said perseus
Through hertly rancour ageyn him wex soleyne
Of his ambasset having but dysdeyne
And their pertye for to fortefye
With the said Consul Sulpicius
They sent another expert in chiualrye
A consul also paulus Emylius
Among romans notable and famous
And following after the silf same night
The moon eclipsed fully of his might
A clear tokne as made is mention
That king perseus should have a sharp shoure
And that his lordship and his region
Should be oppressed void of all socour
And that Macedonoys should have no favor
Again the romans to gedre when they met
With round sperys and swerdes sharp whet
The day of battle to his encres of glory
For the perty of them of rome town
There was a knight that caused the victory
Young fressh and lusty that called was caton
Which brought their enmyes to confusion
For Macedonoys through his great might
Outrayed were and percius put to flight
But Emylius the noble Consulere
Sent a Capteyne called Octauius
To pursue after in coostys far and nere
The proud king the seyde perseus
And he was take for there was no rescus
With his sons that were in nounbre tweyne
Philip and alisaundre the story is certain
My^ auctour tells here of kings many
Thre^y in noumbre the first Geramus
Which have reigned within macedone
And last of all was this perseus
The noumbre of years bochas writes thus
Was nine hundred as I remembered here
Space of their regnynge with four and twenty year
After translated was the region
With all their yles unto the obeysaunce
Of them of rome without excepcion
To great lordys that were of most puissaunce
Abode there long under governance
Of perseus disconsolat of chere
During his lif abode there prysonere
How the people af Achaia with their cheef cite Corinthe by romans was
destroyed
THus the lordship weryd out and spent
Of Macedoyne as made is mention
The two cuntrees thereto adjacent
That one Achaia a little region
And spatanoys going enuyron
Mighty of people and of great substance
In one confederat and of one alliance
They were conjoined and both made al one
By a manner feithfull conuencion
And when the romans knew them for their fone
Having their frenship in suspeccion
They cast to make a disjunction
Between these lands in bread and eke in length
For thing disseueryd is menused of his strength
Ordained cytes and towns here and yonder
Whereon the romans began make a decre
That their lordshippes should be set assonder
Which made the people in every great Cite
When they knew their subtilte
To rise at onys most cruel of their cheris
And would have slain the romayn messa^gerys
And finally by this occasion
Romans ageyn them began wexe furious
Took herdynes of their diuysion
And a consul called Mumus
A manly knight in armies full famous
Into Achaya was from rome sent
It to destroy by great auisement
They of Achaia by their negligence
And by their froward wylfull rechelesnesse
Of very pride list make no diffence
Thought them silf without auysenesse
Of power able and strenger in sothnesse
Than were romans verily in deed
Thus were they stroyed before or they took head
They stood in hope in their sturdynesse
By that battle to have had great pillage
Of the romans to have won full great richesse
And for a pomp of wylfull falls dotage
They took their wives and wymen young of age
And set them upon an hye mounteyne
That their manhood might in the feelde be seyne
When the romans met them in battle
They dispurueyed and out of ordinance
Slain like bestys their power began to fail
Of froward pride and recheles governance
that achaia was brought to myschaunce
Wymen and children for sorrow almost mad
To live in seruage were to rome lad
Corinthe that time was their cheef cite
Destroyed by romans and brought to ruin
Which among Cytees in Bochas ye may see
Above all other did in honor shine
Of all sciences there floured the doctrine
And of crafts artifycers most wise
Rekne all the world there was cheef marchaundyse
Thus unwarily in their most noblesse
Sittynge of fortune in the stage
They were destroyed of tresoure and richesse
Brought to naught by slaughter and pyllage
Their walls broke in that cruel rage
And in that brennynge bochas seith the leuene
Raught a great part upward to the heuene
Pleyne with the earth the wallys broke down
The people slain merciles young and old
And there was made a great dyuision
Su^me led in seruage and su^me of them were sold
Imagys of copir of silver and of gold
Were suddenly in all that violence
Togydre molte so hot^ was the feruence
Of which metal thus after it is fall
Gold silver copir medlyd into one
Copre of corynthe men did it call
Through all the world of custom euerichone
Fame of which metal is so far gone
That the vessels forgyd of the same
Corinthoise called is the name
AFter Corynth was thus brent to naught
A prince called Philip Philermene
To John bochas has his co^pleynt brought
In whoos face and chere it was well seen
The woeful constreynt of his mortal tene
And he was whilom bochas does specefie
Lord of a cite called vallaquie
Marchu^ actilius took him prisonere
Brought him to rome list him not respyte
Next to Bochas with an heavy chere
Apperyd a knight called domocrite
Of Etholis mine auctour does so write
He was cheef lord but he and his cuntre
Translatyd were into rome the cite
This duke was cast and cheyned in prison
Escapyd onys in story as I find
Take again throw in a derke dungeon
There for sorrow went out of his mind
Slough him silf at mischeef again kind
Loo how these princis proud and recheles
Have shameful end which can not live in pes
How great antiochus vsinge riot and vicious living by Marchus actilius was
outrayed and dyed suddenly
tOuching the storye murdre here following
Of Selenchus and great antiochus
Of his mother Leodices and the king
With other toknes and signs merueylous
And how also the same selenchus
Had in his thigh as wretin is toforne
Prynt of an ankyr the day when he was borne
And all the children by succession
Had by descent borne of his lynage
Prynte of an ankyr as made is mention
The fourth book with all the surplusage
Of other toknes there told plain langage
And of the seyde fame Selenchus
Came by discente the said antiochus
Whoos heart was set of hye couetyse
To follow his lustys and dilectacion
And specially he cast began and devise
To win in greece diverse regions
And of the people he caught occasions
By their favor to conquer their cuntre
And rebbell again rome the cite
With multitude and great apparayle
He gate in greece castelles and eke touns
Longing to rome conqueryd by battle
Took upon him in his presumpcions
Falsely to follow the inclinacions
Of his birth while he did abide
In a cite that called was Talcide
For cause of sloth he left his chiualrye
Forsook mars and took him to capide
Resting the winter he spent in lecherye
In wetch and riot chase venus to his guide
Sensualite made reason stand aside
And by these menys for short conclusion
He was conveyed to his destruction
And when that winter with his frostys cold
Passyd was and all his storms kene
In riot spent and wastyd as I told
And veer came in with his new grene
And fressh flora which is of flowers queen
Of custom gynneth her motles out dress
In which ceson as auctours all express
Kings princis with marciall apparayle
Time when phoebus in the ram does shine
They them dispose to go out to battle
For exercise of marcyall disciplyne
And down from rome expert in that doctrine
Descended is marchus actilius
Again this vicious proud antiochus
This noble mark preuyd in armies well
Which in his time was so good a knight
With all his oste armed in bright stele
Ageyn antiochus came to the feeld down right
Upon a morrow when phoebus shone full bright
Set his wardeyns by capteyns that he ches
Upon a hill called termophiles
Antiochus upon that other side
Whom glotonye and riot did oppress
And drunken bachus which with him did abide
With morpheus wife of slombyr cheef gods
Which caused him through sloth and Idelnesse
That providence out of his court was gone
Causynge that day the slaughter of many one
When the Consul marchus the worthy
His adversaries proudly began assail
They vnpuruayed took them to the flight
Disareyed they might not avail
Thus antiochus fled out of battle
For again romans he might not endur
Therefore on him fill the disconfiture
Thus rebukyd fled to Ephesie
Far in Greece and there to dwell he ches
Sent to romans a great ambassatrye
With the seyde marchus for to trete of pe^
But in this ambasset this very doutles
When they atteyned of Marchus the presence
Were refused and had none audience
Of which antiochus greatly was ashamyd
Cast again rome of hate and enmyte
To reyse a power and has of new attamyd
To gadre ships and make a great arm
Gynne a werre ageyn them on the sea
Having an hope under a cowarde dread
Better on the water than on the land to speed
Made his ships be stuffed with vitayle
And his capteynes has the land forsake
But when the romans of new began him assail
His ships brent and all his stuf was take
And like mine auctour compendyously does make
These on the se the romans werraynge
He was outrayed the story witnessinge
Yet eft again to his confusion
Upon the land he began make him strong
Met with cornelie called scipion
With waynes carts made for the werre stornge
Shod with hard iron sharp sithes set among
In trauers wise by great ordenaunce
But for all that he was brought to mischaunce
With Olifauntys and castles on the bak
That day was slain many a wo^thy knight
Upon his oste so cruel was the w^ak
That he constreyned took him to the flight
Forsook the cuntre fled out of mennys sight
To the romans he could it not delay
Each year constreyned a tribute for to pay
But he of fraud because of his tribute
For couetise feyned sore pouerte
Gadred robbours and by falls pursuit
Oppressed merchants spoiled the cuntre
Robbed temples of hateful cruelte
And fro Jupiter called dodauian
Took all the relykes the story tell can
Did sacrilege and entryd in that clos
Without reverence or any obseruaunce
For which the tempyl ageyn him roos
And as it is put in remembrance
By the goddys there fill a great vengeance
Upon this tyrant quakinge in his dread
All suddenly he fill to ground deed
Lenuoye
tHis tragedye of Antiochus
Who list in order his froward story se
First to all virtue he was contrarious
And rebel ever to rome the cite
Justly accused of vicious things three
Of pride sloth and of glotonye
And of disordynat superfluite
Of night excess riot and lechery
On him the romans were victorious
Twyes on the land onys on the se
He was not hardy but malicious
In every battle his custom was to fle
There vices regne there may no grace be
To all surfetys his lust he did apply
Noysed and disclaundred throughout his cuntre
Of night excess riot and lechery
Among his lyegis wode and despitous
And for a cowarde know in the feelde was he
The pore to oppress a wulfe most furious
And by disceit a fox for subtylite
Noman more froward of hye not low degree
Nor more delitinge in falshede nor flaterye
What was his end a sodeyne death parde
For his outrages of pride and lecherye
Noble princis of prudence full famous
In all your grettest royal mageste
Remember pleynly if ye be virtuous
Ye shall prseuere in long prosperyte
Where the contrary causes aduersite
As this storye before does specefye
Of antiochus cast from his dignite
For his great pride riot and lechery
How Ieronimus king of Ciracuse was slain / ^ how Scipio affrican that
labored for common well of romans was exiled by them and so dyed
AFter the death of this antiochus
There came a prince to bochas compleynyng
Which that was called Ieronimus
Of Cyracuse whilom lord and king
Which of his liegis he nothing trespassynge
Slain was with his three susters dear
Of hatrede mine auctour writes here
Cyracusanis had a condition
Through chaunges new ay to be unstable
Of wilful malice void of all reason
On their kings for to be vengeable
They louyd not to have them perdurable
But every year of custom this is true
Them to govern to have a prince new
And for their chaunges and their uncouth stryues
With variaunce of their conditions
Because no fruit is found in their lives
Nor in their stories nor in their successions
I will pass over and speak of Scipions
And first to write of the worthy man
Called in his time scipio affrican
A famous knight in all nations
For his conquest shortly to conclude
Which had brought full many regions
More by wysdom than by multitude
To obey the romans but for ingratitude
Which that he fond in them as I read
How he wrought to tell I will proceed
It is remembered of his worthynesse
While that he was flouring in young age
How rome was made lady and maistresse
Of many a land to their advantage
And specialy all affrike and Cartage
By his prowess as made is mention
Were brought of romans under subjection
But they agen^warde were to him unkind
By accusacions found out by their falsnesse
Seyde again him as it is put in mind
By record of many falls witnessis
That he should have besiled the richessis
Of Cartage and affryk the cuntre
Which apperteyned to rome the cite
But ageynwarde this noble affrican
Proudly gave answer to his accusours
He never withhelde fro time that he began
Toward him silf noport of their tresours
Save as the manner is of conquerours
For to conserve his worship and his name
Almost was profit to the touns fame
This is to mean plainly and not tarry
He never accrochyd tresour nere nor far
Toward him silf but that was necessary
For their worship to mayntene with their werre
And yet that time he was their lodesterie
To encrece their boundys and fully his delight
Was all hole set to the common profit
He took none head of all the surplusage
Of their tresours nor their great richesse
The name reserved of affrik and cartage
To his knighthode and his hye noblesse
But their malicious expert unkindness
Was in cause breuely to compyle
His body fro them perpetually to exile
Cast him never within rome town
After that day among them to be seyne
Unkindness gave him occasion
To absente his person and of hye disdeyn
To exile him silf and never to cu^me ageyn
But for tabyde in a small village
Called Lynterne when he was fall in age
And for men should mind upon him have
By a manner of indignacion
An Epitaphre he set upon his grave
Which said thus to them of rome town
O people unkind unkind ageyn reason
My funeral ashes nor my bones deed
In thy wallys thou shall never possede
In thyn unkind froward teritorye
My bonys shall not rest nor abide
But thyn unkindness to put in memory
To remembrance shall be red full wide
Of these letters grave on every side
By report only of this small scripture
Which here is set upon my sepulture
Lo here the cause by breef descripcion
Set on my grave for a memorial
Why that my bonys out of rome town
Be buried here low under this wall
In exil hold my feast funeral
Unkindness me drove out of that cite
That wrought so much for the comonte
How Scipio Asian lord of Asye that labored ever for the common well was
murdered
AFter the end of this affrican
Called in his time worthy scipion
Came next his brother Scipio Asyan
Which in Asie had domynacion
Gayn whom was made an accusacion
To all the senate that untruly should
Certain tresours toward him silf witholde
Which that he in asie had won
In his conquest by many strong battle
Which accusacion falsely was begone
Of old envy causeles this no fail
Whoos worthynesse full much did avail
To common profit by these two conquerours
By great richesse encresinge their tresours
The tone in affrik as ye have herd me tell
By his wisdom and his chyualrye
That other in asia which did excelle
In hye prowess as books specefye
Falsely hindryd of hatrede and envy
By compassinge of one antiochus
Him to destroy he was so desirous
Not withstondynge these tweyne scipions
Had in their time by manyfolde batayles
Brought into rome so many ragions
To obey their cite with marciall apparayles
And evermore to their great auayles
Brought in tresours to encrere with their town
Yet have they wrought to their destruction
The tone in exile as made is mention
Dyed alas when that he was old
The second was murdryd in prison
Their both stories remembered here and told
To give exaumple to princys many fold
That who that labors for a comonte
Lesith often his thank by scipions ye may se
How the duke philopomones was take put in prison after drank poison and so
dyed.
AFter the process of these two scipions
Twene two peoples wilful and recheles
Began in greece new dissencions
Twene Acheois and Etholois doutles
And a great duke Philopomones
A prince that time of full great puissaunce
Had of Messoneis holy the governance
This said prince philopomones
L^dynge his oost upon afull fair pleyne
As he rode armyd and put him silf in prees
Myd his people as gouernoure and wardeyne
Folk out of rule for to call again
Upon his stead as he began them fette
In due order his wards for to set
And these princys of port most marciall
In the pursuit which that he began make
Among his enmyes he had a sodeyn fall
Void of all rescus unwarily he was take
Of all his frendys like a man forsake
Among his enmyes brought into prison
There made an end by drinking of poison
Of philopomones this was the fatal cas
Out of governance his people disolate
Except a capteyn called ligorias
Which in the werres was wondre fortunat
Of acheoys took on him thestate
Them to govern and the people led
Of him no more in bochas I do read
Of the thread Scipion Nasica that ever wrought much for the comonte.
mine auctour here makes a digression
And reherceth for a memoryall
Of the thread worthy scipion
Called nasica which in especial
By disposicion very natural
Hold among romans by report of langage
Passing all other in wysdom and courage
Old of discrecion and not but young of yerys
For a miracle mine auctour does express
When senatour^ sent messangerys
In to frigia by great auysnesse
For Berosynthya most famous goddess
When she was brought by them that did her guide
In house nor temple she would not abide
Save in the paleys of this scipion
To put his name more in remembrance
The which also thorugh his hye renoun
Gallobois he brought to vttraunce
A people of greece far out of governance
But Scipion began them so werrey
Maugre their malice the romans for tobeye
Whereby his name was put in memory
And full great thank he has in rome deserved
Because only of his great victory
For which the triumph was to him reseruyd
But at last full falsely he was served
Of the romans after their old manner
In this tragedye anon as ye shall here
After he had augmented their tresours
Conqueryd in asie many regions
Caused of their fone that they were victours
Appesed of Graccus the false accasions
Compassed of malice by new discencion
Atwene the people and also the senate
He of hye wisdom has stint all that debate
Trusting the romans scipion was begyled
Lost their favor and offendyd naught
By them unwarily banysshed and exyled
Clean forgotyn put out of their thought
For common profit all that he has wrought
The guyrdon lost though princys can not se
Of all that done for any comonte
Like a blase for a while light
Which shewith clear and is never after seyne
Or like a son for a maument bright
Unwarily shrouded with a shroude of reyn
Right so the wyndy favor blows in vein
May resemble for a mutabilite
Of them that do for any comonte
The people follows their own opinions
In their conceitis they be so wondirfull
Will hold the brydel of their discrecions
Their hasty demynge so bestiall is and dull
Of blind bayarde they brayde at a pull
To quite the guerdou^s of marcyall bountye
Of them that done for any comonte
This day a prince stand in the peplis grace
Like as they would his name deifye
Above the sterrys in Jupiters place
With mars and phoebus his name to stellefie
But by to morrow there comes a soden sky
Showing there is a full feynt surete
Of them that do for any comonte
And for tafferme that is truly so
Call three Scipions to remembrance
First of affryk and asie both two
Note in cronicles their knightly governance
Their restles labors romans for tauaunce
Rekne ageynwarde how these princis three
Were full ungoodly quit by the comonte
Lenuoye
THis tragedye of three Scipions
So worthy in knighthode and eke notable
Made so many famous regions
Subiet to rome this story is no fable
Where the the romans double and deceyuable
Showed ageynwarde to these princis three
The thank lost and guyrdon couenable
Of him that does for any comonte
Rekne up in aff^ik the cytees and the tou^s
Great Car^^ge with castles defensable
Rekne in as^^ the great possessions
With reuenuys very Innumerable
Rekne their triumphs af pris incomparable
Which considred ye may a myrrour see
How the guyrdouns befalls and flaskysable
Of them that do for any comonte
They were whilom the romayn champions
Of senators to set the honor stable
To avoid discord and all discencions
Atwene the commons and statys honorable
But she that is of custum ay chaungeable
Fortune in whom may be no surete
Shows in her whele the guyrdons mutable
Of them that done for any comonte
Noble princis peyse in your resons
All wordly thing in earth is transmutable
Feynt and unsure your domynacions
Charity is there none to make them perdurable
Sorrow at departing your bodies corumpable
A thing rassemblynge that never had be
Record on Scipions by guerdons rassemblable
Of them that done for any comonte
Trust never in your opynions
But that your power is each day remeuable
Be not made blind in your discrecions
But considre by exaumples reasonable
They of fortune like hasarde retournable
With sodeyne change of falls felicite
Unto the guerdons daily comparable
Of them that done for any comonte
How duke Hanyball after many victorious dedys murdered him silf with poison.
NExt to Bochas as I read
Out of affryk and cartage therwithall
There came a duke that had most hatrede
Ageyn the romans in especial
This famous prince called hanyball
By whoos prowess as it is well know
The said romans were daunted and brought low
And among other worthy dukys all
As old cronicles makes mention
Of hanyball the fate is so befall
At his birth by disposicion
That of his natural constellacion
Set in the heuene that he should be
Perpetually enmye to rome the cite
As the story of him does devise
While his fader duke whilom of cartage
Called amulchar did onys sacrifice
To his goddys and he nine year of age
Swore and auowed of heart and of courage
Duringe his lif without excepcion
Ever to be enmye unto rome town
This martis child this lusty young knight
Was to cartage the strong mighty wall
Which succedyd in his faders right
After the death of worthy hastruball
First he made a werre full mortal
Geyn Saguntynois as it is specefyed
Cause with romans that they were alyed
A dreme he had and was thus in sentence
That he should conquer in battle
Maugre all tho that stand at diffence
Two mighty cuntres first spain and than Itayle
Down descendynge with great apparayle
Passinge the famous ryuere Iberyus
And where he rode away victorious
With him of affryk many cheueteyns
Rode through Gaul fond no resistance
Of Pyrenes by the hye mounteyns
To show the rigor of his magnyficence
Over the alpies by sturdy violence
Natwithstandynge the passage was full wykke
Of slidinge frostys and of snowys thykke
A great party of his people lost
By the constreynt of that fell passage
Horse Olifauntys that many besaunt cost
Fond great^ daungere of them in his carriage
As^aut of brygauntes when they fond advantage
And as bochas put in remembrance
Felt great loss of all his ordenaunce
The alpyes passed with travail and great woo
This hanyball with all his chiualrye
Aprochyd is the ryuere of the poo
Came to a town that called is Cursye
Which stands upon the cite of pauye
Where a consul called scipion
Gave him battle even before the town
The same consul Gueus Scipion
Which by process of manly hanyball
Was desconfyted as made is mention
Tofore pauye had a right foul fall
The first victory in especial
That he had beyond the mountayns
When he pursued tasseyle the romans
Sempronyus a another consulere
That was felawe to said Scipion
Sent eke fro rome with a full proud chere
Geyn hanyball but in his cu^mynge down
Tofore Tresbye a large mighty town
Outrayed was by fatal adventure
And after never his fall might recure
Of two consulers this was the woeful fine
Sempronyus and Gueus Scipion
Over the mounteyne called Appenyne
Went hanyball through his great renoun
To great damage and great confusion
Of his people that passyd the mounteyns
Destroyed with cold snow and hidous reyns
Lost his knightys his tresours and his godys
There might as tho be made no diffence
His great stedys drownyd in the flodys
By the waters mighty violence
Fond for the time no better resistance
Save he escaped fro that soden wrak
Of an Olifaunte he ridinge on the bak
So Importable was his grievous pain
Only borne up of marciall courage
Yet there he lost one of his iyen tweyne
Kept of knighthode one chere and one visage
Through Itayle held alwey his passage
Slough a consul called flamynyus
Thus in three batayles he was victorious
But in this while as says mine auctoure
Quintus fabius subtle and deceyuable
Which was in rome a famous dictatour
And he apperceyued by toknes full notable
No romayn capteyn was in tho days able
As it was showed by experience
Geyn hanyball to make resistance
Yet in his conceit he subtylly gyn search
To find aweye he did his besy pain
Day by day began fully thereon werche
Outher by fraud or su^me compassed treyne
To lie in wait and secretly ordeyne
Embusshmentis to his advantages
Of hanyball to stop the passages
But all his traynes served him of naught
For hanyball this worthy affrican
In his conquest so proudly has wrought
So like a prince and a knightly man
For thilke time that he werrys began
Ageyn the romans both on so and land
That they were feeble his power to withstonde
This quintus fabius kept him alwey clos
Lyinge awayte to fall on hanyball
And of assente eke to his purpos
There was one varo manly and wise withal
And these tweyne in especial
Within Poyle a large great cuntre
Faught with hanyball at Cannas the cite
As the story makes rehersayle
The romayn party of worthy werreours
Were forty thousand slain in battle
Emylyus paulus thretty senators
Twenty in noumbre that had been pretours
And three hundred capteyns of estate
Slain by hanyball in that mortal debate
And by the slaughter of Emilius
The noble consul Romans disespeired
And hanyball that day victorious
To his lodging is ageyn repeyred
His foon outrayed and mortally appeyred
Knew no refute again this manly knight
But at myscheef took them to the flight
The which day if that hanyball
Had them followed proudly to the town
By the counseyle of one marthaball
A manly knight a prince of hye renoun
He should have had full possession
That day of rome like to his intent
But I suppose fortune list not assent
In this process plainly as I read
This hanyball wex proud and right pompous
Of four victoryes dempt him silf in deed
Above all other to be most glorious
Of his courage most inly surquedous
But o alas a little sloth and pride
For lak of pursuit his conqueste set aside
Yet in his conquest of knightys that lay deed
Of consulers old and young of age
With senatour^ the process who list read
Slain in the field in that mortal rage
Duke hanyball sent unto cartage
Of clean gold by record of writings
Out of the field three busshell full of rings
After four victoryes here remembered
By and by the process who list se
In which many worthy were dismembered
Both of affryk and rome the cite
Abate began the great prosperity
Of hanyball by froward adventure
Set onys bak fortune hard to recure
After the flowers of his felycite
His noblesse drew to declinacion
To Capne he went a mighty strong cite
There to soiourne as made is mention
All the time of winter cold ceson
Where to his lust and bodily plesaunce
Of all vitayle fond great habundaunce
Which made his knights slow to the werre
For wine wymen and plente of vitayle
Full often since cause men to err
Make them feeble their enmyes tassaile
Gorges agroteied enbosed their entrayle
Desposeth men rather to rest and sleep
Than of their enmyes for to take keep
But when winter with his frostys cold
Was ouergone in thilke region
Hanyball began his purpose hold
To ley a siege unto rome loun
But so great raynes fill fro heuene down
So great tempeste upon every side
For the constreynt he might not abide
To fortefye the seyde hanyball
Again his enmyes where he had adoo
Sent lettres unto hastruball
In right great haste for to cu^me him to
But fortune her whele has turned so
That hastruball where he was loath or fayn
By Salynator venquesshed was and slain
Of which mischeef and disconfyture
Hanyball began dull in his courage
Compleyned sore of his mysauenture
Knew no refute ageyn this mortal rage
Herd eke say that affrik and cartage
Were of new to his confusion
Strongly werreyed by worthy Scipion
Siphax also of munedye king
Which ageyn romans began a werre make
Maugre his might and all his fell werkinge
Was by force of Scipion Itake
Wherthrugh his courage greatly began aslake
And how cartage cheef of that region
Besegyd was also by Scipion
Thus hanyball constreyned was of need
Home to repair for rescus of ^artage
And was also in bokys as I read
The same time fall far in age
And at myscheef and great disauauntage
Again Scipion full little might avail
By whom he was sconfyted in battle
Cartage constreyned of necessite
Them to submit unto rome town
And for their more hard aduersite
Gueus gernilius was fro rome sent down
Only of purpos for this conclusion
For to procure in especial
Fynall destructioy and death of hanyball
After all his marciall labors
His old felicite wex froward and unmeet
In holowe images put all his tresours
Took his passage in to the land of crete
And fortune contrary and vnswete
Made officers keep his richesse
In the temple of dy^^e the goddess
Su^what for trust and p^ell eke for dread
To find socour he went to the king
Of Bythenye to help him in his need
Called Prusias but of his coming
The sleighty romans had knowlegynge
To bethenye down their letters sent
If Hanyball escape echon ye shall repent
The lettres red the king the same day
Made his people bysiege the dongeon
Where duke hanyball of trust alone ^ay
All destitute when he knew this treson
^^scape his enmyes drank wylfully poison
Chase rather so other escape was noon
Than in the hondes to fall of his foon
Tofore his death seyde this orison
To all the goddys devoutly down knelinge
That they would of this false treson
Take vengeance of prusias the king
Which was cause by his false werkinge
Of the destruction and death fynall
Of this famous worthy hanyball
Lenuoye.
THis tragedye froward to write or read
Of this forseide manly hanyball
My pen quoke my heart I felt blede
For to behold the woeful pitous fall
Of him that was the diffensable wall
Of Cartage the mighty strong town
Which slough him silf by drinking of poison
It was to him he thought more manhede
To sle him silf by vengeance most mortal
Than his enmyes by constreynt should him led
In cheynes bound he to be thrall
So great despite he had of them atall
That liver he had than bide in their prison
To mordre him silf by drinking of poison
As me seems in this horrible deed
He rassembled the furies infernal
Of cruel pluta I trow he took his mede
Void of all reason bycam bestyall
At whoos terrible fest funeral
Goddess proserpyna came with manes down
The same time when he drank poison
Noble princes consydre and take heed
Leuynge the surplus his dedys marcyall
Knightly remember and have in heart hatrede
Of his enpoysonynge in especial
Abhomynable to god and man withal
That a prince so famous of renoun
Should murdre him silf by drinkinge of poison
How Prusias king of bethenye betrayed Hanyball and would have disheryted his
son and heir went abeggynge in strange londys.
Following in order there came to Bochas
Of Bethenye the great mighty king
Which in his time was called prusias
Greatly sclaundred and noysed of one thing
That he was falls and double in werkinge
Again the noblesse of his estate royal
Because that he betraisshed hanyball
This diffaute derkyd the brightness
Of his fame and his knightly renoun
And eclipsid his passyd old prowess
By report in many a region
Alas that ever the condition
Of doubleness by falsnesse or feynynge
Should be found and namely in a king
Of this prusias ferther to proceed
Which geyn hanyball wrought this treson
Asonne he had called Nichomede
Borne to be heir by just succession
But his fadre by falls collusion
Purposyd him for he was young of age
To put him out of his heritage
In this matere there grue up a great stryf
By prusias geyn this Nycomede
Cause that he by his soconde wife
Had ayonge son in bokys thus I read
Whom he purposed to prefer in deed
For which he cast by short conclusion
Of Nychomede the destruction
And fort acomplissh this froward falls matere
By full great deliberacion
King prusias began show heavy chere
Geyne nychomede sekinge accasion
To depryue him of possession
After this day by subtle falls werkynge
In bethenye he shall not regne as king
The people seeing this great iniquite
Wrought by the king geyne good conscience
Through all the land of hye and low degree
To nychomede al of one sentence
Gave their good will and their benyuolence
For every lord and every great baron
Stood hole with him through all the region
Thus by just title he was crouned king
Prusias for shame and heaviness
In strange cuntrees lived by beggynge
All dissolate cried for alms
Loo here the end of treson and falsnesse
Left at myscheef mine auctour seyth the same
Of pouerte forsook his own name
Se here two things and take right god head
Of prusias the unware soden mischaunce
The disheritynge done to nychomede
After following on him the great vengeance
As the story put in remembrance
For treson done odyble and mortal
Again the forseyde famous hanyball
How Persa of macedoyne king that enpoysoned his brother was by Emylyus
outrayed and dyed in prison.
BEspreynt with terys pitously wepinge
As Bochas sat in his stody alone
Next came Persa of Macedoyne king
And mortally he began sigh and groan
And furiously for to make his moan
That he whilom was of so great renoun
Constreyned after to dye in prison
This seyde Persa of nature was froward
Evil disposyd eke of his condition
Though he of birth was but a basterde
He compassyd by falls collusion
After his fader to have possession
As mine auctoure remembers by writynge
Of macedoyn to be crouned king
His fader philip the story tells thus
Had a son which was young of age
Wys and ready called demetrius
Borne and begete truly in marriage
But Persa cast by furious outrage
Him to destroy and murdre by poison
He of that kingdom to have possession
Falsely compassyd to his advantage
In his intent demetrius to depryue
Of macedoyne which was his heritage
And thereupon he lettres began contryue
To preue him traitor while he was alive
Whereof king philip greatly was anoyed
That he and persa should be destroyed
By demetrius that thought no damage
Meant no harm in his opinion
Yet his fader suspecious of courage
And Persa gave him falls informacion
Made him be slain by drinking of poison
Upon a day a thing abhomynable
Sittinge at mete at his faders table
King philip after when he knew the troth
Had of his death great compassion
But all to late and that was great routh
Which caused after his own destruction
For sorrow dyed and of presumpcion
Persa after falsely usurping
In macedoyne was crownyd king
With diverse cuntrees made his alyaunce
In greece and trace gate frendys nere and far
And of pride and wylfull governance
Cast with romans for to hold werre
Vngrace and youth made him for to err
Till a consul sent fro rome town
Brought this persa unto destruction
Called Emelius was this consulere
Sent again Persa to have a great battle
Seeing his daughter heavy of her chere
When he went out his enmyes to assail
Made unto her this uncouth apposayle
Why weep ye so what thing does you agreue
At my departing taking of me leave
Fadre quod she and ye take heed
A whelpe I had that did great plesaunce
Cylled persa the which rightnowe is deed
And this cheef cause only of my greuaunce
Her fadre than began change countenance
This as tokne to mine encres of glory
That I of persa shall have the victory
(...) macedoyne he and persa met
And quyt him there like a manly knight
Conquer^th the land none might him wi^hset
And manly put persa to the flight
After to trace he took the way right
Of which conquest short process to make
With his two sons persa was there take
^milius after this victory
Ask^th the triumph to his guerdoun
And as it is remembered in his storye
Persa follows after his chare through rome town
Condemned after to dye in prison
The which death he did well deserve
For he by poison made his brother sterue
Thus can fortune erly and eke late
Down from her whele and hye stage
Of proud princes the surquedye abate
When to her lust she seth most advantage
She frowardly can turn her visage
And suddenly thestate of them consume
Above their office that wrongly list presume
Among which a king of Israel
Again the precept and law of moses
Called Ozias the bible can well tell
Of presumpcion wylfull and recheles
To sacrifise put him silf in pres
Like a bishop in the temple arrayed
But or he passyd greatly he was affrayed
Lost his spech smet with meselrye
During his life loo here a great vengeance
Of his crown and his regalye
Impotent to use the governance
Peril for pride and disobeysaunce
For list not mekely the law obey
For which at myscheef he did a lepre deye
How Amonyus a Prince of antyoch delytynge in pyllage and robbrye / with other
vicious living / fled in woman's clothinge / after takyn and slain.
NExt in order co^pleynynge his distress
Came Amonyus a notable werriour
To John bochas to show his heaviness
In antioche prince and governor
Of which cuntre while he was possessoure
Had a custum and this was his travail
To rob the rich and spoil the porayle
Spared nouther old nor young of age
Took fro marchauntys tresour and richesse
And in delytes of lecherous outrages
Was all his lust with watch and dronkenesse
Will in his court of reason was maistresse
Cgusinge the people through all the region
To rise again him by rebellyon
Contrary he was to all good disciplyne
The people arose ageyn him on a day
And he for fere in habyte femenyne
Like a wretch fled cowardly away
Take at myscheef there was made no delay
Falsely confessinge hirynge many a man
Ageyn nature that he was a woman
The troth know and the sclaundre ryf
All of assent the people antiochene
Rose atonys and so he lost his lif
They were so wode ageyn him in their tene
Thus of fortune the change is always seen
Fro better to wers she can so well transmue
Thestate of them that will no virtue sue
How Andriscus of low birth borne having no title of macedoyne king* was
take and dyed in prison
But of one thing fortune is to blame
That she is so chaungeable of courage
To set a boy unknow of birth and fame
By falls error upon a royal stage
For one Andriscus by surquedous outrage
Without title by subtle compassinge
Of macedoyne took on him to be king
Color was none his claim to make stable
Except that he of chere and of visage
Was to king philip of fetures most semblable
Whereby the people in their furious rage
Caught opinion of wylfull falls dotage
Again reason bochas does descryue
That king philip was resyn fro death to live
Whilom fadre of persa as I told
And for andriscus brought up in wretchydnesse
In presence both of young and old
Was bold to cleyme by title of rightwisnesse
Showing no ground but personell lyknesse
Mocking the people which by their favor
Of royal dignite receives the honor
Thus he that was fostred as a wretch
In myserye and eke in pouerte
Fro pore bed his hornys did up stretch
To hold a scepter of kingly dignite
And by the support of the comonte
And began wexe pompous and clate
Brought up of naught when he stood in estate
No thing more cruel nor nothing more vengeable
Nor more hasty to do execucion
Nor more deynous nor more vntretable
Than when a beggar has domynacion
A curre more froward than a strong lion
And semblably none so great cruelte
As when a wretch is set in dignite
This andriscus in his royal chaier
To execute his hateful cruelte
Gadred people in cuntrees far and nere
In macedoyne and of old enmyte
Began malign geyne rome the ci^e
But to withset his froward falls intent
One Inuencius a praetor was down sent
But by cause that he was necligent
And of despite took of him none head
He was outrayed and by andriscus shent
With all the people that he did led
But the romans of hope better to speed
Have sent Metellus a full manly knight
To macedoyne to mete anon right
This worthy man list not long to tarry
Set proudly on in hope it should avail
Made macedoyne to rome tributarye
Took and riscus manly in battle
Brought him to rome with mighty appareyle
And made him lie fettred in prison
For his outrageous falls presumpcion
Thus for his froward usurpation
That was haute in his prosperity
Knew not him silf by falls abusion
Blent with a mist of blind felicite
List not remember of his first pouerte
Whom to chastise fortune brought him low
Because he listnat him silf for to know
How alisaundre ballas king of surrie for extorcion pride and unkindness
dyed at mischeef.
THus can this lady pleye her pagent
By a manner of deynous mockerye
Her entermys forth serve them of intent
To folk that trust her only of folly
And to purpose whilom of surrie
There was a king like as write bochas
Called alisaundre whoos surname was ballas
Of which ballas to tell the process
First of his rysynge and after of his fall
Antiochus the story bears witness
Called Eupater which in especial
Cleymyd title to thestate royal
After his fadre named antiochus
Epiphanes the story tells thus
After whoos death the kingdom of surrie
Should long by succession
(...) E^pater and eke for his party
Demetrius hostage in rome town
Cleymed a title in that region
Of surrie by cause epiphanes
Was brought to him the story is no les
Demetrius fro rome is come down
In to surrie to claim his heritage
Received the croune took possession
Began we^ proud presumptuous of courage
Thus Eupater was but young of age
Excluded was in surrie to succeed
Of demetrius ferther thus I read
Outraious he was above mesure
Right veng^able and full of cruelte
Hateful also to every creature
And heavy borne of worthy kings three
First in egipte of worthy Tholome
And of actilius in asye tho regnynge
And ^^^arches in capedoce king
All of assente ageyn him have conspired
Fond awey demetrius to depryue
His undoing so sore they have desired
And their intent to execute bly^e
T^^y began a fable of purpose to contryue
As ye shall here togydre as they went
To which all Surre atonys did assent
They took a galaunt borne of low lynage
Called Ballas of their aqueyntaunce
And affermyd all of one courage
How he was son and just he^e in substance
To Epiphanes and next heir in alyaunce
To ^uc^ede by toknes aff^rmynge
(...) in Surrye to be crownyd king
Alisaundre of purpos they him call
Because they thought of person he was able
^et him up in his royal stall
Maugre Demetrius cruel and vengeable
And fortune was to them favorable
Made their purpose finally to avail
With whom demetrius had a great battle
This alisaundre which named was ballas
By Demetrius as put is in memory
First overcome and after fill this cas
He of demetrius had the victory
And to encres of his royal glory
Of fortune by sodeyne adventure
Ballus the field did of him recure
Thus by promocion of these kings three
When he was crownyd king of all Surrye
To falls extorcion and hateful cruelte
This alisaundre did his wits apply
To robbynge pillage and eke tyranny
And despised shortly to conclude
The seyde kings of Ingratitude
He had forget his state of pouerte
Knew not him silf of falls ^mbicion
Weddyd the daughter of worthy tholome
Called Cleopatra as made is mention
And all his labor in conclusion
Was only this in bochas as I read
All the kingdom about him to possede
Who all coueteth sometime all does lose
One again all seelde has souereynte
And for Ballas frowardly began chese
To hold werre with king tholome
And with the forsayde worthy kings three
All of assent have such weyes sought
That by their werkynge he was brought to naught
First tholome fro him took his wife
Cleopatra and took her in marriage
To one demetrye causing full great strife
For he that time was but young of age
But ballas after by full great outrage
With all his power gadred nigh and far
Geyne demetrye began to hold werre
Togedre met proudly in battle
Ballas constreyned cowardly to fle
And when he saw his power did fail
In arabye a mighty strong cuntre
zabydus a prince of great poustye
Took him by force quakinge in his dread
To king tholome sent anon his head
Men may two things considre in this cas
Pride punysshyd and unkindness
And presumpcion in this man ballas
Without title or cleyme of rightwysnesse
Made king of surry set in great worthynesse
What was his end ye get no more of me
His head smet of and sent to tholome
Lenuoye
tHis tragedye does naturally complain
Upon this vice called unkindness
Which to punissh is torment none ne pain
Rygour condygne flagell nor duresse
Emprisonynge nor none erthely distress
That may suffice breuely to conclude
Ageyn the vice of ingratitude
All creatures on this vice complain
Law nature decres rightwisnesse
This monstre in kind does the light disteyne
Of every virtue dyrketh the brightness
Alisaundre can bear hereof witness
Which to his furthrers he of his tetchis rude
Showed ageynwarde great ingratude
Of herberus thynfernall treble cheyne
Nor of tantalus hungre nor thrustnesse
Of Ixion or Ticius both tweyne
Rekne the turment remember the sharpness
All to little to chastyse or redress
The hateful vice of them that can delude
Their frendys old by falls ingratitude
Noble princes which in your demeyne
Have governance of all wordly richesse
Geyn folk unkind look that ye disdeyne
Suffer them not have none interesse
For taproche to your hye noblesse
For there is no vice more hateful to conclude
Than is the vice of ingratitude
Here bochas writes of the Rebellions / and Sedycions in Rome between Tribunys
and Commons.
Following mine aucto^ in stories merueilous
I must now write the strong rebellions
Of Gaius first and of Tiberius
And of the great hateful sedicions
Meued in rome twene tribunys and commons
And by their stryues how they began conspyre
For tatteyne falsely to the Eempyre
The year six hundred by computacion
Geyns graccus made tribune in that age
After the cytees first fundacion
Which turned after to full great damage
Of common profit for by their mortal rage
Tumulte and noise of commons in the town
Caused a great part of their destruction
For in departinge of chau^payne heritages
Atwene the worthy and pore of the cite
By egall porcions graccus with fayrelangage
Had greatly meuyd all their comonte
By which occasion in story men may se
Another graccus called the secou^de
Was slain in rome and low leyde in ground
After this death of Graccus as I read
Was chosyn a trybune callid Munycyus
Which fordyd the laws all in deed
Of old graccus called Gayus
But he that was named Tyberius
With help of flaccus Tribunys of estate
In the capytoyle began a great debate
They were supported by the comonte
Be voys of people the word of noman know
For Graccus party hye upon a tree
A trumpet stood and proudly began to blow
Which slain was and fro the tree down throw
By which slaughter the book makes rehersayle
Flaccus wexe feeble his party began to fail
For dread he fled into the teritorye
Of Ianus temple ran up to a toure
When Tyberius as put is in memory
Saw in the cite he had no favor
Despeyred knew no better socoure
Sword set at breest presence of myuerue
Fully purposed before her for to stern
There stood one by and drew his hand abak
Fro that purpose made him to declyne
Thus graccus party goth day by day to wrak
And Flaccus took the temple of Lucyne
His son his frendys almoost all his line
They kept them strong but maugre their diffence
They were there slain by sturdy violence
While Graccus friends faught for his pertye
And he him silf constreyned was of dread
To pray a boy of his company
To take a sword and smite of his head
Set on a spear with the blood made read
Sent it his mother compleynynge in her tene
In to her castle that called was missene
Named Cornelya his mother was in deed
Whilom daughter to great Scipion
Her children all slain as I read
And graccus godys acheted to the town
Thereof after made a division
By Judgment throughout the cite
Where most was need among the comonte
Of graccus side five hundred slain and tweyne
Upon an hill called a^entyne
And Oppynyus a consul did his pain
Of their conspirynge the ground to search and mine
And flaccus party to bring to ruin
He slough two thousand by hasty Judgment
Among which was many an Innocent
How the wife of hastruball burnt her silf and her children.
HEre John bochas list in especyall
^o remember how cartage new again
Destroyed was and how has^^uball
Came to mischeef the troth was well seyn
(...) to reherce of new it were but vein
^ith here tofore is made clear mention
Loath of their brennynge and their destruction
Sa^e here he tell^th how hastrubals wife
^^ly teschewe to live in seruage
Cha^e with her children for to lose her lif
And wylfully of furious courage
She and her sonnys tender and young of age
Among the flamys and the colys reed
Consumed was into ashes deed
Nido the first that bylte that cite
And made toures and the strong wall
Which was betrasshed also of Enee
Before remembered the fyres funeral
And after long the wife of hastruball
Chafe rather dye with her children tweyne
Than among romans for to live in pain
Of Machabeus Ioathas take by the king of Surrie
IN order suynge unto John Bochas
There apperyd an heavy man of sight
Machabeus the worthy Ioathas
Which occupied for wysdom and for might
Office of prince preesthode and of knight
By title of Judah of werrys took thempryse
By claim of leuy as priest did sacrifyse
The law of Iewys manly to diffende
With all the land of promyssion
This Ioathas full knightly did entende
Ageyn all enmyes about them enuyron
Till of surrie the false king triphon
By treynes compassyd and promys falslyholde
Took Ioathas of whom rightnowe I told
Machabeorum is reherced all
Of his knighthode and of his worthiness
With all the tresons in especial
Wrought by Triphon by many great falsnesse
His subtle sleightes and his doubleness
Them to reherce ye get no more of me
For in the bible the story ye may se
How Demetrius the second lost at the last his head.
But I will return to demetrius
That called was demetrius the soconde
Which by discente came fro anthiochus
And by his manhood as it was well found
Did the pride of king ball as confound
Called alisaundre which by great outrage
Had put his fadre fro his heritage
This demetrius famous and notable
Upon parthoys had many great victory
Till king arsacides double and deceyuable
Him silf delytynge greatly in vaynglorye
By his sleighty frauds deceptorie
Under a shadow of feynynge and falls chere
Took demetrius unwarily prysonere
And to great hindringe and sclaundre of his name
Arsacydes by a manner mockerye
Made demetrius for dispyte and shame
Poorly arrayed of hate and great envy
For to be led through all Gurye
Made him after by great auysement
To wedde his daughter ageyn his own intent
This demetrius was kept out of pres
That but few had of him sight
Unto time that Arsacides
Was deed and passed for all his great might
Than he cast to escape away by flight
And secretly to accomplyssh his intent
He gate him counseyle that was of his assent
Gallimandrus a lord of that cuntre
Which that was of his assente in deed
In their flight to keep them more secre
Made demetrius for to change his wede
And preuy ways forth he did him led
But all for naught his flight was but in vein
For by strong pursuit he was take again
After by constreynt presentyd to the king
That he began wexe weary of his life
Kept more streghtly folk on him waiting
And maugre him presentyd to his wif
With her to abide full heavy and pensif
But when they had children atwene them tweyne
To go more large losyd was his cheyne
And thus he had space and fre license
To go and come at his advantage
For while his wife held with him resydence
They dempt his children were suffisaunte hostage
But he was ever unstable of his courage
With Gallymandrus the forseyde knight
Three times take and brought ageyn by flight
And for he was so diverse manyfolde
King Fraactes in tokne he was unstable
Sent him three dees forged square of gold
To play raket as a child chaungeable
His disposicion was so variable
But for to restreyne his condition
He was eft take and fettryd in prison
But when fortune had given him a pulle
By many diverse strange aduersite
To punissh him more Pharages wexith dull
And demetrius of prison was made fre
Full restoryd again to his cuntre
Wexe proud again of new it is so fall
That he was hated of his liegys all
Cleopatra his modre that was queen
Of all egypt and wif to Thotome
Was with her lord at stryf who list seen
Which turned after to great aduersite
But to strength her party thus wrought she
Made her son for to take on hand
For her to fight again her husbonde
But tholomeus called euergetes
Geyn demetrius deffendynge his cuntre
Made zebenna to put him silf in pres
Son of a merchant borne of low degree
To make a claim by falls subtylte
Of all surrie to have possession
For him alledgynge title of adopcion
He to be son to Antiochus
Claymynge thereby the kingdom of surrye
Only texclude the seid demetrius
And Tholomeus to sustene the pertye
Of zebenna with all his chyualrye
Gadred in egypt and cuntrees enuyron
Ageyn demetrius proudly is cu^me down
And fortune with her double face
Caused the cuntre by rebellyon
That demetrius stood clean out of grace
Whereby the people of that region
Were hole again him in their opinion
That by Tholomes wonderful werkinge
zebenna there received was as king
Thus zebenna by falls intrusion
Of all Surre was made lord and king
Title was there non but collusion
Texclude demetrius by subtle compassynge
Yet as I find his pertye diffendinge
How demetryus zebenna began assail
Their quarrel darreynyd with a great battle
Great people slain upon outher side
Demetrius put from his region
And overcome for his great pride
At great mischeef to his confusion
Having no socour nor consolacion
But with afewe chose of his meyne
Fled by water to tire the cite
Like as he would have lived there in pes
By a feynt manner of perfection
Within the temple of mighty hercules
Under a shadow of religion
But suddenly at his coming down
Into Tire and at his arryuayle
His head smet of what did his pride avail
How zebenna king of surre by intrusion entryn^ had mischeuous ending.
t^ouchinge zebenna of who^ I spak toforn
Poorly brought up and of low lynage
And of kindred but a beggar borne
Came tofore bochas trift of his visage
Sore weeping mu^t of langage
Began compleyn his woeful adventure
Unware and sodeyne impossible to recure
His conditions sumwhat dull and rude
First in pouerte proud and presumptuous
Appechid after of great Ingratitude
Showed in his lif to king antiochus
His first furtherer the story tells thus
For which antiochus greatly was anoyed
Cast amene by which he was destroyed
There was a co^yn that called was Grispus
To antiochus and of the same line
Which by title of demetrius
Cleymeth as heir by many uncouth sign
To regne in Surrye and proudly began malign
Ageyn zebenna whoos party to supporte
Stood antiochus cheef as I can report
This seyde Grispus young and tender of age
By the forthringe and supportacion
Of antiochus had in marriage
His own daughter with great possession
That zebenna for short conclusion
Compelled was for all his great might
To antioche for to take his flight
And there he fill in so great pouerte
Failed money for to pay wages
The sondyours which in that cuntre
Abide upon him of all manner ages
Strange folk and sundry of langages
Theuys murdrers mansleets and pillours
First of Iubiter asseylynge the tresours
To his disclaundre perpetuel of memory
The diffame aros so manyfolde
In Iouis temple the banere of victory
He took away that was of massyf gold
With a great image that stood there of old
Of gold also with other mo tresours
With which pyllage he paid the soudyours
Of sacrilege having no conscience
Tescape awey he entryd is the se
But ^olus by great violence
With wind and tempeste as he did fle
Did unto him full great aduersite
And all his meyne forsook him of intent
And he was take and to grispus sent
King of surrie to whom when he was brought
Gave on him by judgment this sentence
For sacrilege that he had wrought
Spoylynge temples by great violence
Doing to goddys no manner reverence
For which grispus co^maundyd has as Judge
That he to be slain there was no better refuge
Of birth a boy clambe up to royal stage
Brought up of naught and set in dignyte
Knew not him silf wex cruel of courage
Aros fro pouert to great prosperyte
But through fortunes mutabylite
That blind lady so made her power stretche
As he began to end as a wretch
Rekned thestatis of worldly regalie
Noumbre of meyne gold tresour and richesse
Statly castles paleis on each party
Conquest by fortune clymbinge to hye noblesse
Cruel sword conveyed by wylfulnesse
Power extorte with couetyse oppressynge
Causes destruction of many erthely king
But in contrary who list him silf know
And is by grace enclyned to meekness
Though he fro pouerte in streytnes brought up
And is by virtue enclyned to worthynesse
With scepter of pes and sword of rightwisnesse
Indifferently his domys demenynge
Suchone is able to be clepyd a king
What is cheef cause ground and occasion
That princis often stand in Ieopertye
Of wordly chaungys in such division
Regnynge among them the serpent of envy
Symulacion faynynge flaterye
The soth out serchyd who so list to look
By many tragedye expert in this book
How Bitynctus king of auergnatus / by the Romans was taken and dyed in
prison
BItynctus next of Auergnatis king
Came tofore bochas gynnynge his co^pleint
Of his distress thordre rehersinge
And how that he was made feeble and feynte
Again the romans mischeuously atteynt
Not withstondynge to mayntene his quarrel
He cast of pride again them to rebel
But it is first put in remembrance
How Auergnatis is a nation
Hanging on gaul longs unto france
Of which Bytinct stood in possession
Having despite in his opynion
To the romans any wise to obey
But proudly cast again them to werrey
His labor was to stand in fraunchise
And be at large from their subjection
Began of pride their lordship to despise
Gadred people of presumpcion
Whom for to mete fabius was sent down
A mighty consul which knightly took on hand
For that party Bytinctus to withstonde
Of whoos coming bytinctus took disdeyne
Because the folk which fabyus did led
Were but few and when he has them seyne
He said of scorn this people who takes head
May not suffice mine houndys for to feed
When they be slain to few they be in noumbre
With multitude that I shall them encoumbre
An hundryd thousand in his vauwarde he had
That pass should of auuernere the ryuere
And four score thousand beside that he lad
The consul fabius met him with good chere
When he was passyd of rodamus the daungere
Faught all the day till it drew to night
The romans wan their soon were put to flight
At the Ryuere like as seith the book
There were drownyd and brough to myschaunce
Fyfty thousand as they the water took
Through fortunes froward variaunce
And by atreyne tencres of his greuaunce
Bitinc^us take was of the romeyns
Dampened to prison there to dye in cheyns
How the tyrant Euergetes weddyd queen Cleopatras slough her eldest son /
exiled his wife weddyd her daughter
AFetr whose death pitously to read and seen
Of Epiphones the great tholome
Came the daughter cleopatras the queen
Began complain her great auersite
Her sorrow furious diffaced her beute
Her chekys white of blood and terys meynt
Rent with her handys were pitously bespreynt
To philomeetir she weddyd was aforne
Whilom son to tholome the king
And by her lord in true wedlok borne
Two sonnys she had as by old writynge
After whoos death anon up suynge
To Euergetes a prince young of age
She was again Joined in marriage
By title of her in Egypt lord and sire
King of that land cruel and dispytous
Whoos storye shows no kyngedom nor empire
May of them silf make no man virtuous
For like a tygre this tiraunt furious
Her eldest son day of their marriage
Born to be heir he slough of mortal rage
Not after long this extort cruelte
Albe they had children atwene them tweyne
Out of egypt he made her for to fle
And of malice he began at her disdeyne
I trow she had matter for to pleyne
He took her daughter when that she was gone
Ageyn nature and weddyd her anon
She called was Cleopatras also
But euergetes to show him more vengeable
Again her modre that was fro Egypt go
The cite which was to her favorable
The people exiled he wode and vntretable
In her despite gave that notable town
Of hatfull malice to strange nation
But when he knew through his cruel dedys
And began conceive how he was coupable
Saw again him the manyfolde hatredes
And conspiracion of statys honorable
He at large to be more vengeable
Geyne cleopatras to gynne an uncouth stryf
Went into exil with his new wif
Gadred people his old wife to assail
On her children to show more vengeance
A day assigned held with her battle
But which of them was dryuyn to vt^raunce
Mine auctour plainly put not in remembrance
But suynge after thus of him I read
How of malice he wrought a cruel deed
Which to reherce is nouthir good ne fair
But terryble and abhomynable
He dismembered her son and his hair
On pe^ys small this tyrant most vengeable
And when the mother sat at her royal ^able
With body and head at a solempnyte
Let her be served of froward cruelte
Whereof all Egypt had indignacion
And for to avenge his cruel great outrage
They took his plates basnet haberion
And his cote armure wrought of great costage
Fro their templys rent out his image
In tokne he was a tiraunt most atteynt
Each thing diffaced that was of him depeynt
Whoos hateful story replete of wretchidnesse
Full of vengeance and froward myscheuys
Therefore I deem bochas list not express
More of his life fulfilled of all repreuys
Of cleopatra write not the fynall greuys
In this chaptre what fatal wey she took
Lest the matere should difface his book
How Iugurta of by intrusion of Munedy King slough rightful heiris and after
himsilf was drownyd
aFter this woeful dedly adventure
Of cleopatras whoos story is full old
Came Iugurta the manly man to lure
And to John bochas has his tale told
Of his conqueste and deeds many fold
Subtle of wit and as mine auctour seith
Gave lityll force for to break his feyth
But in order the story to conueye
Of Iugurta and of his kynrede
Masmissa king of munedie soth to sey
His uncle was and also as I read
The seyde king had a son in deed
Called mysipsa eldest in writynge
After his day to regne as king
This Masmyssa ordained afterward
Tofore his death of hole entencion
Because Iugurta was borne a basterde
To depryue of all succession
In his testament but in conclusion
His son mysipsa afterward made king
Was to Iugurta friendly and loving
Mysipsa had two sons as I find
The tone of them called herbales
The second the story makes mention
Was that time named hyem sales
With whom Iugurta put him silf in pr^es
For to abide and dwell in especial
Like as their cosyn in their court royal
Cherisshed full well because that he was wys
And right likly of disposicion
Chosyn afterward for a singular prys
To go to spaigne to help scipion
Geyne Mumentaynes a famous mighty town
And there Iugurta so knightly has begone
That by his nobles the town anon was won
And to remember his knighthode of intent
His worthynesse and his hye renoun
To misipsa letters were down sent
By the forsayde worthy scipion
Which gave so great a commendacion
To Iugurta him calling in that wer^e
Of manly prowes the young lode ste^e
Of king mysipsa receyuyd notably
Called him son by adopcion
The king did sone Iugurta traytourly
Slough hiempsales heir by succession
He of that realm to have possession
This was his custum how ever the title stood
By slaughter and murdre for to get good
He list to goddys do no reverence
Of his nature wylfull and recheles
Having nouther remors nor conscience
Touching the slaughter of hi^msales
Falsely practysed for his own encres
For which murdre romans have sent down
A consulere to do correction
Calipurnius called that was sent
Only to punissh that horrible deed
But with tresoure his iyen were so blent
Of execucion that he took none head
The romans overcome with mede
Gave to Iugurta by collusion
Of this murdre a colored falls pardon
By which he took a manner hardynesse
Of tyranny in him well excercised
Gadred people of hateful cursydnesse
And in him silf began cursedly deuyse
Texecute the silf same guyse
Of falls murdre I mean now none other
To slay herbales the second brother
That he alone by falls intrusion
Of Numedye might be lord and king
Thus of his cruelte murdre and falls treson
The noise was borne by langage and by writynge
Of which the griffis falsely a broad spredinge
Brought forth in hindringe of his name
Fruit of disclaundre and report of diffame
Mortal treson was cured under flowers
To save him silf by some subtylte
And specially with his great tresoures
Tappese the senate if it would have be
But therageyn all the comonte
Made again him a ^^iuracion
On his false murdre to do correction
Four thousand men of arms were down sen^
With a pre^to^^ called ^^ilius
The which pre^our set all his intent
To gadre tresour for he was covetous
And couetyse is contrarious
Unto knighthode as auctours all express
And stepmoder unto worthynesse
Asiege he laid about a mighty toure
Wherein Iugurta put all his richesse
The siege was laid for love of that tresour
More than for worship or for worthynesse
Whereby his name and his noblesse
There disconfyted brought unto mischaunce
After for meede made his alyaunce
With Iugurta to his encres of shame
Caused affryk through falls cheuisaunce
They togydre disclaundred by diffame
Them to withdraw fro thobeysaunce
Of the romans and more them silf tauaunce
To their purpos corrupted with tresour
Many tribune and many senator
Of new ageyn all the comonte
Fro rome sent Gayus marrius
For the murdres and horrible cruelte
Wrought by Iugurta the tyrant furious
Which to refourme the said gayus
A consulere of purpos was sent down
A manly knight and famous of renoun
Full notably the werres he began
Wrought every thing of hye providence
And fortune which helps hardy man
Gave him great favor by her influence
And aldre first he did his diligence
For to avoid all that werre vicious
Delicate people and folkys lecherous
A day was set and takyn a bataile
By Iugurta by falls subtylte
Proferyd much good which might not avail
To have corrupt if it would have be
The seyde marryus but ever in one degree
He stood ay stable upright as a wall
And took none head to his profre at all
Than Iugurta in party despeyred
Greatly astonyed within him silf musinge
But like ^^nan hyndred and appeyred
He began purpose anon a new thing
Of maurytayne he went to the king
To get help which called was boccus
Him to socour ageyn the gayus
Twene them was made of new an alliance
The which last but a little space
For king boccus began fall in repentance
Cast he would resort to the grace
Of the romans and no more trespace
And to perform this entencion
He made to Gayus this mediacion
There was one Scylla called a ques^oure
Of Gayus ost had governance
For king Boccus he was mediatoure
That there was newly accordaunce
Twene him and gayus and by the purueaunce
Of this Boccus Iugurta anon was hent
Maugre his might and to gayus sent
And all his kyngedom without resistance
Geyne to romans came under obeysaunce
And marrius forgave them their offense
Received them under assurance
That he shall not by dome do no vengeance
To punisshe the trespasses that they did aforn
The space accounted fro time they were born
Iugurta takyn almost for anger mad
Brought to rome and fetred in prison
To terpeya an hye hill he was lad
Judgment you for his false treson
Bound to a ston and after throw down
Fro the place full hye where he stood
Without mercy into tybre flode
Lenuoye.
THis may be well called a tragedye
By descripcion taking auctorite
For tragedye as poetys specefyt
Gynneth with joy ends with aduersite
From hye estate cast in low degree
Exaumple takyn this story seyth aright
Of Iugurta that was first a good knight
At his gynnynge famous in chiualrye
Gate Numentaigne of spain a great cite
But in repayringe home to that pertye
I mean when he came home to his cuntre
He changed knighthode in to cruelte
With couetise so blindyd was his sight
Of Iugurta that first was a good knight
His wit his powere he holy did apply
To hateful murdre fraud and subtilte
Bextort title him silf to magnify
Slough rightful heirs rest them their liberte
By falls intrusion clambe up to their se
And gave no force whether it were wrong or right
A thing contrary to every worthy knight
Noble princes lift up your hertes ^ye
Within your silf remember and do se
Of this murdre the hateful tyranny
With oppression done to the comonte
His gynnynge good a cursed end had he
Murdre cries vengeance day and night
A thing contrary to every worthy knighty
Explicit Liber Quintus.
Incipit liber Sextus Here Bochas sittinge in his study alone^ writes a
great process: how Fortune like amonstruous Image / Having an hundryd
handys appperyd unto him and spoke: and Bochas unto her: making between them
both many great Argumentys: and resons of fortunes chauncys.
iN his study alone as bochas stood
His pen in hand of soden adventure
To remember he thought it did him good
How that no man may him silf assure
In worldly things fully to recure
Grace of fortune to make her to be stable
Her daily chaunges be so variable
She braydeth ever on the chau^tplure
Now song now weeping now woe now gladness
Now in mirth now peyn to endure
Now light now heavy now bitter now swetnes
Now in trouble now fre now in distres
Showing to us a manner resemblaunce
No wordly wealth has here non assurance
While bochas pensif stood sole in his librarye
With chere oppressed pale in his visage
Sumdell abashed alone and solytarye
To him appeared a monstrous Image
Parted on tweyne of color and courage
Her right side full of somer flowers
The tothyr oppressed with wynters stormy shoures
Bochas astonyed feerfull for to abrayde
When he beheld the wonderful figure
Of fortune thus to him silf he said
What may this mean is this a creature
Or a monstre transfourmed ageyns nature
Whoos brennynge iyen sparklyng of their light
As do sterres the frosty winter night
And of her chere full good head he took
Her face semynge cruel and terryble
And by disdeyne manasynge of look
Her here vntrussyd hard sharp and horrible
Froward of shap lothsom and odyble
An hundred hands she had of each part
In sundry wise her gyftys to depart
Su^me of her hondes list up men alofte
To hye estate of wordly dignite
Another hand griped full vnsofte
Which cast another in great aduersite
Gave one richesse an other pouerte
Gave su^me also by report a good name
Noysed another of sclaundre and diffame
Her habit was of manyfolde colors
Watchet blewe of feyned steadfastness
Her gold allayed like son in wattry shoures
Meynt with light grene for change and doblenesse
A pretens red dread meynt with hardynesse
White for clennes like sone for to fail
Feynt black for mourning russet for travail
^yr colors meynt of wollys more than one
Su^me while eclypsyd su^me while she shone bright
Dull as an ass when men had haste to gone
And as a swalowe gerissh of her flight
Twene sloughth and swyft now crooked now upright
Now as a creple low coorbyd down
Now a duery now a chaumpion
Now a cowarde durst not come in prees
Now sumwhile hardy as a lion
Now like Ector now dredefull Thersites
Now was she cresus now agamenon
Sa^ danapallus of condition
Now was she ma^nyssh now was she femynyne
Now could she rain now could she falsely shine
Now a mermeyde angilyk of face
A tail behind very serpentyne
Now debonaire now froward to do grace
Now as a lamb tretable and benign
Now like a wulfe of nature to malign
Now sirenes to sing folk aslepe
Till Caribdys drown them in the de^^e
Thus John bochas considringe her figure
All her fetures in order he began behold
Her bread her lingth her shap and her stature
An hundryd handys and armies there he told
Whereof astonyed his heart began wexe cold
And among all her members euerichon
He sempt she had no fete up to gone
And while that he considred all this thing
Twene them as it were in a trance
She suddenly toward him lokinge
He conceived by her countenance
Were it for Ire were it for plesaunce
Outher for favor outher for disdeyne
By the manner she would sumwhat feyne
Lokynge ascoyne as she had had disdeyne
Bochas quod she I know all thyn entente
How thou trauaylest besyest the in vain
In thy study ever diligent
Now in the west now in the oryent
To sech stories north and meredien
Of worthy princes that here tofore have been
Su^me dwelled under the pole artike
By my favor vpreysed to the sterrys
Outher under the pool antartyke
Which in contrary fro us so far is
Su^me encresyd and set up by the werrys
Like as me list their triumphs to auaunce
Frowning on other I brought them to mischaunce
I se the besy remembrynge by scriptures
Stories of pryncis in every manner age
As my favor followed their auentures
By humble style set in plain langage
Not made curious by none advantage
Of rethorikes with musys for to strive
But in pleyne form their dedys to descryue
In which process thou do great diligence
As they deserve to give them thank or blame
Settyst up one in royal excellence
Within mine house called the house of fame
The golden trumpet with blastys of good name
Enhaunceth one to full hye parties
Where Iupyter sits among the heavenly skies
Another trumpet of sownys full vengeable
Which blows up at festys funeral
Nothing bright but of color sable
Far fro my favor dedly and mortal
To plonge princis from their estate royal
When I am wroth to make them lo^^e low
Than of malice I do that trumpet blow
Thou have wretyn and set togedre in groos
Like their deserte wordly mennys dedys
Nothing conceled nor under covert cloos
Spared the crowns nor their purpul wedes
Their golden scepters but you to them there medys
Crowned one with laurer hye on his head up set
Other with peruynke made for the gibet
Tus dyuersly my gifts I depart
One accepted another is refused
Like haserdours my dees I do iuparte
One well furthered another is accused
My play is double my trust is ever abused
Though one to day my favor has won
Tomorowe again I can eclipse his son
Cause of my cu^mynge pleynly to declare
By good auys unto thy presence
Is to show my manners and not spare
And my conditions breuely in sentence
Preuyd of old and new experience
Pleynly to show me list not for to rowne
To day I flater tomorowe I can well frown
This hour I can show me merciable
And suddenly I can be dispytous
Now well wylled hastily vengeable
Now sobre of chere now hasty and furious
My play uncouth my manners marvelous
Brayde on the wind now glad and now I mourn
Like a wedre cok my fate each day I turn
Wherein Bochas I tell the yet again
Thou do folly thy wittys for to plye
All thy labor thou spyllest in vain
Geyn my manners so fully to replye
By thy writynge to find a remedy
To interupte in thy last dawes
My statutys and my custu^able laws
All the labor of philosophers old
Travail of poetys my manners to deprave
Has been of yore to seylyke as they would
Over my fredom the souereynte to have
But of my laws the lybertees to save
Upon my whele they shall them not diffende
But when me list that they shall discende
Why should men put me in blame
To follow the nature of my double play
With new buddys does not ve^ the same
When prymerose appear fresshe and gay
To day they show tomorwe gone away
Su^mer after of flowers has foyson
Till June with sithes after mow them down
Now is the se calm and blaundisshinge
Now are the wyndes confortable and still
Now is boreas sturdy in blowynge
Which young sheep and blosmes greueth ill
Why also should I not have my will
To show misilf now smothe and after trouble
Since to my kind it longs to be double
Noman so far is fall in wretchidnesse
But that he stands in trust to rise again
Nor none so deep plonged in distress
Nor with despeyre nor wanh^pe ouerleyne
But that there is su^me hope left certain
To give him confort serving his intent
To be releuyd when me list assent
The earth is clad in motlayes white and read
When escas enter with violettes sote
The greeuys grene and in every meede
The bawme fleteth which does to hertys bote
August passed ageyn in to the rote
By course of nature the virtue does resort
To reuolucion to kind I me report
Who should than debar me to be double
Since doublenes longs to me of right
Now fressh with somer now with winter trouble
Now blind of look derke as the cloudy night
Now glad of chere of heart merry and light
They be but foles ageyn my might to muse
Or me atwyte though I my power use
Seeld or never I bide not in one point
Men must at lowpys take me as they find
And when I stand ferthest out of Joint
To set folks bakwarde far behind
Than wordly men with their iyen blind
Sore complain upon my doubleness
Call me thanne the froward falls goddess
Thus by your writynge and merueylous langage
I am disclaundryd of mutabilite
Whereof by right I catch a great advantage
Since doublenes no sclaundre is to me
Which is a persell of my liberte
To be called by title of rightwissnesse
Of chaungys new lady and princess
Thus when fortune had seyde her will
Parcel declared of her governance
Made a stynt and sobrely stood still
John bochas sat and herd all her dal^aunce
Feerfull of chere pale of countenance
In order enprentyd each thing that she said
Full demurely thus he did abrayde
He took upon him virtue and courage
Upon a point for to abide stable
Certys quod he like to thy visage
All wordly things be double and chaungeable
Yet for my part by remembrance notable
I shall perform sothly if I conne
This little book that I have begone
And lest my labor dye not nor appall
Of this book the title for to save
Among mine other lityll werkys all
With lettris large above upon my grave
This books name shall in stone be grave
How I John bochas in especial
Of wordly princes wretyn have the fall
Of which emprise the cause to deseryue
This was first ground I will not deny
To eschew sloth and vyses all my line
And specially the vice of glotonye
Which is norice unto lecherye
This was chef cause why I undertook
The compylacion of this little book
Yet by thy talkinge as I understand
Each thing here of nature is chaungeable
After thy sentence both on se and land
Yet could I rekne things that be stable
As virtuous lif abidinge vnmutable
Set hole to godwarde of heart will and thought
Maugre thy powere and ne changes naught
Thou may eke call unto remembrance
Things made stable by grace which is dyuyne
Have thou not herd the perseueraunce
Of holy martres which list not to declyne
Fro cristys feith till he did fine
Thy whele in them h^d none interesse
To make them vary fro their stablenesse
A man that is enarmed in virtue
Ageyn thy might to make resistance
And set his trust by grace in christ Ihu^
And has all hole his hertely aduertence
On rightwysnesse force and on prudence
With their suster called attemperaunce
Has a save condute again thy variaunce
They set no store by thy double whele
With supportacion of other ladies three
Their trust stand not in plate mayle or stele
But in these virtues feith hope and charity
Called virtues tholeogice
Which with four before here specefyed
Thy whele and the have utterly diffyed
If I with wings might fly to heuyn
There should I se thowe have no thing adone
With Jupiter nor the planettys seuene
With phoebus mars mercurye nor the moon
But worldly folys erly late and sone
Such as be blente or dyrkyd with lewdness
By falls opinyon call the a goddess
Gyftys of grace nor giftys of nature
Alms deed done with humylite
Love and compassion be far out of thy cure
Semelynesse strength bountye or beutye
Virtuously used in their degree
Geyn none of these thy powere may not stretch
For who is virtuous lyte of the does retch
Of thy conditions to set another preef
Which folys use in their aduersite
For excusacion as su^tyme seith a thief
When he is hangyd it was his destyne
Atwyteth fortune his Iniquite
As she had domynacion
To rule man by will ageyn reason
For which John bochas in party dissolate
To determyne such heuynly hyd secrees
To that be deuynes of estate
I remyt such uncouth priuytees
And poetys that be of low degrees
I eschew to clymbe to hye aloft
Hest for presumpcion I should not fall soft
But if I had hyd in my courage
Such mysteries of dyuyne prouydence
Without envy I would in pleyne langage
Vttre them by wrytinge with humble reverence
Predestynacion nouther prescience
Not apperteyne fortune unto the
And for my part I will excuse me
And proceed like as I undertook
After that I told my matere
Of fall of princes for to write a book
But yet before if thou would here
I desire of hole heart and entere
To have a copye of princes names all
Which fro thy whele thou have made to fall
Thy secre bosom is full of stories
Of sundry princys how they their lif have lad
Of their tryumphes and victoryes
Which old poetis and philosophers sad
In meter and prose compyled have and rad
Song their lauds their fatys eke reserved
By remembrance as they have disserued
Of which I have put su^me in memory
Thereon set my study and my labor
So as I could to their encres of glory
Though of langage I had but small favor
Cause caliope did me no socoure
For which thou have during all this while
Rebuked me of my rude style
Men would accoumpte it were a great dullness
But if langage conveyed be by prudence
Out declared by sobre auysenesse
Under support favored by diffence
Of tullius cheef prince of eloquence
Should more profit shortly to conclude
Than my style spoke in terms rude
Yet often time it has be felt and seyne
Under huskys growing on land Arable
Has be found and tried out good greyne
Under rude leuys shaking and unstable
Pullyd fair fruit holsom and delytable
And semblably where rethorike has failed
In blunte termys good counsel has auayled
Philosophers of the golden ages
And poetis that fond out fressh dyters
As king amphion with his fair langages
And with his harpyng made folk of low degrees
And laborers to enhabyte first cites
And so by musyke and philosophy
Began first of commons noble policy
The cheef of music is melodye and accord
Well of philosophy sprange out of prudence
By which two menys began unity and accord
With politic virtue to have their asistence
Wise men to regne subiettis do reverence
And by this ground in stories men may se
Were bylte the walls of thebes cite
Accord in musyk causes the melodye
Where is discord there is dyuersite
And where is pes is prudent policye
In each kingdom and every great cuntre
Stryf first inducyd by thy duplicite
For which thou may as clerkys the descryues
Be called lady of contekys and of stryues
First were found out hateful divisions
By thy contrived falls mutabylytes
Slaughter debate froward discencions
In regions prouyncis and cites
Desolacions of towns and of cuntres
Wherefore men had first experience
By thy chaungeable gery violence
Thus by the oppynyon of thy whele most double
As fair by nature as it was possible
Ouerthwertly thou broughtest men in trouble
Made each to other froward and odible
By thy treynys uncouth and terrible
Like a corsour makes coltes that be wild
With spore and whyp to be tame and mylde
Thus by the tempest of thyn aduersitees
To make men more tame of their corages
In their discordes twene kyngdoms and cytes
After the sharp of thy cruel rages
Only by speech and mean of fair langages
Folk by thy fraud fro grace far exyled
Were by fair spech to unite reconsyled
People of greece of rome and of cartage
Next in Itayle with many a region
Were indusyd by swetnesse of fair langage
To have togydre their conversation
To bylde castelles and many royal town
What caused this to tell in breef the form
But eloquence rude people to enfourme
Before time they were but bestyall
Till they to reason by laws were constreyned
Under discrecion by statutis natural
Fro wylfull lustys by prudence were restreyned
By assente made one and to gydre encheyned
In golden cheynys of pees and unite
Thus began the beeldynge of every great Cite
But when thou medlyst to have an interesse
They that were one to bring them at discord
To interupte with thy doubleness
Cites regions that were of one accord
Like as this book can bear me well record
Fro the time that thou first began
Thy mutabylite has stroyed many a man
Thou causest men to be obstynat
In their corages and incorigible
Wilful froward causeles at debat
Each to other contrarious and odible
Them to refourme almost impossible
Till fair spech voydinge division
Pes reconciled twene many a region
For there is none so furious outrage
Nor no matter so far out of the wey
But that by mean of gracious langage
And fair spech may a man convey
To all reason mekely for to obey
By an exaumple which I reherce shall
Well to purpos and is historyall
The hardy knight the cruel achilles
When hateful Ire assailed his courage
There was no mean with him to trete of pes
To still the tempest of his doolfull rage
Save only this which did his Ire aswage
By attempraunce to obey to reason
When of an harp he herd the sweet sou^
Which instrument by his great swetnesse
Put all rancoure out of his remembrance
Wrested him again to all gladness
From him auoydinge all rancoure and greuaunce
Semblably fair spech and daliaunce
Set men in rest in realmys here and yonder
By good langage that were far asondre
With these wordys bochas wexe debonaire
Toward fortune as he cast his look
Withdrewe his rancoure and to speak fair
Touching his labor which upon him took
Besechinge her for to furthre his book
That his name which was lityll know
By good report might be ferther blow
That his name might ferther sprede
Which stood as yet shrowdyd in derknesse
By her favor his name forth to lead
His book to furthre do her business
By good roport to give it a brightness
With laur^ate stremys shad forth to people all
By foryetfulnesse that it never appalle
This was the bylle which that John Bochas
Made unto fortune with full humble style
When fortune had conceived all his cas
Sobyrly stood and began stynt a while
And glad of chere after she began smyle
On mine auctoure and with a fressh visage
In sentence spoke to him this langage
Hic loquitur Fortuna
SOthly quod she Ise thy business
Of mortal men how coryous that they be
How they study by great auysnesse
Of my secretys for to be preue
To know the conceytys hyd within me
And my counseyles ye men do all your pain
Albe that lightly ye may not thereto atteyne
In this matter your with does never feynt
Imagenynge likeness in your mind
Like your conceytis ye forge men and peynt
Sumtyme a woman with wings set behind
And portrayen me with iyen that been blind
Cause of all this breuely to express
Is your own covetous blyndnesse
Your appetytis most strange and diverse
And full ever of change and doubleness
Froward also malicious and peruers
By hasty climbinge to worship and richesse
Alweye void of troth and stablenesse
Most presumptuous search out in all degrees
Falsely tatteyne to wordly dignitees
Bochas bochas I perceive every thing
And know full well the great difference
Hyd in thy silf of wordys and thinking
Atwene them both the disconuenience
Have thou not wretyn many great sentence
In thy book to sclaundre with my name
Of hole intent my manners to diffame
Thou call me step mother most unkind
And sumtyme a falls chaunteresse
A mermayde with a tail behind
Of scorn sumwhile me namynge a goddess
Sumtyme a witch sumtyme a sorceresse
Fynder of murdre and of deceitys all
Thus of malice mortal men me call
All this done in despite of me
By accusacion in many sundry wise
Ye often appech my mutabylite
Namely when I your requestys do despise
For to accomplissh your gredy couetise
When ye fail ye lay on me the wit
Of your aduersitees me falsely to atwite
And thou of purpos for tesclaundre me
Have written ungoodly a contrarious fable
How I wrestlyd with glad pouerte
To whoos party thou were favorable
Settyst me abak geyne me thou were vengeable
Now of new requeryst my favor
The for to help and furthre thy labor
As skauns I am of manners most chaungeable
Of conditions very femynyne
Now here now there as the wind unstable
By thy descripcion and by thy doctrine
To every change ready to enclyne
As wymen been young and tender of age
Which of nature be diverse of courage
But for to furthre in pertye thyn intent
That of thy book the process may proceed
By my favor to the accomplisshment
I am well wyllyd to help the in thy need
Like thy desire the better thou shall speed
When I am toward with a benygne face
To speed thy journey by supporte of my grace
That thy name and also thy surname
With poetys and notable old auctours
May be regest^yd in the house of fame
By supportacion of my sodeyn favors
By assistence also of my socours
Thy work texplete the laurer for to win
At Saturnynus I will that thou begin
Here reherceth Fortune her conditions unto bochas showing how many one she
enhaunced for a time / and anon after them suddenly overthrows
Among Romans this seyde saturnyne
Was outrageous of condition
Caused in rome when he began malign
Great debatys and great sedicious
And by his froward conspiracions
He was sharp enmy again the prudent judge
Called metellus deuoyde of all refuge
Fro the capitoyle set with mighty hand
Fond no socoure metellus in the town
The same time thou shall understand
How by mine help and supportacion
One that was small of reputacion
Called Glabeya in pouert brought low
Made consulere the story is well know
A servant first and almoost set at naught
And afterward I made him fortunate
Left never till I had him brought
By a prerogatyf chose of the senate
To be a pretoure an office of estate
Which also wrought by conspiracion
To bring metellus to destruction
Of whoos assent there was also another
Called marrius being the same year
Texplete this treson their own sworn brother
Which was also that time a consulere
I fortune made them full good chere
Like their desires gave them liberte
To banissh metellus out of their cite
Of these three romans the first saturnyne
And glaucia was called the second
And marrius laid out hoke and line
As I have told metellus to confound
To their purpos I was also found
Favorable to bring them to mischeef
As their storye shows an opyn preef
They banysshed him out of rome town
And saturnynus by his subtle werkynge
Clambe up fast of presumpcion
To be called of rome lord and king
I gave him favor by a manner falls smiling
Till at the last plainly to declare
Of his destruction I brought him in the snare
The senators knowing the malice
Of Saturn which made a great gad ring
Of sundry folk casting in his auyce
By their favor he might be called king
All this while of his up clymbynge
I showed him during a long space
Him to desceyue a benygne face
Till marryus a mighty consulere
To withstonde his presumpcion
Rose with stronghande and with aknightly chere
Beset his pal^ys about enuyron
Brake his gatys amyd of the town
And saturnynus void of all favor
To the capytoyle fled for socoure
He was forbarred by marrius of vitayle
The Capitoile beseged round about
At the entringe was a strong bataile
On outher pertye slain a great route
Thus of my favor he began stand in donte
Thus saturnynys brought in great distress
His good achetyd lost all his richesse
Experience full openly men bears
Such as highest thereupon ascend
Like as the turn of my whele requires
When they leest wene down they shall descend
They have no power them silf to diffende
Again my might when they been overthrow
What do I than but laugh and make a mow
^rusus also borne of great lynage
And descendyd of full hye noblesse
Unto virtue contrary of his courage
Froward found to all gentylnesse
Yet chose he was the storye does express
Questoure of asya an office of degree
For his birth to govern that cuntre
But often time virtue nor gentylnesse
Come not to heirs by succession
Exaumple in Drusus the story bears witness
Which both of courage and disposicion
Was ever froward of condition
For which let men deem as they must nedys
Not after birth but after the dedys
Virtues all in him were set aside
Slow to be armed hated chivalry
Most covetous deynous full of pride
His dedys froward full of treachery
To hye estate I did him magnefie
Yet all my giftys in him ne might stre^ch
For here tofore the he comes like a wretch
He dare for shame not show his visage
So far disclaundryd is his wretchydnesse
Whose couetyse and vicious outrage
Falsely caused by his doubleness
Maguldusa a prince of great noblesse
Betrasshed was for mede to the king
Called boccus by drusus falls werkynge
What manner torment or what grievous pain
Were competent couenable or condign
To him that can outward flater and feyne
And in his heart covertly malign
As drusus did which showed many sign
To Maguldusa of love and frendlihede
Underneath falls treson hyd in deed
But maguldusa like a manly knight
Geyn king boccus has him silf socoured
When he by dome was Iuged again right
Of an olifaunt for to be devoured
Escaped freely and after that labored
To acquyte him silf through his hye renoun
Slough falls Drusus myd of rome town
Bochas also men put the lak in me
That I was cause of the destruction
By my contrarious mutabylite
Of the notable famous scipion
Which in the time of cynsoryn caton
Gate the triumph for many great victory
To put his name perpetually in memory
For his merytes chose a consulere
And cheef busshop to govern their cite
To all the Senate patron most entere
Most famous of name and dignite
Saved romans from all aduersite
Time when the werre dreadful and dispitous
Began atwene Pompeye and caesar Julius
Thus when the seid famous scipion
Was through my favor acounted most notable
He fro my whele suddenly was throw down
Which never in word nor deed was culpable
But the romans malicious and unstable
By their hangman first cheyned in prison
After racked there geyned no raunson
Thus he that had auayled them so often
To save him silf fond socoure on no side
His deed body they henge it hye aloft
For a spectacle long there to abide
Thus gerisshly my giftys I dyuyde
Stoundmele now friend now aduersarye
Reward good with guyrdons full contrary
This was expert full well in scipion
Began with Joy and endyd in wretchydnesse
Bochas remember make hereof mention
And of fanatichus how I of gentylnesse
Made him affende to notable hye prowess
Yet books sey touching his kinrede
Manly of person a churl borne in deed
For my desporte with a glad visage
I set him up full hye upon my whele
Gave him lordship out of low seruage
To do him favor it lyked me full well
Wherefore bochas his storye every dele
Note it well and in especial
How he by sleight came to estate royal
By sleighty feynynge to diverse folk he told
How that he spoke with scirra the goddess
At every hour pleynly when he would
Of presumpcion descryued her likeness
Seyde also how she of her goodness
Had granted him his state to magnefye
During his life a spirit of prophesye
And forthermore the people for to blind
He fantasied by a craft uncouth
Within a shale the storye makes mind
Of a notte to have fire in his mouth
Blewe it sparklinge north and south
Affermyd wherewith folk were blente
It was a spyryte to him from heuyn sent
By which he wrought many great virtue
Gadred people till he had in deed
Two thousand churles at his retynue
Which afterward his purpose for to speed
To sixty thousand encreced as I read
I suffered all served him at the tide
Till all the court grutchyd at his pride
Though of birth he was but a vyleyne
Roos up of naught by sodeyne adventure
My gery favor made him to be seyne
Royal of port did his besy cure
To reyse his banere ware a cote armure
And by gracious supportacion
Brought great people to his subjection
At the taste my lust began appall
Toward him not being favor
Down fro my whele anon I made him fall
For by romans was sent a great constable
Called porpenna a prince full notable
Which fill on him venquesshyd him anon
Slough and outrayed his churles euerychon
Him silf was hanged upon an hye gibet
Su^me of his meny was cast in prison
Thus to his pride I gave a great tripet
And fro my whele I cast him low down
In his most highest domynacion
Took none head where he did laugh or mourn
For with noman I do alwey soiourne
Bochas quod fortune take good head also
How I can both further and disauayle
For exaumple se how athenyo
That whilom was a sheperd in Itayle
A brygaunt after marchauntys to assail
Lay in awayte beside a great mounteyne
Of fugetyues he was made a capteyne
Slough first his lord a rich Senatoure
By violence brake many a strong prison
And for a time I gave him great favor
To gadre robbours about him enuiron
All the churlys of that region
He assemblyd through his Iniquite
To hold a werre with rome the cite
Beseged castelles brake down mighty toures
Slough and robbed about in each cuntre
Spoiled paleys of worthy Senatoures
Title had he none sauf title of volunte
Took upon him of pride and cruelte
For to be clad in purple like a king
Bare a scepter among his men ridynge
Upon his head ordeynyd for the nonys
His gold here tressyd like an emperor
A coyf enbrouded all of rich stones
Me list to laugh that a falls robbour
By supportacion of my gery favor
Which taste not long for after in short while
As is my custom I did him begyle
I suffered him made him feyned chere
As I have to other mo done full often
Till down fro rome was sent a consulere
Which took him proudly and henge alofte
His churles slain and su^me of them not soft
In cheynes bound for short conclusion
Were dempt by law to dye in prison
By which storye bochas thou may lere
A great party of my condition
But now in have a story thou shall here
How in the year for the fundacion
More tha^ sixt^ hundred I mean of rome town
Was agaderinge a great cumpanye
Togedre sworn by falls conspiracye
Them to withdraw fro the presence
Of a tribune called Lodonce
Which for knighthode had governance
And was sent down from rome cite
With mighty hand to rule a great cuntre
Called chaumpayne and pleynly for to seye
The people there list him not obey
This score and four were of them in noumbre
That named were cheef conspyratours
Which that cast them their capteyn to encoumbre
With multitude of theuys and robbours
Which chase among them to be their supportours
(...) mighty capteyns of which there was one
Called spartharchus chefest of echon
Gadred churles made them silf strong
On an hye hill took their dwelling place
Having no reward were it right or wrong
To spoil the cuntre bestys to enchace
I cherisshed them with a benign face
For a ceson and gave them liberte
By falls rauyne to rob the cuntre
What thing more cruel in comparison
And more vengeable of will and not of right
Than when a chorle has domynacion
Lak of discrecion blinds so the sight
Of co^muners for defaute of light
When they have power cuntrees to govern
Fare like a best can nothing discern
Gladiatores folkys did them call
For their swerdys were with steel made fine
For to fight geyn wild bestys all
As lions beerys bores wild swyne
And the mounteyne where they did line
Called venuse and through their cruelte
Slough and robbyd about in each cuntre
Spartharchus was their cheef capteyne
Brought up naught and borne of low degree
But Claudius a mighty strong romayn
Was sent with power fro rome the cite
For to diffende and save the cuntre
The hill besegynge before them as he lay
He was rebuked beat and driven away
Many of them that kept the mounteyne
Were hurt that day the storye tells thus
Among which was slain a great capteyne
That was felawe unto Spartharchus
As I find he hight ynomaus
For whoos death was take so great vengeance
That all the cuntre felt thereof greuaunce
They of the mounteyne all of one assent
Without mercy or remission
Most vengeable have robbyd and brent
All the cuntre about them enuyron
Till two consulers fro rome down
The first of them called lentulus
Both put to flight the seid spartharchus
Whereof the romans greatly dismayed
The Senators of indignacion
Both asshamed and in them silf affrayed
Sent one crassus a great lord of the town
With the noumbre of a Legion
And when that he on Spartharchus first set
Slough of his men six thousand when they met
And afterward beside a great riuere
Called Salaire they had a great battle
Where Spartharchus stood in great daungere
For his chere and countenance began fail
Thretty thousand clad in plate and mayle
Were slain that day there geyned no raunson
All their capteyns assigned to prison
Without all this as made is mention
Sixty thousand in the field lay deed
And six thousand were sent to prison
The feeld with blood steyned and made red
And four thousand quakynge in their dread
Were thilke day after the romans guyse
Take to mercy received to fraunchise
And Spartharchus at myscheef put to flight
When I from him turned my visage
He lost chere he lost also his might
When I appalled the fine of his passage
And for he was a churl of his lynage
Of his encres I lyked no thing well
Therefore unwarily I cast him fro my whele
Of manerys to make a gretter preef
There was another famous great robboure
Which through Spain was a disclaundryd thief
And for he dred of justice the rigor
Trusting he should find in me socoure
Called vrinatus he spain anon forsook
And to rome the right wey he took
Gadred meyne of his condition
Of every sect to make him silf strong
Theuys robboures of every region
Many a churl was meddled them among
His name to encres were it right or wrong
What ever he gat in cite or village
With his soudyours he parted the pyllage
Thus by mine help he came to gre richesse
Which brought in pride and presumpcion
He not provided of my doubleness
Began to malign ageyn rome town
But by the prudence of last Scipion
Son of ^epidus making thereof no boost
He sleyn was by them he trusted most
By which exaumple notable of remembrance
Showed here tofore John bochas unto the
Thou may know in party my puissaunce
My sodeyn chaungis my mutabylite
And for to avoid all ambyguite
To declare the su^me of mine intent
Great marrius to the I do present
Blak his wede and his habyte also
His head unkempt his locks hor and gray
His look down cast in tokne of sorrow and woe
On his chekys the salt terys lay
Which bare record of his dedly affray
Wherefore bochas do thy pen dress
So descryue his mortal heaviness
His robe steyned was with romayne blood
His sword ay ready whet to do vengeance
Like a tyrant most furious and wode
In slaughtre and murdre set all his plesaunce
Yet not for thy I gave him governance
Over the people roos on my whele up fast
But as unwarily down I did him cast
Twene him and scilla the woeful dedly stryues
At large herafter bochas thou shall write
How many romans lost by them their lives
I will also in order that thou endite
And if I shall rebuke them and atwyte
As I fro naught made them in honor shine
So I ageynwarde made them in mischeef fine
Forgetnat also the dedly pitous fate
Of him that was so notable in his life
I mean the great famous metridate
Whoos name is yet full ^outh and rife
To whom I gave a great prerogatife
Forty winter the deed was well seen
Ageyn romans the werre to sustene
For which herafter I give it the in charge
Of Metridate the story set alonge
When thou haste leyser and a space large
Remember his conquest and his dedys strong
And how that I medlyd me among
For all his noblesse and his felicite
To give him part of great aduersite
Next in order after her own chois
Fortune untrusty upon each party
To John bochas has conveyed fro parthoys
Strong Herodes regnynge in parthye
Loo John quod she take heed of this storye
All his kinrede if it be well out sought
Were by Scithyens chasyd and brought to naught
And yet for all my mutabylyte
Su^me of them which they stood despeyred
I restored unto their dignite
Unto which when they were repeyred
This herodes was hyndred and appeyred
By chaunges for his hateful pride
When he leest wend unwarily set aside
Suynge after within a little while
This gerissh lady of condition
Began an ill laughing falsely for to smyle
Lokynge on bochas brought with her down
Amighty prince which in rome town
Had in his days notable pris and fame
Albe that she oppressed not his name
Bochas than his head began down declyne
Seeing that prince of face disfigured
Of susspection began to ymagyne
When he his mind fully has recured
By certain toknys and signs well assured
It was pompeie surquedous of estate
Which with Caesar so long was at debate
Disconsolate through his unhappy caas
His face soyled with water of the se
Time when fostynus and cruel achi^las
Drownyd his body of furious enmyte
His face disfigured at the solempnyte
With smokys blake dedly and mortal
Called of clerks the feast funeral
Codrus caused the corpse was brent
And consumed in to ashes deed
To caesar after his head was borne and sent
Upon o pole his storye who list read
After all this bochas took good head
^owe fortune by a manner mockerye
In s^orne of him began thus to specefie
Upon the heuene after his deuys
I began enhaunce and encrece his glory
By my favor I gave him many a prys
Conquest of kings with many great victory
And more to put his nobles in memory
By my supporte through his chiualrye
With caesar Julius to hold chaumpartye
And while that I my favor did apply
Toward him his victoryes to assure
His fame aroos till that in Thesalie
I began withdraw his party to socoure
Suffringe his enmyes make disconfiture
Upon this pompeye hindered in my sight
When to Lesbos at mischeef took his flight
By the servants of young tholome
Regnynge in egypt pompeye in his dread
Was take and slain he fond no help in me
I gave him up and so he lost his head
Yet of my chaunges noman takes head
Nor how vnsuerly I cast my dredefull look
Save thou art besy to set them in thy book
Bochas astoned percell of her presence
Both of chere face and countenance
And this while having his aduertence
Thought he saw a manner resemblaunce
Of a person which stood in great greuaunce
Till at last fortune cast her sight
Toward bochas and told what he hight
This is quod she pleynly to termyne
The famous man prince of eloquence
That gave to latynes the scole and the doctrine
Of rethoryk as well of that science
For which I will thou do thy diligence
To write with other of this tullyus
All the case and gyn at marrius
These wordys seyde fortune made an end
She beat her wings and took her to the flight
I cannat se what way she did wend
Save Bochas tells like an angel bright
At her departinge she showed a great light
But as soon as she began disapere
He took his pen wrote as ye shall here
How Gayus Marryus of low birth borne ca^ to hye estate / which blent with
couetise after many great batayles dyed at myscheef
HEre bochas gynneth to tell of the man
Called in his time Gayus marrius
Borne at aprina a castle of tuscan
Son of a Carpentere the story tells thus
Pursued armies manly and virtuous
Through all rome nor in that cuntre
Was there no man hold so strong as he
Dysciplyne and great subtylte
He had also as bokys specefye
Prudence manhood and habylyte
Both in arms and in chiualrye
Most famous hold toward the pertye
Within a while mine auctoure seith certain
Chose a tribune and a great capteyne
But fro the gynnynge of his tender age
As Istoryes put in remembrance
He was pricked so sore in his courage
By a gredy fret of long contynuaunce
Never to staunch with none habundaunce
The world nor fortune with all their great richesse
Suffysed not to appese his gredynesse
Entringe a temple he fond a deuynour
Counsayled there by his dyuynaile
Tentre rome and hold their soiour
By good auys and knightly apparayle
Made him promys that he shall not fail
Tatteyne by favor of the comonte
To great office and state in the cite
Favor of commons brought him to hye estate
By them received unto the dignyte
Of consulere albe that the Senate
Had disdeyne of his felicite
Because he was borne of low degree
Grauntyd to him after by the town
To conquer realmys by a co^missyon
He gate the province through his hye renoun
Of Numedie as he did them assail
And took the king of that region
Called Iugurta proudly in battle
For which empryse by marciall apparayle
He gate the triumph through the town riding
Because only for taking of that king
And for he was a person so notable
For many famous sodeyn great victory
Namely in conquest preued profitable
To all the common as put is in memory
And for thencres of his renoun and glory
By thoppynion hole of the cite
In his hand lay all their prosperity
Again a people that called was Lembroys
Them to conquer from rome he was sent down
Also ageyn the boystous tigurnoys
Gadred to gydre of many nation
All them he brought to subjection
Like as romans had before desired
Because they had ageyn their town conspired
They took upon them of falls presumpcion
To pass all the mounteynes of Itayle
First disconfited as made is mention
Three romayn dukes felly in battle
Four score thousand clad in plate and mayle
Slain of romans the story is well know
Under thalpies at myscheef overthrow
This marrius of marciall adventure
In germanye had a great battle
With Tewtobochus a geaunt of stature
Put first to flight with all his apparayle
For marrius did him so sore assail
At the chas proudly borne to ground
Maugre his might take and in cheynes bound
Marrius after with his host him drough
Toward the people of cunbrois for to fight
Two hundred people I find of them he slough
Eight thousand take three thousand put to flight
King bolerus a full famous knight
Slain in the field for all his great pride
Again marius like as he did ride
That day of Cymbroyes was all the people slain
The wymen after he list not to reserve
Yet they profryd and would have been full feign
Their chastity devoutly to observe
In the temple of vesta for to serve
But their request for he list not here
With him they faught echon slain I fere
Except su^me when they saw none other
Remedy of purpoos they were set
Euerich of them to sle and murdre other
And su^me thought also it was bet
To hang them silf upon an hye gibet
Than to abide of marrius the outrage
Perpetuelly to live in seruage
Thus marrius of three nations
Through his conquest complisshed the victory
With prisoners of sundry regions
Entryd rome to his encres of glory
With special laudys notable of memory
First the triumph a guyrdon singulere
He times six was chose a consulere
Thus fortune was to him favorable
To set him up in wordly dignitees
For a ceson but for he was chaungeable
Among her gifts and great prosperitees
She gave him part of great aduersitees
And specially the time accoumpted than
Twene him and scilla when the werre began
Lucius scilla abiding in chaumpeyne
Marrius at rome tho present
When the division began atwene them twain
Each to other contrary of entente
Malencolious and impaciente
Which of both thestory well conceived
To gou^rne should sonest be received
All suddenly where it were right or wrong
Toward rome taking his passage
Ageyn marrius to make him silf strong
Began sle and bren ne and of great outrage
Wylfull hasty furious of courage
For sodeyne coming and unware violence
Ageyn him fond no resistance
Two mighty batayles he did with him led
Entringe the cite began through the wall mine
With one battle fast began him speed
To pass the gate called aquylyne
That other gate named was Colyne
At whoos entering by record of the book
Scilla by strength the capitoyle took
But when marrius had knowlegynge
That Scilla had so great power and might
Without a rest or longer abiding
In to a marys gayus anon right
With all his people took suddenly his flight
Fit out by strength could him not diffende
Scilla after to prison did him send
Thus the prowess for a while slept
Of marrius lyinge in prison
Scilla that time the capytoyle kept
Whereby all rome stood in subjection
And of hatrede in haste he sent down
A sturdy chorle to marrius in his dread
While he lay bound to smite of his hode
This chorle well compact of braune and of bonys
Set of purpose marrius for to oppress
For his strength ordained for the nonys
To the prison the churl began fast him dress
Where marrius was fettred in distress
Fully in purpose without more delay
To behede him in prison there he lay
Losinge him first lyinge on his couch
And marrius rose up like a man
The chorle feerfull to smyt or to touch
And marrius full proudly tho began
To enter a place beside of a woman
Found an ass there of adventure
Upon whoos back the se he began recure
Toward affrik there he fond passage
By ^nprysonynge though he were wexe feynt
Yet there abode still in his courage
Hye worthynes with prudence meynt
Which in his person were not ^ueynt
Again the malice to make a countertayle
Of proud Scilla the malice eft tassayle
Of Itayle rode through the cuntre
Took his viage through rome town
With four bateyles entered the cite
Six hundred knights by computacion
Slain in the feelde as made is mention
Where men may se who lift look aferre
What damage diuysion does in werre
First by the manhood of this marrius
In this division the story who list read
The great consul called octauius
Lost his head and his life in deed
Upon a pole which it did blede
Was cruelly presentyd of intent
Tofore the Iuges sitting in judgment
Of whoos death su^me of them were fayn
Su^me sorry of love as they were bound
And in this werre merula was slain
Priest in the temple like as it is found
Of Jupiter with many mortal wound
The romayn slain that called was crassus
With fire consumed was proud catulus
All his enmyes marrius did encoumbre
Which again him by conspiracyon
Were assented with a full great noumbre
In their auyse for to have put him down
Take from him his domynacion
But he abode the turment and the shoures
Strong to condemn all his conspiratours
Syx times aforne rehearsed here
Of condition though he were desp^tous
He was chosyn so often consulere
Till fortune began wex enuyous
Ageyn this seid cruel marrius
Which made the Senate with all the chyualrye
To g^^tch again his hateful tyranny
In this time the story makes mind
Damasippus a pr^tor of the town
Friendly to marryus and helping as I find
Under a shadow of decepcion
Unto their cite for to do treson
Causynge four romans come in ^^re
Tofore marrius a certain day to appear
And their names to put in memory
Sceuola carto and Domycyus
The fourth of them as seith the story
Called in rome the wise antistius
Togedre assembled tofore marrius
He of rancoure again judgment or law
Made them be slain and through the cite draw
Their bodies after were in tybre cast
By cruelte of the said marrius
All this while the cruel werre last
Twene him and scilla till duke campanyus
Came to the party hardy and dispytous
To help Scilla their baners first displayed
Whereof all rome was suddenly affrayed
At gate that called was collyne
Marry and scilla had a great battle
Four score thousand the noumbre to termyne
On marrius side slain it is no fail
Scilla victorious with marciall apparayle
Entering the town ageyn his oath parde
Three thousand citesyns slough at that cite
Of folk disarmyd and nakyd in the town
They nouther spared old nor young of age
The cruel murdres walking up and down
By Scilla sent in that mortal rage
Till Cattallus a prince fall in age
Seide unto scilla we can no difference
Twene rebellion nor atwene Innocence
We murdre and sle without excepcion
Both hye and low holding no manner
Ageyn all knighthode to mine oppinyon
We do proceed in our conquest here
Our title is lost the triumph to requere
Of hye prowess when we can not observe
No difference to sle nor to reserve
And in this while of hateful cruelte
Scilla contreuyd lettres diffamable
Whereby five hundryd out of that cite
Were falsely banisshed citesyns notable
Ageyns them he was so vntretable
All their godys achetyd in that rage
Of avarice and of falls pillage
Another romayne named marrius
Brother to marrius of whom tofore I told
For dread of Scilla fled and took an house
Which unto got was set up for a fold
Found and rent out in his days old
With cords draw no rescus might him save
Of cruel vengeance to catallus grave
Where scilla made by cruel Judgment
With a sharp sword forgyd for to byte
After time his iyen were out rent
Both at onys his hands of to smite
His head of smet no raunson might him quyte
Set on a pole it would be none other
And of despite sent unto his brother
To great marrius of whom I spoke now right
The great duke so mighty and so huge
Which had before take him to the flight
For fere of scilla in that mortal deluge
In to a cite to find there refuge
Called preueste there stondynge in great dread
Namely when he beheld his brothers head
For as much as he no socoure fond
Disespeyred this was his purpos
To sle him silf with his own hand
In thylke place where he was kept clos
Drew out a sword and up anon aros
Constreyned his servant in that soden affray
Smite of his head the silf same day
Men sey how death is fine of all myscheef
End of aduersite that does wretchys tarry
Fortune here makes another preef
In marrius how she her course began vary
By an euydence hateful and contrary
To show her malice and vngoodliheded
Ageyn this duke alas when he was deed
This froward lady of malice most vengeable
When her list furiously to rave
And show her silf cruel and unstable
To none estate she list no reward have
Caused marrius be take out of his grave
By cruel scilla in story it is found
His ougly careyn smet on pecys round
And after more to show his cruelte
Marrius should have no burienge place
Cast his careyn of cankryd enmyte
Into tybre there was none other grace
Loo thus can fortune for her folk purchase
By which exaumple touching marrius
Of wordly chaunges bochas writes thus
Makes in this chaptre a descrypcion
First what thing is very gentylnesse
To set a preef and a probacion
Nothing atteyneth unto hye noblesse
But the clear shynynge of virtuous clennesse
Which may not show in hye nor low parage
But where it grows out of a pure courage
Worldly powere oppression tyranny
Erthely tresour gold stonys nor richesse
Be no menys unto gentrye
But if virtue rule their hye prowess
For where vices have interesse
In hye birth mean or low kinrede
Deem no man gentle but only by his deed
In royal palasis of stone and metal wrought
With galaryes or statly ^loistres round
Gentylnesse nor noblesse is not sought
Nor in selers nor in voughtys round
But only there where virtue does habounde
Corious clothes nor great possessions
Makes not a man gentle but conditions
Philosophers conclude in their intent
And all these worthy famous old auctours
Noman may queth in his testament
Gentylnesse unto his s^^^ssours
Of wicked wede come none holsum flowers
Concludynge thus of good men and of shrewys
Call each man gentle after his good thewys
Duke marrius of whom I spak toforne
Of nature the story bears witness
As by descent pore and nedy borne
By disposicion of coragious noblesse
Had in his person wit strength hardynesse
Under all this there did his heart mine
A worm of avarice his worship to declyne
What vayleth plente that never may suffyse
Or what the flode that stauncheth no thurst
Or what an appetyte which ever does arise
All way to ete and ever to ete has lust
Of cankred hungre so fretynge is the ruste
That the river of tantalus in his rage
Of gredy etikys the fret may not assuage
Of marrius ye have herd the end
His woofull fall and his unhappy cas
In to fate how he did wend
Now will I follow mine auctour John bochas
How unto him three cleopatras
With look down cast woeful face and chere
All at onys did to him appear
The first of them by process of writynge
Had three husbondys bochas does express
Weddyd in youth to alisaundre the king
Called zebenna a prince of great noblesse
After that for her great fayrnesse
She weddyd was unto demetrius
And last of all to king antiochus
Of her three husbondys woeful adventure
And of her sonnys great unkindness
Bochas before has done his besy cure
Ceriously the manner to express
Which to reherce ageyn were Idleness
Since all the process here tofore is found
Of the first and eke of the secounde
Which weddyd was to king tholome
Like as a fore eke made is mention
Both of their joy and their aduersite
The first slain by drinking of poison
And the second to her confusion
By euergetes were she woe orfeyn
Was with her child served that was sleyn
The thryd weddyd was to king Grispus
Slain in a temple by full great outrage
For dread and shame began wexe furious
To save her silf knew none advantage
Save she enbracyd of Jupiter an Image
In the story as here tofore is found
Or she was deed suffered many a wound
How king metrydate boode vii year in wilderness had great turmentys both
on see and land / by his blood brought to vntraunce slough him silfe with a
sword.
i will pass over these cleopatras three
Forth proceed to the hasty fate
Sone execute by percas cruelte
Upon the duke called metrydate
First reherce the great unkindly hate
Of them that were his tutours as I read
Him to destroy by assent of his kinrede
Which of purpos did his death provide
By many uncouth strange occasion
In tender youth first they made him ride
Upon an horse wylder than a lion
Of purpos only for his destruction
But albe so that he was young of age
The horse he ruled in all his most rage
Not of doctrine but only of nature
He was disposed cu^nyngly to ride
Over him the maystry to recure
Maugre the horse of wit he was his guide
What way he took froward or aside
He dauntyd him that where so ever he rode
Brydlyd him and on his bak he bode
His own kyn and his next alyes
Most labored to bring him to mischeef
With venymous drink set on him espyes
At good leiser as does a covert thief
Of their fell poison for to make a preef
In their intent this is well couth
Him to murdre in his tender youth
But when that he apperceyued their treson
To save him silf made great ordinance
Anon as he began have suspecion
Of their unkindly hateful purueaunce
For remedies made cheuysaunce
Was provided their malice to declyne
By many notable prouyd medecyne
And their malice prudently to eschew
Is remembered while he was young of age
With certain frendys which that did him sue
He disposed of custum his courage
To hunte and chase beestys most savage
Under that color he did it for a wyle
Far fro his cuntre absente him for awhile
Of one courage one heart and one chere
Suffered manly took none heaviness
In desertys space of seuene year
Among hye hyllys bode in wyldrenesse
Set in asia the storye berith witness
Fond no lodging trasynge the cuntrees
Save in kauernys and great holowe trees
The book remembers how that his dyete
Were beestys wild enchaced with great might
Fled Idelnesse eschued all quiet
And yltyll sleep suffised him at night
By exercise his body was made light
There was nouther when him list pursue
Heart nor hynde that might his hand eschew
He nouther drad tygres nor lions
He was so swyst though they did him assail
Like of strength to old champions
No wild best of great nor small entrayle
To escape his hand might not countreuayle
If he were ware erly outher late
So great swyftnesse had ^^tridate
Among he had in armies exercise
Among to tournay and ren on horsbacke
All delycate fare he did also despise
Of gredy excess in him there was no lak
A nightertyme his sleep full often he brake
Stoundemele the hours for to mark
In the dawning ros up or the lark
The space accomplisshed fully of seuene year
He is repaired home to his cuntre
Showed him silf of manhood and of chere
Full like a knight his story who list se
Whereof his enmyes astonyed be
Caught of his cu^mynge in heart a manner dread
Supposing before that he was deed
In whoos absence his wif leodices
Conveyed a child as made is mention
For the diffame should not cu^me in prees
Him for to murdre she sought occasion
Fully in purpos to sle him by poison
Of which diffautys her lord was no thing feign
Knowing the troth made her to be slain
Took on him after many knightly deed
First to conquer all Pafflogonye
By the help of worthy Nychomede
That time called king of bythynye
Togydre assured to be of one alye
In loss or lucre fortune to be their guide
And thereto sworn never to deuyde
To metridate legates were down sent
Fro the romans him lowly requeringe
That he would like to their intent
Pafflogonye restore to their king
Which he had won the cite assaylyng
But he list not aduertyse their prayere
Nor on no pertyes their requestys here
He dred not their thretys nor manacys
Gate proudly after the land of Galathye
In his conquestys wan many other ^lacys
Capadoce took to his party
Slough their king of hatrede and envy
Ariarectes a full manly man
And in this wise his conquest he began
Ageyn thassuraunce twene him and nichomede
All suddenly he began fall at debate
Thought he would warreye him in deed
Because that he pompous and ^late
In capadoce took on him thestate
To regne as king ageyns his intent
He nouther being of counseyle nor assent
Yet nichomede or they began debate
Had long before to his own encres
The suster weddyd of that Metridate
When they as brethren lyuyd in rest and pes
And she also was called leodyces
Having two sonnys borne for to succeed
After disses of seyde Nychomede
And by process these seyde children tweyne
In capadoce by help of metridate
Cleymed a title justly for to atteyne
Unto the crown their fader dyed but late
For which they began felly to debate
Till metridate falsely began contriue
His two neuewes ungoodly to deprive
All Capadoce he took into his hand
His own son he has crownyd king
Capadociens by assente of all the land
Began disobeye of purpose his werkynge
When the romans considred all this thing
A^^obarzenes in have they sent down
Geyn metridate to keep that region
The son of whom fro them they have refused
Out of their kingdom began him to enchace
For they sempt their fraunchise was abused
To se a foreyn occupye that place
Metridate began newely them manace
And took with them to sustain his pertye
Tygranes the king of armenye
Arriobarzenes that was fro rome sent
To capadoce to help them and counsel
Of metridate knowing the intent
How he came down proudly him tassayle
With digranes set in the first battle
Of capadoce that all the region
Was brought that day to their subjection
Thus metridate heuynge his intent
In short time cuntres conquerynge
Was mightyest prince of all the orient
And in tho days one the grettest king
And as it is remembryd by writing
He delyted most in astronomye
In sortilege and in sorcerye
And with all these he did his besy cure
For to learn uncouth conclusions
And secretys sought out by nature
Knew the langages of diverse regions
Of two and twenty sundry nations
And held wymen many more than one
Loved hipsicrata above them euerichone
To the romans this manly metridate
As books old record of him and said
Upon a day of very cruel hate
Through all as^e he bad that each romayne
Should of his men mercyles be slain
Twenty thousand he slough eke on a day
Of romayn marchauntys durst no man sey nay
To him he drough diverse nations
To encres his party by puissaunce
Kymbroys Gallois with other regions
Bostornois took to his alliance
With strange people made his acqueintaunce
Where that ever he rode nigh or far
With them of rome for to hold werre
In greece also he gate many an isle
All ^^clades to his subjection
Conquered so that within a while
Of athenys he gate the famous town
But when romans knew his entencion
They sent scilla in a furious hete
With metridate in greece for to mete
Achelaus which that was cunstable
Ledynge the ost of king metridate
Began ageyn scilla trusting he was able
Maugre romans with him to debate
As they met in their furious hate
Beside Orthonya of greece a great town
Of achelaus the party was brought down
There began Scilla to be victorious
Geyne metridate and by great violence
Gate all ephese a kingdom full famous
Rode through asie fond no resistance
By his knighthode and manly prouydence
Capadoce Bithynye eke also
To romayn hands he gate them both two
When metridate perceived has this thing
How the conquest of Scilla took encres
Anon he cast without long taryinge
For a time with him to have a pes
Of hye wysdom he was not recheles
To dissymule till he fond time and space
In fortune to find better grace
Abode his time kept him silf clos
Till he fond leyser like his opinyon
In this while of adventure aros
Within rome a great discencion
Twene two consulers being in that town
Which to appesse by his auctoryte
Scilla came up again to the cite
When Metridate his absence did espy
To his purpos found oportunyte
Gadred people and with his chiualrye
A siege laid unto Cyzite the cite
Of all asye most of auctoryte
Till Lucullus a mighty consulere
To break the syege aproch began full nere
Metridate had on five capteyns
Tofore the town made a disconfiture
Of hye despyte he had to romans
But Lucullus the damages to recure
Tenclose his enemies did his besy cure
To his mynours gave anon in charge
About the syege to make a dych full large
They within had knowlegynge
By certain toknes of all their governance
Whereupon they made a tariynge
To cast away for their delyueraunce
Metridate seeing their ordinance
Of hye prudence escapyd awey beside
And at the sige list no longer abide
Lucullus than the mighty consulere
Pursued after slough of his meyne
Such multitude that Asopus the ryuere
Was made with blood like the read se
With wind and tempest fordryue^ also was he
And when he saw no socoure in the land
To ship he went with strong and mighty hand
He fond fortune cruel aduersarye
On land and se this worthy metridate
And neptunus made the se contrary
Ageyns him his puissaunce tabate
What shall men call it influence or fate
So suddenly a prince of hye renoun
Fro hye noblesse to be plonged down
For any myscheef he kept ay one visage
This metridate and loath was for to plye
Or for to bow so strong was his courage
But eft ageyn goth with his chiualrye
Toward adastrus an hill of armenye
Where as pompeye beset him enuyron
Sent fro rome to his destruction
Metridate making his lodging place
Under that hill when it drew to night
The troubly heuene with thundringe began manace
The fyry leuyn dyrkyd has his sight
The cloudy moan eclipsyd of her light
Astonyed him by unware violence
That he stood confus of all providence
He was by tempest and unware dyrknesse
Almost made weary of his woeful life
Yet I find of very kindness
Hipsitraca which that was his wif
Nouther for werre nor no mortal stryf
Left him never disgysed of visage
Followed him arrayed as a page
Yet in his most mortal heaviness
When cloudy fortune began him most manace
Of his courage the natural quiknesse
Appalled not nor remeuyd from his place
So hye prowess did his heart enbrace
Not dispeyred for no soden fall
Of condition he was so marciall
In tokne whereof he stondinge at myscheef
Changed nouther chere nor countenance
An evidence and a full great preef
Of manly force and hertly assurance
Defiynge fortune with all her variaunce
When that he fond to his destruction
Of disespeyre grettest occasion
With him he had a balyf as I find
Called Castor which of condition
Was to his lord falls and eke unkind
And conspired ageyn him falls treson
In tokne whereof up to rome town
His lordys children young and tender of age
Like a thef he sent them in hostage
One of his sonnys he murdered by treson
Which metridate took full fore at heart
Another son as made is mention
Falls to his fadre which when he did aduerte
The unkindness made him sore smerte
For of all vices shortly to conclude
Worst of all is Ingratitude
This same child of whom I make mind
Called pharnax which ageyn nature
To his fader traitor and unkind
And his purpos again him to recure
In all haste did his besy cure
For to accomplyssh his purpos in party
Drough to him hole his saders chyualrye
By sleight and mede when he was made strong
H^ besegyd his fadre round about
Unto nature me seems he did wrong
To put his fader in so great adoute
Kyndnesse was fer shet without
When the son with hate set afyre
Ageyn his fadre list falsely to conspyre
With multitude his fader was constreyned
Maugre his might into a toure to fle
His son unkind has at him disdeyned
And yet for all his strange aduersite
Of his courage the magnanymyte
In his psone stood hole list not varye
Though fortune was to him contrary
Yet mine auctour bochas berith record
That metridate if it would have be
Requeryd his son to be at acorde
And set aside all old contrariouste
But he unkind indurat was parde
Ever froward malicious of courage
So disposed from his tender age
So that the king metridate alas
Was ouercu^me by unkindness
That never before in nomaner cas
Stood dismayed but of hye prowess
Kept ay one face all passions to repress
This virtue force by marciall doctrine
For none aduersite suffered him declyne
End of his werrys and his mortal stryues
Of his debates and discencions
His concubynes his daughters and his wives
By mean only of certain pocions
Slough them all by drynkinge of poisons
For he not would the cause to descryue
After his death they should bide on live
His own death of mortal fell rigor
Compassed before thus he began deuyse
Made a french knight that was a soudiour
With a sharp sword in full cruel wise
To run him through whereby the fraunchise
Conserved was his purpos to fulfill
He would not dye but by his own will
Lo here the end of king metridate
Late princys all of his death take heed
How rechelesly he passed into fate
And by assent made his heart blede
And bochas here who list his book to read
Pleynly rehersinge but in wordys few
To wordly princys does his conceit show
Lenuoye.
MIghty princys lift up your corages
Toward heuene do your hertys dress
Of your memou^ turn up the visages
Where joy is ever pes concord and gladness

Of blody werrys impossible to repress

Rekne up princys that sat hye on stagys
What was the fine of their royal noblesse
Or of tyrauntes rekne up the blody wagis
Soden slaughter guyrdoned their wodnesse

By blood unkind brought unto ^ttraunce
Through soden change of worldly variauce
Princis remember upon the golden ages
When Saturn ruled the world in rightwysnesse
Next Jupiter for peplys advantage
The sylueren world conserved in clennesse
Which mars has now turned to felnesse
Made it steelen with sword dagger and lance
Through sodeyn change of wordly variaunce
Of Metridate regestre the viages

How Encratydes king of Sithye was slain by Demetry^s: and after his careyn
cast to hound^s
NExt in order to bochas did apere
A woeful prince that put him silf in pres
Regnynge in Sithia his story does us lere
The name of whom was Encratides
But to dysturbe his quiet and his pes
Ageyn him pleynly as I find
Came demetrius the mighty king of^ynde
Of whom the power and the violence
To Encratydes was very importable
Besyegyd first and for lack of diffence
Take at myscheef his fone not mercyable
For demetrius was on him so vengeable
When he was slain within his own bounds
Made the careyn be cast out to the hounds
Not withstanding he was a worthy king
Born of hye blood such was his adventure
Demetrius sone above all erthly thing
Hatyd him by record of scripture
Of rancoure denied his sepulture
And for the matter is hateful and contrary
On his storye I will no lengre tarry
How Herodes king of Parthos werred with Romans: which after his son and
heir was slain: made his bastard son king: That anon after slough his
fader
tO Arthanabus whilom of parthos king
I purpos my style to transporte
A full old prince had in his living
Sons tweyne books so report
Which in his age did him most confort
Metridate was the eldest brother
And Herodes called was that other
Metridate by reason of his age
His fader deed did after him succeed
Which banysshed was for tyranny and outrage
Afterward for mischef and for need
In to babylon he took his flight for dread
The people anon after his partynge
Of Indignacion made his brother king
Thus came herodes to estate royal
Pursued his brodre in to babylon
Leyde a siege round about the wall
They to him yeldyd up the town
Thus was his brother brought to confusion
Before the castle without lengre date
Made smite of the head of metrydate
In parthos after he took possession
Thus young herodes of volunte and pride
Began a werre ageyn them of rome town
Whom to withstand they list not long abide
The consul Crassus came down to their side
Commanded was short process for to make
Toward parthois his viage for to ta^e
Crassus list not tentre in that reame
Left parthos the story does deuyse
Took his way toward Jerusalem
To take there a solemn empryse
In the temple only of couetise
Took there again the title of rightwisnesse
Up all their tresour and their great richesse
By which he gate in diverse regions
Great multitude to hold up his pertye
Led with him eleuene legions
Toward parthoys fast began him hye
By his lettres proudly began diffye
The seide Herodes and with great apparayle
Myd his cuntre profryd him battle
The next morrow when crassus took the field
To him was brought of black a cote a^mure
Which when his knightis auisely beheld
Dempt it a tokne of disconfiture
For in contraire romans do their cure
When their capteyn shall feight or the head
His cote armure is outher white or read
A Another tokne froward to behold
The first Egle beat in his banere
Also sone as men did it unfold
Contrariously he turnyd look and chere
The bak to Cras^us folk saw that stood nere
A pronostyk to romans full certain
How fortune to them was that day again
By the flode passing of Eustrates
With unware tempests his standardis euerichone
In to the ryuere were cast among the prees
To rekne them all upright stood not one
Whereof astonyed they would no ferther gone
These pronostikes made them so afraid
Like men in heart dispeyred and dismayed
Of these toknes crassus was recheles
The pronostikes also he did despise
Took upon him to pass Eufrates
To enter parthoys only for couetyse
To whom herodes sends in this ^ase
That his coming was more for pillage
Than for knighthode manhood or courage
All the power of parthoys tho came down
With many prefect and many great cunstable
Again crassus and them of rome town
Which as I told abode on their pillage
That turned after to their great damage
The son of Crassus slain in that fray
His fader take and all upon a day
His hedesmyt of in whom was no diffence
And disconfyted with many legion
The head of crassus brought to the presence
Of herodes within his royal town
Which has commanded gold to be brought down
To be molte there as he lay deed
And to pour thereof full his head
This thing was done for a mockerye
In sign only the storye does deuyse
That gold nor tresour upon no party
Staunche might his thurst of couetise
Such gredynesse each man should despise
For auaryce of custum in each place
Of hye prowess does the pris difface
Herodes after did search all the wardys
Through all the feeld upon Crassus side
Took the penouns baners and standardys
And in his temples large long and wide
Let hang^ them up of surquedye and pride
In sign only and eke for a memory
He of romans has get the victory
With which he list not only be content
Wenynge his fortune should abide stable
In to surrye he has his son sent
Called pachorus made him a constable
Of that region with him to be pertable
Of all tresours and meobles that he fond
Whereuer that he rode throughout all the land
This parchorus by his chiualrye
Encres began in his tender age
Whereof herodes his fader had envy
Feerfull it should turn to his damage
Lest he would by title of heritage
Maugre him at his ageyn coming
Take upon him of parthos to be king
Than pachorus was called home ageyn
And of surrye where in conclusion
All that he had wrought was in veyn
Because one Cassus fro rome was come down
Slough all the people in that region
Which apperteyned to pachorus as I find
Without capteyn for they were left behind
To witstande this romayn Cassius
Herodes has his son sent ageyn
Which anon after the story tells thus
Amyd the feeld vnhappyly was slain
To trust fortune it is a thing but vein
Which of custum to day is favorable
And to morrow gerysshly chaungeable
Of pachorus death when the noise aros
And the distrussynge of his chyualrye
And to herodes abiding in parthos
Tydynge was brought ferde as he would dye
Of hertely sorrow fill into frensye
Heir was none left of the royal lines
Save thrytty basterdes borne of concubynes
Thus herodes was cast in great sickness
His sons death was to him Importable
His wordly Joy was gone and his gladness
Fortune contrary which never can be stable
Age fill on his life was not durable
And of one thing most he did him dread
Cause he had none heir to succeed
Which would not suffer him live in pes
Till at the last he caught a fantasye
Chase a bastard called pharactes
Because he was famous in chyualrye
Gave him the crown and the regalye
Which anon after bruely to conclude
Slough herodes of Ingratitud^
How Fymbria a consul of rome slough him silf.
AFter to bochas by process of the book
Four mighty princys notable of estate
Toward him they cast chere and look
Like unto folk that were unfortunate
With whom fortune had been at debate
For by their manner as it sempt well
They were at mischeef fall fro her whele
First Fymbria a romayn consulere
Sent by the romans to a great cite
Called nichomede came as a messangere
To help flactus slain by great aduersite
As he entered into that cuntre
After whoos death his perty to auaunce
Of flaccus meyne took the governance
Of presumpcion without auctorite
This Fymbry^ by dyligent labor
Full far above his state and his degree
Took upon him by fortunes falls favor
To be called capteyne and emperor
Through all that cuntre bokys specefie
Of whoos presumpcion Scilla had envy
Pursued him through many great cite
To a castle made him take his flight
Where Fymbrya of great necessyte
Constreyned was maugre all his might
Disespeyred forsake of every wight
To sle him silf the storye tells thus
Within the temple of Esculapius
OF Albynius that was slain with stonys
ANother consul stood in cas sem lable
In his time called albynyus
Whoos hateful pride was abhomynable
To all folkys lothsum and odious
Which like a rebel wode and furious
Ageyn romans oftener than onys
When he lest wend slain was with stonys
How adriane borne of low degree falsely usurped to be king of rome which with
his chorles was after brent.
nExt Adryan which ros to hye estate
In his time called Albynius
First in rome borne of low degree
To govern of affryk the cuntre
Whereof his own pompous auctorite
Took upon him by subtle falls werkynge
Maugre romans there to be crownyd king
Whom to support shortly to conclude
Was a great noumbre of the comonte
Of chorls gadred a confus multitude
Title was non nor ground but volu^te
Gentle men than being in that cuntre
All of assent and one oppynyon
Assemblyd them to his destruction
At vtices a large great cite
Him and his churles beset round about
Of wode and faggot with large quantyte
In cumpas wise closyd him without
Gadred with him of vyleyns a great rout
Laid on fire that with flamys read
Echon consumed into ashes deed
How Synthonyus king of trace that much couetyd all forwent and dyed in
pouerte
nExt Adrian came Synthony^s
Tofore bochas with terys spreynt his face
As the storye rehersith unto us
In his time he was king of trace
F^ll suddenly from fortunes grace
Cast down low from his estate royal
Which came to bochas to compleyn his fall
Whose purpos was if it would have be
Seuene realmys to have conquered with his hand
That were subget to rome the cite
And all seuyn were of grekys land
Who all couetyth ye shall understand
He all forgoth full well afferme I dare
At unset hour whereof each man beware
Long or his conquest was brought to apreef
From her whele fortune cast him down
The praetor Sencius brought him to mischeef
Dyed in pouerte as made is mention
And Bochas here make a digression
Compendiously within a lityll space
To descriue the region of trace
Here bochas in perty makes a descripcion of the kingdom of Trace and passes
over lightly unto the acco^plysshment of his book
TRace whilom a cuntre of great fame
And conteyneth a full large space
And of tyras it took first the name
Son of Iaphet and so was called trace
Which many a day dwelled in that place
Toward Septemptrion plenteous of good
Beside Dynoe the large famous flode
Southwarde trace renneth the flode Egee
Macedoyne stands in the occident
And the kingdom called Perpontidee
Stant in trace toward the orient
Where great plente of blood was shed and spent
When Sencius through his hye prowess
King Adrian there manly did oppress
Ebrus in trace is the chef rite
As mine auctour makes mention
I castnat to tarry in this matere
To make of trace a description
But to proceed in my translacion
Follow mine auctoure which writes a long process
Of great Pompeye and his worthynesse
How after many great conquestys of duke Pompeye began great werre between
him and Iulyus Three hundred thousand were slain and at the last the head of
pompeye smetyn of
tHis pompeius of whom the name is couth
Wys and worthy and famous of prowess
Took upon him in his tender youth
After his fadre by fortunat duresse
Called pompeye the story bears witness
Distrussyd was by sodeyn death coming
The storye seith through thundrynge and lightnynge
His host destroyed by the violence
Of unware tempest like as seyth the book
Forty thousand slain in that pestylence
For fere the remenaunt the field anon forsook
Till young pompeie of courage on him took
In his beginning proudly to proceed
Full like a knight his fadres host to lead
Rome that time by their dissencions
Among them silf nigh brought to ruin
By the froward falls dyuysions
Twene Marye and Scylla breuely to termyne
Till that a new son began to shine
Of worthiness which shad his light
In manly pomp ye the noble famous knight
This seyde pompeye this noble knightly man
At his beginning through his chiualrye
The proud capteyne slough when he began
Which of marrius held up the party
Called Brutus which in Lumbardye
Was by pompeie through knightly governance
With all his host brought unto mischaunce
In his beginning pompeye eke also
To set romans in rest and quiet
One that was called Gueeus carbo
He slough him knightly when he did him mete
Which in Scicile proudly held his fete
And all the cuntrees about him enuyron
Pompeie made them subget to rome town
After all this pompeius on the se
With many a ship stuffed with vitayle
Toward affrik made a great arm
And there in haste after his arriuayle
With domicyus had a great battle
Brought the cuntre through his hye renoun
To be to rome under subjection
He pursued the great mighty king
Called Iertha to marrius favorable
And had also his royal abidynge
In Numedye a cuntre full notable
Ageyn pompei his powere was not able
For at a castle as they met in fight
He slough king Iertha full like a manly knight
This in breef time holding his passage
Fro common profit as made is mention
By his wysdom and knightly hye courage
Brought all affrik to subjection
Which stood before in rebellyon
To the romans but all their sturdinesse
The seid pompeie did in have redress
The gretest enmye again rome town
Thylke days was one Sertorius
And of fortune which is now up now down
On pompeie onys was victorious
But after sone of him it hapnyd thus
Among his meyne falling at debate
He slain was in his most hye estate
After the death of this Sertorius
Came Porpenna pompeie for tasseyle
And as they met anon pompeius
Full like a knight slough him in battle
Which victory greatly did avail
To the romans after by governance
He brought spain to their obeysaunce
By auctoryte you by the senate
This noble pompeye for veil of the cite
Upon the se would suffer no pirat
Where ever he came fro him they did fle
For with his shippis he scored so the se
And bare him there so manly with his hand
That maugre them he brought them to the land
All these pirates and these falls robbour^
I gadred out were of the regyon*
Called Scicile which like to rauynours
Made ageyn rome a conspiracion
Robbyd spoiled seylynge up and down
Romayne marchauntys and people of each cuntre
That none was hardy to pass by the se
After pompeie has made these to obey
That pyrat none durst thereon abide
He by the Senate was sent out to werrey
Toward the oryent his knightys by his side
And where so ever that he did abide
Mine auctour write by influence of heuyn
His conquest was swift as fire or leuene
And to encres of his eternal glory
Perpetually to get him a name
His laud and renoun to put in memory
He byldyd a cite in asia of great fame
Called Nychopoly bochas seith the same
Twene two flodys that one araxases
And that other was called cufrates
He byldyd this cite only of intent
That romayn knightys that were fall in age
And such as were in the werrys spente
Should of custom have their herbergage
In that cite alwey and not fail
Beddynge clothys spending and vitayle
Pompeye after rode into armenye
Rebel to rome where Tigranes was king
Faught with him there and through his chiualrye
Disconfyted him there was none abiding
Where Tigranes him silf submyttynge
Unto pompeye with every circumstaunce
Ever to abide under his obeysaunce
Than in all haste pompey began him hye
To ride in asia where like a manly knight
He gate the kingdom called Albanye
Which took his name who so look aright
Of witness for every manner wight
That there is borne by record of wrytinge
White as snow has his here shynynge
There been houndys marvelous of nature
For tassayle bolys and lions
No wild be may ageyn him dure
So pompeye by many regyons
Rode through armenye with his chaumpions
Where grown herbys that may never f^ynte
What ever color men list with them peynte
Conqueryd realmys about in every coost
Of hiberye he gate the region
And artaces the king with all his often
Disconfited as made is mention
With his power to Surrye he came down
Than to fenyce a kingdom of great fame
Which of fe^^x whilom took his name
Brought all these cuntrees to subjection
Of Cydonye the mighty strong cite
Of Iturie he took possession
Through arabye he came down to Inde
Which of Jews was sumtyme the cuntre
Of lybanus he passed the mounteyne
Where cedres grow as auctours seyn
Sent tofore him entering in that reame
One Gabynus amighty strong cunstable
Regnynge that time in Ierusaleme
Aristobolus a prince full notable
And for the temple was strong and premyable
Laid a syege about in bread and lengeth
Space of three menethys gate it so by strength
Three thousand Iewys under the wall were found
Deed at the assaute which made resistance
The wall after betyn down to ground
Pompey after by sturdy violence
Is entered in without reverence
Sancta sanctorum men that place call
Made Hircanius highest priest of all
The great bishop Aristob^lus
Sent to rome in mighty cheynys bound
Toward septentrion I find written thus
Gate seuene kingdoms with citees walled round
Rebel to rome he did them confound
With mighty sword gate all the cuntre
Fro cancasus down to the read se
In his conquest it sempt verily
As the goddys had done their cure
And that fortune was with them eke besy
This mighty pompeie prince of assure
What ever him list by conquest to rec^^e
In spain he gate when they were rebels
Three hundred cytees and sixty strong castles
Hard to remember his conquestys euerychon
All the prowessys of this knightly man
Toward the party of Septemtrion
A thousand castles I find that he wan
Six hundred mo fro time that he began
Eight and thretty citees out of doubt
With mighty wallys closyd round about
Peyse his dedys his conquestys marciall
Thryse consul chose for his encrees
Read ye shall find how he was egall
To alisaundre or to hercules
Where that ever he put him silf in pres
All came to hand concludynge ye may se
To common profit of rome the cite
His marciall dedys to put in remembrance
One was chose to do his diligence
To enacte his conquest in substance
And his knighthode to singular excellence
And triffanes famous of eloquence
Assigned was unto that labor
Took his guerdon of their common tresoure
Pompey of rome was cheef governor
Caesar absent in Gaul a fer cuntre
Which time pompeie stood in great fauour^
Both of fortune and rome the cite
Sumwhat made blind of his prosperyte
Purposinge in his clymbynge not stable
He would have none that were to him semblable
Unto purpos was said full yore agoon
How that love nouther hye lordship
Preef has be made in many mo than oon
Nouther of them would have no felawshipe
Each by his one would his party keep
In these two cas brother unto brother
Fails at a point each will put out other
To pompeie resorting now ageyn
He took on him all the gouernayle
Of the romans as ye have herd me seyne
Both of estatis commons and porayle
And for his part all that might avail
In making laws statute or decre
All up engrossed by his auctoryte
Folk this while which that had envy
Toward caesar in his long absence
Let make a law by conspiracye
And a statute concludinge in sentence
Without excepcion favor or reverence
No man should by will of the senate
In his absence be chose to none estate
Nor be admyttyd by no procuratoure
To have auctorite of dignite nor offyre
In court of tribune nor of senator
To be promotyd this was their aduys
Were he never so manly nor so wys
This law ordained by folk enuyous
For hyndrynge only of caesar Julius
When Julius knew all their falls werkinge
Fro gaul sent up to the cite
All the senate requerynge by writynge
To grant him by their auctorite
Of tryumphe the notable dignite
To have also thoffys and estate
Called in rome the second consulate
For him alledgynge many great victory
In diverse cuntrees done for the cite
Many conquest notable of memory
Wrought by his knighthode for which of equite
Requerynge them guirdoned for to be
But contrary unto his entente
Denied him all by one assente
Which was cheef ground rote and occasion
That brought in first the contr^uersye
Ciuyly discordys froward division
When every man drough to his party
Of old hatrede to kyndle new envy
Causinge princis Julius and Pompeye
To their confusion each other to werrey
The triumph denied to caesar
Fraud of pompeye made him thereof fail
Of whoos deceyte Julius was war
Made him ready with many strong battle
Passed over the alpies of Itayle
Fully in purpos plainly if he might
With the romans and pompeye for to fight
Thus began the werres atwene these princys tweyne
Pompeie chose for party of the town
To be their duke and capteyn souereyn
Again Caesar as made is mention
And thus alas the disolacion
Sued of the cite by many strange sign
With uncouth toknys when they began malign
At the gynnynge of these woeful werrys
In the heaven were seen dreadful sightys
Sparklynge brondes cometis uncouth sterris
With flame of fire many feerfull lightys
Like lampys brennynge all the long nighty^
Casting of sperys dartys in the air
Whereby romans fill in great despair
From the party of Septemtrion
Toward rome came full great lightnynge
At noone seen sterrys like blood the son shone
The moon eclipsyd terrible in showing
The mount Ethna feerfull brennynge
From his cauernys castup flamys read
Toward Itayle which set them in right great dread
But of caribdys a danger of the se
Wawys terrible boiled up like blood
From the rokkys that in Scicile be
Was herd howlynge of houndys that were wode
Vesta the goddess in rome where she stood
Myd her temple was all with terys spreynt
When the heavenly fyres were before her queynt
Before the goddess at the altar principal
Was fire perpetuell brennynge day and night
Till werrys Cyuile hateful and terrible
Began among romans in the contagious fight
Than of vengeance anon was queynt the light
Tofore vesta the fire partynge on tweyne
Of dyuision a tokne full certain
Earth quaues soden and terrible
Ouertourned castles up so down
With rage flodys hydous and horrible
Neptunus did great destruction
Drowned villages and many mancion
Reuersyd in templys of gold all their vessels
Threw down baners standardys and pensels
Geyne these signs was found none arest
The unware mischeef could no man declyne
Lions wolves came down fro the foreste
With many other beestys sauagyne
Wild bestys and serpentys of rauyne
Came to the cite and su^me again kind
Spoke as do men in bochas thus I find
Diverse folks which of their nature
(...) in custom to fle but a night
Before these werrys did him silf assure
Euene at mydday when phoebus is most bright
Through then cite for to take their flight
Wymen with child the storye list not feyne
Brought forth su^me that had hedys tweyne
Tofore these werrys that called were Cyuile
Senators being in rome town
C^m to the woman that called was cibyle
Unto her made this questyon
To declare by short conclusion
Among their other questions all
Of their cite what fortune should befall
To whom she gave an answer full obscure
Whereupon she made them sore muse
Took them six lettres set in pleyn scripture
Which in no wise they might not refuse
For falls rightes that they did use
Like the three lettres twyes set in noumbre
Who understands they shall the town encoumbre
Three R R R first she set on a row
And three F F F in order fast by
Long time after or they could know
The exposicion thereof opynly
Till their diuynours began search subtylly
To find out like to their intent
By the syx lettres what Cybile meant
O of this word regnum the first lettre is R
So is the capytall of rome the cite
Who look aright the thryd is not fer
This word Ruet gynneth with R parde
Of which wordys when they joined be
The sentence concludes in menynge
Of their cite the Ruyno us fallinge
Touching three F F F who can advertise
Of this word ferro F goth toforne
And the cheef lettre of fames to deuyse
Is F also the process well forth borne
The same of Flamma by which the town was lorne
Of which resons make a conjunction
Causynge of rome fyn all destruction
Fire sword and hungre caused by the werrys
Desire of clymbynge froward ambicion
Showing of cometis and of uncouth sterris
With pronostekys of their desercion
Worst of all wilful dyuision
Among them silf by unware violence
Of lettres six accomplisshed the sentence
The sword of Caesar werrys of pompeye
Twene these tweyne lasting a great while
Made many romayne and Italien to dye
By the batayles that called were Cyuile
With prophecies remembryd of Cybile
As the writynge full well reherce can
Of the old poet that called was lucan
In martys temple on heith where he stood
And bellona the goddess despitous
The prestys cried and offered up their blood
With lamentacion like folk furious
Cause of toknes fell and contrarious
Which that were showed in that sentuary
How their goddys to romans were contrary
Monge deed bonys that lay in their grauis
Were voycis herd like woodmen in their ragi^
Cry of goostys in kauernys and ka^ys
Herd in feldys pathis and passages
Laborers fled home to their villages
Serpentys adders scalyd silver bright
Were over rome seyne flyenge all the night
Another tokne pytous for to here
Which astonyed many proud romayn
Deed bodies did in the feelde appear
Which in battle had before be slain
Fro their toumbes arysynge where they layn
Which in the werres woeful and dispitous
Were slain by Scilla and proud ma^tius
It was eke told by their dyuynours
How pompeyus was like to have a fall
And how thestate of romayn emperors
With their triumphs that be Imperial
At Iuluis first begin shall
And after him thestate shall forth proceed
By election or lynyall kynrede
To withstonde the power of caesar
Which toward rome took his wey right
Pompeye was sent wis manly and right war
But when he herd tell of the might
Of Julius he took him to the flight
Eke all the senators with him did fle
Toward Epyre in greece a strong cite
Pompeie was old famous in chiualrye
Caesar but young hardy for to assail
Upon the pleyns of greece and thessalye
Pompeye and he had a great battle
Geyn Julius sword no romayn might avail
Constreyned of force the field to forsake
Toward Egypt they have the wey take
Pompeye through cypre came to Tholome
By a great water at paphus did arryue
On the stronde there he did se
A stately place and up he went blyue
The name of which pleinly to descryue
Cacobasile the cuntre did it call
Of which name the fortune is thus fall
The name tokneth of froward arriuayle
Sownynge in great unhappy adventure
By which the trust of pompeye did fail
Fill in despeire might it not recure
Forsook that I Will did his besy cure
To take a ship so by the se saylynge
Toward Egypt where tholome was king
Of trust he fled to this tholome
In hope he should find in him socoure
Fair chere showed under duplicite
Failed at the point gave him feynt favor
Albe pompeye by his friendly labor
Crowned him king in Egypt as I find
To whom ageyn he was falls and unkind
To mete pompeye he let stuf a barge
By a manner pretense of frendlyhede
Gave his menye that were there in charge
To mordre pompeie byhight them a great mede
Tweyne there were that bare to him hatrede
And in the vessel with sharp swerdys whet
Or he was ware of his head they smet
That one of them was called achyllas
And his fellow named was fotyne
Took up the head of that prince alas
Famous in knighthode borne of gentyl line
Among romans as auctours determyne
Bold in his time if men do him right
Through all the world one the best knight
Thus erthely princys with all their pompous fame
Which through all the world yeueth so great a soun
Of slaughtre and mordre they took first their name
By falls rauyne and extorcion
Clambe up first so to domynacion
Brennynge of cuntrees conquest by violence
Set them in chayres of worldly excellence
In this battle that called was ciuyle
Hold atwene pompeye and caesar Julius
Three hundryd thousand slain within a while
Three thousand take the storye tells thus
Without princis notable and glorious
As kings pretours reknyd all atonys
Trybunys consulys and centuryonys
Phoebus on the soil might not his bemys sprede
Nor on the ground show out his clear light
Men that were slain lay so thycke on bread
That of the earth noman had a sight
Wulues berys rauynous fowls of flight
Came great plente to feed them there each day
Beside the ryuere of Nyle where they lay
Gobettys of flessh which foulys did arare
Fro deed bodies borne up in the air
Fill fro their clees upon Julius face
Amyd the feeld where he had repair
Made his visage blody and not fair
Albe that he to his encreas of glory
Had thilke day of romans the victory
The head of pompeye brought with his statly ring
Offered up to Julius hye presence
He by compassion the murdre aduertysynge
Of his Innat imperial excellence
Brast out to weep and in his aduertence
Thought great pity a prince of so great might
Should so be slain that was so good a knight
The coors abode without sepulture
Till one Codrus of compassion
After the battle and disconfiture
Besought him of great affection
To hyde the Trunk low in the sondys down
Sought timber and there he fond but small
To do exequies with fyres funeral
Now since this prince came to such mischeef
Murdryd and slain by tholome the king
Here of her power fortune has made a preef
What trust there is in any wordly thing
After his death wantyd he not buryenge
This proud pompeie so famous of his hand
Of fyssh devoured as he lay on quyksonde
What shall men set by power or noblesse
Of slydinge godys or any wordly glory
Which to restreyne may be no syerenesse
Fortune and the world is transitorye
Though mars to day give a man victory
Parcas tomorowe unwarily he shall deie
I take record of Caesar and pompeye
Since all stant under daungere of fortune
y^ wordly men do your look up dress
To thilke place where joy does ay co^^une
The blind lady has there none interesse
Se^ pride aside take you to meekness
To (...) virtue do truly your labor
^^yn worldly pomp make pompeie your mirroure
Lenuoye.
THis tragedye of the duke pompeye
Declares in gros the cheef occasion
Why he and caesar began first werreie
Each ageyn other through vayn ambycion
To have lordshyp and domynacion
Over the romans by favor fraud or might
Possession take no force of wrong nor right
To trouthis party pride is loath to obey
Extort power does great destruction
Wys policy all out of the weye
Prudente counsel age with discrecion
Lost their lyberte of fre election
Who was most strong with him held every wight
Possession take no force of wrong nor right
Such diuysion made many man to deye
Brought the cite to disolacion
With two princys fortune list to pley^
Till from her whele she cast them both down
Subtle diceit fraud and collusion
By ambycious clymbynge blent their both light
Possession take no force of wrong nor right
Noble princys remember what I seye
Peyse this storye within in your reason
Of falls surmountynge auaryce berith the keye
Record of Caesar pompeye of rome town
Whoos wylfull werrys hateful discencion
Yeueth clear warning to you and every wight
No claim is worth without title of right
How victorious Julius Caesar brent the vessels of Tholome: slough achillas
that would have murdryd him: and after great victoryes him silfe was murdryd
with bo^dekens by brutus Cassius
AFter the woeful compleynt lamentable
Of pompeis death pytous for to here
Werres remembered with tresons importable
Compassed frauds fraced with fair chere
Conspired murdre reherced the manner
How king tholome fraudolent of courage
The death conspyred of pompeie fall in age
The process told I hold it were but veyn
Thereof to write a new tragedye
Thing onys seyde it to reherce again
It were but idle as for that party
But how caesar went out of thessalie
Came to alisaundre to lodge him in that place
I will remember with support of your grace
He lodgyd was in the paleis royal
Where he was besy by dyligent labor
Through that region in temples royal
To spoil goddys and have all their tresoure
Where he was mockyd fond there no favor
For achillas which that slough pompeie
Cast him with caesar proudly to werreye
His purpos was to fall upon caesar
As of nature was his condition
Falsely to murdre men or they were war
By some slight to find occasion
To destroy Julius by treson
And to accomplissh his purpos in party
Had twenty thousand in his cumpany
Incipit Liber Of Antonye son and heir to great Antonye: An^
tHis story endyd last of the sixth book
Bochas weary thought for the best
Of great travail oppressyd in his book
Fill in a slombre lenynge on his cheste
Fully in purpose to have take his rest
But euene as ^ere^t should have take
Came a great pres and made him to awake
First of that felawship came the son and heir
Of antonye with blood spreynt all his wede
Called antonye fall in great despeire
Cause Octauyan bare to him hatrede
Whoos sword he fled quakynge in his dread
To an old temple socour for to have
Trusting from death the place should him save
(...) As the preestys did their besy cure
To offer a calf anon or they took head
The same calf a thing ageyn nature
Brought forth a lamb the same time I read
An ougly tokne which put them in full great dread
A contrary pron^sticacion
Showed unto them of their subversion
With other toknys froward and contrary
The same time were showed ever among
The brazen dorys of the inward sentwarye
With iron barrys shet that were most strong
Broad of entayle round and wondre long
That might not meue with thretty men's might
Opnyd by them silf twyse on a night
There were seyn also charys in the air
Men of armies with bright swerdys clear
Of plate and mayle armure was so fair
Bright as phoebus where they did appear
And as the story also does us lere
With their sheltrons and their apparayle
A profre made their cite Ierlm^ for to assail
To the Iewys it did signefye
A pronostyke of their destruction
Preestys to the temple as they did them hye
Upon a night to do oblacion
Amyd the temple was herd a dredefull soun
Of which noise this was the dreedfull end
Rys up echon and late us hens wend
And full four year tofore the siege began
One ananyas young and tender of age
Of his birth son of a rude man
By disposicion dull of his courage
Like as he had fall in a rage
Ran in the cite by a manner frensye
Spared not with opyn mouth to cry
Unto this noise was made non obstacle
But obstynat ever to his intent
Day of the feast hold in the tabernacle
A voice quod he out of the orient
Voice fro the south fro north and occidente
Voice fro the four winds yt blow so broad and wide
Voice again Jerusalem cries out on every side
Voice geyn the temple ageyn the people also
Voice ageyn husbondes voice ageyn their wives
Woe to Jerusalem with a treble woe
Of hungre thrust and lesynge of their lives
(...) (...)
Which have Itayle like a son clear
With poetrye plainly to descryue
Most souereynly enlumyned by your live
I have desired as it is well couth
Of rightful heart by humble attendaunce
To do you worship fro my tender youth
And so shall ever void of all variaunce
During my life for trewly in substance
Ye have been lantern light and direction
Ay to support mine occupacion
As in writynge bokys to compyle
Cheef exaumple to my great advantage
To refourme the rudnesse of my style
With aureat colors of your fressh langage
But now for dullyd by impotence of age
Of decrepytus markyd with many a sign
My labor up of writynge I resign
I cast me not forth to proceed
Stand at a bay for dryuene for werynesse
Quod frauncis petrak lose not thus thy mede
Give men no cause to report nor express
In thy last age thou have found a mastresse
Which has the brydlyd in soth and that is routh
And holds thy rene and she is called sloth
An euydent tokne of froward slogardye
(...) to ^resse
Rise up for shame for I can well espy
Folk that can groan and feel no sickness
Their chaumbyrleyn is called Idleness
Which leith thy pillowe at eve and at morrow
Void her from the and let her go with sorrow
To all virtue froward and contrary
Is Idleness here in this present lif
Which has the draw away fro thy librarye
Will the not suffer to be contemplatyf
For her condition is to hold stryf
With every virtuous occupacion
Which men should void of wisdom and reason
In this matere what should I long tarry
Thy slombre leave and up thyn iyen dress
The book I made of life solitarye
Remember thereon the which in sekirnesse
Techeth the way of virtuous business
By and by who list read every line
Of contemplacion moral and dyuyne
As I seide erst yet lift up thy look
Forsake thy bed rise up anon for shame
Would thou rest now upon thy seventh book
And leave thy eight in soth thou art to blame
Proceed forth and get thy silf a name
And with one thing do thy silf a confort
As thou deseruest men after shall report
Make a comparison twene dyrknesse and light
Twene Idleness and occupacion
Twene fair days and the cloudy night
Twene a cowarde prowess and hye renoun
Twene virtuous spech and falls detraction
And to conclude all vices to repress
Contrary to sloth is virtuous business
Virtuous besines O bochas take good head
Renews all things of old antiquite
Makes men to live after they be deed
Remembers the noblesse of many great cite

This same tyrant regnynge in his estate
To all the cite was passing odious
Best and most worthy he slough of the Senate
And unto all that were virtuous
Mortal enmye and most malicious
And for slaughter of senators in the town
Axed the tryumphe as made is mention
Made among Jews by full great outrage
Where as he had grettest suspicion
To sle all tho that were of the lynage
Of Dauyds kynrede of king Salamon
Lest he were put out of domynacion

Punyssh a tiraunt and quyte him his mede
This domician was slain upon a night
His careyne after unburied as I read
And comodus does after him succeed
Which was all you by flesshly appetite
To leave all virtue and follow his delight
Theater plays of custom he did use
As was the custum there and the usage
His lif in vices he falsely did abuse
In lecherous lustys dispent all his young age
To the romans did full great damage
For of the senate that were most virtuous
Were falsely sleyne by this Comodus
In his time by stroke of thondredent
And fyry lightnynge that came down fro heuene

With royal bokys of all the craftis seuene

Right sad and wise in that they had to do

Slain in battle for they list not fle
Tofore their death both of assent parde
Their tresoure hole that were Imperial
To cristys church I find they gave it all
The busshop Sixtus took possession
Virtuously assignyd it to laurence
Thereof to make distribucion
To pore folk in their indigence
For which deed by cruel violence
The tiraunt decyus again them took a stryf
Caused holy laurence by brennynge lose his life
This same decius cursyd and cruel
Caused the slaughter of these philippes tweyne
And for he was subtle falls and fell
By sleight and falshede he did his besy pain
To the empire by force for to atteyne
The vii tyrant by persecucion
Which again christian folk took first occasion
Mine auctoure writes time of this decius
The holy hermyte exaumple of persightnesse
By days old called antonyus
Lived in desert far out in wilderness
As an hermyte despysynge all richesse
Lived by fruit and rotys as men tell
And of perfection drank water of the well
Upon Decyus for his cursidnesse
Ageyn christian which gave so herd sentence
Through rome and Itayle mine auctour berith witness
In every cite was great pestilence
That by the sodeyn dedly violence
The hertys of men dependynge in a trance
To save their lives could no cheuesaunce
Of this matter write no more I can
To this emperor I will resort ageyn
Speak of gallus and volucian
That besy were their labor was in vein
Their time short as su^me bokys seyn
For Martyn writes and old Croniculere
In thempyre they reigned but two year
But both were slain by the procuringe
And by the purchase of one emelyne
A romayn knight which by slye werkynge
To occupye them pyre tho began
By tyranny the lordship there he wan
Whoos lordship for hap and lack of grace
No lengre last than two months space

This lady fortune the blind fell gaddesse

Taught him a lesson of the doubleness
To king Sapor she was favorable

With his fete deuoyde of all favor

But there was a thing eclipsyd of his glory
Which has the light of his knighthode withdraw
For he was enmye to criste and to his law
Of him bochas list no more to write

Of me remembrynge that called was Tacyte
Which was successoure to Aurelian
And after him succedyd Folorian
Of which tweyne no remembrance I find

And iiii monethis which by his hye renoun

And all their meyne of very force and might
Slain in the field the remenau^t put to flight
After this bataile and this disconfiture
Probus was lodgyd in Smyryue a great cite
And there unawarely of soden adventure

How the hardy queen zenobya faugh^ with Aurelean and was take
Mine auctoure here no longer list soiourne
Of these emperors the falls for to write
But in all have he does his style turn
To zenobya his story to endyte
But for chauncer did him so well acquit
In his tragedyes her pytous fall to entrete
I will pass over rehersynge but the great
In his book of Cantirbury tales
This sovereign poet of brutus albion
Through pilgrims told by hills and by valy^
Whereof zenobya is made mention
Of her noblesse and her hye renoun
In a tragedye compendiously told all
Her marciall prowess and her pitous fall
Mine auctoure first affermeth how that she
Descendyd was to tell of her lynage
Borne of the stock of worthy tholome
King of (...) full notable in that age
(...)
But for because of this horrible deed
And for the murdre of king Odomate
Dyed at mischeef and passyd into fate
By process after zenobia the queen
Took her two sons and proudly did them led
Tofore her chare that men might them seen
How they were borne as princys to succeed
Made them like kings clad in purple wede
Them to diffende this mighty creature
Hardy as lion took on her armure
For all her lordys and knights she had sent
Maugre the romans proudly began hye and speed
All the parties of the orient
To occupye and her host so led
Of the Emperor she stood no thing in dread
Called Aurelian met him in battle
With her meynye proudly did assail
On outher side that day great blood was shed
The stroke of fortune withstant no creature
The queen zeno bya was taken and forth led
Faught first as long as she might endure
With rich stonys fret was her armure
With whom the emperor so entringe rome town
Of tryumphe requeryd the guyrdoun
He dempt it was couenable and sitting
This emperor this proud ^urelian
To axe the triumph it was so great a thing
To take zenobya that such a werre began
Geyne romans this marciall woman
For I suppose of no woman borne
Was never queen so hardy seen aforn
This hardy princess for all her cruelte
Whose hye renown through all the world was know
With stocks of gold was brought to the cite
From hye estate in pouert plungyd low
Awynde contrary fortune has so blow
That she alas has pitously made fall
Her that in prowess passyd wymen all
The triumph youen to aurelian
For the conquest he had upon this queen
Called zenobya came dioclisian
Borne in dalmacia his storye who list fene
Out of his cuntre first he did flene
Of garle^e and lekys as seith the croniculere
Because that he was but a gardinere
Other mention is none of his lynage
Of his birth forsook the region
Left his craft of deluynge and cor^lage
Gave him to armies and by eleccion
Chose to be emperor and regne in rome town
First into Gaul he sent a great power
And maximian he made his vicar
His vicar there had many great battle
Upon such people that by rebeellion
Began frowardly and contrary to assail
To obey his lordshyp within that region
Till Caramsynus by commission
And an hardy knight under maxymyan
Them to chastise took on him like a man
But by process the storye does deuyse
His lordshyp there did great damage
To common profit so he by couetise
The cuntre robbyd by full great outrage
And to him silf he took all the pyllage
And of prsumpcion ware the color
Of rich purple like an emperor
This Caramsinus of Breteyns tweyne
Proudly usurped to be their gouernoure
Like a rebel geyne rome did his pain
And besyed him by marciall labor
With many strange foreyn soudioure
Having no title nor commission
Continued long in his rebellion
Whereof astonyed was dioclisian
Seeing this mycheef dreedfull and perilous
Ordained in haste that maximyan
Was surnamed and called herculyus
Made him emperor called augustus
Which had before no more governance
But gaul which now is called france
Also moreover this dioclisian
Made in this while governors tweyne
Constancyus and one maxymyan
Surnamed Galerius constancius in certain
In this while to wed did his pain
Daughter of maxymyan called herculyus
Named Theodora mine auctour writes thus
By theodora this constancius
Had six children in true marriage
Brother to Constantyne the cronycle tells thus
Which afterward when he came to age
For his manhood and marciall courage
Was chose and made lord and governor
Of all the world crownyd emperor
Caramsynus which had full seuene year
Like as I told rebellyd breteyne
Ageyn the romans a great extorcionere
A knight Alletus that did at him disdeyne
Murdryd him and after did his pain
By force only and extorte tyranny
Fully three year his place to occupye
Till Asclepio was sent from Rome down
Slough alletus maugre all his might
Brought all bretayne to subjection
Of the romans like as it was right
And in this while like a manly knight
For Italiens began romans disobey
Constancius began proudly them werreye
He first with them had a strong battle
His meyne slain and put to the flight
Trusting on fortune he began them eft assail
And sixty thousand were slain in that fight
The field was his through fortunys might
As she that could dissymule for a while
And afterward falsely him begyle
Froward enmy he was to cristis law
Many a martyr to dye for his sake
Wext feeble and old and began him withdraw
From occupacion his rest for to take
His attorney maxymyan he does make
In his last age it is rehercyd thus
Stood in great dread of constancius
The dread of him sat so nigh his heart
And thereupon took such a fantasye
Imagenynge he might not sterte
By fraud of him but that he should dye
Almost for fere fill in a frensye
Of which dread the book makes mention
He slough him silf by drinking of poison
As I told erste in the occident
Maxymyan called herculyus
Regnyd as emperor and ever in his intent
To pursue martirs he did ay his labors
Of whose birth bochas found non auctours
This to say he could never read
Where he was borne nor of what kinrede
He finds no more of this maxymyan
Of his usurping in especial
But that he was by dioclisyan
(...)
But afterward he fill in repentance
And besy was as diverse seyn
Thestate of emperor to recure again
Which for to acheue he did his diligence
He was distourbyd by Galerius
For his son that called was maxence
Put in possession mine auctoure writes thus
To which thing he began wex enuyous
And began ordeyne menys in his thought
To trouble him but it auayled naught
When his purpos might take none avail
Again mexence as bochas does descryue
His daughter Fausta that knew all his counceile
Discured his purpose for which he fled blyue
Into Gaul and durst no lengre strive
And by Constancius in Marcyle the cite
Slain suddenly lost all his dignyte
How Galerius oppressed martyrs / and cristys feith / and myscheuously endyd
nExt tofore bochas came Galerius
A man disposyd to riot and outrage
Evil tetchid froward and vicious
There is no storye ye speaks of his lynage
Yet was he set full hye upon a stage
Of worldly dignyte ros up to hye estate
Yet in his gynnynge he was not fortunate
He was sent out by dyoclysian
And made emperor by his auctorite
Ageyn Narseus the proud knightly man
Regnynge in perce and lord of that cuntre
Which held werre with rome the cite
For which galerius took upon him this empryse
With mighty hand his pride to chastyse
Galerius entryd into perce land
King Narseus met him of adventure
Had a strong bateyle faught hand for hand
His fortune such he might not endure
On galerius fill the disconfitre
Clad in purple as made is mention
Of dioclisian received this guyrdon
At their metinge anon or they were ware
Dioclisian made him to abide
To his confusion sitting in his chare
To walk on foot by the charys side
With many a rebuke batyd was his pride
Galerius for the great shame
Began seek a mean ageyn to get his name
Came for tassemble his old soudyours
Made his ordenaunce by diligent werkinge
Chase out the best prouyd werreours
With a great host to perce he came riding
And often there faught with the king
That the perciens maugre all their might
Were of Galerius that day put to flight
The field was his gate their richesse
Robbyd their tentys wan there great pyllage
In this resort received in sothenesse
In great noblesse because of that viage
Thus can fortune change her visage
Of dioclisian where he stood in disdeyne
With new tryumphe resortyd is ageyn
This cloudy queen stands ever in no certain
Whoos double whele quauerith ever in doubt
Of whose favor noman has be certain
Though one have grace another is put out
Late every man as it comes about
Take his turn and never in her assure
Faylynge in armies is but adventure
Thus galerius after his battle
On perciens began wex glorious
Governed affryk and lordshyp of Itayle
Thrughout the orient he was victorious
Till he for age began wex tedious
His last days malygned as men seith
Of falls hatrede ageyn christian feith
And him to help in these falls matters
It is remembryd to his confusion
In his empire he set two vikers
Gave them power in every region
The law of criste to oppress and put down
To punyssh martirs and put them to the death
And in this while full many one he sleth
By this seid cruel galerius
Which of thempyre had all the governance
Of cursyd heart and courage despytous
By his vsurpyd Imperial puissaunce
Gave auctoryte for to do vengeance
Unto tweyne Seuerus and maxence
On all christian by mortal violence
A certain space both of one accord
Thestate of Emperor chose was maxence
Till Seuerus and he fill at discord
And after by vengeable pestilence
Within a cite of noble premynence
Called Rauenne Seuerus there was slain
Of which galerius god wot was nothing feign
For which in haste this galerius
Him to supporte and stand in his diffence
Chase out of Denmark a knight lueynyus
To be emperor through knightly excellence
For to withstonde and fight ageyn maxence
But maxence of romayn knightys all
Was chosyn emperor and set up in his stall
With which eleccion galerius wex wode
Fill in a manner froward frenzy
His entrayle burnt corrupt was his blood
And of his froward vengeable maledye
In every membre began rote and putryfie
Till all the air about him enuyron
To all that felt it was v^nym and poison
L^ke a la^ar corbed ^ak and (...)
It was his Joy for to shede her blood
Sent out lettres to diverse regions

With furies infernal lies now in hell bound
How Maxence the emperor enmy to cristis feith myscheuously endyd

Famous in armies sturdye fressh and bold

But of his purpos in soth he did fail
For he was twyse disconfyted in battle
By constantyne onys in hungrye

Thus constantyne through his hye renoun
Gate nigh greece and every great cuntre
Albe l^^ynyus stood in rebellion
Geyn constantyne both on land and se
But when he saw it would nonother be
He might not escape in no place
Put holy him silf in constantyns grace
But constantyne for his hye rebellyon
Gave Judgment in have that he be deed
Lest in the cite were made division
By luc^^yus whereof he stood in dread
This same while as bochas took head
There came before him with chere full pitous
Brethren tweyne Constantyne and Crispus
OF Constantyne and Crispus: and how Dalmacius was slain
tO Constontyne of whom I spoke toforn
They were sons Constantyne and crispus
The same tweyne of one modre borne
Came tofore bochas his book rehercith thus

Before was slain for his rebellion
Constantyne his werrys to govern
Made them vicars the silf same three
Echon right wys and could well descerne
What might avail most to their cite
To encres the profit of the comonte
Their names told Constantyne and crispus
Tofore remembryd with them lucinyus
While these three vicars under the emperor
Gouernyd rome as knights most famous
In alisaundre rose up a great error
By a falls priest called Arryu^
To our believe a thing contrarious
And for he did again our feyth so wirch
By a decre was put out of the chirch
By assent at Bethenye full notable

Feyned a cause to sle them all three
No cause rehersyd nor told of equity

To make his cosyn Dalmacius to succeed
But his favor was not fortunate
Toward dalmacius nor gracious in sentence
Among whoos knightys fill a sodeyn debate

THan came Constaunce and Constancius
Young brethern thus writes mine auctoure
To constantyne in time of arrius
And each of them by full great labor
Did his pain to regne as Emperor
Till at the last breuely for to seye
Euerich of them began other to werreye
This seid constaunce is entryd perce land
Nine times he faught again Sapore
The same king as ye shall understand
That with romans had foughten before
But finally constaunce has him so bore
To hold the feelde he might not endure
For upon him fill the disconfiture
His fortune began change anon right
When that he left to be virtuous
He was in spain slain like a knight
In Castrell tongue called maxencius
Than was none left but Constancius
The romayn knights destitute euerychone
Chase them an Emperor vetramone
This vetramone was far run in age
Bareyn of wit could no lettrure
Nor in knighthode had no great courage
Nor was not able to study in scripture
Nor like an emperor no while to endure
For Constancyus of whom I spoke now late
With this vetramone cast him to debate
This vetramone has left his estate
List not werreye again Constancyus
Forsook the feelde louyd no debate
But of spain mine auctoure writes thus
As I wrote late how that magnencius
Geyne Constancyus with sword spear and sheelde
Presumed proudly for to hold a feelde
To great damage and hyndrynge of the town
For many romayne thilke day was deed
Byside a cite which called was Leon

Ageyn constancius has the field forsake
Loo how fortune can her chaungys make
Magnencyus for very sorrow and shame

How Constantyne baptized by Syluestre was ^ured of his lepre
OF this matere stynte I will awhyle
And following mine own strange opinion
Fro Constancyus turn away my style
To his fader make a digression
Cause bochas makes short mention
Of constantyne which by record of clerkys
Was so notable found in all his works
This mighty prince was borne in Brytayne
So as the brute pleynly does us lere
His holy modre called was helayne
He in his days most knightly and entere
Of marciall actys he knew all the matere
Chosyn emperor for his hye noblesse
Fill to lepre cronycules does express
His sore so grievous that no medycyne
Might aua^le his likeness to recure
H^ ^ounseyled to make a great pystyne
With Innocents of chyldre that were pure
(...) of that he did endur^

With full glad chere made them to repair
Where they came sorry to rome the cite
They have returned glad to their cuntre
Royal compassion did in his heart mine

His royal court he did so ordeyne
Through each cuntre so far sprad out the light
Who that ever came thydre to complain
By wrong oppressed and required of right
In his diffence he should find a knight
To him assigned finally to entende
By marciall dome his quarrel to diffende
If it fell so that any strange knight
Sought auentures and thydre came fro far
To do armies his request made of right
His challenge seen were it of pees or werre
Was accept to the court came nerre
Like as he came with manyor alone
They were delivered forsake was never none
There was the scole of marcyall doctrine
For young knights to learn all the gyse
In tender age to learn full disciplyne
On horse and foot by notable exercise
Thing take in youth does help in many wise
And idleness in grene years gonne
Of all virtues clypsith the clear son
Wydowes maydyns oppressyd folk also
Of extort wrongs wrought by tyranny
In that cuntre what nation came thereto
Received were there list no man deny
Of their complayntes found ready remedy
Made no delay but forth anon right
Them to diffende assignyd was a knight
Eke by their order they bound were of troth
By assurance and by oath sworn
In their emprises let for no sloth
Pleynly to tell how they have them born
Their adventure of things done beforne
Right as it fill spare in no manner
To tell each thing unto their registrere
Thing openly don or thing that was secre
Of adventure as between tweyne
Or any quarrel take of volunte
Truly report and platly not to feyne
Them to be sworn the statute did ordeyne
Not conseled of worship nor of shame
To be regestryd report the silf same
And to conclude the statute has us leryd
Every quarrel groundyd on honestye
In that court what knight was requeryd
In the diffence of troth and equite
Falshede excluded and duplycite
Shall ay be ready to sustene that party
His life his body to put in Iupartye
Thus in bretayn shone the clear light
Of chyualrye and of hye prowess
Which through the world shad his bemys bright
Well of worship condute of all nobles
Imperial court all wrongs to repress
Head spring of honor of largess cheef sisterne
Myrroure of manhood of noblesse the lantern
Yet was there seyne never so bright a son
The somerys day in the mydday spear
So fresshly shine but su^me skies done
Might percas curtayne his bemys clear
Often it fails when fortune makes best chere
And falsely smyleth in her double wede
Folk seyn expert than is she most to dread
Thus when the name of the worthy king
Was ferthest sprad by report of memory
In every realm his nobles most shynynge
All his emprises concludinge on victory
This double goddess enuyed at his glory
And cast menys by su^me manner train
To clypse the light of knyghthode in bretayne
Thus while arthure stood most honorable
In his estate flouringe in his age
Among his knights of the round table
Highest of princes on fortunes stage
The Romans sent to him for truage
Began make a cleyme froward and outrageous
Taking their title of Caesar Julius
The same time this mighty king arthur
Conquered had Gaul and also france
Outrayed Frolle like a coqueroure
Brought paris under obeysaunce
Took them to grace and with his ordinance
Gate all Aungoy / Angorys / and Gascoyne
Peytowe / Nauerne / Barry / and burgoyne
Cesyd not but did his besy pain
^
Gate all the land of peyters and toureyne
Their cytees yolde to him they did homage
To be rebel they found none advantage
Soiourned in france as seith the cronyclere
Held possession the space of nine year
Held a feast full solemn at paris
All the cuntrees which he gate in france
Like a prince full prudent and wys
Which had of fredom full royal suffisaunce
Of all his conquest the cuntrees in substance
For his princis and barons so provided
Like their deserts he has them dyuyded
To his Senescall that called was kay
Aungoyne and main he gave all the party
To his butler was made no delay
Called bedwere he gave Normandye
To a baron nigh cosyn of allye
A manly knight which named was berell
Gave the duchye of burgoyne euerydell
Thus he departed lordshippes of that land
There he thought was most expedient
Su^me he reserved in his own hand
Ageyn to bretayne returned of entente
Sent out writtes held a great perlement
After which he made a feast anon
In the cuntre called glowmorgon
At a great cite called carlion
As is remembryd by writings
Came many a prince and many a fressh baron
In noumbre I find that there were x kings
Ready to obey arthur in all things
Present also as was well seen
There of earls rekened full thrittene
All the knights of the round table
Feste of pentecoste as fest principal
Many estates famous and honorable
Of princes barons born of the blood royal
Were present there and in especial
All that were by oath and promise bound

In purpos fully arthur to encombre
At which arryuayle slain was Gaweyne
Cosyn to arthur a noble knight certain
Eke Agnysell was slain on the stronde
King of Scottys or he came to land
Maugre mordrede arthur did arryue
The ground recured like a manly knight
For fere of whom anon after blyue
The said mordrede took him to the flight
Toward london took his wey right
The gates shet and kept was the cite
Ageyn mordrede he might have none enter
In all have to Cornwayle he fled
The sword of arthur he durst not abide
Lest he should lay his life to wed
Yet for him silf thus he began provide
With multitude gadred on his side
Put lif and death that day on adventure
That day to dye or the feeld recure
In fortune there may be no certain
Upon whose whele all bro^lenes is founded
Mordrede that day in the field was slain
And noble arthur to the death was wounded
By the which the feeld of bretons was confound
Of so great slaughter and good knights lo ^n
Upon a day men have not seen beforn
After the battle arthur for a while
To staunch his wounds and hurtys to recure
Borne in a letre came to an I Will
Called aualon and there of adventure
As the said gaufryde records by scripture
How king arthur flower of chyualrye
F^^ with his knights and lives yet in fairye
Thus of bretayn translated was the son
Up to the rich sterry bright dongeon
Astronomers well reherce konne
Called arthures constellocyon
Where he sit crouned in the heavenly mancion
Amyd the paleys of stones cristallyne
Told among christian of the worthy nine
This error abides yet among britons
Which founded is upon the prophesye
Of old marlyn like their opinion
He as a king is crownyd in fairie
With s^^^tr^ and sword and with his regalye
Shall resort as lord and soueraygne
Out of fair and regne in bretayne
And repair again the round table
By prophesye of merlyn set the date
Among princys king incomperable
His sete ageyn to carlyon to translate
The par^^as sustern sponne so his fate
His Epitaphie records so certain
Here lies king arthur that shall regne ageyn
Unto bochas I will return ageyn
Before reherced parcel of his prowess
Thereon to abide me list no more soiourne
But to remember the great unkindness
The conspiracion the treson the falsnesse
Done to king arthure by his cosyn mordrede
Make a Lenuoy that men all may it read
Lenuoye.
THis tragedye of arthur here following
Bid princes all beware of falls treson
For in all earth is none so perilous thing
As trust of feyth where is decepcion
Hyd under curteyn of falls collusion
For which men should I hold the counsel good
Beware aforne ever of unkind blood
The world diverse fortune ay chaungeable
In every cuntre and every region
In a strayte need few friends abiding
Long abstynence causes dissencion
And if princes by falls dyuysion
Nigh of allye show two faces in an hode
Late men beware ever of unkind blood
Who was more hardy of princes here regnynge
Or more famous of marcyall renoun
Than whilom was his enmyes outraynge
Arthur cheef son of brutus albion
But for all that the disposycion
Of fate and fortune most furious and wode
Caused his destruction by unkind blood
What more contrarious to nature in showing
Than fair pretense double of entencion
Great allyaunces frowardly werkinge
Hid under flowers a serpent cast poison
Bright silver scalyd damageth the dragon
Each worm some party tar^ageth of his broad
And what more perilous ^han unkind blood
Noble princys on arthur remembrynge
Deem the day of phoebus going down
All is not gold that is clear shynynge
Before provided of your inward reason
Falls vndermynynge and supplantacion
Remembrynge aye with arthur how it stood
By conspyracion of unkind blood
An Exclamacion of Bochas ageyn kynredes unkind.
gEyn kinredes and unkind alliaunces
Bochas makes here an exclamacion
Upon mordrede which with his ordynau^ces
Caused of arthur fynall distruccion
The same eclipsinge of Brutus albion
Not withstandinge plainly to descryue
He trusted him above all men alyu^
It is a merueyle and uncouth to deuyse
By what occasion or by what courage
That a man should in any manner wise
Be found unkind unto his lynage
Hateful to god that in any age
Blood ageyn blood born of one kynrede
Conspyre should of malice and hatrede
In this matter it were but vayn to tarry
The story know of arthur and mordrede
By blood allied in werkinge most contrary
Which made many breton knight to blede
For by usurping conspyrynge and falshede
Of the said mordrede most unfortunate
Caused all breteyn stand desolate
First dissolate by abcens of their king
Callde in his time of kings most notable
The desolacion of knights abydinge
Whilom in breteyn famous and honorable
Brethren echon of the round table
The which by mordrede the false forsworn knight
Stood long eclipsed and derkyd of his light
The light of noblesse that shone through all breteyn
By falls mordrede was dyrked of his bemys
The monarchy departed was on tweyne
That stood first one with his marciall stremes
But afterward the brightness of his bemys
Drough to declyne by falls dyuision
Which has destroyed full many a region
All the process upon a duplycyte
Plainly concludes and that is blood unkind
Adue welfare and all prosperity
There pees and concord be left behind
Trees may not thryue departed fro the rynde
A pleyn exaumple in arthur and mordrede
Who can conceive and list the story read
Of Geseuye king of Venandre / and of three other kings / and how they were
destroyed.
AFter all these strange uncouth things
Tofore John bochas as made is mention
There came tofore him four mighty kings
For to compleyn their desolacion
First Ges^uye king of the region
Called venandre in werres full contrayre
Unto a prince called belisayre
And to this said noble belysayre
Full renomed that time in chiualrye
The King of goths was also aduersarye
And both atonys of hatrede and envy
Assentyd fully to hold champertye
Geyn belisaire which through his hye renoun
Took them both and cast them in prison
There is no more of them in bochas found
But after them in order by writing
Came amarales with many blody wound
Which in his time was of mawres king
Without cause or title of any thing
Upon Jane Sangwyn began werrey ageyn right
Which through all affryk was one the best knight
The said Jane armyd in plate and mayle
Met amarales in Affrik on a sonde
And held with him a mighty strong battle
And like a knight slough him with his hand
Drove all his people proudly fro that land
And in my book there is none other mind
To be remembered of him that I can find
Than synduall of breton lord and king
Tofore bochas put him silf in prees
Began show his mischeef pitously wepinge
When he held werre wylfull and recheles
Ageyn a prince called Narsates
A romayne knight fers hardy and right strong
In his diffence when men would do him wrong
This Narsates of cas or adventure
Though he in deed was a manly knight
He failed members in soth of engend^ure
His aduarsaries echon he put to the flight
Took their king and furthwith anon right
As the cronycle pleynly does record
On hye galowes he henge him with a cord
Of Narsates after this victory
King Totila had full great dysdeyne
With a great oste most pompous in his glory
Came upon him and met him in a plain
With multitude though he were ouerleyne
Torninge Totyla which many man beheld
Of narsates was slain in the field
In order next Bochas does write
Of Gepedoys how king Trusmonde
Required him that he would endyte
The great aduersytees in which he did habounde
And of his daughter called Rosamonde
The unhappy chance to make and discryue
To whom fortune was contrary all her live
Albonyus king of lumbardye
With many a land held in subjection
Conquered Beeme / Prage / and Hungerye
The land of Gepedoys with many a region
Faught with their king as made is mention
Slough in battle the said Trusmonde
Weddyd after his daughter rosamonde
^yn auctoure greatly commends the beauty
And writes also she was but young of age
Whoos story first when I did see
How ungracious also was her marriage
I began wex pale in my visage
Greatly astonyed confus of very shame
To write the story in hindringe of her name
I will forbere and lightly pass here
The surplusage lightly ouerpasse
For by and by to tell all the manner
Of felonyes that did in hertys brace
(...) should blot this book and eke difface
For which I cast truly and not fail
Touching her storye to make rehersayle
How Albonyus was murdryd by his wife and how she after most vicious was
murd^yd also.
King Albonoys as ye shall understand
After many conquest and victory
Which he had both in see and land
To put his triumphs in memory
Let cry a feast to his encres of glory
At which feste solemn and princypall
So as he sat in his estate royal
Parcel for pride parcel for gladness
The queen present the said Rosamonde
Take and supprysed he was with dronkenesse
Of mighty wynes which that day did habounde
Sent a Gobelet of gold as it is found
Unto the queen with licoure full plesaunt
Bad to her fadre she should drink a taunte
She dempt it was a manner mokerye
First her name and worship to confound
To bid her drink ataunt for her party
To her fadre this said trusmonde
Slain aforn with many blody wound
By Albanyus through his unhappy chance
Of which rebuke she cast to do vengeance
She bare the rancoure full long in her entente
Which day by day began renew and encrees
A certain squire she made of her assent
To accomplissh she would never cees
And on another squire she began prees
Called perdyus accordyd all in one
This false murdre to execute anon
The day was set while he lay a sleep
Fill upon him with sharp swerdes ground
Her lord was slain alas he took no keep
Or he dyed of fortune he has found
A speres head to a tronchon bound
Him silf defendynde in that mortal stryf
But slain he was by treson of his wife
After this murdre to escape fro daungere
This Rosamonde fled away by night
With her went melchys her squyere
Took a ship sailed by sterre light
To Rauenne they took the way right
Lad with them for refute and socour
Of albonyus all the hole tresoure
After she was weddyd to melchis
Man of this world stood most in her grace
Her love appalled set of him no prys
For she not could be content in one place
Her joy was ever new thing to purchase
To assay many never plesed with one
Till by experyence she preuyd had echone
Provost of rauenne and cheef gouernoure
For the excellence of her great beauty
Above all wymen loved her peramoure
When she entered first that cite
And through her fraud and duplicite
She cast murdre in her froward auys
Her new husbonde that called was melchys
The hot somer in lusty fressh may
The same melchis for hete and werynesse
Him silf to bath went a certain day
Caught a great thurst of fayntnes in sothnesse
And rosamonde of infernal falsnesse
Took a gobelet with lycoure great foyson
Gave him drink wine medlyd with poison
He drank up half and therwithall he began
Breest and belly to swell and to arise
Intoxigat wex dedely pale and wan
And when he did her treson advertise
He made her drink in the same wise
Maugre her will she might it not restrain
Guyrdon for murdre they dyed both tweyne
In this chaptre but little fruit I find
Save only this to put in remembrance
That should call ageyn to mind
Murdre before god requires ay vengeance
This funeral story weyed in balaunce
Wrought by melchis compassyd first and found
By falls treson of cursed rosamonde
Slough first her lord albonyus as I said
Tweyne of her squyers did execucion
Out of his sleep when he did abrayde
Let country (...)
Each murdryd other by drinking of poison
Melchis drank first and next drank Rosamonde
At them it began and to them it did rebounde
Countrepeysyd one murdre for an other
Albonyus slain by rosamonde his wife
By assent of melchys and after each to other
The poison partyd there began a fatal stryf
Murdre quyt for murdre they both lost their life
Who with falsnes full well afferme I dare
Shall with falness^ be quyt or he be ware
As they departed such part again they took
As men deserve such shall be their mede
This froward storye end of the eight book
Of Rosamonde and melchis wrought in deed
For short conclusion byddeth men take heed
They shall ageynwarde resceyue such mesoure
As they mesure unto their neightboure
Explicit Liber Octauus.
Incipit Liber Nonus How the emperor Mauricius / his wif and his children
were slain at Calcedonie
tO frauncis petrak as bochas vndretoke
In eschewynge of sloth and Idleness
As he began accomplissh upon his book
Assurance made to do his business
Which thing remembryd began his pen dress
The nynth book so god would send him grace
It to perform if he had life and space
At the gynnynge sothly of his labor
In his stody to him there did appear
Mauricius the mighty emperor
Which complained rehersynge the manner
How he by phocas cruel of look and chere
Distroyed was wife children and kinrede
The slaughtre couthe who list the story read
The seyde mauryce as write bochas John
Was by Phocas brought to destruction
His wif his children slain euerichon
At calcedonye as made is mention
After whoos death he took possession
The said phocas as put is in memory
Gave panteon to seint gregory
Which was a temple of old fundacion
Full of Idols up set on hye stages
There through the world of every nation
Were of their gods set up great Images
To every kyngdon dyrect were their visages
As poetis and fulgeus by his live
In books old pleynly does descryue
Euerich Image had in his hand a bell
As perteyneth to every nation
Which by craft some tokyn should tell
When any kingdom fill in rebellyon
Or began malygne ageyn rome town
Which to redress with strong and mighty hand
Sent a prince to chastise all that land
The said temple bylded of lyme and stone
(...) my face as books specefye
(...) it was first called pantyon
Set up crosses upon each party
Halowyd it to marters and to marye
Year by year gynnynge of nouembre
The feste hold the martylege does remember
In asia this emperor mauryce was slain
In the cite that called is calcydonye
All his household and many good romayn
By phocas and perciens as had is in memory
And phocas after for his vaynglorie
Slain by Eraclyus he than was emperor
Four and twenty winter and cheef gouernoure
Of machomete the false prophet and how he being drunk was devoured among
swyne.
AFter the death of phocas as I told
That Eraclyus to regne first began
Came machomet in his time I hold
A falls prophet and a magician
^
Born in Arabya but of low kinrede
All his live worshypped Idols in deed
And when that he grue in to great age
Dysceyuable in many sundry wyses
With camels used first carriage
Falls and double subtle in his dyuyses
Went to egypt fet myrchaundyses
To Jews and christian sundry times sent
Learned the old and the new testament
As books old record in that party
This machomet this cu^syd f^ls man
Out of Egypt fast began him hye
Toward a cuntre called Corezan
With a lady that hight cardycan
Through his subtle falls dalyaunce
By craft he fill into her acquaintance
He wrought by his enchauntementys
And by falls menys of nygromancys
Her enclynynge toward his en^entes
For both he could flater well and lie
Said opynly that he was messie
Iewys abiding upon his coming
As gre^test prophe^e and their souereyn king
Thus the people he brought in great error
By his techynge and his false doctrine
He wexe among them a great gouernoure
The said lady also he did enclyne
As to a prephete which that was dyuyne
Sent from above as she did understand
For which she took him to her husbonde
His lynage began at Hysmaell
Had a sickness full often since fill down
In his excuse said that gabryell
Was sent to him fro the heuynly mancion
By the holy ghost to his Instruction
And for the angel showed him silf so shene
To stand upright he might not sustene
On his shuldre were often times seyn
When he to folk showed his presence
Milk white doves which that pickyd greyn
Out of his erys affermynge in sentence
They came by grace of gostly influence
Him to visit to show and specefye
He was the prophet that called was messye
New laws also he did ordeyne
Showed signs by falls appearance
Iike moses him silf he did feyne
A prophet of most excellence
And thereupon to show an euydence
Small pottes with milk and honey borne
On a great Bole were hangyd on each horn
He made the temple give credulyte
To his doctrine and froward techynge
By milk and honey fygured was plente
By the merit of his goostly werkynge
And thus he was at his beginning
Take of sarazyns as they began to him draw
Which by falls error bound them to his law
A Clerk of his called Sergius
Wrote his laws and these miracles three
First of these doves how they came to him thus
As here toforne reherced was by me
How milk and honey were tokne of great plente
And of the bole before by craft made tame
By falls disceytes to get him a name
Of Arabyens and sarazyns I as read
And of Turks made prince and governor
With Hismaelitis and folk of perce and mede
He gadred people began wex a werrour
Ageyn Eraclius the mighty emperor
And usurped to ride in the cuntrees
Gate alisaundre with many mo citees
Of tho parties desirous to be king
Of that purpose when he was set aside
The people falsely dissimulynge
Told he was sent prophets to provide
For tho cuntres for to be their gyde
And for he was lecherous of courage
He made of venus to set up an Image
Made sarazyns to worship the friday
Semblably his story does express
So as the Jews hallowed the saturday
All his works concludynge in falsnes
When he drank wine fill in dronknesse
To the people like a falls prophet
To drink water and good wine to let
As I said the heretyk Sergyus
With him of counsel froward and contrary
Fone to cure feith he and Nostoryus
From holy church greatly they began varye
On whose errors bochas list not tarry
More to write of this machomete
A nygromancian and a falls prophet
Who list to se his laws euerichon
You to sarazyns his book can bear witness
As they be set in his Alkeron
Echon in order groundyd on falsnes
Like a gloton dyed on dronkenes
By exces of drinking much wine
Fill in a podell devoured among swyne
This was the end of falls machomete
For all his crafts of nygromancy
The funeral fine of this said prophet
Dronlewe of kind called him silf Messie
Whom sarazyns so greatly magnefye
John bochas let be for a queen of france
More of his error to put in remembrance
How Brounchilde queen of france slough her kyn / brought the Land in
dyuysyon / and after was hangyd / and hewn in pecys small
sHe came arrayed nothing like a queen
Her here vntressyd bochas took good head
In all his book he had before not seen
Amore woeful creature in deed
With weeping iyen to torn was all her wede
Rebukyng bochas he had left behind
Her wretchidnesse for to put in mind
Unto mine auctoure suddenly she abrayde
Like a woman that were with woe chekmate
First of all thus to him she said
Sumtyme I was a queen of great estate
Crowned in France but now all disolate
I stood for soth brounchyld was my name
Which to reherce I have a manner shame
Thou were besy to write the woeful cas
Within thy book of arcynoe
Dydest service to queen cleopatras
Of Rosamunde thou wrote also parde
And among all thou have forgoten me
Whereby it seems thou do at me disdeyne
List no parcel to write of my pain
When bochas herd this of chere he wex sa^
Knowing no thing of that she did endure
I wisse quod he before I have not rad
In no cronycle nor in no scripture
Of your froward woeful adventure
No quod she I pray you take good head
So as they fill I will reherce in deed
Bochas with brounchylde began debate anon
Sothly quod he this is the condicyon
Of you wymen almoost euerychon
Ye have this manner without excepcion
Of your natural inclynacion
Of your declarynge this obseruaunce to keep
No thing to say contrary to your worship
Nature has taught you all that is wrong ^excuse
Under a curtayne al thing for to hyde
With little grain your chaf ye can abuse
On your defautys ye list not for to abide
The gaul touchid all that ye set aside
Show ro^ys fressh wedys ye let pas
And fairest chere there ye ^oste trespass
And if ye shall tell your own tale
How ye fall fro fortunes whele
Ye will unclose but a little male
Show of your vices but a small parcele
Bro^le glass shows brighter than stele
And though of virtue ye show a fair pretense
He is a fool that yeueth to you credence
Quod brounchy^ (...) do right well espy
Thou have of w^ a falls opinion
How they can fla^ ^le and lie
And ben diverse of disposycion
Thou might have made an excepcion
Of hye estatys and them that gentle been
Namely of me that was so great a queen
Your hye estate by kind has no power
To change in nature nouther cold nor hete
But late us pass and leave this matter
Thereon to abide or any more to plete
Of your complaynt say to me the great
By way of service to you I shall me quyte
As ye declare take my pen and write
Take heed quod she and with good auyce
Fro the troth bewar that thou ne varye
Whilom in france regnyd king Clowyce
Had a son that named was Clotarye
Clothar an he^^e that name^ was Lotar^
And this lotarie named the second
Had sonnys four in storye it is found
To the cronycle who can take heed
As it is put in remembrance
When their fadre the mighty king was deed
Atwene these four was partyd all france
Each by him silf to have governance
By one assent as brother unto brother
Weringe their crowns each quyt them unto other
The same time I called brounchilde
Me list not varye from the old writynge
Had a fadre named leuechylde
Of all spain souereyne lord and king
My said fader to full great hindrynge
Of both realmys the fame ran so far
Twene spain and france began a mortal werre
The brethern four in france crowned kings
Again my fadre made strong diffence
Of marciall pride and fortunat chaunges
When they met by mortal violence
Of sodeyne sl^ughter fill such p^^^^lence
On outher party the field like a great flode
With the terryble effusion of blood
To both realms the werres were importable
Causinge of death passing great damage
Sought menys wex by assent tretable
Of blood shedynge to appese the woeful rage
By oon accord I was you in marriage
To Sigebert regnynge tho in france
Twene both realms to make allyaunce
Nay quod bochas I deem it was not so
Twene you and me there must begin a stryf
Be aduysed take good head thereto
The first assurance of marriage in your lif
Of chylperyk ye were the weddyd wife
Chronicles seyn what ever ye express
In this matter will bear with me witness
Though su^me books reherce and so seyn
Like as ye have made here mention
Their rehesayle stand in no certain
For by the assent of outher region
Spain and france in their conuencion
Ordained so in my tender age
To sygebert I was give in marriage
Imeneus was not there present
When we ^^er our chaumbre toward night
For thesyphone her sustren of assent
Infernal goddesses bare the torchys light
And as the torches showed derke and bright
Thereby the people presentyd one and all
Dempt of the marriage what should befall
This custom used of antyquyte
From their temples of goddys and goddesses
At marriages of folk of hye degree
Torches were borne of whom men took wytnes
As they were derke or showed their brightness
The difference seen in each estate
If it were toward or Unfortunate
Of this marriage short process to make
The torches burnt and yet they were not bright
Showed out combrous smokes blake
Of consolacion lost was all the light
Thus in derknes wasted the first night
Their verse their song of goddys and goddesses
Were all togedre of sorrow and heaviness
These were the toknes the night of marriage
Pronostykes of great aduersite
Yet of nature I had this advantage
Of womanhede and excellent beute
And like a queen in stones and perre
I was arrayed clad in purple wede
With a crown of gold upon my head
Selempnely crownyd queen of france
Which for to se folk fast began repair
Of all welfare I had suffisaunce
Clombe upon fortune full hye upon the stayre
A son I had called clotayre
By Sygebert by record of writynge
Third of that name in france crowned king
So would god that day that he was borne
He had be put in his sepulture
In salvation of blood shed here toforne
Caused the death of many creature
As diverse books report in scripture
Ground and gynnynge as made is mention
Within this land of great dyuision
He with his brethern of whom I spoke late
At him began the first occasion
Not so quod bochas ye failed of your date
Who was cheef cause of dyuysion
Sothly quod she in mine opinion
Among them silf I dare well specefye
Cheef gynnynge was fraternall envy
Keep you more cloos in this matter ye do fail
Following the traces of your condition
Ye hal^ foul in your rehersayle
For of your own ymagynacion
Ye ^ewe the sede of this dissencion
Among these kings if ye take heed
By which in france many man was deed
Than brounchyld began to change chere
To bochas said with face full cruel
Not long agon thou knew not the manner
Of my living but a small parcel
Me seems now thou know euerydell
So that ye may without longer stryf
Sit as Judge that knows so will my life
When these brethern stood at discord
Each ageyn other by mortal violence
Under a color to trete of accord
With many a manner feyned diligence
Chilperyk there being in presence
Whilom brother to Sygebert the king
Was slain among them by falls conspiringe
On whoos death auengyd for to be
As Sigebert did him silf auaunce
Among the prees he slain was parde
Not so quod bochas but of falls governance
Of your misliuynge fill this unhappy chance
That sygebert was murdryd in sothnes
Only by occasion of your doublenes
Following the traces of new fangylnes
Geyn Sygebert he wrought full falsely
When ye loved of froward doublenes
Laudryk the Earl of chaumpayn and of bry
For by your outrage and your great folly
The king was slain and ye did assent
In a forest an hunting when he went
Which called was the forest of compyne
Alas quod she and brake out in compleynynge
Bochas bochas thou do sore undermine
All the surfetys done in my living
Thou know the slaughtre of sygebert the king
Which that was wrought alas by mine assent
How knowist thou and were not there present
Of these debates and of all the werre
With rebukes rehercyd here in vayn
In rehersayle greatly thou doyst err
For I cast be right well certain
In my diffence to replye ageyn
It was not I she that thou do mean
It was Fregundys the lusty young queen
This Fregundis thou shall understand
Right womanly and fair of her visage
Chilperyk was whylon her husbond
For her beutye took her in marriage
By her treynys and her great outrage
He was after the story who list read
At mischeef slain thou shalt so find in deed
Though ye by langage make strong diffence
In these matters which cause me to muse
I have ageyn you lost my patience
That so subtylly would your silf excuse
Contrariously your treynes ye abuse
For Colotayre I have so rad parde
Was not engendered of Sigebert nor of the
I Remember full well that I have rad
That Chilperyk though ye thereat disdeyne
Record of auctours that prudent be and sad
He in troth was gendryd of you tweyne
Which in his dyenge me list not for to seyne
Left sons two the story ye may read
Theobart and Thederyk to succeed
Bochas quod she though thou turn vpsodoun
The said stories reherced here in deed
Following the malice of thyn opinion
Maugre thy will forth I will proceed
As I began take thereto good head
The first Thederyk thou shall understand
Cosyn Germayn was to my husbonde
King of burgoyn that time and another
He of hatrede and indignacion
Slough Theobart which that was his brother
His wife his children for short conclusion
Which in the mighty famous region
Of Antrasie reigned as lord and king
What ever thou say this troth and no lesinge
Nay nay quod bochas it was all otherwise
I may not suffer how ye go there among
All this langage of new that ye dyuyse
Brought to a preef concludes upon wrong
What should we ^eng^e this ma^e^ ^^awe alonge
Your silf were cause where ye be loath or feign
By theodoryk the theobarte was slain
The ground hereof began percell of envy
By your froward brennynge couetyse
Which had only to occupye
To rule the land after your own guyse
And if I shall pleynly here deuyse
Of these myscheues reherced god do bote
Ye were your silf ground cheef croppe and rote
Quod brounchylde I conceive well and se
Ye for your pertye have lost all reverence
Your silf enarmed to show your cruelte
Ageyns me touching the violence
Of two slaughtres rehercyd in sentence
First how thederyk his brother slough in deed
Called Theobart a pitous thing to read
Him silf after stranglyd with poison
His wife his children hew in pesys small
As ye quod bochas make here mention
Some part is true but not all your tale
For I suppose ye should wax pale
For shame of thing which ye can not excuse
When Thedoryk begins you to accuse
He put on you the crime of falls treson
Ye slough his wife and children also
Him silf also ye murdered by poison
I would wete what ye could say herto
Alas quod she what should I do
Was never woman in hye nor low estate
All thing consydred more unfortunate
Fortune of me set now but little prys
By her froward furious violence
Turnynge her whele and visage of malice
Causes to me that noman yeueth credence
Had in despite void of reverence
And fortunes mutabilite
Sool adiect and fall in pouerte
O Bochas John for short conclusion
Thou may again me thy style now auaunce
I have deserved to have punycion
And all the princes and barons now in france
Cry out on me and ask auengeaunce
Refuge is none nor recure in this thing
Though yt with Clotaire my soul be crowned king
For my diffautes foul and abhomyneble
Tofore the iuges of all the perlement
I was forniggyd and found also coupable
Of every crime conuyct by Judgment
Mine accusours there being present
Of one and other stondynge a great route
Markyd with fingers of folk that stood about
For very shame I did mine ien close
For them that gaured and cast on me their sight
But as folk may by toknes well suppose
Mine eres were not stopped half aright
Taken by force lad forth by might
By the hangman draw over hill and vale
Dismembryd after and hew on pesys small
With my blood the pament all bespreynte
Thanked be fortune which was mine adventure
The soul partyd the body was so feynt
Who rad ever of any creature
That much more torment did endure
Prayde bochas to have all thing in mind
Write her life and leave no thing behind
Lenuoye.
This tragedye of brounchilde the queen
Look her story who list give attendaunce
Froward to read contageous to seen
And contrary to all good governance
Born in spain crownyd queen of france
Double of tongue up sin der of treson
Caused all that land stand at dyuision
From her traynes there could noman fleen
Sours and head spring of sorrow and myschaunce.
Shed honey first stange after as do been
Her myrre medlyd with sugared falls plesaunce
What she said encluded in variaunce
Maistresse of murdre and of dissencion
Caused all that loud stand at diuisyon
Pryncys of gaul might not sustene
Great outrages nor the great greuaunce
Nor the surfetys done in their yerys grene
Brought that kingdom almoost to vttraunce
All of assente cried on her vengeance
The same aros how all that region
In her falsnesse stood at dyuysion
The knif of murdre ground was so kene
By her malice of long contynuaunce
Her courage fret with infernal tene
Spared nouther (...) no^ allyaunce
Peys^d her su^fetys and weyed in balaunce
As bochas write she was the occasion
Which made all france to stand at dyuision
Bochas marueyleth of the malice and cruelte of ^rounchilde writes thus
BOchas astonyed began inwardly maruayle
Fill in a manner ambyguyte
Of brounchildes merueylous rehersayle
How any woman of reason should be
So full of malice and of cruelte
To sle her kyn and set at distaunce
By division all the realm of france
Bochas dempt it was not credyble
That a woman should be so vengeable
In her malice so venymous and terrible
Of slaughter and murdre to be coupable
The storye suspecte held it but a fable
Only exepte that she did him exite
With great instaunce her story for to write
Her cry on bochas was very importune
To set in order her felicitees
With her unhappy chaunges of fortune
Her disclaundres great aduersytees
With her diffame reportyd by cuntrees
No very ground found in books old
But of confession that she her silf told
That mine auctoure rehereyd with solemn style
Reherce should her words disclaundrous
Her flourynge years also for to compyle
Medlyd with her days that were contrarious
Her fatal end froward and furious
Whereof encoumbryd of very werinesse
Toward Eraclius he began his pen dress
How Eraclius the Emperor sustained heresye / fill in to dropsye / and
sickness incurable / and so dyed.
aFter Phoras with great honor and glo^ye
Crowned emperor of rome the cite
In whose time as seith the storye
The Romans stood in great perplexite
By them of perce that roos with Cosdr^ye
Which took upon him to be lord and sire
As a tyraunte to trouble the empire
Gate many prouynce and many famous reem
Through all asye as the cronicle seith
Began approach toward Ierusaleem
Before the town proudly a syege he leithe
As a tyrant froward to cristys feith
But eraclyus maugre all his might
Smet of his head and slough him like a knight
And by grace which that is dyuyne
This famous prince this Eraclyus
In his beginning slough many proud sersyn^
Hold in tho days notable and glorious
And in his conquest passing famous
Diverse relykes of the cross he sought
And from tho cuntrees many of them he brought
Was none so f^ hold in his dyees
As Eraclyus (...) Empire for to guye
Nor more manly found at all assayes
Of hye prowes ^or in chiualrye
But when he began sustain heresye
God took from him within a little space
His hap and welfare his fortune and his grace
He began sustene and follow certain rytes
Of wylfulnesse and froward fantasye
Of a sect called Monachelitys
Which as a s^^te of froward heresye
And since that he drough to that party
The story tells for all his high estate
This Eraclyus was never fortunate
Where he was first drad on se and land
Namely of sarasyns for all his chiualrys
Grace and fortune from him withdroughe her hand
For when he fill into heresye
He was trauayled with such a dropsye
That ^herwithall he had a froward lust
Ever to drink and ever he was a thurst
In tho days found was no leche
Albe that they were sought on each party
The said prince that could wyssh or teache
Him to releue of his dropsye
Made feynt and feeble with a great palesye
Thus in sekenes he has his days spent
By vengeance slain with infernal torment
Of Eraclyus this was the woeful end
As is rehercyd slain with sickness
Out of this world when he should wend
All hole the empire stood in great distress
Fors of sarasyns did them so oppress
And day by day drough to declyne
By his son called constantyne
How Constantyne the son of Eraclyus supporting error / and heresye / was
murdered in a stewe
wHich was his successor as made is mention
In whose time through his great folly
Sarazyns did great oppression
Spoylynge the cuntres of all lumbardye
And Constantyne of wylfull slogardye
Wastyd his days till he has brought
All the Empire almost to naught
Geyn cristes feith in especial
He began of malice his wyttys to apply
And was thereto enmy full mortal
And cheef supportoure of falls heresye
And toward rome fast he began him hye
Spoiled temples of many rich image
And by water after took his passage
To constantynople fast he began him hye
By cesyle the way was almost mete
At Syracuse I find that he did aryue
And for the ceson was excessyf of hete
Which in his labor made him for to sweet
And secretly he began him silf remue
To be bathed in a preuy stue
Of envy there he was espied
His own knights like as it is found
By conspyracion certain of them allied
Fill upon him with sharp swerdys ground
And mercyles with many mortal wound
They slough him there on him they were so wode
Amyd the stewe naked as he stood
After whoos death they did them silf audunce
To chese a knight born in armenye
Of the empire took the governance
And to supporte falsely their empire
But Constantyne succedinge of allye
Being next heir the troth for to sue
To him that was murdryd in the stewe
Called Constantyne as his fader was
Right notable in actys marcyall
More wisely governed stood in other caas
Like a prince by judgment royal
Of manly heart and courage natural
The conspiratours first of all he sleth
That were assentyd to his fadres death
To great encrees of his famous renoun
Grace of god did him enlumyne
Constantynoble in that royal town
Old heresye to cese and to fine
Two hundred busshoppes eke also nine
He made assemble to stand at diffence
Of cristys feyth of manly prouydence
He was eke besy churches to restore
All heretics manly to withstonde
Their opynyons examyned well before
And when the troth was well vndrestonde
Like cristys knight list for no man wond^
To punyssh them justly by rigor
Without excepcion of person or favor
Of him in bochas little more I read
Nor of his empire I find non other date
Spared none heretics nouther for gold nor mede
At constantynople he passed in to fate
When bulgarence began with him debate
A froward people wylfull and recheles
Gave them a tribute for to live in pees
How Gisulphus was slain and his wife endyd mischeuously in lecherye.
NExt came Gysulphus to bochas on the ringe
A famous duke and notable in his lif
With weeping iyen pytously playnynge
With whom also came rymulde his wif
Which that lived ever in sorrow and stryf
Yet was she both of birth and of lynage
Right excellent and fair of her visage
Six children had this famous queen
By Gysulphus gotten in marriage
Wonder semely and goodly unto seen
And fortunat by process of their age
Albe their fadre felt great damage
By the werres he had in his living
With Gathamus that was of Narcys king
This cathamus with many strong battle
Is descendyd and take the way right
Of Duke Gysulphus the lands ta assail
Togedre met in steel armyd bright
Gysulphus slain his people put to flight
And cathamus with strong and mighty hand
Took possession conquered all his land
After whoos death Rymulde the duches
Greatly astonyed pale of her visage
To the castle of Forgoyll began her dress
With her knights of strong and fell courage
Cathamus made after his passage
Laid a syege cast him to Iupart
His life / his body rather than depart
About the castle armyd as he stood
Like a prince sat knightly on his stead
Upon the walls as rimuldus abode
Fresshly beseen in her purple wede
And of the syege began to take heed
Her look unwarily as she cast aside
And saw the king before the castle ride
So like a prince and a manly knight
She began on him look wonder narowe
The god of love perced through her sight
Unto her heart merkyd with his arowe
Made the soil so plyaunt of her thought
That of her castle she set almoost rightnought
And for to accomplissh the hole entencion
Of her falls lust in any manner thing
She is agreed by disposion
To yield the castle in have unto the king
She for to come without more taryenge
Like a duke / a duchess her silf to present
Where as the king sat armed in his tent
The people within prisoners take
Her four sons took them to the flight
Love caused that she has forsake
Her blood her kyn where it were wrong or right
And rymulde the space of all a night
With Cathamus had all her delight
And ever after he had her in despyte
And by the king when she was refused
Twelve in nombre that dwelled in his house
Most frowardly her beutye has abused
Of her nature she was so lecherous
And to reherce it is contageous
How she wexe after so abhomynable
To be aqueyntyd with gromes of the stable
It were but vayn to tarry on this matere
Or any long process for to make
Her storye is contageous for to here
But finally at myscheef she was take
For a spectacle fetchyd on a stake
Set up aloft mine auctour tells so
Dyed in distres for constraynt of her woe
Of Iustynyan the false extorcyoner / exyled by patricyan / after both nose and
iyen but from his head.
By exaumple so as fressh armure
Through long resting leseth his brightness
Fret with old rust gadreth great ordure
Is diffaced of his fressh clerenesse
Semblably the romans hye prowess
Began for to appall alas and that was routh
When they gave to negligence and sloth
Who in kinghode list have experience
Must eschew riotous Idleness
By prudent and enteer dyligence
Large with discrecion manly with gentylnesse
To high empryses his courage dress
And he well ware on each party
Him to preserve from all slogardye
The which greatly has appeyred
As it is remembered of old antiquyte
Caused romans to be despeyred
By froward lusts hyndred their cite
And appalled their old prosperity
Of which defautys came to pleyn blyue
To John bochas emperors five
As many kings of the same noumbre
Which by sloth were before oppressed
Whom that sloth whilom did encombre
Their names by and by here expressed
To mine auctour they have their course dressyd
Like their degrees to speak in wordys few
Iustynyan first began his face show
Not Iustynyan whilom so virtuous
And of prudent governance so notable
But Iustynyan Temerarius
Double of his dedys falls and desceyuable
Of his promys diverse and unstable
Whilom exiled by patrician
For extorcions that he in rome began
His nose his iyen patricyan gave in charge
To be cut of by furious cruelte
And of the empire that was so wide and large
Leoncyus next governed the cite
And through fortunes mutabilyte
The same leonce by tybery was cast down
His iyen put out dyed in prison
Tyberyus after served of the same
His nose cut of from his se put down
For a rebuke and a perpetual shame
To a cite that called was cerson
Without mercy favor or raunson
Exyled he was prisoned as a thief
By long torment dyed at mischeef
How Philyp the empeorour dyed at myscheef.
NExt to bochas came philip on the ringe
Whose empire no while did endure
Like an heretyke cursyd of living
And odious to every creature
Beat down images and many fressh pycture
Of holy saints which in their temples stood
Whereby romans dempt that he was wode
Pursued he was by a manly knight
Called Anastayse and put out of his place
And in cecyle of very force and might
He did his iyen out of his head arace
By judgment his visage to difface
Semblably as he by great outrages
Of cristys feith diffaced the Images
Dyed at mischeef dyrkyd with blyndnesse
Than Anastayse took possession
In whoos time books bear witness
And chronicles also make mention
Of the empire was made dyuysion
That first was one / partyd into tweyne
Whereof mine auctoure in manner does complain
How Anastace was compelled to leave the Empire to be a priest and live in
pouerte.
AS he reherceth in his opinion
And thereupon does a ground deuyse
Cause and rote of their diuysion
Took original of falls couetyse
And ceriously he tells here the guyse
Into the church when richesse broughtin pride
All perfeccion anon was set aside
The poce staff and potent of doctrine
When it was chaungyd and list not abide
In wylfull pouerte but began anon declyne
On stately pastures and hye horse to ride
Short heirs were also laid aside
Turned to copes of purpyl and sanguyne
Gowns of scarlet furryd with hermyn
Slendre fare of wine and watre clear
With abstynence of bread made of whete
Chaungyd tho days to many fat dynere
With confect drink and ypoctas sweet
All sobrenesse did his bounds let
S^a^snesse of fode left his old estate
With new excess began wex delycat
Goos^ly living in the church appalled
Caused greeks withdraw them in sentence
From the pope in petyrs place stallyd
And list to him do none obedyence
Falls avarice caused this offense
That the greeks did them silf dyuyde
Fro the romans for her great pride
Thus couetyse and falls ambucion
Did first great harm in the spiritual
Brought in discord and dyuysion
Among princes in their estate royal
Who clymbeth highest most perilous is his fall
Record I take of the forsayde Anastace
By theodosie put out of his place
This theodosie did his besy pain
On ^nastace such werre for to make
That maugre him he did him so constreyne
That he was feign the empire to forsake
For fere and dread he did upon him take
The order of priest from the Imperial see
Content with little lived in pouerte
How the head of Lupus king of lumbardye was smet of by Grymaldus.
aFter these chaunges reme^bryd by writi^ges
Like as I have told here in party
Came to bochas four mighty kings
Regnynge echon of old in lumbardye
After the manner and guyse in Barbarye
They were arrayed in their passage
With here forgrowen body and visage
Their berdys raught over their nauyll down
Their garnementys of colors manyfolde
With broad baudrykes enbraced enuyron
Large buckles and pendauntes of fine gold
Their brech enbroudryd after the guyse of old
Fret with peerle leg stuckyd to the kne
Pleynynge to bochas of their aduersite
Their shoon were raced fresshly to the toon
Richely transuersed with gold wyre
And thereon set many a strong stone
Geyn phoebus light shone full bright and clear
These lumbarde kings began to approach nere
The first of all the king lupus
Unto Bochas began to complain thus
Bochas quod he as for my party
For to reherce by short conclusion
One grymaldus a prince of lumbardye
Has me enclosyd out of my region
And cruelly encheyned me in prison
And after that did a sargeaunt send
Smet of mine head and there I made an end
How the head of Alexyus was smet of by comperton
AFter this end reherced of Lupus
For to declare his mortal heaviness
Next in order there came Alexius
A lumbarde king famous of richesse
Which took on him of surquedous prowess
For to compace the destruction
Of a prince called comperton
Which ware also a crown in lumbardye
Atwyx both was werre and great distaunce
But all the people and lordys of pauye
With mighty hand and marciall governance
The said alexius brought unto mischaunce
And Comperton escaped from all dread
Of mortal vengeance let smite of his head
How Aryperton was drowned with his richesse.
aFter whoos death pitously pleynynge
Tofore John bochas came ariperton
Of Lumbardye whilom lord and king
Which like a fool of high presumpcion
All causeles took occasion
Of volunte there is no more to say
Ageyn the duke of Bagaroys to werreye
These princys tweyne taken have the feelde
And of aryperton the party began apeyre
His aduersarye anon as he beheld
His cowarde heart began disespeyre
Into Pauye for fere he began repeire
Took his tresour in purpoos anon right
For very dread to take him to the flight
Took a vessel and entered is the se
With sodeyn tempest assailed and derkenesse
His barge perisshed by great aduersite
And was drowned with all his great richesse
Lo here the fine of wordly wretchydnesse
Namely of them to get great tresours
That gynne werre ageyn their neighbors
How dediere by pope adrian and Charles of france was put to flight and dyed
at mischeef.
NExt to Bochas with heavy look and chere
King of Lumbardye showed his presence
Called in his time noble Dediere
Notable in arms and of great excellence
And where his fader had done offense
To the pope and full great duresse
This king cast the damages to redress
Agistolphe was his fadres name
Which to the pope did great aduersite
For which his son to encres his fame
Of royal fredom and magnanymyte
And of benygne lyberalite
Gave to the pope with humble reverence
A statly cite that called is faience
Therewith he gave great tresoure and great good
As he that list of fredom for to spare
A mighty castle which on Tybre stood
Within the boundye and lordship of ferrare
Which is a cite pleynly to declare
Of antiquite mine auctour tells so
And stant upon the ryu^re of the poo
This Dediere regnynge in Lumbardye
Began wex famous at his beginning
Had great name upon each party
But in this earth is no thing abidinge
All stant on change and fortune in werkinge
Is found wastable and double of her visage
Which of this king chaungyd the courage
There he was large on every side
Lyberall found in many sundry wise
His goodlyhede was chaungyd in to pride
And his larges in to couetyse
Of doubleness he began anon dyuyse
To cleyme ageyn as ye shall understand
His said gifts out of the popes hand
Which dediere had made alyaunce
As the cronycle makes mencyon
With king pepyne regnynge tho in france
After whoos death to have possession
And full lordshyp of all that region
He began of new fall at distaunce
Both with the pope and with the king of france
Of presumpsion these werres he began
Ageyn his promys of double variaunce
Pope in tho days was holy adryan
Which to stynt the trouble and great myschaunce
Required help of the king of france
And great Charles in bochas as I read
Came to the pope to help in this need
Charles that time was cheef protectoure
To holy church their pauys and diffence
Which of hole heart and dyligent labor
With Dediere by manly violence
He met in Tuskye of knightly excellence
Had a battle to preue their both might
Charles victor dediere put to flight
As I find he fled into pauye
Worthy charles laid a syege aforne
Constreyned them upon each party
For lack of vitayle they were almost lorne
They wantyd lycoure greyn and corn
By sodeyn constreynt and great aduersite
To king Charles they yielded up the cite
King Dedyere was sent into France
With mighty cheynes fetred in prison
Like a wretch in sorrow and great penounce
Dyed at mischeef there gained no rounson
Which had before so great possession
After whoos day by old writing
Among lumbardes was never crowned king
Of pope John a woman with child and put down.
AFter the princis reherced here toforn
Drownyd in terys came a creature
Like a busshop rounded and shorn
And as a priest he had a broad tonsure
Her apparayle outward and vesture
Being a woman whereof bochas took head
Like a prelate shape was her wede
She was the same that of yore agon
Unworthily sat in petyrs place
Was afterward called pope Ihon
A berdles prelate none here seen on her face
Of her birth named was the place
Ma^ence a cite stondynge in Itayle
Upon the Reen full famous of vitayle
In her youth and in her tender age
Forsook her kynne and in especial
Cast she would for her advantage
Gave her to cu^nynge body heart and all
And in the sciences called lyberall
In all seuyn by famous excellence
By great study she had experyence
Her name couth in many diverse land
To show her cu^nynge first when she began
Searching prouynces came to Inglonde
No wight supposing but that she was a man
Came to rome her story tell can
Taught gramer sophistry and logyk
Rad in scoles openly rethoryk
In the time of emperor Lotarye
After the death as made is mencyon
Fro mine auctour if I shall not varye
That the pope which called was leon
The said woman by election
I stallyd was no wight supposinge than
By no tokne but that she was a man
The book of Fortys after that anon
Of adventure turnyd vpso down
She was named and called pope John
Of whose natural disposicion
Fill by process in to temptacion
Quyk with child the hour came on her than
Was delivered at saint John Lateran
After put down for her great outrage
I will on her spend no more labor
But pass over all the surplusage
Of her living and of her great error
Turn my style unto the emperor
Called arnolde and write his pytous chance
Son to charles the great king of france
To this Charlys as bokys determyne
He was son not borne in marriage
But begoten of a concubyne
Took upon him of surquedous outrage
Without title birth or lynage
To succeed by fraud and falls labor
Among romeyns to regne as emperor
He was ungracious sittinge in that estate
In mischeef spent his days euerychon
With lys and worms made unfortunate
Through skyn and flessh fret unto the bone
Craft of medecyne nor socoure was there none
So deep was fret in his entrayle
Dyed in distress no leche might avail
Bochas counseyleth pryncys to remember on Arnolde.
Mine auctour bochas stynte here for a while
Sharped his pen of entencion
Began to anger to transporte his style
To write of tyrauntys the transgression
More wode and fell than any scorpion
Them counceylinge when they be most bold
For to remember of this proud Arnolde
He ne was not in his pride assailed
Not with w^lues tygres nor lions
With rauynous berys nor wild bores trauayled
Nouther with other mighty chaumpions
Which have conquered many regions
But with worms engendryd of his kind
The said ^rnolde was murdryd as I find
In such disioynt the seyde arnold stood
With lys and wormys fret ageyn nature
That was so nigh borne of charles blood
Impotent the pain to endure
Which was in soth an uncouth adventure
That a prince might not be socoured
Of small worms for to be dououred
A great exaumple who list considre
To princys all for to abate their pride
Late them considre their fragylite
To se an emperor to abide
Thassaute of worms and lay their boost aside
In this arnolde wisely aduertyse
How god has power their pomp to chastyse
Death of arnolde did my pen encoumbre
For the great abhomynacion
Than to bochas came the twelve in noumbre
Called pope John as made is mention
Entering by fraud and falls eleccion
To goddys law froward and contrary
Not like a pastor but like a marcenarye
Called aforne he was octauian
Nothing resembling petyrs governance
Fro the time in rome that he began
To sit as pope he yaue his attendaunce
To follow his lust and his flesshly plesaunce
In hawkynge and huntinge stood his felicite
And among wymen conuersaunt for to be
Unto surfete Riot and glotonye
He gave him holy took of god no keep
Greatly disclaundryd he was of lecherye
Kept in his court without shame or dread
A noumbre of wymen in cronycle as I read
Two cardynalles of purpose did entende
His vicious life to correcke and amend
And of entente these cardynalles two
The church esclaundred cast them to redress
Made lettres sent them to o^cho
Duke of Saxon that he should him dress
Toward rome and of hye noblesse
On holy church to have compassion
Make of this mischeef just reformacion
This pope John when he has perceived
Of these cardynalles the manner of weytynge
And how the duke the lettres has received
He to do vengeance made no taryenge
Bode no lengre this Judgment yeuynge
Cut of the nose felly of that one
Hand of that other and each was called John
The emperor did his letters send
To this pope of hole affeccion
Of his defautys he should him amend
But there was found no correction
For which he was deposyd and put down
By cardynalles for his cursydnesse
Me list no more to write of his wretchidnesse
For his defautys and his great outrage
This John put down as ye have herd deuyse
Mine auctoure after caught a great courage
Seeing this myscheef in many sundry wise
In holy church which that did arise
Among prelates cast them silf blyue
Their diffautes openly to descryue
Of their pride and presumpcion
And while he began study in this matere
He began remember anon in his reason
Upon a vere wreten in the sautere
Touch not my prophetys ne nigh them not to nere
Nor ageyn them beware in deed and thought
In no wise that ye malygne naught
For this cause as ye shall understand
Touching this matere pleynly as I read
Mine auctoure began withdraw his hand
Left his purpose and forth began proceed
To whoos presence or that he took head
Came a prince Duke Charles of Loreyn
Him besought to write his grievous pain
Of Charles of Loreyn confou^dyd with hungre.
THis duke of loreyne as ye shall conceive
Had werre with the king of france
Called Hugh Capet and I apperceyue
An archbusshop to do the king plesaunce
Of hatrede made his ordinance
Ageyn this duke awayte upon him set
That he him took abed when he slept
The said busshop began falsely vndremyne
This worthy duke by full falls treson
Which as I find was called ancelyne
And he was busshop that time of leon
Which by fraud and falls collusion
Took this prince that was duke of loreyne
And to the king he brought him by a treyne
By whom he was delivered to prison
To Orliaunce and with cheynes bound
What was his end was made no mention
But in a pytte horrible and profounde
Myscheef with hunger did him so confound
That I suppose this Duke of Loreyne
Consumed was for constreynt of his pain
How king Salamon whilom King of Hungery was put to flight
aFter to bochas there came down
Princys four and each for his party
Their greues told and first Salamon
That whilom regnyd in hungerye
Both fool and cowarde books specefye
Void of reason noysed of ignorance
And at a point could no purueaunce
Fortune also did at him dysdeyne
For he was nouther manly nor corageous
Ageyn whom were worthy knights tweyne
He^^a was one with Laudisalus
Famous in arms notable and virtuous
Both at onys on salamon came down
And made him fle out of his region
Through his unhappy froward cowardice
There was in him found no defense
Flight was his shield list in no wise
Geyn his enmyes make resistance
Failed heart to come to presence
To save his land he dred him silf so sore
Of whom bochas write in his book no more
How Petro king of hu^gery was slain
ANother king put here in remembrance
Called petro regnynge in hungerye
For his defautys ageyn the king of France
I called Charles of malice and folly
By indignacion that was his tormentrye
His iyen put out there was no better socoure
And after slain by dome of the Emperor
How Dyogenes the Emperor was taken / and his iyen put out.
aFter to bochas there ca^ tweyn on the ringe
Duke of Swene formest as I read
Ageyn the emperor first maliciously werki^ge
Henry the Emperor regnynge tho in deed
But for his malice this was his fatal mede
Banysshed to dwell among bestys savage
Slain in a forest for his great outrage
When Constantyne departed from this life
Which of all greece was lord and gouernoure
By marriage of her that was his wife
A knight Dyogenes was made emperor
Fortune to him did so great favor
Constantinople holding in his hand
As souereyne prince of all grekys land
Yet there was su^me that grutchid therageyn
And had of him great indignacion
The king of perce Belset Tarque nyayne
Fro him by force took many a region
Mesopotanye to his possession
Took by strong hand through his chyualrye
Maugre diogenes and almoost all surrye
Belset tarquenyan made him silf so strong
By manly force Dyogenes to assail
And for Dyogenes thought he did him wrong
He began ordeyne great stuf and apareyle
A day assigned they met in battle
Dyogenes of froward adventure
He and his knights brought to disconfiture
Take he was and brought by great disdeyne
In whom as tho there was no resistance
To king belset called tar uynyan
And when he came to his prsence
Ageyns him was you this sentence
To lie down plat and that king belset
Should take his foot and on his throat set
This was done for an hye despyte
Dyogenes brought forth on a cheyne
Without reverence favor or respite
At great festys assigned was his pain
And aldrelaste put out his iyen tweyne
The whele of fortune tourneth as a ball
Sodeyn clymbynge axeth a sodeyn fall
How Robert Duke of Normandye faught with the Turks / was named to the crown
of Jerusalem / and dyed at myscheef.
A worthy prince spoken of in many realm
Noble Robert duke of Normandy
Chose to the crown of Ierusaleem
But for cause he did it deny
Fortune unto him had envy
The same Robert next in order was
Than came to pleyne his fatal unto bochas
For cristys feyth this mighty champion
This duke Robert armed in plate and mayle
With manly Godfray Godfray Bollion
Ageyn turks faught a great battle
For cristys feyth that it should avail
To sustene the law in their intent
To all the kings of the occident
Of turks and sarasyns was so great a noumbre
Geyn cristys law gadred in puissaunce
The feith of crist falsely to encombre
But there were made hasty ordinance
By kings of England normandye and france
First to socoure did his besy pain
Godfrey Bollyon that was duke of Loreyn
Which on sarasyns made a disconfyture
Maugre turks for all their great might
In which battle crist made him recure
The feelde that day to supporte his right
Where the seide robert was found so good a knighte
That for his nobles by record of writynge
Of Jerusalem was named tobe king
Assentyd not to the eleccion
By cause of new that he did vndrestonde
His eldre brother for short conclusion
I called wyllyam was ded in Inglonde
Would in no wise take the crown on hand
Of Jerusalem but like a manly knight
Came to England for to claim his right
And yet or he came he had knowlegynge
His younger brother called herry
Had upon him take to be crowned king
Told his lords and princys finally
He was next heir entryd rightfully
As enheritoure to succeed in that realm
His brother being king of Ierusaleem
God wot the cause stood all in other wise
The said Robert duke of Normandye
Purposyd him by marcyall empryse
From his brother to take the regalye
Took his princys and his chiualrye
Thought he would like a manly knight
Arryue in Inglonde and rejoice his right
Both in one field assemblyd on a day
The brethren tweyne each with strong party
To darreyne and make no delay
Each with other to hold champartye
But when these lords the mischeef did espy
They besyed them and were not recheles
Atwene the brethern to refourme pees
The seyde brethern were fully condescendyd
Upon this point for short conclusion
As in the acorde was justly comprehendyd
Henry to hold and have possession
During his life of all this region
And Roberte should have for his party
A so^me of gold with all Normandy
Three thousand pound put in remembrance
Each year to Robert sent fro this region
Of which payment to make full assurance
Was laid hostages as made is mencyon
But yet of new fill a dissencion
Atwene the brethren of hatrede and envy
For a certain castle that stood in normandye
Which castle longed of heritage
Unto the kings Jurisdiction
Of which the duke took his advantage
Maugre the king and held possession
Turned after to his confusion
And when the king this thing did espy
With strong hand came to normandye
Where the duke was laid a sege about
Made ordenaunce to recure his right
Gate the Castle took his brother out
Emprisoned him of very force and might
Left him alone out of mennys sight
Fourtene year the cronycle writes so
There he dyed in myscheef and in woo
While Bochas was besy in his labor
His book tacomplyssh with great diligence
To him apperyd the great emperor
Called henrye showed his presence
Began complain upon the great offense
Done to him the myscheef and distress
By his sons great unkindness
The which son was called eke henry
Greatly accused of ingratitude
Cause he wrought so disnaturally
Took his fadre with force and multitude
Entretyd him boysteously and rude
And afterward there geyned no raunson
At great myscheef dyed in prison
How Iocelyne prince of Rage for pride slouthe and lecherye dyed in pouerte.
NExt in order with trist and deed visage
Unto Bochas to show his heaviness
Came Iocelyne lord and prince of rage
Which is a cite famous of richesse
And this prince mine auctoure bears witness
Wos greatly you to sloth and slogardye
And all his lust he set in lecherye
Left his lordshyp out of governance
For lak of wysdom and discrecion
In flesshly lust set all his plesaunce
And to the cuntrees about him enuyron
He was not had in reputation
Certain princys mine auctoure does descryue
Of his lordship cast him to depryue
Among which the prince of alapye
Called sanguyne the story who list se
To Iocilyne having great envy
Laid a siege to Rages the cite
He being absent far from that cuntre
And thus for sloth and wylfull neclygence
Rages was take by mighty violence
And Iocelyne commanded to prison
To him fortune was so contrarious
Lost his lordshyp and domynacion
Loo here the fine of folks vicious
Slow delicat proud and lecherous
Dyed in pouerte in myscheef and in need
Of vicious princys lo here the fynall mede
How the emperor Androuycus slough all that were of the blood royal
cherisshed vicious people and after was hanged.
AS very heir here and true successoure
By election and also by lynage
Came andronycus lord and emperor
Of constantynople crowned king of age
Next to bochas with trift and pale visage
Besechinge him to do his besy cure
To remember his woeful aventure
Among grekys by storye and scripture
This andronicus gouernyd not aright
Again law and eke again nature
Found with his sustre flesshly on a night
Both of assent took them to the flight
Ageyn him his cosyn was so fell
Lord of that cuntre called Emanuell
For a time stood as a man exiled
For his dissencions and many an uncouth stryf
By his princes after reconcyled
Stondynge in hope he should amend his lif
But in the time that he was fugityf
He was made lord and stood so for a while
Regnynge in pontus of Asie a great I Will
In this while Emanuell was deed
Fall in great age the storye tells thus
Having a child and he who list take heed
While he dwelled in his faders house
Among Greeks called Alexius
And the tutour he was assygned to
I called Alixius was also
The same that was assygned his tutoure
To se upon him all the governance
And full power as lord and emperor
Had all the empire under the obeysaunce
Princys lords gave to him attendaunce
Where that he were present or absent
Each thing was done at his commandment
I mean as thus he had all in hand
Constantynople a cite of great substance
But for extorcyons which he did in the land
On his subgettes and for misgouernaunce
Among the lords it fill in remembrance
All of assent in heart began desire
Call Andronycus ageyn to his empire
By assent restored and crownyd emperor
Constantynople entering the cite
Bysyed him by fraudolent labor
All the blood born of the Imperial se
For to be slain by vengeable cruelte
By Judgment of this Andronycus
Exepte a prince called Isacyus
Thus in effect the troth was well seyn
He was vengeable last in his oldeage
Right as he was in his yerys grene
Felly governed full of falls outrage
Last of all malicious of courage
Took to counceile in Greece he was thus named
All such as were disclaundryd or diffamed
Homecydes he had in his household
Tyrauntes that wrought ageyn rightwysnesse
Cherisshed all that hardy were and bold
Wydowes wives maidens to oppress
Ribaudye was called gentylnesse
Spared nouther he was so lecherous
Wymen sworn chaste nor folk religious
Had also no manner conscience
To his subgettes falsely by rauyne
Took what him list by unjust violence
To all vices his youth he did enclyne
And all that were of the royal line
Were slain echon except Isacyus
As I told erst by andronycus
And as I find for him in have he sent
For this purpos to come to his presence
To murdre him this was his entente
By diverse toknes and many euydence
And fully knew the fine of his sentence
He like a prince list come nonere
Smet of the head of the messangere
And after that of manly prouydence
Myd the cite showed him like a knight
Prayde lords to give him audyence
Princys iuges for to do him right
That he might declare in that sight
Great Iniuryes damages outragyous
Wrought by the emperor called Andronycus
O citezyns that know all the guyse
Of your Emperor called andronycus
Not Emperor so as ye list advertise
But a tyrant cruel and furrous
A falls mordrere vengeable dispytous
Has of new and froward falls courage
Slain of the empire holy the lynage
There is a live left none of the blood
Save I alone of the royal line
For andronycus like a tyrant wode
Has slain echon brefly to termyne
His sword of vengeance they might not declyne
Now purposes of mortal tyranny
Sle me also that am of their alye
Requirynge you in this consistorye
O Cytezyns that here present be
To remember and call to memory
How this famous Imperial cite
Has ay ben ready to do equite
Besy also of their noblesse
Wrong of tyrauntes manly to oppress
Philosophers and poetys eke deuyse
In their sawes prudent and notable
Blood of tyrauntes is noble sacrifyse
To god above when they be vengeable
And since ye be rightful just and stable
In your werkys void of varyaunce
Weye this matere justly on balaunce
The people echon all of one assent
For outrages of this andronycus
Put him down by rightful Judgment
In whoos place set up Isacius
The said tyraunte froward and vicious
Began malign and them silf dress
In his diffence to make a forteresse
It help him not to make resistance
So as he stood void of all favor
Syeged he was and by violence
Maugre his might rent out of that toure
Spoiled cruelly felt no better socoure
Sode all naked quakynge in his pain
And first rent out one of his iyen tweyne
And ouermore he had this reward
Without help socoure or respyte
Rode on an ass his face set bakwarde
The assys tail holding for despyte
Whom to behold the people has delight
To pore and rich through the cite
Him to rebuke was grauntyd lyberte
After all this in a carte set
And vengeably lad out of town
By dome hanged on an hye gybet
The people on him to his confusion
Made clamoure and terryble soun
Would never fro the galowes wend
Till in mischeef by death made an end
Lenuoye.
IN this tragedye ageyn Audronytus
Bochas makes an exclamacion
Ageyn all princys vicious
While they have power and domynacion
By tyranny use extorcion
Concludynge thus that their falls living
Of right requires to have an evil ending
Indifferently this tyrant Lecherous
Of wives maydyns made none excepcion
Following his lust froward and disclaundrous
Spared no woman of religion
Made wives break their profession
By violence peyse well all this thing
Of right requires to have an evil ending
Most in murdre he was contagious
Of Innocent blood to make effusion
Vengeable also ageyn all virtuous
Ageyns his kinrede sought occasion
To sle them fro which that he came down
Which consydryd all such falls werkynge
Of right requires to have an evil ending
Bochas manaceth princys outrageous
Which by their proud hateful abusion
To god and man of will contrarious
Having in heart a falls opinion
All tho that been in their subjection
They may devour their power so searching
Which shall not fail to have an evil ending
Noble princes ye that been desirous
To persevere in your domynacion
And in all virtue to be victorious
Cherissh troth put falshede down
Be mercyable mesured by reason
Of Andronytus the surfetys showing
That ye by grace may have a good ending
Of Isacyus made blind and taken at myscheef
AS is reherced when Isacyus
Had all the empire in his possession
To avenge the death of andronytus
Constantinople in that royal town
A brother of his there came down
With a bacyn brennynge bright as glede
Made him blind of him no more I read
Except Isacyus was take at mischeef
Of him that wrought to his destruction
Lyenge awayte as does a preuy thief
Took the emperor put him in prison
Vengeably did execucion
As is remembryd with a bacyn bright
Brennynge read hot and so he lost his sight
A son he had called alexius
Tender of age cast him to succeed
By his tutour falls and contrarious
Murdered he was at myscheef as I read
The same tutor purposynge as in deed
Of the empire by falls collusion
By fraud and mede to have possession
In this chaptre of him no more I find
Reherced here in order by writynge
But to mine auctour the process makes mind
There came in have Sangot of Egypt king
And with him came pitously wepinge
Mighty princis soudanys tweyne
Regnynge in damas their falls to complain
Of Alopye Salech was that one
Kegnynge in Damas of his true right
Cathabadyn there being eke soudan
Which in tho days was hold a mighty knight
And right notable in every mannys sight
And for the Soudan of Babylon a far
Called saladyn oppressyd was with werre
For socoure sent these princys tweyne
To come in have with all their chiualrye
Him to support and do their besy pain
Enforce their might to sustene their party
Whoos request they lift not deny
Abode no lengre but made them silf strong
To stand with him were it right or wrong
Of this matter the substance to conclude
These princys came Salech and Cathabadyn
For their guyrdon they found ingratitude
In this for the said Soudan saladyn
Found him unkind pleynly this the fine
From their estate as it was after know
Disgraded them brought them down full low
Of him in sothe they had none other mede
For their labor nor for their kindness
What fill after in Bochas I not read
For he furthwith leueth this process
And unto robert does his style dress
Called Farentyne regnynge in Tarence
Lost his lordship by sodeyne violence
This to say he reigned but awhile
This said robert lost his governance
Next to Bochas came Quyllyam of cecile
King of that cuntre lord of great puissaunce
Lost his kingdom through fortunes variaunce
His iyen tweyne rent out of his head
After dyed in myscheef and dread
Which Quyllyam regnynge in cecile
Was by discente borne nigh of allye
To robart quisterde as books do compyle
That whilom was duke of Normandye
Greatly delytinge in chyualrye
With his brother full notable of renoun
Brought naples to subjection
His brothers name called was Rogere
Which had a son called enheritoure
Called Tancret as seith the cronyculere
Which took upon him to regne as successor
Thus in Cecile Tancret was gouernoure
Ageyn whom by title sought a far
Of alyaunce he began a mortal werre
For a maid that called was constaunce
That daughter was to the king Rogere
Which was set of spiritual plesaunce
To be religious of hole heart and entere
And by record of the cronyculere
This Constaunce has the world forsake
And to religion has her body take
Of this constaunce the silf same year
That she was borne as made is mention
There was a clerk a great astronomere
Told of her birth by calculacion
She should cause the desolacion
Of that kingdom by process of her age
By the occasion only of marriage
Su^me that were to tancret great enmy
By their ungoodly exortacion
Moved the emperor that called was herry
To take constaunce from her religion
And by the popys dispensacion
She weddyd was the emperor by his might
By ty^le of her put tancret from his right
With a great nounbre of Italyens
The Emperor entryd into that regyon
But by favor of ceciliens
Tancret long time stood in possessyon
But through fortunes transmutacion
The same time to conclude in sentence
The said Tancret dyed on pestylence
His son Quylliam that was but young in deed
With Ceciliens cast him not to fail
To keep his land and his right possede
Mete the emperor with statly apparayle
Made him ready with him to have a battle
But the emperor to great advantage
Cast otherwise of fraud in his courage
Feynyngly during the discord
The Emperor cast another wyle
By a falls color to fall at acorde
And young Quyllyam ungoodly to begyle
Under tretye takyn in cecile
Falsely depryued of his region
Sent to Itayle and throw in prison
By weye of trety the story who list se
All concluded under falls treson
With Quylliam take were his susters three
His iyen put out for more conclusion
He perpetually dampnyd to prison
Dyed in pouerte lost his enherytaunce
Loo here the fine of worldly variaunce
Ferther to write as John bochas began
After that Quyllyam was put from his realm^
To him apperyd Quyot lucynyan
Chose before king of Ierusaleem
Whoos knightly fame shoon like the son beme
Which by his noblesse he whilom did atteyne
Godfrey present that was duke of Loreyne
But by the Soudon named Saladyne
He was enchaced of that dignyte
All worldly pomp draws to declyne
So for the constreynt of his aduersyte
The yerys passyd of his prosperyte
Went into Cypre as a fugitif
What fill after I read not in his life
To make his compleynt after him came one
Which had stand in great perplexite
E^le of bryenne and was called John
Which afterward was king of the cite
Called Jerusalem and also parde
A fair doughtre young and tender of age
Joined after to fredryk in marriage
Being that time lord and emperor
Was desirous above all other thing
Of Jerusalem to be gouernoure
And of cecyle to be crowned king
Which altherlast for his subtle werkynge
Constreyned was down fro that party
To be a capteyn for sonde in lumbardye
Of herry the eldest son of Fredryk the second mischeuyd by his fadre.
nExt to bochas crokyd halt and seek
One called herry came for to pleyne
The eldest son unto fredryk
Which by sickness had felt great pain
M^gre and pale contract in every vein
Of whoos langoure the cheef accasion
Was that he lay so long time in prison
All his disese at great aduersyte
I caused was for short conclusion
By his faders froward cruelte
As bochas after makes mention
And this herry by generation
Son unto fredryk like as it is found
I mean fredryk called the second
This herry by dissent of line
Of Cecile first was crowned king
And of Jerusalem whose renoun did shine
Through many a land at his beginning
And fortune also in her werkinge
Was to this herry passyngly notable
In all his works July favorable
Of his person he had this advantage
To all the people he was right acceptable
Well co^mendyd in his flouringe age
Of chere and face and look right ameable
And of his port very demure and stable
Called in his gynnynge such favor he has wo^ne
Of princys all very light and son
But often it falls that a glad morning
When phoebus shows her bemys fair and bright
The day su^tyme thereupon following
With some derke sky is clipsyd of his light
And semblably through fortunes might
This said prince by her falls variaunce
Fond in her whele full noyous fell greuaunce
Who may the furyes of fortune appese
Her troubly wawes to make them calm and pleyn
Where men most trust they find most disease
Where double corages stand in no certain
A shynynge day is often meynt with reyne
Thus of fredryk the great unstableness
Has brought his son in mischeef and distress
This Frederyk set up in a great favor
By the popys diligent business
Unto the state lift up of emperor
But through his fatal froward unkindness
Of couetise fill in such excess
Took upon him patrimony to guye
Of cristys church that part to occupye
Fill in the popes indignacion
Counseyle nor trety might none avail
But of malice and presumpcion
Cast with the pope to have a great battle
The said herry his fadre began counsel
Ageyn the church to do no violence
But him submytte with humble obedience
This stryf endurynge atwene these great estates
Fredryk made his son to be accused
To him of crymelese magestatys
Would not suffer he should be accused
But like a man maliciously refused
By his fadres cursed falls treson
He was co^maundyd to dye in prison
Su^me books sey he was takyn and brought
To his fader of dome to have sentence
But like a man passed sorrow and thought
Which to his life had none aduertence
Furiously and with great violence
As he was lad alas on horsbak
His horse fill down and so his neck he brake
Some books reherce of him and seyn
His fader took ageyn him occasion
And when he had long in cheynes leyne
At great mischeef he dyed in prison
And some say that he fill down
Of a bridge bochas rherceth here
And drowned was in a deep Ryuere
A comendacion of bochas of such as be kind to their kynrede.
nExt in order mine auctour did his cure
To make a special co^mendacion
Of such as be disposyd by nature
And by their kyndly inclynacion
As blood requires and generation
To aquyte them silf in thought will and deed
Without feynynge unto their kynrede
Specially that none unkindness
Be found in them for none aduersite
To considre of natural gentilnesse
To them appropryd is mercy and pity
And to avoid the false duplicite
That was in Frederyk which so unkindly
Let sle his son that called was herry
Pity is appropryd to kynrede
Fadre and modre by disposycion
To cherissh their children and eke feed
Till seuene yerepasse law makes mention
And as they be bound of natural reason
That time passed their tendrenes to enclyne
Unto fortune by virtuous disciplyne
Than afterward in their adolescence
Virtuously to teache them and chastyse
Norissh them in doctrine and science
Fostre in virtue vicys to despise
To be curteys prudent sad and wise
For when they gynne with virtue in that age
Gladly after they do great outrage
As it longs to every gentle line
And blood royal by kindly Influence
To fader and mother show them silf benygne
Of humble hertes do the in reverence
Ay to remember in their aduertence
On syx princys that wrought the contrary
For which fortune was their aduersarye
Euerich to other found was unkind
In cursyd blood may be no kyndnesse
Of one tarage sauoureth tree and rynde
The fruit also bears of the tree witness
And semblably the fadres cursydnesse
With mortal sword in nature reprouable
Again the child is often seen vengeable
Among which Brutus is rekned one
Next in order follows maulius
Slough their children by record euerichon
Philip maulyus and also Cassyus
And cruel herod fell and malycious
Fredryk also most vengeably
Slough his son that called was herry
This fredryk ay benign and contrary
Toward his son not gracious nor benygne
From holy church ungoodly he began vary
And therageyn frowardly malign
And like a man obstynat and vndigne
Dyed a cursyd through misgouernaunce
Without confession or repentance
How Manfroye king of poyle was slain.
Next to bochas of poyle came the king
Began his fall and compleynt specefye
Called manfroy and for his false werkinge
Put down and slain cause of his tyranny
Loo what avails scepter or rigalye
To a tyraunte which of violence
List to godwarde have none aduertence
How Encys king of Sardany died in prison.
With look down cast dedly pale of there
Of Sardanya Eneys next came down
King of that land to tell the manner
How he we^^ayed ageyn the mighty town
Called Bonya to his confusion
By them venquesshed and with cheynes round
Dyed in prison so long he lay there bound
Following mine auctoure called bochas John
In Sardanya as he makes mind
Serpent nor wulf in that land was none
Having a well which of very kind
Theuys iyen the water makes blind
To true folk as he does dyuyne
Water thereof was health and medecyne
There grows also an herb as books say
Which that is so diverse of nature
Who tastes thereof laughing he shall dye
No medecyne may help them nor socoure
The touch thereof stante eke in adventure
If it enter his mouth on any side
He shall alive for laughter not abide
Another Frederyk was slain by judgment of his brother.
There was another froward frederyk
Son of alphonce that was king of castyle
Of courage wode and eke frentyke
His own brother falsely to begyle
Began a werre lasting but awhile
Whoos purpos was his brother to desceyue
And the crown of Castyle to receive
This frederyk came with a great battle
Ageyn his brother for the same entente
Of his purpose yet he did fail
God nor fortune were not of assent
Take in the fe^ld and by Judgment
Of his brother for his great trespace
Slain openly had no better grace
How manymettus and Argones dyed at myscheef
Manymettus of perce lord and king
Came next in prees destressyd in great pain
Upon fortune pitously playnynge
His aduersite did him so constreyne
For there was one which at him did dysdeyn
Called argones void of title or ligne
Geyn manymettus proudly began malign
Which Ergones for his presumpcion
Take at myscheef by sodeyn violence
His dome was gyuene to dye in prison
Of no power to make resistance
But fortune that can no difference
On his chaungys atwene friend and foo
Caused them dye at mischeef both two
How Charles king of Jerusalem / and of Cecile for auaryce and auoutrye died
at myscheef.
aFter these forsayde reherced in sentence
As bochas rehercith in his style
Came noble Charles unto presence
King of Jerusalem and also of Cecile
Of whoos coming mine auctour a great while
Astonyed was to se his knightly face
With such chere come into place
For by his port who beheld him well
Consydryd first his look and his visage
It sempte he trade upon fortunes whele
And of his noble marcyall courage
Had of her power gotten advantage
Showing him silf on each party
Her and her might did utterly dyffye
First to comende his royal hye lynage
And of his virtuous famous aliyaunce
And by writynge and praysynge of langage
The name of him specially to auaunce
Seyth he was born of the blood of france
And to encres most souereynly his prys
Writes he was brother unto seint lowys
Gave to france this comendacion
So as phoebus passes each other sterre
Right so that kingdom in comparison
Passes every land both nigh and far
In polycye be it pees or werre
For it transcendeth in pees by prouydence
And in werre by knightly excellence
These words be not take of mine auctoure
Entitled here for a remembrance
By one Laurence which was translatour
Of this process to commend france
To preyse that land was all his plesaunce
Seith Influence of that royal land
Made charles so worthy of his hand
Of whoos noblesse pope urban had Joy
Him to encres for virtuous living
Which that time was duke of Angeoy
After chosen of cecile to be king
Of pope urban required by writing
Toward rome that he should him dress
Of king manfroy the tyranny to oppress
Ageyn the pope and holy church right
This said manfroye did great extorcion
Noble Charles as goddys own knight
Came with strong hand up to rome town
Which in his cu^mynge gave possession
To Gyot manfort for to have the guard
In his passage and govern the vauwarde
To rome with great ordenaunce
They passed over the bounds of Itayle
This manly knight this charles born in france
Lad with him many strong battle
The popes enmy manly to assail
But all this while to stand at diffence
This said Charles found no resistance
Entringe rome to be their protectoure
Full well received at his first entering
Chose and preferred for cheef senatoure
By the pope most glad of his cu^mynge
Of Cecyle was after crowned king
And of Jerusalem as made is mention
Granted to him full possession
Which in his gynnynge bare him so well
Entringe that land with knightly apparaile
Of Cassyne gate first the strong castele
At Boneament had a great battle
With king manfroye whoos party did assail
To reherce shortly his adventure
Charles made on him a disconfiture
In which battle king manfroye was slain
And noble charles took possession
Whereof romans were full glad and feign
Yet in Cecile there was rebellyon
But they were brought unto subjection
Yet Corandyne record of all writynge
Son of Conrade claymed to be king
Began make him strong proudly took his place
At alygate a famous old cite
Noble charles with knightly chere and face
Fill upon him made him for to flee
And to set rest in the cuntre
To avoid trouble and make all thing certain
Gave Judgment Corandyne to be slain
Among kings notable and glorious
Charles was put as made is mencyon
Like a prince strong and victorious
In full pesyble and hole possession
Of Cecile and all that regyon
Ageyns whom was no disobeysaunce
Yeldyd of hole heart to his governance
By title also of his alyaunce
Fortune greatly did him magnefye
For as it is put in remembrance
The noble princes that called was marie
Doughtre to Stephene regnynge in hungerie
Joined was and knyt in marriage
To charles son to encres of his lynage
This same charles by auctorite
So as him list to ordeyne
Was made king of the great cite
Called Jerusalem of towns most souereyne
By which title he bare crowns tweyne
His brothre lowys old books say
The same time in Egypt began werreye
Gate all the cuntres about enuyron
Which that sarasyns did falsely occupye
Brought them ageyn to subjection
Of Jerusalem that land to magnefye
Cartage in Affryk with all their Rygalye
And all the cuntrees being aforne contraire
To king charles becam tributayre
This while he sat highest in his glory
Like phoebus shynynge in his myddaye spear
With many conqueste and many great victory
When his nobles shone most bright and clear
The same time with a frowning chere
Fortune began from Charles turn her face
And him beraft her favor and her grace
This lady fortune does seeld in one ^ontune
She is so gerissh of condition
A sorceresse a traytoure in common
Cast a falls mean to his destruction
One of his sons slain with poison
Which did eclipse mine auctour does express
A full great party of his old gladness
He was desclaundred of all the vice
Which aperteyneth unto tyranny
I mean the vice of froward auaryce
Which is contrary greatly unto his chiualrye
Diffamed also of falls auoutrye
Which was sustained through his mayntenaunce
Within the land by a knight of france
The same knight abidinge in his house
All cec^le troubled with that deed
The great offense was so disclaunderous
Through all the region it began to sprede
For thilke woman plainly as I read
Was wife to one which suffered this offense
And to be vengyd did his diligence
John Prosith pleynly was his name
Which cast him fully auengyd for to be
That king Charles should bear the blame
Sleen all the french men that bode in that cuntre
Without grace mercy and pity
And for to do full execucion
Required was the king of Arogon
Lost of Cecile hole the region
With obeysaunce of many cuntre
And of Jerusalem the possession
Fill by process in great aduersite
And last constrained with grievous pouerte
To god most mekely with full heavy chere
Sone to be deed was his prayere
Supprised he was with sorrow in his ^orage
Lost his force fill in to maladye
Langwysshed forth till he began fall in age
Ageyn fortune found no remedy
And by occasion of falls auoutrye
Fill to mischeef and for sorrow and dread
This charles dyed no more of him I read
Lenuoye.
like as phoebus in some fressh morning
After aurora the day does clarefye
Falls often that his bright shynynge
Is derkyd with some cloudy sky
A liknesse showed in this tragedye
Expert in charles the story dth o well preue
Youth and age rekned truly
The fair day men do praise at eve
The noble fame of his fressh gynnynge
To saint lowes he was nigh of allye
Right wise^ right manly / right virtuous of lyuinge
Called of knighthode flower of chyualrye
Till mayntenaunce of auoutrye
Came into his court to hurt his name and grieve
His life his death put in iupartye
The fair day men do praise at eve
Like desertys men have their guerdonynge
Virtuous life does princes magnefye
The contrary to them is great hindrynge
Folk expert the troth may not deny
Search out the reward of cursyd lecherye
Where it is used the household may not preue
In this matere to charles have an iye
The fair duy to praise toward eve
Noble princes all vices eschuynge
Your high courage late reason guye
Withdraw your hand fro ryotous watchinge
Fle flesshly lustys and vicious company
Oppress no man do no tyranny

Of your last age when it draws to eve
Of Hugolyne Earl of Pyse / slain in prison.
AFter charles storye rad the woeful fine
As ye have herd the manner and the gyse
To John Bochas apperyd Hugolyne
Called whilom the Earl of pyse
Till they began ageyn him arise
Most vengeable cruel and unkind
Slough him in pr^son no more of him I find
Save his children of hatrede and envy
Were murdered eke in a deep prison
Next with his compleynt the king of armonye
Came tofore Bochas that called was athon
A christian prince full famous of renoun
For our feith from which he list not err
Geyn tertarius long time he held great werre
This manly king in knighthode full famous
It was showed his story who list se
Had a brother fell and despytous
Called Sabath desirous to succeed
Stead of his brother the kingdom to possede
By falls treson reuyd of his right
Kept him in hold and put out of his sight
This sabath lost both hap and grace
His other brother as made is mention
By strong hand put him from his place
Chaced him out of that region
Take by force and fetryd in prison
Dyed there noman list him visit
Lo how god can treson and murdre quyte
How p^pe Boneface the viii was take by the lynage de Columpnys / ete his
hondys and did in prison
Among these woeful princys three
Which showed them so vggly of their chere
Pope boneface by great aduersite
The viii of that name began to approach nere
A thousand iii C accounted was the year
Fro cristys birth by computacion
When that he made his lamentacion
This same pope caught occasion
Which under petre kept governance
To Interdirte all the region
Time of king philip regnynge tho in france
Dirrct bulls down into constaunce
To Nycolas made by boneface
Archid^acon of the same place
Of holy church the prelates nygh echon
Busshoppys of france felly have declared
Preuynge by points many mo than one
In a great sin pleynly and not spared
By him the church was hurt and not repared
Put on him crimes of great mysgouernaunce
Denouncynge enmye to all the land of france
Put on him many great outrage
Wrongly how he had done offense
To a Cardynall born of the lynage
De Columpny^ a kynrede of reverence
For which cause he kept him absence
Out of the court drough where he was born
By which occasion the pope his life has lorn
De Columpnys the lynage has so wrought
Took Bonyface for his old cruelte
With great force and power they have him brought
Unto a castle which stood in the cite
Called sancti angeli gave auctorite
To a Cardynall and by commyssion
Power to do full execucion
Of these matters hanging in balaunce
Atwene parties were it right or wrong
Both of romans and prelates eke of france
The pope ay kept within the castle strong
Of adventure abiding there not long
Fill in a flixe and afterward for need
For hunger ete his handys as I read
Hour of his dyenge it is made mention
About the castle was merueylous lightnynge
Where the (...) lay fettred in prison
None such aforn was ^eyn in their living
And while Bochas was besy in writing
To write the fall of this bonyface
The order of templers came tofore his face
How the order of Templers was foundyd / and with other of the order brent.
CRonyculers the troth can record
Calling to mind the first fundacion
Of old auctours therewith accord
Of these Templers how the religion
Began that time when Godfray Bullion
Had won that noble knightly man
Jerusalem that order first began
By certain knights which did their besy peyn
When the cite was first I won
By noble Godfray duke whilom of loreyn
There crownyd king this order they begone
Old books well reherce konne
Taking a ground of pouerte and meekness
To found this order did their business
Their beginning began of devotion
She ground Itake of wylfull pouerte
And made first their habytacion
By the temple not far from the cite
In tokne of cle^nesse sworn to chastyte
Of the temple like to their desires
Took that name and called were Templeres
(...) Honorye gave them auctoryte
Of holy church being that time head
A white habyte they bare that time for chastyte
Eugenyus after gave them a cross of r^de
And to defend pilgrims out of dread
Geyne sarazyns through their high renoun
This was cheef point of their profession
While they lived in wylfull pouerte
These crossed knights in mantell clad of white
They are spread in many far cuntre
For in perfeccion was set all their delight
F^lke of devotion caught an appetyte
Them for to encres gave great alms
By which they began encres in great richesse
By process within few yerys
The noumbre great of their religion
And the fame of the said Templers
^an sprede wide in many region
With their sodeyn rysinge of their profession
With toures castellys they gave them to delices
Appalled in virtue which brought in many vices
It were to long to rekne them all
But among other I find there was one
A manly knight folk Jacques did him call
Great of auctorite among them euerichon
As chronicles remember of yore agon
The which Jacques in the realm of france
Was borne of blood to great enheritaunce
The same Jacques hold a manly knight
In his gynnynge fressh lusty of courage
Had a brother by elder title of right
Occupied all hole the heritage
Because Jacques younger was of age
Which might not by no condition
No thing cleyme of that possession
His elder brother occupied all
While this Jacques but low was of degree
Wondre desirous to be with him egall
Always put back by froward pouerte
And to surmounte if it would be
Fond out a mean like to his desires
Was chosyn master of the templers
Was promotyd by fre election
By them that should chese him of right
Whereby he had great domynacion
Richesse / tresoure / great power and might
Of his person was eke a manly knight
The same time put in remembrance
Philyp la Bele crowned king of france
Which had of Jacques great indignacion
To all the templers and all the chyualrye
Cast ways to their destruction
Gave auctorite his lust to fortefye
Down fro the (...) books specefye
Clement the concludinge if ye may
All the templers destroyed them on a day
For certain crimes horrible to here
All atones were set in prison
By their friends touching this manner
Counceyled to axe mercy and perdon
That they should by plain confession
Requerynge him knelinge on arowe
And as it was their trespass been aknowe
Jacques was take and with him other three
Kept in hold and to prison sent
And the remenaunt of their Iniquyte
Ordained were by open Judgment
To mighty stakes to be tied and brent
The king in manner like to do them grace
So they would confess their trespace
But all for naught they were so indurate
All of accord and of one courage
To axe mercy were obstynate
The fire ready all with one langage
When the flame approached their visage
Full pleynly spoke cried pytously
Of their acts which they were not gylty
Fro their purpos they lyftnat to declyne
But with one voys echon and one soun
Fully affermed till they did fine
How their order and their religion
Igroundyd was upon perfection
And their death verily in deed
Compassed was of malice and hatrede
The said Jacques of whom I spoke toforne
Brought to a place which called was leon
Tofore two legates or that his lif was lorn
All openly made his confession
He was worthy for short conclusion
For to be deed by rightful Judgment
This was his end to ashes he was brent
Bochas here commends Theodorus with other two philosophers for their
patience notably^
^Euynge a prys to philosophers three
Bochas commends with great diligence
How each of them was in his cuntre
Souereynly by virtuous excellence
Of old commendyd for their pacyence
Which may be set and crowned in his stall
As Emperesse among virtues all
Monge ceciliens first theodorus
For patience had in great reverence
Among greeks the storye tells thus
Artaxerses for his magnyficence
By force of virtue grounded in patience
Because he was virtuous and wys
For sufferaunce gate him a souerein prys
Among romans put in remembrance
Sceuola both philosopher and knight
For his marcyall hard strong constaunce
When that he held amyd the flame light
Hand and fynges among the colys bright
Till the Joints falling here and yondre
From the wrest departed were asondre
First theodorus borne in the famous I Will
By pacyens great peynes endurynge
Cheef philosophere called of cecile
With cheynes bound upon the ground lyenge
On his body laid gaddes read brennynge
Suffringe his pain list it not refuse
By king Jerome the tyraunte ciracuse
For common profit suffered all his pain
Long time before lyinge in prison
Which by assent of mo than one or tweyne
Was the most cheef by co^spyracion
To bring the tyrant to his destruction
For no peyn that he might endure
The coniuracion he would not discure
Rather he chase in mischeef for to dye
Than by name openly declare
Of him that slough the tyrant sothly to seye
Thought of right no man should spare
For common profit health and welfare
To sle a tyrant demynge for the best
All a region for to set at rest
For which title he list suffer death
All his torment took most patiently
Theodorus till he yeldyd up the breath
Grutchyd not with noise nor loud cry
Amyd whose heart rotyd was feythfully
Common profit bochas write the same
Among Ceciliens to get him a name
Greeks also commend above the sterres
Anexerses and greatly magnefye
Cause that he to stynte mortal werres
List not spare to acquyte his party
In rebukynge manly the tyranny
Of N^cocreon tyrant full mortal
Regnynge in Cypre in his estate royal
Spared nouther for death ne dread
Him to rebuke by virtuous langage
The tyrant had cut of his head
His tunge in have but he with strong courage
Said he should have none advantage
Of that membre which with all his might
Had told him troth in the peples sight
Of his manace set but little tale
But of his tunge of strong courage
Chewyd it all on pieces small
Of manly heart thought it no damage
Spitte it out into the visage
Of the tyraunte gate so the victory
To put his name evermore in memory
And Sceuola egall to these tweyne
For common profit by just comparison
Put him in prees did his besy pain
To sle procemia enmye to rome town
For to accomplissh his entencion
Took a strong darte right passyngly tenhaunte
With all his might cast at the tyraunte
Of his me^ke cause he did fail
To sle his enmye after his entente
Which in Tuskan by many strong battle
Geyns romans with his knightys went
This Sceuola his own hand burnt
Cause that he failed of his art
To sle porcenna with casting of his darte
To declare the force of his manhede
Put him silf avenged for to be
As I have told in cooles read
His hand he brent for love of his cite
Only to aquyte his magnanymyte
Of feruente love his cite to avail
To sle the tyraunte cause that he did fail
Thus for to put the marcyall suffraunce
Of these noble philosophers three
Imperpetuall mind and remembrance
How they them quyt each like his degree
For then pure party unto the comonte
Cause all their joy and inward delight
Was for avail to the common profit
First theodorus put him silf in prees
For Ceciliens to dye in prison
And for greeks noble artaxerses
His tongue torn felt great passion
And Sceuola for Romans and their town
Suffered his hand by short auysement
Of very troth in coals to be brent
A martyrdom it was in their manner
Of their courage to have so great constaunce
Were so stable of heart body and chere
For common profit of face and countenance
Unto the death without variaunce
Gate the tryumphe by souereyn excellence
With laurer crownyd for their patience
Like as phoebus passes the little sterre
Highest up raised in his mydday spear
So this virtue in trouble pees and werre
Called patience most fresshly does appear
Among virtues to show his bemys clear
For patience knyt with humylyte
Where they abide may none error be
Tyrauntys hertis this virtue does appese
Modefyeth their cruel fell wodenesse
Rage of lions who list live in ease
Of folk prostrat his malice does repress
All our Joy began first with meekness
For of Judah the hardy strong lion
A maidens mekenes fro heuene brought do^n
In battle and mighty strong sheltrons
A vice with sufferaunce wynneth the victory
Patience venquisshith chaumpions
Lowness in virtue by many old historye
And meekness perpetuell of memory
All to conclude ground on reason
A maydyns meekness wrought our redemption
Bochas here commends humylite
Virtue of virtues o noble patience
with laurer crowned o vtuous constau^ce
Laud honor price and reverence
Be you^ to ye princes most plesau^ce
Most renomed by old remembrance
Of whom the mighty marcyall armure

With life everlasting thy tryumphes to auaunce
And Joy eternal thy noblesse to assure
In the aureat throne perpetually to endure
Three Iererchyes there living in presence
With whom humylyte has souereyne acqueyntau^ce
Where osanna with devout diligence
Is song of angels by long continuance
Tofore the throne keeping their obseruaunce
Sing Sanctus sanctus record of scripture

Suffraunce of paynemes has but an appearance
Done for veynglorye hanging in balaunce

And for to set a manner difference

How for our feyth by full great violence
Diverse saints have suffered great penance
Stable of their chere visage and countenance

Like cristys champyons perpetually to endure

Grounded on criste their souls to auaunce
Grave in their hertes and in their conscience
Voydynge all trouble of worldly perturbaunce
Chaunges of fortune with her double chance
Loved god and dred above each creature
In hope with him perpetually to endure

After these three princys glorious
Tofore bochas to show their entente

By whoos unhappy fatal froward chance
In the werres twene florence and pyse
On horsbak sittinge on knightly wise
Hurt with an arowe full low down to ground
Whereby he caught his last fatal wound
A man of arms being a soudyoure
With the Pysanes were it wrong or right
Of falls dysdeyne that day did his besy labor
To trede on charles in the peples sight
When he lay gruffe wherefore he was made knight
By their capteyn for a manner pride

And in his stody with full heavy chere
While John bochas bode still on his sete

And if thou list do me this plesaunce
To descryue his knightly excellence
I will thou put his life in remembrance
How he oppressyd by mighty violence
This famous cite called florence
By which storye pleynly thou shall se
Which were friends and foos to the cite
And which were able to be excused
If the troth be clerly apperceyued
And which were worthy to be refused
By whom the cite full falsely was desceyued

To rekne in order by every side
Which should be chaced and which should abide
How duke Gaulter of Florence for his tyranny / Lecherye and couetyse endyd
in mischeef
ANd when bochas knew all the entencion
Of the said daunt he cast him anon right
To obey his maystre as it was reason
Took his pen and he cast his sight
Alyte aside and he saw nomaner wight
Save duke Gaulter of all the long day
For Daunt unwarily vanisshed was away
This seide Gaulter breuely to proceed
Like as it is put in remembrance
Touching his line and his royal kynrede
He was destendyd of the blood of france
By long process and knightly purueyaunce
His fader first by diligent labor
Of athenys was lord and gouernoure
Stood but a while in clear possession
Greeks to him had full great envy
Cast of a^^^nt to put him down
And depryue him of his famous duchy
To their intent a leyser they did espy
Took him at myscheef quakinge in his dread
Of hye despyte in haste smet of his head
Upon whoos death avenged for to be
This said Gaulter with mighty apparayle
Cast he would asyege that cite
But of his purpose long he did fail
And in this while with many storonge battle
Two mighty princes were come down of pyse
Leyde a syege to Luke in knightly wise
^^rentynes to Luke were favorable
And to deliver the syege from the town
With multitude almost Innumerable
Made ordinance and knightly came down
Which turned after to their destruction
For it fell so of mortal adventure
On florentynes fill the disconfiture
The noise and fame of this great battle
Began sprede far by report of langage
In Lumbardye and in Itayle
Monge soudyours lusty of courage
And among other feynynge a pilgrimage
The said Gaulter by unware violence
Came fro Naples down into florence
The florentynes held first a parliament
For the salvation and guard of their cite
By great prudence and great auysement
Of such as were hyghst of degree
By one assent they gave the souereynte
Them to govern hoping to their encres
With statutes made both for werre and pees
The gretest states rulers of the town
Called magnates tho days in sothenesse
To gaulter gave this domynacion
Of intent the commons to oppress
And merchants to spoil of their richesse
Streyne men of craft by froward violence
Ageyn their lybertees used in Florence
The temple always in awayte lyinge
To be restored unto their lyberte
Began grutch sore among them silf pleynynge
For great extorcion done to their cite
The great also of most auctoryte
Had lever to suffer Gaulter regne
Than their actions to modefye or restreyne
The said Gaulter in full subtle wise
By a falls manner of Symulacyon
Enmye in heart unto their Fraunchise
All that he wrought for short conclusion
Was done only to their destruction
With a pretense feyned of frendlyhede
To his promys contrary ay was the deed
Clambe up by process to full hye estate
By feigned spech and subtle flaterye
In his heart wex pompous and clate
His werkynge outward no man could espy
Lite and little drough to his party
That to conclude shortly for to seye
All florence his lustys did obey
Began subtly please the comonte
For to accomplissh falsely his desires
Made promise to encres their liberte
To such as were froward of manners
Made an oath to destroy their officers
But they would of their fre volunte
Grant unto him larger lyberte
Gretter power and domynacyon
To encres his might on every side
Began manace the grettest of the town
And day by day encres in his pride
Felly he began felly he did abide
Thereupon kept clos in their entrayle
The florentynes greatly began marvel
In this while there was one Reymere
Of great auctoryte and of great reverence
A mighty sargeant and a great offycere
To whoos bidding obeyed all Florence
Which with Gauletr accordyd in sentence
With soudyours had stuffed each hos^rye
For to sustene of Gaulter the party
And treytourly for to fortefye
The intent of Gaulter fell and ambicious
To have thestate only by tyranny
As their cheef lord froward and surquedous
To regne in Florence the cas perylous
When two tyrauntys both of one assent
With multitude to accomplissh their intent
Which thing considred by their gouernou^^
And magnates called in the cite
When they found among them no socour^
To remedy their great aduersite
Fill to accord of necessite
Gave their assent without variaunce
That Gaulter should have all the governance
And condescendyd they were to this issu
That gaulter should in all his best wise
Upon the body be sworn of crist Ihesu
Them to restore unto their fraunchyse
Used of old and for no couetyse
From their promys for life needs declyne
As the conuencion list to termyne
Herupon was blow a trumpet
For to assemble the states of the town
A parlment was holden gaulter first set
Holy to pronounce the conuencyon
With every percell entytled by reason
Like their accord declarynge anon right
Stood up a voket in the peplys sight
With men of arms in steel armyd bright
Unto their pal^is cheef and principal
The seid Gaulter conveyed anon right
Set in a sete most statly and royal
And the people with voys memoryall
Began cry loud co^cludynge in sentence
Gaulter for ever cheef lord of florence
Woe to persevere duringe all his life
Took in the paleys full possessyon
There durst none ageyn it make stryf
Granted to him the dominacion
Of all the castle about enuyron
Tuskan areth and castle Florentyne
With all lordshyppes to Mount Appeny^e
As ye have herd gaulter thus began
By his own furious dyuynayle
Seyde he was borne to be lord of Tuskan
And a great party also of Itayle
Told he was lad and conveyed by a quayle
Seyde evermore were it right or wrong
That was the sentence of the birds song
The Same bird brought him first to florence
All the way before him took his flight
With soote singing did him reverence
Hye in the ^yer of courage glad and light
Would never part out of his sight
Gave him toknes to set his Ferte afyre
That of florence he should be lord and sy^
The ^^^e bird he bare in his dyuyses
Full ^^hely enbrauded with perre
Took upon him many great emprises
As cheef lord of Florence the cite
Sat in Judgment governed the cuntre
Drough to him flaterers and folk that could lie
Baudes Ribaudes where he might them spy
Of that cite took marvelous truages
Crocheth to him richessys of the town
Of lecherye used great outrages
Of maydyns wives made none excepcion
Void of mercy grace and remissyon
Fond quarrel for to be vengeable
That to reherce it is abhomynable
Where he hates / mercyles he sleeth
Brake fraunchises and old lybertees
The people playned desired sore his death
Cried vengeance about their citees
For tyranny done in their cunt^^^s
Which was cause of g^eate diff^^^^on
And of their cite almoost sub^^^cion
Thus they were among them silf divided
For their grievous sodeyne oppression
Lak of forsight that they were not provided
To se mischeues that should fall in the town
This is very soth where is dyuysion
By witness and record of scripture
May no kingdom nor cite long endure
For which they began compleyn one and all
Both of the great and of (...) ^^mo ^^e
And of accord among theymsilf they fall
To refourme the hurt of that cite
