Music of Six, and Five parts.

Made upon the common tunes used in singing of the Psalms.

By John Cosyn.

LONDON Imprinted by John Wolf. 1585.

Cum priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis.

To the right honorable Sir Francis Walsingham Knight, principal Secretary to
her excellent Majesty, and one of her highness privy Counsel. I. C. wishes
prosperity in this life, and life everlasting in Christ our Savior.
Howsoever the abuse of Music may be great, when it is made an instrument to
feed vain delights, or to nourish and entertain superstitious devotion: yet
the right use thereof is commanded in singing Psalms, and making melody to
God in our hearts. Therefore (right honorable,) as by the grace of God I labor
to avoid the former, so have I been careful in my profession to further the
second. And having in this care set Six and Five parts upon the tunes
ordinarily sung to the Psalms of David, I was encouraged by some to publish
them for the private use and comfort of the godly, in place of many other
Songs neither tending to the praise of God, nor containing any thing fit for
Christian ears. Whereunto when I had yielded, my desire was to dedicate those
labors taken for the furtherance of godly exercises, to a Patron of
godliness, and a mainteiner of true religion. And among many such (whom the Lord
increase, in all heavenly wisdom) I have now a long time specially been
deuote to your honor, as one most joyful to hear both of your singular zeal
to the truth, and of your manifold and honorable actions to advance the same.
Herein I may seem bold in so simple a work to crave your honorable
protection, but my trust is, that the least things tending to the praise of
God, and furtherance of piety, are not little to your honor: upon which
persuasion I rest, beseeching the Lord, to grant you increase of honor, and
wisdom, and all other graces requisite for your honorable state in this life,
and leading to an estate in the life to come, most honorable and everlasting.

Your humbly at commandment. I. Cosyn.

Psalm I.
^THe man is blessed that has not bent, to wicked read his ear: nor ^lead his

day and night.

Psalm III.
^O Lord how are my foes increast, which vex me more and more, ^they kill my
heart when as they say, God can him not restore. 2. But thou O Lord ^art my

^holdst up my head.

Psalm VI.
^LOrd in thy wrath reprove me not, though I deserve thine ire, ne ^yet correct

^for fear.

health.

Psalm xxi.
^O Lord how joyful is the king, in thy strength and thy power? ^how

him his godly hearts desire, to him nothing have thou denide, of that he did
^require.

Psalm xxiii.
^MY shepherd is the living Lord, nothing therefore I need: in pa- ^stures
fair with waters calm, he set me for to feed. 2. He did convert and glad ^my
soul, and brought my mind in frame, to walk in paths of righteousness for his
^most holy name.

Psalm xxv.
^I Lift my heart to thee, my God and guide most just, now suffer ^me to take no

of me, and let them not be overthrown that put their trust in ^thee.

Psalm xxx.
^ALl laud and praise, with heart and voice O Lord I give to thee, ^which did

in all my pain and grief: thou gave an ear, and did provide to ease me
^with relief.

Psalm xxxiiii.
^I Will give laud and honor both, unto the Lord always, and eke ^my mouth for

rejoice.

Psalm xliiii.
^OVr ears have heard our Fathers tell, and reverently record, the won- ^drous
works that thou have done in alder time O Lord. 2. How thou did cast the
^Gentiles out and stroydst them with strong hand: planting our fathers in their
place ^and gave to them their land.

Psalm L.
^THe mighty God the eternal has thus spoke, and all the world he ^will call

^which place him likes best, God will appear in beauty most excellent. Our
God ^will come before that long time be spent.

Psalm LI.
^O Lord consider my distress, and now with speed some pity take ^my sins
deface, my faults redress, good Lord for thy great mercies sake. ^2 Wash me O
Lord, and make me clean, from this unjust and sinful act, and purify ^yet
once again my heinous crime and bloody fact.

Psalm Lv.
^O God give ear and do apply to hear me when I pray, ^and when to thee I

does me constrain.

Psalm Lix.

still thirst after blood.

with trust ^shall come to thee.

accord, the brightness of thy face. 2. That all the world may know ^the way
to godly wealth, and all the nations on a row, may see thy saving ^health.

Psalm. Lxviii.
^LEt God arise and then his foes will turn themselves to flight this ^enemies
then will run abroad, and scatter out of sight. 2. And as the fire does ^melt

^shall decay.

Psalm Lxix.
^SAue me O God and that with speed, the waters flow full fast; So nigh ^my

like be ^dround.

Psalm Lxxii.
^LOrd give thy judgments to the king, therein instruct him well* ^and with his
son that princely thing, Lord let thy justice dwell. 2. That he might
^gouerne vprightlie, and rule thy folk aright, and so defend through equity
the ^poore that have no might.

Psalm Lxxviii.
^ATtend my people to my law and to my words incline: my mouth ^shal speak

have us told.

^euery pleasant string.

flock ^he does us feed, and for his sheep he does us take.

his gifts, show not thy self unkind, and suffer not his benefits to slip out
^of thy mind.

Psalm Ciiii.
^MY soul praise the Lord speak good of his name. O Lord our great God how
^doest thou appear: so passing in glory, that great is thy fame: honor and
majesty in thee shine ^most clear with light as a robe thou have thee be clad,
whereby all the earth thy greatness ^maie see, the heavens in such sort thou also
have spread that it to a curten compared may be.

Psalm Cxi.
^WIth heart I do accord to praise and laud the Lord in presence of the ^iust.
for great his works are found, to search them such are bound as do him love
and ^trust, his works are glorious, also his righteousness it does endure for
ever his won- ^drous works he would, we still remember should, his mercy
fails never.

Psalm Cxiii.
^YE children which do serve the Lord, praise ye his name with one accord, yea
blessed be always ^his name, who from the rising of the Sun, till it return

power and force is he.

Psalm Cxix.
^BLessed are they that perfect are, and pure in mind and heart, ^whose lives

send: the mighty God me succor will, which heaven and earth framed, and all
^things therein named.



Psalm Cxxii.
^I Did in heart rejoice, to hear the peoples voice, in offering so willingly:
^for let us up say they, and in the Lords house pray; thus spoke the folk full
lovingly: our ^feete that wandered wide, shall in thy gate abide, O thou
Jerusalem full fair, which art so ^seemely set, much like a city neat, the
like whereof is not elsewhere.

Psalm Cxxiiii.
^NOw Israel may say and that truly, If that the Lord had not ^our cause
maintaind, If that the Lord had not our right susteind, when ^all the world
against us furiously, made their vproares and said we should all ^die.

Psalm Cxxv.
^SVch as in God the Lord do trust, as mount Syon, shall firmly ^stand, and be
removed at no hand, the Lord does count them right and just, so that ^they
shall be sure, for ever to endure.



Psalm. Cxxv.
^THose that do put their confidence, upon the Lord our God only: and ^flee to
him for their defense, in all their need and misery: their faith is sure firm
to ^endure grounded on Christ the corner stone: moved with none ill, but
stands still, ^stedfast like to the mount Syon.

Psalm Cxxvi.
^WHen that the Lord again his Syon had forth brought, from bondage ^great,
and also servitude extreme, his work was such as did surmount man's heart and
^thought, so that we were much like to them that use to dream, our mouths
were ^with laughter filled then, and eke our tounges did show us joyful men.

Psalm Cxxvij.
^EXcept the Lord the house do make, and thereunto do set his hand: ^what men
do build it cannot stand. Likewise in vain men undertake, cities and holds ^to
watch and ward, except the Lord be their sauegard.

it ^is full due time, and let thine ears aye be pressed, unto this prayer mine.



Psalm Cxxxii.
^REmember David's troubles Lord, how to the Lord he swore, and ^vowd a vow to
Jacobs God to keep for evermore. I will not come within my house, ^nor clime up
to my bed, nor let my temples take their rest, or the eyes in my ^head.

Psalm Cxxxiiii.
^BEhold and have regard, ye servants of the Lord, which in his ^house by night
do watch, praise him with one accord. Lift up your hands on high, ^vnto his
holy place, and give the Lord his praises due, his benefits embrace.



Psalm Cxxxvi.
^PRayse ye the Lord for he is good, for his mercy endures for ever, ^giue
praise unto the God of Gods, for his mercy endures for ever, give praise unto
the ^Lord of Lords, for his mercy endures for ever, which only does great
wondrous ^works, for his mercy endures for ever.

Psalm Cxxxvii.
^WHen as we sat in Babylon, the rivers round about, and in remem- ^brance of
Syon, the tears for grief burst out, we hanged our harpes and instru- ^ments,
the willow trees upon: for in that place men for their use, had planted many
^one.

Psalm Cxlviii.

word, above the starry sky: and also ye his angels all, armies royal, ^prayse
him with glee.

the firmament, that shows his power on hye. 2. Advance his name, and ^prayse

themselves his statutes to observe, seeking the Lord with all their heart, and
ne- ^uer from him swerve.



Psalm Cxx.
^IN trouble and in thral, unto the Lord I call, and he does me comfort:
^deliuer me I say from liars lips alwaie and tongue of false report.



Psalm Cxxi.
^I Lift mine eyes to Syon hill, from whence I do attend, that succor ^God me
send: the mighty God me succor will, which heaven and earth framed, and all
^things therein named.



Psalm Cxxii.
^I Did in heart rejoice, to hear the peoples voice, in offering so willingly:
^for let us up say they, and in the Lords house pray, thus spoke the folk full
lovingly: our ^feete that wandered wide, shall in thy gate abide, O thou
Jerusalem full fair, which art so ^seemely set, much like a city neat, the
like whereof is not elsewhere.

Psalm Cxxiiii.
^NOw Israel may say and that truly, If that the Lord had not ^our cause
maintaind, If that the Lord had not our right susteind, when ^all the world
against us furiously, made their vproares and said we should all ^die.

Psalm Cxxv.
^SVch as in God the Lord do trust, as mount Syon, shall firmly ^stand, and be
removed at no hand, the Lord does count them right and just, so that ^they
shall be sure, for ever to endure.



Psalm. Cxxv.
^THose that do put their confidence, upon the Lord our God only: and ^flee to
him for their defense, in all their need and misery: their faith is sure firm
to ^endure grounded on Christ the corner stone: moved with none ill, but
stands still, ^stedfast like to the mount Syon.

Psalm Cxxvi.
^WHen that the Lord again his Syon had forth brought, from bondage ^great,
and also servitude extreme, his work was such as did surmount man's heart and
^thought, so that we were much like to them that use to dream, our mouths
were ^with laughter filled then, and eke our tounges did show us joyful men.

Psalm Cxxvij.
^EXcept the Lord the house do make, and thereunto do set his hand: ^what men
do build it cannot stand. Likewise in vain men undertake, cities and holds ^to
watch and ward, except the Lord be their sauegard.



Psalm Cxxx.
^LOrd to thee I make my moan, when dangers me oppress, I call ^I sigh,
plain and groan, trusting to find release, hear now O Lord my request, for
it ^is full due time, and let thine ears aye be pressed, unto this prayer mine.



Psalm Cxxxli.
^REmember David's troubles Lord, how to the Lord he swore, and ^vowd a vow to
Jacobs God to keep for evermore. I will not come within my house, ^nor clime up
to my bed, nor let my temples take their rest, or the eyes in my ^head.

Psalm Cxxxiiii.
^BEhold and have regard, ye servants of the Lord, which in his ^house by night
do watch, praise him with one accord. Lift up your hands on high, ^vnto his
holy place, and give the Lord his praises due, his benefits embrace.



Psalm Cxxxvi.
^PRayse ye the Lord for he is good, for his mercy endures for ever, ^giue
praise unto the God of Gods, for his mercy endures for ever, give praise unto
the ^Lord of Lords, for his mercy endures for ever, which only does great
wondrous ^works, for his mercy endures for ever.

Psalm Cxxxvii.
^WHen as we sat in Babylon, the rivers round about, and in remem- ^brance of
Syon, the tears for grief burst out, we hanged our harpes and instru- ^ments,
the willow trees upon: for in that place men for their use, had planted many
^one.

Psalm Cxlviii.
^GEue laud unto the Lord, from heaven that is so hye. Praise him ^in deed and
word, above the starry sky: and also ye his angels all, armies royal, ^prayse
him with glee.

Music of Six, and Five parts.

Made upon the common tunes used in singing of the Psalms.

By John Cosyn.

LONDON Imprinted by John Wolf. 1585.

Cum priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis.

To the right honorable Sir Francis Walsingham Knight, principal Secretary to
her excellent Majesty, and one of her highness privy Counsel. I. C. wishes
prosperity in this life, and life everlasting in Christ our Savior.
Howsoever the abuse of Music may be great, when it is made an instrument to
feed vain delights, or to nourish and entertain superstitious devotion: yet
the right use thereof is commanded in singing Psalms, and making melody to
God in our hearts. Therefore (right honorable,) as by the grace of God I labor
to avoid the former, so have I been careful in my profession to further the
second. And having in this care set Six and Five parts upon the tunes
ordinarily sung to the Psalms of David, I was encouraged by some to publish
them for the private use and comfort of the godly, in place of many other
Songs neither tending to the praise of God, nor containing any thing fit for
Christian ears. Whereunto when I had yielded, my desire was to dedicate those
labors taken for the furtherance of godly exercises, to a Patron of
godliness, and a mainteiner of true religion. And among many such (whom the Lord
increase, in all heavenly wisdom) I have now a long time specially been
deuote to your honor, as one most joyful to hear both of your singular zeal
to the truth, and of your manifold and honorable actions to advance the same.
Herein I may seem bold in so simple a work to crave your honorable
protection, but my trust is, that the least things tending to the praise of
God, and furtherance of piety, are not little to your honor: upon which
persuasion I rest, beseeching the Lord, to grant you increase of honor, and
wisdom, and all other graces requisite for your honorable state in this life,
and leading to an estate in the life to come, most honorable and everlasting.

Your humbly at commandment. I. Cosyn.

Psalm I.
^THe man is blessed that has not bent, to wicked read his ear: nor ^lead his
life as sinners do, nor sat in scorners chair. But in the law of ^God the
Lord, does set his whole delight, and in that law does exercise himself ^both
day and night.

Psalm. III.
^O Lord how are my foes increast, which vex me more and more, ^they kill my
heart when as they say, God can him not restore. 2. But thou O Lord ^art my
defense, when I am hard bestead: my worship and mine honor both, and thou
^holdst up my head.

Psalm VI.
^LOrd in thy wrath reprove me not, though I deserve thine ire, ne ^yet correct
me in thy rage, O Lord I thee desire. 2. For I am weak therefore O Lord ^of
mercy me forbear, and heal me Lord for why thou know my bones do quake
^for fear.

Psalm xviii.
^O God my strength and fortitude, of force I must love thee, thou ^art my

health.

Psalm xxi.
^O Lord how joyful is the king, in thy strength and thy power? ^how
vehemently does he rejoice in thee his Savior? 2. For thou have given ^vnto
him his godly hearts desire, to him nothing have thou denide, of that he did
^require.

Psalm xxiii.
^MY shepherd is the living Lord, nothing therefore I need: in pa- ^stures
fair with waters calm, he set me for to feed. 2. He did convert and glad ^my
soul, and brought my mind in frame, to walk in paths of righteousness for his
^most holy name.

Psalm xxv.
^I Lift my heart to thee, my God and guide most just, now suffer ^me to take no
shame, for in thee do I trust. 2. Let not my foes rejoice, nor make ^a scorn
of me, and let them not be overthrown that put their trust in ^thee.

Psalm xxx.
^ALl laud and praise, with heart and voice O Lord I give to thee, ^which did
not make my foes rejoice, but have exalted me. O Lord my God to thee ^I cride,
in all my pain and grief: thou gave an ear, and did provide to ease me
^with relief.

Psalm xxxiiii.
^I Will give laud and honor both, unto the Lord always, and eke ^my mouth for
evermore, shall sing unto his praise. 2. I do delight to laud ^the Lord, in
soul and eke in voice, that humble men and mortified, may hear and ^so
rejoice.

Psalm xxxviii.
^PVt me not to rebuke O Lord, in thy provoked ire, ne in thy hea- ^uy wrath O
Lord, correct me I desire. 2. Thine arrows do stick fast ^in me, thy hand
does press me sore, and in my flesh no health at all appears ^any more.

Psalm xliiii.
^OVr ears have heard our Fathers tell, and reverently record, the won- ^drous
works that thou have done in alder time O Lord. 2. How thou did cast the
^Gentiles out and stroydst them with strong hand: planting our fathers in their
place ^and gave to them their land.

Psalm L.
^THe mighty God the eternal has thus spoke, and all the world he ^will call
and provoke. Even from the East and so forth to the West. From toward Syon
^which place him likes best, God will appear in beauty most excellent. Our
God ^will come before that long time be spent.

Psalm LI.
^O Lord consider my distress, and now with speed some pity take ^my sins
deface, my faults redress, good Lord for thy great mercies sake. ^2 Wash me O
Lord, and make me clean, from this unjust and sinful act, and purify ^yet
once again my heinous crime and bloody fact.

Psalm Lv.
^O God give ear and do apply to hear me when I pray, ^and when to thee I
call and cry, hide not thy self away. 2. Take heed to ^me grant my request
and answer me again, with plaintes I pray full sore oppressed, ^great grief
does me constrain.

Psalm Lix.
^SEnd aid, and save me from my foes, O Lord I pray to thee: defend ^and keep
me from all those, that rise and strive with me. 2. O Lord preserve ^me from
those men, whose doings are not good: and set me sure and safe from them ^that
still thirst after blood.

Psalm Lxv.
^THy praise alone O Lord does reign, in Syon thine own hill: their ^vowes to
thee they do maintain, and thy behestes fulfill. 2. For that thou do their
^prayer hear, and do thereto agree: the people all both far and near,
with trust ^shall come to thee.

Psalm Lxvij.
^HAue mercy on us Lord: and grant to us thy grace: to show to us ^do thou
accord, the brightness of thy face. 2. That all the world may know ^the way
to godly wealth, and all the nations on a row, may see thy saving ^health.

Psalm. Lxviii.
^LEt God arise and then his foes will turn themselves to flight: his ^enemies
then will run abroad, and scatter out of sight. 2. And as the fire does ^melt
the wax, and wind blow smoke away: So in the presence of the Lord, the wicked
^shall decay.

Psalm Lxix.
^SAue me O God and that with speed, the waters flow full fast; So nigh ^my
soul do they proceed, that I am sore aghast. 2. I stick full deep in filth
and ^clay whereas I feel no ground: I fall into such floudes I say, that I am
like be ^dround.

Psalm Lxxii.
^LOrd give thy judgments to the king, therein instruct him well: ^and with his
son that princely thing, Lord let thy justice dwell. 2. That he might
^gouerne vprightlie, and rule thy folk aright, and so defend through equity
the ^poore that have no might.

Psalm Lxxviii.
^ATtend my people to my law and to my words incline: my mouth ^shal speak
strange parables, and sentences divine. 2. Which we our selves have ^heard and
learnd even of our fathers old: and which for our instruction our Fa- others
have us told.

Psalm Lxxxi.
^BE light and glad in God rejoice which is our strength and stay: ^be joyful
and lift up your voice to Jacobs God I say. 2. Prepare your instruments ^most
meet some joyful psalm to sing: strike up with harp and lute so sweet on
^euery pleasant string.

Psalm C.
^ALl people that on earth do dwell, sing to the Lord with cheerful ^voyce:
him serve with fear his praise forth tell, come ye before him and rejoice. 2.

flock ^he does us feed, and for his sheep he does us take.

Psalm Ciii.

his gifts, show not thy self unkind, and suffer not his benefits to slip out
^of thy mind.

Psalm Ciiii.
^MY soul praise the Lord speak good of his name. O Lord our great God how
^doest thou appear: so passing in glory, that great is thy fame: honor and
majesty in thee shine ^most clear with light as a robe thou have thee be clad,
whereby all the earth thy greatness ^maie see, the heavens in such sort thou also
have spread that it to a curten compared may be.

Psalm Cxi.
^WIth heart I do accord to praise and laud the Lord in presence of the ^iust.
for great his works are found, to search them such are bound as do him love
and ^trust, his works are glorious, also his righteousness it does endure for
ever* his won- ^drous works he would, we still remember should, his mercy
fails never.

Psalm Cxiii.
^YE children which do serve the Lord, praise ye his name with one accord, yea
blessed be always ^his name, who from the rising of the Sun, till it return
where it begun, is to be praised with great fame, ^the Lord all people does
surmount, as for his glory we may count, above the heavens hie to be, with God
the ^Lord who may compare? whose dwellinges in the heavens are, of such great
power and force is he.
