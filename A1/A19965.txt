TO THE RIGHTLY ennobled in all virtues, Sir William HATTON knight,
advancement in virtue, worship in life, and fame in perpetuity.
TO enforce Sir unto your worthynes herein, by many circustaunces how much led
on with the BOVNTIE, VALOR, COVRTESIE, SKILL, and many other complements of
VIRTVE, resiant in your well noted and known disposition, I have dared to
adventure unto your favorable acceptaunce, this simple and plain dedication
(simple I mean in respect of the handling) might seem in the delivery, to
equal an other volume.

Omitting therefore all those particularities to them that know you, and to
mine own private meditation, that especially do honor you, I will only say
for this, that the greatest forwardnes craves a shroud, and the meanest matter
cannot be without defense.

TO VIRGIL there was an AUGUSTUS, to HORACE a MECAENAS, to CICERO a CAESAR, to
APPELLES an ALEXANDER. If to these? how much more then to me needs there, to
cover the deformity of my style, a most exquisite PATRON.

In a matter simple, it is yet a grace, but to insinuate the name of such as do
merit well, the very respect of whom, in the generallitie of the most,
bears always we see, a more than common reputation,

Herein if I presume on your VIRTVES, I urge the necessity, if to crave your
patronage, then custom may free me.

Now, if the course of the weeke-daies pastimes of these SHEPEHEARDS seem
happily to mislike you, turn then I pray to their HOLIDAIE, where (how rudely
so ever handled) yet the Majesty of her, who is without comparison, being there
in most especially honored, shunneth not the favor of any sweet conceipte
to have the same recommended.

Fruitles were it on a short request, to erect large matter. For which my suit
shall be, that with the self BOVNTIE, wherewith your present years are so
largely beautified, your VIRTVE will vouchsafe favorably to repute both of me
and my travel, which having obtained the shroud thereof as AJAX shield, shall
become unto me henceforth of a sufficient guard from all kind of biting
serpents whatsoever.

Your worships in all to be commanded. Angel Day.

THE FIRST BOOK of the loves Pastoral, of Daphnis and Chloe.
MITELENE among all the notable cities of Greece, is for the delicacie and
strength of the same, not the least in beauty and greatness of all others to be
commended. The situation of which (being in the Isle of Metelene) has
environed round about it, a continual spring of fresh, sweet and deyntie
water, the issue whereof flows from the Seas, and over the same are builded
many bewtifull and fine bridges, wrought and curiously polished of fair white
stone. The show and bravery of all which, gives so large and goodly
demonstration unto the eyes, as he that beheld the same at a sudden, would
rather judge it, an Island of it self, then the mere situation of one sole
City.

Not far from thence (as is accustomed unto the most rich and popular cities
of Greece) one of the worthiest and noble personages of the same, had in the
country by, about two or three miles from the town, a goodly Manor house,
pleasant for the seat, and wholesome for the dwelling, whereunto were adioyninge
diverse fair and welthie possessions, enlarged for commodity, and exceeding
for pleasure. as namely, large hie and goodly mountains, where were nourished
and bred sundry sorts of wild beasts, grounds all covered with vines,
plains, stored with all manner of fruits and grains, and with most fertile
pastures, whereon to feed and nourishe their cattle, the chiefest whereof
lay for the most part, alongest the waters side, which for that cause, rendered
the place, something the more delectable Within these grounds, Lamon a poor
goatheard, whilst warely he often continued to keep his charge, found by
chance a young child, the life of which was only preserved by the suck it
received from one of his shee-goates, and now see the manner how. There was
about the place where he fed his flock, a certain thicket all ouergrowne
with brembles and thorns, and compassed about with furzes, under the covert
whereof grew a soft fine and delicate kind of grass, the turfe thick, as in
such shadie places is often accustomed, whereon laid this tender infant. Thither
ordinarily ran one of his shee-goates, the custom whereof made the heardsman
oftentimes to miss her, and knew not where she was become, for that leaving
her young kiddes vncherished, she only against nature gave heed to the
feeding and nourishment of this preetie babe.

Lamon piteing the selie young ones, that thus were abandoned by their Dam,
began to mark and watch the goat whether she went, and one time amongst the
rest in the heat of the day, sued her trace so near, that he saw how she
past under the thicket and that with so tender and wary touch, as y^ with her
hoofs going in, she might no ways hurt the babe: and there being entered in
most loving sort, inclined her teates unto the infant, who hungerly sucked the
same, no otherwise, then if it had been the breasts of a natural mother. At
the sight of this, the heardsman wonderfully abashed, drew yet at the last more
near, and serching further, found it was a male child, well grown for his
age, of beauty marvelous, and far more richly attired, than beseemed any
ways the infelicitie of his fortune, abandoned so miserably as he was, and
laid forth, to every common adventure. The vesture wherein he was wrapped was a
rich mantle of purple velvet, the compass fastened about his neck with a
brooch of gold, and by his side was laid a short fine sword of most excellent
workmanship all curiously guilt, on the hiltes and the handle thereof, of the
most precious yuorie.

Lamon (greedy at the first of the rich jewels he saw) resolved only to
bear them away, and to leave the child as he found it, to some other
fortune, but having considered a while of that purpose, a bashful shame
quickly surprised his thoughts, that being a man, ^ee should be less
pitiful and human than the poor beast it self, that he thereto had with so
great regard attended and nourished it. In so much, that when night came on,
he took both child and other attire about it, and carried them home unto his
wife, whose name was Myrtale, and therewithal the shee-goate that thither to
had cherished and brought it up.

Myrtale, astonnished at the vewe, demanded if it were possible that goats in
their self kind, could produce young ones of so marvelous shape and
proportion, but Lamon suppressing in her the simplicity of that conceit,
revealed both the manner how he found the babe, and in what sort, and with
how great delicacie, he saw the beast enclining unto it, and therewithal
forgate not to prescribe unto her and him a greater cause of humanity,
considering that a bestiall nature, deuoyde of reasonable living, had by the
gentle condition thereof, taught them so ready a way unto the same. Myrtale,
(whose humors sauoured in nothing of a crab tree stock) did not at all
discommend her husbands regard herein, but joining in one mood of mannerly
enterteinement togethers, as housewifely as she could, (having never had any
of her own) she lulled the babie, and locking up the ornaments and jewels in
a fast barred cheste, they both thencefoorth endeavored to foster it up, in no
other sort, nor by any other kind of deliverance then as their own. And to
the intent it might as well in name as otherwise, resemble the place of
education, where it was bred, they called it by the name of Daphnis.

Two years were not fullye past and expired, ere one Dryas a sheepeheard
keeping his sheep in great quantitye upon the plains and downs thereabouts,
happened after this also upon the like, or very self same adventure. There
was indifferent almost between either of those places, a certain great cave,
standing in a rock, sacred sometimes to the Nymphs, and therefore called by
the name of the Nymphs Cave, something crooked within, but altogether round
without. In the inward part whereof were diverse statues of Goddesses and other
Nymphs, wrought finely out of stone, the feet unshod, the arms all naked,
and th'atire buckled on the shoulders, their hairs cast only upon their
necks, without tressing at all, girded they were upon their loins, their
looks sweetly smiling, and their countenaunces such, as seemed with
interchaungeable favor in delicate sort to greet each other.

Right under the hollow rising of this cave, sprang in the midst of the
bottom a sweet fountain, which raising it self, with a soft bubling,
gathered into a pleasant spring, wherewith the fresh and fruitful greues
round about the same, were continually watered. Over the mouth of the cave,
where the ouerflowinge waves with Cristall humor, had wrought from the earth,
sondrie kinds of flowers and herbs of delicate vewe, hong diverse flutes,
Pipes, and Flagiolots, made of reeds, which the ancient shepherds had often
tofore-time sacred unto the Nymphs for their greatest offerings.

To this cave, a sheep from out of Dryas flock, that newly had yeaned her
lamb, oftentimes in the day frequented, and that with such continuance, as the
shephearde thinking it many times to be lost, endeavored at the last, to make
some device whereby to constrain it to feed in company, without wandering any
more as it was accustomed. And going to the Cave to seek the sheep, with an
Osier twig wreathed in his hand, wherewith to fasten the neck and foot
thereof togethers, a sight more strange then looked for, presented it self
unto him. For the Ewe (framed as it seemed by nature, to the pitying of
distressed creatures) having there found a sweet babe, did in most soft and
gentle manner, visit it many times with her teats, and that with so meek and
tender handling as if it had bin the proper Nurce. The child unused to any
difference, esteemed it as a natural diet, and without crying or other
distemperature at all, first on the one side, and after on the other, as the
Ewe turned her self, with the pretty mouth (which was sweet and pleasant to
behold) sucked the same. The Sheep seeming thereunto to have borne a most
strange and peculiar affection, which one while with the licking of her tongue
on the visage, and another while with soft and deyntie coying it with her
head, it exceedingly did manifest.

Dryas, though he were clubbishe in condition, yet not herein estraunged from
that piety, which the gentle beast had thus already portraied unto him
thought himself also in nature bound to tender the infant, and perceiving it
was a girl; and there withal what ornaments (testimonies that the place
whence it came was of no mean reputation) were also annexed unto it, having on
the head a coyfe curiously wrought and imbroidred with gold, jewels and other
precious things, not to be despized: he adjudged the chance thereof not to
have happened unto him, without some divine preparation: Wherefore taking it up
in his arms, he gladly received the charge thereof, and making his prayers to
the Nymphs, that with good success he might afterward bring her up, whom as
an humble Suppliant, left (as it seemed) to their patronage) he had found laid
at their feet, he departed.

Now when night came, that he was to drive his sheep home to their fold,
having secretly in the mean time conveyed all the jewels and ornaments into
his bouget, as soon as he was returned to his house, he began to recompt unto
his wife all that he had seen, and showed her also what he had found: Nape
was the Sheperdesse called, to whose especial care her husband with many words
recommended the regard of the distressed infant, commanding her thence forward
to repute it as her own natural daughter, and in such sort only to nourish and
provide for it. The woman was not stony hearted, but according to her shepherds
guise began to embrace and entertain the girl, deeming already that she became
a mother unto it, by mere affection, her conceit grew tender over it, and with
such fervent love, and continual watching did she endeavor to foster it, as
that she feared lest the sheep that whilome sucked the swatheled unpe, should
in the beastly regard it showed be preferred before her. And for that her care
stretched that the girl in farther springing years might the sooner be taken
and reputed for hers, she gave it thence-fro a name Pastoral, and called her
Chloe.

These two children in process of time grew to be great, and showed well by
their beauty and other complements, that their parentage was not mean, nor
their descent derived from out of old thatched cotages. And about the time that
the elder of them, was come to the age of fifteen years, and the younger about
two years less: Lamon and Dryas at one very instant, and in the selfsame
night interchangeably (as it fell out) dreamed in this sort togithers. It
seemed unto them both, that the Nymphs, whose statues and images were in the
cave (where you heard before the fountain was, and where Dryas (as is
reported) had found his daughter) took Daphnis and Chloe, and them both jointly
delivered to the guidance and protection of a very young boy, gentle in all
kind of behauiours, but of beauty most wonderful, frustrate was his body of
garments, his shape curious, his skin pure as alablaster, his shoulders
feathred as wings, his left hand supported with a slender bow, a small quiver
at his back, and a fine arrowe in his right hand. Who touching them both with
one and the fame dart, gave charge unto Daphnis thence-forward to feed his
goats on the pastures, and to the other immediately to keep flocks of sheep.

The heardsmen both at once deeply conceiving of this vision, were suddenly
quailed of al their former expectation, insomuch as the fruits of their
careful nurseries, seemed thus contrary to that they hoped, and what their
several badges, might before that, respectively have presaged, to be destined
at one instant to the keeping of cattle togethers. For that the marks of
their birth, had offered unto their former notice, so manifest intendments of
far greater fortune, in full pursuit whereof, their careful endeavors had
thitherto sought to conduct them, and that in far more delicate and dainty
manner, than beseemed the children of heardsmen, as well in an honored kind of
usage to their persons, as in liberal training them up in letters, and other
convenient skill and demeanours, whereof their years at that instant were
nothing ignorant, and that so far forth as the largess of their country
dwelling, could any ways affoorde unto them. Nevertheless, for so much as the
iniunction appeared to be derived altogether from the pleasure of the gods,
they determined in their obedience, rather to give place unto their commaundes,
whose providence had saved them both from their former perilles, than to yield
unto their own proper fancies, whose greatest respect of care they were sure
could least of all avail them.

Not long after, these two neighbor-dwellers found means to confer at full,
touching both their visions, and by one wine consent, they first agreed to go
unto the cave of the nymphs, and there to offer sacrifices, for the better
prosperity and happy proceedings of their several charges, which offering of
theirs, they by one vow togethers, devoted to the fair young boy, unto whose
protection, by the same Nymphs, their nurceries had been before committed,
whom they called by the name of the winged god, for otherwise by any more
special title or particular effect they had not discerned him. Which done,
they jointly inferring, whatsoever after care of the two youthful and sweetest
of all natures creatures, upon him, both Lamon and Dryas recorded as a sum
of all their expectation, these four verses to remain on the wall of the
nymphs, as a perpetual memorial:

To thee thou winged God, what ere thou be
(A god thou art) we sheepheards fruits do bring
Let Daphnis and his herds be dear to thee,
And Chloes flocks eft cast this sacred spring.
Having herewith greatly satisfied their longing desires, and manifold
well-wishinges unto their tender fosterlings, Lamon returned to his Myrtale,
and Dryas to Nape, and by assent of both their wives, dispatched the next day
with all kind of necessaries, the two darlings of the earth to their several
herds, sweet Daphnis to his goats, and fair Chloe to her sheep, instructing
them severally, in all things belonging to a heardsmans office. As how to drive
their beasts to pasturing before the heat of the day, and in the cool of the
evening again ho^e to guide them: what times, and where to water them, when to
bring them home at night, and how in the mornings likewise to drive them to the
field. In what sort, and upon what occasion to use the Whistle-Pipe, and how at
another time to call with their voice alone.

These Images of Beauty, mildly yielding them selves to what herein to them
enjoined, received as willingly their charges, and with as deep contenting
pleasure, as though they therewith had received some great and notable signorie,
Daphnis tendering his goats, and Chloe her sheep, and that with so entier and
more then common affection accustomablie used among sheapeheards, as well
showed, that he for his part had some reason to induce him, and she for her
part could not omit it without seeming unthankful.

The season was then of the year, about the beginning of the spring, when the
very delicacie of Floras self was grown to her most natural prime, and she
as Lady and queen of that iollie being, had by a mere earthly show of most
exquisite perfourmance, colored her walks and passages, with blossoms of
sweetest verdure and die most perfect, for the more ample beautifiyng and
enrichment of all her seemly creatures. Herbs then began to be in their force,
trees in their pride, fields in their bravery, flowers in their sweetenes, and
the earth in her delicacie. The birds had felicity to resound their variable
notes to the woods, and to acquaint the hedge rows with their warbling tunes,
the lambs and tender kids skipped upon the hillockes, the young rams hurtled
on the banks with their wreathed horns, and had pleasure to perch to the
highest mountains, the bees sweetlye murmured from under their hiues, and all
that frequented the passures had universal gladness.

The mark of Love himself, combined within the very eieliddes of these two
excellent creatures, seeing all things thus daintelie decked and trimmed up, by
so curious workemanshippe, kindled in their minds the selfsame spark and
common desire of al natural enforcements, whereby each of them became
studious, according to their human nature and disposition to immitate by lik^
equality, what they then perceived to be gras^ed in all other tenderlinges. In
so much as with the birds they sang, seeing the kids leap, they daunced, and
after the bees they gathered flowers, with some part whereof they trimmed their
bosoms, and of others made pret^e small chapelets, the brauest of which they
carried unto the Nymphs, and therewith crowned their heads. Finally as it were
united in one continued link of (...), these seemly portraictures of well
pleasing youth, lovingly always accompanied each other, and evermore on the
(...) fed their heardes together.

Many times befell it, that when her sheep were any ways straied, Daphnis
with great desire would speed him self before her to gather them in again:
And when the most hardy of his young kids, and ^ender goa^s had mounted to the
top of some hie or steep rock, neatlye would likewise Chloe apply her self
to make them draw down the same with eas^e pace again. O^e while guided she
both herds her self, whilst he used his pastime, and another while ordered he
the flocks, whilst she sported her self under the shadie tops. Their
exercises were in Sheapehearde games, and the pleasures they entertained, such
as beseemed the nonage of their outgrowing childhood, for some part of their
time, they spent in gathering bulrushes, wherewith Chloe would make pretty
bird*cages and therein put the grasshoppers. Daphnis on the other side often
times cut down the reeds, and vnclosing their ^oints, glewed them orderly
together again with soft wax, and of these found diverse pastimes wherewith to
occupy them selves togethers. Their vsages were holy, as unexperienced of
evil, and such whose delicate imaginations, were never surprizd with the least
taint at all of harmefull thinking. Enterchangeably did they ^ch to other
impart their milk, their wine, and what other vitailes, the simplicity of
their show, and country being could besides afford. To conclude, it might
seem a thing more ordinary, to see their flocks asunder scattred, than at any
time to see Chloe from him, or Daphnis from her to be divided. Now as they thus
passed their time in such kind of daliance Love, the grand Prince and
Sovereign of their vnmacheable bewties, had by this time prepared a secret
ambush wherewith to frame some notable breach, into the vndefensiue
imaginations of these two innocent lovers, and thus stood the case. There was
not far from the place where these two gentle Shepherds kept their haunts a
she-wolfe that newly having cast her whelps, accustomed there-vpon to run
oftentimes into the flocks thereabouts, and there to raum the small cattle,
to carry to her young ones: By occasion whereof the husbandmen and sheapheards
inhabiting the villages about, and seeing their cattle thus to be destroyed,
devised in the night to make sundry deep pittes and trenches and them
subtilye to cover again with thin earth cast upon small twigges whereby to
make the place seem plain, so that whatsoever came running there-vppon, were
it of the smalest weight that might be reasonably conceived, the twigges
would presently fall under them, and whelme them therewith into the pit. A
number of such like trappes both in the mountains and plains, were cast,
wherewith to catch the subtle beast: but she accustomed to those wiles,
shunned the train and them continually discovered, notwithstanding many
sheep and goats were thereby destroyed, and Daphnis him self by that only
inconvenience was like to have perished.

It happened that two of the fairest buckes of all his heard being vehemently
chafed one against the other upon a long fight together, rushed at the last so
rudely upon each other, that with the greatness of the stroke, a horn of one
of them was broken, whereof feeling great pain, the bucke thus disarmed of one
of his horns turne^ himself to flight. The victor (proud of the conquest
won) pursued notwithstanding, and haunted the pore beast both with strokes
and pace so busily, that he hardly gave it so much leisure as to gather a
little breath. Daphnis grieved at the mishap, to see so fair a beast thus
unhappily spoiled, and vexed also in mind to behold the unquenchable fury and
ho^e pursuit of the other, which with the hurt done could not be satisfied, but
with further cruelty, sought to oppress him whom alredie he had maimed, took
up a cudgel in the one hand, and his whistle pipe in the other, and followed
the pursuer, laying still at him as he followed, in mind to beat him, The
beast, shonning the strookes, and he more enraged to hit him, then circumspect
how or where he followed him, the buck for fear, and he for haste, tombled
both together into one of those pics, the beast first, and Daphnis upon him,
the chance whereof (as it fell out) saved his life, for that the beast first
sustained the hard stroke, and himself with less damage, fell the more easily
upon him. But Daphnis seeing himself thus pitifully distressed in so deep a
passage, could do no other but cry out, and with plenty of tears lament his
hard hap, attending if happily some one or other coming that way, might
chance to here him, and so proture mean to relieve him.

Chloe, whose eye was seldom estraunged from some (more the^ ordinary) care
of her regarded companion, albeit she was then a great way from Daphnis when he
fell, perceived yet his sudden vanishment, and was not vnmistrustfull at all,
of his present harm. And for that she was altogether ignorant what it might
be, and yet doubting the evil she knew not, because she saw him not again,
she hastened to the place where her sight had lost him, withal speed possible.
There beholding the great depth of the pit, and seeing contrary to expectacion,
that he was sound and alive, she thence sped her pace quickly to a Coweherd
that fed cattle hard by, requiring his present aid to help Daphnis forth of
that grievous place, who serching up and down for a cord, and finding none of
length sufficient: Chloe with great desire vntressed quickly her golden wirie
locks, and with the silkin twine that bound up the same, eftsoon dobled
togethers in many co^passes, supplied what wanted to the former shortness, by
fastening it to the cords end that by the Cowherds means, they had there
already prepared. And this done, joining both their aides together, they did so
much Daphnis without great hurt, was gotten forth again.

The lovely shepehard thus raized up from so deep a dongeon, and by y^ gentle
travail of y^ Nymph freed of the great fear wherinto he was falue, casting
many times his bashful and deep pecring countenances toward her, could not
for the present devise with what kind of speeches (sufficient to so great a
benefit) to salute her. And much the rather was he now so mazed, for that at
that instant more then at any time before, it seemed there harbored in her
delicate spirits, a more stronger effcacie, then ever he had ere then
perceived, in her looks, were carried an especial eye mark of he knew not,
what kind of most sweet and pleasing delight, some onething more then common,
rested as he thought in the precious content, of her well applied countenance,
her speech was not as the ordinary sound of her accussomed deliverance, her
gestures (amiable of themselves) were fraught as now to his seeming, with a
more estranged kind of excellence. Neither knew he, whence the humor hereof
proceeded, albeit he felt himself even then deeply touched, but embracing
with an unacquainted desire, the conceit where-into he was carried by the
present object, he only framed some few speeches, in acknowledgement of this
first conceived benefit, which by the watchful regard of Chloe he had already
received. And turning himself likewise to Dorcon- (for so was the cow-heard
called) giving a multitude of thanks unto him for his travel taken, his
looks and speech at one instant, were therewith both surprised togethers.

This being the first public place wherein love, either by look or gesture
had made way into the secret though is of these two Iouers to be discerned.
Daphnis as yet ignorant of his passion, and holding himself highly pleased,
but nothing less than satisfied in beholding of Chloe, reposed his chiefest
content to gaze upon her, and the most precious part of his delight in kissing
her, wherein, redoubling e^t soones the pleasures, thereby conceived a sweeter
humor than that which the honey Be by nature congealeth, or the Candy sugar in
taste delivers, issued (as he thought) from her lips, her looks were as
piercing arrows, and Cupid himself seemed to lodge in the very eie-browes of
her countenance. Roste, nay far more orient was the hew, that her hasty pase
and yet panting breathing to relieve him had settled upon her cheeks, the delay
mingled, whereupon was the very die of the white and purest marble. Her locks
dispersed on her shoulders, in color like the burnisht yellow of the finest
gold, made her to appear as one of the nymphs, whom Jupiter erst favored, or
Apollo with a^den flames whilom eagerly pursued. Pleasing, and more than
pleasing was she to be seen at that instant, and such as wherein not Daphnis
alone, but the pore cow-heard Dorcon also more than ordinarily reioiced.

The simple cow-heard, unacquainted before time, with such admirable features,
and not accustomed to the contemplation of so divine and far surpassing
measures, esteemed one while of Chloe, that according to so rare and exceeding
beauty, some what remained graffed in her countenance that appeared more
singular than was to be attributed to the common proportion of every other
creature. Another while, considering the meandness of her fortune, being but
in common reckoning the daughter of Dryas her self, but as a simple
sheepeheardesse, m^red only to the downs, he then deemed her greatness to be no
more than as the reputation of every other common dweller. And though his
rural condition had not till then made estimate of any thing, more than his
country feeding, neither in all his pleasures had ought exempted more peculiar
than his cattle keeping: yet by the deep impression of her sight the grand
master of al humane affections, had led him to an imagination of far more
greater consequent, yea the blun^nesse of his former conceit (such as seldom
falls out in men of base and servile reckoning) began here-with to be
molifted, his spirits grossly weighed before with an earthly nutriment waxed now
more tender. His only household care furnished till then with a covetous regard
of profit and husband-like desire, by hardened labors, to see his cattle
prosper, was turned into a new kind of obseruaunce: his morning walks where
with he wonted erst to visit his pastures, were converted into a heed full
attendance of blisfull Chloe, and her most dainty passages. Now began he to
aduert the holidays, and to long for the pleasant seasons, wherein heardsmen
without check or controlment do celebrate their interchangeable pastimes* him
seemed the bois^rous leather, and laborsome sweat, dried with the dusty season
upon his wrinckled eie-browes, disgraced at one instant both his person and
countenance, he merely wared weary of his habit, and grew into great
mislike, that he were not presently here, otherwise he might be decked or
changed. Much was it that he thought in himself, where with he might afterward
be better contented, and her whom he loved) by a like conjecture) to be both
the sooner pleased and satisfied.

Thus and in such manner wrought the unknowing conceits of these two
heardse-men each unto the other. Daphnis by reason of too much youth and small
experience, neither capable of fraud, nor injured to any slight or subtlety,
and least of all surmizing what he could or would go about to do, to win
unto himself the effect of that whereunto, though in truth he were so far
forth inclined, he was yet able of the same to frame no perfect end or
distinguishment, not so much as mistrusted at al these sudden alterations bred
in the mind of his new acquaintance Dorcon, for that neither knew he his
own desire to be defined by any title or name of love, or that any other might
be a copart^er, or become an impatient rival of his so vehement a passion. But
wading with all kind of simplicity into the fury of his affection, inclined
to whatsoever in accompanieng his derely regarded Chloe, was by the subtilty of
the cow heard afterward of him required.

Here-vpon Dorcon having taken leave for the present, conceived thence-forward
in his mind, that the place of his intertainment, solicited unto his
remembrance, a respect more curious in all his actions, than to-fore time
accustomed, and forgot not in his holiday shirt, and clean washed doublet
vnbuttoned to the girdle, and there fastened to the waste of his hose with a
new green silken point, importing thereby, that all his you (...) was not yet
fully spent, oftentimes to take occasion to visit these lovers. And for that
their purest conceits, harmless of evil, and never so much as tainted with
any similitude of guile, gave both scope and courage, whereby without
suspicion, this new tricked cow-heard might be received into their companies.
He the better now to insinuate him self into their favors, one while
endeavored to present them with his new made fresh cheeses, covered with a fair
white napkin, and strowed over with the most sweet and delicate flowers,
therewithal would he bring of his best and morning skimmed cream,
spice-cakes, and other preatie conceits. To Daphnis besides gave he a young
fat calfe from the damme, and many other fair tokens to Chloe, such as
either his country travel had purchased, or wherewith her sweet conceited
spirits were any ways delighted.

This sudden alteration of Dorcon, both in habit and other demeanors thereunto
according, not so much by any ability of conjecture, that thereby could solie
arise in the opinion of Daphnis, as by the general notice and common speech of
all the other heardsmen, made every where known, that he was become a lover,
and who but fa^re Chloe was she, to whom the man was so fa^re devoted in
affection, insomuch as Daphnis also among the rest grew now to be partaker
thereof, the manner of which, neither place, time, or company, had taught him
before to discern. Yet knew he not for this, what was it to be mated with a
companion of so vnus^d ^ollitie, neither did he for ought he heard or saw,
emulate at all the cow-heardes proffered courtesy. This only marked he,
which all men else had specially noted, that sithence Dorcon first had framed
his spirits to love, he became indeed far more gay, pleasant, and trimmer
attired, his tresses as woonted, lay not scattred or hard knurled upon his
head, but fair kembed and rounded fine under his ears, neatly shaven was he,
as the brauest of the other sheepheards, and not on the holiday alone, but
every morning fasting pinned he (laced in a silk riband) on his but toned
cappe, a fair and flourishing nosegay, well gartered and str^ked up were his
ho^en with a cross bound caddis ribon, his buckled shoes, seemed unwieldy and
curiosity of the rest, made him at the least to bestow on him self a pair of
calves leather pumpes for his wearing.

These only being specially considered upon of Daphnis, and there wythall how
passing cunning he had framed the notes of his old tuned pipe, where-upon he
diverse times played sundry country lays, in the hearing of Chloe, drove him
at one time above the rest into a little melancholy, not for that he stood
ignorant how much the Nymphe was unto him above all others inclined, or that
he mistrusted Dorcon, or envied his pursuit, but for the vehemency of his
passion being so fervent, as had already mastred and ouerwearied his
imaginations, neither experience of manly knowledge, had yet so far
instructed him, as that he was able to determine the same upon any certain
limits, nor any other insight directed him, in what sort the operation thereof
might with more facility be carried, both of which (as he thought) Dorcon by
this liking of his body and bravery wherein he marched, had already achieved:
insomuch as seeing one day the sweetest of his delights to have taken upon her
the feeding of both their herds, he privily secluded him self for a while
into the thickest of a prea^ie pleasant grove adjoining, and reposing his
youthful limbs on the soft and tender grass, nere unto one of the nimphlike
springs whereof the wood every where was most abundant, the solemn tunes of
a most sweet sounding flute (wherein both private practice and the common
usage of the country, had made him excellent) gave music to his mar^yred
thoughts, whereupon his mollified spirits so pressed with the weights that
which troubled him, enforced him in the bark of a fine Popler tree standing
thereby to grave these few verses following.

What may I call the sweet whence springs my sweetest joy,
Or wherein rests that on such sweet depends so great annoy.
How haps that where I touch the air has sweetest breath
And in the selfsame fume I find my cause of death
Whence sues that where I live where most delight I see
In selfsame mood my life consumes, and ^oies confounded be
Whereon engendered is the heat that breeds the flame
Since tempered is with sweetest blasts the cause that mooues the same
What physic may I find what art to cure the sore,
Which guided by the aid it seeks the wound makes still the more
This done, led on by the solitarines of the place, music, and present
fau^ie, he brake into these farther complaints. Sweet, ah sweet said he,
what strange kind of malady has insued unto me, only in kissing my Chloe, my
sweetest Chloe, whose lips are more delicate then the softest roses, and her
mouth and deintie breathing of far more sweetness, than the finest wafers, yet
is the impression of this softnes far more percing than the sting of a be.
Often have I kissed my tender kiodes, newly as it were fallen from the dames,
and that fine speckled calfe that Dorcon did give me, yet felt I no damage, but
this kiss is of far other efficacy and operation, by touch whereof, my pulse
beats, my heart trembles, and my very soul languisheth, all which
notwithstanding, my suffizaunce of remedy rests yet only in kissing her. O
cruel victory, O strange mischief whereof I neither know the name or am
able to determine the quality. Is it possible, the lips whereof the pressure
is so delicate, and the closure so excellent, may be attainted with poison, or
that within the medicinable compass of so sweet a refreshing may be included
a matter so monstrous as may breed infection. No, no, for then with the far
piercing venim thereof, had my death long ere this time been acquired. What
then may I term it whereof insueth so great a languishment? See, see, the
Nightingale how melodiously she chaunteth, and my Flute has forgotten her
wonted music. Behold how the young kiddes skippe upon every hillocke, and I
sit here laden with tears. The flowers are now in their chiefest prime,
and Dorcon alone makes chapelets and nosegaies: the Uiolet and the Dasey have
covered the pastures with their beauties, and Daphnis languishing by his
malady withers only in flames. Dorcon is in his gaietie, and shortly will
become fairer than I. These, and such like shepeheards iamentations delivered
he forth, till wearied with the remembrance and search of that grief,
whereto he knew neither remedy nor end, he left the desolate grove, and with
a counterfeit excuse returned again to his Chloe, who long ere this time had
awaited his presence.

Now Dorcon, whose riper years had enabled his clownish sconce, both with
larger skill, and greater experience, triumphing on the harmless simplicity
of either of these two lovers, listed not to spend much time in the long and
needelesse wooing (as he thought) of her, whom though of her self he were
repulsed, yet by imparting some part of that whereof he had sufficient, to the
covetousness of him that guided her) he presumed he might when he list
purchase at all times of her supposed father, fixing therefore his eyes on his
store of cattle and other coin, wherewith his laboring years were
plentifully enough stored, he only wanted but time and meet occasion, to
further his pretended conference, for which he thence-forth attentively
waited, Making therefore a sure reckoning of Dryas, whom ancient neighborhood,
and long acquaintance had linked unto him in some particular knowledge, it fell
out, that by a preatie occasion, his intendment grew speedilye to be
effected. Dryas had a piece of ground adioynyng not far from the dwelling
of the cow-heerd, whereupon, whilst he was there busied, in planting an
arbor, Dorcon made the often sutuiew thereof a means of his communication: and
greeting him every day, and his people with sundry necessaries wherewith to
ease their far set provision, as well of cheeses, bread, and other vittelles,
he one day among the rest began to enter in purpose and renouation of their
ancient continuance their years both being alike, their keeping of cattle
togithers, and such like remembrances, wherewith men of common account are wont
to commend their acquaintance. In continual harping whereupon, he lastly fell
on terms of Chloe, and to discourse of her marriage.

Much was it that the cow-herd, after his subtle clownish guise, enforced unto
Dryas, whereby the better to make him self seem a man adapted to such a
pursuit, and the rather to incorage Dryas to make him his son in law, besides
the much reputation of his wealth evermore thrust forward, to give unto him also
the greater and more evident demonstration, that he should not marry his
daughter to a beggar or a pinch fist, he tendered unto him for his good will,
many fair and husband-like presents, rich for the state of a cow-heard as he
was, whereof he praid him to make acceptance, and to give his good will to the
marriage. A yoke of fair large oxen would he give for the plough, 4 hiues of
bees, fifty foot square of the best part of his orchard, an ox hide large and
thick for lether, and every year besides a fair and principal hecfar. That
Dryas was covetous Dorcon had good experience, and therefore intruded upon him
so many fair offers: the delicacie and wealth whereof tickled indeed
something exceedinglye the mind of the man, and had it not been, that a
certain doubtful fear ouer-tooke him, of some unlooked for after-clappes,
he had peradventure, by desire of that commodity consented to the determined
purpose.

But considering afterward better of the case, and esteeming by the
likelihoods of those ornaments which with Chloe he had had received, that her
descent was not so mean, as to respect a place of so base a calling, nor a
shape so far more than seemly, resting in her excellent proportion, ought to
be bestowed upon a creature so far out favor, and altogether servile: he
utterly abstained any further to harken to the suit of Dorcon, reckoning fully
with himself, that if ever after it did happen, that she were recognized by
her parents, and that then it should be known, that for covetousness of gain,
he had in so bad and vile manner misprized her, it could not but turn to his
great detriment and irrecuperable undoing, if at the least wise he might upon
the knowledge thereof be infranchized from death: Led therefore as he was, by
the regard of these doubts, he therevppon prayed Dorcon for very neighborhoodes
sake, to pardon him, and excusing in other sort the matter, willed him from
thence-forth that he would sue no further unto him.

This conceited forecast of Dryas, was nothing at al pleasing to Dorcon, who
seeing himself now the second time, with so flat resolution put off, could
almost (what between love and grief of so many good gifts, that he had in
vain bestowed) have become desperate. It vexed the poor soul to the heart, to
see, that his mornings-milk cheeses, his fat calves, and bacon, were thus unto
the chuffe Dryas imparted, and all for nothing: he could have whined outright
for sorrow, and his humors rumbled together with so bad a medley, as made his
senses wring forth diverse tender passions from out his wrinckled countenance.
But yet recomforted quickly (as to such it often happens) of these uncouth
pangs, the subtle clown began by a new devised fraud now to co^pas that which
before he found so difficult, watching for this cause a convenient time to find
Chloe (if it were possible alone) and to this end, bethought himself, that
upon custom each after others they used to drive their flocks at one certain
time of the day togithers to drink, the one of them daily, as it fell out after
the other. Hereof Dorcon took heed, and only expected the day when she
alone should drive them, which being come, the seely cow-heard thinking to
work a great maisterie in the simplicity of these souls, took upon him a
deceit of marvelous finenesse (resspecting, that it was wrought out of so
hammer-head^ed a trunk) and the devise was this. He took the skin of a great
wolse which one of his bulls fighting by chance had killed with his horns,
and spread the same all over his back, and that so ^ly as the fore-feete
thereof, fell justly before him right ever his hands, and the hinder legs
also covered his thighs down unto his heels, the head, as a visard, lay all
over his face, and thus disguised as he was, by likelihoode in the full shape
and proportion of a woolfe, he drew himself right unto the fountain,
whither should come the flocks of Daphnis and Chloe to be watered. The spring
was situate in a valley very intricate and crooked, and all the place round
about for the most part environed with brembles, sharp pricking furzes, and
low declining ginipers, in sort, that if a woolfe in very deed he had been,
he might easily have couched himself thereaboute to have done a spoil,
Dorcon bussed himself in the thickest of these couerts, waiting the hour when
Chloe should come, assuring himself, that by the fearful show of his shape,
he could not choose but amaze her, and in such amaze might easily seize upon
her, and do what he list unto her.

Not long had the woolfe-like cow-heard couched himself, but the shepherdess
(as wonted) came with her dainty flocks, having left her Daphnis behind, busied
in cutting down of the most tender twigs and boughs, for his goats to browze
upon, against they were returned to pasture, the dogs nevertheless, as
accustomed gards unto her yonglings, at that instant accompanieng her. And as
it is a thing unto them natural, to hunt up and down, and range round about
the field, so at the last it befell, that drawing near unto the bush where
this disguised cow-heard lay couching, they perceived him bussing, and deeming
it some beast, began to baie apase: the fiercest of them hereupon began to snap
at the woolfe, and the rest, hardened with this onset, set also upon him. Dorcon
was now in an ecstasy, and not daring to stand upright, for fear and shame of
the disguise by him without effect pretended, the dogs vnweeting of the
fraud, took no more knowledge of him than whilom did the hounds of Acteon upon
their master, disguised as he was in the shape of a Heart, but harrieng fast
upon the cow-heard, one in one place, and an other in an other place, so
rudely rushed upon him, as tearing the woolfes skin from his shoulders, they
made him discover him self at the last to be no more than the poor and simple
cow-heard Dorcon.

By this time the mask grew utterly to be marred, and the sharp percing teeth
of those merciless dogs, pinched so near his buttockes, as Dorcon was feign
to start. Chloe fearful of the event, and dreading the fury of some wild
beast, skreched a maine, whereof Daphnis having regard, sped himself in all
have to her reskue. But Dorcon contrary to expectation, having sustained more
penance than he required, and pestered with the continual biting of the
dogs, could no other ways relieve him self then in discovering what he
was, wherewith incite against his will, he cried vehemently to Daphnis. The
simple youth suspecting as little fraud, as his innocent years ministered unto
him occasion of evil, wondering at the accident, and thinking that it had been
done only but as a jest, wherewith to have frayed them, approached the
Coweherde, and both he and the Shephardesse rating the dogs, and drawing them
thence with their common whistlepipe took poor Dorcon with much pain from
out of the covert, whom scarce being able to stand for the many hurts in
diverse parts about him received, having nothing wherewith to fend him self,
they led between their arms to the fountain, and washed his wounds, which
done, they brought him by the hand unto his way, and recomforting his decayed
spirits by all means possible left him at the last to the peculiar in sight,
and consideration of his own evils, unknowing alas were these to hardy guiles
and enterprises of Love, unto those tender Impes, nor did they at all
participate any part of the frawde to the same incident or belonging, whose
charie regard of well-doing, became the only supporte of their mere
simplicity and good meaning.

Dorcon, now solitarily conceiving of this so strange an alteration, had all
his imaginations thenceforth utterly benommed, for ever thereafter to continue
a lover. And in this hurly burly, the unaccustomed baying also of the dogs,
had so far scattered abroad the flocks and herdes, as both Daphnis him
self and Chloe had much pain, til night to draw them together again, the
one part whereof being climed to the hiest rocks and mountain tops that
might be, and the other fearfully straggled in diverse parts down toward
the sea coasts. And albeit, their joint herdes were otherwise so well ordered
and taught by their guides, as that with the least clap of hands, whistle, or
other sound of voice that might be, they would draw to their companies, yet
now were they so far frighted with this uncouth noise, as that with all the
travel to them used, they could scarce be wholly brought together again to
accompany. But night, that brings in conclusion every labor to eude, had
at the last conducted also these heardes into their several fo^^es. And
werisomnes of the painful travel sustained, served them as a medicine to
bring into the thoughts of these passionate derlings the accustomed rest, from
whence a good while since they had been bereued. Sleep made them to forget
their loves, and the feruencie of their passion swaied thereby a great deal
less in the disturbance of those their mutual affectes. But the bright
shining day, which is the discouerer and common renewer of every crased
fantasy, put her and him in mind again, of their wonted misease. The ruddie
rays brandishing the Eastern skies, revealed a new the fresh and quick
spreading flames of their late receued passions, the enteruewe of each breding
on the first sight, a novel grief, issuing interchauncheablie from him to her,
and her to him, not for that they saw each other, in either of whom the
contemplation was a mithridate to a pestered conceipted mind, but y^ the deep
percing in sight thereby sustened conceived in each view so wonderful and
strange an effect, as in conclusion converted the former physic it
received, to a most increasing and almost irrecuperable malady,

Infinite were their desires (for to covet, is to mankind natural) but what
it was they desired, or wherein consisted the determinate conclusion of the
same, that by their simplicity, could no ways be defined. If they coueted to
see each other they saw, if to play togethers, they played, if to speak, they
spoke, if mutuallye to embrace, they embraced, and hereof there was unto them
at all no kind of controlment, At their liberty they enjoyed what they
listed, and having all that they would, they could not yet, conceive therein
the principal part, of that they most desired. Contentment reposed it self
upon their deepest disquiet, and from their greatest miscontentment sprang
up again their chiefest ease. Now was it in the decreasing time of the
spring, and freshest Summer perking in her gayest pride, made way to her
entrance, the flowrishing growth of every living thing, wared proud of their
being. Now bloss^nted were the fruits on trees, and Ceres in her tillage,
and Pomona in her orchardes, brethed in the fresshest air their sweetest
savors, Titan having wound him self in the Crabbe, drew fast to the Lions
cabin, whereby the season growing hoote, it seemed the Rivers and grauellie
springes, placed in most cool and temperate shades, invited each youthful
gallant, to their sweet pleasing baynes: Whereunto Zephyrus gently busling
through the twigges of the lofty Pines his comfortable blastes, appeared by
the pleasant murmr thereof to make a kind of Music, by means of which
trilled sometimes down before them the sweet smelling appels from the highest
branches.

Phoebus sporting him self to glaunce through the thickest grooues upon their
naked shapes, made Daphnis (enflamed both by an inward love and heat of the
present season) to visice the springs, where casting him self into a delicate
River, one while would he chase the Swannes alofte, and an other while cast
himself to the bottom, catching therewithal at the smoothe gliding fishes.
Often would he gulpe into his entrayles a great quantity of the cool water,
and then swim again washing and turning himself in the stream desirous to
see if there-withall the hot parching heat he sustemed, might any ways
be cooled: but all invaine, for that the force thereof, by afar more
vehement fury, was inwardlye supported.

Chloe having by this time drawn forth her sheep and goats to be milked,
remained so much the Ienger thereaboutes, for that the sharp singing flies
buzzing round about her unstained visage had in the drawing down of the
son something busily vexed her, whereupon having washed her face in one of
the nearest fountains, she gathered of all sorts of flowers, and them
wreathed, in the branches and tenderest twigs of the Pine-trees, whereof
she made a chapelet, and therewith crowned her amber colored tresses, and
having girded her self in the skin of a mighty heart, buckled fast on her
even pressed sholders, she filled one pot of wine and another of milk, and
therewith came to entertain her deerlie favored Daphnis. Who fastening his
earnest looks on her admirable bewties made way to issue from the river, and
she stroking again his delicate limbs with f^esh prepared clothes, finding
nothing therein to be reprehended, (so rightly proporcioned was he in all
fewtures) with many sweet embratings clothed she him apace in his shepherds
garments. In all this demeanor were not the conceits of Daphnis, in
beholding her graces altogether unoccupied, who seeing her compassed in such
nymphlike attire, supposed one while that she was as the fair Laeda, who for
her exceading shape, deserved solie to become the mother of the most beautiful
Helena, an otherwhile him seemed that she was some Io, only meece to be
reserved to none other but for the mighty Jupiter, sometimes he likened her
to one of the Nymphs in the Cave. whose looks as he thought, carried of her
behavior a most notable resemblaunce, and holding her pot in her hands of
wine and milk toward him, he was wholly confused by Love the force whereof
distilling amain within him, had wrought to his most secret entrails.
Smilingly therefore taking the Chapelet from her head, and with great devotion
kissing it, he put it on his own, and taking in hand an harp, whereon his
softened strokes were varied with most excellent conning, he tuned the same
forthwith, and song thereunto in her praises this dittie following.

Sweet sweetened be the hours, the days, the months and times,
Wherein with sweet conceits my soul, thy sweetened favor climes
Sweet be thy looks, thy touch, thy speech, thy gate and all
Ten thousand sweets betide thee still, whose sweetness stains them all.
Ye flowers whose motlie hues do pranke in Natures pride.
Do shroud your selves, and for my sweet, your beauties lay aside.
Ye temprate western winds, whose air yields sweetened breath
Deny your sweet to be as hers, whose sweet yields life or death
Ye deintie tuned fowls whose notes do deck the spring
Confess in hearing of her soundes, your sweets small pleasure bring
Ye crystal sacred springs, ye vales and mountains hie,
Whose pleasant walks her passage decks, and spreading favors die
Agree with me in this, my sweet (surpassing far)
Excels the sweetness of you all, and does your pleasures bar.
His song concluded in the delicacie of this so great a commen^acion, Chloe
took no small pleasure, in seeing her self thus highly to be magnified in
the liking of him, whom above al other she most entierly favored, wherefore
enclining her looks to his sweet distilling favors, one while conceived she
great pleasure in parting of his locks, brown in color as the Myrtle berries,
resembling therein the comlie shape of Adonis, Iulled sometimes in the lap of
Venus, and denoting in particular terms the some of al his perfections, with
many sugared speches she began to admire him, which kindling in Daphnis an
earnest zeal in contemplacion of all her favors, made him in farther
demonstration of the great felicity he thereby conceived, to add unto his
former praises also, these succeding verses.

Those hears the golden wiers of my well tuned sound,
Become the pleasure of my panges, and make my joys abound.
These seemly eyes the glass, whereof my fewture stays,
And forehead large, the field on which, depends my blisfull rays.
This mouth the deintie spring that yeldes me cause of life,
These teeth the pearls of precious price, that cure mine inward grife.
These lips the curroll fresh, that comforts heart and mind,
These looks the guarders of my love, by whom I favor find.
Those cheeks the apples fresh, whereon Vermilion taint,
Be mixed with the silver white, my sugared pleasure paint.
These pits in dented cheeks, are chaires for Beauty plaste,
Wherein, triumphant favor sits, impugning woes to waste.
This neck of yu'ry white, confounder of my cares,
These hands the aids to further that, which love for me prepares.
These feet the wished steps, whereout my ioies arise
From these and out of these ensue, what else I may devise.
Thus decked in my joys, on her I gaze my fill
Whose shape has power to comfort all, but never force to spill
Herewith Daphnis having taken his flute sounded thereupon diverse excellent
ditties. And for so much as it grew toward the midst of the day, the
melodiousnesse of the sound together with the heat of the season, brought
Chloe a sleep, their flocks by this time being couched all together under
the shadie tops which Daphnis perceiving, stayed quickly his music and
withdrawing his flute, gave him self thereupon to gaze at full upon her most
exquisite perfections. And seeing that there was none about him to countermaund
his demeanors, he began secretly thus to deliver in him self. Oh how
sweetly these eye liddes of my fair and blissful Chloe are couched
together, how delicate is the sent and savor of her breath, the sweetness
whereof neither these albpine buddes, nor flowers them selves, do in any sort
imitate, yet dare I not for this, to kiss at all, these sweet savors for
that the very touch is more peercing than the swords point, and the force
thereof cutteth the very heart on sonder, and as the receipt of the new made
honey, so swells in those that touch it the harmefull poison thereof:
Neither would I yet enforce that injury to my Chloe, as by to rude pressing
her lips, to yield disturbance to her quiet. Alas these grasshoppers I fear
me with their piping tunes, will wake my deerling. Ye cruel beasts, why hurt
ye so rudely with your horns, impatient as it seems to give unto my derling
any rest. O ye wolfes, at this instant more crauinlike then the foxes them
selves, why rush ye not into these heardes to scatter them on sonder? Whylest
Daphnis continued in these and such like complaints, a seely greshopper
egerly pursued by a swallowe, cast her self by chance, for her sauegarde into
the bosom of Chloe, by means whereof, the Swallowe neither was able to catch
her, nor longer could use unto her the force of her wing, notwithstanding, the
bird came so near that with fluttering up and down about her face, she
awakened Chloe out of her sleep, the fear whereof, made the Nymphe, (for that
she knew not what it was) to skritche alowde, but when she saw the Swallowe
yet fluttering top and fro about her, and Daphnis laughing by her at the
harmless fear and sport thereof, she deemed the less of the matter, and
rubbing her eyes, yet greedy of sleep, she made her self ready to arise.

The grasshopper was yet between her breasts, and as on e delivered as it
seemed from danger, and in the kind it bare, willing to show it self
thankful, began to chante where she sat, remunerating thereby the good
turn at her hands received, by reason of which, Chloe not yet experienced of
the accident, cried outright, and Daphnis again laughed a pace at the sport,
and loathing to grieve her overmuch, conveyed thereupon his hand between her
breasts, and took out the grassehopper, which yet thankful of her sauegarde
continued chaunting between his hands, whereupon the fair Shepherds knowing
what it was, took it again and returned it forthwith into her bosom. Shortly
hereupon it befell that a certain Ringdoue sitting in a grove hard by, began
to sing, in whose song Chloe taking great delight, demanded of Daphnis the
reason thereof, whereupon the gentle Goatheard desirous of her utmost
satisfaction, began to recompe unto her, this story following.

There was (my dear) said he, in times passed, a young damsel fair of
shape, and in the prime of her age, bewtifull as your self, who keeping her
cattle upon these pastures, had right excellent skill, both to sing and play
delicately. Her beasts had pleasure in her tunes, and so delightful was the
sound of her voice and pipe, that she governed them at pleasure, and was able
to draw them whether she would.

This beautiful Nymphe sitting under a stately Pine, having her head crowned
with the leaves thereof, one day happened to sing a song in the honor of Pan,
wherewith her beasts began so earnestly to be inclined, as that they drew
them close to her soundes. Near unto her was there likewise keeping of Cattle
a certain young youth, fresh and froolicke as her self, who right well
handled his pipe, and could thereon play many deintie ditties. One day
amongst the rest, with intent to show that his coming was not bad, he took
his pipe in hand, and thereon in disdain of the Nymphe, placed so sweetly
and melodiously, as that with the ouerpleasing sound thereof, he drew from
her eight of her fairest beasts, pursuing the sweetness of his Pipe, do what
she could, and made them to join to his company, wherewith the poor wenche
vexed for grief and intolerable dispite, to see her flocks so much to be
diminished, and chiefly also, that she was thus overcome in her own cunning,
took so great a grief of the same, as that she prayed the gods, and they
vouchsafed to change her into a foul, rather than any more with such infamy
to return to her dwelling. This performed, and she, as you see, being made a
bird of the mountain, in accustomed sort, follows up and down, plaining her
ill hap and loss of her beasts, whom she seeks, being thus as she was
unluckily overcome, and singing as she was wont to do, reteineth yet some
part of her ancient tunes and sorrowful complainings.

In these, and such like devises, spent they the disportes of the pleasant
Summer, till Autumn drawing on, the vintage began to approach, for that the
grapes grew fully to be ripened, in which time certain rouers of Tire, having
a Foist rigged and manned lately from Carye, happened to come ala^d upon the
Island, and roming up and down here and there upon the country, they
pilled and spoiled all places where they came, and armed as they were, ran
into every corner to take what they could get, whereby, as chance happened, they
took great store of wines, grain, and honey, the novelty whereof was such, as
it was yet in the wax, and therewithal robbed and spoiled the seely Dorcon
of all his beasts and cattle, leaving the man sore wounded, and wel-nigh dead
with their blows. And cou^sing as they were up and down in the Island, Daphnis
by ill hap walking on the sea-banke, was by them surprised, for yet was not
Chloe gone forth with her sheep, being early days, and fearing (for she was
alone) to be enforced, by some other of the rudest sort of the sheepheards. The
rouers seeing this young youth, fair, seemly and strong, and thinking him of
better regard than any part else of their prize, they made no further pursuit
after his goats, but contenting themselves with his person, and that they had
besides, they returned again to their Foist: Daphnis cryeng out upon Chloe,
the remembrance of whom in this extremity did only consume him.

These thieves being scarce got aboard, and not yet making way with their oars
into the stream, Chloe by this time was come unto the pastures with her
sheep, and failing of Daphnis in the place of their accustomed meetings,
seeing therewithal his goats and tender kiddes all scattered and disordered,
here and there, she began to fear the woorst. At last, hearing his voice, yet
crieng and complaining after her (for yet was he within sound) she left her
sheep, and throwing down her* Pipe, has^ned with all speed possible to
Dorcon, in mind to require his aid, whom between life and death she found
groueling upon the ground, half slain of the thieves, and scarce able for
faintnes to deliver his mind unto her, having lost of his blood an exceeding
quantity. The cow-heard yet perceuing Chloe to be there, the remembrance of
his ancient love, kindled in his mind some n^uell forces, whereby enforcing
himself a little, he thus said unto her: My dear Chloe, thou come even
now unto me at the rendering of my ghost, for long I know I cannot live, so
many ways have these cruel rouers wounded me, and beat me down as an ox in
the s^all: nevertheless, if thou will, it is yet in thy power to save Daphnis,
and to be revenged on the wicked creatures for my death. I have (Chloe)
hitherto accustomed my beasts to the sound of my pipe, and that in so certain
and assured manner, as in the hearing thereof, be they never so far from me,
they will yet by all means possible draw homewards again: take here my Flute
quickly, and hasting to the seacoast, sound unto the beasts my tune, that
often before this thou have heard me teach unto Daphnis, and wherein thy self
I know, art reasonably well instructed by him, at the hearing whereof, my
beasts I dare assure thee will shift to come back, and Daphnis thereby may be
saved. My Flute I freely give unto thee for thy travel, whereon heretofore I
have gained the prize among all the heardsmen, only for recompense I require
at thy hands but once to kiss me, whilst yet I am now dieng, and that my
soul shall forthwith depart the body, and when I am gone, bewail my death,
and yet think upon Dorcon at the least wise when hereafter thou shall behold
any others a keeping of their cattle, who once above all others so entirely
loved thee.

Having delivered unto her these speeches, the kiss he received of Chloe, and
his life ended at one instant together. Whereupon she took his pipe, and
forthwith set it to her mouth, on which the blasts she blewe were so shrill,
that the beasts having knowledge thereof, and the tune thereby delivered, they
altogether with one amase, bussed out of the Foist, and jointly with one poise
rushed into the sea, which being but on the one side alone of the ship, the
force and weight of the multitude was so great, that therewith they quite
ouerturned the vessels, and whelmed men and all therein into the sea^, but not
with one and the selfsame hope of safety: for that the thieves being
clogged with their harness, swords, and other defensive weapons, were not
able by the weight thereof long to help themselves, but Daphnis being light as
the Summer season required, unshod and naked in the upper parts, easily came to
land, supported by the horns of two of these oxen jointly, between whom,
having cast himself, he was easily carried to land, for these kind of beasts
by common opinion having longer force of swimming than any other creatures
whatsoever, except only the fishes and water-foules, the proofs whereof have
been made by diverse. In this force, as you have heard, escaped the poor
Daphnis in dangerous adventures at one instant togithers, the one in becoming
a perpetual bondslaue to the thieves, the other after escape of that hazard,
in being delivered from drowning.

In being come forth of the sea, he found Chloe upon the shore between her
former distilled tears, and present reioicing of his safe arrival,
entertaining him at one instant togethers* whereupon, casting himself between
her arms, he desired to understand of her the cause of her playing at that
instant on the Flute. Chloe, upon such demand recounted unto him the whole
progression of speech between her and Dorcon, the use of his beasts to that
sound, the robbery, spoil, and wounds by him received, finally, his death,
and before his dying, how he committed to her usage the custody of his pipe,
only of modesty abstained she to tell of her kissing him, as a matter over
and besides the chance of that his present delivery. But Daphnis recreated of
his heavy labors, forgot not for to honor the memory thereof in the person
of Dorcon for a perpetual remembrance, and therefore together with his
parents and friends celebrated accordingly his unhappy funeralles, as by the
death of whom grew the occasion of his unlooked for escape out of so manifest
perilles. His body therefore being closed in the ground, Daphnis with other
sheepeheards round about his grave, planted sundry trees, and each one hun^
upon the boughs some part of his cunning maistries, they cast also thereupon
hallowed grapes, and milk, and for that he was cunning upon the Flute, they
fixed over his grave sundry sorts of pipes. His beasts being come ashore,
piteously belowed, and cried after him, which some heardsemen interpreted to be
a sorrowful lamentation, for the want of their guide and master.

When Dorcon was thus enterred, Chloe took here Daphnis, and led him to the
cave of the Nymphs, where she cleansed and washed his body, neat, and pure of
it self, as the whitest alablaster, afterward gathering together sundry
sorts of flowers, as the pleasant season of the year then freshly served,
they made chapele^s for the images, and over the mouth of the cave amongst the
other instruments, tendered unto the Nymphs the Flute of Dorcon, as an
offering, which being finished, they returned both again to their flocks,
whom they found all sorrowfully couched togethers on the tender grass,
abstaining (as it seemed) from their food, for the loss of those who were
w^ont to govern them, whom they deemed to be utterly perished. But having
again the sight of their beloved guides, they fell afresh to their pastures,
the sound of whose voices and melodious piping, made them for to taste the
better their accustomed feeding.

The goats couched before in the lowest bushes, began now to peke to the
hills, the kiddes skipped for joy, the sheep and tender lambs amazed no more,
but universally reioiced at their presence. Sitting therefore down on the
hillockes, whilst Chloe wearied with ernest labor, and moiled with travel for
the search of her Daphnis, gave hirselfe to the fountain, wherein to bathe and
wash her ^ender limbs: the parts discovered unto the young goatheard, carrieng
in themselves the pureness of her complexion, renewed afresh in his
imaginations the thoghts of his love. Now began he again to pant and breath, as
if newly he were to be enforced for a pray to the thieves, now languished he in
like sort by his secret imaginations, and so much also inwardly swelled, as it
had been one that had drunk poison, his pulces furiously bet by a disordered
heat, as if yet his spirits had been chased, he lived and longed, and looking
was never satisfied of that, which always he most desired. The crystal
waters contained only in one slender spring, in which the Nymphe washed
herself, became unto his sight, more fearful than the very depest seas. Him
seemed thereupon, his life as yet stood in hazard, at the hands of the most
merciles rouers. And thus continuing in these variable fits, lived pore D^phnis
sequestered from the due accomp^ and benefit of all his passed pleasures, like
unto such a one as him self, who being always nourished in the fields,
knew not how to make decernement of Love or any part of his subtilties. But
she whose gracious looks were replenished with all kind of favor toward
him, perceiving the melancholy Muse whereunto he was driven, now fresh as the
cristall dewes had made her, and much like unto one of these daughters of the
Springs, or Neptunes derling, the fair Venus her self issuing out of one of
her fathers rivers, in such manner approached she his presence, wherefore for y^
she was the soueraign guide and director of all his thoughts, she quickly could
find the delay wherewith his continual coursing fancies were presently to be
mitigated. Whereupon joining her self side to side unto him, each greting the
other with many loving imbracements they enterchangeable framed their tunes one
to the other, concluding that days traueill with this sonet following,

Daphnis. Ye brightest gleames within those percing eyes
Whose glimpse retains a show of power divine
Enclose your selves, for fear from lofty skies
Some envious star do at your glory pine.

Chloe Ye mighty powers, to whom these sacred groves
Right pleasing been. And Nymphs that haunt this shade,
Envy you not with wreake the hardye proves
That Natures self in Daphnis shape has made

Daphnis Alas if Phoebus should the heat for-thinke
That once for love in burning breast he bare
And mazed at thy fewter, gin to shrincke
From her to thee, then woe be^ide my share.

Chloe Alas if Venus stealing to her springs
In mind her sweet Adonis to embrace
Thy curled locks should view whose beauty stings
And thee for him admire, then woe my case.

Daphnis Excelling jewels, bear the choicest price
Things less in show, envy always the best:
Less Phoebe shines, when Tytan ginnes to rise
Where mighty force effects, there shrowds the least.

Chloe Unmatched pearls, have value still for show
When best exceeds, who can deny the place
Though things be rated hie, yet this we know
It (needs) excels, whose weight has highest grace,

Daphnis Be honored then, thou Nimphe of all the flocks


Chloe Be fairest thou of all that guide their b^ard


Daphnis Let still thy name resound on hiest rocks


Chloe And Chloe never be of thy change afeard.


The second book of the loves pastoral of Daphnis and Chloe.
BY this time had the harvest season ripned and carried in all the corn, and
the vintage began a pace to be brought in hand, Bacchus feasted in his glory
sat environed with the vines and the Bacchanals of the youthful god were now
to be cellebrated. The people of Mitelene each where prepared their vessels
fit and meet for this season, some beginning to have in a readiness their
presses, others to wash their tons, some to make pots and panniers wherein to
convey the grapes, others to sharp their hooks, sheares and knives wherewith
to cut down the stalks, this man prepared pestles to bruise the grapes, they
again scaled hemp to be beaten wherewith to make cresset-light to continue
burning for them, when the wine waxed ready for tunning. Daphnis and Chloe
were not idle in these companies, who putting themselves also forwards to the
common labor, were of all sorts of the people generally each where liked and
commended. He for his part, carried the grapes in the panyers, and trod them
in the troughes, afterward also tunned the new wines, and gave him self
with travel unto every exercise. She likewise tricking her self neatlie,
made sondrie things ready for the workmen, dressed their meats, and prepared
for them wines of the old year passed, and mingled with milk, and when she
had so done, then would she return again to the vines, and from the
branches that she might easelie attain unto, cut down the grapes, for the
vines of Uignenoble in Mitelene, do all for the most part grow ^lowe, or at
the leastwise never to h^e, or spreading to much on the trees, whereon the
bonches pendaunt also are commonly so weighty and great, and spreading
themselves therewith into such length and breadth, as that a child of four
or five years old, may almost reach unto them.

And as the custom is in these Bacchanales, when the grapes are in this sort
gathered in, they call from all places of their villages, their neighbors, as
well men as women togethers to help in the vintage. According wher-vnto they
being there assembled a wonder was it to see the womanish demeanors of the most
part of those gossips, what censures each of them gave of y^ young shepeheard
Daphnis. They seemed each of them to be enamored on all his particularities,
some of them having in choicest reconing his talk and seemly stature, some
his youthful countenances, not yet fully grown unto manly tipenes, others
his abourne locks curled naturally in the forepartes and sides, and
artificially ^emed and tressed behind, on his shoulders, this again had in
estimat his fair and goodly forehead, eyes, and other seemlie propor^ioned
fewturs not to be despised, she looked on his legs straight and hie calued,
that commended his amiable favors, being such as wherewith the Nymphs them
selves might not disdain to be acquinted. With those, his ac^iuitie was
greatly praised, and by them again his skill in Music principally extolled.

One amongst the rest impatient, as appeared of her fervent affection, running
upon a sudden to the bashful Shepherd, kissed ere he was aware his delicate
lips, wherewith as one that had been pricked or stong with a waspe, the
blushing youth angry in his mind at the wrong to him tendered in his Chloes
presence, rubbed and roused his lips, as if thereby he had sus^eined some
notable blemishe.

Now as the women fed thus their gasing eyes upon Daphnis, so likewise the
men on the other side upon the surpassing demeanours of Chloe grew greatly
to be amazed. Her gestures to them appeared of so notable excellency, as with
the like whereof their gross conceiptes had seldom before been invred. The
unaccustomed gasing of whom had cast in her seemelievisage, a vermillion more
perfect, than rested in the fresh springing rose, wherewith the very color
of the fine and fresh garden lilly being conferred, a mixture so exquisite
and deintie thereout arose, as that it seemed the purest and lively counterset
of a sweet favored beauty, that might be, had taken harbor in her
countenance. They daunced oftentimes, and skipped about her, as whilom did the
Satyrs in their madding pastimes, full oftentimes wished they themselves to
have become as the sheep and tender lambs, the rather to be resiant in the
company of so seemly a sheepeheardesse, and often to be dallied with and
touched in her delicate hands. The inducements whereof, grew unto the seclie
Chloe, so tedious, as before the several vsages of the others had been unto
Daphnis. Often wished they iointlye, that these vintages were once passed, and
that their liberty (sequestered from those unused societies) might return to
the^ again in haunting the valle is, as they were to-fore time accustomed, and
that in stead of these fawning praises, they might once hear again their
mellodious Flutes in the fields amongst their flocks freshly to be sounded.

After a few days now passed, and the vintage something spent, their wishes
there with began also to take effect, by mean^ whereof Chloe in woonted guise
led earelie in the morning her sheep to the pastures: Daphnis also settled
amongst his herds, as one that had a long time been estranged from his
delights, began with pleasure to haunt the downs, and sometimes with his goats
to clime the steepest rocks. It was a world of liking unto him, to join his
pipe and tunes to her notes, sometimes also played she sweetly upon his Flute,
whereunto, one while with his voice, an other while with his music would
Daphnis answer again artificially. Then doing their woonted obseruances to
the Nymphs, they visited their caves, groves, and pleasant fountains, and on
their statues hung they many bunches of their fairest grapes: Chloe renewed
again their heads and tresses, with fresh herbs and flowers, and dallieng
afterward togethers, as being returned to the place and resiaunce of all
their happiness, they entered into their woonted sheepeheardes pastimes.

Now as they were thus playieng, and spending the time togithers, there happened
into their company on a sudden, an ancient heardsman, his head and beard
snowish white for age, but yet not altogether spent in years, who being
clothed in the fashion of the oldest sheepeheards, saluted these darlings, and
presented the^ with sundry fruits which he had brought thither in his budget.
And resting himself upon the soft turfe hard by their sides, began to enter
with them into diverse discourses. The young sheepeheard and his Nymph had
pleasure to hear him, and with great attention gave heed to all the speeches,
that by his auncitient experience were delivered, which he perceiving, the
good old man continued with great good will, and having ended the same, and they
both woondring still what he was, he entered at the last with them into these
terms following.

I am, my son (said he) the aged Philetas, which heretofore have honored
these Nymphs, and haunts, with diverse and sundry ditties, and yet record I my
Flute at this day, nothing worn from the ancient melody, in the honor of the
mighty Pan. Many stately heardes heretofore have I guided, and only by the
sound of my Pipe, to all things constrained, and to this end came I now unto
you, to tell you what I have seen, and what on your behalf, has by the
mighty sovereign of Love been delivered unto me. There is no hill nor grove
heereabouts that has been unknown unto me, no valley that I have not
haunted, nor spring or fountain, but I have tasted, full often in my youth have
I reposed these decayed limbs upon the sweetest grass, and with pleasure
have I soong upon these hillockes our sheepeheards merry lays and pastimes.

And now understand ye, that I have heere-by a very fair nurserye, which by
mine own handie exercise I have sowed, planted, labored, and trimmed, with
all kind of delicacies, even sit hence the very time that (constrained by
creeping age) I have abstained any more to feed and watch my beasts, upon these
goodly plains. Within my nurserie, there is nothing, that for the season of
the year may be desired, but I have it there sea^ed. For the spring time, I
have roses, violets, flouredelis, herbs, and other devises of sundry sorts:
for the summer, pears, apples, cherries, plummes, berries, and fruits of all
kind of pleasure. Now for this sea^on of autumn have I also, grapes, figs,
nuts, orenges, pomegranats, mirtles, and twenty other like pleasures. To this
nurcerie by reason of the situation and delicacie, have customably always
resorted diverse sorts of birds, of the brauest kinds, flocking in troops,
both to feed and solace themselves, chanting on the branches and hedge-rowes
thereabout, their harmonious soundes, wherein the couer^ being very spacious
and wide, by reason of the great number of trees, every where growing gives
unto them the more scope and pleasure a great deal, whereby at will they might
recreat them selves all togethers.

In three sundry places of this plotte, arises three principal fountains,
issuing from the most sweetest and wholesome springs* watering with their
ouer-flowing tops, all over the gardens. The ground being so wide, and the
tr^es so thick, make the place seem a far off as if it were a wood.
Whilst warily I have day by day attended my fruits, and with great pleasure
hearkened after the sound of these gentle birds, behold, for a great space
together each day about noone, I have perceived tripping in the shade, under my
myrtle trees, and pomegranats, a fair young boy, holding in each hand
pomegranats and mirts. His shape white as the color of milk, an other time
red as the glowing fire, his skin pure, neat, and clean, as if even now he
were come forth of some pleasant river, naked is he always in show, and ever
alone, and without company: him seems to have great felicity, in gathering
my flowers, my fruits, and my berries, and that does he so freely and so
careless of check or controlment, as if the plot were his own, and not
belonging at all to anyeother but himself, which having often perceived, I
endeavored many times to run unto him, fearing least in his tripping and
skipping up and down, he might happen to break my myrtle twigs or pomegranat
branches, but not for this could I ever so much as once reach near unto him,
so nimble is he in his flight, and therewithal so swift, and being so
escaped, then cools he himself covertly, shrowding under the rosters, and
sometimes under the broad spreading poppies, no otherwise than if it were some
preatie flieng partridge.

Many times have I coursed after the young sucking kiddes, and often followed
after my tender calves, but this than those, seems a far more contrary
pastance, for do what I could, I might never attain unto him, no, when
sometimes he has almost seemed to be under my hands. Wherefore, seeing that
no pursuit auailed, and considering, that by reason of mine age I became
weary, and fainted, I lea^ed once on my s^affe, watching always his goings,
that still I might keep him in sight, and the tripping lad, drawing something
near me, I began to reason with him after my manner, and demanded thereupon,
what neighborhood he had unto us, and upon what occasion he took upon him
in such manner to enter my nurserie and garden, and without leave or other
demand, in sort as he did to gather my flowers and fruits, whereunto he
answered me nothing, but approaching something more near unto me, he sweetly
began for to smile, and daintily seemed for to sport at me, casting with
his delicate hands, the myrtle berries on my face and breast. What operation
the same might by nature have received I know not, but with the soft touching
blows, I felt my senses and mind immediately toward him to be mollified,
neither could I afterward for my life, so much as seem angry.

Being thus calmed of all mine eager pursuit against him, I converted thereupon
my color to entreaty, gently praying that upon assurance, and without any
fear or doubt at all he would come unto me, swearing by my Mirts and all my
pleasant fruits and nurseries, that with as much good will as might be, I would
let him go again, and besides of my myrtle berries, and fairest pomgranats
would give unto him also the best choice and plenty, and suffer him at all
times after when he listed, to gather both flowers and fruits at his
pleasure, only that for all these courtesses and offers, he would permit me at
his dainty cheeks to have but one sole kiss* Here-vppon the gentle lad
began to laugh right heartily and apase, and with a gay and pleasant cheer,
filled with all kind of delight that might be, he tendered unto my hearing a
found so sweet, amiable, and well pleasing, as there is no nightingale,
thrush, or other kind of bird whatsoever, that haunteth either won^s or
hedge-rowes, that ever gave forth the like, or carried in her tunes, so
delightful a melody, and in the delivery thereof thus he said unto me.

It can not, nor shall ( Philetas) be unto me a pain to kiss thee* for that
of mine own instinct, and proper condition, the ami^ble custom thereof, is
given to delight me, and more esti^ and pleasure have I therein, then there is
desire in thee to recover thy youth and wonted passed sportes, wherein thou
have been conversant, again. But take heed that what herein thou demaundest
of me, return not in the end to thine own hurt and damage, as a thing
altogether unfit and disagreing to thy present age. For that I can assure thee,
that notwithstanding thine ancient estate, wherein thou think thy self to
be utterly freed* if but in the least sort that might be my lips should touch
thee, thou should yet as ho^elie broile in desire, and covet to fellow me,
as any others. Now is my flight so great, as there is neither Egle, Falcon,
nor other foul whatsoever, be their wings never so swifte, that can overtake
me.

I am not as thou deemest, a child, albeit in my shape there is at all no
other appearance, but for my of spring am more ancient then old Saturn, or
any auncientrie it self. When thou Philetas wast here a young man, and in the
flower and prime of thy youth and iolicie, when thou feddest thy heardes in
these marshes, then and long before that, did I know thee. Thy playing here
on these hillockes and plains, whereon thou often soundest unto the hills and
rocks thy wonted tunes, are not to me unknown. Neither thy fa^re Amarillis
on whose youthful beawties, thy amors waxed then so fervent, and
notwithstanding nor she, nor thou could ever perceive me, yet was I still in
the midst of your loves, near, and evermore here and there about you. By me
Philetas thou enioycost her as thine own, by means whereof thou have obtained
many children, who as thy self are at this instant grown up to be good
heardsmen and laborers. So now have I also in like charge two impes of the
same kind, sacred from their infancy to the Nymphs, and honoring in their
shepherd habits, both the pastures and downs, Daphnis and Chloe, derlings unto
bewties self, and unto whose affections both Pan and Satires become charie.
Having this morning brought them together unto the downs, I entered immediately
for my dispore into thy nourserte, cussing as thou see, thy fruits flowers
and trees, which thou by thy fruitful labor have there planted, and washing
my shape in thy fountains, do solace my self round about the same, which is
the cause Philetas, why all thy plants and herbs do grow with so great
success, and are in their prime so fair and seemly to show, for that by the
self same spring wherein my loving limbs are bathed, thy flowers and plants
be watered.

For proof of this, behold thy trees, and al thy nourserie over, round about,
and see if by reason of my passage, sport or daliance there-on, any one jot be
broken or perished, the fruits any thing spoiled, or either stalk or herb,
so much as by any of my steps foiled, or thy fountains troubled, and then
repute thereby thine own happiness, who only among all others of thine age,
have the daily success and fruition of my wished companies. He had no sooner
delivered unto me these speeches, but fluttering forthwith over my Mirtes, no
otherwise then if it had bin some pretty pleasant redbrest, he p^rched from twig
to twig* through and besides the green leaves, and in the end mounting to the
very top of the tree, I there perceived his bow, his arrows, his quiver,
and wings at his back, in the beholding and admiring whereof, he suddenly
vanished away, and I beheld him no more. If now my white hears and aged
experience, may give testimony of any accident, or that my judgment thereby
may be a^aileable in ought, then dare I assure unto you both, that you be
chairie unto Love, and that the respects and special disposition of your
actions are wholly devoted unto his godhead. Daphnis and Chloe giving heed to
this sage conclusion of the ancient Philetas, conceived as great felicity
therein, as if he had reported unto them a matter importing a mighty kingdom,
upon which occasion, they began earnestly to demand of him, what manner of
thing it might be, that so was termed and called by the name of Love, if it
were an infant, a bird, or what other thing else that might be conceived, and
what was the power and force, and in what manner is swaied. Whereupon old
Philetas answered them again. Love, said he, is a God, young, fair, and
beautiful to behold, fethered also with wings, by reason whereof his
appearance is soden, and takes pleasure to be conversant with young folks, he
searches favors, and makes the hearts of men to fly as it were with wings,
his power is mightier then that of Jupiter, he rules over the Elements and
stars, and over those also who are gods as him self. Your selves have not so
great sovereignty over your flocks, as he has power over the world. The
flowers herbs and trees, are the labors of Love, by him the waters cool, and
the winds do blow. I have seen in the very beasts and birds also his
power to have greatly swaied. I my self sometimes being young, loved the
fair and fresh Amarillis, in which time of the continuance and feruencie of
mine affection, my feeding and appetite was taken away, I cared neither to
drink nor eaten, nor was capeable of any ease or quiet, melancholy and sadness
ministered my pleasure, my heart panted in the daily imagination of her whom I
loved, sometimes seemed I to be in a trance, an other time as one that were
beaten or tormented in his joints. Uerie flames as I thought, were kindled
within me, for the stanching whereof, I often cast my self into the rivers, and
called oftentimes the mighty Pan to releue me, as he that once had been
amourous himself of the fair Pithys, and therefore was not unexperienced of
such lovely passions. I often thanked the Nymphe Echo, in that being in the
woods, she sondrie times would repeat, the name of sweet Amarillis after me.
In so much as perceiving my self many ways to be perplexed, I never could
find any remedy whereby to lessen the vehement and ardent flames that
fretted within me, save only the last and final conclusion of all manner of
affection, which was the sole and only link whereby enchained each to other,
my long beloved Amarillis did at the last embrace me. In the enjoying whereof I
found that kisses gave ease to sighs, liking to longing, and bedding each
with other after marriage concluded, the some of all out determined affection.

Philetas having thus debated with these seely lovers, leuing (by description
of himself) within them, a plain and evident discovery of their own known
dispositions, and continued griefs, departed at the last unto his dwelling.
Upon all which speeches, Daphnis for his part was not unmindful, but finding
in him self, a perfect pattern of all that by Philetas was before discoursed
upon, he found himself now in greater distress then before, for that Love
had long since already begone to touch him to the quick, wherefore seeing by
all similitudes of comparing him self with the discourse uttered by Philetas
between him and his Amarillis, that the passion be sustained, was only by
Love, and that to the quenching and satisfaction thereof belonged, that each of
them might freely and soly enjoy each other, he began now to study by all
means possible how and in what sort he might best endeavor to compass the
same. And hearing that Love was a God, and remembering there-withall that the
like of the same shape and proportion which Philetas had to them described,
appeared to their parents in a vision, at such time as by express direction
both he and Chloe were committed to their cattle keeping, he began in mind,
with humble obseruaunce to reverence him. But for as much as the extremities
reported by Philetas to be continued in his love, had bred in Daphnis more
perseverance then the event also therein delivered, could by any contecture of
his own, succeed to good and present end, the Shepeheard vexed with his
ancient passion (renewed by a fresh conceit of an other imagination) brake
into this complaint, which as a testimony to Pan and the other Nymph, of his
unviolable meaning, he reserved at one time or other in some of the trees
there-abouts to be engraven.

To love alas, what may I call this love?
This uncouth love, this passion wondrous strange,
A mischief deadly, such as for to prove
My heart would shun, if power I had to change.
To change said I? recant again that sownd
Recant I must, recant it shall indeed
Since in my heart so many things abound
As yields desert how ere my fancies speed.
Sweet is the lure that feeds my gazing eyes
Sweet be the looks, that whet my hot desire
Sweet is the harbor where my quiet lies
But to unsweet, the means for to aspire.
Yet must I love? I must, and so I do.
Suppoze it hard the thing whereat I reach
Who doubts but pearls are for the best to woo
And greatest minds to highest actions stretch.
Be witness yet (my flocks) of all my pain
And sacred groves that know my just complaint
Let aie my love within this bark remain
Whom harmefull force have never power to taint.
Concluding in this solitary fantasy the lode-starre of his happiness, who
for a little time after the departure of Philetas, had wandered down to the
rivers, approaching apase, the very appearance of whom was as the comfortable
Sun in the Spring time, casting his radiant beams for stirring up and
quickening of all earthly creatures. Their entermeeting together was not
without the accustomed pleasure and torments, the mixture whereof, neither
grew altogether exempted from the danger of one other particular most strange
kind of accident, and thus fell out the matter.

There was a company of rich and wealthy youths of the town of Metelene, who
intending to take a little pleasure on the water, coasted in a calm sea, as it
happened from the territory of their own city, down along the coast of
Metelene, the bourenesse whereof, made the passage the more pleasant, in that
the same is curiously decked with fair and most excelent buildings. These young
men, passing along as they did, by the Island side, landed in diverse places at
their pleasure, not offering violence or hurt to any thing, but quietly still
took the delight they came for, and departed. They fished, angled, and fowled,
with ginnes, nets, and hooks at their pleasure, and the country being
fertile of it self, they not only satisfied their delight with present
pastime, but filled also the table the better with good vittelles. And
for so much as their intendment was only to be merrye abroad, they resolved to
fasten their boat for one night, with their cord upon the sea side, and there
continue themselves in a town hard by upon the side of the Island.

It chanced that the vintage, not yet being fully gathered in, the laborers
working in the night as well as by day, one of them by occasion, had to use a
strong cord, which for that he had none of his own, he went to the coast hard
by, and took the cord wherewith the boat was fastened. These youths in the
morning, seeing the hazard of their boat, being so at liberty, made earnest
inquiry of the wrong done, but the party that did it could not be found:
wherefore chiding with their host alittle for the injury, they retired back
again into their vessel, and having coursed up along the coast about two
leagues and more, they came at the last on that part of the country where
Daphnis and Chloe pastured their heard together. And for that the soil on
that side the coast was altogether large and plain, almost without any covert,
they determined to land there again, and to have a course or otherwise to
hunt, with their dogs or hounds, if so they might be suffered. For which
cause they alighting all together from their boat, drew the same as near to
the shore as could be, and cutting down the branches from a green oziar
standing hard by, they wreathed the strongest of them that they could bend,
and therewith fastened their boat safe enough (as they did think) to the land.

Being now on the plains furnished with their dogs, hounds, and other
necessaries, they began to place their toiles, on those sides and places that
to them seemed convenient and necessary, but their dogs coursing very evil,
ran here and there very disordered, insomuch, as leaving the game, they
ran into the midst of the herds of Daphnis and Chloe, and their
continually baying at their very heels, fraied so much the goats and sheep,
that all of them began therevppon to be immediately scattered, whereof the
most part of the goats turning directly upon the sea coasts, Daphnis ran
after the one part of them, and Chloe after the other.

The goats there continuing, and having neither bush or ought else to browze
upon, got them to the oziar wreath, with which the boat was fastened, and
browzing two or three of them upon it, quickly riued the same in sunder,
whereby the boat being loosed, floted, by reason of the violence of the waves,
immediately upon the seas. The Methiniens misliking their sport, and drawing
down unto the coast, missed the boat, and enraged deeply by reason that with
such misaduenture, the same, by tempest was thus vehemently carried, had no
other revenge, but altogether fell upon the poor and solitary Daphnis. Now
had the shepherd no mean to make any resistance against a multitude, but
defending himself as he could, he kept them back, till he had cried and
called for more aid. Whereupon Lamon and Dryas, old Philetas and others a
number, that were nerest about them, came forth, and desirous to know the
cause of the grief of the Methiniens, they declared, as before you have heard,
that being at their sport, and having fastened their boat with a strong oztar
band, the goats of Daphnis by their evil attendaunce and keeping had browzed
the same in sunder, wherein their apparel, money, iewelles, and diverse kinds
of provision being, in the same by misaduenture of the looseness and tempest
was utterly lost.

The whole fault and accusation hereof, they utterly laid to Daphnis, and for
sentence therein they were content to be adjudged by Philetas. Daphnis, he
contrary-wise pleaded for himself, that in keeping his goats there a long
time together they never did spoil or offense to any man, but that the badnes
of their hounds, and their own unskillful hunting driving themselves amongst
his herds, made them to take the seacoast, where whilst he was gathering the
greatest number together, two of them lay browzing upon the green oziar
without his knowledge. Philetas having heard both allegations, freed Daphnis
fro hurt, and imputed the whole fault as it was to the Methiniens, the young men
enraged herewith, began to stand upon force, and answered, that either they
would have Daphnis as slave for the trespass, or otherwise be there
recompensed their losses.

Here-vppon ensued on all sides a great hurlie-burlie, and the Metelins drawing
in still to their aides, the Methiniens were quite beaten out with their losses
and discomfited. Being returned home to their City, they enforced
marueilouslie to their rulers, the wrongs received by the Metelians, not only
affirming, that they had beat them, but stoutly also and untruly inserted,
that they had robbed and taken their goods from them. The Methiniens conceiving
great dispite hereof in such sort to have their citizens used, and they
also descended of their most noblest parentage and houses, denounced
immediately war in open field against the Metelenians for the reuengement of
these wrongs, but sent them no word at all of this their speedy intendment.
For the accomplishment of this exploit, they gave charge and direction to their
Captain only for the arming and furniture of 12. galleys, commanding him
with the strength thereof, to enter the fields and teritories of the
Metelenians, and without all pity to forage, wast, and spoil them of all they
could get. And farther strength then this they thought not meet at this present
to send, winter drawing on as it did, and therefore the less meet to trust a
greater flote on the sea, than those which were in such manner by them prepared
already.

The captain slacked no time, but furnished with all things necessary, coasted
that part of the country of the Metelene, which altogether bordered upon the
sea, and on that side of the land next unto them, foraged and wasted all the
country over, carryeng away diverse and sundry booties and prays, as well of
cattle, corn, wine, and a great multitude besides of prisoners, all for the
most part laborers, and such as at that instant help in with the vintage.
This done, he proceeded further, and foraged also al along the plains, where
Daphnis and Chloe maintained their pastures, and they being there in like
manner, as the others unprovided of any resistance, they took and did what they
would on the borders. Daphnis was not as then with his heard, but traveled a
little way to gather green boughs for his young and tender kids to browze
upon, and seeing a far off the great concourse and foremost entrance of his
enemies, crept into the hollownesse of a certain crooked passage under a
rock, and there hid himself. Chloe was then a keeping the flocks, who no
sooner perceiving the brute and outrage already begun, took her to flight,
and thinking to save her self by swiftnes, got into the cave of the Nymphs. But
the foragers having quick sight of her, followed the tract so near, as they
pursued her even hard to the very cave. There seeing no other remedy, she fell
flat unto the soldiers, and prayeng them for the reverence and regard due
unto the Nymphs, that would tender no hurt, neither to hirselfe, nor to any of
her beasts. But this petition of hers prevailed not, for the Methinian
soldiers after many villainies and dispites, done and uttered in dirision of
the Images, led both her and her beasts away as a spoil, chasing and driving
both her and them before them, in most cruel manner, and without any pity or
compassion. And seeing now that they had fully laden their gallories, with all
kind of spoils and booties of every sort, they ceased to tire themselves any
further: but fearing the uncertainty of the winter weather, besides the hazard
of meetings with any enemies, they desired now none other, but in safety to
return home to their own houses, and finding the weather sortable to their
purpose, they laid strength to their ores, and made way abroad, the season
being so calm, as there was not so much as one puff of wind wherewith to
resist them.

When all the harrieng of this great spoil and brute was at the last appeased,
Daphnis sorted himself out of his hollow rhine, and came again into the
plain, where he left their herds when he went a feeding, and finding there
neither goats nor sheep, nor any news at all either of them or of Chloe, but
only the empty fields and plains a lone without any other creature or
company, and the flute whereon the Nymphe sweetlye was wont to sound, cast
down and lying on the ground, his heart sweltred within him by exceeding
sorrow, insomuch as he was not scarce able to stand, but lykelie foorth-with
to have swooned, and shedding forth abundance of tears, so great was his
grief, as he could not choose but cry out upon Chloe, and that also right
biterlie. First ran he to the foot of a hie and vmbragious rock, whereon
customablie they both were wont to sit and talk togethers, and not hearing
any news of Chloe thereabouts, he then trudged as fast as he could down to
the sea coasts, and there not finding her, he last of all returned to the cave
of the Nymphs, whether him seemed at the first incursion of these soldiers
she made haste to fly, and casting him self down prostrate there, at the
feet of the Images, he entered into these or the very like complaints
delivered in verst before them.

What grief alas, what hell unto my woes?
What sorrow may exceed my foul mishap?
What more excess than mischief where it flows?
Or deep despair that all my woes does wrap?
Unhappy downs, what ailed wicked spite
To reaue from you and me, our sweet delight.
My tender kiddes if ere your loving skips
You bear in mind, and on this pleasaut dale
How many times your young delightful trips
Have Daphnis mo'ud to mourn his bitter bale
Then for his sake that whilom was your guide
Yield forth your plaints, and griefs to you betide.
Ye mournful flocks dispersed where ye go
To uncouth pastures yield my drearie tunes
Lamenting tears, and sighings full of woe
Wherein my thoughts for Chloes love consumes
Let be your food, and your tender walks
Conceive the sorrow that my pleasure balkes
Return to me your stately herds. Return
My heart, my joy, my comfort and my care.
My blisfull Chloe once again return.
Ye sacred Nymphs, or death for me prepare
Seal up your springs, and praise in secret lie
If Chloes rape do cause her Daphnis die.
Infinite were the complaints that the seemly shepherd made in the Cave,
missing the sweetened society of his chiefest dearling. One while exclaimed
he, on the hills, the dales, the springs, the groves and broad stretched
shades, each one of which he invited to lament the loss of her, whose
presence he adjudged unto them as to him self to have been the greatest
comfort.

Then converting himself again to the Statues in the cause. O ungrateful
goddesses said he, that have so suffered her, who honored your being, with so
many sweet regardes, to be thus ravished between your hands. O negligent of
her whom committed to your charge being an infant, you would thus suffer to
become a pray to so vile and wicked persons. Why showed you not your mighty
powers in so manifest contempt done unto your Images* your Statues, and these
springs? what ^ooted me in all the time hithertoo that I have guarded my
herds upon these downs, in which never the woolfe could so much as bereave me
of one of my kiddes, when now at one instant the enemies have carried away the
whole flocks. Alas Chloe bear thou the like pain of thy seely Daphnis,
being now estraunged from me by foreign rouers? or remembrest thou at all
these fields, these valleies, these Nymphs, or him that waileth for thee now,
in this most unfortunate state? Oh if the sound of my lamentations may any
ways be carried to those lands and seas wherein thou art (alas to far from
me cooped) pity yet his distress, who desperate of all other comfort than
that which he solie expects in thy happy presence, sigheth and evermore
longs after thee. O Gods and Nymphs, to whom these woods and walks have
at any time bin charie, revenge the wrong done unto those who have honored you,
and let not my unfortunate heardes and fairest bewty of my dear Chloe become
an honor to that their cruel conquest.

Having run himself a great while into these and such like woeful
remembrances, (as it often happens unto minds surcharged with too extreme
sorrows) a broken slumber surprised at last his restles fantastes. And lying
before the statues of the Nymphs in such kind of Ecstasy, there appeared to him
in a vision, three women seming by their port to have bin goddesses, their
attire altogether Nimphlike, their countenances freyght with manifest
pleasures, who yelding unto him sondrie and most amiable graces, appeared to
put forward to his relief many occasions of comfort, Afterward the most
excellent. as well in stature port and bewty of them all, casting upon the
forlorn shepherd, her amiable gestures, said unto him: Cease shepherd, thy
plaintes and incessant ^mentations, and henceforth be recomforted, assuring thy
self that thy Chloe is, and shall continue in ^auerie. The Nymph is ou^
charge, to whom her years and education have bin committed from her for^st
cradle, and being left an infant in this ^aue, we have purue^ed hitherto for
her, and so will continue to have special conceit and respect toward her.
Think not Daphnis that she is the daughter of Dryas, or borne in this village
as thou have supposed, or that this estate and calling wherein she now is,
befitteth her place and parentage. But know that in keeping her flocks here, and
doing unto us obseruances, we have sufficiently laid down and provided what
shall become of her, and to what end remains both your fortunes. She is not,
n^ shal^e lead away prisoner* to Methimne, nor shall as thou doubtest become
any part or parcel of^he it spoil. To assure thee the better whereof, know
that we have made means unto the god Pa^, who resideth hereabout this large
Pine, to become favorable and aiding to ou^ purpose, for that his power is
more pliable, and better exercised then ours in fea^es of war. He is even
now parted from us, and go^ forwards at our requests in the cause, intending
to become a dangerous enemy to the Methimnians* Wherefore be of good courage,
and raise thy self fr^ this solitary Cave, go ^ome to thy fostering parents
Lamon and Mirtale* and show thy self unto them for their better comfort, who
supposing thee with Chloe to be taken, and spoiled in this hurly hurly* have
serched and sorrowefulli^ sought the round about these pastures. Thy Chloe, or
ever the fair (...) next* shall have (...) veiled of her purple cover powdered
with glimp sing stars* together with both your flocks, whole safe and entier,
shall be here again returned unto thee. Such is the pleasure of the Nymphs, that
have endeavored to perform this with such speed, in demonstration of the love
and care they have of thee*

Daphnis, asser^eined in his imaginations of the truth of this vision, a ^ooke,
and weeping as much for joy, as h^e did (...) for sorrow, made his devotions
before the Nymphs, and there vowed that ^f according to their promise his
Chloe, and flocks v^ble mi^ed were returned* he would then sacrifice (...) end
of his fa^test (...)* And running from thence incontinent, towa^ds the image of
the God (...) who appearing* vnderne^ the (...) had the feet of a goat, and
two horns on his head, and held in one of his hands a flute* and in the
other a young kidoe, leaping as i^ were and skipping about him, he also made
his prayers to him; to become forward in the purpose, promising in like sorce
unto him one of his hiest and stateliest goats. The evening drawing on, he
took up the twigges and small bows which he had gathered for his goats, and
departed home to Lamon, who glad to see him, contrary to expectation to be
returned in sauetie, rejoiced with his wife Mirtale.

By this* time now the captain of the Methimenians, having long traueiled on
the seas in his way homewards, and laden with great spoils, and finding his
people also to be something ouerweried, thought to take a harbor hard by, and
there a while with vic^uals and some rest to refresh them. And finding at the
last a place convenient did there cast ankers, and gave them to all manner of
sport that might be to delight them, as those that besides the rich booty they
had taken, had no want of wine or other delicate viandes, that the Island
whence they came, could any ways afforde unto them. And careless as they were
of all things, freed and secure of foes or (...) other hazard, it seemed at
night in the midst of their vanqu^ing, that all the land about them was (...)
fire, and a sudden noise arose in their hearing as of a great fleet, and
armed navy for the seas, approaching toward them. The sound whereof and ^re
adf^ll sight, made some of the^ to cry Arm Arm, and others to gather
together their companies, and weapons. One thought his fellow next him was
hurt, an other feare^ the shot that he heard ratli^ in his ears, this man
thought his companion slain hard by his side, an other seemed to stumble on
dead carcasses. In brief* the hurt^e and tumult was so wonderful and
strange, as they almost were at their wit^es ends.

This great afr^ie continued in such sort as you have heard all the night long,
and that in so terrible manner as that they vehemently wished for the day,
hoping in the appearing thereof to be relieved. But yet their rest grew not by
the mornings show as was expected, but rather the light thereof discovered
unto the^ far more fearful and strange effects, for the goats and kiddes
of Daphnis were all wreathed and environed about their horns with vine-leaues
and grapes, their weathers, sheep, and lambs, howled as woolues, upon diverse
of their heads were garlands of pine-trees. The seas also themselves were not
void of these wonderful shows, for when they that ruled the oars went about
to stir them, they shiuered all in fitters. When they went about to ^oyse
up their ankers They cleaued fast to the seas.

The dolphins tumbling about their vessels, bounsed them so hard, that they
were ready to fall in-sunder, and themselves to be drowned in the seas. A
dreadful noise was heard from the rocks, not as the sound of any natural
crumpets, but far more shril and hideous, which showed an onset to be given
upon them by some weighty armies. Whereof the Methimnians being in exceeding
dread, hurled altogether to their weapons, supposing, that the enemies from
whom they had re^t that spoil, had come upon them on a sudden, without
giving them respect to gather their weapons.

By the conceit hereof may easily be gathered, how Pan the mighty sheep
heard joining with the Nymphs, became aiding to their petitions* and that
exercising upon these cruel rouers, the power of a god, he delivered (...)
their knowledge, how the mighty powers were not for some cause or other pleased
with those their spoils and robberies. But the occasion by these Methimnians
could not be diuined, for that they could not imagine themselves to have rest
away any thing sacred either to Pan or any other of the Nymphs. And being as
they were in this muse, about the midst of the day, the captain of their
galleies (not without express divine providence) was cast in a deep and
heavy slumber. And as he lay sleeping in his cabine, to the great amaze of all
the company, considering those tumults, Pan himself in a vision stood right
before him, and being as he was in the shape (...) the Pine before described,
he used unto him these or the like speeches following.

O cruel and mischief us sacre^egers* ho^e have you dared with ^o great and
uncontrolled boldness, in arms and show of wa^* to enter thus cruelly upon my
haunts and pastures, dear unto me alone, as whereupon reposeth my special
delights, why have your (...) from the my stocks and herds, my cattle* and
beeues, and so thereby dishonored my walks and valleis, they resting as
parcel of my charge, and under my sole protection? And not contented herewith
have most contemptuously, and in greatest dispite that might be of the Nymphs
and of me, who have seen it with our own eyes, carried away the fair sheep
heardesse Chloe, even when she remained in the cave, as committed to their
patronage and charge. I here protest and denounce unto you, as I am the god
Pan, and as the* lively flocks and herds, are unto me of sacred pleasance,
that no one of you shall ever see Methimne again, if you do but so much as
make mean to pass forwards with this pillage. Nor shall you escape the wreake
of those hideous soundes that you have heard, without leaving so much as one of
you alive* but that the sea it self shall soake you up, and your carcasses
become a food unto the fishes: Render therefore back again unto the Nymphs
their Chloe* ou^ to me the flocks and herds you have taken, and set them
immediately (...) land, that I may conduct them back again into their haunts
and pastures, so doing, I may remit the residue of the wrong, and suffer you
in saftie to (...) again into your countries.

The Captain whose name was Briaxia, being awa^ed, of this vision, grew into
greater fear and amaze of this heau^ charge and speeches. And calling together
his soldiers and companies, he caused present search to be made for Chloe
throghout all the galleis, among their number of prisoners, and she being
found with a chapelet of the Pine tree leaves upon her head, he declared unto
them the express commandment and direction of the god: which done* they all
by o^ consent set hi^ al and. Chloe was no sodner parted out of the vessel
where she^ was, but they heard from the hie rocks a sound again, but nothing
dreadful as the other, but rather much sweet, me lod^ous, and pleasing, such
as the most cunning sheepheards use* before their flocks and herds, leading
them unto their pastures* (...) noise whereof the goo^es, kiddes* and sheep
together with their tender lambs, issued over the ^ankes* without fear or any
regard at all of evil, skipping and leaping about Chloe* as if they seemed to
have i^iutly with hi^ reioiced at their present deliuer^ are* But the other he
(...) and flocks with them did (...) save only these, to whom it seemed,
appertained the sound from the rock, wherewith they aloue were called. This
showed unto the beholders a great wander which made them fearfully to regard
the power and puissance of the mighty Pan. An other thing as strange also as
this was showed unto them, for that the sheep and goats of Chloe led by the
only music, without them of any person at all that conducted them, followed on
the pastures, and fed together as they went, as if they had been thereunto
guided.

It was now about the time that the heardsmen after the midst of the day
passed, did accustom to drive their beasts and flocks to be pastured, when
Daphnis a far off from the top of a hie mount watching the time of his
delightsome Chloes appearance, perceived her coming with their herds.
Whereupon descending with all haste possible into the plains, with intent to
meet her, he called and cried with loud voice. O sacred Nymphs, O honored and
gentle Pan, and without being able to speak the rest, he ran wi^h maine force
unto Chloe, and embracing her fast in his arms, grew so vehemently surprised
with the thought, that he had no power to unloose himself again, so great and
exceeding was the joy whereinto he was whelmed, by the sudden and long looked
for sight of her desired presence. But Chloe during this long embracement, so
lovingly chafed his spirits as that she quickly recovered his surcharged
conceits again. And then recounting together this long seeming time of ^their
short disseuerance, impatient each one at the rehearsal of the others euilles,
they got them to the vmbragious rock, wherein erst they were accustomed with
great pleasure to be recreated.

There being set, it is not like but he with great desire serched of her the
manner of her ^ereauing, her using and entertainment during all her absence,
the sum and effect whereof she gently recompted unto him, not forgetting,
there-withall the hazards and dangers that for her sake they were in, and
finally, how that by the gentle conduction of Pan, she thitherto had been
guarded and delivered, whereat the youthful sheepeheard wondering, and knowing
how mightily his prayers had wrought in the ears of the Nymphs, he likewise
unfolded to her his fortune for his part reckoned unto her his griefs, his
search, lamentation, and all things that ever he had heard or seen in her
absence.

Now when they had thus each to other recounted their griefs and cares, and
seemed both of them to be well contented and eased of their ill happes, they
then devised of these their joyful meetings, to send word to Lamon and Dryas:
and only to make preparation thence-forth for their promised sacrifices.
Daphnis having performed what he would or desired herein, the ancient
heardsmen were by this time come, wherefore they devised immediately to go
forward to their sacrifices. Daphnis for himself first wreathing the young
horns of one of his fattest kiddes, with broad vine leaves, in sort as at the
appearaunce of Pan to the captain Braxia, they were decked in the galleis, he
brought the same before the cave of the Nymphs, and there slaying the kidde,
did flea off the skin, and sprinckling wine and milk thereon, hung it up
before the Nymphs for a memorial, then banquetted they with the flesh by
themselves, and with many praises and notable ditties framed, in their sweet
remembrances, prayed all together the Nymphs to become unto them for evermore
favorable and gracious.

But the next day approaching unto them with a novel pastime, brought also a
new kind of observance unto them, the manner whereof they wholly dedicated to
Pan, in whose honor til this time, neither Chloe nor Daphnis had ever employed
any service. To this action also were aiding and assisting both Lamon and
Dryas. Daphnis thinking no reward sufficient to him that had done him so great
a benefit, as not only to restore unto him again his herds whole and sound,
which utterly else had miscarried, but also to bring unto his bosom again his
Dear Chloe, which of all other things earthly, he most observed, took forth
of his hear^ the goodliest and fairest of all his goats, amongst the which he
choose the greatest and most principal bucke, him decking with wreathed bows
of the goodliest Pine, and al bedewing his forehead and horns with new wine,
and the milk of one of his speckled goats, he began to make ready his
sacrifice.

To this new observance done to the god of sheepeheardes, came also the good
old man Philetas, and with him his youngest son Syterus, and filling his lap
with bunches picked of the finest and most deintie grapes, fruits strange and
dellicate for that season, Myrtle bows, and pomegranats yet hanging upon the
branches, and enuironned with their green leaves, he approached the Image of
Pan, and honoring the same with these sundry presents awayted the rest that
should be done and performed by Daphnis.

Before the pinetree where stood the image of Pan, compassed as it were in a
tabernacle, there was an alter pastoral made of a great square stone, fit and
propo^cioued in ancient time to the shepherds God, whereon the oldest
sheapheardes and greatest heard kepers, were wont for the sauetie of them and
their herds yearly to perform diverse offerings and banquers, the recordation
whereof, brought good Philetas to this pastaunce.

Thither Daphnis having brought his gift, killed the same besides that stone,
and taking off the skin with head, horns, and feet, hanging still about it,
fastened the same to diverse branches of the Pine, and hong it over the image of
Pan, then causing the flesh thereof in diverse sorts to be dressed, they
spread their clothes on the stone, and therewith first of all began to furnish
their banquet. Then took Philetas in the honor of Pan and Bacchus, a great
goblet of wine and milk togethers, and drunk thereof as much as he would,
and gave it afterward to Daphnis.

During all this feast, appointed to the memorial of this seemly
sheepheardesse, the ancient heardsmen and sheepheards, when they had well
drunk and vitled themselves together, took great delight to record amongst
them, each to other their travels passed, then began they to reckon the
sports and pastimes of their young years, their feeding of flocks, and keeping
of cattle togethers, their prizes won by diverse kinds of actiuities, their
shepherds loves, their lays, their many and hard kind of adventures to
compass their likings: and finally, out of all these, how many dangers and
threatened perilles, as well by thieves, as otherwise, both by land and sea they
had escaped. One of them vaunted himself in his youth to have killed a mighty
woolfe, an other, that with ginnes and trappes he had been the destruction of
sundry ravening wild beasts, this man declared how well and thriftily he had
kept his cattle, only aged Philetas, forgeting these long passed memories,
recorded how many times before all the heardsmen, and all that honored Pan upon
their downs, he had in the service of Love, and sound of al their brauest musik
gained the victory: Insomuch as, but only Pan himself with his sweet Syrinx,
there was never any shepherd found, that in his days was able to excel him.
The praise of this Philetas skill, hartned the fresh and jolly Daphnis with his
fair Chloe, to pray of him, that at that instant in honor of the gentle Pan,
he would manifest unto them some part of his science, as the only gift wherein
they had greatest desire to be instructed, and wherewith the god of shepeheards
delighted most to be saluted. Philetas would not deny them so just a demand,
albeit he something excused himself, by reason of his great age, which
permitted him not so good breathing, and of so long con^nuance, as whilom in
his youth he had. Notwithstanding, he took in hand the pipe of young Daphnis,
and began to profer thereon, but he found the smalnes thereof to be too little
to comprehend thereon any excellency of cunning, as being the pipe of a young
beginner, and such as whereon a man so well practiced, as himself was able to
show no great skill. For which cause, he sent his son Tytirus to his lodge,
which was distant from thence but half a mile at the most, willing to fetch
him his own pipe. Tytirus throwing off his iacket, tripped as light as does
the tender fawn, running away in his shirt, to show unto Philetas, and the
rest, his agilitie, and great nimblenes, during whose absence, to the intent
thereby somewhat to recreat the hearers, Lamon took upon him to recount in their
presence* the history of the fair and beautiful Syrinx, which he said he
heard in his youth delivered by a Sicilian goat-heard.

The company gave heed to his speaking, and Lamon thus began thereupon in their
hearing. This Syrinx, said he, the music whereof has been from Pan recounted
always so excellent, was not by the foremost antiquity thereof at the first an
instrument* but was a fair young maid of favor and feature most singular and
perfect, well loved she to chaunt and sing forth her lays, with grace most
wonderful, and harmony right pleasant. Often frequented she the downs, and
had great felicity in keeping her flock. The sheep she fed stood amazed on
their pastures, and when they heard her tunes, immediately they left their
appetite of eating. At her voice they danced and skipped, the lambs themselves
frequented her sounds, and at the hearing thereof, would trip upon the hillocks.
The Nymphs regarded much her music, and had her oftentimes to accompany their
disports. Pan frequenting at this instant the fields and pastures, and having
pleasure to chase the fewnes and kids round about the groves, heard upon a time
the fair Syrinx, sitting by a pleasant fountain under the shady thickets,
melodiously to deliver forth her tunes, and hearing the wonderful and variable
notes she sang, drew near and near unto the place, and ^eeing that as well
with excellent cunning, as with most rare and p^erring beauty she was
replenished, he boldly stepped to her, because he was a god, and prayed at her
hands the thing he most desired, and being exceeding amorous as he was, he
began to tempt the Nymph with gifts, and many other fair promises, saying,
that if she would incline to his love, he would cause, that twice a year her
sheep and goats should yeane and bring forth their young, and for the greater
increase of her flocks, should have two at once, besides, the pastures should
unto them be evermore fruitful.

But Syrinx nothing regarding these amorous offers, unto her made by the god,
scoffed rather at his shape tha^ otherwise, saying she aspected not the love of
any one much less of such as he, who though he were a god, yet was in
proportion more like to one of y^ goats of her troop, than to a man. The god
angry at her disdaineful usage, intended to take her by force, but she
preventing his fraud by flight, endeavored to escape, and he still pursued her.
And feeling hirself in thend to be greatly wearied, she sudenly got at last
among the reeds, and therein creeping from place to place, woond hirselfe out of
sight. But Pan enraged with greater vehemency than before, in that he could
not overtake her, curte down the reeds in haste, in mind to seek and sue
after her, and not finding any thing else besides the marshes, for that she
was utterly vanished, he then perceived the great inconvenience whereunto he
was driven, and sorrowing greatly for the Nymph, whom he knew to have been
converted into a reed, he cropped the same reed also from the place, and
thereof framed in seven quils his artificial and excellent pipe, the most
sweet and delicate instrument of any other, the pleasantnes whereof recording
yet the melody of her from whence it came, bears at this present the prize
and honor of music among all the sheepeheardes. Lamon had no sooner finished
his discourse, and that Philetas with all the rest had highly commended it,
but Tytirus was quickly returned again with his fathers pipe, which was
composed of diverse reeds great and small togethers, trimmed at the tops with
Laton, and to him that had not been acquainted with the difference it might
have seemed the former instrument of Pan, which he had framed out of the fair
Syrinx.

Philetas then raising him self on his feet from off his seat, began first
in gentle sort, to assay the quilles, and finding them to be in order, and
without any impeachement of the sound or blast, he began to show his cunning.
The noise thereof, was questionless most pleasant, and therewithal strange to
be heard, wherein his artificial handling the stops, was such, as he could at
pleasure make them go soft or hie, as him listed. Then began Philetas for the
more enlargement of his cunning, to show unto them upon his pipe all sorts
of pleasures and pastimes that he could, the moodes whereof he handled with
such perfection* as all that he played, you would have thought almost to have
been a thing indeed effected, whether it were in actions belonging to the
feeding and garding of all kind of beasts, which in sundry orderly tunes he
diversely had expressed, or in any sort otherwise.

All the company were whusht and very attentive unto his soundes, without one
word or other speaking at all, till Dryas at the last rising from his siege,
prayed Philetas that he would sound forth some excellent tune in the honor
of Bacchus, whereunto himself likewise daunced, and there handled the manner of
their vintages, one while seemed he to carry the pots, then to bring the grapes
in a trough, after to lade the ^uice into diverse vessels, lastly, to tun
the wine when it was made, al which so promptly and readily he did, and with so
natural a grace, as unto the beholders did minister occasion of great
pleasure, insomuch as them seemed verily before their eyes, to see the vines,
the grapes, the troughs, the ^unnes, and Dryas himself, drinking in very deed
of the newness thereof.

This old fellow having so neat and finely done his deuoire, ran
immediately after to Daphnis and Chloe, and winding their turns next wherewith
to conclude the pastime, the fair young goat-heard counterfeating himself to
be Pan, and she the fair Syrinx in their daunces, he first began to woe her,
and she refused, then would he enforce her, and she then departed, he following
her, she fled, then ran he to overtake her, and she seeming weary, because
the reeds wanted, hid hirselfe closely behind the bushes. Then Daphnis taking
in hand the great flute of Philetas, sounded thereon a dittie lamentable and
piteous, and of one amorous, that knew not to be satisfied: of one suing, and
still was refused, then sounded he the sorrow and grief of his want grown
by extremity, and that in so rufull manner as moved the hearers generally to
compassion and pity, after closing his pipe under his arm, as one desperate
of her he pursued, he chaunted forth in their presence this rufull complaint
following:

Ye heavens (if heavens have power to judge of things amiss)
Ye earthly guides that swaie and rule, the stem of all my bliss.
Ye stars if you can judge, ye Planets if ye know
Of heinous wrongs, that tendered been to men on earth below,
Then judge, reput^, and deem, give sentence and divine
Of all the woe that rues my heart, and causlesse makes me pine,
If right to men of right belongs with equal doom,
Then heavens I pray admit my tears, and do my plaints resume,
Your sacred power it is that yeeldes me bale or boot:
The sighs I spend are else but waste, and vain is all my suit.
I love, alas, I love, and loved long I have,
My love to labor turned is, my hope unto the grave,
My fruit is time misspent, mispending breeds my gain,
My gain is ouer-rulde by loss, and loss breeds all my pain,
Here my ghastly ghost could halt or go awrie,
I ask no favor for my suit, but let me starve and die,
But if by fixed faith by troth I sought to clime
By service long that nere should be shut up by any time.
If only zeal I bear to that I most desire
And choice reguard of purest thoughts has set my heart on fire
Why should not my reward conformed be with those
Whose lives at happiest rate are led and crave aright suppose
If this be all I seek, if sole for this I serve
Then heavens vouchsafe to grant me this else let me die and sterue.
Daphnis having ended his song and music togethers, the old Philetas could
not but commend therein both his youth and very forward invention, and
abashing him self wonderfullye of his so great towardnes, in sign of love and
good affection he bare unto him, he gave him his flute as he that for his
present skill had well showed himself of all others nearest to approach his
cunning. The guyft whereof Daphnis taking right thankefully, offered
immediatlye his own pype unto the God Pan, and after he had fet forth Chloe
and kissed her, as one whom newly he had found and received from a very flight
indeed, the company dissolved here-vpon, and each one returned home severally.
The night drawing on, commanded every man to the rest, y^ days travel also ta
king end, they jointly reposed their herds in their peculiar places But these
two lovers not having herewith fully concluded, al their determination, began
in their going homewards, each one to make a particular interest of the others
affection. And to the end the better assurance thereof might pass to both
their contentments, they jointly agreed to give each to other an
interchangeable oath. In so much as Daphnis first beginning, returned back to
the Image of Pan from under the Pine, and taking his Chloe by the hand, said.

I swear and here protest by the God Pan, through whose sacred aid, I
purchased thy late deliverance, and whom for this purpose I zealouslie do here
call to witness, that Chloe of all others shall ever be unto me most dearest,
and that without her I shall not at any time think my life to be prolonged in
happiness. This done, Chloe leading him also to the cave of the Nymphs, swore
and protested there the like oath in their presence, affirming solemnly that
she would ever live and die with her Daphnis. But Chloe as she that was young,
plain and simple, and unused before time to the fidelity of men's promises,
recounting with her self that Daphnis in his oath had called the god Pan to
be a witness, would needs have in the same cave by oath also to make her a
new promise. This Pan (my Daphnis said she) is a wanton god, very subtle
and amorous, in whom there is at all no credit or affiance, he has been
enamored on Pitys he has loved Sirinx he pursues also daily y^ Naiades, and
likewise the Nymphs Dryades, in him is nothing but inconstancy and change, so
that if swearing by him, thou afterward do falsify thy promise to me
given, he will do nothing but sport at thy deceit, because he is trustlesse
himself, though thy love tend to as many as he has canes in his Syrinx. But
swear thou me here before these Nymphs, by the tender goat, by whose loving
care and suck thou wast preserved, that Chloe never loving any but thee, thou will not forsake her. And when she fails at any time unto thee of the oath
and promise she has sworn before the Nymphs, then chase her here and there,
or slay her at one stroke as if she were a wolf.

Daphnis greatly contented in mind at this hot^ pursuit of Chloe, would do
nothing at all that might impugn their fantasy, wherefore standing before the
cave of the Nymphs, in the midst of his heard, he took the horn of a buck
in the one hand and of a she goat in the other, and there swore unto Chloe the
oath and assurance she required, wherewith the Nymphe being right well
satisfied, esteemed of the sheep and goats to be gods more proper and meet
unto shepherds, whereon to have protested then any other persons, that
thereunto might better be accepted. And sealing up the memory hereof with
manifold embracements, the stars now ginning to pear through out all the
skies, commended the residue of their meanings, to an other days conference,
whereby their love and pastimes were at this instant concluded togethers.

The third book of the loves pastoral of Daphnis and Chloe.
THe brute of these late broiles having greatly enraged the minds and courages
of the Metelenians against those of Methimne, in that without all law and
order of arms, they had thus entered upon and pillaged their lands and
countries, they esteemed it a thing to far unmeet this estate and seigniorie
to put up the reproach of so great a damage, considering that the reputation of
their soil was never before enabled to the dishonorable tolleration of so
heinous and express injuries. Wherefore beliberating with all possible speed
to be revenged upon them, the Prince and council of that state, caused
incontinent to be levied in their Island, an army of seven thousand footmen,
and three thousand horsemen, and thereof made Captain general, a notable and
right valiant gentleman, whose name was Hippasia, commanding them to leave the
sea (for the winter storms approaching) and to march with easy iourneies by
land, into the territories of the enemies.

Hippasia having received his charge, departed from Metelene, and with his
company made such speed, as that in very short space he came to Methimnia,
where behauing himself right honorably, wherein he used neither cruelty nor
tyranny, any in the country where he came, neither fourraged he their
lands, or took at all any pray, spoil, or booty from the poor people or
laborers. For that standing highly upon the honor of a Captain and his own
reputation, he deemed those kind of proferings to be the works rather of some
thief or rouer, than of him that should be a Captain, or among soldiers
esteemed as a general. Wherefore to avoid this slander, and to the intent by
some notable valor to accomplish the matter he came for, he took the direct
way leading toward their city* intending there by force of arms to make
his conquest honorable, and not otherwise, In which pretense he well hoped by
his more then common indus^rie to use so great expedition, as that upon a
sudden he might enter their ports before they had time to know, or leisure
to provide for any resistance at all if it were possible.

But he in this resolution being now come within a six miles of the city,
contrary to all expectation, respecting the great brauado they had tofore time
given, encountered with a Herault of arms sent unto him from the Magistrates
and people of the same. Who had in request with all submission to deliver, that
the Methimnians not seeking war at his hands, or to have to do with arms,
desired only to have peace. And that being informed that the uproar committed
in Metelene, began at the first by the insolency of a few young men of their
city, and only between the peasantes of the Islande and them, and that the
worthiest sort of the Metelenians never consented to the cause, nor had
hitherto till this present entermedled in the matter, they were therefore
hartelie sorry for the injuries by them on their parts offered, and desired
therefore, that as good and loving neighbors, they both might thenceforth
trafique and live anew togethers, and for any wrongs by the Methimnians to them
tendered, or prisoners taken, or spoils made, they were ready to restore and
make amends, in any sort that reasonably might be required.

Hereupon were these articles with other conditions of peace therein also
inserted, and to the Herault delivered in writing, presented to the general
Hippasia, who being a man always honorably conceipted, and well weighing of
the cause in hand, together with the largeness of their offers, albeit he had
in commission by full power and authority to do upon them what manner of
spoil he might or could, yet nevertheless abstained he utterly therefro, and
yet continuing his forces hard by upon them, gave leave and liberty unto the
Ambassadors of Methimnia, to pass through his army, and to go with their
embassage unto their Prince, and both to the same Prince and council,
advertised he also in report the said articles and offers, desirous to know
therein their spedie opinions and pleasure. The considerations of this treaty
seemed unto the Council of Metelene to be of so great consequence, and the
conditions eke of the same to them so honorable, as that upon a little
debatement had with th'ambassage they received their offers, and for the more
confirmation of what on each part intended (after present restitution made of
such wrongs and trespasses agreed upon: and hostages given for a surplusage of
money shortly to be paid unto them) they assosiated other commissioners to
Hispasia, and by effectual letters returned, gave order unto him and them of a
new league and peace to be made.

Hispasia harkened to all things to him on that behalf enjoined, and
traueiling with those persons to whom his authority was here in now annexed,
brought the matter forthwith to very good conclusion. Thus was the Methimnian
war being enterprised and taken in hand by a strange beginning, as soon as
the same came in brute, by this means all at one instant both published and
ended. Toe finishing of this strife, brought the Winters entry upon their
backs: the sharp season whereof, by reason of the great frostes and snowes
immediatlye ensuing there-vppon in so great abundance, became right piercing
and hideous. Now was the uncomfortable time wherein nothing then storms, and
blustering northren blastes were so rife, the snow lay thick lined on the
ground, shutting the poor laborers with the great depth thereof fast into
their houses, the springs ratled down the mountains with their icie streams,
the trees spoiled of their gallant bravery seemed as dead, the earth appeared
no where but even upon the very brimme of the rivers and fountains. It was
now no time to lead the beasts to pastures, nor to suffer them almost to go
out of doors. The freesing Boreas called for great fires, which according to
ancient hospitality of shepherds, was made on a large harth in the midst of
their halles, the blasing show whereof immediately after the mornings cock,
invited each one in the cold frostie seasons, to draw round about it: and
there with far more easy labor then abroad, to dispatch their household
business. The hindes and such as tilled and labored the grounds, took herein
great pleasure, in so much as the bitterness of the weather, became unto them
for the time being, a releasment of their hard endured labor, so that sporting
themselves in diverse household pastimes, they chaunted their country tunes,
and diverse songs accustomed in their vintages to y^ honor of Bacchus.

But young Daphnis, remembering himself of his Chloe and all their pleasures
passed, accused the gods (as enemies to nature, and her goodly bravery) in
this sort to macerate and punish the mother of all earthly creatures, Chloe
whose fancy was also as his, thought some manifest wrong to be tendered unto
Pan and the Nimphlike fountains, in thus discol^ring their dainty springs and
walks, and (...) without mercy upon their nurses bosom, the sweetest of all
their derlings. It jointly grieved them when they saw their sachell wherein
they wont to carry their food togethers, their bottel also wherein their wine
was many times filled, how in a corner they lay despised and unoccupied, the
hills also, the groves, and sweet smelling eglantine, and woodbindes growing
on every bushes, did wonderfully vex them to see how all their glory was
spoiled. Often would they whister and murmur in them selves saying, O when
shall the earth again recover her wonted forces, when will the soft and fresh
colored green with motlie pinkes and sweetest primrosen spring upon these
hard knotted turfes, and clustered clods again. And when they beheld their
flutes and pipes lying by the walls unoccupied, the echo whereof was wount to
resound over all the woods, then grieved it them to think what enterchangeable
notes, each of the^ accustomed thereon to deliver unto y^ other, and how their
sheep and goats, would with great pleasure skip and dance at the hearing
thereof. These and such like reme^braces, renewing in them a kind of pleasure
mixed with sorrow, for their ouerlong debarment of these desired recreations,
made them eftsoon to pray, the Nymphs and gentle Pan togethers, to hasten
their delivery from these cruel evils, and that at the least wise they would
now in the end discover unto them and their beasts the glory of the fair
son shining beams. And in making these prayers unto the gods they began to
imagine of diverse and sundry inventions whereby to compass the company each
of others, but to ^o hard was it for Chloe any way to enter therinto, for y^
she was always watched under the wings of her supposed mother, and kept hard
to spinning of wol and other such country exercises.

There was before the house of Dryas two Myrtes, between whom did grow also
an Iu^e, the veins whereof wound on both sides over the others boughs, on
which the berries were as if they had been bunches of grapes, by occasion
whereof, the winter being hard, and the ground thick with snow, there flocked
thither continually a great multitude of birds, as well thrushes, red-breasts,
larkes, ringdoues, and sundry other fowls. Under the color of these, Daphnis,
by pretense of going a birding, having prepared his lime-twigs and other
necessaries, to come before the house of Dryas, and under the Myrtes
aforesaid, pitched his nets, and laid his lime-twigs.

The distaunce between both houses of Lamon and Dryas, was about half a mile,
and were it not, that the fury of Love is such, as neither feels heat nor
cold, weather or wind, whereby to compass the satisfaction desired, it
happilye might have bin (the season being such as it was) the fowler would have
had little liking at that instant, to have passed between both houses to lay
his twigs, considering y^ the same having no tract at all, so moiled the
laboring sheepeheard, as with long standing afterward in the cold and wet, he
might peradventure have had his pains but hadly rewarded.

But these, and such like wary conjectures, being scaled from Love, the
sheepeheard neither felt nor regarded it, so well able was his youth to
out-countenance the burden thereof. Not long had Daphnis staid there, before
his nets placed, and the twigs thereupon in order prepared, but down came
the birds by heaps, and fluttred immediately, by the legs, he took and kept
which ^e list, and the residue let fly. Then returned he back to his nooke
again, and there watched his birds, and fair Chloes also, to come thither
togethers, but the envious soil had so ramnied in their doors, by
sharpness of the weather, that there was not so much as a cock or a pullet
seen to look out either at door or window. Thus stayed the amorous lad all
the forenoone long, and till also the midst of the day was reasonablye well
spent: his birds were up in his budget, and yet Chloe came not, nor any body
else appeared to take notice of his being there, according as he hoped, and
feign would by some means or other have procured, which seeing the dismayed
youth, he began to accuse the unhappy hour, and vnfauoring planet that reigned
at his foorth-going, deeming that he had not well picked his time, that the
gods were unto his wish at that instant no more favorable: yet resolved he
not so to depart and loose his long emploted travel and watching, but
desperate how by any chance she might have occasion to issue forth, he
began to imagine with himself, what color or excuse most credible, he
might see upon the cause, whereby to take occasion to visit her.

If (said he) I should say I came for fire, they might ask me whether
neighbors nearer hand were not to give it, and so laugh at my folly. If I
should, being thus far from home, and now in fowling, crave of their
vittelles, they might by search of my budget perceive that I had enough. If I
should ask of their wine, why, we are not without our selves, for it is but
the other day since our vintage was in. If I shoule councerfeit a fear of the
woolfe, then where is the trace. If I shall tell them, I came to catch birds,
why am I not then packing when I have done my business? If plainly I should
then deliver unto them how I came to see Chloe, that toie were too plain, for
who is he so simple that would say to a father and mother, I come to your
daughter? Insomuch, as none of these occasions seemed unto him to be void of
suspicion, as that in handling of any of them he could not needs be
descried. For which cause, seeing no way now left to satisfy his intendment,
he concluded to make of necessitte a virtue, saying to himself: Well, this too
cruel season and perverse enemy to our affections will not ever hold, one day
will the spring time be returned to his prime, and then shall I see again at
liberty my Chloe.

Whilst the loving lad was thus concluding upon his impacient affections, and
having buckled up all his trinkets, in full mind to be gone: It seemed that
Love expressly pitieng his hard and over long sufferance, suggested a sudden
occasion, which maruellously sorted to the effecting of this his awaited
purpose. Dryas and his family within doors being ready to have setten down to
meat, it fortuned, their faces being turned from the table, and the meat set
on the boorde, a mastiffe that was in the house, seeing none to regard him,
suddenly caught in his mouth a great piece of meat from the table, and as it
happened, of the best and principal part of the same. Which Dryas seeing, as the
dog chanced to go out of doors, he followed, harrieng, and rating him with
a great cudgel in his hand, and passing along to beat the dog, saw Daphnis
without, yet standing under the Myrtes, with his trinkets on his back. Whom
when Dryas perceived, forgetting at one instant both his dog and meat
togethers, he lovingly turned himself to the young shepherd, and taking him
by the hand, led him into his house.

Daphnis seeing the good fortune hereof, could not frame himself to make any
show of refusal, to that which he had before so fervently longed after, but
entered willingly with Dryas. Where the first object that presented it self
before his eyes, was the sweet Chloe, who meeting also her beloved on a
sudden, with great pain, they both withheld themselves that they were not
surprised and quite overwhelmed with joy, but modesty, and seemly bashfulnes,
casting on her a secret covert, and mere constraint in him, that in any sort
he might not be revealed, they joyfully each for the present saluted the
other, as befitted, and so parting on sunder Daphnis was by Dryas led forward
to Nape to be welcomed.

To tell you of the old Dryas, how much he made of the youth, were wonderful,
for that being once entered, he could not be suffered that night to return
back again. O thrice blessed hap. how favorable wast thou at this instant to
the mutual desires of these lovers, and thou Love, well might it be said,
that thy care in them was not so much as in one jot perished. Daphnis looked
not to be demanded of his carriage, nor what luck he had then in his birding,
but vnbuckling freely his budget, he referred unto his friendly host, both the
choice and plenty thereof, at his pleasure to be accepted.

The days naturally approached at this instant to their greatest shortness,
and now the purple covert of Jupiters segniory, began to take hold in the
element, and chasing the fast fleeting Aurora, into her western cabin, all
bedewed as she was with her duskie snowish covering, made Dryas both in fire,
cheer, provision, and all other intertainements to seek to welcome within
doors his guest. Chloe was not behind hand to do him all the favors she
might, yet was she wooed of a great many, and many wealthy proffers were daily
made unto Dryas to obtain his good will to marry her, but the fair
shepherdess, wholly devoted as she was to an other purpose, freely now
reioiced at the sight of him she liked, but not so frankly, as when besides
the downs they pastured their fruitful herds for the times, and seasons
thereof affoorded unto them a far greater blessedness. Yet Love continuing his
good graces in their auowed furtheraunce, made Dryas and Nape about some secret
occasions to withdraw a little their presence, whereby the amazed youth
surprised at the sudden motion, and Ioth to leese the opportunity, raught
Chloe quickly unto him, and stole from her a kiss ere she was aware. O how
honey sweet unto him was the pressure of those her candie lips, and how much
eased he his mind therein, the content whereof was such as hardly he would
have exchanged for a mighty Seigniorie.

But when the Nymph also began in loving sort to challenge him, and seemed
to counterfeit an amorous mislike of that he meant so near to approach the
place where she was, and yet would not come in, if he had not been of Dryas
required, how near then began his very thoughts to melt and consume him
inwardly, when excusing the manner thereof with some bashfulnesse, she was
feign to pronounce a free pardon unto him, or ever he was able to demand it,
else had he bin in the return of Dryas discovered by his very countenance.

But Dryas having no other mind than how to make cheer to Daphnis* whom by
a more peculiar affection than to any other, he fervently embraced, called for
what might be had to supper, and afterward spent forth the time, until
the length of the night called them to bed-ward, where, with what kind, and
how many sorts of imaginations poor Daphnis reposed, I leave to the full
pleasing content of every lover to be discerned.

The next day calling them forth to the celebration of a certain yearly
feast, evermore with great and most religious devotion honored among all the
sheepeheards from the highest unto the lowest of that Island, and all the
territories thereunto adjoining, made Daphnis (who till his coming to the
house of Dryas, and the preparation there seen was ignorant thereof) to
bestir himself early in the morning, with intent to prepare him also with the
rest to these sacred obseruances, the custom and occasion whereof grew thus.
There was at that present a Princess, by lyneall dissent sprung from out the
ancient and most renowned race of their worthiest Kings, who swaying the
Scepter of that Island* had with great happiness to her people, fame to herself,
honor to her country, admiration to the world, and love to her subjects, in a
farte estraunged manner of policy, peace, and most wonderful success ruled
and reigned by the space of many years over them. Their Queen was then, and
so always continued a virgin, wise was she as the sagest, reguarded as the
mightiest, honored as the rarest, followed as the fairest, and reputed of as
the worthiest: Her years as it seemed, were unto her subjects most precious,
for she might assure herself of all the Princes that lived in her time, to be
most entierly beloved. Her sovereignty and rule in the greatest reputation
thereof, it principallye bare swaie, and chief honor of that Island, yet was
she of ancient, entitled to far greater gouernements, and as then also
besides possessed of larger jurisdictions and kingdoms. The recordation of her
happiness, her rule, her power, her honor, and virtues, for the manifold
benefits thereout daily reaped by her exceeding worthiness, unto the
vniuersalike of all her loving subjects, made this day for evermore sacred
among them, in which she living they in testimony of their inseparable and
grateful piety, love, duty, and affection toward her, with sundry
accustomed triumphs, prayers, vows, feasts, and hanquetings, do jointly
altogether rejoice, and ten thousand times beseech the sovereign director of
all human actions, that long and ever she may live blessed, famous, happy,
and in all her virtuous actions most hie, peireles, and invincible among them.

Of this days reverend and most seemly obseruaunce, were fawtors the greatest
and mightiest of all the Shepeheardes, for that themselves challenging in the
fertility of their fields and flocks, whereby their herds mightily still
increased, and they in riches abounded, to be in this action unto her rare and
most singular clemency of all others most devoted, as they that by her virtues
and long continuance had ever received the greatest benefit, did always
therefore jointly and willingly, foremost of all others proceed in this
enterprise. The youthful and gallantest troppe of them richly trimmed on
horseback and on foot, exercised in her honer diverse and sundry feats of
actiuitie, the rest, and those that were more ancient, attentively rejoicing
and beholding them, Afterward they altogether came to a public place, to that
sole end and purpose, specially of long time reserved, where reuelling and
sporting themselves universally in all kind of shepherds, pastimes and dances,
they sing before Pan and the Nymphs: who reuerencing also with like regard the
Paragon, whom they honor, assent to their tunes and inusique, and yield
thereunto for the greater beautifiyng of the same, al sweetness and pleasure
that may be.

To this feast came the good Meliboeus and Faustus, the young and gallant
Thyrsis, Philetas, and Tytirus, with sundry the most ancient and skillful
shepherds, descending out of the places most stately of all that Island, they
brought thither in sign of their loves, many fair and gallant presents, which
they offered for her safety, whom they honored to the father of the gods, to
Pan and to all the Nymphs. Eliza was the most excellent and brave Princess,
in whose favor, memory, regard, and kingly worthynesse, they jointly thus
assembled, to celebrate with perpetual vows, her famous and long continued
happiness. And to the intent, this festival, as it was the day peculiar and
most principal among the shepherds, and wherein each one then endeavored to
be commended, in the greatest and highest actions, so gave they it a name
singular and proper to their own intendments, calling it universally the
Holiday of the Shepeheards, which in sort following began to be effectted.

The shepherds Hollidaie.
THeir sacrifices, vows and triumphs, with all reverence required being
performed, the most artificial and cunning of the shepherds joined together in
company, and their delivery upon their instruments sundry sorts of music,
having among them all most excellent comfort, and knowing the great worthiness
of Meleboeus, and large account among them that universally he had attained,
they prayed him first, in example to all the residue, to strain his ancient
tunes to the religious advancement of those their forward services.

The grave old man renied not at all their su^es, but gladly taking in hand his
harp, played thereon a right solemn sound, such as (...) Yopas handled in the
banquets of Dido, at what time in her princely palace she feasted the noble
Trojan duke Aeneas, so or more exceeding far^e were the strokes of this honored
shepherd, which done, he reverently uncovering himself, and standing up
before all the company, delivered unto them in song this invention following.

IN stately Romance of the worthy lives,
Of mighty princes free from fortunes grieves,
An such as whilom in their kingly raygne,
Of virtues self were deemed sovereign,
From ou^ the stock of every princely line,
A choice was made of noble worthies nine.
Of these and such as these a many more,
Have diverse Poets written long ago.
In skillful verse and to the world made knewne,
The sondrie virtues in their lives that shone.
For kingdoms well we know and stately ruls,
Possessions large and chair of honors stool,
Gold pearl and stones with jewels rich of ptice*
Large palaces built by deintie rare device.
Yea all the pomp that world can here afford,
Or mass of treasure laid in many a hoorde
Ne are each one but for the room they bear,
A mortal show that earthly honors rear
But when we come to talk of worthiness
Of kingly acts and Princely noblenes,
Of right renown each where that spredeth far
Of honored titles both in peace and war,
Of their decease that ever live by fame.
It Is virtue then that yeeldes a glorious name,
The wealth of Croesus quickelie was forgot
Darius eke his rule by death did blot
And Philips son the Macedonian king,
His latest power in shrowde of grave did bring
King David's son the tipe of sapience
That whilome liud in greatest excellence
His glorious state in life wherein he was,
Is sheuered all like to a broken glass
His rich attire his pomp and daily charge
His rarest buildings, chambers wide and large
His temple huge with pillars stately built
Sweet smelling roof with rafters over guilt
The plated walls of brightest gold upon,
And costly silver fret with many a stone.
His palace and the numbered square degrees,
That from his throne a deep descent contriues,
With equal numbers matched of lions strong,
Of massy gold upholding pillars long
Of marble white, with veins by nature wrought
In precious wise, as rich as may be thought:
His costly throne bright shining to the eye,
That in it self reteind a dignity,
His many pleasures thousands more than one,
In walks, in fruits, in fountains wrought of stone,
In music strange, in sugared harmony,
By sound stroke and voices melody,
In quick solucions made of strange demands,
In sundry arts wrought forth by diverse hands
In women's pleasures and their sugared smiles
In all the gifts of fortune and her wiles
In what by nature could for sweet delight
Befit the mind or please the outward sight
What each conceit imagine could or scan
That might contenting be to any man
All this and more by all that may be thought
On earth to please or liking breed in ought
Were it in skill, in word, or power to frame
The same in him did breed a glorious name
Yet pe^isht is his rich and fine array
So that as erst I may conclude to say
These gifts of fortune, sounds of earthly glory,
Are of themselves but merely transitory,
The greatest Prince, but while he lives in power
Renowned is, and after in one hour
If virtue be not then to him more kind,
His death him reaues full quickly out of mind.
Then not for naught the woorthies heretofore,
That praised were in elder times of yore,
And named chief of many Princes erst
On honors palm to rear a stately crest,
Did study still for virtue by their names,
To be renowned with sundry kind of fames,
As some for zeal and some for piety,
Some for their wars and noted cheualrie,
Some of their triumphs had by lands subdued,
Some of their acts by labors eft renewed,
And each for bounty bright in them that shone,
For which therebe that have been famde alone,
And so of right ought every noble mind,
To vaunt himself by very natures kind,
Who for they were put forth of finest mould,
As by instinct of neat and purest gold
That cleansed is from worst of natures dross,
Or tallest timber growing free from moss,
So is in truth each stately noble wight,
Of very kind, and so should prove aright,
So Alcibiades to his endless praise
The stately lauds of mighty Greece did raise:
So did with Galls the worthy Charlemaine,
So sundry kings in Britain that did reign,
So Albion had her mighty Edwardes, peers
(And Henry's eke) to greatest conquerers,
So has our isle (and ever prays to gain
The joy it has) a peerless sovereign,
So Brutus land inuicted ever lives,
By self instinct it proper virtue gives,
Yet guided still (what virtue else could veil)
By grace divine which never shall it fail,
Such is the cause that prict with former praise,
Of worthy wightes that liud in ancient days
The seeds long since of all their virtues sown,
From time to time are still sprung up and grown.
And springes and buds with ripest fruits are seen,
Of elder stalks that erst before have been,
So virtue swaies (what end of virtues reign
So long vpheld by Peers and Sovereign)
O pierles virtue knit with endless fame,
Do guide my skill and shrowde my Muse from blame,
Thy praise it is, thy mighty praises I
In royal race do seek to magnify
Immortal fawtors sacred sisters nine,
Of sugared arts show forth your powers divine,
Let not your Poet blemish with his vain,
The honored steps of her that sues your train
Yet blemish must he or vnshadowed fittes
Set forth of her, who daunts the finest wits,
Can earthly eyes give in sight to the son,
Or reach the course that Phoebe fair does run,
Can men the waters in a measure hold,
Or think on all that may on earth be told,
Is it in power the skies to comprehend
Or wit of man the stars to bring to end.
With reverence yet though virtue seem divine,
Men may proceed to touch her sacred shrine.
All have not treft he skill to speak aright,
Nor may they aim thereat if so they might,
Immortal Phoebus radiant in his beams
Yields dazzled sight, for gazing on his gleames,
More stately graces mighty powers do shend,
Than meanest wits are apt to comprehend,
Yet feeds Apollo fresh Auroras rays,
And fluttring fowls that chirp with pleasant lays,
So Philomene in shade of gloomy night,
When Dian fair shows forth her silver whight,
Records the comfort of her sorrows past,
By change of times relieved from winters blast,
And as the graces of these beauties sheene,
Enuirond have thee peerless noble Queen
So peereles, for thou art a stately iem,
O care of skies whom God and men esteem
By all thy bounty shed in princely line,
By all thy virtues which are said divine,
By all the favors that thou have from skies,
And every bliss that on thy safeguard lies,
Assent I pray, and lowly I beseech
Unto my muse thy gracious hands to streteh,
Of Shepherds joy, so boldly dare I sing,
And happy sway thy gladsome years do bring,
Of fair Eliza then shall I be pressed,
To chaunt the praise that in her virtues rest.
No other sound shall be to me so dear,
As in my song to praise this goddess peer,
Her noble worthies and her stately knights,
Whose honored acts in sundry valiant fights,
Whose council grave, whose sage advise at home,
Resembling much the flowring state of Rome
Commend the titles of their endless praise:
But first (O Queen) of thee shall be my lays,
THou stately Nymph, that in the shadie groves
The fairest art, of all whom Dian loves:
With quiver decked in glittering rays of gold
Thy maidens bow full seemly do thou hold.
Thy garments are of silver shining white,
Thy feature rare, and filde with sweet delight.
Thy golden tresse like Phoebus burnisht chair
Whom sweet Zephyrus puffes with pleasant air:
Like Venus self (or if but one then she,
Of all the Nymphs may more surpasing be)
Then like to her, or her excelling far,
Thy seemly hue all other features bar.
Thy gestures are on honors placed hie,
Thy looks do bear a princely Majesty.
Thy honored mind with dignity is clad,
Thy bounty rare the like but seldom seen.
And port-like show beseeming such a Queen,
Thy nurse was Skill, Minerua gave thee s^cke,
And Juno pressed to yield thee happy luck:
Thy cradle was on Tempe placed hie,
Within the walks of pleasant Thessalie,
Full often within those virgin years of thine,
Both Ida woods and banks of Muses nine,
Both Pegase spring and forked mountain top,
Have thou possessed, and every root and crop.
That Science yeeldes with all the sweet delights,
Where Poets wont refresh their dulled sprights:
Thy skillful eye by choice has marked eft,
And from thy thoughts they never were bereft:
At morning walks when forth thou list to go,
A crew of Nymphs attend thee too and fro,
Like fragrant smell of sweet Auroras dew,
When as the twins in Titan gin to show,
The freshest prime of all the pleasant year,
When lusty green the brauest hue does bear,
Or like the blossoms hie on branches sweet,
That stilled liquor of the morn has weete.
Or as the beams of Thetis lover true,
When from her bed he is but risen nue,
In eastern skies to cast his cheerful rays,
Fore dulled minds in spring from dumps to rays.
So comst thou forth in royal vestures dight,
Fresh as the Rose, of color red and whight:
The glory great of Brutus great renown,
Distilling favors each where drophing down
The rural gods, about my chariot flock,
That milke-white steeds of Pegase heavenly stock,
With breathing nosthrils spa^ling fire amain,
Do trampling draw, and fomie bits constrain.
Thy virgin sway the gaftly impes admire,
And seek by flight to shun their deep desire,
Which wish to see, and cannot gaze their fill
Upon her shape whom yet they honor still,
Of youthful peers eke issue forth a route
That fiercely mounted hie thy chair about,
Like to the train that once Bellona led,
When on her altars proud they incense shed
Triumphant on the honor and the spoil,
That fell to Rome by mighty Affrickes foil,
They stately stride, and beating earth and skies,
With nighing sound of horses loud that flies
Now here now there, this one, and that amayne,
Does joy himself to show in foremost train,
With curled locks like to the blooming spring.
And colors decked that secret savors bring,
In costly robes of Pallas curious wrought,
Bedect with gold and pearls from Pastole brought,
Then Phoebe like thou gladsome mornings star,
To them appearst, or like the gleames afar
That issue forth before the glittering chair,
When Phoebus first him busseth in the air,
And salued is with favors bright and sheene,
Of her that called in the Mornings Queen,
Who vailing of her hue that is so white,
The darkened shadow of the glomie night,
Distressed hearts that long the day to see,
Forthwith does lade with every kind of glee
Such (gracious Nimphe) so pleasing is thy face,
Like comfort yeeldes thy hie distilling grace,
A heavens repose to seely shepherds is,
To vewe the shadoe of thy heavenly blis,
And when thy pleasures be to rest thee down
Or near the fountain spring at after noone,
Amidst the shades of hiest tops to straie,
To fore the evening in a summers day,
Where coolest blastes of sweet Zephyrus strains,
His gentle breath throughout his pleasant veins
Each chirping bird his notes well tuned hie,
Yeeldes forth to thee their sweetest harmony,
The fairest then of all the gallant crew
Of water Nymphs, that fields and fountains sue,
And such as haunt with silver bow the chase,
Thy virgin steps full meekely do embrace,
The Satyrs and of shepheardes mighty Pan,
Commandes the fields to thy obedience than.
Since Ceres first these thickie groves pursued,
And country soil with sacred walks endued.
Since that Apollos curled locks of gold,
For Daphnis love in tresses began to fold,
Since that Actaeon by the water side,
Transformed was in forest large and wide.
There never Nymphe so chairie was to view,
That did the walks of Phoebe chaste pursue
Nor of such honor blasing in each eye,
Nor crowned so with stately dignity,
Nor to her Peers and vassalls al so dear,
Nor of such port and ever loving cheer,
Ne midst so many that right famous been,
In grounded Science was so thoroughly seen:
Nor better could with Muses al accord,
Nor unto whom the gods could more afforde,
Nor yet of Uirtue held so hie a prize,
Nor in all knowledge deemed was so wize,
Nor kept by peace, more quiet all her days,
Ne happy stood so many diverse ways,
As fair Eliza thou of heavens the care,
The elder times ne may with thee compare,
For if I should thy soueraignetie descriue,
These 29. years for to contriue,
Thy royal state and glory passing great,
Thy wondrous acts if here I should repeat,
Th'unspotted honor of thy princely race,
And how thou rulest now with kingly mace,
The riches that by this thy rule abound,
The happy days that we for thee have found,
Thy bounty shining as the crystal sky,
Thy years replenisht with all clemency,
The load star of thy gracious sweet conceit,
Yea when it was surprizd by deep deceit,
It were a world to think upon the same,
So honored is each where thy Princely fame,
Not English shore alone but farther coasts,
Both of thy name and of thy honor boasts,
In uncouth seas, in soil till then unknown,
Thy worthy Captains have thy praises blown,
And pillars set and marks of signorie,
Aduauncing there thy mighty Monarchy,
And lands subdued tofore by foreign states,
That hear report of these thy blisful fates,
And of thy peereles name so mightly borne,
And how thy Uirtues do thy seat adorn,
The glory of thy stately swaie and power,
That springs up as does the lilly flower,
They sue and seek and humbly make request,
To yield themselves unto thy hie behest,
So sacred Queen so fittes the noble name,
Of this our Is^and still to rule with fame,
So fits that she who others does excel,
Be deemd from all to bear away the bell,
Eft have the shepeheards song thy sweetest praise,
And them ychaunted on their holidaies,
Eft in their feasts they do record thy deeds,
And regal mind whence all thine acts proceeds,
And with half sounding voice of shiuering dread,
As men amazed at thy seemly head,
They with whispering sound as eft thou passest by,
They pray to Jove to keep thy Majesty,
Lo thus can shepeheards of thine honor sing,
That of their ioies, art very root and spring,
Thus Meliboeus of thy honored name,
That from the line of mightiest Princes came,
Of all thy virtues and thy statelines,
Which art the crop of very gentleness,
Rejoices a^e his tunes thereon to frame,
And meekely prays thou shend his Muse from blame.
Meliboeus had no sonner ended his song, but the whole company clapping
their hands, highly commended these his Metaphorical allutions, and there
was not one shepehearde of them all that did not admire his rare and delicate
invention therein. And for so much as in honor of this so stately a personage,
the foremost memory of all their meeting was at the first purposed to be
continued. The shepeheards intending the celebration of this whole day to be
perpetually consecrated to the eternal praises of her divine excellency, and
knowing also teat Meliboeus (greatly devoted to the services of this Nymphe)
had not omitted at many other times before that to pen diverse ditties
aduauncing the most singular parts, that in this Paragon were ordinarily
appearing, they altogether requested him, and he in performaunce of that their
earnest suit, caused his two daughters yet virgins, the one of them named
Licoria, and the other Phoenicia to stand forth, each of which having a voice
sugared with the most sweetest delicacie that might be, and ther-withall in
countenance and gesture naturally adapted, to what might be required to the
most pleasing ear, and best contented eye in augmentation of their melodious
harmony, the eldest first, being Licoria yelding her soft and pleasant
strokes, fit to rauishe the mind of any curious beholder, unto a deintie
harp fastened with a silken scarf cast over her alablaster neck (wher-vnto
by her father she had with rare perfection been instructed) and casting her
modest eyes eft-soones to and fro upon the attentive regarders, manifoldlie
admiring (as it were) in her song, the wonderful graces that therein she
conceived, delivered her tunes answerable to the proportion of all the residue
of her behavior, as in form following the same is repeated.

Phoebus vouchsafe thy sacred Muse to lend
Pieria dames, your solemn tunes apply,
Aid sisters nine with me your deity,
That to your seats these sacred notes may bend,
That you with me, and I with you may praise,
Elizas name and blisfull happy days.
A Nymph more charie far to gods than men,
Of gods beloved. O happy we that know,
O blisful soil where blossoms such do grow.
Vnkindest earth that should not love her then,
Unworthy much of her that loved thee still,
Whose love the gods accept with better will,
People unkind, but those that virtues prize,
You kind by love do know what joy it is
To dwell on soil where peace yeeldes settled blis,
Unkind the rest too much that do deuize
To rue the soil, the seat, the state and al,
Of her, for hirs that lives, and ever shall.
O Nature, were thou now as firm on earth,
By equal mixture with the heavenly powers,
That in the soil where grew such princely flowers,
The brauest blossom sprung by stately birth:
Now living still might ever live on mould,
And never fade (O gods) that you so would.
Virtue be dombe, and never speak of grace,
And gracious Nymphs, that Virtues handmaides be,
Shrowde al at once your sweet eternitee:
Be Virtue now no more, nor in your space
Let grace be set without in large account,
O sacred Queen, thou others do surmount.
Peace be thy nurse to feed thy happy years,
And endless Fame whereon thy throne is set,
To sound thy praise my Muse shall never let:
Live long, and reign in joy among thy peers,
Dear to the gods, to virtue, to thy soil,
Kept by thy grace from pray of foreign spoil.
She having done, the other of the maidens, fair and young Phoenicia nothing
backwarde of the number of all her sisters deseruings, with gracious
countenance replenished in all kind of seemly favors (much like unto
Cydippe when in the temple of chaste Diana kneeling at Delos by reading the
subtle poesy of Acontius in a golden apple trilled before her, she
unwittingly had vowed her self to his choice, and that in the presence of the
goddess, which in no wise might be infringed) her sister yet holding the harp
as before, and couerting the present sound thereof to the Muse in hand, she
thus framed her self, admirable in grace, and surpassing in delivery, she
first beginning, and her sister answering, and both iointlye repeated, as
sorted out in the dittie oftentimes to be contrived.

Phaenicia. Lul pleasant fancy, bring my thoughts to rest


Licoria. O delicate Fancy,


Phoen. The Muses on Ida sweet Phoebus be pressed,
That whilst I admire her who^ heavens do love best,

Lic. This most sugared Fancy,


Phae. Wherewith my delights are fully possessed,
With musical harmony, with songs of delight,

Both All hail noble Princess may sound in her sight.


Phae. Fair Phaebe thou know my muze does not lie


Lico. In chaunting this fancy,


Phae. If pearlesse I vaunt her whom precious in sky
Thou praizedst for perfect to blaze in our eye,

Lico. Extolling my fancy,


Phae. O deintie surpassing sweet Goddess say I,
Enhaunsing thine honors whence all our joys spring,

Both Thrice blisfull Eliza thy handmaids do sing.


No sooner had ended the music, and Meliboeus with his daughters a while
reposed, but Titerus, whose turn was next, prepared himself. And calling
first the immortal gods to witness, how much both him self and all others,
were bound to their sacred deities for the happy enjoying and preservation of
this their pierles princess, willing to honor the feast, and to show how
weightelie he conceived of all their purposes then presently intended, he
framed his ancient years to refresh renewed memory of his youth long since
passed, wherein he was known in all kind of shepherds pastimes to have
excelled. In the recordation whereof perceiving that he was already mellowed in
years, and grieuing that by reason of his drawing age, he was now debarred the
ordinary use of that in which being a bacheler he had so greatly delighted,
(and yet not so far oreslipped, but that both skill and voice reasonably
served, to do any thing, that of the most cunning shepherds might not seem
utterly to be misliked) he ordered his tunes to these proportions, acquainting
thereby the company with that, whereunto those vnpractized seasons of his, had
not of long time before been accustomed.

Since first thy soil O country Pan I knew,
Since on the dales my sheep long time I fed,
Since in my heart the sweet remembrance grew,
Of all these valleis where the Nymphs do tread.
Since first thy groves and pleasant shadie topps,
Thy crystal springs and situate hie prospects,
The sacred dewes which from the branches drops.
That fresh Pomonae on thy grounds erects:
Since all these pleasures thousands mo then one
My ancient years partaked have ere this
The mighty Jove does know wherein alone,
I have repozd the sum of all my blis.
To Tytirus not all the yeaned lammes,
Nor of his flock a rich increase to gain,
Ne sporting hops of young kiddes by their dams,
Are half so pleasing or to him so feign
As are ( Eliza blisfull maiden Queen)
The sweet record of all thy happy days,
Those thoughts to me, full often have gladsome been,
And on these ioies consist my shepherds lays,
O happy soil long happy may thou stand
So sacred be thy mountains and thy groves
So be the walks of that thy pleasant land,
Frequented eft with store of fatted droues,
Let be thy glory like the shining son
That glides as far as does the whirling sphere,
And as the course from whence the rivers run
That through the earth a compass round do bear.
First fail the skies first Phoebus cease to raunge
First crystal dewes back to your springs return
First heat and cold desist your daily change,
And let the fire leave of his force to burn,
Let Phoebe first by night her wandering stay
And darkened be to us the starrie pole,
Let Phoeton lose again the milkie way
And fishes leave to swim within the poole,
Cease birds to fly cease Philomene thy song
And yearly spring that yeldes of fruits increase,
And ycie drops that dangling under song,
Thy frozen chin let ( Saturn) ever cease,
Ere Brutus soil, thou seat of mighty kings,
The ancient race of haughty princes peers,
Ere from thy lap the slip whence honor springs,
By this default do loose the sway it bears,
Ere thou the glory of the present rule,
And honor tied long since to thy desert,
Thy stately conquests near that did recule
With cloked guile do seek for to insert,
But waste thy glory with the mightiest powers
And stay thine honor on the greatest fame,
And selfsame time that al things else deuoures,
Renew thy faith, and yield thee glorious name,
As fair thy fate as are thy happy years,
As firm thy seat as ever Princes was,
Great be thy sway as any strength that reares
The mightiest force that ever man did pas:
And fairest thou of all the Nymphs that haunt
These sacred walks, in which we shepherds wone,
So Jove vouchsafe our springs of thee may vaunt,
As erst before our fertile fields have done.
Tyterus having herewith ended his song, and the shepheardes their music ac
one instant togethers. Thyrsis stood up, a youthful impe seemly in shape, and
as pleasing in behavior as delicate in conceit, sweet were his countenances,
his person generally commended of all the shepheardes: much was he beloved for
that he deserved. There was no Nymphe whatsoever, unto whom either fountain,
or broad shadie woods were of resort but had him in great expectation for the
virtues by him pursuied, and as much remained, he devoted with all obeyzaunce
to the greatest of their services as any shepherd might be. Great was he in
account amongst them, as well for his more then common inclination to the
highest exploits as that by descent he was sprung out of those that whilom in
that soil passed in greatest reckoning. And for as much as his youthful
desires led him forwards to far loftier purposes, then the aged years of the
other seemed for the present to be adapted unto, he converting his Muse to
those delights wher-vnto he was accustomed, used both time and music to this
purpose following.

Give me thy Syrinx, Pan, give me thy flute,
(A worthier music far, beseemes my lays)
In speech of her I tell, the best are mute,
And may not weld the greatness of her praise*
If any Muse of all the Nymphs that stays
About these walks and lovely pleasant springs
Have greater gift then others, let them rays,
The sweetened lawdes that fair Eliza. brings,
And sharpened be my wits, O God of Love,
( Love has men say a fury tha^ts divine)
Yield me the scope of thy delights to prove
And in my breast thy sweetened fancies shrine,
O would my pipe had such proportions fine,
Or that derived from greatest excellence,
My endless skill her fewtures could define,
Whom gods and men admire with reverence,
Vouchsafe my Goddess yet vouchsafe to see*
The will I have to weld so hie aspects,
Yet shall it be henceforth a grace to me,
That Love thy name within my Muse erects,
Much gracious Sovereign it is that Love effects,
Wherein if skilful Pan and Nymp^s me fail,
My active forces shall with large respects,
Compence the rest, and yield me more avail,
Let be as yet for this not all in vain,
My sacrifice, my vows, and prayers eke,
Wherein O Nymphe, thy fame shall aie remain,
Enhaunst by those that to thy Bounty seek.
The wearing away of the day and other brave feats and exercises to be
accomplished, with sundry gallaunt shows in honor and great regard of this
peereles Princes, would not permit the longer continuance of their music
and inward pastimes. Where-fore Thi^sis having in this his last deliverance,
concluded, what for the shortness of the time, might of himself be
propozed, and finding it an endless Laborinth for any of them in distinguishing
her commendacion to enter into the singularities of all her most worthy and
ine^imable praises, which the farther they waded into, the more they intended,
in so much as the same seemed a thing euer-more to be, but never able by any
skill or invention what-soeuer fully to be determined, they contented them
selves with the testimonies already given of their good wills, and as forced
thereunto gave over for the present, gyuing place for the execution of the
rest to the times apt and convenient. Now the night approcheing, they spent in
feasting, reuelling, and dancing, where-in Philetas occupied his pipe whilst
Daphnis and the other youthful heards-men, sported in the counterfeite
disguisings of sundry shapes of Satyrs; to the accompaning where of Chloe and
the rest of the shepherds daughters stood forth, and by them were in diverse
strange gestures sued unto and entreated: But Phoebe being by this time wound
into the highest skies, called fas^ to the rest: where-vppon, as all things
have end, so this religious festival (not thereby ^ing at all) was but unto
the next years solemnities, and after to the perpetuity of their wishes, by
their whole consents discontinued, wherewith, as they that ever wished
happiness, long life, health, ^ie estate and unmatchable prosperity, unto her
for whom they lived, making a great shout in conclusion, each one severed
themselves thereupon, and so for the present departed.

The fourth book of the loves pastoral of Daphnis and Chloe.
THis stately festival and holy day of the shepherds being thus solemnly
ended, Daphnis with great longing continued the winter season, and often took
occasion to watch the birds and his Chloe togethers, until at the last the
pain of this untamed sharpnes vanished, and the fresh colored spring had new
mantled again the withered plants in her sommer^ liuerie. The delight
whereof, none otherwise then is accustomed to the residue of Natures derlings,
rejoiced the hearts of these two lovers, as well for that the occasion thereof
became a medicine to their wanted disseueranc^, as that also the iolitie of the
prime then being in her excellency, revived the dull conceits of every one, and
confounded the winters melancholy before passed, with a new manner tender of
her surpassing sweet nes and bravery. Their herds impatient of their long
penning in, now driven to their accustomed pastures, took pleasure to climb
the ^arkes, and to lift up their horns over the fresh springing hedge rows.
Uniuersall rejoicing was in every thing* and now seemed it a kind of lovely
satisfaction, to call in question their frequented places of conference, of
delight, of disturbance, and of sorrow that had happened unto them.

And as the spring passed in this kind of pleasure, so likewise was not the
summer void of the pastime* the (...) belonging. In which occurred unto them
sondrie actions, as well to the in^endement of their present love, ^s in other
occasions right pleasing. It happened at one time amongst the rest; during
this season that diverse fisherme^ being in y^ se as* and the weather caling,
the sound of their songs and voice redoubled so much, upon the rocks* as
thereon gave a most shrill ^ not able Ecch^ the wonder hereof seemed unto Chloe
very great as she that seldom had bin used to the difference of the same, by
reason of which, supposing that on the other side of them, there also had bin
an other sea, and other fishermen, she began to look about her, demanding of
Daphnis, by what reason they should in their song so well in that manner agree
together. Daphnis smiling at her simplicity, the better to satisfy her
demand, and to inform her at large of the plesures of the ^^^ld, discoursed
unto her the certainty, by revealing unto her the tale of the Echo.

There were (said he) in ancient time (as yet there be) Nymphs of diverse sorts,
some of the groves, some of the woods, some of the rivers, and others of the
springs, and fountains. Of one of these sorts was sometimes a gallant girl,
who was called Echo, she was norished by the Nymphs, and instructed and
brought up with the Muses, the charie account of whom, gave her (besides
favor) a most excellent knowledge and cunning in all kind of songs and
instruments, insomuch, as being come unto the very flower and full prime of
her age, she was for her unmatchable skill deemed fit to be entertained with
their praises, with their companies, and with their pleasures, and being
conversant with them wholly in sort aforesaid, listed not to recke of at all the
company of men, nor of God, but being a virgin by disposition, sought fully and
wholly how to preserve the same.

Pan (my dear as thou know) being a god altogether, amorous* and solacing
himself as his nature is in the woods and pastures, h^ hearing once of this
Nymph, and began thereupon to wonder at her dainty and melodious sounds,
indeuoring (if possibly he could) to woe her to his favor, but when in no sort
he could compass it, he waxed angry at the Nymph, and she being alone in the
fields without any company, he wrought so woonderfully by his power, as that
for mee^e dispite of her favor, he enraged against her all the heat (...) men
and shepeheards of the country where she was, that like woolues and mad dogs
they ^are ^he poor Nymph peece-meale in their ^urie, and throwing the (...)
here and there, as she was yet singing her songs, the very earth ^t self
favored her music* and here acted immediately (...) soundes, in ^orte as (...)
agreeing to this day with the Muses in accord, the same tune that is played
she records, the same song that by any voice is delivered, she repeateth.

The earth thus retaining the former condition of the Nymph while she lived,
when either gods, or men, or instruments of music, or beasts, or Pan himself
sounds his sweet Syrinx over the hollow rocks, it counterfeiteth evermore
the same notes, which the directer of shepherds oftentimes perceiving,
sometimes runs skipping and leaping after the sound, not for desire or hope
he has to enjoy his fair Echo, but only to find by what instinct the manner
of his ditties are so disguised withal, without knowledge, how, or whence it
comes.

The recital hereof grew of such admiration unto Chloe, as that to make
present trial thereof, hirselfe recorded diverse tunes upon her flute,
whereunto the Echo, as it were in confirmation of that which Daphnis had said,
immediately answered, not without the great pleasure of the shepeheardesse, who
had felicity oftentimes to sport hirselfe with those redoubled sounds. But
this daliance of theirs, and sweet society evermore thus continued, could not
yet assure their minds with such safety, as that the same should always have
dured. for that Chloe becoming both tall in stature, and ripe in years for a
husband, the sons of diverse the wealthiest sheepheards frequented earnestly the
house of Dryas, to woo her. And praising in their minds all the complements
of her favor and wonderful perfections: some gave in hand both to Dryas and
Nape many fruitful presents, others promised unto them a great deal more, so
that Nape her self being now also stoong with the covetous gain thereof,
counseled her husband Dryas in any wise to marry her.

And to the intent to move him the rather thereunto, she forgot not to lay
before him her ripenes, and how aduenterous it was to keep in their house a
maid of such beawtie and stature to continue unmarried* putting him also in
mind how that accepting the present offers, he might now marie her to his
profit and her own advancement, but if she fortuned once in keeping of
sheep to lose her maidenhead, they might marie her afterward for roses and
nuttes to whom soever would be contented to take her Dryas, as willing as her
self to finger the coin, and loathe to lose the opportunity in hand, would not
yet ouerhastelie conclude any matthew, for that him seemed still to have a mind
to harken after her parents, and for this cause found he diverse means and
doubts, whereby to delay the matter from one time to an other, whereby the
subtle gnoffe, being of a great many required, obtained also at their hands
great plenty of gifts, the fertility whereof he wished by all policy so long
as he might to draw on unto him.

Chloe was not all this while ignorant of these devises, as she that was a
principal party therein to be acquainted, but sorrowing in her mind of long
time in fear of the disseuerance to be made of her and Daphnis, she at the
last, after much sighing and lamentation revealed it unto him. The young youth
astonished at the first, began to be think himself immediately of the mishap
intended, and his own irrecuperable grief, if the same should proceed to be
effected, but recomforting for the present her sweet imaginations, and over
tender spirits, he declared unto her, that he had good suppose, that if he
demanded her himself of her father, he would not greatly say him nay, for
that he thought he was not so much backward, but that he easily might surmo^
in any thing, but in wealth, the greatest of all the other shepeheards. Only
this somewhat quailed his assurance in that his foster father Lamon was not
rich, but rather a very poor man, and such as no way could devise to satisfy
the courto^snesse of* Dryas. Notwithstanding which, he yet resolved,
whatsoever came thereof, to put the request in adventure, and this to
accomplish, Chloe hir-selfe did also advise him.

Not for all this durst the bashful youth, at the first time to reveal it to
Lamon, but rather chose, as with whom he might be most boldest, to make
known his love before hand to Myrtale. Myrtale, she held ^o secret of it* but
the same night also told it to Lamon. The blunt fellow, quite contrary to
expectation, accepted the motion but very badly, calling his wife, beast, dol^
and sottish ass, that so rashly without consideration at all, would become a
mean to bes^w their (...) (whom of what parentage he was descended they little
knew) upon a simple (...) heardesse, the testimonies of whose reputation, being
found with him, did promise unto them a far better fortune, and whose
parents, if happily by his being in their custody might be found, it might not
only perchance be a mean to infranchize them from that their yoke of
servitude, but happily also enrich them with possessions of greater value than
those that then they lived upon.

Myrtale hearing her husbands conjecture, would not for this discourage the
youth in his fancy, for fear least quenched of all hope thereof (being so
sharp in love as he was) some worse matter might betide him than they
expected: wherefore laying thervppon some other devises, she proposed unto him
their poverty, and the riches of those that were tendered unto Chloe, likewise
their seruage, by reason of which nothing was their own that could be employed
to his preferment. But (said she) be ruled by me, the girl I know does love
thee, and in respect thereof desires to enjoy thee above any other. Do this
therefore, that shoe acquaint her father with the purpose, and happily being
her own suit, he will the sooner assent unto thee, and require my husband Lamon
for thee. By this excuse Myrtale supposed with herself honestly to have
shifted off Daphnis: for well stood she assured, that Dryas for his part
would never consent unto it: but the simple gote-heard nevertheless took the
deferment in good part, and knowing with him self, that there was no
supposition of treasure to be had to set forward his demand, he did as many
other poor lovers, intend to proceed by entreaty.

For the furtherance hereof, it fortuned, that the Nymphs evermore gracious
unto their joint affections ( Daphnis sleeping at night) appeared unto him, to
whom, being in shape accustomed, the eldest declared, that the patronage of
his love* rested in the perfection of a greater deity than themselves, but to
give him mean to accomplish it, by mollifieng the flintie conceited
disposition of Dryas, that could they do: And it to bring to pass* return
thee to marrow next said she to the place where the last year the boat of the
Methimnians by unloosing the ozia^ twig wherewith it was tied, was lost and
driven to the Sea, there by tempest of the weather shall thou find in the
bank under a bush hard by the same oziar, a bag of three hundred crowns,
which in ouerturning of the same boat, the waves did there drive on land, and
for that it has hitherto lien covered with sand and moss thrown out of the
sea, no man has yet ever found it, take that purse, and give the money to
Dryas, that shall be sufficient for the present to show thou art not utterly
deuoide of riches.

Daphnis awakened out of the dream, longed earnestly for the morning, and the
day appearing, ran in all haste to the sea coast, where serching in the place
appointed, he found the purse and gold therein. Now thinking him self to be
the welthiest man of all the shepheardes, he hied him first to the fields with
his flock, and after debateth the matter to Chloe, and without farther stay
(requiring her to have care of their beasts) he hastneth as fast as he could
to Dryas. Being thither come, he saluteth the man, and afterward sets forth
unto him his occasion of coming. I am said he, Dryas as thou know thy
neighbor, well know I what belongs in every thing to the country, the
ordering of Uines, Olives, and husbandry, is not to me unknowen. How able I am
and with what good success and skill I have guarded my heard, Chloe her self
can witness, and the proof it self will discover. Thy daughter is woed of a
great many, none of which as I, can or may so well deserve her, they profer the
for thy good will, goats, sheep, oxen and corn, as much as will bring the up
three or four chickens. But Dryas, though both for neighborhood and these
causes before alleged, I might seem in this action to be preferred, yet for
that thou shall know that as well as in other qualities I will not be behind
them in gifts, give me my Chloe in marriage, and take here three hundred
crowns for thy labor, which unto Nape here, and thee, I frankly and freely
do render: but with this condition that you both promise me never to be
aknowne of the present, no not to Lamon himself, for whatsoever hereafter that
herein may be supposed.

Dryas and Nape seeing so gross a sum, the like quantity whereof they had
never seen before, being overtaken with the covetousness of the same, gave
their immediate consents without any further denial, and both took upon them
thereunto to draw the good liking of Lamon. All business therefore now laid
aside, and the purse first locked up with the gold, Dryas goes forward to seek
out Lamon and Myrtale, and to them breaks forth the purpose intended. The
seely man with his wife was winowing of corn, and at the first sight began to
complain of their hard peniworths, and the had yielding thereof, all which
(after the manner) Dryas in his blunt and groslike condition recomforted, and
proceeding from out thereof began to demand of them Daphnis for his daughter
in marriage, and added further that albeit of others, he had been therefore
fairly offered, yet of them he demanded nothing, but rather was willing to
contribute of his own to have their consentes, his reason for that they had bin
norished, brought up, lived, and kept beasts together, and that he stood most
assured of, they loved and entirely favored and desired each other. Lamon who
could not for the objections aforesaid excuse himself by poverty, by want of
age of the youth, by difference of education, nor otherwise, and fearing to
disclose the thing it self, which in verity did withdraw him, which was the
doubt and expectation of his parentage, thanked Dryas heartily of his good
suppose, commended the maiden, and praised his courtesy very highly, but yet
answered there withal, that he was a servant to another man, and that living
in servitude as he did, he was not by reason of his bondage to dispose of any
part of his own, without his lords consent. And for so much as to the agreement
of this match, it seemed a thing meet and pertinent to his duty, to have him
thereunto required, he persuaded him they might continue friends, and let the
conclusion of the marriage suspend till the time of the next vintages, which
not being long, his L. he had understanding would then be there in person to
suruiew the state of his house and manner of the country, and then with the
good liking on each part they might be the better solemnized. But heerewithall
Drias (said he) I will of one thing advertise thee, that thou shall not in
matching with him marry thy daughter to one of base birth, or place of mean
calling, but better a great deal descended than either of us both be, and so
giving drink each to other, they upon this resolution for the present departed.

Drias who had not put these last speeches of Lamon into a deaf ear, as his
way lay homewards, reuolued in his mind the state of his Chloe with that of
Daphnis, which by the few speeches that by Lamon had been opposed, he found to
be by likelihood of good place, which made him not a little inwardly to
rejoice that therein was some hope that she should not be much disparaged: in
the consideration whereof, he began to bethink himself whether Lamon finding
him as he did, had therewithal received any such like ornaments to show his
birth as himself had done with Chloe, and tickled with the conceit hereof,
with twenty prayers made to Pan and the Nimphs that it might be so, he came in
these muses to the place at last where rested young Daphnis, together with his
beloved Chloe, to whom having recounted the story hereof, a world of ioies
befell immediately unto the youth, considering that Autumn was now at home, and
the marriage should no longer be deferred, and thanking his supposed father in
law Dryas a thousand times the old man departed.

Now after these shepherds had both dispatched their business, and the sun
ready to go down, they passed homewards, gathering in the ways diverse sorts
of apples, the year was plenty, and fruits were now in their ripeness, among
the number whereof, they chanced to come by one tree, the fruit whereof was all
gathered, and the tree thereby of the leaves left almost naked, only one
apple excepted, the beauty of which was as the color of the shining gold mixed
with an orient red of the freshest and brauest hew that might be, this apple
stood on the very top of the highest branch of all the tree, and for the hight
thereof seemed to be left ungathered: the lovely lad, casting eyes thereupon,
thought that it was a present fit to be given for a love token, and suddenly
getting up to the tree, climed so nimbly that he brought it down in his hand
from the top where it grew.

Chloe became greatly miscontented at his rashness, and fearing to see him
fall, and wound her self from the place among the thickest of her flocks, but
Daphnis pursuing the gentle Nymph, my sweet said he, the fair and beautiful
season has brought forth this fruit, a stately tree has nourished it, the
radiant and most comfortable sun beams have ripened it, and only good
fortune as a thing most choice and perfect, has hitherto reserved it, the
worthiness only apperteining to you as to a creature most excellent. Ill
had I been disposed to suffer so fair a fruit by falling on the hard ground
to have been bruised, foiled, or otherwise trod under feet, or perished. The
apple of gold was erst on Venus bestowed for the prise of her beauty, and that
by a shepherd, and I likewise garding my beasts, have found this apple,
comparable to that in show, wherewith to present my Chloe, who ma^chest her in
favor, In this case am I Paris and thou the self Venus.

The less appaised with these delightsome speeches, assented quickelie with
her Daphnis to be at atonement, and he throwing the apple into her lap, she
only gave him a lovers kiss, wherewith the well pleased goteheard held
himself contented.

In these continued pastances, the often wished and longed for Autumn did now
draw on apace, and a messenger from the master of Lamon was already
approached, to inform them shortly of their lords coming, the brute of
spoil done by the Methimnians on the grounds thereabouts was cause thereof,
and to that end was delivered their master intended to suruiew the harm by
them committed. It was now no need to appoint the old Lamon to his business,
who careful of himself to see all things well, endeavored so to provide that
no one jot might in the least respect be amiss: Daphnis likewise took in
charge neatlie to pick and crimme his herds, and orderly each day to see
them fed on the best and most fruitful pastures, to the intent the heard being
mighty and fat, they might have the more thanks for their travel, and be the
better reputed of at their masters coming. It was unto him a matter of great
novel, to think what manner of man should be his master, so much as the name
of whom till that time he never before had heard.

Lamon for his part began to pass throughout all the hearbers, the vines, the
fruits, and the berries, those boughs he tricked, those knobs he pared,
those branches he slipped, and them in another place cut down and cropped. The
show of this place was a thing of most excellent pleasure, as well of the
situation, prospec^s, plenty and variety of devises, as also for diversity
of trees, and all kinds of fruits. To this had Lamon of all others a most
special regard, wherein his careful in-sight and continual travail had
wrought so great perfection, as seemed to be held a thing rare and
wonderful. The trees hung yet laden with all kind of fruits, plums, apples,
pears, mirtes, granades, oringes, limons, figs, olives, and twenty other
pleasing conceits. Besides the number whereof, the order yet curiosity and
brave disposition of every thing was such, as a man would have thought it a
paradise, a^nd deeply have sorrowed to forethinke that the least spoil in the
world should have happened unto it.

The messenger having seen all things in a readiness prepared, returned to
the City again to advertise his Lord of the estate of the same, who not being
unrewarded of the poor Lamon and Mirtale, they only desired his good word in
setting forth the manner of that he saw, to their greater commendation, the
messenger omitted nothing to him in charge given, but having asserteined what
he came for, waited only the time of his masters readiness.

In this mean while of the return made of the servant to his master, after
all this ^ost bestowed and travail taken of poor Lamon, happened a foul and
cruel mischaunce, the event of which made all the house sorrowful, and them
now only to fear the coming of him thither, whom before they earnestly
looked and most instantly desired, the case standing as it did, upon a
dreadful hazard of their utter undoing, the occasion of all which insued in
form following. There was near thereabouts dwelling to them a cow-heard, a
stubborn and a knurleheaded knave, whose name was Lap^s, who being of Chloe
to-fore time exceedingly enamoured, and seeing that by a conuention between
Dryas and Lamon, he was prevented of his purpose, and hope to obtain her in
marriage, grew thereby into so cruel and presumptuous a conceit of doing unto
him some one or other notable mischief, as that he endeavored nothing so much
as to seek occasion, how, and by what mea^es to be re^enged.

He was well wary that the dependancie of this marriage consisted solie on the
favor and good opinion to be by them received from their master, whereinto if
it were possible, that he could devise by the committing of some o^e or other
notable villainy, to work a breach, twenty to one he thought, that ill must
needs betide them, and the marriage in haud should never be brought in
question. This vilde and mischeuous imagination in some sort to effect, the
villain advised him self of this beautiful plotte, the trimming and decking
whereof had now of long time being attended, brought the same to a most
exceeding perfection, besides the devises thereof being every wai^ (as they
were) most excellent, had made the master of Lamon to be of all things about
his house the most in love with it. Hereuppon as the thing that on all sides
might turn them to most displeasure the cruel and wretched Lapes desired to
be most revenged. Wherefore spyeng a time convenient, one night when all about
the house were universally at rest: this false and villainous churl, woond
himself secretly into the garden, and there moiled and spoiled, with hooks,
with hatchets, and other cutting instruments, the most part of the hedgerows,
vines, fruits, and trees of all the hearberie and garden * which being done
he returned himself secretly again, without being perceived of any man.

Lamon, the next morning early, entering into his gardeine with intent to surue
we and trick what he might in the least iott see thereabout amiss, perceived
the spoil and notable misusance every where done unto it, and not knowing
from whence it came, but moved exceedingly with the dispight and villainy
thereof, as the only thing of all others that his master loved, looked for no
other relief at all, but to be beaten to death or hanged. Wherefore overcome
as he was with great grief, he tare his garment from his shoulders, and
thereupon skritched and cried most lamentably.

Myrtale hearing the clamor, left what was in her hand, and ran in all haste
unto him. Daph^is also which even then had but led his beasts to the field,
moved with great lamentation, returned back again unto them. And seeing this
great disgrace most vile and detestable havoc and wrack done and committed
on all parts of the hearberie, it could not but greatly become unto them a
matter most sorrowefull, for to say the truth, were a man thereunto but a
mere stranger, he could not but have deeply grieved to see the malicious
and caussesse spoil of so fair and pleasant a dwelling, the parts yet
untouched whereof, for all the disorder therein committed, carried
notwithstanding some manner demonstration of the beauty of the other. The
greuousnes of the sight made them al to shed tears abundant, for their undoing
stood upon it, Lamon one while for hym-selfe, and an other while for Daphnis
exceedingly weeped. During the continuance of which discomforte, Eudrome the
page and messenger, that before had been with them, from their Master was
returned again, declaring, that after three days passed, their old Master
intended to be there present, but their young Master his son would come
thither the morrow.

Preparation heere-vppon ensued on all sides, and now the monstrousness of
the evil done did trouble them more and more. But Eudrome being of his
own disposition, a youth of very good nature, they devised amongst
themselves for to call him also to council about this enterprise. The case
being made known unto him, Eudrome seeing their excessive sorrow and moan
made, recomforted them, and advised as most meet, that the matter were first
made known unto their young Master, whom he assured unto them to be of
loving and most kind condition, and that upon their submission made, he
would not stick so far forth to pity them, as that by his good and
favorable conceit, some one thing or other for redress might there be the
better provided.

Lamon not withstanding was not yet idle, but slipped and cropped the hanging
boughs and twigges round about the garden, he did what he could by all
the art and cunning he had, to make the havoc seem less, insomuch as by
his diligent looking too, and attendaunce, he had reasonably amended the
matter in diverse places. Their yo^ng Master according unto appointment came
the next day, whose name was Astile, and with him brought to accompany him for
his disporte, a parasiticall gester, whose name was Gnatho. The gentleman was
yet very young, upon whose chinne the tender down had scarcely crept, and
therewithal of most gentle and friendly condition: be was no sooner entered
the grounds, but Lamon and Myrtale his wife together with young Daphnis fell
prostrat at his feet, desiring his favor and forgiveness, and that being
campassionate upon the old years of his bondsman, he would endeavor so
far as he might, to withdraw his fathers rage and displeasure from them.

Astile rewed the miserable complaint, and the better to relieve them, out of
their woonted distresses and sorrows, he promised, that at his fathers
coming, he would endeavor to make some prea^ye excuse of the matter, and for
to take the cauie and choice occasion thereof wholly upon himself. They
thankefully heere-vppon took his agreement, and endeavoring by all the means
possible to cont^nt him, both Lamon and Daphnis, with diverse notable presents
did afterward entertain him, they prayed God also in respect of their
disabilitie, that it would please him of his goodness to requi^e him.

Now Gnatho this parasite being a right belli-god, a villain by nature, and
one that loved none, but where he might be fed, nor cared for any, but
only for his profit, seeing the sweet and natural favor of this young
Daphnis, began as an unnatural beast, so against nature become wanton over
him. The paunch-filled rascal, seeing that Astile was a brave young gentleman,
took pleasure in hunting, and to haunt the fields abroad with his hawks and
spaniels, devised from time to time sundry shifts, whereby to rid himself of
his company. And in these spaces would he haunt the herds of young Daphnis, and
one while hearing him sound his flute, and another while sing, thought there was
no felicity in the world so great, as to be accompanied with his pleasure. The
wretch moving to the goat-heard many questions, and perceiving his simplicity
and unacquainted disposition to villainous purposes, one time by watching his
goings and co^mings would have found means in forcible manner to abuse him. But
the in^inuat condition by nature and his former birth, planted in the imbold^ed
spirits of the young youth, with a manner of sweltring kind of disdain* shook
the rascal off, and that so tudelie, as his pampered drunken carcas squatted
against the ground with the pezant and unwieldy burden thereof.

The parasiticall tricker perceiving the vnmollified spirit of the brave
goatheard, and weieng there withal the manner of his unexpected color and
courage, such as seldom falls in those that by nature are borne to be
slaves, thought that in his nativity the stars and planets were unto him too
sinister, in that unto a mind and favor so correspondent, they yielded an
estate and condition so mightily different. Nevertheless though in so
forcible manner he dared no more to affaie the youth, yet for all that withdrew
he not from him his sensual and beastly disposition, but considering that the
lad was but the son of Lamon reputed, and therefore thought as a (...) to
belong unto his lord, he deemed with himself to practice another devise more
colorable, whereby when time should serve, he might the easter attain^ to that
his wretched and most abominable desire.

This could he not immediately bring to pass, for that the old man with his
wife, children and family were now all arrived at this his country dwelling.
In the first two days after whose arrival, there was nothing but feasting and
banketting, Dionysophanes was the old man's name, and Clearista his wife. After
then that he had rep^sed himself by the space of two days, he then began to
visit his herberies, his gardens, walks, and other (...) and pleasant devises,
in all which he found no fault at all, save only the spoil which before you
heard of, which young Astile had ere this to him execused and taken the matter
upon himself, where with Dionysophanes held himself contented. Then walked he
forwards to see the herds and flocks, at the sight of which company of so
many strangers, Chloe ^ashfull on a sudden, and being in the fields, as she
that had never bin accustomed to their view, stole away secretly, and hid her
self in the (...), but Daphnis stood still awaiting their coming. Lamon then
pointing out unto his master his goats and sheep that so daintilie had been
fe^ and increased, added further unto him, that the youth standing by was his
goate-heard, who by his dilligent care and attendaunce had thither to conducted
them.

Dionysophanes and Clearista beholding the excellent favor and sweet gestures
of the youth, who furnished in every condition as a heardseman, and having a
fair large skin of a he goat, smoothelie dressed with the hair fastened
unto his neck, and hanging over his shoulders, thought that there appeared in
him a kind of beauty, more commendable far, than customably was to be
seen in every other sheepeheard. Daphnis began to make unto them music
upon his flute, and with diverse and excellent lays and ditties of the
sheepeards ^o entertain them, all which of the company Generallye, but
Clearista especially, was in him both rewarded, liked, and highly commended,
besides commanded she him, and likewise Dionysophanes his Master expres^y
enioyne^ him, not to be absent from the house during their abode and
continuance in the country, but always there to attend them.

All this unto the vile and beastly conceit of Gnatho, di^de but add fire
unto the flame, who being wholly dedicated unto luxury and his belly, was
not able to contain himself within l^mits, but takes Astile on a time a tone
side, and thus c^utelously, the better to accomplish his purpose delivers
unto him. I have (Sir) heere-tofore never in my life yielded appetite or liking
to any thing so much, as to quaffing company, and abundance of feeding, but
now is my mind changed there-fro, and since I saw this fresh young
goate-heard playing on his pipe so melodiously as he does, me thinks than
the sole and sweet pleasure thereof, there is no delight in the world. Now
Sir, albeit he be the son of your fathers villain, yet surely respecting
the seemly favors he bears: for estraunged in show from so simple a
proportion, me thinks you might do very well to crave him of your father,
and to take him from these herds to dwell with you at home in the city.
Astile harkened hereunto, and thought it not amiss, and only attended, but
time convenient to move his father thereof. This speech by Eudrome the page,
being ouer-heard, who knew the (...) delights of this parasite ges^er, and
marked since their coming thither this continual fawning and pursuit of the
gentle Daphnis, and how many exercises there withal he tendered, that he
would procure his freedom, thought this fair weather was not all for naught,
and therefore speeding himself to Lamon and Myrtale (as one compassionate of
the youths misfortune, if the way in question should be taken) he revealed
unto them both the practice, and also what of the event thereof, not without
good cause he had coniectured.

The poor old man surcharged now, with far greater griefs than ever
before he was pestred, for that the loss of his life could not have been
more miserable unto him than the sorrow of this mischief, saw that the
disguise of this youth in sending his son, should^ now without speedy
prevention, become mea^e to make him the beastly pray and spoil (under pretext
of bringing him to the service of Astile) to a base, vile, ser^ile, and
gorbellied drunkard. This thought the poor man, rather to die than to suffer:
wherefore resolving himself to reveal (if need compelled) what he was, that
the worthiness of his birth might the sooner free him from such intolerable
seruage, he only (...) but for the opportunity when Astile should beg him
of his father, which being by the continual suggestion of Gna^o the ^ext day
put in practice. The simple bondsman standing forth, fell prostrate immediately
at his lords feet, and embracing straightly his knees besought him to have
compassion of his humble suit and petition then to be made unto him.
Dionysophanes willed him to speak* and then taking Daphnis by the hand.
Clearista present, and the most part else of the family, Lamon thereupon said:
I am not (sir) discontented, that it is your good pleasure, and my young L.
Astile here, to take from me this young youth out of these country labors,
to attend, and there to remain with him in the city, for so might it thereby
happen, that a worthy and noble Master, might also enjoy of him by this
means, a free and noble servant, but that by pretext thereof, and under
color to draw him hence to an other place, whereby in most vile and
insufferable manner to abuse the worthiness of his shape against nature,
only by notice, that he is the son of a bondslaue, and bred of my loins,
and that namely also to bec^me a vessel to hi^ (...), eue^ the gross villainy
of this parasiticall gester: this Gnatho here present, who upon a beastly and
(...) conceit to accomplish the same, has only suggested this motion, that
can I never suffer. Wherefore (Sir) that the better it may appe^re unto your
knowledge, how unfit it is, that so great and not co^monlye accustomed feature
and comeliness, should in so vile and bad manner be misprized: understand I
beseech you, that this young and brave youth here present is not my son (as
it has been supposed) nor is the baseness of our condition able to produce
so excellent a creature: but being now^ eighteen years since I found him
laid forth in pastures ^enderly (...) within a small thicket, whereunto o^e
of my (...), to my great astonishement ordinarily resorted to su^ke it, neither
am I able to say how, or by whose hands it came there* but this know I, that
the descent thereof can not be mean, resp^cting the costly attire, (...), and
(...) which I found about it, all which I have hithe^ to whol^ and e^tirely
preserved, by the conjecture whereof you may the better d^eme of his parentage,
and how (...) it is, that so gentle (...) nature should become the subject
and spoil of so base and serui^e (...) condition.

Lamon had (...) scarce shut his lips upon these speeches, but that Gnatho
enraged at these his sharp peercing ^auntes and inforcements used against him,
closed straight ways with his words, and threatened, that ere long he would
for this be thoroughly revenged on him. Dionysophanes for his pa^te was amazed
at the accident, and charging his bondsman, in (...) vehement and hard speeches
thereof to deliue^ (...) truth. L^mon* further added, and swore by the
immortal gods, by Pan, and the Nymphs, that herein he had ^ot lied one word,
and to the end to make clear the matter, caused his wife Myrtale to bring
forth the attire, the mantle, and iewelles, and there showed them in his
presence.

Dionysophanes having heard these last speeches of Lamon together with his
attentive countenance and ^arnest protestation, looked upon G^atho with an
aspect austere and grimme, as one love with thy brother indifferently. And in
the parting of my possessions between you, I will that this house, these
lands, the moouables here in my herds, flocks, servants, and all things else
thereunto belonging, do remain and continue unto thee. Daphnis at the
repetition of these last words, not suffering his father to speak forth the
rest, start up quickly on a sudden, and there with O Nymphs, said he, my
herds have not all this while been watered, and I stand here still a doing
nothing. The company heereat fell a laughing, to see that the remembrance of
that wherein so long he had been trained, could not yet make him forget what
he had to do when he was wont to be a servant. But they advertised unto him
that the care of his gotes belonged now unto another, and that he needed not to
troble his thonghts therewith any longer. Chloe all this while being filled with
the* brute of Daphnis and his new acknowledgement of his parents, did nothing
else but grieve and lament to see the bad success (as she deemed) of their
loves, for thinking that Daphnis being now advanced to rich parentage, would
not any more regard or account of her, he could but sigh and wail, accusing
her self to have given more confidence to his othsworne by his gotes than to
that he had made before to the Nymphs. Lapes therefore, who for dispite and
wreak of the love of Daphnis then made to her, had spoiled in the night time,
and marred the workmanship of Lamon as you heard before, perceiving now that
the state of Daphnis might tend to other effect, began to devise to steal the
shepherdess by force, and for that purpose accompanied with a number of r^de
rakell fellows, encountered with her one morning as she was drining her ^ocks,
and offering violence unto her she skritched alowd* the sound of her voice
came first to Nape, and after to Drias and from him to Daphnis: but the yoonge
goteheard conferring n^we the state and reputation of his friends, durst not be
acknowne publikelie of the action, but called forth some of the house, to whom
he gave special direction to aid and assist Dryas.

Gnatho, who had ever since his villenie discovered, hid himself from all
company, having notice of the direction, thought with himself that now was
the time wherein occasion was offered him to be reconciled to Daphnis, and
putting himself forth in the prease, as he that intended to be a guide unto
them in that action, they encountered Lapes by their have, and the residue of
his clownes that now were even ready to have conveyed away the Nymph, and
buckling heerevpon togithers, with hard strokes on either sides, Dryas and his
company in the end had the best, and rescuing Chloe again lambs kind the rude
lobkins welfauoredlie.

Gnatho supposing that he had behaved himself reasonable manly in this
enterprise, challenged the honor of the conquest into his hands, whereof he now
thought to make a grateful present unto his young master Dryas, was not
therewith miscontented, but accompanied them both to Daphnis, where being come,
Gnatho made offer of the brave Nymph into his hands, humbly submitting
himself therewithal at his feet, and prayed him of pardon for his
misd^meanors passed, and that he might again be restored by his means to the
former enterteinment that in his fathers house he woontedlie received.

Daphnis gladded inwardly at the sight of his Chloe, accepted his service, and
embracing her many times, he was in mind to have committed her again to
Dryas, with great desire that their loves might be kept secret. But Dryas
utterly denied that, but rather deliberating to make the matter plain, seeing
the other was already by fortune made known to his parents, took Chloe
again for that instant, and the next morning leading her with him to the house
of Dionysophanes, and desiring at the hands of him and his wife a little
attentive hearing, he made known unto them the finding of Chloe, her
education, her putting to the charge of keeping of flocks in the pastures, the
vision to him and Lamon appearing touching the disposition of their
fosterlings, Daphnis putting also to the feeld, the mutual society of him and
Chloe there begun, continued and concluded upon after in marriage, and
therewithal prayed that the Nymph by change and alteration of the state of
Daphnis might not now be despised: and to the intent that they might the beeter
stand assured of her parentage, he showed also the call, mantle, slippers and
other attire and jewels that he found with her: and those with her, recommended
e^tsoones to their patronage, love, care, and common defense.

Dionysophanes and Clearista beholding the beautiful and seemly parts of the
shepherdess, and weieng also, that by like ensigns and badges as theirs, she
had been laid forth, concluded the likelihood thereof with their own
intendments, and the rather in respect of those testimonies which showed in
some sort, the reckoning of her parents, and as king also of Daphnis his
willingness therein, they accepted her immediately as their daughter in law,
and confirmed the liking, wherewith before he had received her as his wife.

Time wearing out the period of every determinat purpose and resolution, made
Dionysophanes and his wife to think themselves sufficiently by this time
recreated with the pleasure of the count^ie: wherefore apparelling Chsoe after
the manner of the city, and as beseemed their daughter, they jointly with all
their whole household removed, and came back again to Meteline, but first in
recompense of the painful travel of both these aged heardsmen, Dionysophanes
rewarded Lamon with his freedom, and besides gane him afterward wherewith to
live richly: to Dryas also of his bounty he gave three hundred crowns more
than those he had before, and a gown furred, and other apparel both for
winter and summer. To Nape, and e^peciallie to Myrtale Clearista was not
unthankful, both she and Lamon, besides greatly reioicing in their old age
to have obtained their f^eedome.

Now grew there to be a wonder at their arrival in Metelene upon this strange
kind of accident, by means of which, diverse of the woorthiest of the city
and their wives visited Dionysophanes to know the manner and truth of the same:
among all the rest that were there to participat this novel, one Megacles a
wealthy noble citizen, hearing the recount of the ^ding and knowledge of
Daphnis made by Dionysophan^* sighing deeply in his mind, began at a sudden to
weep very tenderly, and being earnestly of the assistants demanded the
occasion thereof, he said: It is now about sixteen years since, that by reason
of my great charge bestowed in travel, and sundry losses happened unto me by
seas, I had then a daughter borne unto me by my wife Rhode, and for so much as my
estate was at that instaut so weak, as made me in great hazard how I might
recover my losses and fortune again, and yielded me also some despair how, or
by what means I might afterward live having so many children: in great
agony of mind I took the infant and gave it in like manner as thou
Dionysophanes to one of my servants, with apparel, iewelles, and other things
about it, and willed him, in some convenient place to bestow the same,
recommending it thereby to the protection and guidance of some better hap. My
children then had, are since all of them dead, my wealth nevertheless not any
ways diminished, but rather increased, but ah my greatest unkindness to that
infant, has now bereft me of any child at all, and there is none to inherit
the possessions and goods I leave behind me. The recordation hereof (
Dionysophanes) reported by a new relation and delivery of thy good hap in
recovering thy son, together with the manner of thy departing from him so
justly agreeing in every thing with mine, makes me only in this to accuse my
ill hap, that can not also in the self occasion attain the event and fortune
of other men, and lamenting the untimely miscarryeng of her (whom then I
deemed some one or other being without child might happily find, and take
to their guidance, but now do expect utterly to be destroyed) do wish to
continue for her sake the residue of my life in perpetual sorrow and heaviness.

This pitiful discourse of the old Megacles, bredde in the mind of all the
company an extreme sadness, wherefore, as well on a sudden to alter the
dombe conceit thereof, as otherwise to manifest unto them all, a double occasion
of his gladness: this aged Dionysophanes first brought forth to Megacles the
ornaments found with Chloe (hir-selfe hitherto remaining unspoken of, and
unseen, but altogether in secret) and thereof demanded of Megacles if he had
any knowledge, affirming, that in the recovery of his son, such manner of
things also came to his hands. But Megacles well knowing and remembering the
tokens of the same, fell hereby into a greater extremity than before,
thinking, that he by this might well be assured, that his daughter could not
now otherwise choose but be dead, and that some heardsman of the field had by
chance taken up these things, and brought them also to Dionysophanes together
with Daphnis. Dionysophanes seeing hereby, that it was not requisite unto the
intendment of a ioifull mee^ing long time in this sort to dally, began then
with sweet words to comfort this Megacles, and assured him, that his daughter
was living, and therewith presenting unto the view of all the company, the
mere divine and exquisite proportion indeed of very Beauty it self,
harbored in the amiable looks of this fair and excellent Chloe, he made
known also to their hearing the whole manner of her continuance even to her
present finding.

Megacles not sufficiently able upon a sudden to digest his joys, straightly
embraced the Nymph, and being also informed of the marriage intended to the
celebrated between her and Daphnis, desired no better aliance. And in sign
how well and worthily he deemed of the match, he freely there gave and bestowed
upon her, to her present advancement, the inheritance of al his lands, wealth,
and possessions whatsoever, only reserved unto those that so charily had unto
that estate conducted her, such liberal rewards and presents, as to the
reputation of his person, and the benefit at that instant received, might seem
most agreeing and correspondent.

The citizens all thereabouts, commending highly the rare and wonderful
accomplishments of these two noble creatures, extolled the indifferency of the
match, and prayed Himenaeus to give unto them, a happy, fruitful, and
gladsome continuance: whereby were finished in most honorable, and sumptuous
manner, to the rejoicing of all the beholders, the final determination of all
these pastoral amors.

FINIS.
