BY HIS MAJESTY'S Counseil for Virginia.
A BRIEF DECLARATION OF the present state of things in Virginia, and of a
Division to be now made, of some part of those Lands in our actual possession,
as well to all such as have adventured their monyes, as also to those that are
Planters there.
WHen first it pleased GOD to move his MAJESTY'S mind, at the humble suit of
sundry his loving Subjects, to yield unto them his gracious Privilege for the
Virginia Plantation, it was a thing seeming strange and doubtful in the eye of
the World, that such and so few Vnder-takers should enterprise a charge of that
weight, as rather beseemed a whole State and Commonwealth to take in hand. But
such was the success of their sundry attempts, in the happy discovery of so
goodly a Land, the Description of which, for the excellency of the Climate and
fertility thereof, had soon obtained to lay such an assured ground of future
hope, in the sense and understanding of all men rightly weighing it, that not
long after, the^r new Letters Patents, with more ample privileges granted by
his Majesty, were almost filled with many hundred Names, both Honorable, and
others of all sorts, that gave their hands and consent to further and uphold
that honorable action.

Upon which encouragement of so many worthy Patrons, the Company very deeply
engaged themselves, in sending Men and Ships, Cattle, and all kind of
provisions, with Governors and Captains for peace and war, insomuch as no
earthly means seemed then wanting for the speedy reducing of that barbarous
Nation, and savage people, to a quiet Christian Commonwealth.

But such was the will of Almighty God, as the world well knows, that this
great hope and preparation, by many disasters on Sea and Land, too long to be
here recited, was in a manner clean defeated, and there only remained a poor
remnant of those Men and Women, Cattle and provisions, that escaped the danger
and which are now remaining there to raise and build up that intended Colonie.

Which when those Gentlemen th'aduenturers here saw, and that the expectance of
so great a preparation brought nothing home but adverse success and bad
reports, they for the most part withdrew themselves, in despair of the
enterprise, and so gave it over, not enduring to repair the ruins, nor to
supply what themselves had underwritten, to discharge the deep engagement,
whereinto the Company was drawn by their encouragement.

By whose inconstancy and irresolution, the hope of that Plantation, together
with the lives of our people there, had then utterly perished, had not Gods
secret purpose been more strongly fixed to uphold the same, by stirring up the
minds and undaunted spirits of a very small remnant of constant Adventurers,
that with Sir Thomas Smith (their Treasurer and Governor from the beginning)
in all that time of three years disaster, were never discouraged, nor withdrew
themselves from weekly Courts and meetings, yielding their purses, credit and
counseil, from time to time, to make new supplies, even beyond their
proportion, to uphold the Plantation.

Insomuch as by the favorable assistance of God, who in his own wisdom does
oftentimes effect the greatest ends by weakest means, it is now come to pass,
that our English Colonie there, subsisteth in a very good and prosperous
condition: They sow and reap their Corn in sufficient proportion, without
want or impeachment; their Kine multiply already to some hundreds, their Swine
to many thousands, their Goats and Poultry in great numbers, every man has
house and ground to his own use, and now being able to maintain themselves
with food, they are also prepared and ready, once having the means, to set
upon the Minerals, whereof there are many sorts; as also to plant and sow such
several kinds of Seeds and Fruits, as may best befit the Soil and Climate,
to make the Land profitable to themselves and th'Aduenturers.

This being a true Relation of the present state and hope of things in
VIRGINIA, we thought good in this short manner to mention it by the way, as
well to give those worthy Governors in VIRGINIA their deserved praise, for the
unspeakable pains and hazard which they have endured there, in framing the
people and Plantation to so happy a form, as also to withdraw the despayring
thoughts of such old retired Adventurers, that make no other reckoning, but
whatsoever has been spent upon the name of VIRGINIA to be lost and cast away;
the special purpose of this our Publication, being to another end, which for
the further satisfying of all reasonable minded, we will now in few words
deliver.

It was published to the world, about seven years since, and the time is now
expired, wherein we promised to cause a Diuident to be made of the Lands in
Virginia, as well to every man's person that went himself to the Plantation, as
to every particular man that had adventured his money.

And in as much as we are now by the Natives liking and consent, in actual
possession of a great part of the Country, the other part not as yet freed from
encomber of woods and trees, nor thoroughly suruayed, whereby to make a Diuident
of the whole: yet of that part which is now fit for Plantation, we intend God
willing to begin a present Division by Lot to every man that has already
adventured his money or person, for every single share of twelve pound ten
shillings, fifty Acres of Land, till further opportunity will afford to divide
the rest, which we doubt not will bring at least two hundred Acres to every
single share.

This Division is intended to be done by a new Governor with Commissioners and
Surveyers to be sent from hence to join with others that are there already, to
give every man his Lot in due proportion, according to such indifferent
Directions as shall be given them in charge.

And forasmuch as this course of sending a Governor with Commissioners and a
Suruayor, with Men, Ships, and sundry provisions, for fortifications and other
occasions, as all men may conceive, cannot be effected without great charge
and expense to the Company; it is therefore thought requisite, and determined,
that so many Adventurers as will partake of this first Diuident, shall present
their Names, with their number of shares, into a Book remaining at Sir Thomas
Smiths for that purpose, before the 25. of June next.

And they shall also promise under their hands, to contribute to the said
charge, the sum of twelve pound ten shillings, to be paid within one Month
after Subscription, whether his shares be more or less, except any man shall
be pleased to adventure more, and for which twelve pound ten shillings (or more
if he will) he shall also have a further Diuident of land in proportion, as
for all other his moneys formerly adventured. But for such as are not able to
lay down present money, if they shall desire favor, it is agreed for them,
that the Treasurer may receive the one half of their said adventure in present
money, after their vnderwriting, to furnish out the ships, and the other half
at six Months after that.

And that no man may hereafter excuse himself by ignorance, nor tax the
Company for concealing their purpose, we declare to all men, that this present
Division is to be only in the Lands lying along the Kings River on both sides,
and all about the new Towns erected; in which so many as shall give in their
names as aforesaid, may have their parts, and those that will not, may at their
pleasure forbear till hereafter, to take their Lot upon the same terms in
places more remote.

The Names of all such as will partake of this Diuident, shall be given in
writing to the Commissioners before they go hence, at whose return they shall
bring with them a perfect Map and Description of the said lands and ground
divided, that every man may see and know in what condition and where his land
lies, that accordingly he may dispose thereof at his pleasure, either by going
himself in person to possess it, or by sending families to manure it for
yearly rent, or for half the clear profits as many others do.

And furthermore, every man's portion allotted to him, shall be confirmed as
state of inheritance to him and his heirs for ever, with bounds and limits
under the Companies Seal, to be holden of his Majesty, as of his Manor of
East Greenwich, in Socage Tenure, and not in Capite, according to his Majesty's
gracious Letters Patents already granted to the VIRGINIA Company in that
behalf.

And notwithstanding, as we hope, the chief brunt and doubt of that Plantation
is now ouerpast, whereof to their great charge and hazard the old Adventurers
have endured the most difficult part, and might therefore justly appropriate
this present Diuident to themselves, yet at the motion and desire of many
Gentlemen and others, intending to be new adventurers, it is resolved and
granted by the Company, that all new Adventurers, subscribing and performing
the conditions before mentioned, for twelve pound ten shillings, or more,
shall partake in proportion as freely in this present Diuident, and in any
other privilege and freedom in VIRGINIA, as if with the old Adventurers they
had been partakers from the beginning. (*)

FINIS.
