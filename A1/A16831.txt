TO THE RIGHT HONble, ROBERT GREVILL, Lord BROOK of BEAVCHAMP-COVRT, Grace,
and Peace.
RIGHT HONORABLE,
YOur Goodness as the timely Spring, sprouting forth into the buds, and
blossoms of pious resolutions, and so Honorably at^ended, is as a City set
on a hill, which cannot be hid. But promises a far off, unto all honest
passengers to be a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the Tempest:
Isa. 32.2.

Wherefore this ensuing Treatise having now received its birth, and being; and
as a Pilgrim, being to pass abroad into the world, to seek entertainment;
does conceive hope of safety under your shadow, and of good acceptance in the
Church, and among others of the household Faith, and heirs of Promise, through
your favorable acceptance. And therefore I have made bold humly to present it
unto your Honorable protection, and noble admission, to do your self its
first service; that from this hill of SION, unto the valleys of the same; the
streams thereof running down, as a river of still waters, may refresh, and make
glad the City of GOD.

Which preasent, as it is mine, can promise no more unto your Lordship, than
could the Carkeis, of a dead Lion unto SAMPSON or than JEREMIAH his girdle,
which was profitable for nothing: (Iere. 13.7.) And therefore, as a thing
undesired, to be buried out of your sight. Yet if you shall vouchsafe to way
the contents, and the matter whereof it consists, you may be moved to think
the same meet to attend your most retired pres^nce.

But not to detain your Lordship in the gate; because of wisdoms voice:
(Prou. 8.1.) Which is as the noise of many waters: (Reu 1.15.) Crying from
within and saying. Eat O friends; drink; yea drink abundantly, O beloved.
(Cant. 5.10.) Yea come, buy Wine, and milk, without money, and without price:
(Isa. 55.1) Therefore humbly taking my leave, and leving your Lordship a^ this
feast of fat things, which the Lord of hosts has made unto all people (I^a.
25.6.) there well to fare. And with my unfeigned, and fervent desire, and prayer
unto God, for a daily grouth, and increase of all grace in your Lordship so
happily begun, I do rest, and shall for ever remain.

Your Lordships, most humbly devoted* F. B.

TO THE READER.
THough the Lord in Heaven, of his infinite goodness, and mercy has left unto
us his poor people on earth, his holy and blessed word, to be a light to our
feet, and a Lantern to our paths, which is able to make us wise to Salvation,
and absolute to every good work, to guide us well and safely through this
dangerous world, and to bring us home to himself at the last in peace: And
has given us charge to search the Scriptures, as they that testify of Ch^rist
Jesus, and in which we look to have Eternal life, and that it should dwell
plenteously in us in all wisdom, and has given unto us in this Land
peaceable, and happy times affording us leave, and opportunity to exercise our
selves in the same, yet such is the extreme folly, and sinfulness of the
heart of man, that the most part of people cumber themselves about many things;
profits, pleasures lusts, or any thing, and neglect that one thing that is
necessary, few choosing the good part, that never shall be taken from them that
have it, but spend their time, and strength of affection upon fading vanities,
that will leave them without comfort in their greatest need; having a price in
their hand to get wisdom (which is far beter than all pearls) but have no
heart, nor do understand the things that belong to their peace, in this day of
their visitation. Wherefore as the Lord may take up the l^ke complaint against
us, as he did against his Israel long ago: (Hos. 8.12.) That he had written
unto them the great things of his Law, but they had counted them a strange
thing: so may he also have a Controversy against us, as against them: (Hos.
4.1.2.) For that there is no mercy, nor truth, nor knowledge of God in the
Land, for the generality being too true with us. And therefore he may justly
take away the Gospel of the Kingdom from us, and give it to the^ that will
more highly esteem it, make better use, and bring forth more fruit of the
same: (Math. 27.43) And send us a Famine ^ot of bread, and thirst of water, but
of that bread of life, the good word of God, that Spiritual Manna, so much
loathed or at least so little regarded: (Amos, 8.11.12.) Yet as our gracious
and good God forbeareth this sinful, and unthankful Nation, with admirable
and unspeakable patience beyond expectation, so cease he not by many means
to bring us to a greater care and Conscience of our duty in this behalf of
exercising our selves (I mean) in his most blessed and good word; partly
sending us of later years, many Afflictians, and Crosses, and daily threatening
more, that finding trouble and sorrow in the world, we might be glad to seek
Comfort in God, and in his blessed word. He calls on us also heereto by the
daily Ministry of his Servants the Prophets, together with their holy books
and writings. And that no means might be left untried to do us good, or leave
us without excuse, lo here to you which are the people of God, how he has
raised up one from among your selves, of the common order of men (a private
Christian I mean) for your Conviction, for your Instruction. To convince you
how much wisdom and understanding may be obtained even of private persons, by
a constant, and painful Reading of the Scriptures, joined with a diligent
attendance on the public ministry of the word: as may well appear by this
worthy work that this Author presents unto you: whereby the humble, and
wellminded Readers may be whetted on to the like diligence in the Scriptures,
which here they shall see, and that not without hope of attaining that which
may be worthy of Iheir pains, that so they may become wise and vndtrstanding
Christians. For want of which, it proves a great fault even among the better
sort of people, that they hold the points of their Religion from the mouth of
their Ministers, and not from the voice of God in the Scriptures, and so build,
as if but a Fox run upon it he shall break down their stony wall. If one
of like parts, and place shall teach the contrary they will be shaken and
ready to be removed especially if he be backed with Authority: whereas if
every Truth he holds in Religion, he had it well grounded on a plain
testimony of Scripture, two or three, he should not be moved with every wind
of contrary Doctrine, but stand firm, and immovable as Mount Zion, and having
withal the love of the Truth in his heart, all the men, and means in the
world could, nor should not remove him from his steadfastness, which is the
honor of a Christian endeed.

And this wisdom, skill and ab^l^ty, every man may see by this his work, to
be in the Author of this Book, who has brought forth so innumerable places
of Scripture for his several purposes, with that soundness of Judgment,
singular dexterity, and great understanding, as is not to be expected from a
private Christian. But he having been a daily hearer of the word, and that
from Zealous and fruitful Teachers, having made use also of the same with
great d^l^gence, and constancy in his Fam^ly; and besides these, spent very
much time in private reading and study, he has obtained a great degree in the
Faith, and is higher by head and shoulders, (as it is said of SAVL) than the
rest of his own rank.

For I count that Interpretation and giving the sense of Scriptures as it is a
d^fficult, so a peculiar work to the Ministers of God (ordinarily) and not to
be adventured upon by Chr^st^ans in their Families, or private meetings, any
further than they have good bottom from that which they have learned by the
Ministry of the Word, nor to write such Books as this, wherein is occasion of
the use of so much Scripture, least there should be found many mistakings
therein, which were both sinful and dangerous, and yet most likely. But God
has very mercifully guided this Author, in this his work, which may, and I
hope will be of much fruitful and good use in (...) the Church of God: For as
it may help any ordinary Christian, yea or Minister with more parallel places,
than may be he would have at hand of himself, so it will help well to the
understanding of many places of Scriptures, seeing here, in what sense, and to
what purposes they are brought and applied. The pains has been very great no
doubt to one man, but if the Benefit may be much, and good to many, and so God
be glorified, the Author no doubt, will think his labor happily bestowed, and
abundantly rewarded, which is my great desire, and humble and earnest prayer
also, who is the true, though weak, and unworthy Servant of the Church of God,

JOHN ROGERS.

CHRISTIAN READER.
IN the perusal of this Treatise thou shall find that the Author threof has
taken very great pains, and that which is more, great pains to good purpose.
Great pains are but a small Commendation where they prove not beneficial to a
common good. There are not wanting in the world that take pains more than
enough in the Composing, and writing of some Books, of which when they have
done, it may be truly said as of IEREMIES Girdle; That they are Good for
nothing. (Ier. 13 7.) The curious trifles of many ill employed wits want
happily for no pains, but consider whether such persons may not in another
sense take up SALOMONS words: (Eccles 2, 11) I looked on all the works that
mine hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and
behold, all was vanity, and there was no profit. The Non cernis quod propterea
animalium gloriosissima est ap^s, non quia laborat, ^ed quia alijs la^orat.
Etiam aranca laborat and fatigatur, and tenues per panetes extendit textur as
omnem mulieris sapientiam excedentes, sed est ignobile animal, quia opus ejus
est nulla enus v^^^^. ^ ales (...) libi laborantes and se defatigantes.
Chrysostom. ad Pop. Antioch. Hom. 12.
Spider is industrious in her kind, and takes pains in making of her Web, as
well as the Be in making of her Honey, and Combs. And yet who respects the
Spiders web, as the Bees work? The profit that comes of the labor of the Be,
is it that makes her labor to be in more esteem than the Spiders. Now in this
Treatise thou shall find the Author to have been a diligent Industrious Be,
that has brought a great deal of profitable sweet Honey to this his hiue; it
being a Treasury and Collection out of the Word of GODS Promises which are
sweeter than the Honey, and the honey Comb.

Thou shall in this Authors Industry see how much is to be gotten by the
diligent and observant reading of the Scriptures. I wish with all mine heart
that his Industry may prove exemplary; and that many may hereby be provoked to
the like religious diligence in acquainting themselves with the word. It was
good counsel that a godly old man gave In vita Musculi apud Melch. Ad. p^. 370.
MVSCVLVS when he first began to Preach. That Si bonus velit fieri Concionator
det operam vt sit bonus Biblicus, That if ever he would prove a good Preacher,
he must take pains to be well acquainted with the Bible. And it were to be
wished that all Preachers would follow that counsel. Preaching would prove the
more solid, savourie, and successful. But I will go further than that old
man; and I say, Si bonus velis fieri Christianus, des operam v^ sis bonus
Biblicus. If thou will prove a good Christian, thou must be well skilled in the
Holy Bible. How happy were it if the Scriptures were more carefully read then
they are! It is said of Nunquam Cyprianus absque Tertulliani lectione vnum diem
praeterijt and crebro dicere solirus. Da Magistrum Tertullianum significans.
CYPRIAN, that he let no day pass without reading TERTVLLIAN, and was wont
often to say, Give me my Master, meaning TERTVLLIAN. Such diligence in reading
the Scriptures would do well; Especially, they being GODS own Epistle, and
letter from Heaven unto us that we should know his mind. And if Princes letters
are to be read thrice over, then how much more says De Principum Epistolis
prouerbio dicitur, ter eas legendas, sed profecto Dei Epistolae, sic enim
Scripturam appellar Gregorius, septies ter, imo septuagies septies, seu vt plus
dicam, i^finities legendae sunt, etc. Luther in Genesis 16.
LVTHER, should the Scriptures be read seven times thrice; yea, seaventy
times 7. times thrice, yea infinite times over. We are commanded, (Prove. 2, 4.)
To seek for Knowledge as for Silver, and to search for her as for hid
treasures. If it be asked where we must seek, the Prophet tells us, (Isa. 35,
16.) Seek in the book of the Lord, and read. If it be asked where we must
search, our Savior tells us: (Ioh. 5.34.) Search the Scriptures. Those are
indeed the Mines where the veins of this silver, and these hid treasures are
to be found. And yet to see how silly men are in wearying themselves by digging
in those earths which yield little precious treasure, and in the mean while
neglect searching these golden Mines. It is our shame and sin that we bestow
more time, and pains in reading any Book more than Gods. What excellent, and
worthy monuments did Ego odi meos libros, and saepe opto eos interire, quod
metuo ne morentur lectores, and abducant a scripturae ipsius lectione quae sola
omnis sapientiae fons est. Luth. in Genes. 19.
LVTHER leave to the world in his Writings, and how well spent is time spent in
reading his works. And yet out of a Zeal to the reading of the Scriptures,
he sticks not to wish that his own books might perish, because he feared
the reading of them would hinder men from reading the Scriptures. What would he
wish now to a number of vain idle, corrupt, and corrupting writings, if he saw
how miserably the Scriptures were neglected for the reading of these?

Now for this present Treatise, I conceive it such a Work as needs not the
Ivy bush of an Epistle commendatorie:

Plaut. in Poen.
Invadibili merce oportet emptorem vltro adducere
Proba merx facile emptorem repperit, tametsi in abstruso sita est.
I say no more of this Authors pains then SOLOMON speaks of the virtuous
Woman, Give him of the fruit of his hands, and let his own work praise him in
the gates. And whether his work will do it, or no, let all prejudice be laid
aside, and do but as PHILIP bids NATHANAEL, (Ioh. 1, 46.) Come and see, And
thou shall soon see, that what I say of this Treatise, is much short of what
it does deserve. Thus wishing that thy profit in the reading may be answerable
to his pains in the writing of this work, I leave thee to the grace of GOD,
and rest,

Thine, in CHRIST JESUS, Ier: Dyke.

THE AVTHORS EPISTLE TO THE READER.
CHRISTIAN READER,
THe Wise man says, that of making many Books, there is no end, and much
study is a wearines of the flesh: (Eccl. 12.12.) And therefore in so great
variety of Books now extant, it will be thy wisdom for thy exercise to make
choice of some few of the best. By which means, thy toil in reading will be
the less, and thy gain the more.

The Book of all Books is the Bible; which by way of Excellency is called the
Scripture. Of which I may say, as DAVID of the Sword of GOLIATH, there is none
like that: (1, Sam, 21.9.) Notwithstanding the Word of the LORD is to many a
reproach, and they have no delight in it: (Ier. 6, 10.) And being full, do
despise the Honey comb: (Prou. 27.7.) Such are but natural, not having the
Spirit: (Iud. 19.) And therefore unable to discern their own need, or where
to be supplied: ( Reu. 3.17.) Others there are, of whom I am persuaded better
things: who having tasted of the good Word of God: (Heb. 6, 9.) And by it also
how gracious the Lord is, do as newborn Babes, desire the sincere milk of
the word, that they may grow thereby: (1. Pet 2.3.) But yet they finding many
things hard to be understood: (2. Pet. 3.16.) And themselves to be but as a
Child weaned from the milk, and drawn from the Breasts: (Isa. 28 9.) Not
having the understanding of a man in them: ( Prou. 30.2) Are by this means
much discouraged from the reading of it; which yet in the very entrance
thereinto, does give light, and understanding to the simple: (Psalm. 119.130.)
Such must know, that as when the Iron is blunt, and the Wood knotty, men put to
the greater strength; so natural defects, in the effecting of difficult
things, and of such consequence, as is the reading of the Scripture, must not
make them to desist; but rather set them on, to be more serious, humble,
orderly, and constant in the reading of the same. And for their further
direction therein, this must be remembered, that the Book of Scripture, is as
the Waters of the Sanctuary, ( Ezekiel. 47.) In which a Lamb might wade, and an
Elephant Swim. Therein is contained strong ^staete, as well as Milk: (Heb.
5.12) Such as do discern themselves to be but Babes, there is Milk provided
for them: And let them leave the strong meat unto such, who by reason of use,
have their senses exercised in discerning good and evil, until themselves
also come to a more full age in Christ: Heb. 5.14,

Now if uch also, shall complain, of the shortness of memory; by means
whereof, together with the prolixity of the Book of GOD, and the various
matter promiscuously couched therein; so as what they have read, is as water
spilt on the ground: (2, Sam. 14.14.) Such with the reading of Scripture, in
the manner aforesaid, must join after meditation: as DAVID, who hid the word
in his heart: (Psalm. 119.11.) And MARY who pondered, and thereby kept those
things, which were told her by the Shepherds: (Luke 2.19.) Moreover, if they
will not be forgetful hearers of the Word, they must be doers of the same:
(Isa. 1.25.) And withal, let them pray the Comforter, which is the HOLY GHOST,
who shall then both teach; and bring all things to their remembrance,
whatsoever he has said unto them.

Notwithstanding all which labor, because many things, as ears of Corn out
of the Sheafe may sl p weak memories; I have therefore gleaned after; and from
the whole B^oke of GOD, as out of a large and fertile Field, gathered up such
Simples, a^ are most Cordial to the weakest Christian, and of sp^ciall use
unto all. Among which, because the Promises, are both the breeders, and
nourishers of Sauing-Faith, the Fountain of Spiritual Life; and therefore of
price unto drooping Spirits, who are weary, and heavy laeden: (Math. 11.28.) I
have for their sakes more principally laid hold upon them; that with joy they
might draw Wat^^ ^^t of the Wells of Salvation: (^sa. 12.3.) And because there
are others also, with whom the Consolations of GOD, are small, or of none
effect; (Job. 15.11.) I h^^^ unto each promise, annexed its conti^^^ Judgment.
And in fine, have summed up all the particular Judgments under the General,
and therewith also, answered such Objections, as are by Carnal Men usually
made.

And out of all, I have also inferred such uses of Reproof, Instruction, and
Exhortation, as the said Scripture has brought to my hand, meetly to be
applied. That if such will but read what is written, and lay hold on
Instruction, they may no longer forsake their own Mercies, but be moved to
come unto CHRIST and live.

All which I have as well as I could, reduced to such Heads, and in such order
Composed them; as by the help of my Table, and Catalogue of Chapters,
immediately ensuing; every Reader may readily find out such places, as he
stands in need of, and shall desire to be furnished with. But with this
Caution to the intelligent Reader; that for such Scriptures, as may diversely
be referred; if in searching he do miss of them in one place, he may find
them in another. And for the better preventing or removing of Scruples from the
ignorant, or tender Conscience; and of Cauils from the wilfully obstinate; I
have Dialogue-wise contrived the same into Question and Answer.

And such things, as in which the Scripture is more plenteous, I have answere^
one Question, with many Scriptures Which the ignorant Reader advisedly
comparing together: that is to say, the dark and obscure places, with those
which a^ more plain, and easy, and the Question with the answer, he shall
find his Iudgemen^ also, in the understanding of such places something bettered
thereby. And if in (...) doing, he shall find himself yet to seek, an^
therefore do say as the Eunuch unto PHILIP How shall I understand these things
without a guide? ( Act 8.31.) Because the Priests lip are to preserve
knowledge, let him therefore seek the Law at their mouth: (Mal. 2.7.^ That by
conference with some learned an^ godly Minister; the knots being unloosed and
the hard shell broken to his hand he may through GODS blessing, at the last
attain unto the sweetness of the Kernel, which is the true sense of
Scripture.

Which work, now some years past I having finished; and at the first onset,
intended for my own private: Notwithstanding by the encouragement of some
learned, and instigation of other Christian friends, I have yielded the same,
as tho^ see, to the Press, for the use of many.

By which my labor, if thou find thy self any thing helped in thy joy, or
some other way Christianly edyfied (leaving the Instrument to vanish in his
own obscurity) let thine eyes be fixed on him, who by the mouths of Babes
and Sucklings, is able to make perfect his own praise. Unto whose Grace I
commend thee.

Thine, if his own, F. B.

(...) shall meet withal; which for lac^^ (...) ^^^e and leisure could not be

CHAP. I. The Preface, or Introduction.
Question.

HOw was Man created?

Answer. 1. In knowledge, after the image of him that created him, Col. 3.10.
Who taught him more than the beasts of the earth, and the fowls of the heaven.
Job 35.11.

2 He was created after God, in righteousness and true holiness. Ephesians. 4.24.

3 In dignity, he was made a little lower than the Angels, and was crowned with
glory and honor, and was made to have dominion over the work of Gods hands,
who did put all things under his feet: Ps. 8 5.6. Genesis 1.28.

Q. Did he continue so?

A. No: for he did eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; of which
the Lord said, thou shall not eat of it: Genesis 2.17. 3.6. whereby he like man,
transgressed the covenant, and trespassed against God: Hos. 6.7. And so sin
entering into the world, all men by him have sinned: Romans 5.12.

Q. What followed this his transgression?

A. 1 Man's understanding is thereby darkened, and he is become a stranger from
the life of God, through the ignorance that is in him: Ephesians. 4.18. Col. 1.21.
Romans 3.11. even a beast by his own knowledge: Ier. 10.14. and 51.17. and like
a wild Ass^ colt, Job 11.12. and much worse, Isai. 1.3. wise he is to do
evil; but to do good he has no knowledge: Ierem. 4.22. and in the thing he
professes himself to be wise, he is become a fool. Romans 1.22. and 8.5. 2
Cor. 3.5.

2 Man's will is thereby also perverted: for hereby the wickedness of man is
great in the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only
and continually evil, Genesis 6.5. and 8.21. And there is no just man on earth
that does good, and sins not: Eccles. 7.20. There is none righteous, no not
one, etc. they have all gone out of the way, they have been made altogether
unprofitable, there is none that does good, no not one, etc. Romans 3.10, 12.
And if any man say he has not sinned, he makes him a liar, and the truth is
not in him. 1 John 1.10.

For who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? Prou.
20.9. And what is man that he should be clean, or the son of man that he
should be just? Job 15.14.

This therefore have I found, that God has made man righteous; but he has
sought many inventions, Eccles. 7.29. Job 25.4. and 14.4. Isa. 1.5, 6. Romans
7.18.

3 The wages of sin is death. (Romans 6.23.) For as by one man sin entered into
the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, (Romans 5.12.) and
reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them also, that had not sinned after the
similitude of Adams transgression, Romans 5.14. Job 17.14.

CHAP. II. Christ promised.
Q. DId God leave man thus?

A. No, For he made a promise before by his Prophets in the holy Scriptures,
concerning his son Jesus Christ, our Lord, Romans 1.2.

Q. Which was the first of that kind?

A. That which was made to Adam and Eve; concerning whom, God said unto the
Serpent, I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed
and her seed: It shall break thine head, and thou shall bruise his heel:
Genesis 3.15.

Q. Show me some more of them, in the manner they were propounded.

A. 1 Without exception of doubt, saying; The Lord thy God will raise unto thee
a Prophet, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, Deuteronomy. 18.15.
He will bring forth his servant the branch, Zach. 3.8. And the man whose name
is the branch, he shall grow up out of his place, (Zach. 6.12.13.) and shall
be King over you, and you shall have one shepherd: Ezech. 37.24.34.24. Ier.
33.17.

2. As uncertain when, and long to come. For says Balaam, I shall see him,
but not now; I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of
Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of
Moab, and destroy the children of Sheth, Numb. 24.17.

3 In a time determined. The Scepter (says Jacob) shall not depart from Judah,
nor a lawgiuer from between his feet until Shiloh come. Genesis 49.10. And
after threescore and two weeks, (...), was the Messiah to be cut off. Dan.
9.26.

4 As near at hand. The Lord ( says Malachi) whom ye seek, shall suddenly
come to his Temple, even the Messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in;
behold, he shall come, says the Lord of hosts. Mal. 3.1.

5 As if already come. For unto us a child is borne, unto us a son is given;
and the government shall be upon his shoulders, and his name shall be called
wonderful, Counceller, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of
peace. Isay 9.6.

6 By the place where. For says Micah, and thou Bethlahem Ephrath, though thou
be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth
unto me, that shall be ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been from of
old, from everlasting. Micah 5.2.

7 By the manner how, which was with much humility. For says Isaiah, he shall
not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets. Isa.
42.2. But he shall be poor, and riding upon an Ass, and upon a Colt, the
foale of an Ass. Zech. 9.9. And he shall grow up before him as a tender plant,
and as a root out of a dry ground: he has neither form nor comeliness when
we shall see him, there shall be no beauty that we should desire him, Isa. 53.2.

8 By his parentage. I will says God raise unto David a righteous branch, Ier.
23.5. And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Iesse, and a branch
shall grow out of his root. Isa. 11.1. For behold, a Virgin shall conceive and
bear a son, and thou shall call his name Immanuel, Isa. 7.14, 16.5. Ier.
33.15.

CHAP. III. Christ exhibited.
Q. Were these promises fulfilled?

A. This day these Scriptures are fulfilled in your ears, Luke 4.21. For when
the fullness of time was come, God sent his Son made of a woman, (Gal. 4.4.)
And of the seed of David has he according to his promise, raised unto Israel,
a Savior Jesus. Acts 13.23.3.18.13, 33.

Ob. These are but idle tales, and who so foolish to believe them?

A. Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and vanish away; for I have wroght a work
in your dais, a work which ye shall not believe, if a man would declare it unto
you. Act. 13.41

Ob. All you can say in this matter, is but by flying reports: than which, what
is more uncertain?

A. We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto
you the power, and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of
his Majesty. 2 Pet. 1.16. For the life was made manifest, and we have seen it,
and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the
Father, and was made manifest unto us, etc. 1 Ioh. 1.2, etc. Act. 26.23.

Q. But yet let us see how by Scripture it may be proved that Jesus was the
Christ.

A. Diverse ways.

1 By the predictions in him fulfilled.

As Micha 5.2. with Mat. 2.5. As Hos. 11.1. with Mat. 2.15. As Isa. 40.3. with
Mat. 3.3. As Isa. 9 1. with Mat. 4.13.14. As Isa. 53.4. with Mat. 8.17. As
Zech. 9.9. with Mat. 21.2. As Isa. 53.9. with 1 Pet. 2.22. As Zach. 11.13 with
Mat. 27.7. As Psalm. 22.18 with Mat. 27.35. As Isa. 53.1. with Ioh. 12.37, 38.
As Psalm. 35.19 with Ioh. 15.24.25. As Psalm. 109.7. with Ioh. 17.12. As Psalm.
2.7. with Acts 13.33. As Exo. 12.46 with Ioh. 19.36. As Zech. 12.10 with Ioh.
19.37.
2 By comparing the types of Christ with the truth.

As Psalm. 78.2. with Mat. 13.34. As Psalm. 69.21. with Mat. 27.48. As Jonah 1.17
with Mat. 12.39.
3 By the witnesses of his coming. For lo, the Angel of the Lord came upon
(...) Shepherds by night, and said unto them Fear not, for behold, I bring
you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people: for unto you is
borne this day, in the City of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord, Luke
2.8.

2 There came Wisemen from the East to Jerusalem to worship him saying; where
is he that is borne King of the Jews, for we have seen his star in the
East. Where upon they being sent by Herod the King to Bethlehem, lo, the star
which they had seen in the East went before them, ti^^ it came, and stood over
the place where the babe was. Mat. 2.1, 9.

3 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John; thissame came for a
witness, to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might
believe. Ioh. 1.6, 7, 15.

4 His Disciples came and worshipped him, saying of a truth, thou art the Son
of God: Math. 14.33. And we believe and are sure, that thou art that Christ,
etc. Ioh. 6. 69, 11, 27.4.29.39, 41, 42. 1 Ioh. 5.20.

5 The multitude that went before him, and followed, cried saying, Hosanna to
the Son of David, blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna
in the highest. (Mat. 21.9.) And many of the people said, of a truth, this is
the Prophet. Others said, this is the Christ. (Ioh. 7.40, 41.) And all men came
to him. Ioh. 3.26, and 10.41.42.

6 Many of the chief rulers believed in him, (Ioh. 12.42.) For the Centurion
and they that were with him, said of him, truly this was the son of God.
(Mat. 27.54.) And Nichodemus, a ruler of the Jews, said unto him, Rabby: we
know that thou art a teacher come from God. Ioh. 3.2.

7 The devil in the man possessed, crying said, what have we to do with
thee, Jesus thou son of God most high? we beseech thee torment us not. Mat.
8.29.

8 God the Father, who both at his baptism, (Mat. 3.17.) and transfiguration
spoke from heaven saying, this is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased,
hear ye him. Mat. 17.5. John 5.32. 2 Pet. 1.17,

9 God the Son bears witness of himself, saying, that he was the Son
of God. Mat. 27.11.43. who though he do bear record of himself, yet his
record is true, Ioh. 8.14.

10 God the holy Ghost, when at his baptism, the heavens opened unto him, John
saw the Spirit of God descending like a Dove, and lighting upon him, Math. 3.16.

11 He that believes in the Son of God, has the witness in himself, and
he that believes not, has made God a liar, because he believes not the
record God gave of his Son, (1 Ioh. 5.10.) and so shall dye in his sins,
Ioh. 8.24.

Ob. Notwithstanding these so many witnesses, that which you do avouch
concerning this man is questioned by many, both Turks, and Pagans.

A. Flesh and blood can not reveal these things unto them, (Mat. 16.17.)
neither can any man say, that Jesus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost, (1 Cor.
12.3.) nor come unto Christ, except the Father draw him. Only they which have
heard, and have learned of the Father, do come unto him, Ioh. 6.44, 45. Ioh.
5.44.

Ob. Not only those of the Gentiles, but many of the Jews also, which were his
own, received him not, Ioh. 1.11. And his brethren did not believe in him.
Ioh. 7.5. Mat. 13.55, 56.

A. A Prophet is not without honor, save in his own Country, Mat. 13.57.

And did you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders
rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? Mat. 21.42.

Yet Apolloes helped them much which had believed through grace. Acts 18.28.
And Paul mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the
Scriptures, that Jesus was the CHRIST. Acts 9.22. and 17.2.3.

Q. But what sign did he show, that we also may see and believe in him?

A. The blind received their sight, the lame did walk, the leopers were
cleansed, the deaf did hear, and the dead were raised up. Mat. 11.5.

Thus this Jesus of Nazareth was approved of God by miracles, wonders a
dsignes, as the Jews themselves could not deny. (Acts 2.22.) So as when that
Christ comes, will he do more miracles than this man has done? (Ioh. 7.31)
But if he wrought such works, as no mere man ever did; although ye believe
not him, yet believe the works, that ye may know, and believe that the Father
was in him, and he in him. Ioh. 10.37, 38.14.10.11. Heb. 2.4.

Q. But did he not work these works by the power of Satan, and by Beelzebub
cast out devils?

A. If this man had not been of God, he could have done nothing: (Ioh. 9.33:)
Therefore not Satan, but the Father that dwells in him, he did the works
(Ioh. 14.10) For can the devil open the eyes of the blind? (Ioh. 10.21.)
Every Kingdom divided against it self, shall not stand, etc. And if Satan
cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom
stand? etc. But if Christ did cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the
Kingdom of God is come unto you, etc. Mat. 12.25, etc. Luke 11.20.

And therefore, how long will ye provoke the Lord? how long will it be ere ye
do believe in Jesus for all the signs which he has showed among you? Numb.
14.11. Ioh. 9.16.9.30.

Ob. Why then say the Scribes that Elias must first come?

A. I say unto you, that Elias is come already, and they knew him not: but they
have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Mat. 17.12.

Q. For my own part, I have no more to say against your allegations, yet want
I the comfort and assurance thereof still.

A. If you will do the will of God, you shall know the doctrine alleged to
be of God, and not of man, Ioh. 7.17. And the comforter whom Christ will send
unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the
Father^ he shall testify of him, and you also shall bear witness of him.
John 15.26.27.

Q. What use are we to make o^ this Doctrine, teaching us the certainty of
Christ being come in the flesh?

A. 1. Herein behold your happiness above many who do see, and hear of these
things: for verily I say unto you, that many Prophets and righteous men have
desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them, and to
hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them, Mat. 13.16.17.

2 According to the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
of the Lord, make his paths straigth, (Mark, 1.3.) in the desert, an high way
for our God. Isa. 40.3.

3 Rejoice greatly (O daughter of Zion) shoute O daughter of Jerusalem, behold,
thy King comes unto thee, (Zech. 9.9.) and cry, saying, Hosanna to the son of
David, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the
highest heavens, Mat. 21.9. And Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he
has visited and redeemed his people; and he has raised up a horn of
salvation for us in the house of his servant David, as he spoke by the mouth of
his holy Prophets, which have been since the world began, Luke 1.68, etc.
Luke 1.54, 55, 46; 47. Mat. 23.39. Mar. 11.10.

4 Oh Zion, that bring good tidings, get thee up into the high mountains of
Jerusalem, that bring good tidings, lift up thy voice, be not afraid, say
unto the Cities of Judah, behold, your God, (Isa. 52.7) and to the daughters of
Zion, behold, thy salvation is come; behold, his reward is with him, and his
work before him, Isa 62.11.

5 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo here is Christ, or lo there, believe
it not: For there shall arise false Christ's, and false prophets, and shall show
great signs and wonders; insomuch, that if it were possible, they shall
deceive the very Elect. Behold, I have told you before; wherefore if they shall
say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert, go not forth, behold, he is in the
secret chambers, believe it not, etc. Mat. 24.23, etc.

Ob. If these tidings be so good, why is Christ said to be a stumbling-blocke
and a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel? Isa. 8.14.

A. Unto you which believe he is precious; only unto them which be
disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head
of the corner, And i^ stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense even to them
that stumble at the Word, being disobedient; whereunto also they were
appointed. 1 Pet 2.7.8. Isa. 59.20.

CHAP. IIII. Union with CHRIST.
Q. What interest have belieuers in Christ, thus promised and exhibited?

A. Christ is wholly ours: for he^ came unto his own, (Ioh. 1.11.) And vnt^ us
a Son is borne, and unto us a child^ ^^^iuen. Isa. 9.6.

Q. By what means came Christ to be ours?

A. By being united unto him: for we are in him that is true, even in the Son
of God, Jesus Christ, (1 Ioh. 5.20.) For says he, Father, I will that they
may be one, as thou O Father art in me, and I in thee, that they may be one in
us, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one. Ioh.
17.21, 23.

He therefore that is joined to the Lord is one spirit, 1 Cor. 6.17. for in the
dispensation of the fulness of times he does gather together in one, all things
in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are in earth, even in him. Ephesians
1.10. Ioh. 14.20.17.11.

Q. By what similitudes, does the Scripture set out this our union with Christ?

A. They are many. 1 Of a building: For thus says the Lord, Behold, I lay in
Zion a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation. Isa.
28.16. And other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid, which is
Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 3.11. In whom all the building fitly framed together,
grows unto an holy Temple in the Lord, Ephesians. 2.21.

2 Of house and inhabitants. Christ as a son is over his own house, whose
house are we, (Heb. 3.7.) In whom you also are builded together for an
habitation of God through the spirit, (Ephesians. 2.22.) who dwells in you, ( 1
Cor. 3.16.) and makes his aboade with you, John 14.23.6.56. 1 Cor. 6.19.

3 Of consanguinity. For both he that sanctifies, and they that are
sanctified, being all one, he is not ashamed to call them brethren, (Heb.
2.11.) But does profess that whosoever does the will of God, is his brother,
sister, and mother, Mark. 3.35.

4 Of husband and wife, unto whom we are betrothed and espowsed, (Hos. 2.19, 20
2 Cor. 11.2.) even as the bride-grome to the bride, (Ioh. 3.29,) whereby our
maker is become our husband, Isa. 54.5. And is the head of his Church, as the
husband is the head of his wife, Ephesians. 5.23.

5 Of head and members. He is the head of the body, the Church, Col. 1.18. and
we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones, (Ephesians. 5.30.) for as
the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body,
being many are one body, so also is Christ, 1 Cor. 12.12. Know ye not therefore
that your bodies are the members of Christ? 1 Cor. 6.15. Ephesians. 1.22, 23.
Collos. 1.24. Romans 12.4, 5.

6 Of the vine and branches. Whereof Christ is the vine, and we are the
branches, John 15.5.

Q. What may this our Union with Christ teach?

A. To examine and to prove your own selves; Kow ye not your own selves,
how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? 2 Cor. 13.5.

Q. Lay me down some marks whereby our union with Christ may be known.

A. 1 Because Christ dwells in our hearts by faith, Ephesians. 3.17. Therefore,
examine your selves whether you be in the faith, 2 Cor. 13.5.

2 Hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given
us. 1 John 3.24. But if any man have not the spirit of Christ, the same is not
his, Romans 8.9. 1 Ioh. 4.13.

3. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, dwells in him,
and he in God. 1 Ioh. 4.15.

4. By this shall all men know that you are his Disciples, if ye have love one
to another. (Ioh. 13.^5.) God is love, and he that dwells in love, dwells
in God and God in him. 1 Ioh. 4.16.1.4.11, 12:1.2.9.10.

5. Whosoever abides in him, sins not; whosoever sins, has not seen
him, nor known him, 1 Ioh. 3.6. But he that keeps the commandments dwells
in him, and he in him, 1 Ioh. 3.24: Ioh. 15.5.6:13.18. Gal. 5.24.

Q. What if upon due examination I do find my self to be out of Christ?

A. For this cause, bow your knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory, etc. that Christ
may dwell in your hearts by faith, that you being rooted and grounded in love,
may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth and length, and
depth and height, and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that
ye may be filled with all the fulness of God. Ephesians. 3.14.

Q. What if I find my self to be in Christ?

A. Then clean fast unto him without separation, 1 Cor. 7.35. And hold the
head, from which all the body, by joints and bands having nourishment
ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God Col. 2.19.

2. He that says, he abides in him, ought himself also to walk, even as he
walked ( 1 Ioh. 2.6.) For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision avails any
thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. Gal, 6.15.

Therefore, having put on the Lord Jesus Christ, make no provision for the
flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof: Romans 13.14: Romans 7.4. Col. 2.6.7. Gal.
5.24.

Q. What follows upon this our union with Christ?

A. Our communion. God is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship
of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, 1. Cor. 1.9. For says he, I stand at the
door and knock, if any hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to
him, and sup with him, and he with me: Revel 3.20. Cant. 5.1. Prou. 9.1, etc.

Q. Wherein have we communion with Christ?

A. In his life. For because he lives, you shall live also: (John 14.19) And
As the living Father sent him, and he lives by the Father; so he that eats
him shall live by him: (John 6.57.) For in him was life, and the life was the
light of man. (John 1.4.) whereby we live, yet not we any more, but Christ
lives in us. Galat. 2.20. Ephesians. 5.14. Romans 6.8. 2 Cor. 4.10. John 11.25, 14.6.

2 In his sufferings, who being lifted up from the earth, he does draw all men
unto him, (Ioh. 12.32.) who are crucified with him, Gal. 2.20.

3 In his death, Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus
Christ, were baptized into his death? Romans 6.3.

4 In his burial. Therefore we are buried with him in baptism, into death,
Romans 6.4. Col. 2.12.

5 In his resurrection. We are risen with him through the faith of the
operation of God, who has raised him from the dead: (Col. 2.12.) For if the
Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you, he that has
raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his
Spirit that dwells in you, Romans 8.11, and 6.5.

6 In his ascension, making us to sit together in heavenly places, in Christ
Jesus: Ephesians. 2.6.

Q. Had the Fathers who lived before Christ this communion with him?

A. Brethren, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers
were under the cloud, and all passed through the Sea, and were all baptized unto
Moses in the cloud, and in the Sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat,
and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual
rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ, 1 Cor. 10.1. and Ioh. 8.56.

Q. What then may this our Communion with Christ teach us?

A. 1 Not to know any thing save Jesus Christ, and him crucified, 1 Cor. 2.2.
To know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his
sufferings, being made conformable unto his death: Phil. 3.10. Col. 3.1.

2. To walk worthy of him, 1 These. 2.12. For this is the message we have heard
of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at
all. If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie and
do not truly: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
fellowship one with another: 1 Ioh. 1.5.

Q. What follows upon this our union, and communion with Christ?

A. 1 If we be one body in Christ, we are every one another members, Romans
12.8. Ephesians. 4.25. 1 Cor. 12.27.

2 There is a community among these members, (Act. 4.32.) Whereby in giving and
receiving one does communicate unto another, (Phil. 4.15.) And so are
comforted, by the mutual faith each of other: Romans 1.11.12

Q. What does this our union with the members of Christ teach us?

A. To keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Ephesians. 4.3, etc. And
to let this peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which you are also called
in one body, (Col. 3.15.) And all speaking one thing, there may be no division
among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in
the same judgment, 1 Cor. 1.10. Ephesians. 4.15, 16. Psalm. 133.1, 2. Genesis 13.8,
9. Pro. 15.17:17.1.17.9.14: Eccl. 4.6. Col. 3.8.9, 10. James 4.1. Romans 14.19. 2
Cor. 13.11.

Q. What does our communion with these members teach us?

A. 1 That no man seek his own wealth, but every one one another wealth, ( 1
Cor. 10.24.) Rejoicing with them that rejoice, and weeping with them that
weep, and to be of the like affections one toward another, Rom 12.15, 16.
Whereby, if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it, or if one member
be honored, all the members rejoice with it, 1 Cor. 12.26.

2 Because all members have not the same office, Romans 12.4. But have gifts that
are diverse, (Romans 12.6.) Such as are strong ought to bear with the infirmities
of the weak, not pleasing themselves, but let every man please his neighbor
in that which is good, to the use of edification, Romans 15.1.2.3. 1 Cor. 12.14,
etc.

Q. I would gladly hear you to express yet more fully what we are the beter
for this union, and communion with Chrst?

A. My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory, by
Christ Jesus: (Phil. 4.19.) By whom all things are yours, etc. ( 1 Cor. 3.21,
etc.) which do appertain unto life, and godliness, through the knowledge of
him that has called us to glory and virtue: ( 2 Pet. 1.3.) For he that has
given Christ unto us, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
Romans 8.32. Mar. 2.27. 2 Cor. 4.15. Ioh. 1.16. Col. 2.10. 1 Cor. 1.5.

Q. What may the consideration of this teach us?

A. To do as the wise Merchant did, who seeing good pearls, when he had
found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had to buy the
same: Math. 13.44, etc.

Q. What spiritual blessings are with Christ to be had?

A. Of him are we in Christ Jesus, who is of God made unto us righteousness,
and sanctification, 1 Cor. 1.30.

Q. How shall man be just with God? Job 9.2.25.4.

A. Christ Jesus, who knew no sin, became sin for us, that we might be
made the righteousness of God in him: ( 2 Cor. 5.21.) For as by one man's
disobedience many were made sinners; so by the obedience of one, shall many be
made righteous. Romans 5.19. Isa. 53.9.53 11.12: Ezekiel. 16.9.

Ob. But what did Christ in our behalf, that could be available for
righteousness, either for the fathers who lived so many years before him, or
unto us who do live so long after?

A. By one offcring, he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified:
whereof also, the holy Ghast is a witness: (Heb. 10.14, 15.) Not that Christ
should offer himself often, as the high Priests entered into the holy place,
every year with the blood of others; for then must he often have suffered
since the foundation of the world. But now once in the end of the world, has
he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself: Heb. 9.25.10.18.

Q. Is then the guiltiness, and punishment of sin taken away by Christ?

A. This is a faithful saying, and worthy all acceptance, that Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners, 1 Timothy 1.15. And you know that he was made
manifest, that he might take away our sins, ( 1 Ioh. 3.5.) who his own self
bare our sins in his own body on the Tree, 1 Pet. 2.24. which was prefigured by
the scape-gote, (Leu. 16.21, 22.) Thus it is written, and thus it behooved
Christ to suffer, and that remission of sins should be preached in his name
among all Nations, beginning at Jerusalem: Luke 24.26.27.

Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is
preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: Act. 13.38. Math. 9.2:1.21.
Reuelat. 1.5, 6. Ioh. 1.29.

Ob. By what authority did he these thing? And who gave unto Christ this
authority to forgive sins? Math. 12.23. Mar. 2.7.

A. As no man took this honor to himself, (to offer for sin) but he that was
called of God as was Aaron: So also Christ glorified not himself to be made
an high Priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, this day have I
begotten thee, he gave it him, (Heb. 5.4.) And has exalted him with his right
hand, to be a Prince, and Savior, for to give repentance unto Israel, and
forgiveness of sins, (Act. 5.31,) But that ye may know that the Son of man
has power on earth to forgive sins (he says to one sick of the palsy) I say
unto thee, arise and take up thy bed; who immediately arose, and took up his
bed, and went forth among them all. Mar. 2.10. etc.

Q. What witnesses can you produce to convince us of remission of sins by
Christ?

A. Caiaphas (though his enemy) yet being high priest, professed that Jesus
should dye for the Nation of ^he Jews, and not for that Nation only, but that
also he should gather together in one, the Children of God, that were
scattered abroad, (Ioh. 1^.51, 52.) To whom also give all the Pro^hets
witness, That through his name whosoever believes in him, should receive
remission of sins, (Acts 10.43.) This is he that came b^ water and blood;
even Jesus Christ, not by water only, but by water and blood; and it is the
Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth. For there are three
that bear record in heaven; the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost; and
these three are one: And there are three that bear witness in earth; the
Spirit, and water, and blood: and these three agree in one. Ioh. 15.6, etc.

Q. But will God make good their testimony?

A. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sin, ( 1 Ioh. 1.9.) For when David said unto Nathan, I have sinned: Nathan
said unto David, The LORD also has put away thy sin: 2 Samuel 12.13. Isa. 6.5,
etc. 2 Chro. 7.14. Mat. 18.26, 27. Luke 15.18, etc.

Q. Is there no forgiveness of sin without confession?

A. He that covers his sins shall not prosper; only, he that confesses
and forsakes his sins shall have mercy, Pro. 28.13. For says David, When I
kept silence, my bones waxed old, through my roaring all the day long, etc. I
acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I said I
will confess my transgressions, and thou forgauest the iniquity of my sin.
Psalm. 32.3, etc. Luke 15.18.

Q. What are the sins which God, for Christ's sake will forgive?

A. He will cleanse them from all their iniquities; whereby they have sinned
against him, and he will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned
and whereby they have transgressed against him. Ier. 33.8. And the blood of
Jesus Christ his Son, cleanses us from all sin: 1 Ioh. 1.7. Psalm. 130.8:85.2.

Q. How far forth does God forgive sins?

A. To the utmost extent thereof: For, 1 God was in Christ reconciling the
world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, 2. Cor. 5.19.

2 As not seen, For he has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he
seen perverseness in Israel, (Numb. 23.21.) Whereby when the iniquity of
Israel shall be sought for, there shall be none, and the sins of Judah, and
they shall not be found, etc. Ierem. 50.20. Isa. 38.17. Psalm. 85.2. Ezekiel. 16.8.

3. As not remembered, For he will be merciful unto our unrighteousness, and
our sins, and iniquities will he remember no more: Heb. 8.12.

4 As far away removed, For as heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
mercy toward them that fear him: as far as the East is from the West, so
far has he removed our transgressions from us, Psalm. 103.11, 12.

5 As swallowed up. He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us, he
will subdue our iniquities, and cast all their sins into the depth of the
sea, Micah 7.19.

7 As a cloud vanished. He has blotted out as a thick cloud our
transgressions, and as a cloud our sins Isai. 44.22.

7 As a writing defaced. I, says God, even I am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions. Isai. 43.25.

Q. Why? is the curse of sin with the guilt taken away by Christ?

A. GOD sent not his Son into the World to condemn us, but that we through
him might be saved, (John 3.17.) For surely he has borne our griefs, and
carried our sorrows, etc. He was wounded for our transgressions, he was
bruised for ouri-niquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and
with his stripes we are healed, etc. Isa. 53.4.5.

There is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, Romans 8.1.
For he has redeemed them from the curs of the Law, by being made a curse for
them: as it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree. Gal. 3.13:
Romans 5.14, etc. Ioh. 3.17.

Q. What moved the Lord, through Christ to take away our sins?

A. We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according
to the riches of his grace, (Ephesians. 1.7.) And for his own names sake, ( 1 Ioh.
2.12.) If the Lord indeed should mark iniquities, who should stand? But there
is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared: Psalm. 130.3, 4: Ezech. 20.44:
Isa. 43.21.

Q. What would you infer upon this so rich and plentious grace of God?

A. Even as David, who describes the blessedness of the man, unto whom God
imputes righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are they whose
iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; Blessed is the man unto
whom the Lord will not impute sin, Romans 4.67.8.

Ob. This blessedness might belong to Abraham, and such as he was, but not
unto me, and such as I am?

A. It was not written for his sake alone, that it was not imputed, but unto us
also to whom it shall not be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up
Jesus our Lord from the dead, Romans 4.23. 1 Timothy 1.16.

Ob. Many alas are the duties I might have performed, which I have foolishly
omitted?

A. He will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices, or thy burnt offerings, to
have been continually before him, Psalm. 50.8.

Ob. Multitudes of actual transgressions, also have I committed, some of
ignorance, or without observation, many whereof are out of mind and forgotten.

A. Who can understand hts errors? Therefore say unto God, Cleanse thou me
from my secret faults, (Psalm. 19.12.) For as the high priest, under the Law
went alone, once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself,
and for the errors of the people, (Hebr. 9.7. Leu. 4.2, etc. 5.15, etc.) So
CHRIST Jesus by his own blood entered into the holy place, having obtained
eternal redemption for us, Hebr. 9.12: Acts 3.17.19. 1 Timothy 1.13: Luke 7.47:
Psalm 78.40.41: Acts 13.18: Psalm. 78, 38.39.

Ob. But I have sinned also of knowledge, yea, presumptuously, and with an high
hand.

A. Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD, though your sins be as
scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson,
they shall be as wool, (Isai, 1.18.) For verily I say unto you, all manner of
sins and blasphemies shall be forgiven unto men. Math. 12.31: Leu.
5.13.6.5.6.7. Leu. 19.20, etc. Luke 7.47. 2 Chro. 33.9, etc. 1 Timothy 1.3. Act.
9.1.26.9, etc. 1 Timothy 1.13, 15: Micah 7.18.19. Deuteronomy. 9.19: Luke 15.13.

Ob. But I have long lived in the practice of these horrible wickednesses.

A. As the Labourer working but one hour had his penny, (Mat. 20.8.) And the
thief on the Cross his paradise, (Luke 23.43.) So when the wicked man turns
away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is
lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. Because he considers and
turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall
surely live, he shall not dye: Ezekiel 18.27.28.

Ob. Whatsoever you can say to the contrary, my own conscience tells me, that I
am no better then a condemned man.

A. As for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day
that he turns from his wickedness, (Ezechiel 33.12.) For when God says
unto thee, Thou shall surely dye, if thou turn from thy sin, and do that
which is lawful and right, etc. thou shall surely live, thou shall not die,
etc. Ezekiel. 33; 14.15.19.

Q. If the Lord should pardon us many thousands of times, yet shall we
continue to provoke him still?

A. My little children, these things I write unto you that you sin not: And
if any man do sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous, and he is the propitiation for all our sins: ( 1 Ioh. 2.2.) For
whose sake the Lord is slow to anger, and plentiful in mercy, (Psalm. 103.8.)
Long suffering, abounding in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,
forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin, (Exodus 34 6.) Yea, for his names
sake will he defer his anger; and for his praise will he refrain from thee,
that he cut thee not off: Isa. 48.9: Psalm. 40.11, 12:86, 5: Neh. 9.26, etc.

Ob. There is no man living that will forgive after this manner; how then
should I in the conscience of so much guiltiness, dare to look God in the
face?

A. Gods thoughts are not as your thougths, neither are his ways your ways:
For as the heavens are higher then the earth, so are his ways higher then your
ways, and his thoughts, then your thoughts, (Isa. 55.7, 8, 9.) For you say, if
a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's; shall
he return unto her again? shall not the Land be greatly polluted?
Notwithstanding, though thou have played the harlot with many lovers, yet
return again unto me says the Lord: Ierem. 3.1.

Ob. But besides my sin and guiltiness, my very righteousnesses are but as
filthy rags, Isa. 64.6.

A. Christ Jesus he was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners.
Heb. 7.26. And is the end of the Law for righteousness unto every one that
believes? (Romans 10.4.) For which cause, this is the name by which he was
called, The Lord our righteounesse: Ier. 33.6. Math. 3.15: Cant. 1.5: Zech.
3.3, 4.

Ob. But the Law seems to impose a curse upon those that perform not as well
personal, as perfect obedience unto the same: Deuteronomy. 27.26.

A. The Law is not made for a righteou^ man, but for the Lawless and
disobedient For the ungodly and profane, for murderers of fathers, for
murderers of mothers for man-slayers, for them that defile themselves with
mankind; for man-stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any
other thing, that is contrary to sound Doctrine 1 Timothy 1.9.

Q. These things were good indeed if my heart could be drawn to believe them.

A. Christ Jesus being ascended up unto the Father, will send the Comforter
unto you. And when he is come, he will convince you of righteousness; and that
upon this ground; Because he goes unto the Father, and you shall see him no
more: Ioh. 16.7.

Q. What is our work we have to do for the furthering and procuring of our
own justification?

A. This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he has sent, (Ioh.
6.29.) And the just shall live by faith, Hab. 2.4.

For what says the Scripture? Abraham believed GOD, and it was accounted unto
him for righteousness. Romans 4.3. Galathians 3.6.8. James 2.23. Romans 3.21.22
For the Scripture foreseeing that GOD would justify the Gentiles through
faith, preached before the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the
Gentiles ( being in themselves full of all unrighteousness: Romans 1.29.) be
blessed: Gal. 3.8.

Ob. But was not Abraham our Father justified by works, when he had offered
Isaac his Son upon the Altar, (James 2.21.) And will you herein so include
faith, as wholly to exclude works? James 2.24.

A. By works Abraham was manifested, but not made just: James 2.18.

Moreover, that no man is justified by the Law; it is evident for the just
shall live by Faith, (Galathians 3.11.) And when we were yet of no strength,
CHRIST dyed for the ungodly, (Romans 5.6.) to declare at this time his
righteousness that he might be just, an^ a iustifier of him which believes in
Jesus (Romans 3.26.) By whom all that beleeu^ are justified from all things, from
which they could not be justified by the Law (...) Moses, (Acts 13.39.) And to
him tha^ works not, but believes in him that justifies the ungodly, his
faith is accounte^ unto him for righteousness, Romans 4.5.

Moreover, the Law is weak through the flesh, (Romans 8.3.) And all having
sins (Romans 3.23.) by the Law comes the knowledge of sin, (Romans 3.20.)
Whereby, s^ many as are of the works of the Law, ar^ under the curse. Gal.
3.10.

Whereupon the Gentiles which followed not righteousness, have attained to
righteousness; even the righteousness which is of faith. But Israel which
followed after the Law of righteousness, has not attained the Law of
righteousness, wherefore? because they sought it not by faith; but as it were by
the works of the Law: For they stumbled at the stumbling stone, (Romans 9.30.)
And if Abraham were justified by works, he has whereof to glory, but not
before GOD, Romans 4.2.

Seeing then it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and
uncircumcision through faith, (Romans 3.30.) Therefore we conclude, that a man
is justified by faith without the deeds of the Law: Romans 3.28: 1 Cor. 4.4: Romans
3, 21, 22. Gal. 2.16:3.8.4.3.2.

Ob. But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed,
saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and commanded to keep the
whole Law of Moses. Acts 15.5.

A. Men and brethren, you know, how that a good while ago, God made choice
among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the Word of the Gospel,
and believe; now therefore these men did but tempt God, in putting a yoke upon
the neck of the Disciples, which neither our fathers, nor we were able to
bear: Acts 15.7.10.

Ob. Moses himself describes the righteousness which is of the Law, that the
man which does those things shall live by them?

A. But the righteousness which is (...) faith speaks on this wise, Say no^
thou in thine heart, Who shall ascen^ into Heaven, that is, to bring down
CHRIST from above? Or who shall descend down into the deep, that is, to bring
CHRIST from the dead? But what says it?

The Word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thine heart, that is, the
Word of faith which we preach. And which with the heart we believe unto
righteousness: Romans 10.6.

Q. Is the Law then against the promise?

A. GOD forbid. For if there had been a Law given which could have given life,
verily, righteousness should have been by the Law; but the Scripture has
concluded all under sin, that the promise of the faith of JESUS CHRIST might
be given to them that believe. Gal. 3.21.

Q. If righteousness be not by the Law; why was it exhibited?

The Law was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come, to
whom the promise was made, Galathians 3.19.

And it was our Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ: Gal. 3.24.

Moreover, the Law entered that the offense might abound; but where sin
abounded, grace did much more abound; that as sin had reigned unto death, so
might grace reign through righteousness, unto eternal life, by JESUS CHRIST
our Lord: Romans 5.20, 21.

Ob. But if while we seek to be justified by CHRIST, we our selves are
found sinners; Is therefore Christ the minister of sin? Gal. 2.17

A. GOD forbid. For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make my
self a trespasser: For, I through the Law, am dead to the Law, that I might
live unto GOD: (Gal. 2.17.) You therefore are as free, an^ not using your
liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God, ( 1 Pet
2.16.) But if ye are lead by the spirit, ye ar^ not under the Law, (Gal. 5.18.)
The fruit^ whereof, is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentlense, goodness,
faith, meeknes, te^perance; against such there is no Law: Gal. 5.22.

Q. You have well satisfied me in the article of justification, tell me
therefore what use I am to make thereof?

A. 1 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and
let him return unto the Lord; for he will have mercy upon him, and to our
God; for he will abundantly pardon, (Isai. 55.7.) and will blot out their
sins, when the time of refreshing shall come: Acts 3.19.

But if they will not obey his voice, let them beware of him; for he will not
pardon their transgressions, (Exo. 23.21.) But the soul that does
presumptuously, shall be cut off from among his people: Numbers 15.30, 31.

2. Take unto you words, and turn unto the Lord, and say unto him; Take away
all iniquity, and receive us graciousty, (Hosea 14.2.) Pardon I beseech thee
mine iniquities according to the greatness of thy mercies, (Numb. 14.19.) And
enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living
be justified. Psalm. 143.2. and 41.4.51.1, etc. 25.11.

3 Because when you have thus prayed, the Lord will say, I have pardoned
according to thy words, Number. 14.20. therefore hope in the Lord, for with the
Lord there is mercy, and with him is plentiful redemption^ Psalm. 130.7:131.3.

4 Say, Who is a God like unto thee, that pardons iniquity, and passes by
the transgresions of the remnant of his heritage? he retains not his anger
for ever, because he delights in mercy, Micah 7.18. Psalm. 103.1, etc. Isa.
44.23.

5 Say, Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods children? It is God that
justifies, who is he that condemns? It is Christ that is dead, yea rather
that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes
intercession for us, (Romans 8.33.) For in the Lord shall the seed of Israel be
justified, and shall glory: Isa. 45.25. and 61.10.

6 Account therefore all things but loss for the excellent knowledge of Christ
Jesus your Lord. For whom Paul also suffered the loss of all things, and did
account them but dung, that he might win Christ; and be found in him, not
having his own righteousness which is of the Law; but that which is through
the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of GOD through faith: Phil.
3.8.9. and 3.3, etc. --

7 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made you free, and
be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage: Gal. 5.1.

8 What shall we say then; shall we continue still in sin, that grace may
abound? God forbid, (Romans 6.1, 2.) And shall we sin because we are not under
the Law, but under grace? God forbid. For brethren, you have been called unto
liberty; only use not your liberty for an occasion to the flesh, Gal. 5.13:
Romans 7.5, 6: 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. 1 Peter 4.1. etc. Romans 7.1, etc. 8.12.

9 Be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as
God for Christ's sake has forgiven you, (Ephesians. 4.32.) For if you forgive men
their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive ^ou: But if you do
not forgive men their trespasses, no more will your heavenly Father forgive you
your trespasses: Math. 6.14.15: Col. 3.13: Mat. 18.22. Math. 18.33.

CHAP. VI. Reconciliation.
Q. YOu having thus dispatched the promise of justification, tell me what grace
is that which does next and immediately flow from it?

A. Being justified by faith, we have peace toward God, through our Lord
Jesus Christ, (Romans 5.1.) Who is our peace, and has broke down the middle
wall of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even
the Law of commandments, contained in ordinances, for to make to himself one
new man, and so making peace, Ephesians. 2.14. whereby in Christ Jesus, we who
sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ: and by him we
have an access by one spirit unto the Father. Ephesians. 2.13. Col. 1.21.2.14. 2
Cor. 5.19. 1 Timothy 2.5, Isa. 26.3:27.4. 2 These. 3.16.

Q. May not this peace and agreement once made, be again lost?

A. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world gives
it, give I unto you, (Ioh. 14.27.) For this is as the waters of Noah; for as I
have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I
sworn, that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee: for the mountains
shall depart, and the hills shall be removed; but my kindness shall not depart
from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, says the Lord
that has mercy on thee: Isa. 54.9. Numb. 25.12 Isa. 9.7. Phil. ^.7.

Q. What other grace has this peace with God attending it?

A. Joy in the holy Ghost, (Romans 14.17.) whereby the meek shall joy in the
Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of Israel, (Isa.
29.19.) And shall be full of joy with his countenance, (Act. 2.28.) And be
satisfied as with marrow, and fatness: Psalm. 63.5.

By means whereof Job had songs in the night, (Job 35.10.) And David was made
exceeding glad with Gods countenance, Psalm. 21.6: Nehe. 12.43: Psalm. 33.21:
Ier. 4.2: Psalm. 104.34: Ioh. 15.11: 17.13: Psalm. 89.15. Isa. 65.18. Acts
8.39:16.34.13.52. Psa. 4.7. Isa. 9.3.

Q. What follows upon this our peace and joy in God?

A. 1 Peace with men. For then shall they beat their swords into plowshares,
and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against
nation, neither shall they learn war any more, Isa. 2.4. The wolf shall
dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the
calfe, and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall
lead them. Isa. 11.6. The hatred of Ephaim shall depart, and the adversaries of
Judah shall be cut off. Ephraim shall not envy Judah, neither shall Judah vex
Ephraim: Isa. 11.13.65.25. Micha. 4.3. Zech. 3.10. Genesis 21.27. Zech. 9.10. Isa.
66.12.

2 Peace with all other creatures. For they are at league with the stones of
the field, and the beasts of the field, they are at peace with them: Job. 5.23.

Because God has established his covenant with them, and with their seed after
them, and with every living creature; of the foul, of the cattle, and of
every beast of the earth, (Genesis 9.9.) and with the creeping things of the
ground, (Hosea 2.18.) And the fear of them, and the dread of them, shall be
upon every beast of the earth, upon every foul of the air, upon all that
moves upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into their hand are
they delivered: Genesis 9.2.

Ob. You tell me of peace and joy, but behold trouble and sorrow: Ier. 4.10.

A. You now have sorrow, but your hearts shall rejoice, and your joy shall no
man take from you, Ioh. 16.22. For light is sown for the righteous, and joy
for the upright in heart: Ps. 97.11. Mark the perfect man, behold the upright,
for the end of that man is peace, (Psalm. 37.37.) And though now the earth be
moved, and though the mountains fall into the midst of the Sea; though the
waters thereof rage, and be troubled, and the mountains shake at the surges of
the same; yet there is a river whose stream shall make glad the City of God,
(Psalm 46.2.) Whereby they shall lift up their voice, and shall shout for the
magnificence of the Lord, and shall rejoice: Isa. 24.14.

Q. What are the means whereby this joy and peace with God, and the creature,
may be maintained?

A. 1 Pray, saying, The Lord of peace, give us peace, always, by all means. (
2 These. 3.16.) That we may see the good of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in
the gladness of thy Nation, that we may glory with thine inheritance, (Psalm.
106.5.) Let the righteous be glad, let them rejoice before thee, yea let them
exceedingly rejoice, Ps. 68.3.51:8.5.11.40.16.48.11.122, 6.7: 1 Samuel 25.6.

2 The work of righteousness is peace, (Isa. 32.17.) And to as many as walk
according to this rule, Peace shall be on them, (Gal. 6.16.) I will therefore
hear what God the Lord will speak, for he will speak peace unto his people,
and to his Saints: but let them not turn again to folly, Psalm. 85.8. For the
wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up
mire, and dirt; There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked: Isa.
57.20.48.22: Romans 8.6:14.17: James 3.18. 2 Corinthians. 13.11.

3 If you would have peace with men, provide things honest in the sight of all
men. If it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men,
(Romans 12.18.) And therefore seek peace and pursue it, (Psalm. 34.14.) And
follow hard after the things that make for it: Romans 14.19.

4 Would you have peace with the creatures? To the pure, all things are pure,
(Titus 1.15.) And every creature of God is good, if it be received with
thanksgiving: For it is sanctified by the word of God, and by prayer: 1 Timothy
4.4.5.

CHAP. VII. Adoption, and Regeneration.
Q. What follows upon our justification, and reconciliation?

A. To be the children of God through faith in Christ Jesus, (Gal. 3.26.) For
to as many as received him, to them he gave this prerogative to be his sons,
even to them that believe in his name, Ioh. 1.12. Who came to redeem us that
were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of sons, Gal. 4.5.

Behold, therefore what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that
we should be called the sons of God: 1 Ioh. 3.1. Math. 5.9. Revel. 21.7.

Ob. This seems to be no great matter, for they live in no such outward pomp;
nay their condition seems to be worse than other men's: Psalm. 73.5.

A. The Kingdom of God is not of meat and drink, (Romans 14.17.) nor comes
with observation; neither shall they say, Lo here, or lo there: for behold,
the Kingdom of God is within you, (Luke 17.20.) and is all glorious there:
Psalm. 45.13.

Q. But what portion, and inheritance has God for such as be his children?

A. The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand, (Ioh.
3.35.) In whom we also have obtained an inheritance, (Ephesians. 1.11.) For, if we
be children, then are we heirs, heirs of God, and ioynt-heires with Christ:
Romans 8.17. Gal. 4.7. Psalm. 16.5.

Ob. This belonged unto Abraham, and to his seed, but not to the sinners of the
Gentiles.

A. If you be Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to
promise, Gal. 3.29. Neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all
children; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called, that is, they which are the
children of the flesh, they are not the children of God, but the children of
the promise are counted for the seed: Romans 9.7.

Now we brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise, Gal. 4.28.3.7. 1
Pet. 3.6.1.2.10: Luke 19.9: Mat. 3.9: Ioh. 8.39.47. Hos. 1.10.2.23: Isa. 65.1.

Ob. This privilege may concern some great personages of the Gentiles, but
not such abject, and despised persons as I am.

A. Hearken my beloved brethren, has not God chosen the poor of this world,
rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he has promised to them that
love him, James 2.5.

For you see your calling, how that not many wise men after the flesh, nor many
mighty, nor many noble are called; but God has chosen the foolish things of
the world to confound the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the
world, confound the things that are mighty; a^ base things of the world, and
things wh^ are despised has God chosen, yea, thi^ which are not, to bring to
naught thi^ that are, that no flesh should glory in presence: 1 Cor. 1.26. Isa.
66.2.

Ob. If I could do some thing wo^thy of such a reward, there were the some
hope.

A. God has called us, not according works, but according to his own purpose,
a^ grace whieh was given us in Christ Ies^^ before the world began, 2 Timothy 1.9.
For (...) promise made to Abraham, that he sho^ be the heir of the world, was
not to ^braham and his seed through the Law, (...) through the righteousness
of faith: For they which are of the Law be heirs, faith made void, and the
promise made of none ^fect: To. 4.13.11.5: Luke 17.7. Tit. 3.3.

Ob. Notwithstanding, it will not o^ of my mind, but that it is my well d^ing
(if at all) that must enter me in this estate.

A. This persuasion comes not of him that calls you, (Gal. 5.8.) For God
sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law to redeem them that
are under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons, Gal. 4.4.5.
And therefore tell me, you that desire to be under the Law, do you not hear
the Law? For it is written, Cast out the bondwoman, and her son, for the
son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman: Gal.
4.21. Genesis 21.10.

Q. How comes it then to pass, that we miserable creatures should be so
highly exalted?

A. We have not chosen him, but he has chosen us, (Ioh. 15.16.) And has
predestined us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ, to himself,
according to the good pleasure of his will, (Ephesians. 1.5.11.) For behold the
heaven, and the heaven of heaven is the Lords; the earth also, with all things
that therein is. Only the Lord has a delight in us, and has chosen us above
al people, as it is this day: Deu. 10.14. Isa. 60.21. Romans 11.5.

Ob. Can it be imagined that me^ instamped with the devils image should become
the children of God?

A, No: For there are also given unto us, great and precious promises, that
(...) these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the
corruption that (...) in the world through lust, ( 2 Pet. 1.4. Whereby we have
put off the old man wit^ his deeds, and have put on the new man which is
renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created us, Col. 3.9. An^ are
changed into the same image, from glory, to glory: 2 Cor. 3.18.

Q. What are the causes by which this Image of God is wrought in us?

A. 1 Principal efficient, the Spirit of the Lord, ( 2 Cor. 3, 18.) For we are
borne not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man; but
of God, (Ioh. 1.13.) That which is borne of the flesh, is flesh; and that which
is borne of the Spirit, is Spirit: Ioh. 3.6.8: Tit. 3.5.

2 Isntrumental, the word. For of his own will begat he us with the word of
truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures, (James 1.18.)
Being borne again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word
of God, which lives and abides for ever: 1 Pet. 1.23.

3 Ministering; the Preachers who do beget us by the Gospel, ( 1 Corinthians.
4.15.) And do travel in birth until Christ be formed in us: Gal. 4.19: Isa.
66.8: 1 Cor. 9.1.2.

Q. How may we know our selves to have this image and so to be the children of
God?

A. By these marks, we know that we are of God; when yet the whole world
lies in wickedness: 1 Ioh. 5.19.

1 God himself has sealed us, and has given the earnest of the spirit in our
hearts, ( 2 Cor. 1.22.) which spirit bears witness with our spirits that we
are the children of God: Romans 8.16.

2 He that believes on the Son, has the witness in himself, that he is
borne of God: 1 Ioh. 5.10.5.1.

3 He that is of God, hears Gods word, John 8.47. And as newborn babes, do^
desire that sincere milk of the Word, tha^ he may grow thereby: 1 Peter 2.2.

4 If you know that he is righteous, you know, every one that does
righteousness, i^ borne of him, ( 1 John 2.29.) And being newborn, he does
not commit sin, because his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin
because he is borne of God. In thi^ therefore are the children of God known,
and the children of the devil, whosoever does not righteously is not of God, 1
Ioh. 3.9.3 Epist. 11: Romans 8.14.

5 Love is of God, and every one that loves is borne of God, and knows God:
1 John 4.7.

6 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.
Mat. 5.9.

But if you have bitter envying, and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie
not against the truth, (James 3.14.) For your spot is not the spot of his
children; they that are such, are a crooked and perverse generation* Deuteronomy.
32.5. Hosea 1.9: Deuteronomy. 32.32, 33. John 8.44: Isa. 57.3.

Q. What may this privilege of being the children if God teach us?

A. 1 To pray that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, ye may know
what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his
inheritance is in the Saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power
to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power: Ephesians 1.18.

2 To call no man your father on earth, for one is your father in heaven,
(Math. 23.9.) But be ye followers of God as dear children: For ye were once
darkness, now are ye light in the Lord, walk as children of the light,
(Ephesians. 5.1.8.) And let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven: Math. 5.16: Mal. 1.6:
1 Pet. 1.17. Ephesians. 4.30.

3 To look diligently that there be no prophaine person, as was Esau: who for
a morsel of meat sold his birthright; for you know how that afterward, when
he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected: For he found no place of
repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears: Hebr. 12.15.16. Genesis
25.32: Hosea 3.3.

CHAP. VIII. Gods disposition to his children.
Q. WHy, what is the disposition o^ this our Father toward us?

A. 1 When he passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold thy time was the
time of love, (Ezeck. 16.8.) For the Father himself loves you, (Ioh. 16.27.)
Which love of his was herein manifested, because he sent his only begotten
Son into the World, that you might live through him: 1 Ioh. 4.9.

Thus the Lord loves the righteous, (Psalm. 146.8.) But the wicked, and him
that loves violence, his soul hates: Psalm. 11.5: Prou. 8.17.15.9: John
14.21: 1 Cor. 8.3. Romans 5.8. 1 Ioh. 3:16.15.9. Ioh. 11.36: Dan. 10.11: Ioh.
17.26: Hos. 14.4.

2 He esteems of us: For the Lords portion is his people, Jacob the lot of
his inheritance, (Deuteronomy. 32.9: Ierem. 10.16: Psalm. 132.13:135.4.) Even a chosen
generation, a royal Priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, 1 Peter. 2,
9: Reu. 1.6, 5, 10. A crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, a Royal diadem
in the hand of their God, (Isa. 62.3.) whereby as one in a certain place
says, so say I, Lord, what is man that thou art so mindful of him, or the
son of man, that thou make account of him? Heb. 2.6. Psalm. 144.3: Job 7.17:
Exo. 19.5. Deuteronomy. 14.2: 1 Pet. 3.4. Psalm. 33.12: Isa. 49.16. Pro. 20.15.

3 The Lord takes pleasure in his people, Psalm. 149.4. He will rejoice over
them with joy, he will rest in his love, he will joy over them with singing:
Zeph. 3.17.

For says Christ to his Church, thou art beautiful my love, as Tirza, comely
as Jerusalem, terrible, as an Army with banners. Turn away thine eyes from
me; for they have overcome me. Cant. 6.4.

Behold, thou art fair my beloved, yea, pleasant, also our bed is green,
(Cant. 1.16. Thou have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse, thou have
ravished my heart, with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. How
fair is thy love my sister, my spouse? how much better is thy love than wine,
and the smell of thine ointments than all spices? Thy lips, O my spouse, drop
as the honey comb, honey and milk are under thy tongue, and the smell of thy
garment, is like the smell of Lebanon. Cant. 4.9:7.1.2.2.2.14.3.6.4.7.2 16:
Psalm. 45.11: Ier. 31.20.

Thus as the bridgrome rejoices over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over
thee, Isa. 62.5. Isa. 62.4.5.7. Hosea 9.10. Psalm 147.11: Pro. 15.26.

Contrarily, the thoughts of the wicked are abomination to the Lord, (Pro.
15.26.) For he is not a God that takes pleasure in wickedness, neither shall
evil dwell with him: Psalm. 5.4: Prou. 26.11:15.8. Psalm. 106.39: Amos 6.8:
Psalm. 78.59. Leuit. 26.30.

4 He has a tender care over them: For he shall feed his flock like a
shepherd, he shall gather his lambs with his arm, and carry them in his
bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young, (Isa. 40.11.) As an
eagle stirs up her nest, fluttereth over her young; spreads abroad her
wings, takes them, bears them on her wings, so the Lord alone leads his
people, and there is no strange God with him, (Deu. 32.11.) And the land also
which they possess, is a land which the Lord their God cares for; the eyes of
the Lord, their God is always upon it, from the beginning of the year, even
unto the end of the year: Deuteronomy. 11.11, 12: 1 Peter 5.7: Hesea 11.3: Cant. 2.6.

Moreover, as a father pittieh his children, so the Lord pittieth them that
fear him. For he knows their frame, he remembers that they are but dust:
Psalm. 103.13: 2 Kings 13.4:13.23.2.14.26, 27. Acts 26.14, 15. Zech. 2.8. Math.
6.25.34.

Q. May not this love of God, and of Christ be through temptation extinguished?

A. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it. If a man
would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be
contemned: Cant. 8.7.

Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? (Romans 8.35.) He is our God
for ever, and ever. Psalm. 48.14.

Q What should this love of Christ teach us?

A. A mutual desire after Christ, and delight in him saying: Lord lift up the
light of thy countenance, (Psalm. 4.6.) and cause thy face to shine upon us,
(Psalm. 67.1.) Set us as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm,
Cant. 8.6. Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for thy love is
better than wine. Draw me, we will run after thee, we will be glad and
rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine, (Cant. 1.2.4.) And
our soul shall follow hard after thee: Psalm. 63.8.132.3: Cant. 8.1. Psalm.
37.4.

For all thy garments smell of mirrh, and aloes, and cassia; out of the yuory
palaces, whereby they have made thee glad, (Psalm. 45.8.) while the king
sits at his table, my spiknard sends forth the smell thereof A bunddle of
mirrh is my well-beloved unto me, he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts; my
beloved is unto me, as a cluster of Camphire in the vineyards of Engedie.
(Cant. 1.12.) And as the aple tree, among the trees of the wood, so is my
beloved among the sons. (Cant. 2.3.) Thou art fairer than the children of
men, grace is powered into thy lips. (Psalm. 45.2.) Thy mouth is most sweet, yea
thou art altogether lovely. (Cant. 5.16.) Therefore my beloved is mine and I am
his, (Cant. 2.16.) I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his
fruit was sweet to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting house, and
his banner over me was love. Stay me with flagons, comfort me with aples, for
I am sick of love: Cant. 2.3.

Awake O North-winde, and come thou South, blow upon my garden, that the spices
thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his
pleasant fruit: Cant. 4.16: Ioh. 3.29. 1 Cor. 16.22.

2 Thou must for him forsake thine own people, and thy fathers house, (Psalm.
45.10.) Even as Leuy, who said unto his Father, and to his Mother, I have not
seen him, neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor know his own children:
Deu. 33.9: Mar. 10.29. Luke 14.26.33:17.32. Heb. 10.34.

Q. But where is Christ this our beloved to be found? Can. 1, 7.

A. Where two or three are gathered together in his name, there is he in the
midst of them, (Math. 18.20.) Therefore if thou know not (O thou fairest
among women) go thy way forth by the footesteps of the flock, and feed thy
kiddes besides the sheepheards tents: Cant. 1.8. Acts 10.6.

CHAP. IX. Of Gods hearing Prayers.
Q. WHat are the fruits of Gods Fatherly dispotion toward us his people?

A. One is that thou shall make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,
(Job 22.27.) In an acceptable time, and in the day of salvation, (Isa. 49.8.)
Thou shall call, and the Lord shall say, here I am, (Psa. 58.9.) At the voice
of thy cry, when he shall hear it, he will answer thee, (Isa, 30.19.) Yea,
it shall come to pass, that before you call he will answer, and whiles you
are yet speaking, he will hear: Isa. 65.24. Math. 18 19: Ierem. 29.12: Ioh. 4
10. Genesis 20.7.

For in my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God, he heard
my voice out of his Temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears,
(Psalm. 18.6.) And whiles Daniel was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel came
unto him, and said at the beginining of thy suppications, the commandment came
forth, and I am come to show thee the vision, (Dan. 9.20.) And so the Lord
answered the Angel, praying for Jerusalem, with good words, and comfortable
words: Zec. 1.13: Genesis 19.20, 21:20.17.24.12, etc. Exodus 2.23:8.12, etc.
12.30.9.33. 10.18.15.24, 25.17.11.32.9.10.33.17: Numb. 21.6, 7, 8:14.19, 20:
Joshua 10.12: 1 Samuel 1.27.7.9.12.18: 1 Kings 13.6.17.21:18.38: 2 Kings 1.9:6*
^7. 1 Chronicles. 4.10:2.20:12.30.27: Ezra 8.23: Psalm. 6.8: Iona. 2.10: Acts
4.31:10.4:12.5:16.25: Heb. 5.7.

Ob. I am sure there is no day wherein I do miss prayer, and yet I am never
the near.

A. You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, (James 4.3.) And your
iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good
things: Ier. 5.25.

Q. What is then required of a man that he may pray aright, and with assurance
of being heard?

A. 1 Concerning the person: and first that he be in Christ; who because he
prays not for the world, but for those the Father has given him, (John
17:9.) If ye abide in him, ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you:
Ioh. 15.7.

2 That he be righteous: the prayer of the righteouus avails much, (James
5.16.) For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open
to their prayers, ( 1 Pet. 3.12.

If ye regard wickedness in your heart, the Lord will not hear you, (Psalm.
66.18.) But if your heart condemn you not, then may you have confidence
toward God, and whatsoever you ask, you shall receive of him, because you
keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight, 1
John 3.21.

For the Lord is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the
righteous, (Prou. 15.29.) The fear of the wicked it shall come upon him, but
the desire of the Righteous shall be granted, Pro. 10.24.

Now because in many things we sin all, (Eccles. 7.20.) What prayer, and
supplication soever be made by any man, or by all the people Israel, which
shall know every man the plague of his own heart, then will God hear in
heaven, his dwelling place. 1 Kings 8.38: Psalm 145.19: Ioh. 15.7:1.3.22.
CONTRA. Iud. 10. 14.11.7: Isa. 59. 1. Ier. 3.4.7.16. Hos. 5.7.14. Micha 3.4.
Prou. 1.24.21.1^ Judges 11.7.

2 The thing we pray for must be good. For they that seek the Lord, she want
no good thing, (Psalm. 34.10.) F^^ what man is there of you, whom if his son^
ask bread, will he give him a stone, or if ask a fish, will he give him a
serpent? If then being evil know how to give good gif^ to your children, how
much more she your Father which is in heaven give go^^ things to them that ask
him: Mat. 7.9.

3 The manner must be according t^ Gods will. For this is the confidence the
we have in him, that if we ask an^ thing according to his will, he hearet^
us: 1 Ioh. 5.14.

Q. what is then the will of God concerning the manner of prayer; that so
praying we may obtain?

A. 1 You must ask in faith, nothing wauerering, for he that wauereth, is
like ^ wave of the sea, driven with the wind, an^ tossed; neither let not that
man think, that he shall receive any thing of the Lord, James 1.6.). But if
thou do commit thy ^ay unto the Lord, and trust in him, then shall he bring
it to pass: Psalm: 37.5.

2 In sincerity. For the Lord is nigh ^ll them that call upon him, to all that
call upon him in truth: Psalm. 145.18.

3 Prayer shall be available if it be ^ruent, (James 5.16.) Open thy mouth
^ide, and he will fill it, (Psalm. 81.10) ^ry aloud, and he shall hear thy
voice, Psalm. 55.17.) And if with Jacob thou ^rastle with God, thou as a Prince
shall ^aue power with God and man, and ^halt prevail Genesis 32.26: Hosea 12.4.
Exodus 32.10: Luke 11.5. Heb. 5.7.

4 Pray continually, ( 1 These. 5.17) even ^uery day, saying; Give us this day
our ^aly bread, (Mat. 6.11.) and without cea^ng, praying night and day, ( 2 Timothy 1.3.) ^ea, evening and morning, and at noone ^hen you pray, he shall
hear thy voice Psalm 55.17.

For Peter and James and John with the ^est, continued with one accord in
prayer, and supplication, (Acts 11.4.) And sudden^ there came a sound from
heaven, as of a rus^ing mighty wind, which filled all the hou^ where they were
sitting. And there appe^red unto them cloven tongues like as of fir^^ and it
sat upon each of them; and they we^^ all filled with the holy Ghost; and
began^ to speak with other tongues as the Spir^^ gave them utterance: Act.
2.2.9.2.3.

5, We must submit our selves vnt^ Gods will for the success; as di^ Christ,
who prayed, saying, O my Father if it be possible, let this cup pass from m^
nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou will (Math. 26.39.) and was heard in
that h^ feared: Hebr. 5.7.

6. With charity toward men* when ye stand praying, forgive; if you ha^^
ought against any, that your Father al^ which is in heaven may forgive you,
(Mar^ 11.24.) For with what measure you me^^ it shall be measured to you
again. Mat. 7.^

7 We must do all in the name (...) Christ: For through him we both have a^
access by one spirit unto the Father, (Ephesians 2.18.) In whose name, whatsoever
ye shall ask the Father, that will he do, that the Father may be glorified
in the Son: John 14.13.

Ob. All these things I have striuen for in prayer; but I am so cumbred with
sin, as may justly move the Lord to keep good things from me.

A Elias was a man subject to the like passion as we are, and he prayed
earnestly, that it might not rain, and it rained not: James 5.17.

Ob. That might be but a chance.

A. He prayed again, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth brought forth
her increase: James 5.18.

Ob. But what is that to me?

A. This was written for the generations to come, (Psalm. 102.18.) And there is
no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for the same Lord, over all, is
rich unto all that call upon him, (Romans 10.12.) For which shall every one that
is godly pray unto him, in a time when he may b^ found: Psalm. 32.6: John
17.20.

Q. What are the reasons of Gods hearing our prayers?

A. 1 Because he is your Father, and knows what things you have need of
before you ask him, Math. 6, 8: and 7.9.

2 The Angel of the covenant standing at the altar, having a golden censer,
there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the
prayers of all Saints upon the golden altar, which was before the throne. And
the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints, ascended up
before God, out of the Angels hand, Reuelat. 8.3.

For ye are not come unto the mount, that might be touched, and that burned
with fire, nor unto blackenesse and darkness, and tempest, and the sound of a
trumpet, and the voice of words, which voice, they that heard; entreated that
the word should not be spoken unto them any more: But ye are come to Jesus the
mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks
better things than that of Abel: Heb. 12.18.

Which Jesus has promised that if we shall ask the Father any thing in his
name, that he will pray unto the Father for us, (John 16.26.) By whose prayers,
our prayers also are sanctified: Mat. 23 19.

Q. Seeing God has thus promised to hear our prayers, what in the sense of
our wants must we do?

A. Having therefore boldness to enter into the holy place, by the blood of
Jesus, by a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the
veil, that is to say his flesh; and having an high Priest, over the house of
God, let us draw near, with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, (Heb.
10.19.) And be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer, and
supplication, with thanksgiving, let your rqeuests be made unto God: Phil. 4.6.

Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you, (James 4.8.) And come
boldly to the throne of grace, that ye may obtain mercy, to find grace, to
help in time of need Heb. 4.16: Mat. 7.7: Luke 11.9: 1 Timothy 2.8: 1 Pet. 2.4.
Col. 4.2: Job 8.5: Ephesians. 6.18. Isa. 65.16.

2 Saying unto God, hear the voice of my supplication, when I cry unto thee,
when I lift up my hand toward thy holy oracle, Psalm. 28.2. Let the words of my
mouth, and the meditations of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord my
strength, and my redeemer. Psalm. 19.14. Numb. 10.36. 1 King. 8.26.28.52.57. 1
Chro. 4.10. Psalm. 5.1.28.2.30.10.84.8.86.6.88.1.130.1.143.1. Isa. 37.17. Dan.
9.19. Mar. 14.36.

Ob. But I wanting a gift of prayer, how can I expect that GOD should hear me?

A. Likewise also, the spirit will help your infirmities. For though we know
not how to pray, as we ought, yet ihe spirit it self makes intercession for
us, with gronings, which cannot be uttered. But he that searches of the
hearts, knows what is the mind of the spirit; because he makes intercession
for the Saints, according to the will of God. Romans 8.26.

Q. When God has heard our prayers, what is then to be done?

A. Say, I love the Lord, because he has heard my voice, and my supplications;
because he has inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as
long as I live, Psalm. 116.1.

I said in mine have, I am cut off from before thine eyes; nevertheless, thou
heardest the voice of my supplication, when I cried unto thee, (Psalm. 31.22.)
In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with
strength in my soul, (Psalm. 138.3.) Thou have given me the desire of my heart,
and have not withdrawn from me the request of my lips: Psalm 21.2.10.17.

Praise waits for thee in Sion, and unto thee shall the vow be performed. O
thou that hear prayers, unto thee shall all flesh come, (Psalm. 65.1.)
Blessed be God which has not turned away our prayer, nor his mercy from us,
Psalm. 66.20: Ephesians. 3.20. Psalm. 66.16, 17. Deuteronomy. 4.7.

CHAP. X. God accepts his in their services.
Q. WHat other fruit can you show of Gods fatherly disposition toward us his
children?

A. He shall also be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, (Psalm.
51.19.) For these are good and acceptable in the sight of God, our Savior, ( 1 Timothy 2.3.) And as an odor of a sweet smell: Phi. 4.18.

For Noah built and altar, and the Lord smelt a sweet savor, (Genesis 8.20.)
Moreover, God had respect unto Abel, and his offering, (Genesis 4.4.) And so shall
the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the
days of old, and as in former years: Mal. 3.4: Judges 13.23. Isa. 4.2.

Ob. I can perform no work worthy of Gods acceptance.

A. If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man
has, and not according to that he has not, ( 2 Cor. 8.12.) As well as the
widow with her two mites, more than the rich, casting in of their abundance:
Luke 21.1. Mark 12.44.

Ob. O my soul, thou have said unto the Lord, thou art my Lord, my goodness
extends not to thee; but to the Saints: Psalm. 16.2.

A. I was hungry, and you gave me meat, I was thirsty, and you gave me
drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in; naked, and you clothed me: I
was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came unto me. For
verily I say unto you, in as much as you have done it, unto one of the least of
these my brethren, you have done it unto me, (Mat. 25.35.) And whosoever shall
receive but such a little child, receives me: Math. 18.5.

Q. What may this teach us?

A. Therefore as living stones, being built up a spiritual house, an holy
priesthood, let us offer up spiritual sacrifice, acceptable to God, by Jesus
Christ. 1 Pet. 2.5. And to do good, and to distribute, forget not; because
with such sacrifices God is well pleased, (Heb. 13.16.) For he that in these
things serves Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved of men: Romans 14.18.
Col. 3.17. 2 Cor. 9.7.

Ob. If God do accept us in our weldoing, whence then this complaint? We have
fasted, and God sees not; we have afflicted our souls, and he takes no
knowledge: Isa. 58.3.

A. If they did well, should they not be accepted? (Genesis 4.7.) When they fasted
and mourned, did they at all fast unto me? And when they did eat and drink,
did they not eat for themselves, and drink for themselves? Zech. 7.5.

Behold, in the day of their fast, they find pleasure, and exact all their
labors. Behold, they fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of
wickedness, (Isa. 58.4.) Thus they have brought an offering, and should I
accept this at their hands, says the Lord: Mal. 1.13.

For the plowing of the wicked is sin, (Prou. 21.4.) And thereir sacrifice is
abomination, how much more when they bring it with a wicked mind? Pro. 21.27.
Ierem. 6.20, 14.12. Isa. 1.11.58.5. Amos 5.21.5.25. Isa. 66.3. Psalm 50.9.
Hosea 6.6. 1 Cor 7.19. Psalm. 40.6. Mark 12.33. James 1.22. Luke 11.41. Ier.
7.22. Hos. 4.19. Hag. 2.11. Mal. 1.7.13.

CHAP. XI. There is a reward for the righteous.
Q. But suppose we have Gods acceptance; is this all we shall have for our
well doing?

A. He that sows righteousness, shall also have a sure reward: (Prou.
11.18.) And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own
labor. 1 Cor. 3.8. Whether he be bond or free: Ephesians. 6.8. So that he which
follows after righteousness and mercy, finds life, righteousness and
honor, (Prou. 21.21.) For behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and
his arm shall rule for him; Behold, his reward is with him, and his work
before him, (Isa. 40.10.) So that a man shall say. verily there is a reward for
the righteous, verily he is a God that judges the earth; Psalm. 58.11. Prou.
19.8.24.4.21.21. Job. 34.7, etc.

Therefore Vzziah so long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper, ( 2
Chro. 26.5.) Hezechiah also wrought that which was good and right and true
before the Lord, and prospered, 2 Chro. 31.20:17.3. Numb. 25.11. Math. 26.13:
Exodus 1.21. Zech. 3.7. Genesis 22.16. Ierem. 35.18: Heb. 11.5. Genesis
18.17.19.24.12. with 26.2 Chro. 14.7, etc. 2.13, 18: Psalm. 18.20.

Ob. Much good is done which God may neither see nor observe.

A. The Lord searches the heart, and tries the reins, even to give every man
according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings: (Ierem.
17.10.) For he is the great and mighty God, the Lord ^f host is his name,
great in counsel, and mighty in work; for his eyes are open, upon all the
ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and
according to the fruit of his doings, (Ier. 32.18.) And do run to and fro,
throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong, in the behalf of them
whose heart is perfect toward him, 2 Chronicles. 16.9: Psalm. 111.5.

Ob. But may not God forget our weldoing?

A. God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which ye
have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the Saints, and do
minister: Heb. 6.10.

For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant, (Psalm. 105.42.)
And when they that feared the Lord, and speak often one to another, the Lord
hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for
them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name Mal. 3.16.

I have waited long and yet hau^ no reward.

A. Yet be not weary in weldoing, for in due season you shall reap, if you
faint not Gal. 6.9.

For how ever the son of man be a^ one gone into a far country, to recei^^
unto himself a kingdom; yet will he return, (Luke 19.11.) And come in the
glory of his Father, with his Angels, and the^ he shall reward every man
according to hi^ works: Mat. 16.27.

Therefore turn thou to thy God, keep mercy, and judgment, and wait on thy
Go^ continually: Hos. 12.6.

Ob. As for works of mercy, wherein I do part with my goods, the more good I
do for others, the less good remains to my self.

A. There is that scatters, and yet increases: The liberal soul shall be
made fat, and he that waters, shall be watered also himself: (Prou.
11.24.25.) He which sows bountifully, shall reap bountifully, ( 2 Cor.
9.6.) Give, and it shall be given unto you, good measure, pressed down shaken
together, running over: Luke 6.38.

For God is able to make all grace to abound toward you, that you having
sufficiency in all things, may abound in every good work. As it is written, He
has dispersed abroad, he has given to the poor, his righteousness remains
for ever: 2 Cor. 9.8. Psalm. 112.9. 1 Kings 17.16. Isa. 32.8. Psalm 41.1.

Q. Why will God thus reward our weldoing in this kind?

A Because the administration of this service, not only supplieth the want of
the Saints; but is abundant also by many thanksgiving unto God: whiles by the
experiment of this minsteration, they glorify God, for your professed
subjection unto the Gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto
them: 2 Cor. 9.12. Math. 5.16.

Q. What is the use of this?

A. 1. To confute the scorner, for what man is he then, who drinks up
scorning like water which goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and
w^keth with wicked men? For he says profits a man nothing, that he shou^^
delight himself with God, (Job 34.7. And what profit is it, that we have kept
h^ ordinances, and that we have walked mour^fully before the Lord of hosts,
which call the proud happy, and say, that suc^ as work wickedness, are set
up; yea, the^ that tempt God, are even delivered. Where as they that fear me,
shall be mine, sait^ the Lord of hosts, in that day when I ma^^ up my Jewels;
and I will spare them, as man spares his own son that serves him Then shall
ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked; between him that
serves God, and him that serves him not: Mal. 3.14.

Thefore, hearken unto me ye men of understanding; far be it from God that he
should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should commit iniquity.
For the work of man shall be render unto him, and cause every man to find
according to his ways: Job 34.10, Mal. 2.17.

2 Pray, saying; Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my
^ood deeds, that I have done for the house ^f my God, and for the offices
thereof: (Neh. 13.14.) Do thou O Lord recompense my works, and give unto me
a full reward: (Ruth 2.12.) And let thy mercy be upon me, according as I hope
in thee: Psalm. 33.22.

3 Be strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak; for your work shall
be rewarded: ( 2 Chronicles. 15.7.) And as every man has received the gift, even so
minister ^he same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of
God: ( 1 Pet. 4.10.) Because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall bless
thee in all thy works, and in all that thou put thine hand unto: (Deuteronomy.
15.10.) And shall also recompense thee at the resurrection of the just: Luke
14.14. Deuteronomy: 14.29. Gal. 6.10. Eccles 11.1. Hebrews 13.2. Colloss. 3.24. Prou.
3.28. 1 Timothy 6.17. Isa. 3.10.

Q. Among other good works, show me how the works of charity must be done,
that so I neither neglecting the work, nor fail in the manner of doing them,
may be sure not to faile^ my reward?

A. Take heed, that you do not your alm^ before men to be seen of them;
otherwi^^ you have no reward of your Father which in Heaven: But when thou
do thi^ alms, etc. let not thy left hand know wh^ thy right hand does,
that thine alm^ may be in secret, and thy Father which sees in secret,
himself shall reward the openly: Math. 6.1.16. And whatsoeue^ you do, do it
heartily as to the Lord, a^^ not unto men, knowing that of the Lord y^^ shall
receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the Lord Christ. Col. 3.23.

2 He that receives a Prophet, in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a
Pr^phes reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a
righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. An^ whosoever shall give
to drink unto one (...) these little ones a cup of cold water, only i^ the
name of a Disciple, verily, I say vnt^ you, he shall in no wise lose his
reward: Math. 10.41.

Ob. I see many in want, neither Prophets, nor righteous men, but my enemies,
and no lovers of goodness; what in this case must I do?

A. If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty,
give him water to drink: for thou shall heap coals of fire upon his head, and
the Lord shall reward thee, (Prou. 25.21) And cast thy bread upon waters, for
thou shall find it after many days: Eccles. 11.1: Luke 6.27. Mat. 5.44. Psalm.
35.13. 2 Samuel 1.11, 12 Acts 7.60.

Q. What reward shall be to such, as are fruitless in good works?

A. As he that gives to the poor shall not lack, so he that hides his
eyes shall have many a curse: (Prou. 28.27.) And he shall have judgment
without mercy, that shows no mercy, James 2.13.

And therefore say ye, woe be unto the wicked, it shall be ill with him, for the
reward of his hands shall be given him, (Isa. 3.11.) For I say unto you, that
unto every one which has, shall be given; and from him that has not, even
that he has shall be taken away from him: Luke 19.26. Prou. 11.26,
27.21.13.11.31.17.5. Isa. 29.1.

CHAP. XII. God will teach his in their ways.
Q. WHat is the fourth privilege, God bestows upon his children?

A. That he will instruct and teach them in the way that they should go, and
will Guide them with his eye: (Psalm. 32.8.) The meek will he guide in
judgment, the meek will he teach his way; what man is he that fears the
Lord, him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose? (Psalm. 25.9.12.)
And will be their guide even unto death: Psalm. 48.14. Exo: 33.14 Genesis 46.4.
Nehe. 9.20. Psalm. 37.23. Ioh. 10.3 4.

Thus the Lord led his people forth by the right way, that they might go to a
City of habitation, (Psalm. 107.7.) And he brought them to the border of his
sanctuary, which his right hand had purchased: Psalm. 78.54. Deuteronomy 1.31. Psalm.
78.52, 53. Exodus 13.21.22.40.38.

Ob. Notwithstanding I am very subject to miss my way?

A. Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, this is the way, walk
ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left:
(Isa. 30.21.) I will bring the blind by a way that they know not, I will lead
them in the paths that they have not known; I will mak^ darkness light
before them, and crooked things straight: (Isa. 42.16.) For I am the light of
the world; he that follows me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
the light of life: John 8.12.12.46.

Q. Is this blessing common to all both good and bad?

A. The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his ways; but the wicked,
shall fall by his own wickedness, (Prou. 11.5.) For they wait for light; but
lo it is darkness; for brightness, but they walk in darkness; They grope
for the wall, like the blind, and grope as one without eyes; they stumble at
the noone day, as in the twilight, they are in solitary places, as dead men:
Isa. 59.9.

Q. What may these things teach us?

A. 1 To pray, saying; show me thy way O Lord; teach me thy paths, lead me in
thy truth, and teach me; for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I
wait all the day (Psalm. 25.4.) Lead me O Lord in thy righteousness, because
of mine enemies, make thy ways straight before my face: (Psalm. 5 8.) And if I
have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee. For
wherein shall it be known here, that I have found grace in thy sight? Is it
not in that thou go with me? Exodus 33.13.16. Psalm. 86.11.27.11.31.3.

2 To ponder the paths of thy feet, that thy ways may be ordered aright,
Pro. 4.26.

3 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths: Prou. 3.6.

Q. When we have found God to be his words master in this, what is to be done?

A. Say, I will bless the Lordw, ho has given me counsel, my reins also
teach me in the night season, (Psalm. 16.7.) He restores my soul, he leads
me in the paths of righteousness, for his names sake: (Psalm. 23.3.) For a
man's goings being of the Lord, how can he then understand his own ways; Pro.
20.24.

CHAP. XIII. The guard of Angels.
Ob. NOtwithstanding, which way so ever I go, many dangers do attend me.

A. Therefore God has added another privilege; for the Angels, of the Lord,
shall incampe round about thee, to keep thee in all thy ways; they shall
bear thee up in their hands, that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone:
(Psalm. 91.11.) For are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister,
for their sakes, which shall be heirs of salvation? Hebr. 1.14. Exodus
32.^3.34.2.

Behold therefore the mountains full of horses, and chariots of fire, round
about Elisha, 2 Kings 6.17.1.19.5. Mark 1.13. Luke 22.43. Genesis 19.10. Acts
27.23.5.19.12.7.10.3.

Q. What use make you hereof?

A. It admonishes the wicked, to take heed they despise not one of the least
of Gods children: because that in heaven their Angels do always behold the
face of their Father which is in heaven: Math. 18.10.

CHAP. XIV. All things work for good.
Ob. IF God do thus guide and guard his children, whence is it, that so many
crosses do betide us in our way?

A. From God, by whose providence we know that all things work together for
Good, to them that love God, to them that are called according to his purpose:
Romans 8.28.

Q. Will other men's sins in seeking my hurt do me good?

A. Yea, for how ever they (as did the brethren of Joseph) think evil against
us, yet God means it unto good, as then, to bring to pass, by saving much
peope alive Genesis 50.20.

Q. Their sins turned to the relief of their bodies; but will my own
sins, turn to the good of my soul?

A. Yea, For Onessimus departed for a season, that he might be received for
ever; not then as a servant, but a brother, beloved both in the flesh, and in
the Lord, Phile. 15. Moreover, through the sharp contention of Paul, and
Barnabas, whereby they departing asunder one from the other, many were edified.
Acts 15.37.

CHAP. XV. Comfort against death.
Ob. IF these be the privileges of the Saints, whosoever then is joined to all
the living, there is hope: (Eccles. 9.4.) But what man is he that lives, and
shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?
(Psalm. 89.48.) Is not the grave the house appointed for all the living? (Job
30.23.) And will death also work for our good? Job 34.14. Eccles
3.18.11.8.9.10. 1 Kings 2.10. Acts 13.36. John 8.52. Genesis 3.19. 2 Samuel 3.38.
Job 9.25.14.5. Psa. 90.10.103.15.144.4.39.12.39.4, 5. 1 Chronicles: 29.15. Isa.
40.6. Prou: 19.20. Numb: 23.10. Acts 22 9.

A. Man indeed is not Lord over the Spirit, to retain the Spirit, neither has
he power in the day of death: (Eccles: 8.8.) Yet the day of death is better
than the day of ones birth, (Eccles. 7.1.) For I heard a voice from heaven,
saying unto me, write; Blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord, from
henceforth, yea says the Spirit that they may rest from their labors: (Revel
14.13.) For the wicked have there c^ase^ from their tyranny, and there they
that labored valiantly are at rest: The prisoners rest together, and hear not
the vo^ce of the oppressor, and the servant is free from his master: (Job
3.17.) Peace shall then come, they shall rest in their beds, every one that
walks before him. Isa. 57.2.

2 Though they die, yet their works die not; but do follow them: (Revel.
14.13.) And when the wicked by death are driven away in his wickedness, yet
the righteous has hope in his death: Prou. 14.32. Rom: 14.8. Prou: 11.7.

Q. Why can these dead bones live? Ezech. 37.3.

A. Thy dead men shall live together, with my dead body shall they arise: (Isa*
26 19.) For since by man came death, by man came the resurrection of the dead:
And as in Adam all dye, so in Christ shall all be made alive. ( 1 Cor 15.21.)
And therefore we have hope toward God, that the resurrection shall be of the
just, and unjust: Acts 24.15. Ezech. 37.5. Psalm. 90.3.

Q. There is no article of faith, does more stagger me than this of the
resurrection; and therefore I pray help to confirm me in it.

A. Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are
in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth: John 5.28.

Now that the dead are raised up, even Moses shows at the bush, when he
calls the Lord, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;
for he is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto him:
Luke 20.37.

Why then should it be thought an incredible thing with you, that God should
raise the dead? Acts 26.8.

Q. Make the certainty of the resurrection further to appear, by some examples
of such as have been raised up from the dead.

A. The son of the Shunamite being dead, was by the Prophet Elisha, restored
unto his mother alive: 2 Kings 4.32. A dead man also being let down into the
sepulcher of Elisha, he revived, and stood upon his feet. ( 2 Kings 13.21.)
And when Christ with a loud voice, said, unto Lazarus arise and come forth;
then he that was dead, came forth bound hand and foot, with the grave clothes:
(John 11.43.) Likewise at the death of Christ, the graves were opened, and many
of the bodies of the Saints which slept, arose and came out of the graves after
his resurrection, and went into the holy City, and appeared unto many, (Math.
27.52.) Remember also that Jesus Christ, made of the seed of DAVID, was raised
again from the dead, according to my Gospel: 2 Timothy 2.8.

Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you,
that there is no resurrection from the dead? 1 Cor. 15.12.1.15.4. Acts 10.40.
Reue^ 1.18. Acts 13.30. Gal. 1.1. Acts 26.23.

Q. What does it concern me, th^^ Christ is raised from the dead?

A. Very much; for Christ being r^sen from the dead* is become the first fruit
of them that sleep, ( 1 Cor. 15.20.) A^ this is a faithful saying, that if we
be de^ with him, we shall also live with him, 2 Timothy 2.11. For God that has
raised up the Lord, will raise up us by his own power ( 1 Cor. 6.14.) who by
him do believe i^ God, that raised him up from the dead, an^ gave him glory
that your faith and hop^ might be in God: 1 Pet. 1.2^. 2 Corin. ^ 14. Romans 8.11.

Ob. But death is called the King (...) terrors: (Job. 18.14.) who then ca^
overcome it?

A. I am (says Christ) the resurrection and the life, he that believes in me,
thoug^ he were dead, yet shall he live, (John 11 25.) I will ransom them
from the power of the grave, I will redeem them from death O death, I will be
thy plague! O grave, will be thy destruction,! The sting of death sin, and
the strength of sin is the Law; ^t thanks be to God, which has given ^s
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ, Cor. 15.55 Psalm. 68.20. Hosea 13.14.

Ob. I may be drowned in the sea, and ^euoured of fishes.

A. The sea shall give up the dead which ^ein it, and death and hell, shall
deliver ^p the dead which were in them, Revel. 20.^3.

Ob. Though I should be buried in ^he earth, yet amidst so many bodies,
^onsumed to dust, and so confusedly ^ixed, my body may be lost.

A. This is the Fathers will which has ^ent me, that of all which he has
given me, should loose nothing, but should raise it up ^gaine at the last day:
Ioh. 6.39.

Ob. The same bodies for number that dyed, may be raised from the dead; but
not the same in identitie of bodies.

A. I know my Redeemer lives, and that he shall stand the latter day upon the
earth, and though after my skin, wor^ destroy this body, yet in my flesh
shall see God; whom I shall see for my self, a^ mine eyes shall behold, and
not another though my reins be consumed within m^ Job 19.25. John 11.24.

Q. How are the dead raised up? and wi^ what bodies do they come? 1 Cor. 15.35.

A. Thou fool, that which thou sowest not quickened except it dye, and that
whi^^ thou sowest, thou sowest not that body the shall be, but bare grain, it
maybe cha^^ wheat, or some other grain. But God given it a body, as it
pleases him, and to every se^ his own body, etc. So also is the resurrecti^^
from the dead. It is sown in corruption, is raised in incorruption; It is
sown in di^honor, it is raised in glory; it is sowne^ weakness, tt is raised
in power: it sowne^ natural body, it is raised a spiritual bod^ 1 Corin.
15.36.

Q. You say that all shall be raised; wherein then will stand the difference
between the Elect, and reprobate at that day?

A. As with Pharaohes chief butler, and chief baker, whose heads were both
lifted up; but the one unto his butlership, the other unto the gallows, to be
hanged up, (Genesis 40.20.) So all both good and bad, shall come forth. They that
have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil,
unto the resurrection of damnation: Ioh. 5.29. Dan. 12.2.13.

Q. What shall become of them, who shall be found alive at the general
resurrection?

A. Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpe; for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall
be changed: 1 Cor. 15.51.

Q. Now I know that we shall rise again in the resurrection, at the last day:
Ioh. 11.24. What therefore would you thence infer?

A. 1 Concerning them that sleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others without
hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also,
which sleep in Jesus, w^ God bring with him, 1 These. 4.13.

2 Though I walk in the valley, of t^^ shadow of death, I will fear no
evil; for thou art with me, thy ^od, and thy sta^ comfort me: (Psalm 23.4.)
Therefo^^ also my heart is glad, my glory reioycet^ my flesh also shall rest in
hope: for thou wi^^ not leave my soul in hell. Psalm. 16.9.

3. Let us therefore which have the fir^ fruits of the spirit groan within
our selue^ waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redem^tion of our bodies: Romans
8.23.

4 Let none of us live or die to our selue^ for whether we live, we live unto
the Lord, or whether we dye, we dye unto the L^^^, For to this purpose, Christ
dye^ (...) and revived, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and living,
(Rom 14.7.) Wherefore labor we, that whether present, or ahsent we may be
accepted o^ him: 2 Cor. 5.9.

Q. When this dust returns to the earth, (Eccle. 12.7.) who knows the
spirit of a man that goes upward, and the spirit o^ the beast that goes
downward to the earth: Eccles. 3.21.

A. We know that if this earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we
have a building of God, an house not made with hands, but eternal in the
heavens, ( 2 Cor. 5.1.) For the spirit shall return to God, that gave it,
(Eccles. 12.7.) and shall be with Christ in Paradise, (Luke 23.43.) And with
Lazarus in Abraham's bosom: Luke 16.22.

Q. How stand you affected with this?

A. I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with
Christ, which is far better, (Pbil. 1.23.) For in this we groan earnestly,
desiring to be clothed upon with our house, which is from heaven; if so be that
being clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this
tabernacle, do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but
clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life ( 2 Cor. 5.2.)
Therefore we are always confident; knowing that whilst we are at home in
the body, we are absent from the Lord, (for we walk by faith, and not by
sight) we are confident I say, and willing, rather to be absent from the body,
and to be present with the Lord, 2 Corin. 5.6. Math. 17.4.

CHAP. XVI. Of the last judgment.
Ob. WHat we shall have after death I cannot say, but in these days of my
vanity I have seen; there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness,
and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness: (Ecces.
7.15.) yea, the tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are
secure; for into their hand God brings abundantly, (Job 12.6.) Behold, these
are the ungodly, who prosper in the world, they increase in riches, verily I
have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence: For all the
day long I have been plagued and chastened every morning: Psalm. 73.12, 13. Ier.
5.27.12. 1. Eccl. 8.14.

A. God has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world, in
righteousness, by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given
assurance unto all men, in that he has raised him from the dead. (Acts 17.31.)
So that, we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ. (Romans 14.10.)
Who shall judge his people. (Heb. 10.30.) Unto whom they also must come to give
an account. 1. Pet. 4.5. Heb. 9.27. Psalm. 96.13.98.9. Eccles. 11.9.

Ob. Where is the promise of his coming? For since the Fathers fell a sleep,
all things continue, as they were from the beginning? 2, Pet. 3.4.

A. This you are willingly ignorant of, that by the Word of GOD, the Heavens
were of old, and the earth standing out of the water, and in the water, whereby
the world that then was, being ouerflowed with water perished. But the Heavens,
and the earth which are now, by the same word, are kept in store, reserved unto
fire against the day of Judgment, and perdition of ungodly men.

But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord
as ^ thousand years, and a thousand years a one day. The Lord is not slack
concerning his promise (as some men cou^ slacknesse) but is long suffering, to
us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to
repentance. 2. Pet. 3.5.

Q. Tell us then when these thing shall be, and what shall be the signs, o^
the end of the World. Mat. 24.3.

A. 1 Before the end come, many shall come in CHRIST'S name, saying, I am
CHRIST, and many false Prophets shall arise. Mat. 24.5.11.

2 The day shall not come, except there come a falling away first (2. These.
2.3.) and many be deceived. Mat. 24.5.11.

3 That man of sin shall first be revealed; the son of perdition, who
opposes, and exalts himself, above all that is called GOD, or that is
worshipped. 2. These. 2.3.4.

4 You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars: for Nation shall rise
against Nation, and Kingdom against Kingdom, but the end shall not be yet.
(Mat. 24.6.7.)

5 Because iniquity shall be increased, the love of many shall wax cold, Mat.
24.12.

6 This Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a
witness unto all Nations, and then shall the end come. Mat. 24.14.

7 When the fullness of the Gentiles is come in, all Israel shall be saved; as
it is written. The deliverer shall come out of Sion, and shall turn away
ungodliness from Jacob, Romans 11.25.

8 As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the
Son of Man; they did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given
in marriage, until the day that Noah went into the Arc, and the Flood came,
and destroyed them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did
eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the
same day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire, and brimstone from
heaven, and destroyed them all; even thus shall it be in the day, when the
Son of man is revealed. (Luke 17.26.) And when they shall say peace, and
safety, then sudden destruction comes upon them; as travel upon a woman with
child, (1. These. 5.3.) Or as a thief by night, 2. Pet. 3.10. Revel. 16.15.
Math. 24.38.

Now learn a parable of the Fig tree, when his branch is yet tender, and
puts forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh. (Math. 24.32.)

And when ye see a cloud rise out of the West, strait way ye say a shower
comes, and so it is. And when ye see the South wind blow, ye say, that it
will be hot, and it comes to pass. (Luke 12.54.) So likewise ye, when ye
shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the door. (Math.
24.33.) But of the day and hour, knows no man, no not the Angels of heaven,
but my Father only, Math. 24.36. Eccles. 8.5.7. Act. 1.7.

Q. What shall be the manner of CHRIST'S coming to judgment?

A. He shall send his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet, and they shall
gather together, his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven, to the
other. (Math. 24.31) Then the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
the elements shall melt away with fervent heat: the earth also, with the works
that are therein shall be burned up, (2. Pet. 3.10.) And there shall be a
great earthquake; the son shall become black, as sackcloth, with hair, and
the Moon become as blood, and the Stars of Heaven shall full to the earth,
and the heavens shall depart as a scr^ule. Revel 6.12.

And there shall be signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars,
and the Sea, and the waves roaring: the powers of the Heaven shall be shaken,
and then shall they see the sign of the son of Man coming in the Clouds
with power, and great glory. (Luke 21.25.) Who shall be revealed from heaven in
flaming fire, (2. These. 1.7.) With ten thousands of his Saints, in glory, and
all his holy Angels with him. (Mat. 25.31.) Thousands thousands, shall minister
unto him; and ten thousand times, ten thousands shall stand before him: and the
Judgment Seat shall be set, and the books opened. (Dan. 7.9.) And every eye
shall see him Reu. 1.7.

Q. How shall men, in the since o^ these things, stand affected?

A. Upon the earth there shall be distress of Nations, with perplexity: men's
hearts shall fail them for fear, and for looking after those things which
shall then come on the earth. (Luke 21.26.) And al^ the kindreds of the Earth
shall wail because of him. Revel. 1.7.

And in those days shall men seek Death, and shall not find it; and shall
desire to dye, and death shall fly from them. (Reu. 9.6.) Then the Kings of
the earth, and the great men, and every bondsman, and every free man, shall hide
themselves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains, and shall say to
the Mountains, and Rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that
sits upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of
his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand? Revel. 6.15. Isa.
2.19.13.7.33.14. Hos. 10.8.

Q. But shall the godly be thus perplexed at the beholding of these things?

A. Beloved if our heart condemn us not, then shall we have confidence toward
God. (1. Ioh. 3.21.) For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of
Power, of Love, and of a sound Mind. (2, Tim. 1.7.) And therefore, when these
things begin to come to pass, then shall we look up, and lift up our heads,
because our Redemption draws nigh. (Luke 21.28.) For CHRIST was once offered
to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him, shall he appear
the second time without sin unto salvation, (Heb. 9.28.) And herein is our
love made perfect, that we may have boldness at the day of Judgment, because
as he is, so are we in the World: Ioh. 1.4.17, 18. Romans 10.11.

Q. When Christ is set down upon his throne of glory, what is the first work
he shall do?

A. He shall separate the sheep from the Goats; and he shall set the sheep on
his right hand, and the goats on his left, (Mat. 25, 32.) Among whom, there
shall be two in one bed; one shall be taken, and the other left. Two women shall
be grinding together; the one shall be taken and the other left. Two men shall
be in the field, the one shall be taken, and the other left. Luke 17 34.

Q. What shall follow upon this separation?

A. Such as have followed CHRIST in the Regeneration, when the Son of Man
shall sit in the Throne of his glory; they also shall sit upon twelve thrones;
judging the twelve tribes of Israel, (Mat. 19.28.) Know ye not also that the
Saints shall judge the Angels? 1. Cor. 6.3.

Q. What are the things whereof Judgment shall be given?

A. GOD shall bring every work into Judgment with every secret thing, whether
it be good or whether it be evil, (Eccl. 12.14.) Moreover I say unto you, that
for every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an account thereof
in the day of Judgment. For by their words they shall be justified, and by
their words they shall be condemned. Matthew. 12, 36. Ioh. 3.18. Jude, v. 15.

Q. What is the evidence which shall be produced?

A. He shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove by the
hearing of his ears, (Isa. 11.3.) but by the Books which shall be then
opened, (Revel. 20.12.) their Consciences also bearing witness, and their
thoughts accusing one another or excusing. Romans 2.15.

Q. What are the rules according t^ which CHRIST shall judge.

A. 1. As many as have sinned with out law, shall perish without law and ^ many
as have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law. Romans 2.12.

2. GOD shall judge the secrets of men by JESUS CHRIST, according to m^ gospel
(Romans 2.16.) The words also which CHRIST has spoken, shall judge them i^ the
latter day. Ioh. 12.48. Iam. 2.12.

Q. What is the sentence it self which CHRIST shall pronounce?

A. He shall say unto them on his righ^ hand, come ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the word. Then
sha^ he say unto them on his left hand, Depar^ from me ye Cursed, into
everlasting fire prepared for the Devil, and his Angels (Math. 25.34.) And
unto his servants h^ shall say, bind them hand and foot, (Mat. 22.13.) and
cast you these unprofitable servants into outer darkness. Math. 25.30.

Q. What shall be the issue of this sentence?

A. God will then render to every one according to his deeds. To them who by
patient, continuance in well doing, seek glory, and honor, and immortality;
eternal life. But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth;
but obey unrighteousness; indignation, and wrath tribulation, and anguish upon
every soul of man, that does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.
But glory, and honor, and peace to every man that works good, to the Jew
first, and also to the Gentile. Romans 2.7. 2. Cor. 5.10. Mat. 25.46.

Q. What may the consideration of these things teach us?

A. 1. Rejoice O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the
days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of
thine eyes, but know thou that for all these things GOD will bring thee into
judgment Eccles. 11.9.

2. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of
persons ough^ ye to be in all holy conversation, and godl^nes? Looking for and
hasting, unto the coming of the day of the Lord. And seein^ ye look for such
things, be diligent, the ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and
blameless. 2. Pet. 3.11, 12, 14.

And seeing the day of the LORD shall come as a Thief in the night (1. These.
5.2.) Blessed are those Servants whom the Lord when he comes shall fir^
watching, (Luke 12.37.) Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be
counted worthy to escape all things, which shall come to pass, and to stand
before the Son of man. Luke 21.36. 1. These. 5.4 Reu. 3, 11.16.15. Mar. 25.19.
2. These. 13.5.

3 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both
bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the
Councels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise with God, (1. Cor.
4.5.) And say not, I will recompense evil; but wait on the Lord, and he shall
save thee. Pro. 20.22. Mat. 7.1. Eccl. 3.17. Romans 12.19.

CHAP. XVII. Of Eternal Life.
Q. YOu have said that after the day of Judgment, GOD will give Eternal life
unto his children: But is ^here any certainty thereof?

A. This is the promise that he has ^romised unto us, even Eternal life; and
^his life is in his Son: (Ioh. 1.2.25.1.5.11.) Unto whom he has given power
over all flesh, that he should give Eternal life, to as many as GOD his Father
has given him: (Ioh. 17.2.) That whosoever lives, and believes in him should
never die, (Job. 11.26.) For this corruptible, shall put on incorruption, and
this mortal shall put on immortality. (1. Cor. 15.53.) That as sin had
^aigned unto death, even so might Grace ^aigne, through Righteousness, unto
E^ernall Life, by JESUS CHRIST our Lord. Romans 5.21. Ioh. 6.40.47.^ 14.15. Romans
6.9.6.23. Heb. 9.12.^ 24, Reu. 20.6. Mark. 16.19. Psalm. 133, ^ Genesis 5.24. 2.
King. 2.11. Pro. 14.2^ 15.24.

Q. Whereunto shall we be the like?

A. We shall then be as the Angels GOD. (Mat. 22.30.) And be made comfortable
to the Image of his Son. (Ro^ 8.29.) When he shall first have change our vile
bodies, and made them like vn^ his glorious body. (Phil. 3.21.) For as the
earthly, such are they that are earthly and as is the heavenly, such are they
the are heavenly. And as we have borne t^ image of the earthly, we shall also
bear the image of the heavenly: (1. Cor. 15 48. Having bodies shining as the
brigh^nesse of the Firmament, and as the starre^ (Dan. 12.3.) Yea as the Sun
for ev^^ and ever. Matthew. 13.43. Exodus 3^ 30.35.

Q What manner of dwelling sha^ we then have?

A. Full glorious things are spoken of this City of GOD. (Psalm. 87.3.) For it
is such a City, as Abraham looked for, whose builder and maker is GOD. (Heb.
11.10.) The same is a great City, having the glory of GOD: whose light is like
unto a stone most precious: even like a Jasper stone, clear as Crystal. It
has a wall great, and high, with twelve Gates, and at the Gates twelve Angels.
And the wall of the City has twelve foundations, and the City lies four
square; and the length is as large as the breadth, twelve thousand furlongs:
and the length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal. And the
building of the wall it is Jasper, and the City pure gold, like unto clear
glass; and the foundations of the wall of the City, are garnished with all
manner of precious stones. Revel. 21.10. etc.

Q. What good company shall we there have?

A. 1 All the faithful: for we shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
in the Kingdom of Heaven. Maht. 8.11. Luke 13.28.

2 CHRIST; with whom we she appear in glory, (Col. 3.4.) and she for ever be
with the Lord, (1. These. 4.17^ who dyed for us, that whether we awake or
sleep, we should live together with him (1. These. 5.10.) And therefore he
gone to prepare a place for us; who w^ come again, and receive us unto himself
to the end, that where he is there we m^ be also, (Job. 14.3.) to behold his
glor^ Ioh. 17.24.12.26.

3 GOD himself: for I heard great voice from Heaven, saying, behol^ the
Tabernacle of GOD is with man; an^ he will dwell with them: (Revel. 21.3.^ Who
shall be as Moses, unto whom the Lord spoke face, to face, as a man speaket^ to
his friend: (Exodus 33.11. (Matthew* 5.8.

Q. But is this house large enough to hold so much company?

A. In my Fathers house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have tol^
you. I go to prepare a place for you. Ioh* 14.2.

Q. Shall we then, and there be subject to any more misery?

A. The voice of weeping shall be heard no more there, nor the voice of crying.
(Isa. 65* 19.) For God shall wipe all tears from your eyes, (Reu. 21.4.) You
shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more, neither shall the son light on you
nor any heat. (Revel. 7.16.) For there is the tree of life, the leaves
whereof, are for the healing of the nations, and there shall be no more curse.
Reu. 22.2. Isa. 54, 4. Revel. 7.17, 14.13. Heb. 4, 6.

Q. Shall we then have the benefit of all our earthly comforts, and delights,
we now enjoy?

A. In the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, Math.
22.30.

Moreover there is no temple there, (Reu. 21.22.) they need no candle, neither
light of the Sun. (Revel. 22.25.) The Sun shall be no more, a light by day,
neither for brightness, shall the Moon give light unto them. Isa. 60.19.

Q. What then shall our provision be?

A. Since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the
ear, neither has the eye seen what GOD has prepared for them that waits
for him. (Isa. 64.4.) For the Lord GOD Almighty and the Lamb are the Templ^ in
it, (R^u. 21.22.) Who also shall giu^ them light, (R^u. 22.5.) and shall be
their glory, (Isa. 60.19.) And the^ shall be abundantly satisfied with the
fatness of his house, and shall be made t^ drink of the Rivers of his
pleasures. (Psalm 36.8.) For in his presence is fullness of joy, and at his
right hand, there are pleasures for evermore. Psalm. 16.11.17.15 Revel. 22.1.2.
1. Cor. 2.9.2.12.2.

Ob. This were a large Patrimony, if there were any assurance to be has
thereof?

A. He which stablisheth us with you in CHRIST, and has anointed us, i^ GOD,
who has also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts,
(2. Cor. 1.21.) Wherein GOD willing more abundantly, to show unto the heirs
of Promise, the immutability of his Counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by
two immutable things, in which it was not possible that GOD should lie, we
might have strong consolat^on; who have fled for refuge, to lay hold on the
hope set before us; which hope we have, as anchor of the soul, both sure and
steadfast, and which enters into that, which is within the veil, whether the
forerunner is for us entered. Heb. 6.17.

Q. Show me then some marks whereby I may discern whether or no, my self am
one of that number which shall be saved?

A. 1. This is life Eternal, that we know him to be the only true God, and
JESUS CHRIST whom he has sent. Ioh. 17.3.

2. GOD so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believes in him, should not perish but have everlasting life, (Io^.
3.16.) These things I write unto you that believe in the name of the Son of
God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life. 1. Ioh. 5.13. Ioh. 5.24.3.36.
Acts 16.31.

3. It shall be, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be
saved, Act. 2 21.

4. We know that we are passed from death, to life, because we love the
brethren. 1. Io. 3.14

5. Whosoever shall humble himself, and become as a little child, the same is
great in the Kingdom of GOD. Mat. 18.4. Mat, 5.3.19.14.

6 The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
(Mat. 11.12.) and for joy thereof, depart, and sell all that they have to
purchase it, Mat. 13.44, 5.10.

7. There shall in no wise enter into it, any thing that defiles, nor
whosoever works abomination, or that makes a lie. (Reu. 21.27.) For without
are dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murderers, and Idolaters, (Reu.
22.15) Neither shall any that works abomination enter into the Kingdom of
GOD. Reu. 21.27.

The sinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulness shall surprise the Hypocrites:
Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire; who among us, shall dwell
with the everlasting burnings? He that walks righteously, and speaks
uprightly, he that despises the gain of the oppressions, that shakes his
hands from holding of bribes, and stops his ear from hearing of blood, and
shuts his eyes from seeing of evil: he shall dwell on high: (Isa. 33.14.)
And to him that orders his conversation aright, will I show the salvation of
GOD. Psalm. 5^.23.15.1.119.155. Math. 5.19. Ier. 17.13.

Ob. These things in some measure I do find to be in my self, yet my grief
is, that I can be no more sencible of this happiness?

A. 1. Now we see through a glass darkly; but then face, to face; Now we
know in part, But then shall we know, even as also we are known. 1. Cor.
13.12.

2. We are saved by hope, but hope that is seen, is not hope. For what a man
sees, why does he hope for it? But if we hope for that we see not, then do
we with patience wait for it, (Romans 8.24.) As well as JACOB, who said, I have
waited for thy salvation O LORD. Genesis 49.18. 1. Pet. 1.9.

3. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not
seen, (Heb. 11.1) Whom having not seen, you love: in whom though you see him
not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory
receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls. 1. Pet. 1.8.

4. For this end, pray, saying, Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and
uphold me with thy free spirit, (Psalm. 51.12.) And then with joy shall you draw
water out of the wels of salvation. Isa. 12.3.

Ob. I am beset with so many enemies, that my fear is, I shall fall short of
Heaven?

A. We are kept by the power of GOD through faith unto salvation ready to
bereuealed in the last times. (1. Pet. 1.5.) When Christ shall put down all
rule, and all authority, and power. For he must reign till he have put all his
enemies under his feet: the last whereof that shall be destroyed is death. For
he has put all things under his feet; but when he says, all things are put
under him, it is manifest, that he is excepted, which did put all things under
him. 1. Cor. 15.24.

Q. Seeing GOD ha^h provided for us such an inheritance, what therefore are we
to do?

A. 1. We are bound to give thanks always to GOD, because GOD has from the
beginning chosen us to salvation, through sanctification of the spirit, and the
belief of the truth. Whereunto he called us by the Gospel, to the obtaining
of the glory of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, 2. These, 2.13. 1. Pet. 1.3.4.

2 Because the Scriptures are called the Word of the Kingdom (Mat. 13.19.)
Search the Scr^ptures, for in them ye think to have eternal life: Ioh. 5.39.

In which, because some things are hard to be understood, (2. Pet. 3.16.) Let
every man be swift to hear, (Iam. 1.19.) For after that in the Wisdom of
GOD, the World by Wisdom knew not GOD, it pleased GOD by the foolishnes of
Preaching, to save them that believe, 1. Cor. 1.21.

3. Seeing we here have no continuing City, but we seek one to come, (Heb.
13.14.) And the time here being short, it remains that both they that have
Wives, be as though they had none, and they that weep, as though they wept
not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as
though they possessed not, and they that use this world, as not abusing it: for
the fashion of this World passes away: (1. Cor. 7.29.) And we according to
his Promise, look for new Heavens, and a new earth, where dwells
Righteousness. 2. Pet. 3.13. Ioh. 6.27.

4. Make you friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye fail,
they may receive you into everlasting habitations. Luke 16.9.

Sell that ye have and give Alms, and provide your selves Bags, which wax
not old, and treasures in Heaven that fail not. Luke 12.33. Matthew. 6.19.

5. Having therefore these promises, let us cleanse our selves, from all
filthiness, of flesh, and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of GOD, 2.
Cor. 7.1.

And let us fear left a promise, being left us, of entering into his rest, any
of you should seem to come short of it, (Heb. 4.1.) Wherein we ought to give
the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, least at any time we
should let them slip. For if the Word spoken by Angels was steadfast, and every
transgression, and disobedience, received a just recompense of reward; how
shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to
be spoken by the LORD, and was confirmed to us, by them that heard him. Heb.
2.1.

Wherefore the rather brethren, give diligence to make your calling, and
election sure: for if ye do these things ye shall never fall For so an
entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlast ng Kingdom, of
our Lord and Savior JESUS CHRIST, 2. Pet. 1.10, 11. R^u. 22.14. Heb. 12, 28.
1. Cor 15 34 R^m. 13.11. 1. Cor. 6.9. Tit. 2.11.

Q You tell me of Heaven, and if these be the cond^tions of attaining it, how
shall I ^e animated to come there?

A. If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
cross, and follow me. For whosoever shall save his life, shall loose it; and
whosever will loose his life for my sake, shall find it. For what is a man
profited, if he gain the whole world, and loose his own soul? And what
shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Math. 16.24.

Know ye not that they which run in a race, run all, yet one receives the
prize. So run that you may obtain. And every one that proves masterie*
abstaineth from all things; and they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown;
but we for an incorruptible 1. Cor. 9.24.

Therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of JESUS CHRIST. No man that
warreth intangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please
him who has chosen him to be a soldier. And if a man also strive for a
masterie, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. The husbandman that
labors, must first be partakers of the fruits. Consider what I say, and the
Lord give thee understanding in all things. 2. Tim. 2.3. Math. 10.37.

Q. When we have done what we can, will our well-doing merit Heaven?

A. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his
mercy he saves us, by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
Ghost which he shed on us abundantly, through JESUS CHRIST our Savior; that
being justified by his Grace, we should be made heirs, according to the hope
of Eternal life. Tit. 3.5. Ephesians. 2.8.

CHAP. XVIII. Of eternal Death.
Q. YOu have well satisfied me concerning the happiness of the Saints, after
the day of Judgment; show me also more fully, what shall then be the
punishment of the wicked?

A. They shall see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the Prophets in the
Kingdom of GOD, and themselves thrust out. Luke 13.28.

2. They shall be delivered to the tormentors, (Math. 18, 34.) who shall bind
them hand and foot, (Math. 22, 13.) and cast them into a furnace of fire (Mat.
13.42.) which is unquenchable, (Math. 3.12.) The place is deep and large; the
pile thereof is fire, and much wood; the breath of the Lord of hosts, like a
stream of brimstone, does kindle it, (Isa. 30, 33.) There they shall be
scorched with great heat; so as they shall blaspheame the name of God, which
has power over these plagues. There shall be great darkness, and they shall
gnaw their tongues for pain, (Revel. 16.9, 10.) For they shall drink of the
wine of the wrath of GOD, which is powered out without mixture, into the cup of
his indignation, and they shall be tormented with fire, and brimstone, in the
presence of the holy Angels, and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke
of their torment, ascends up for ever, and ever: and they shall have no rest,
day, nor right, (Reu. 14.10.) For their worm shall not dye, neither shall
their fire be quenched. (Isa. 66.24.) Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the
Cities about them, in like manner, giving themselves over to Fornication, and
going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, of suffering the
vengeance, of Eternal fire, Iud. v. 7. Job. 21, 30. Math. 13, 42. Psalm.
119.155.9, 17. Ier. 17, 13. Math. 8, 12.

Ob. This is but a mere scar-crow, and therefore we will go on and prosper.

A. O serpents, the generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of
Hell. (Math. 23.33.) For do you commit such things, and do you think to
escape the Judgment of GOD? (Romans 2.3.) Have ye not asked them that go by
the way? And do ye not know their tokens? That the wicked is reserved to the
day of Destruction: they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. Job 21.29.

Ob. It may be the base rabble cannot escape Hell; but my greatness will bear
me out well enough.

A. Riches profit not in the day of wrath, (Prou. 11.4.) For Dives though rich
went to Hell, when as Lazarus though poor was carried into Heaven* Luke 16.23.

Moreover, Tophet is ordained of old, for the King it is prepared, (Isa. 30
33.) Therefore Hell has enlarged it self, and has opened his mouth without
measure, and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that
rejoices among them, shall descend into it, (Isa. 5.14.) For God accepts not
the person of Princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor; for they are
all the work of his hands. Job, 34, 19. Luke 10.15.

Ob. These te^rours may concern Turks, and Papists, and Pagans; but for such
as live in the bosom of the Church they shall never, as I hope, be touched
with them.

A. Even in the Church also there are many called, but few chosen. (Math. 20,
16.) As in a great house, there are vessels not only of gold, and of silver,
but also of wood, and of earth; and some to honor, and some to d shonour, (2.
Tim. 2, 20.) And the children of the Kingdom, shall be cast out, into outer
darkness, (Math. 8.12.) For the Son of man shall send forth his Angels, and
they shall gather out of his kingdom, all things that offend, and them that
do iniquity. (Math. 13 41.) These are the tares which shall be bound in
bundles, to ^e burnt. Math. 13, 30.13, 47.3.7, 8.10, 1^.

Ob. Lord have we not eaten, and drunken in thy presence, and have thou not
taught in our streets? (Luke 13 26.) And have not most of thy mighty works
been done amongst us? Math. 11.20.

A. Woe unto thee Corazin, woe unto thee Bethsaida; for if the mighty works,
which were done in you, had been done in Tire and Sidon they would have
repented long ago in sack-cloathand ashes. But I say unto you, it shall be
more tolerable, for Tire and Sidon at the day of Judgment, then for you. And
thou Capernaum, which art exalted unto Heaven, shall be brought down to Hell:
for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in
Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, that it
shall be more tolerable, for the Land of Sodom, in the day of Judgment, than
for thee. Math. 11.21.

Ob. But Lord have we not Prophesied in thy Name, and in thy name cast out
Devils? Math. 7.22.

A. I profess unto you, I never knew you, depart from me ye workers of
iniquity. Math. 7.23.

Q. What then may the condemnation of Hell teach us?

A. Therefore dearly beloved, avenge not your selves, but give place unto
wrath: for it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay it, says the LORD,
Romans 12, 19, Math. 7, 1. Eccl. 3, 17.

2 Knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men, (2. Cor. 5, 11,) to
mortify their members which are upon the earth: fornication uncleanness,
inord^nate affection, evil concupisence, and covetousness, which is idolatry,
for which things sake, the wrath of God comes on the children of
disobed^ence. (3, Col. 5,) And enter ye in at the straight gate for wide is
the Gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction, and many there be
which go in thereat. But straight is the Gate, and narrow is the way, that
leads unto life, and few there be that find it: Mat. 7, 13, 7, 19, 5 29, 30,
31.

Q. What must I do, when upon good ground, I shall fi^d my self to be
delivered, from so great a condemnation?

A. Give thanks to God and say, Great is thy mercy toward me; for thou have
delivered my soul from the lowest hell. Psalm. 86.13.

Q Why? Is it not in man's power, to purchase Heaven, and to deliver himself
from Hell?

A. Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be borne again of Water, and
the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven. (Ioh. ^.3.) And
without holiness no man can see the Lord, (Heb. 12, 14.) And yet who can say
my heart is clean, I am pure from my sin, Prou. 20, 9. I^b. 9, 20. Isa. 64,
6. Job. 9.30, 31. Psalm. 93, 5.

CHAP. XIX. Of Sanctification.
Ob. IF this be our case, who then can be saved? Mark. 10, 26.

A. With men this is impossible, but with GOD all things are possible, (Math.
19, 26.) By whom there shall be a fountain opened, to the house of DAVID for
sin, and for uncleanness, Zach. 13.1.) And you shall be clean from all your
filthiness, and from all your Idols will he cleanse you. Ezekiel. 36.25.

And will turn to you a pure language, (Zeph. 3, 9.) that he who blesses
himself in the earth, shall bless himself in the GOD of Truth. (Isa. 65, 16)
And shall serve the Lord, their GOD, and DAVID their King, whom he will raise
up unto them. Ier. 30, 9. Hos. 2.16, 17. Zeph. 3, 13. Psalm. 37.30, 31. 2. Tit.
14. Ioh. 17, 19. Heb. 10.7, 10. 2. Cor. 13.8. Romans 8, 9. Zach. 8, 3. Ezekiel. 37,
28 1. These. 5, 23. Math. 13.33. Isa. 4.2.

Thus the heart of IEHOSAPHAT was lifted up in the ways of the Lord, (2. Chro.
17 6.) And ZACHARY, and ELIZABETH, were both righteous, and walked, in all the
ordinances of the Lord, blameless. Luke 1, 6. Act. 23, 1.24, 16. Heb. 13, 18.
Act. 10, 22.

Ob. Can the Blackmoores skin be changed, or a Leopard his spots? And can he
be good, that is accustomed unto evil? Ier. 13, 23.

A. Yea; for if the blood of Bulls, and of Goats, and Calves, and the ashes of
an heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctify to the purifying of the Flesh:
how much more shall the Blood of CHRIST, who through the Eternal spirit,
offering himself without spot unto GOD, purge your Consciences from dead
works, to serve the living God. Heb. 9, 13. Ephesians. 2, 1. Gal. 1, 23.

Ob. I feel the dwelling of sin in me still?

A. So did JOB, (Job, 9, 20.9, 30.31.) and DAVID, (Psalm. 38, 4.51, 3.) and
ISAIAH, (Isa. 64, 6.) and PAVL (Romans 7, 18. 1. Tim. 1, 15.) And so though you
also do walk in the flesh, yet do you ^ut war after the flesh. (2. Cor.
10, 3.) Sin shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the Law,
but under Grace, (Romans 6, 14.) For the law, of the Spirit, of Life, which is in
CHRIST JESUS shall free thee, from the law of Sin, and of Death. Romans 8, 2.
1. Cor. 12, 3.

Q. Why does CHRIST wash us who are so unclean?

A. CHRIST loves his Church, and gave himself for it, that he might
sanctify, and cleanse it, with the washing of water by the Word, and that he
might present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or
any such thing, but that it should be holy, and without blemish. Ephesians. 5, 25.
Hos. 14, 4.

Q. Is there nothing required of us for the furthering of this Grace in our
selves?

A. He that has this hope purifieth himself as he is pure, (1. Ioh. 3, 3.)
you shall therefore sanctify your selves, and ^ee shall be holy, for I am
holy: neither shall you defile your selves, with any manner of creeping thing,
(Leu. 11.44.) But if you walk in the Spirit, you shall not fulfill the lusts
of the Flesh, (Gal. 5, 16.) For every branch that bears fruit, he purges
it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Ioh. 15, 2. Romans 6, 12. Leu. 20,
8.20.26.

But his own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden
with the cords of his own sins, (Prou. 5, 22.) For God will give him up unto
his own hearts lusts, whereby he shall walk in his own counsels. Psalm. 81,
12.

2. He must pray saying; O Lord, why have thou made me to err from thy ways,
and hardened my heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants sake, (Isa. 63,
17.) Create in me a clean heart, O GOD, and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not the holy Spirit from me,
(Psalm. 51, 10.) Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins, let them
not have dominion over me. (Psalm. 19, 13.) Who can understand his errors?
Cleanse thou me from my secret faults, (Psalm. 19, 12.) I will run the ways
of thy Commandments, when thou have enlarged my heart. Psalm. 119 32, 41, 4.
Ioh. 17, 17.

Q. When we find this grace of Sanctification to be wrought in us, what must
we then do?

A. Because it is GOD which works in you both to will, and to do, of his
good pleasure, (Phil. 2, 13.) The^e^ore s^y ye, God be thanked, that we were
the servants of Sin, but we have obeyed from the heart, that form of
Doctrine, which was delivered us. Romans 6, 17.

Q. But shall no Sanctifying grace of GOD be wanting?

A. GOD gave not CHRIST the Spirit by measure: (Ioh. 3, 34.) For it pleases
the Father, thut in him should all fullness dwell, (Col. 1, 19.) And unto every
one of us is given Grace, according to the measure, of the gift, of CHRIST,
(Ephesians. 4, 7.) So that you shall come behind in no gift, (1. Cor. 1, 7.) But
of his fullness you shall receive, and grace, for grace, Ioh. 1, 16. Isa. 11,
2, 3. Psalm. 68, 19. Zach. 14, 8. Ephesians. 1, 3, 4.

CHAP. XX. Of Knowledge, Faith, Trust, and Hope.
Q. WHich is the first of those Graces?

A. To know the Truth, (Ioh. 8, 32.) I will (says God,) give them an heart to
know me, that I am the Lord, (Ier. 24.7.) For this is the Covenant that I will
make with the house of Israel, etc. I will put my Laws into their mind, and
write them in their hearts, etc. And they shall not teach every man his
neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know
me from the least, to the greatest, (Heb. 8 10. Ier. 31, 33.) And the Earth
shall be filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the LORD; as the waters
cover the Sea, (H^b. 2, 14) Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as the
light of the Sun; and the light of the Sun shall be seaven-fold, as the
light of the 7. days, (Isa. 30.26.) Whereby the people that sat in Darkness,
saw great light; and to them which sat in the Region of the shadow of death,
light is sprung up, Mat 4, 16.

And we know that the Son of GOD is come and has given us an understanding
that we may know him that is true, (1. Ioh. 5.20.) Which in other ages was not
made known unto the Sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy
Apostles, and Prophets by the spirit. Ephesians. 3, 5. Ioh. 1, 18, Pro. 2, 6: Job.
32, 8. Pro. 18, 15, 14, 6.

Thus the Romans were filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one
another, Romans 15, 14. 1, Cor. 1, 5. Psalm. 119, 98, 99, 100. ver. Ioh. 15, 15,
Ioh; 17, 25, 17, 6.

On the contrary, a Scorner seeks wisdom, and finds it not (Pro. 14, 6,)
he is ever learning, and never able to come to the Knowledge of the truth: (2.
Tim. 3, 7.) His way is as darkness, he knows not at what he stumbleth.
(Prou. 4, 19.) He shall dye without instruction, and in the greatness of his
folly, he shall go astray, Pro. 5.23. Prou. 18.2.14.18.3.32. Job, 17.4. Pro.
14.8. 15.14. Hos. 4.6.

Q. What may this teaeh us?

A. 1. Not to be as the Horse, and Mule, which have no understanding, (Psalm.
32.9. No nor yet to be as children; but in understanding to be men, (1. Cor.
14, 20.) Suffering the Word of CHRIST to dwell in you richly in all wisdom:
Col. 3.16.

2. Pray that GODS ways may be known upon earth, and his saving health among
all Nations, (Psalm. 67.2.) And for your selves that you may understand the
ways of ^his Commandments, (Psalm. 119.27.) and behold the wonderful things
of his Law? Psalm. 119.18. Psalm. 119.7, 33, 34, 73, 125 169.171. ver. 2. Tim. 2,
7.

Of Faith.
Q. Which is the second sanctifying Grace?

A. GOD will fulfill in you all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the
work of Faith with power, (2. These. 1, 11.) Whereby every one that has heard
and learned of the Father, comes unto CHRIST, Ioh. 6, 45.

For STEPHEN was a man full of Faith, (Acts. 6, 5.) And the Faith of the
Romans, was spoken of throughout the whole world, (Romans 1, 8. Acts, 24, 14,
27.25. Ioh. 10, 42.

Q. What may hence be learned?

A. Because all men have not Faith. (2. These. 3, 2.) Therefore build up your
selves in your most holy Faith, praying in the holy Ghost: (Iud. 20.) and
saying, Lord increase our Faith, (Luke 17, 5.) Lord we believe, help our
unbelief: Mark. 9, 24.

Of Trust.
Q. It being long betwixt the promise, and the accomplishment of it, how may
we in the mean while be vpheld?

A. Thou shall stay upon the holy one of Israel in truth* (Isa 10, 20.) Under
his Wings shall thou trust, (Psalm. 91.4.) For he is the confidence of all the
ends of the earth, and of them that are a far off upon the Sea. (Psalm. 65,
5.) Whereby they that know his name, will put their trust in him, Psalm. 9, 10.
Math. 12, 21. Isa. 51, 5, Psalm. 40, 4, 84, 12.

Thus David trusted in the Lord: (Psalm. 31, 6.) And the people rested
themselves upon the words of Hezekiah King of Judah, 2. Chro 32, 8. Psalm. 20,
7, 11, 1, 18, 2, 52, 8.144 1* 2, 56, 3, 4. Job. 13, 15.

Q. What would you hence infer?

A. Commit thy ways unto the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall bring it to
pass, (Psalm. 37, 5.) thy thoughts shall be established, (Pro. 16, 3.) And
happy shall thou be, (Pro. 16 20.) For it is better to trust in the Lord, than
to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord, than to put
confidence in Princes. (Psalm. 118, 8.) Surely men of low degree are vanity;
and men of high degree are a lie; to be laid in the balance, they are
altogether lighter than vanity. Psalm. 62, 9* 115, 9, 146, 3 4 34 22. Isa. 2,
22, 26, 4, 31, 1, 36, 6, Pro. 3, 5.

Of Hope.
Ob. GOD may not only delay his promise, but also by some evil occurrent
unsettle my confidence?

A. The wicked indeed is driven away in his wickedness, but the righteous has
hope in his death, (Pro. 14, 32) For Abraham against hope believed in hope;
(Romans 4, 18.) so Christ is in you the hope of glory, (Col. 1, 27.) Thou had
(says Iou^^) cast me into the deep, in the midst of the Sea, and the Floods
compassed me about, all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. Then I said,
I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple,
(Ion. 2, 3.4.) And now Lord what wait I for? my hope is in thee, Psalm. 39, 7*
46, 2, 33, 22, 119, 81 Psalm. 119, 166. Lam. 3, 24. Isa. 8, 17. Micha 7, 7. Tit.
2, 13, Acts 26, 6. Job, 5, 16.

Q. What use is to be made hereof?

A. Therefore look you also for the mercy of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, unto
eternal life: (Iud. 21.) And wait on thy GOD continually, (Hos. 12, 6.) For
happy is he, that has the GOD of JACOB for his help; whose hope is in the
LORD his GOD, which made Heaven, and Earth, Psalm. 146, 5, 33, 22, Lam. 3, 25,
26. Hos. 12, 6.

Ob. Then is every one happy, for who will not say, that his Hope is in GOD?

A. The hope of the Righteous shall be gladness; but the expectation of the
wicked shall perish, (Pro. 10, 28.) The eyes of the wicked shall fail, and
they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the Ghost,
Job. 11, 20, 8, 13. etc. Job. 27, 8, 9, 10.

CHAP. XXI. Of Love, Fear, Sorrow, Humility, and Repentance.
Q. WHat other Sanctifying Grace will GOD bestow upon us?

A. He will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed to love the LORD
thy GOD, with all thine heart, and with all thy Soul, that thou may live,
Deuteronomy. 30, 6. Pro. 8, 17. Cant. 1, 4, 3, 10. Psalm. 26, 8. Psalm. 116, 1. 1. King.
3, 3.

Thus MARY MAGDALEN she loved much, (Luke 7, 47.) I also love the LORD, (Psalm.
18, 1.) Yea LORD, thou know all things, thou know that I love thee: (Ioh.
21, 17.) And if any man love not the LORD JESUS CHRIST let him be Anathema
Maranatha, 1. Cor. 16, 22.

Q. What may this teach us?

A. To pray that the Lord would direct your hearts into the Love of GOD, (2,
These. 3 5.) And that your love may abound yet more, and more, in knowledge, and
in all Judgment: Phil. 1, 9.1, These. 3, 12.

2 Labor to keep your selves in the love of GOD, Iud. 21.

Of Fear.
Q. But that our love be not exorbitant, wherewith shall it be swaved?

A. He will give you one heart, and one way that you may fear him for ever,
for your good, and the good of your Children after you, (Ier. 32, 39.) And you
shall fear the LORD, and his goodness in the latter days, (Hos. 3, 5. Psalm.
34, 11. Deu^. 4, 10. Isa. 2^, 22, 23. Hos 3.5.

For thus the Midwiues feared God: (Exodus 1 17) And OBADIAH feared the LORD
from his youth, (1. King. 18, 3 12.) So did CORNELIUS with all his household,
Acts, 10, ^. Deuteronomy. 9, 19, Job. 1.1.

But the transgression of the wicked, says within my heart that there is no
fear of GOD before his eyes, (Psalm. 36, 1, 2,) For the fear of the Lord is to
hate evil, as pride, and arrogancy, and every evil way. Prou. 8, 13. Deuteronomy.
5, 29.

Q. What would you hence infer?

A. Therefore fear the Lord ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that
fear him, (Psa. 34 9.) Yea let all the Earth fear the Lord; let all the
inhabitants of the world stand in aw of him. Psa. 33, 8.85, 9. Ier. 10.7.

For, 1. There is Mercy with him, that he may be feared, Psa. 130, 4*

2 With GOD is terrible majesty, (Job. 37, 22.) He is a consuming fire, even
a jealous God, (Deuteronomy. 4, 24.) The Pillars of the earth tremble, and are
astonished at his reproof. (Job. 26, 11.) The foundations also of the Hills
moved, and were shaken, because he was wroth, Psalm. 18, 7, 97, 5, 104, 32.
Nahum 1, 3.1. Sam. 6, 20. Heb. 10, 31. Hab. 3, 16. Job. 9, 5.37, 1. Exodus
24.17. Deuteronomy. 5, 25, 26. Isa. 2, 10. Ier. 5, 2^, 22, 10, 10.

Of godly Sorrow.
Ob. If the fear of the Lord be to hate evil, then woeful is my condition,
who have again crucified CHR1ST by my sins?

A. Notwithstanding you shall look on him whom you have pierced, and you shall
mourn for him; as one mourns for his only Son, and be in bitterness for
him, as one that is in bitterness for his first borne: (Zach. 12, 10.) And you
shall remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and
you shall loath your selves in your own fight* for your iniquities, and for
your abominations: Ezekiel. 36, 31, 20, 43. Ezekiel. 6, 9. Ier. 31, 19, 51, 4. Zach.
13, 4, 1. Sam. 7.2.

Thus Gods people gathered themselves together at Mizpeh, and drew water, and
powered it out before the Lord, and fasted, and said, we have sinned against the
Lord. 1, Sam. 7, 6. 2, Sam. 2.24, 10, 17, Ier. 3, 25, Job. 40, 4, 5.

But as for the wicked, were they ashamed, when they had committed
abomination? Nay they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush, (Ier.
8, 12,) But were Brass, and Iron, Ier. 6.28, 29, 8, 5, 6, 2, ^5. Isa. 22, 12,
3, 9.

Of Humility.
Ob. The pride of my heart is also so great, as that I fear I shall not stoop
unto this?

A. There is indeed a generation, O how lofty are their eyes, and their eye
lids are lifted up? (Pro. 30, 13) as if they were rich, and stood in need of
nothing, (Reu. 3, 17.) We have heard also of the pride of Moab, (Isa. 16, 6,)
And of such which say, stand by thy self, come not near to me, for I am
holier than thou, Isa. 65, 5. Numb. 12, 1.

But as for me, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, neither do I
exercise my self in great matters, or in things too high for me. Surely I
have behaved and quieted my self, as a Child that is weaned of his Mother: My
soul is even as a weaned child, (Psalm. 131, 1.) And APOLLO was willing to
submit himself unto the teaching of AQVILA, and Priscilla, (Acts. 18, 26.) And
therefore whosoever is wise, and of knowledge amongst you, let him also show
out of a good conversation, his works, with meekness of wisdom, James, 3,
13 Psalm. 75, 4, 138, 6, 147, 6. 2. Cor. 10, 17, 18. Prou. 25, 27, 27, 2, 25.6,
7, 16, 5.6, 16, 18, 18, 12. Galath. 6, 3. Luke 14, 11. Romans 12, 16, 12, 3. Mat.
11, 29. Ezekiel. 21, 26. Ier. 9, 23. (48* 29.) 50, ^1, 32. Isa. 2, 12, 3, 16.
Acts. 12.21.

Of Repentance.
Ob. But what is confession of sin, without conversion from sin?

A. He will also heal thy backslidings, (Hos. 14, 4) For unto you, G^D has
raised up his Son JESUS and sent him to bless you, in turning away every one
of you, from your iniquities, (Acts, 3, 26.) And has also to the Gentiles
granted repentance unto life,: Acts, 11, 18) Who were as sheep going astray,
but are now returned unto the Shepherd, and Bishop of their souls, 1, Pet. 2,
25. Isa. 17, 7, 8.19, 18.19, 19, 21.23, 18. Zach. 13, 4, 5. Ier. 50, 5.

For Zachaeus stood, and said to the Lord, behold Lord the half of my goods I
give unto the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false
accusation, I rerestore him four fold. Luke 119, 8.

But the Reprobates they return, but not to the most high (Hos. 7, 16.) They
will not frame their doings to turn unto their God. (Hos. 5, 4) For their
bones are full of the sins of their youth, which shall lie down with them in
the dust. Job. 20.11.

CHAP. XXII. Of Zeal.
Q. WHat other Grace will GOD work in us?

A. Zeal, and that first of liking affections.

1. To CHRIST. For Paul and Barnabas hazarded their lives, (Acts 15.26,) being
ready not to be bound only, but also to dye at Jerusalem, for the name of the
LORD JESUS Act. 21, 13, Deuteronomy, 33, 9.

2 To his word, for says David, I have rejoiced in the ways of thy
testimonies, as much as in all riches, (Psalm. 1^9.14.) Mine eyes prevent the
night watches that I might meditate in thy Word, (119, 148,) My soul breaks
for the longing that it has to thy Judgments, at all times (119, 20,) Thy
Statutes have been my Songs, in the house of my Pilgrimage (119, 54,) O how
love I thy Law? It is my Meditation continually: 119, 97, 122.1.

Not to be daunted by any. But he will speak of GODS testimonies before
Kings, and will not be ashamed, (Psalm. 119, 46.) Who though they do speak
against him, yet will he meditate in Gods word: Psalm. 119, 23, 51, 69, 83, 143,
157, 161, ver.

But is increased by opposition. It is time says he, for the Lord to work,
for men have made void thy Law. Therefore love I thy Commandments above gold,
yea above five gold, (Psalm. 119, 126) And I will yet be more vile than thus,
and will be base in mine own sight, 2. Sam. 6.22. Acts 21, 13.

3 To his works I have not hid says David, thy righteousness within my
heart, I have declared thy truth, and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy
loving kindness, and thy truth from the great congregation, (Psalm. 40 9, 10.)
Seven times a day, I will praise thee, because of thy righteous judgments.
Psalm. 119, 164.119, 62.

4 To the worship of God. For David prepared with all his might, for the house
of his God. (1. Chron. 29.2. ver. 8, 9.) And the free gifts of the people for
the Tabernacle, were more than enough, and therefore were restrained from
bringing any more. Exodus 36.5. 2, Sam. 24, 24.1. Chro. 29, 21.29, 13, 14. 2,
Chro. 29.32, 33, 30, 24. 2, Chro. 35, 7. Neh. 4.17, 21, 23, 6, 11.7, 7^. Ezra.
2.68, Hag. 1, 14.

Though the wicked say the time is not come; the time that the Lords house
should he built. Hag. 1.2.

5 By rejoicing in the good they see in others. Having no greater joy than to
see Gods Children walking in the truth. (Ioh. 3. Epist. 4. And are alive, if
they stand fast in the Lord, 1. These. 3, 8. Phil. 2.7. 2. Chron. 29, 36.

6 By love toward Gods Ministers. For Paul does bear record unto the
Galathians, that they would have plucked out their own eyes, and given them to
him. (Gal. 4, 15.) Priscilla also, and Aquila, have for his life laid down
their own necks Romans 16, 3.4. 2. Tim. 1.16. 1. King. 18, 4.

7 Love to Gods people. I could wish says Paul, that my self were accursed
from CHRIST, for my Brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, (Romans 9, 3.)
And if (says Moses to GOD) thou will not forgive their sins, blot me I pray
thee, out of thy book, which thou have written: Exodus 32, 32. 2. Cor. 9, 1, 2,
8, 1, 2.

2 Zeal of disliking affections.

For Lot that righteous man dwelling among them of the old world, in seeing,
and hearing, vexed his righteous Soul, from day to day, with their unlawful
deeds, 2. Pet. 2.8.

And do not I hate them O Lord, that hate thee, and am I not grieved with them
that rise up against thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred, I count them mine
enemies (Psalm. 139, 21.) The zeal of thine house has eaten me up, and the
reproaches of them that reproached thee, are fallen upon me, Psalm. 69, 9.
Psalm. 119, 53. Psalm. 119, 136, 139, 158. verse. Act. 17, 16. Ier. 9 2. Exodus 32,
19. Nehem. 13.21. 25.1, 4. Isa. 30.22. Number. 25, 8. Romans 15, 3, 9. 2 Phil. 3,
18. Ezra, 9, 3. Dan. 10, 2. 1 Samuel 4, 18, 21, 22.

Q. What may we learn from all this?

A. Not to be sloathfull to do service, but to be fervent in Spirit, serving
the Lord, (Romans 12, 11.) And to be valiant for the Truth upon the Earth, (Ier.
9, 3.) Knowing that if you loose your first love, God will remove your
Candlestick out of his place, (Revel. 2, 4.) And if you shall be lukewarm,
he will spew you out of his mouth, Revel. 3, 16.

CHAP. XXIII. Of Charity, Justice, and Content.
Q. But with our love to GOD, shall we also have charitable hearts unto men?

A. You are taught of God to love one another, (1. These. 4, 9.) whereby the
Charity of every one of you all, one, toward another, abounds, 2. These. 1, 3.

Q. Wherein shall our Charity toward our Brethren be exercised, and expr^ssed?

A. 1 Toward their Souls. 1 As STEPHEN, who prayed for his persecuters,
crying with a loud voice; Lord lay not this sin to their charge, (Act.
7.60.) And as DAVID, who when his Enemies were sick, his clothing was
Sackcloth, he humbled himself with fasting, (Psalm. 35, 13.) And as ABRAHAM
for ABIMILECH, (Genesis 20, 17.) MOSES for PHARAOH, (Exodus 8, 12.) for Israel,
(Exodus 17, 11.) and for MIRIAM, Number. 12, 13. 1. Sam. 12, 18. 1. King. 13, 6.
Dan. 9, 20. Zach. 1, 12, 13. Acts, 12, 5.

2 As DAVID, (Psalm. 32, 8.) and SOLOMON, (Prove. 1, 2.) and JOB, who instructed
many, and strengthened the weak hands, (Job, 4 3) So to be a guide of the
blind, a light to them which are in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a
teacher of Babes, (Romans 2, 19.) In meekness instructing those also that oppose
themselves, if God per adventure will give them Repentance, 2. Tim. 2, 25.

2 Toward their Bodies; and therein first, Let them be as thine own bowels in
the Lord, (Phil. 20.) That so thy bowels may sound like a Harp, as for Moab,
and thy inward parts as for Kirharesh, (Isa. 16, 11.) Saying, look away from
me; I will weep bitterly, labor not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of
the Daughter of my people, (Isa. 22, 4.) For how can I endure to see the
destruction of my kindred? Esther, 8, 6. Job, 30, 25. Ier. 9, 1, 48, 31. Psalm.
35.13.14. 2 Samuel 1, 11, etc.

2 In keeping Hospitality; as did the old man of mount Ephraim, who coming
from his work, and lifting up his eyes, he saw a way faring man in the street
of the City, he brought him into his house, and gave provander to the Asses;
and they washed their feet, and they did eat, and drink, (Judge. 19, 16, 21,
ver.) And as the Brethren of Jerusalem, who gladly received PAVL, with other
Disciples of Samaria, and of his company, (Acts 21.16.) And as OBADIA^, who
took an hundred Prophets, and hid them by fifty in a Cave, and fed them with
Bread and water, 1 King. 18, 4. 2 Samuel 6.19. Acts 16.34.

3 In giving Alms; For TABITHA, was full of good Works, and Almsdeeds,
which she did. (Act. 9.36.) CORNELIUS also gave much Alms to the people, (Acts
10.2.) And the Disciples, every man according to his ability, sent relief
unto the Brethren, which dwelt in Judea, and sent it to the Elders, by the
hands of BARNABAS and SAVL, (Act. 11.29.) We do you also to ^it Brethren of
the grace of God bestowed ^n the Churches of Macedonia; how that (...) great
trial of affliction, etc. their deep poverty abounded, unto the riches of
their liberality. For to their power, I bare record; yea, and beyond their
power, they were willing of themselves. 2 Cor. 8.1. 2 Cor. 9.1. 2 Timothy 1.16.
Acts 20.34. Romans 16.1, 2. Act. 4.32. Psalm. 37.21. 2 Chro. 28.15.

Thus the righteous considers the cause of the Poor; but the wicked
regards not to know it, (Pro. 29.7.) For they will send the Widows away
empty, and the arms of the Fatherless will they break. Job 22.9. Job 24, 6.
Amos 2.7. 2 Samuel 23.7. Prou. 12.10. Judge. 5.23. 2 Chro. 19.2. Isa. 32, 6.

Q. What therefore must we do?

A. Seeing ye have purified your souls, in obeying the truth, through the
Spirit, unto an unfeigned love of the Brethren, see that ye love one another,
with a pure heart, fervently: (1 Pet. 1, 22.) And be ye followers of God as
dear children, and walk in Love, as CHRIST also has loved us, (Ephesians. 5, 1.)
That as you abound in every thing, in faith, in utterance, and knowledge, so
that ye abound in this Grace also. For ye know the Grace of our Lord JESUS
CHRIST that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye
through his poverty might be made rich, (2. Cor. 8, 7) Remembering also his
words, how that he says; It is a blessed thing to give, rather then to
receive, Act. 20, 35. 1. Tim. 6, 18. Pro. 17, 17, 14, 21, 14, 31. Luke 14, 12.
1. Pet. 4, 8. 1. Cor. 16, 1, 2.2, 8, 13. 1 These. 4.9, 10. Zach. 7, 9 Judge. 1,
7. 1 Samuel 15, 33, Leu. 19, 33, 25, 35. 1 Ioh. 4, 20. Nehem. 8, 10. Deuteronomy. 15, 7.
M^th. 5.42. Ioh. 15, 12.

Of Justice.
Ob. I have observed some men who have been very open handed in releeuing the
poor, who yet have made no Conscience to defraud the rich?

A. Surely Righteousness, and Mercy shall meet together, (Psalm. 85, 10.) For
I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness, (Isa.
60, 17.) Yea, thy people shall be all Righteous, (Isa. 60, 21.) And thou shall
be called the City of righteousness, the faithful City, Isa. 1, 26. Psalm.
72, 3. Isa. 26 9. Mal. 3, 3. Prou. 20, 7. Eccles. 7, 15.

As for me, my righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go, my heart
shall ^ot reproach me, so long as I live, (Job, 27.6.) For behold here I am;
witness against me before the Lord, and before his anointed, whose Ox have I
taken? Or whose Ass have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I
oppressed? Or of whose hands have I received a bribe, to blind mine eyes
therewith? And I will restore it you, (1. Sam. 12, 3.) Receive us, we have
wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man, (2. Cor.
7, 2.) The Lord is witness, and his anointed is witness this day, that you
have not found ought in our hands, (1. Sam. 12, 4) We have not taken one Ass
from you, neither have we hurt one of you, Numb. 16, 15. 1 Samuel 25, 14, 15, 1,
29, 6. 2 King. 12, 15, 2, 22, 5, 2, 145. 1 Samuel 29, 8. Job, 29.14. Isa. 51.1,
7. Genesis 6, 9. Deuteronomy. 33, 21. Prove. 8, 15.

Q. But is the practice of Justice a gift of GOD common unto all?

A. The wicked borrows, and pays not again, (Psalm. 37, 21.) They know not
to do right, says the Lord, who store up robbery, and violence in their
Palaces, (Amos, 3.10.) There is no equity in their goings, they have made
them crooked paths, (Isa. 59.8.) They will sell the Righteous for silver, and
the Poor for a pair of shoes; they pant after the dust of the Earth, on the
head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek, (Amos. 2.6.) Among
them Judgment is turned backward, and Justice stands far off; for Truth is
fallen in the street, and Equity cannot enter; yea truth fails, and he that
departs from evil makes himself a prey, Isa. 59.14. Micha, 2.1, 2. Hos.
12.7.

Q. What is the danger, which such wicked oppressors, do bring upon themselves?

A. He that does wrong shall receive for the wrong that he has done: (Col. 3,
25,) For I will come near to them in Judgment, and I will be a swift
witness against those that oppress the hirelings. (Mal. 3, 5.) For as much as
their treading is upon the poor, and they take from them burdens of Wheat;
they have built houses of hewn stone, but they shall not dwell in them; they
have planted pleasant vineyards, but they shall not drink the wine of them.
The prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time. Amos 5,
11, 3, 15, 5, 4, 7. Hab. 2, 6, 10, 11. Pro. 20, 10. Iam. 5.1. Mich. 6, 12.
Deuteronomy. 27, 17, 25. Mich. 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, Zac. 5, 1, etc.

Q. But I have observed none to prosper more than these men?

A. Better is the poor that walks in his uprightness, than he that is
perverse in his way, though he be rich, (Pro. 28, 6) A little that the
righteous man has, is better then the riches of many wicked, (Psalm. 37, 16.)
For an inheritance may be hastily gotten, at the beginning; but the end thereof
shall not be blessed: (Prou, 20, 21.) Bread of deceit may be sweet to a man;
but afterward his mouth shall be filled with gravel, (Prou. 20, 17) For as the
Partridge sits on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that gets riches,
and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end,
he shall be a fool. Ier. 17, 11. Eccl. 5, 13. Prou. 12, 27, 13, 11, 10, 2,
20, 17, 16, 8, 21, 7. Job. 20, 28.

Q. What may these things teach us?

A. Therefore withold not good from them, to wbom it is due, when it is in
the power of thy hand to do it: (Prou. 3, 27) Remove not the old Land-marke,
and enter not into the Feilds of the Fatherless, (Pro. 23, 10.) Do no
unrighteousness in judgment, in met-yard, in weight or in measure. Just
balances, just weights, a just Ephah, and a just hin, shall you have: (Leuit.
19, 35.) Trust not in oppression, become not vain in Robbery: (Psalm. 62, 10.)
And let no man go beyond, and defraud his brother in any matter; because the
Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also, have forewarned you, and
testified: 1. These. 4, 6.

Content.
Ob. Alas, I have coveted greedily all the day long: (Prou. 21, 6.) and
therefore am upon every occasion tempted to Injustice: (Eccles. 4, 7, 6, 1, 2.
Hab. 2, 5.

A. Why so? For I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel, (Act. 20,
33.) Yea, I have learned in whatsoever estate I am in, therewith to be content.
I know both how to be abased, I know how to abound; every where, and in all
things I am instructed, both to be full, and to be hungry, both to abound,
and to suffer need, I can do all things through CHRIST which strengthens me.
Phil. 4, 11. Job, 1, 21. 2. Sam. 19, 33, etc.

Q. What are these examples to me?

A. Therefore take heed, and beware of covetousness, for a man's life
consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses, (Luke 12,
15.) But yet every one that is greedy of gain takes away the life of the
honors thereof: (Prou. 1, 19,) Moreover, he that loves silver, shall not be
satisfied with silver, nor he that loves abundance with increase: (Eccl. 5,
10) Only Godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing
with us into this world, and it is certain that we shall carry nothing out.
And therefore having food and raiment, let us therewith be content, (1. Tim. 6,
6) Which that you may be.

1 Drink of the water which I shall give you, of which whosoever drinks,
shall never be more a thirst; but the water that J shall give him, shall be in
him a well of water, springing into everlasting life: Ioh. 4.13.

2 And withal pray, saying; Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to
covetousness. Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken thou
me in thy way: Psalm. 119.36. Eccles. 6.12, Hab. 2, 13, Prou. 23, 4.

CHAP. XXIIII. Of Sincerity, and Perseverance.
Q. THese were excellent Graces, if they were accompanied with Sincerity?

A. True, for GOD himself desires truth in the inward parts; and therefore in
the hidden part he shall make thee to know wisdom: (Psalm. 51, 6.) For he
shall put his law in thy mind, and write it in thine heart. (Ier. 31.33.)
Whereby thou shall stand with thy loins girt about with truth, (Ephesians. 6, 14.)
And be as the Kings Daughter, all glorious within. (Psalm. 45, 13) And as the
Elder to the elect Lady, whom he loved in the truth; for the truths sake,
which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever; (Ioh. 2, Epist. 1.2.) So
that in the uprightness of thine heart thou shall willingly offer unto the
Lord, an offering in Righteousness: 1. Chro. 29.17.

For thus Enoch walked with God (Genesis 5, 22.) Behold also Nathaniel, an
Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile. Ioh. 1, 47. Genesis 24, 40. Psalm. 116, 9.
2, King. 20, 3. Acts, 24, 16.

Of Hypocrisy.
Q. Is this any common Grace?

A. Help Lord, for the godly man cease: for the faithful fail from among
the children of men. They speak vanity every man with his neighbor; with
flattering lips, and with a deceitful heart do they speak, (Psalm. 12, 1, 28,
3.) Their mouth is full of deceit, and fraud, they sit in the lurking places of
the villages, (Psalm. 10, 7.) There is no faithfulness in their mouths, their
inward parts are very wickedness, their throat is an open sepulture, they
flatter with their tongues, Psalm. 5, 9. Prou. 20, 14. Dan. 11, 34. Ier. 5, 26.

As Judas who betrayed his master with a kiss, (Mat. 26, 49.) And as Ioab who
took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him, and slew him with
the other. 2, Sam. 20, 9. Genesis 49, 21. Ioh, 12 6.1, Sam. 18, 17.

So the house of Jacob (says God) do seek me daily, and delight to know my
ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the Ordinances of
their GOD; they ask of me the Ordinances of Justice, they take delight in
approaching to GOD: (Isa, 58, 2.) and yet they bend their tongue like their
bow, for lies, but they are not valiant for the truth upon the Earth: (Ier. 9,
3.) Neither have they cried unto me with their hearts, when they howled upon
their beds: ( Hos. 7, 14. And though they say the Lord lives, yet do they
swear falsely: (Ier. 5, 2.) They return unto me, not with their whole heart,
but fainedly, says the Lord: Ier. 3, 10, Isa. 59, 13. Hos. 8, 2. 2, Tim. 3, 5.

For when he slew them, they sought him: Nevertheless they flattered him with
their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue; for their heart was not right
with him, neither were they steadfast in his Covenant: Psalm. 78, 34. etc. Math.
23.5, 14, 25, verses. 2, King. 10, 31. 1, Sam. 26, 21, 1, 24, 17.

Ob. It should seem this grace of Sincerity is very rare, and yet who will not
say, my heart is upright? Stand apart, come not near me, I am holier than
thou. Isa. 65, 5.

A. Most men will proclaim every man his own goodness; but a faithful man
who can find? (Prou. 20, 6.) All the ways of a Man are clean in his own
eyes, but the LORD pondereth the spirits, (Pro. 16.2) He that is first in his
own cause, seems just; but his Neighbor comes and searches him out:
Prou. 18, 17, 25, 14.

And therefore, if any man seem to himself to be somewhat when he is
nothing, he deceives himself: Galath. 6, 3.2. King, 10, 15.

Q. What is the danger of Hypocrisy?

A. Shall not I visit for those things says the Lord? shall not my soul be
avenged on such a Nation as this, (Ier. 5, 29.) Yea cursed shall he be that
smites his neighbor secretly, and all the people shall say Amen. (Deuteronomy.
27.24.) So that the Hypocrites hope shall be cut off, and their trust shall be
a Spiders web. He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he
shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure, Job, 8, 13. Psalm. 12, 3.

Q. Wherein then lies the difference, betwixt the estate of the Hypocrites, and
the true Nathaniels, in whom is no guile?

A. He that walks uprightly, walks surely; but he that perverteth his way
shall be known, (Prove. 10, 9.28, 18.) The integrity of the upright shall
guide them; but the perverseness of the transgressors shall destroy them,
(Prou. 11, 3, 5, 6.) By the blessing of the upright the City is exalted; but
it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked, (Prou. 11, 11.) For lying lips,
are abomination to the Lord; but they that deal truly are his delight, (Prou.
12.22.) And therefore better is the poor that walks in his Integrity, than
he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool, Prou. 10, 29.14.2.19, 1.14,
5.13, 6. Psalm. 84, 11.

Ob. But such become great, and do wax rich, they wax fat, they shine: Ier.
5.28.

A. What is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he have gained, when God takes
away his soul? Will God hear his cry, when trouble comes upon him? Will he
delight himself in the Almighty? Will he always call upon God? Job,
27.8.8.13, 11, 20. Pro. 10.28.

Q. What may this teach us?

A. Because as in the water, face answers face, so the heart of man, to man;
(Prou. 27.19.) Therefore let every man prove his own work, and then shall he
have rejoicing in him self alone, and not in another: Gal. 6.4.

2 Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is Hypocrisy, (Luke 12.1.)
Let love be without dissimulation: (Romans 12, 9.) And be ye perfect with the
Lord your God: (Deuteronomy. 18.13.) Not to be almost, but altogether such as PAVL
was, (Acts 26.29.) That so you may be able to say; Search me O God, and know
my heart, and try me, and know my thoughts: see if there be any way of
wickedness ^^me: Psalm. 139.23.26. 1. Math. 6, 1.

3 Pray saying; Let my heart be sound ^ thy statutes, that I be not ashamed,
(Psalm. 119.80.) Draw me not away with the ^icked, and with the workers of
Iniquity, which speak peace to their Neighbors, but mischief is in their
hearts: (Psalm. 28.^.) O continue thy loving kindness to them that know thee,
and thy righteousness in the upright in heart. Psalm. 36.10.

4 Take ye heed, every one of his neigh^^ur, and trust ye not in any Brother;
for ^very Brother will utterly supplant, and ^very Neighbor will walk in
slanders: ^^d they will deceive every one his neigh^^^r, and will not speak
the truth: They have taught their tongues to speak ^yes, and weary themselves
to commit iniquity: (Ier. 9.4.) Put ye not confidence in a guide, keep the
doors of thy Mouth from her that lies in thy bosom: (Micha, 7.5.) But learn
of CHRIST, who did not commit himself unto the Jews; because he knew all
men: for he knew what was in Man: Ioh. 2, 24.

The simple man indeed believes every word, but the prudent man looks well
to his goings. Pro. 14, 15. Esa. 59, 14. Ier. 12.6.

Of Perseverance.
Q. Sincerity I do confess to be a singular Grace, gracing all the rest;
but what assurance can you give me of perseuering therein? Job, 27.10.

A. The path of the Just is a shining light, that shines more, and more unto
the perfect day, (Prou. 4, 18.) If therefore that which you have heard from the
beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the same, and in the
Father, (1. Ioh. 2.24.) who shall establish you an holy people unto himself,
as he has sworn unto you. (Deuteronomy. 28, 9.) And shall confirm you unto the
end, that you may be blameless, in the day of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, 1 Cor. 1,
8. Psalm. 84 7.

For the Converts continued steadfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and fellowship,
and in breaking Bread, and in Prayers, (Acts 2, 42) And the Church of Thiatira
Her last works were more than the first: (Revel. 2, 19.) MARY also chose that
good part, which was not taken from her: (Luke 10.42.) And as for me my foot
has held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined; neither have I gone
back from the Commandment of his lips: (Job, 23, 11. But have inclined mine
care to perform his Statutes always, even unto the end: (Psalm. 119, 112.) And
if you also (says CHRIST,) keep my Commandments, you shall abide in my Love,
even as I have kept my Fathers Commandments and abide in his Love: Ioh. 15,
10. Hos. 14, 9.

Ob. But I have seen some in my days, who have been lights, and leaders of
others in the way of Godliness, and yet themselves proved Apostates: 1 Timothy 1,
19. Psalm. 36, 3.78, 57. Ioh. 5, 35. Ier. 8, 5. Hos. 4, 16. Ier. 2, 32. Prove.
26, 11.

A. Verily, verily I say unto you, whosoever commits Sin, is the servant
of sin. And the servant abides not in the house for ever, but the Son
abides ever. (Ioh. 8.34) For every plant which my heavenly Father has not
planted shall be rooted up: (Math. 15, 13.) They went out from us, but they
were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued
with us: But they went out, that they might be made manifest, that they were
not all of us. 1. Ioh. 2.19.

True it is, some men's sins are open before hand, going before to Judgment,
and some men follow after: (1. Tim. 5.24.) And many of the first shall be last,
and the last first: (Math. 20.16.) Nevertheless, the foundation of GOD
stands sure, having this seal, the Lord knows who are his. 2. Tim. 2.19.

Ob. While they stood, I could not come near them, and now they are fallen,
what less can be expected, but that my turn will be next?

A. You are not of them that draw back unto perdition; but of them which
believe, to the saving of the soul: (Heb. 10.^^.) For (says God) I will make
an euer^^^ting covenant with thee, that I will not ^^rne away from thee, to do
thee good, (...) I will put my fear into thine heart, ^ut thou shall not
depart from me. Ier. ^.40

Now the Lord is faithful, who shall ^^ablish you, and keep you from evil
(2. These. 3, 3.) For he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide
with (...) for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive;
because (...) sees him not neither knows him: for he dwells in you, and
shall be (...) you: (Ioh. 14.16.) And you need ^ut that any man teach you; but
as the some anointing teaches you of all things, ^^d is truth, and is no lie,
and even as it ^ath taught you, you shall abide in him. 1 Ioh. 2.27.

Q. But what must I do, that this promise of perseverance may be made good
unto me?

A. Pray saying; O Lord GOD of ABRAHAM, ISAAC, and ISRAEL our father, keep
this for ever in the thoughts of my heart, and prepare my heart unto thee. (1.
Chro. 29.18.) Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not:
(Psalm. 17.5.) And make me to increase and abound more and more; and to
establish my heart unblameable in holiness before thee, even our Father, at
the coming of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, with all the Saints: 1. These. 3.12.

2 Let him that thinks he stands take heed least he fall: (1. Cor.
10.12.) Looking to your selves, that you loose not those things which you have
wrought, that you may receive a full reward: ( Ioh. 2. Epist. 8.) And hereof I
give you a charge in the sight of GOD, who quickens all things, and before
CHRIST JESUS, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good Confession, that you
keep the Commandments, without spot, and unrebukable, until the appearing
of our Lord JESUS CHRIST: (1. Tim. 6.13.) For our desire is, that every one of
you do show the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope unto the end.
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them, who through faith, and
patience inherit the promises: (Heb. 6, 11.) Lifting up the weak hands, which
hang down, and the feeble knees, and making straight paths for your feet, lest
that which is lame, be turned out of the way: but let it rather be healed:
(Heb. 12, 12.) And grow in grace, and in the knowledge if our Lord JESUS
CHRIST, (2. Pet. 3, 18.) That so he that is righteous may be righteous still,
and he that is holy, may be holy still: Revel. 22, 11. Heb. 10, 23. Phil. 3.12.
1, Cor. 9, 24.2, Chron. 34, 31.2. Cor. 6, 1. Acts, 13, 43. 2. Tim. 3, 14.

Q. Why? what is the danger of falling away?

A. When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits
iniquity, he shall even die for the some, he shall even die for his iniquity,
which he has done: Ezekiel. 18, 24, 26.

The Lord indeed is with you, while you be with him; and if ye seek him* he
will be found of you, but if you forsake him he will forsake you: (2, Chron.
15, 2.) And will lead you forth with evil doers (Psalm. 125, 5.) And feed you
as a lamb in a large place: Hos. 4, 16.

Know therefore, and see that it is an evil thing, and bitter to forsake the
LORD thy GOD: Ier. 2, 19, 2, 13. Heb. 10, 38. Psalm. 73, 27. Iud. 5.6, 2, King.
23, 27. Ezekiel. 33, 12, Ioh. 2. Epist. 9. Ier. 2, 17. Mat. 15, 13. 2, Pet. 2, 20.

CHAP. XXV. Of temptations in general, and in particular of the Flesh.
Ob. IF this be the danger of backsliding, what will become of me, who am
exposed to many temptations?

A. There has no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man; but GOD
is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted, above that you are able;
but will with the temptation also make a way to escape: (1, Cor. 10, 13.) For
in that CHRIST suffered, and was tempted, he is able to succor them that are
tempted: (Heb. 2, 18.) And will establish you, and keep you from evil: (2.
These. 3, 3.) As well as he did PAVL who fought a good fight, who finished his
course, and kept the faith, (2, Tim. 4, 7. Revel. 3, 10) And therefore pray you
also, that you enter not into temptation: Luke 22, 40.

Ob. But is not GOD said to lead men into Temptation? how say you then that he
will deliver us out of temptation?

A. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of GOD; for GOD cannot be
tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man; but every man is tempted when
he is drawn away of his own Concupiscence, and is entised: 1. Iam. 13.14.

Ob. If the case stand thus, what shall I do, who have so much flesh remaining
in me?

A. Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no Physician there? Why then is not
the health of the Daughter of my people recovered? Ier. 8.22.

Ob. Alas this corruption is grown to such a head, as is not now to be subdued?

A. Though your iniquities prevail against you yet he shall purge them away,
(Psa^. 65 3^ Moreover every valley shall be exalted* and every mountain and
h^ll shall be made low, and the crooked things shall be made straight and the
rough places plain: (Isa. 40 4.) For the weapons of our warfare are not
carnal, but mighty through GOD, to the pulling down of strong holds, casting
down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts it self against the
knowledge of GOD, and bringing into captivity every thought, to the obedience
of CHRIST: 2, Cor. 10, 4. Acts 9, 20.

Ob. But do not you as PAVL did of himse fe, say of your self, that what I
would do, that I do not, but what I hate that do I? Romans 7, 15, 23. Gal.
5.17.

A. If I do that I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. Now then
it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me: (Romans 7, 16.) And
though I walk in the flesh, yet do I not war after the flesh, (2, Cor.
10.3.) For the Lord is that spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord is, there
is liberty: (2, Cor. 3, 17) Therefore I thank GOD through JESUS CHRIST our
Lord, hat with the mind I serve the Law of GOD, though with the flesh the Law
of sin: Romans 7, 25.

Q. What is required of us to be done, for the furthering of this Grace in our
selves?

A. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers, and Pilgrims, abstain from
fleshly lusts which war against the Soul. 1, Pet. 2, 11.

2 Pray saying, keep back thy Servant from presumptuous sins; let them not
have dominion over me; then shall thou be upright, and innocent from the great
transgression: Psalm. 1^ 13.

Ob. Notwithstanding, do what I can this burden of sin presses me very
sore?

A. Come unto me all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest: (Mat. 11.28.) For I am not come to call the Righteous, but sinners to
repentance: Mat. 9.13.

Ob. Behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God, (Ier. 3, 22.) But
we have gone astray like lost sheep, (Psalm. 119, 176.) And the way of man is
not in himself; neither is it in man that walks to direct his steps, Ier.
10, 23.

A. I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel: (Mat. 15, 24.)
Therefore I am come to save that which was lost (Mat. 18, 11.) and to bring
again that which was driven away, (Ezekiel. 34.16.) For how think you? If a man
have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, does he not leave the
ninety, and nine, and goes into the Mountains, and seek that which was gone
astray etc. Even so it is not the will of the Father which is in Heaven, that
one of these little ones should perish: Mat. 18, 12, 10, 6. Luke 15, 8, etc.

Ob. The worst as yet remains; for though I see my way before me, yet can I
not walk therein?

A. The Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak, (Math. 26, 41.) Yet a
bruised reed will he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till
he send forth Judgment unto victory: (Mat. 12, 20.) And he said unto me, my
grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness: 2,
Corinth. 12, 9.

Ob. All this while my appetite after 2Grace is not alayed?

A. I will power waters upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry
ground, (Isa. 44, 3) For as the Scriptures have said out of his belly shall
flow Rivers of living water: which be spoke of the spirit, which they that
believe on him should receive. (Ioh. 7, 38, 39.) I am also the bread of life he
that comes unto me shall never hunger, and he that believes on me shall never
thirst: John, 6, 35, 4, 13. Luke, 1, 53.

Ob. It is not meet to take the Childrens bread, and to cast it unto Dogs:
Mat. 15, 26.

A. True, yet the Dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the Masters table:
(Mat. 15, 27.) And therefore, if any man thirst let him come unto CHRIST, and
drink: (Ioh. 7, 37.) And he that has no money come; yea buy, and eat; yea
come buy wine, and milk without money, and without price. Wherefore do you
spend money on that which is not bread? And your labor for that which
satisfies not? Hearken diligently unto me and eat that which is good, and let
your soul delight it self in fatness. Incline your ear come unto him;
hear, and your soul shall live, (Isa. 55, 1.) And the spirit, and the bride
say, come; and let him that is a thirst come* and whosoever will, let him take
of the Waters of life freely: Revel. 22, 17. Ioh. 4, 10.

Q. But in coming shall I not be rejected?

A. All that the Father gives me shall come to me, and him that comes to
me, I will in no wise cast off. Ioh. 6.37.

Ob. Sir give me then this water that I thirst not: (Ioh. 4.15.) For
notwithstanding all you have said; It is the very breaking of my heart, to
think that I can serve GOD no better?

A. The Sacrifices of GOD are a broken Spirit; a broken, and a contrite heart,
God will not despise: (Psalm. 51 17.) For thus says the high, and lofty One,
that inhabiteth Eternity, whose name is Holy. I dwell in the high, and holy
place, with him also that is of a contrite, and humble spirit, to reviue the
spirit of the humble, and to reviue the heart of the contrite ones: (Isa.
57.15.) To open the blind eyes, to bring the Prisoners from the prison, and
them that sit in darkness, out of the prison house: (Isa. 42.7.) That they
might be called the trees of Righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that
he might be glorified. (Isa. 6^.2, 3.) Therefore turn ye to the strong holds
ye prisoners of hope; for even to day do I declare, that I will render double
unto thee: Zach. 9, 12. Isa. 49.8.61. 1. Psalm. 34.18.147, 3.

Ob. These are sweet promises I confess; but yet I want comfort still.

A. The Lord God has given CHRIST the tongue of the Learned, that he should
know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: (Isa. 50, 4) Blessed
therefore are you that mourn, for you shall be comforted. Math. 5.4.

Ob. Yet for all this the distresses of my soul are such, as be intolerable
to bear, and how to be delivered I know not?

A. Who is among you that fears the Lord, that obeys the voice of his
servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in the
Name of the Lord, and stay upon his GOD: (Isa. 50.10.) and seek unto him that
makes the seven Stars, and Orion, and turns the shadow of Death, into the
morning, and makes the day dark with night; that calls for the waters of
the Sea, and powers them ^^t upon the face of the earth; the LORD ^his name.
Amos, 5, 8.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the Temptations of the Devil.
Ob. THough I should prevail against the motions of the Flesh this fear yet
remains, least by any means, as the Serpent beguiled EVE, through his
subtlety, so my mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in
CHRIST. 2. Cor. 11.3. Job, 1.7.

A. Resist the Devil, and he will fly from you: (Iam. 4.7.) Now is the
judgment of this world, now shall the Prince of this world be cast out. Ioh.
12, 31.

Ob. What hope have we to prevail against so potent an Enemy?

A. I have written unto you Young men, because ye have overcome the wicked o^
(1. Io^. 2.14.) For we know that he that is begotten of GOD keeps himself
and that wicked one touches him not: (^ Ioh. 5.18.) For the Church of Pergam^
dwelling even where Satan's throne wa^ yet held fast her profess^on. Revel.
2.13 Job, 2.3.

Ob. It is not possible for me in m^ own st^ength to prevail?

A. For this pu^pose appeared the Son^^ of GOD, that he might destroy the work^
of the Devil: (1. Io^. 3 8.) Who sh^^^ bruise Satan under your feet shortly
(Romans 16.20.) And though the Prince of this world come, yet has he naught i^
him: (Ioh. 14.30.) But in two combate^ was foiled, and in the third was put to
fl^ght by him: (Math. 4.1.) So as the gates of Hell prevailed not against him:
Math. 16.18. Numb. 21.9.

Q. Wherewith was CHRIST furnished against Satan?

A. Forasmuch as the Children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also
himself likewise, took part of the same, that through Death, he might
destroy him that ^^d the power of Death, that is the Devil: ^Heb. 2.14) And
the Saints overcame ^^m also, by the Blood of the Lamb. Rev. 12, 11.

Q. May not Satan overcome at the ^ast?

A. No: for CHRIST has spoiled Principalities, and Powers, and made a show of
them openly, triumphing over them in his Cross: (Col. 2.15) And when he
ascended up on h^gh, he led Captivity captive: (Ephesians. 4 8.) Wherefore he is
able to save them to the utmost, that come unto God by him, seeing he ever
lives, to make intercession for them: (Heb. 7.25.) For he gives unto them
Eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out
of his Fathers hands; because his Father which gave them him, is greater than
all. Ioh. 10.28. Psalm. 68, 18.

Ob. But the Dragon, and his Angels do still continue their fight against us?

A. I have put enmity betwixt thee, and the Woman, and between thy seed, and
her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel: (Genesis
3.15.) Therefore though they fight, yet they prevail not, neither shall their
place be found any more in Heaven. Revel. 12, 8. Luke 10.18. Prou. 29, 27.

Q. What shall then become of them, when they are so cast our?

A. The great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent, called the Devil and
Satan, which deceives the whole world, he was cast out into the earth, and
his Angels were cast out with him. Reu. 12, 9.

Ob. How is it then that when the sons of God come to present themselves
before the Lord, Satan is not shut out, (Job, 2, 1.) but is ready to stand at
his right hand to resist them? Zach. 3.1.

A. The Lord said; Simon, Simon, behold Satan has desired to have you, that
he may sift you as Wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not;
(Luke 22.31.) Saying, the Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord, that has
chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee. Zach. 3.2.

Q. Did the Lord JESUS make good his promise?

A. Yea; for though he were once foiled, yet he again recovered, for he went
^^t, and wept bitterly. Luke 22.62.

Q. Was he not by this foil of his, made for ever after the more faint-hearted?

A. No: for with greater courage, and boldness he both Preached, and professed
the name of Christ. Act. 2, 14, 3, 12, 4, 8, 4, 19.

Ob. Notwithstanding my fear is that at my appearing before Gods tribunal,
Satan will find some thing whereof to accuse me?

A. Why art thou so fearful, O thou of little faith. (Math. 8.26.) For I
heard a loud voice, saying in Heaven, now is come Salvation, and strength, and
the Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ; for the accuser of the
Brethren is cast down, which accuses them before our God, day and night.
(Reu. 12.10.) Moreover when Christ comes, he will convince the world of
judgment, because the Prince of this world is judged: (Ioh. 16, 8, 11.) There
is therefore, no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear: (1, Ioh 4,
18) And herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day
of Judgment; because as he is, so are we in the world: 1, Ioh. 4, 17.

Q. What shall then become of the Devil at the last?

A. The Devil that deceives Men, shall be cast into the lake of fire and
brimstone, where the Beast, and the false Prophet are, and shall be tormented,
day, and night for ever, and ever: Revel. 20.10.

Q. What use make you hereof?

A. Therefore rejoice ye Heavens, and ye that dwell in them: Revel. 12, 12.

2 Fight the good sight of Faith, (1, Tim. 6, 2.) And stand fast in the faith,
quit you like men, and be strong (1, Cor. 16, 13.) in the Lord and in the
power of his might (...) ^ut on the whole armor of GOD, that ye may be able
to stand against the wiles of the Devil: Ephesians. 6, 10.

3 Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring Lion,
walks about, seeking whom he may devour: 1. Pet. 5.8. 1, Cor. 16.13.

4 Pray, with all prayer, and supplication in the spirit, and watching
thereunto with all perseverance and supplication: Ephesians. 6, 18.

Ob. If the Devil be cast out, and is gone; what need is there of any more
watching against him?

A. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry
places, seeking rest* and finding none: he says I will return unto my house,
whence I came out. And when he comes, he finds it swept and garnished Then
goes he and takes 7. other spirits more wicked than himself: and they enter
in, and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first:
Luke 11.24.

CHAP. XXVII. Of the temptations of the World, and in particular of Afflictions.
Ob. NOtwithstanding all my watching and praying, if the Devil should cast out
of his mouth water as a flood, using the world, as an assistant, am I not in
danger to be carried away of the Flood?

A. No; for the earth shall help the Woman, and by opening of her mouth, shall
swallow up the Flood, which the Dragon shall cast out of his mouth: (Revel. 12,
16) Thus Gallio helped PAVL against the Jews: (Acts, 18, 14.) So did the
towne-Clarke also against the uproar of the people, (Acts 19, 35.) And the
Scribes on the Pharisees part, helped him against the Sadduces: Act^, 23, 9, 23,
22, 21, 31, 32. 2, Co^. 11* 32. Exodus 2, 6. Est. 9, 3.

Ob. But do we not see many a man how they are vanquished by the world, and
brought into subjection of the same?

A. Whosoever is borne of GOD overcommeth the world, and this is the victory
that overcommeth the world, even your faith: 1, Ioh. 5 4.

Ob. We for our part have no more power against the world, than we have
against Satan?

A. CHRIST gave himself for our sins, that he might redeem us from this
present evil world, according to the will of GOD, and our father, (Gal. 1, 4.)
And prayed, not that he should take us out of the world; but that he should
keep us from evil. Ioh. 17, 15.

Ob. If the child of GOD have overcome the world, whence is this vanity which
is done upon the earth: that there is just men unto whom it happens according
to the work of the wicked; again there be wicked men, to whom it happens
according to the work of the righteous? Eccl. 8, 14.

A. Can a bird fall in a snare where no fowler is? (Amos 3, 5) Affliction
comes not forth out of the Dust, neither does trouble spring out of the
Grave, (Job. 5, 6.) Is there any evil in the City which the Lord has not
done? (Amos, 3, 6.) From the Lord of Hosts which dwells in Mount Zion: (Isa.
8, 18.) Who forms the light, and creates darkness, who makes peace, and
creates evil; he, even he does all these things, Is^. 45, 7. Genesis 45, 8. ^am.
3, 38, Psalm. 17, 12.

Q. What may hence be learned?

A. Therefore le^ no man be moved by these afflictions; for you your selves
know that we are appointed thereunto. For we told you before that we should
suffer tribulation, even as it comes to pass, and you know it, (1. These. ^,
3.) For shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive
evil? Job, 2, 10, 4, 17.1, Sam. 26, 9. Ioh, 18.11.

Q Why? what is the disposition of GOD toward his Children in their
affl^ctions?

A. As a man chasteneth his Son, so does the Lord chasten them: (Deuteronomy. 8, 5.)
For whom he loves he chasteneth, and scourges every Son whom he receives. If
ye endure chastising, GOD deals with you as with Sons. For what Son is
the^e that the Father chasteneth not? If ye be without chastening, whereof all
are partakars, then are ye bastards and not Sons: Heb. 12, 6. Revel. 3, 9.

Q Show me wherein this fatherly disposition of his in affl cting his children
is exercised, and expressed?

A. 1 He does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men; Lam. 3, 33.

2 In all their afflictions, he is afflicted. (Isa 63, 9.) For when Israel put
away the strange Gods from among them, and served the Lord, his soul was
greeved for the miseries of Israel: (Judge. 10, 16.) And his bowels were
troubled for them: (Ier, 31, 20.) Saying, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
(Acts, 9, 4.) For we have not an high Priest, which cannot be touched with a
feeling of our infirmities e (Hebr. 4, 15.) But he that touches us, touches
the Apple of his own eye: Zach. 2, 8. Psalm. 103, 13 2, King. 13 4.13 23, 2,
14.26. Acts, 26, 14. 1. Pet. 5, 7. Mat. 6, 25, 34 2, Chron. 36, 15.

Ob. In all my affl^ctions I have had an eye unto GOD, but yet could never
discern any such affection in GOD toward me?

A. Then say unto GOD; O LORD, I have waited for thee in the way of thy
Judgments; the desire of my Soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of
thee. With my Soul have I desired thee in the night, and with my spirit within
me will I seek thee in the morning: (Isa. 26.8.) Look down from Heaven, and
behold from the habitation of thy holiness, and of thy glory; where is thy
zeal, and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels, and of thy Mercies toward
me? Are they restrained? Doubtless thou art our Father, though ABRAHAM be
ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou O LORD art our Father, our
Redeemer, thy Name is from Everlasting: Isa. 63, 15. etc. Psalm. 77, 7.

Q. But why does GOD lay Afflictions upon us, being his children?

A. What has the Lord, now done? Is there not cause? (1, Sam. 17, 29.) namely.

1 To prevent sin. For he opens the ear of man, and seals their
instruction, that he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from
man, (Job. 33, 16.) And lest he should be exalted above measure, there is given
him a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan, to buffet him: (2, Cor. 12,
7.) His way also is hedged up with thorns, and there is a wall made, that he
may not find his paths: (Hos. 2, 6.) Therefore fear not, because of
affliction, for GOD is come to prove you, that his fear might be before you,
that you sin not: Exodus 20, 20, 13, 17.

2 To remove sin. For if they be bound in fetters, and holden in the Cords
of Affliction, then he shows them their works, and their transgressions
that they have exceeded. He opens their ear also to discipline, and
commands that they return from iniquity: Ioh. 36, 8.

By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the
fruit, to take away his sin: (Isa. 27, 9.) and that he may be made partaker
of his holiness: (Heb. 12, 10.) For which cause we faint not, for though our
outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day: 2, Cor. 4, 16.
Hos. 5, 15. Isa. 26, 9 4.4. 2, Cor. 7, 8. Zach. 13 9. Ezekiel. 39, 22: Numb. 12
11. Ez^k. 20, 37. Mal. 3, 2.

Thus the Israelites in their trouble visited the Lord, and powered out a prayer
when his chastisements was upon them, (Isa. 26.16.) M^nassen after his
affliction, knew that the Lord he was God: 2, Chro. 33, 1^, 34, 27. Gen 42 21.
Psalm. 119, 67. Job 40, 4 23, 16. Iona. 3.3. Luke 15.17.

But for the wicked, why should they be smitten any more? they fall away more,
and more Isa. 1.5.22.12. Hos. 7.10. Amos, 4, 6.

3 To make us trust in God. For we had the sentence of Death in our selves,
that we should not trust in our selves, but in GOD which raised the Dead: (2.
Cor. 1.9.) And GOD suffered Israel to bunger, that he might make them know,
that man does not live by Bread only, but by every Word, that proceeds out
of the mouth of the Lord, does man live: (Deuteronomy. 8, 3.) The remnant also of
Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of JACOB, stay not upon him that
smote them; but shall stay upon the Lord, the holy one of Israel in truth. Isa.
10.20.

4 For our trial. God left HEZIKIAH to try him, that he might know all that
was in his heart: (2. Chron. 32, 31.) And he left the Cananites to remain, to
prove Israel, whether they would keep the ways of the Lord, and to walk
therein: (Judge..3.4.) JOSEPH also was sold for a Servant, and his feet were
hurt in the fetters, he was laid in the Iron, until the time that his word
came; the Word of the Lord tried him: (Psalm. 105, 17.) And a sword shall pierce
through thine own soul also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be
revealed: (Luke 2.35.) And thou shall remember all the way, which the Lord thy
GOD led thee these 40. years in the Wilderness, to prove thee, and to know
what was in thine heart, whether thou would keep his Commandments, or no:
Deuteronomy 8, 2. Genesis 22, 1. Gal. 6, 17. Reu. 2, 10. 1. Pet. 1, 7. Job, 23, 10.

5 To make us conformable unto CHRIST. That we may know him, and the
fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his Death: (Phil. 3,
10.) For we all are weak in him, (2. Cor. 13.4.) Filling up that which is
behind of the afflictions of CHRIST, in our flesh, for his bodies sake, which
is the Church: (Col. 1.24.) Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished
in your Brethren, that are in the World: 1. Pet. 5.9.

6 That we may escape the Judgments of the wicked. When we are judged, we
are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the World:
(1. Cor. 11, 32.) JOSEPH was sent before into Egypt, to preserve life: (Genesis
45, 5, 7) IOSIA was gathered to his Fathers, and to his Grave in peace, that
he might not see all the evil that was to ^^me: (2. Chro. 34.28.) Blessed
therefore (...) the Man whom GOD chasteneth, and ^eacheth him out of his Law,
that he may give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be
dug for the Wicked: Psalm. 94, 12. Exodus 23.28, etc.

7 To further us unto Salvation. For ought not CHRIST to suffer these things
and to enter into his Glory? (Luke 24.26.) And if we suffer, we shall also
reign with him: (2. Tim. 2, 12.) For our light Affliction, which is but for a
moment, works for us, a far more exceeding, and Eternal weight of Glory:
(2. Cor. 4, 17.) Though now for a season, if need be, we are in heaviness,
through manifold Temptations; that the trial of our Faith, being much more
precious then Gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be
found unto praise, and honour^ and glory, at the appearing of JESUS CHRIST. 1.
Pet. 1.6.

Confirm therefore the souls of the Disciples, and exhort them to continue in
the Faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom
of GOD: Acts, 14.22. Phil. 2 8. Luke 23.40.

8 That we may the better esteem of Prosperity. My wrath says GOD, shall not
be powered out upon Jerusalem by the hand of SHISHAKE. Nevertheless, they
shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the
Kingdoms of the Countries. 2. Chro. 12.7, 8.

9 That we may comfort others. For whether we be afflicted, it is for your
consolation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings, which
we also suffer; or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation, and
salvation: 2. Cor. 1.6. Heb. 4.15.

10 For examples sake to the wicked. Because (says GOD) they have profaned my
Name, among the Heathen, whether they went, I will sanctify my great name,
which was profaned among the Heathen, which they have profaned in the midst
^f them; and the Heathen shall know that I ^im the LORD, (says the Lord God)
when I shall be sanctified in them, before their eyes: (Ezekiel. 36.22.) For I
will set my Glory among the Heathen, and all the heathen shall see my Judgment
that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them, etc. And the
Heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into Captivity, for their
Iniquity because they trespassed against me; and therefore, hid I my face from
them, and gave them into the hand of their Enemies. Ezekiel. 39.21.23.

Q I know now that GODS Judgments are right, and that he in faithfulness
does afflict us: (Psalm. 119.75) But what moderation does he observe in the
same?

A. He will not lay upon man more than is right, that he should enter into
judgment with GOD: (Job, 34.23.) Neither has he dealt with us after our
sins, nor rewarded us according to our Iniquities: (Psalm. 103, 10.) But
exacteth of us less than our iniquities deserve: Job, 11, 6.

Ob. Though our Afflictions be not according to our Sins, yet may they
press us beyond our strength. Job, 6.12.

A. Through the Lords mercies we shall not be consumed, because his
compassions fail not: (Lam. 3 22.) We are troubled indeed on every side, but
not in distress; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not
forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; (2. Cor. 4, 8.) As unknown, and yet
well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, but not killed; as
sorrowing, and yet always rejoicing; as poor, and yet making many rich; as
having nothing, and yet possessing all things: (2. Cor. 6.9.) And though we
fall, we shall not utterly be cast down; for the LORD vpholdeth us with his
hand: (Psalm. 37, 24.) Neither will he execute the fierceness of his anger;
he will not return to destroy Ephraim; for he is GOD, and not Man, the holy
One of Israel in the midst of them: (Hos. 11, 9.) Whereby unto the upright
there arises light in darkness: (Psalm. 112.4.) And when I said, my foot
slippeth, his Mercy held me up. In the multitude of my thoughts within me,
his comforts delight my Soul: Psalm. 94, 18.

No man puts a piece of new cloth unto an old Garment; for that which is
put in, to fill it up, takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse;
neither do men put new Wine into old bottles; else the bottles break, and the
Wine runs out, and the bottles perish; but they put new wine into new
bottles, and so both are preserved: (Math. 9, 16.) And will GOD plead against
thee, with his power? No, he would put strength in thee: (Job, 23, 6.) and
strengthen thee, with strength in thy soul: Psalm. 138.3, 55.22, 34.20. Isa.
27, 8, 28, 27, 28, 29, 43, 2, 3. Exodus 3, 2. Numb. 11, 11. etc. Jonah, 1, 17.
Amos, 9, 8. Ier. 10, 24.

Ob. Notwithstanding this moderation, if God should be always wroth the
Spirit should fail before ^im, and the souls which he has made. Isa. 57.16.

A. The Lord will not cast off for ever; but though he cause grief, yet will
he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies: (Lam. 3.31.) And
though the Afflictions of the righteous be many, yet the Lord will deliver
them out of them all. (Psalm. 34.19.) The Lord vpholdeth all that fall, and
raises up all those that are bowed down. (Psalm. 145.14.) Whereby they shall
forget their misery and remember it as waters that pass away. (Job. 11.16.)
And it shall come to pass, that as he has watched over them, to pluck up,
and to break down, to destroy and to afflict, so will he watch over them, to
build, and to plant, says the Lord. (Ier. 31.28.) who delivers us from so
great a death, and does deliver us. In whom we trust, that he will yet deliver
us. 2, Cor. 1.10. Psalm. 41.1.34.6. 1, Kings 11.39. Isa. 28.28. Nehe. 9 28.

Ob. If we in respect of affliction should obtain but a bare, and naked
deliverance, the comfort thereof would not be great?

A. They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy. He that goes forth and
weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing,
and bring his sheaues with him: (Psalm. 126, 5.) For thus says the Lord, like
as I brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them
all the good I have promised, (Ier. 32, 42.) A little one shall become a
thousand, and a small one, a strong Nation, (Isa. 60, 22.) As one whom his
Mother comfort, so will I comfort you, and you shall be comforted in
Jerusalem. And when you see this, your heart shall rejoice* and your bones
shall flourish like an herb, and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward
his Servants, (Isa. 66, 13.) For he will make her wilderness like Eden, and
her Desert like the Garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found
therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody; (Isa. 51, 3.) The voice of the
bridegroom, and the voice of the Bride, the voice of them that shall say;
Praise the LORD of Hosts, for the LORD is good; for his mercy endures for
ever: Ier. 33, 11. I^a. 61, 11.61, 7, 60, 15, 57, 17, 18, verses 58, 8. Zach.
9, 13. Micha. 7, 8, 4, 6, 7. Ier. 30* 19. Esth. 8, 16. 2, Cor. 7, 5, 6. Psalm.
71, 19 21.

Ob. Our case seems to be too desperate, thus to be delivered?

A. O thou afflicted, and tossed with tempest, and not comforted; behold I will
lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations, with Saphires and I
will make thy Windows of Agates, and thy Gates of Carbuncles, and all thy
borders of pleasant stones: (Isa. 54.11.) And though you have lain among pots,
yet shall ye be as the wings of a Dove, eovered with silver, and her feathers
with yellow Gold: (Psalm. 68, 13.) For he raises up the poor out of the Dust,
and lifts up the beggar from the Dunghill, to set them among Princes, and to
make them inherit the throne of Glory; for the Pillars of the Earth are the
Lords, and he has set the world upon them: 1, Sam. 2.8. Psalm. 113.7.42.7, 8.
Ezekiel. 37.12.

Q. Does the Lord dispense this goodness of his, unto all men alike in their
afflictions?

A. The just man falls seven times a day and rises again; but the wicked
shall fall into mischief, (Prou. 24.16.) In the hand of the LORD there is a
Cup, the Wine is red, it is full of mixture, and he powers out of the same,
but the Dregs thereof all the wicked of the Earth shall wring out, and drink
them: (Psalm, 75.8.) Has he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? Or
is he slain, according to the slaughter of them, that are slain by him? In
measure when it shoots forth, he will debate with it, he stays his rough
wind, in the day of the East wind: (Isay, 27.7.) For how should I give thee up
Ephraim? How should I deliver thee Israel? How should I make thee as Admah? How
should I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within me, my repentings are
kindled together? Hos. 11, 8.

Therefore fear thou not O Jacob my Servant, says the LORD for I am with
thee; for I will make a full end of all the Nations whether I have driven thee:
but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure: Ier.
46.28, 19, 10. Numb. 24, 20 Psalm. 18, 27. Prou. 11, 28.

More^ver thus says the Lord God, behold my Servants shall eat, but ye shall
be hungry, behold my Servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold my
Servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed; behold my Servants shall sing
for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for
vexation of spirit. And you shall leave your name for a curse, unto my chosen,
for the LORD GOD shall slay thee, and call his Servants by another name: Isa.
65, 13. Ier. 10, 24, 25. Prou. 14.10.

Q. But will it not be long ere this deliverance comes?

A. I will bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my
salvation shall not tarry: (Isa. 46, 13.) A little while, and ye shall not
seem; and again a little while and ye shall see me; because I go to my
Father: (Ioh. 16, 16.) GOD is a very present help in trouble: (Psalm. 46, 1.)
His anger endures but a moment; in his favor is life; weeping may endure for
a night, but joy comes in the morning: (Psalm. 30, 5.) After two days will
he reviue us, in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his
sight: Hos. 6, 2.

Come therefore my people, enter thou into thy Chambers, and shut thy doors
about thee, hide thy self, as it were, for a little moment, until the
indignation be overpast: Isa. 26, 20.65, 1, 17, 14, 2, Sam. 24, 12, 13, 25.

Ob. But Zion said, the Lord has forsaken me, and my LORD has forgotten me
(Isa. 49* 14.) I am weary of my crying, my throat is dried; mine eyes fail
while I wait for my GOD: (Psalm. 69.3.) Behold I go forward, but he is not
there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him; on the left hand where he does
work* but I cannot behold him; he hides himself on the right hand, that I
cannot see him: Job. 23.8.9.19.13.3.3.13.26.33.19, 6.4.7.20 13.24.16.12.19.6.
Psalm. 88.3.40.12.102.3.1^6.3 Ruth 1, 20. Isa. 38.10. Ier. 20.15.15 10.

A. But he knows the way that thou take when he has tried thee, thou
shall come forth as Gold. (I^b. 23 10.) Although thou say thou shall not see
him, yet Judgment is before him therefore trust thou in him (Job. 35, 14.) For
the needy shall not always be forgotten, the expectation of the poor shall
not perish for ever: (Psalm. 9.18.) For can a woman forget her sucking Child,
that she should not have compassion, on the Son of her womb? Yea they may
forget, yet will not I forget thee, says the LORD: (Isa. 49.15.) The hope
indeed deferred makes the heart sick: but when the desire is accomplished, it
is a tree of Life: Prou. 13.12.

Ye have therefore need of patience, that after ye have done the will of GOD,
ye might inherit the Promise. For yet a little while, and he that shall come,
will come, and will not tarry: Heb. 10.36. Psalm. 56.8.

Q What man ever lived that could be patient, in suffering such things; with so
long waiting for deliverance as I have done?

A. He that believes shall not make have, (Isa. 28.16.) Therefore I wait for
the Lord, my Soul does wait, and in his word do I hope; my Soul waits for
the Lord more than they that watch for the morning, (Psalm. 130.5.)
Notwithstanding my confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face
has covered me. For the voice of him that reproacheth, and blaspheameth by
reason of the enemy, and avenger. All this is come upon us, yet have we not
forgotten GOD, neither have we dealt falsely in his Covenant. Our heart is not
turned back, neither have our steps declined from his way. Though he has
sorely broken us in the place of Dragons, and covered us with the shadow of
Death: (Psalm. 44.15.) Woe is me, says JEREMY, for my hurt; my wound is
grievous. But I said, truly this is a grief and I must bear it? (Ier. 10,
19.) I JOHN, am also your Brother, and Companion in tribulation, and in the
Kingdom, and patience of JESUS CHRIST. Rev. 1, 9.

Take therefore my Brethren the Prophets, who have spoken in the name of the
LORD, for an example of suffering Affliction, and of Patience: James, 5, 10. 2,
Timoth. 2, 5. Psalm. 119.83, 141, 143, 39, 9.123, 2, 38, 12, 13. Isa. 26, 8,
39, 8. 1, Sam. 26, 19, 2, 15, 25, 2, 16, 11. Job. 1.21. 1, Corinth. 4, 12.

Q. Why? what will a man's patience profit him?

A. Behold we count them happy which endure. You have heard of the patience of
JOB and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful, and
of tender mercy. (Iam 5.11.) And so ABRAHAM after he had patiently endured he
obtained the promise: (Heb. 6.15.) Blessed therefore are all they that wait
for him. (Isa. 30.18.) For the Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the
soul that seeks him. It is good that a man should both hope, and quietly
wait for the salvation of the Lord: Lam. 3.25.

In your patience possess ye your souls: (Luke 21.19.) And let Patience have
her perfect work, that ye may be perfect, and entire wanting nothing: (Iam.
1.4.) And take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek, and lowly
in heart, and you shall find rest unto your Souls: (Math. 11.29.) And it shall
be said in that day, lo this is our GOD, we have waited for him, and he will
save us; this is the Lord we have waited for him, we will be glad, and
rejoice in his Salvation: Isa. 25.9.

Therefore wait on the LORD, be of good cheer, and he shall strengthen
thine heart; wait I say on the Lord: (Psalm. 27, 14.) Saying, why art thou cast
down O my Soul, and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in GOD, for I
shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God: Psalm.
43, 5.42.11.62.1.2.

Q. By what means may this Grace of patience be attained?

A. 1 If any of you lack Wisdom, let him ask of GOD, that gives to all men
liberally, and vpbraideth not, and it shall be given him: Iam. 1.5.

2 This is my comfort in my Affliction, for his Word quickneth me: (Psalm.
119.50.) And if my delights had not been in his Word I had perished in mine
Affliction. Psalm. 119, 92.

3 I remembered his Judgments of old, and have comforted my self. (Psalm. 119,
52) I have considered the days of old, and the years of ancient times. I call
to remembrance my Song in the night: (Psalm. 77.5.) I remembered the years of
the right hand of the most high, I remembered the works of the LORD, surely I
remembered his wonders of old: (Psalm. 77, 10, 11.) And so strengthened my hand
in GOD: 1. Sam. 23.16. Psalm. 119, 52, 143, 5. 2 Cor. 1.10. 2 Timothy 4, 17, 18. 1 Samuel 17.37.

Q. When comfort, and deliverance comes, will it abide by us?

A. Whereas thou have been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through
thee, I will make thee an everlasting excellency, a joy of many Generations:
(Isa. 60.15.) For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies
will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment,
but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, says the Lord, thy
Redeemer: (Isa. 54.7. Lift up your eyes to the Heavens, and look upon the
Earth beneath, for the Heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the Earth
shall wax old like a Garment, and they that dwell therein shall dye in like
manner; but my Salvation shall be for ever, and my Righteousness shall not be
abolished: Isa. 51.6.

A woman when she is in travel has sorrow, because her hour is come; but as
soon as she is delivered of the Child, she remembers no more the anguish,
for joy that a Man is borne into the world. And ye now also have sorrow; but I
will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy shall no man
take from you: (Ioh 16.21.) For you shall be saved in the Lord with an
everlasting Salvation, ye shall not be ashamed, nor confounded, world without
end: Isa. 45, 17. Amos, 9.15.

Ob. This your discourse imports much comfort, notwithstanding all which, I do
remain but in the forlorn hope?

A. Are the Consolations of God small with thee? (Job, 15, 11.) Fools because
of their transgression, and because of their iniquities are afflicted. Their
soul abhors all manner of meat, and they draw near unto the gates of
Death: (Psa. 107.17, 18.) Wherefore then does a living man complain? A man for
the punishment of his sins: (Lam. 3.39.) And why cryest thou for thine
affliction? Thy sorrow is incurable, for the multitude of thine Iniquities, and
because thy sins are increased, I have done these things unto thee: (Ier. 30,
15.) Thine own wickedness corrects thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove
thee. Know therefore that it is an evil thing, and a bitter to have forsaken
the Lord thy GOD, and that his fear is not in thee, says the Lord God of
hosts: Ier. 2 19.

Ob. If our transgressions, and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in
them, how shall we then live? Ezekiel. 33.10.

A. O Israel, thou have destroyed thy self, but in me is thy help: (Hos.
13.9.) Therefore return thou backsliding Israel, says the Lord, and I will
not cause mine anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, says the Lord, and
I will not keep anger for ever. Only acknowledge thine iniquities, that thou
have transgressed against the Lord thy GOD, and ye have not obeyed my voice,
says the Lord. (Ier. 3.12.) If thou were pure, and upright, then surely he
would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase:
(Job, 8.6) It is meet therefore to say unto God, I have borne chastisement, I
will not offend any more: Job, 34.31, 32.

Wherefore if iniquity be in thy hands put it far away, and let not
wickedness dwell in thy Tabernacles; for then shall thou lift up thy face
without spot; yea, thou shall be steadfast, and shall not fear, because thou
shall forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away. And thine
age shall be cleerer than the noonday, thou shall shine forth, thou shall be
as the Morning: (Job, 11.14.) Turn thou therefore unto thy GOD, keep Mercy,
and judgment, and wait on thy GOD continually: (Hos. 12, 6.) And acquaint thy
self I pray thee with him, and be at peace; thereby good shall come unto thee:
Job, 22, 21.

For did not HEZIKIAH King of Judah fear the Lord; and the Lord repented him
of the evil he had purposed against him? (Ier. 26, 19.12* 16. Hos. 10, 12.6,
1. Ier. 26.3, 12.6, 18 8. Amos, 5, 4. Ezekiel. 18, 27. Job, 33, 23.

Ob. I have indeauoured my self in the work of Repentance what I can, and yet
my Affliction continues pressing me very sore?

A. Then cry unto the Lord, and he shall save you, out of your distresses:
(Psalm. 107.19.) Saying, Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak, O Lord
heal me, for my bones are vexed: (Psalm. 6.2.) Take away thy rod from me, and
let not thy fear terrify me: (Job. 9.34) Turn thou unto me, and have mercy
upon me, for I am desolate and Afflicted. The troubles of my heart are
enlarged, O bring thou me out of my distress. Look upon my Affliction, and
my pain, and forgive me all my sins: (Psalm. 25, 17.) O remember not my
former iniquities, let thy tender mercies speedily prevent me, for I am
brought very low. Help me O God, of my salvation, for the glory of thy name
deliver me. (Psa. 79.8.) I stretch forth my hand unto thee, my soul thirsts
after thee, as a thirsty land. Hear me speedily O Lord, for my spirit fails;
hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the
pit. (Psalm. 143 6.) O Lord correct me, but in judgment, not in thine anger,
lest thou bring me to nothing. (Ier. 10.24.) I am like a flower that is cut
down, which flies also as a shadow, and continues not; and do thou open
thine eyes upon such a one? And bring thou me to judgment with thee? (Job.
14.2.) Thine hands have made me, and fashioned me together, round about, yet
thou do destroy me. Remember I beseech thee, that thou have made me as the
clay, and will thou bring me into the dust again? (Job. 10.8.) Are not my
days few? Cease thou, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
before I go, whence I shall not return: Job. 10.20. Psalm. 79.5.77.7.85, 4, 25,
6, 7, 39, 12, 13.88.1.88, 14.102.1, 118, 25.119, 77, 143, 8.11. Job. 10, 1.13,
24.14, 6. Ier. 17, 14.17. Psalm. 42, 6, 119, 107. Isa. 64.8.

Q. When by these means I have found comfort and deliverance, what am I then
to do?

A. In that day thou shall say, O Lord, I will praise thee, though thou wast
angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortest me. Behold God
is my Salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my
strength, and my song, he also is become my Salvation, (Isa. 12.1.) My soul
wait thou only upon God, for my expectation is from him. He only is my rock
and my salvation; he is my defense, therefore I shall not be moved. In God is
my Salvation, and my glory, the rock of my strength, and my refuge is in God,
(Psalm. 62, 5.) For thou have taken away all thy wrath, thou have turned thy
self from the fierceness of thine anger, (Psalm. 78, 38.) Thou have delivered
my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling: (Psalm.
116.8.) My lips therefore shall greatly rejoice, when I sing unto thee, and my
Soul which ho u have redeemed, my tongue also, shall talk of thy
Righteousness, all the day long (Psalm. 71, 23.) I will say unto thee, thy
Righteousness O GOD is very high, who has done great things, O God who is
like unto thee? Thou who have showed me great and sore troubles, have quickened
me again, and have brought me up again from the depths of the earth: thou
have increased my greatness and comforted me on every side: (Psalm. 71.19.) To
the end that my glory may sing unto him and not be silent. O Lord my God, I
will give thee thanks for ever. Psalm. 30, 12, 49, 15.22, 22, 63, 7.66, 8.30,
3, 103.1, 4.85, 2, 3, 116, 7, 9. Isa. 61, 10, 49.13.38 20. Exodus 4, 31. Luke
17.15. Psalm. 35.18, 85.9, 116.5.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Persecution.
Ob. I Know now, that in the midst of Judgment, the LORD will remember
Mercy; notwithstanding the fear I have of falling into the hands of men, is
the very breaking of my heart.

A. I, Even I am he that comfort you; who art thou, that thou should be
afraid of a man that shall dye, and of a man, that shall be made as grass? And
forgettest the Lord thy maker, that spreads forth the Heavens, and lays the
foundations of the earth, and have feared continually every day; because of the
fury of the oppressor; as if he were ready to destroy? And where is the fury
of the oppressor? (Isa. 51, 12,) Behold I will make thy Face strong against
their Faces, and thy Forehead strong against their Foreheads: is an Adamant,
harder than flint have I made thy Forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed
at their looks, though they be a rebellious house: Ezekiel. 3.8.

Are not two Sparrowes sold for a farthing, and one of them shall not fall to
the ground without your Father; but the very hairs of your head are numbered.
Fear ye not therefore for you are of more value then many Sparrowes (Math.
10.29.) So that we may boldly say* the Lord is my helper, I will not fear what
man can do unto me (Heb. 13, 6.^ For the Lord God will help me, therefore
shall I not be confounded, therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I
know I shall not be ashamed. He is near that justifies me, who will contend
with me? Let us stand together, who is mine Adversary? Let him come near to
usee, Behold the LORD GOD will help me, who is he that shall condemn me? Lo
all they shall wax old as a Garment; the Moth shall eat them up. Isa. 50, 7.
Numb. 22, 18.38, verses, 24. 12, 13, 23, 8. Heb. 11, 27. Psalm. 140.12.

Ob. But do I not with these eyes see many of my Brethren, how cruelly they
have been handled by them? Psalm. 22, 12, 13, 143, 3, 4.

A. All that will live godly in CHRIST JESUS shall suffer persecution. (2. Tim.
3.12.) As formerly he that was borne after the flesh, persecuted him that was
borne after the Spirit, even so it is now, (Gal. 4.29.) that the Brother shall
betray the Brother to death, and the Father the Son, and the Children shall
rise up against their Parents, and shall cause them to die. And you shall be
hated of all men for my names sake: Math. 10.21.

These things have I spoken unto you, that you should not be offended; they
shall put you out of the Synagogue, yea the time comes that whosoever kills
you, will think that he does GOD Service. And these things will they do unto
you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. But these things have I
told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I have told you
them: Ioh. 16, 1.

Notwithstanding if the world hate you, you know it hated me, before it hated
you. If ye were of the World, the World would love his own; but because you
are not of the world; but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the
world hates you. Remember the words that I said unto you, the Servant is not
greater then his Lord; if they have persecuted me, they will persecute you
also: (John, 15, 18.) For if they do these things to a green Tree, what shall
be done to the dry? Luke, 23, 31. Math. 10.16.1, Corinth. 4, 9.10 13, 2. Cor.
6.9. Psalm. 22.12.

Notwithstanding they can have no power at all against you, except it be given
them from above: (Ioh. 19.11.8, 20.) For if Balaak would give unto Balaam his
house full of Silver, and Gold; he could not go beyond the word of the LORD,
to do less, or more: (Numb. 22, 18, 38, 24, 12, 13, 23, 8.) But unto you it
is given in the behalf of CHRIST, not only to believe, but also to suffer for
his sake: Phil. 1.29.

Ob, The very tongues of these wicked men do cut like a sharp rasor: (Psalm.
52, 2.) Adders poison is under their lips, (Psalm. 140.3.) Their teeth are as
swords, and their jaws are knives to eat up the afflcted out of the earth, and
the poor from among men, Prou. 30, 14. Job. 17, 6. Lam. 1, 7. Isa. 8, 18.
Psalm, 120.4, 22, 13.69, 11, 31, 12, 13 verses, 22.6.7.8. verses, 71.10, 83.3.
Ier. 18.18. Deuteronomy. 32.33.

A. Beloved remember ye the words which were spoken, before of the Apostles of
our LORD JESUS CHRIST, how that they told you there should be mockers in the
last times, (Iud. 17.18.) And call to remembrance the former days, in the
which after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight in afflictons;
partly while ye were made a gazing stock, both by reproaches and afflictions,
and partly while ye became Companions of them that were so used: (Heb, 10,
32.) But as the LORD turned the Curse of Baalam into a Blessing: (Deuteronomy 23, 5.)
So it may be he will look on your Affliction also, and requite good for
their cursing this day: (2. Sam. 16, 12.) And if ye be reproached for the
name of CHRIST, happy are ye; for the Spirit of Glory, and of GOD rests upon
you, which on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is
glorified: 1. Pet. 4, 14.

Therefore hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose
heart is my Law; fear ye not the reproaches of men, neither be afraid of
their revilings; for the Moth shall eat them like a Garment, and the Worm
shall eat them like Wool, but my Righteousness shall be for ever, and my
salvation shall be from Generation, to Generation. (Isa. 51.7.) And consider
him which endured such contradiction of sinners, least you be weary and faint
in your minds, (Heb. 12.3.) And go forth unto him without the Camp, bearing
his reproach, (Heb. 13.13.)

And say you unto such a one, why boastest ^hou in mischief, O mighty man? The
good^esse of God indureth continually. (Psa. 52.^.) And rherfore I will be more
vile than ^hus, and will be base in my own sight. ^. Sam. 6.22. Math. 10.24.

And turn unto God and say; have ^ercy upon us O Lord, have mercy upon ^s; for
we are exceedingly filled with con^empt, our soul is exceedingly filled with
^he scorns of those that are at ease, and ^ith the contempt of the proud.
(Psalm. 123.^.4.) Remove far from us reproach, and ^^ntempt, for we have kept
thy testimo^ies: Psalm. 119.22.

Ob. They do not only use threatening and reuiling words, but they lay to my
^harge things I never did: (Psalm. 35.^1.) They rejoice at me, as if I had been
^ound among thieves. Ier. 48.27. Act. 6.11.^3. 14. ver. 25.7.17.6. Math.
11.18.26.65. Ioh. 10.20.7.12. Ier. 15.10. Isa. 54.17.

A. Also now thy witness is in heaven, and thy record on high. (Job. 16.19.)
The Lord will not leave thee in the hand of the wicked nor condemn thee when
thou art judged: (Psalm. 37, 32.) For he shall stand at thy right hand, to save
thee from those that condemn thee: (Psalm. 109, 31.) And will put to silence
those lying lips, which speak grievous things, proudly, and contemptuously
against the Righteous, (Psalm. 31, 18.) wherein they think it strange that you
run not with them unto the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you; who
shall give an account unto him that is ready to judge, the quick, and the
dead: 1. Pet. 4, 4. Isa. 66* 5.

Blessed therefore are you when men shall revile you, and Persecute you, and
shall say all manner of evil against you, falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and
be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in Heaven; for so persecuted they
the Prophets which were before you: Math. 5, 11. Luke 6, 22.) But let none of
you suffer as a Murderer, or as a Thief, or as an evil doer, or as a busy
body in other men's matters; yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not
be ashamed, but let him glorify ^OD in this behalf: (1. Pet. 4, 15.) and
have your conversation honest a^^ng the Gentiles, that whereas they ^^ke
against you, as evil doers, they ^y by your good Works, which they shall
^^ld, glorify GOD in the day of Visi^ion. For so is the will of God, that by
^ll doing, ye may put to silence the ig^^rance of foolish men: (1. Pet. 2, 12,
15.) (...) being reviled, we bless; being per^uted, we suffer it; being
defamed, we ^reat; we are made as the filth of the ^^rld, and the of-scouring
of all things ^o this day. 1. Cor. 4, 12.

Thus doing may thou pray; Deli^^ my soul, O Lord, from lying lips, ^el
from a deceitful tongue: (Psalm. 120.^) And who is he then that will harm
(...), if you be followers of that which is and? (1. Pet. 3, 13.) Or if any
shall so ^^e, as the Sparrow by wandering, and the ^allow by flying escape, so
the Curse cause^^e, shall not come: Prou. 26, 2. Psalm. 19, 161.

Ob. But I shall one day fall into their hands: (1. Sam. 27, 1.) And be brough^
before Governors, and Kings for the Name of CHRIST: (Math. 10.18.) And what
alas shall I then do?

A. Do as TIMOTHY did, who professed a good profession before many witnesses:
(1. Tim. 6.12.) And as the Church of Pergamus did, who held fast his name and
denied not his Faith, even in those days wherein ANTIPAS his faithful Martyr,
who was slain where Satan dwelt: (Reu. 2.13.) And if they forbid you to
speak any more in that Name, then say unto them, whether it be right in the
sight of God, to hearken unto you, more than unto God, judge ye. For we
cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard: Act. 4 19.20,

Ob. Ah Lord God; behold I can not speak, for I am a Child. Ier. 1.6.

A. The hand of the Lord shall be upon thee, and shall open thy mouth, and thou
shall be no more dumb: (Ezekiel. 33, 22.) The tongue of the Stammerers shall be
ready to speak plainly: (Isa. 32.4.) For out ^f the mouths of Babes, and
sucklings has (...) ordained strength, because of his E^^mies, that he might
still the enemy, and ^avenger. Psalm. 8, 2.

Say not then I am a Child, for thou shall unto all that I shall send thee, and
what^^ever I command thee thou shall speak. Ierem. 1.7.) For who has made
man's Youth? Or who makes the dumb, and be deaf, have not I the Lord? Now
therefore I will be with thy mouth, and ^uch thee what thou shall say. Exodus 4,
11. When they therefore deliver you up, ^ike no thought, how, or what you shall
^eake, for it shall be given you in that ^ime hour, what you shall say: (Math.
10, 19. Luke 21.14) And I will give you a ^outh, and wisdom, which all your
adversaries shall not be able to gainsay, nor resist: (Luke 21.15. Act. 6,
10.) For the Scripture says, Whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed:
(Romans 10, 11.) For with the Heart man believes unto Righteousness, and with
the Mouth confession is made unto salvation. Romans 10, 10

You having therefore the same spirit^ of Faith, according as it is written,
believed, and therefore have I spoken; you also believe, and therefore speak:
(2. Cor 4, 13.) And be not afraid, and hold not thy peace; for I am with thee,
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: (Acts, 18.9.) But sanctify the Lord
God in your heart and be ready always to give an answer to every man that
asks you a reason of the hope that is in you, and that with meekenes, and
fear, 1. Pet. 3, 15. Math. 10, 32. Prou. 16.1. Acts, 4.9. Luke 12.12.

Ob. If for the hope of Israel I should thus stand in defense of the truth, I
shall for my labor be cast into some Dungeon: (Ier. 38.6.) be bound with a
chain, (Acts 28.20.) And my feet hurt with fetters of Iron. Psalm. 105.18.
Ezekiel. 19.9. John, 21, 28.

A, Though you suffer trouble as an evil doer, yet the word of God is not
bound (2. Tim. 2.9.) You may be a bondsman in deed, yet the Lord God will not
forsake you in your bondage, (Ezra. 9, 9.) No more than he forsook PAVL and
SILAS, who ^ing psalms in Prison, Acts, 16, 25.

For the Lord hears the poor, and des^seth not his Prisoners, (Psalm. 69.33.)
^et has broken the Gates of Brass, and ^^t the Bars of iron in sunder:
(Psalm. 107.^6.) And brings out those that are ^^und with chains, (Psalm. 68,
6.) For the iron gate opened unto Peter of its own ^ucord, whereby he escaped
the hands of Herod, Acts, 12, 10. Ier. 38.13.52.31. Psalm. 102.19.116 16.

Ob. It may be they will not always de^aine me a prisoner; but which is worse,
(...) may be banished into the Land of Strangers abroad: Reu. 19.10. Heb.
11.38. Act. 8, 1.

A. Although they shall cast you a far off among the Heathen, and although they
do scatter you among the Countries; yet will the to you as a little Sanctuary
in the Countries where you shall come: (Exek. 11.16.) And when you are in the
Land of your Enemies, I will not cast you away, neither will I abhor you to
destroy you utterly, and to break my Covenant with you; for I am the Lord your
GOD: (Leuit. 26.44.) But I will give you a reviuing there: (Ezra, 9 8.) And
make you to be pitied of all those that shall carry you Captive: (Psalm. 106,
46) And make the Enemy to entreat you well: (Ier. 15.11.) And I will be with
you as with JOSEPH in Egypt, who was a prosperous man, (Genesis 39, 2.) forgot all
his toil, and all his Fathers house, and became fruitful in the Land of his
Affliction: Genesis 41, 51, 52, 46 3, 47 27, 23, 11. Ier. 40.4, 37, 21. Deuteronomy. 4,
29. Revel. 1.9, 10. Psalm. 105, 12. Ier. 31, 10.

2 Moreover, hear the Word of the Lord, and declare it in the Isles a far
off, and say, he that scattered Israel, will gather him: (Ier. 31.10.) Fear
not, for I am with them, I will bring their seed from the East, and gather them
from the West. I will say to the North give up, and to the South keep not
back. Bring my Sons from far, and my Daughters from the ends of the earth
even every one that is called by my name, for I have created him for my glory:
(Isa. 43, 5.) For as the Shepherd seeks out his flock, in the day that he
is among his Sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my Sheep, and will
deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudie,
and dark day. And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from
the Countries, and I will bring them to their own Land: (Ezekiel. 34, 12.) So
that the redeemed of the Lord, shall return and come with singing unto Zion,
and everlasting joy shall be upon their head, they shall obtain gladness, and
joy, and sorrow, and mourning shall flee away: Isa. 51, 11.

Say ye therefore, turn again our captivity O Lord, as the streams in the
South: (Psalm. 126, 4.) O that Salvation were come out of Zion, when the Lord
brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel
shall be glad. Psalm. 14, 7, 53.6, 81, 5, 68, 22. Deuteronomy. 30, 1. Genesis 15.15.48,
21. Isa. 14, 12 26, 2, ^9, 10.30, 10, 27, 13, 49.25, 60, 15. Ier. 23, 3 24, 5.
Ezekiel. 36, 24. Amos, 9, 14. Zach. 10, 10. Exodus 12.41.

Ob. But in the mean while would it not grieve a man to part with his dear
friends, with what else he has? Ier. 5, 2. Lam. 5, 15, 3, 45, 46. Dan. 9, 15.

A. No mo^e than it would have grieved Leui, who said unto his Father, and to
his mother, I have not seen him, neither did he acknowledge his Brethren; nor
knew his own Children, (Deuteronomy. 33.9.) Or than others, who took joyfully the
spoiling of their goods, knowing in themselves, that they have in Heaven a
better, and an enduring substance (Heb. 10, 34.) For I say unto you, there is
no man that has left house, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or
Wife, or Children, or Lands for my sake, or the Gospel, but he shall receive
an hundred fold; now in this world Houses, and Brethren, and Sisters and
Mothers, and Children, and lands with Persecutions, and in the world to come,
life everlasting. Mark. 10, 29, Luke 14, 26, 14.33.17.32.

Ob. But more greevous things than these are imposed: for, for his sake are we
killed all the day long, and are counted as sheep for the slaughter: Psalm. 44,
22, 74.4. Lam. 3.42.

A. Yet I will not leave you comfortless, (Ioh. 14, 18.) But as my sufferings
abound in you so your consolation also abounds: (2, Cor. 1, 5.) For I will
pray the Father, and he shall g^ue you another comforter, that he may abide
with you for ever; even the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive;
because it sees him not, neither knows him. But ye know him for he dwells
with you, and shall be in you: (Ioh. 14.16.) Whereby our hope of you is
steadfast, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be
also of the Consolation. 2, Cor. 1, 7.

And therefore think it not strange concerning the fiery trial, which is to
try you, as if some strange thing happened unto you: (1 Pet. 4.12.) But rather
glory in tribulation, (Romans 5, 3.) As well as others, who were stoned, who were
sawne asunder, who were tempted, who were slain with the Sword, and otherwise
tortured, and yet not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better
resurrection: (Heb. 11, 35, 37.) So that we our selves gloried in the Churches
of GOD, for the faith, and patience of such, in all their persecutions, and
tribulations, which they endured: 2, These. 1, 4. M^th. 10, 28. Luke 17, 33.
Dan. 3.16.

Ob. If my torments should be as long, as violent, I shall shrink under them?

A. The rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the Righteous, least
the righteous put forth his hand unto wickedness, ^ Ps l, 125,3) For except
those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved, but for the
elects sake those days shall be shortened. (Math. 24 22.) For yet a very little
while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction:
Isa. 10, 25. 2, Tim. 3.9, 2, 4.17.

Q. When deliverance comes, shall the same last, and continue?

A. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I
arise says the Lord, I will set him in safety from him that puffs at him:
(Psalm. 12.5.) And then there shall be no more a pricking briar unto the house
of Israel, nor any grieving thorn, of all that are round about them, that
despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord: Ezekiel. 28, 24.

Therefore hear now this thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with the Wine,
thus says thy Lord, the LORD and thy GOD, that pleads the cause of his
people; behold I will take out of thine hand the Cup of trembling; even the Cup
of the Dregs of my f^ry, thou shall no more drink it again; but I will put it
into the hands of them that afflict thee, which have said to thy soul, bow
down, that we may go over, and thou have laid thy body as the ground, and as
the street to them that went over: Isa, 51, 21, etc.

Q. What may these comfortable promises, concerning the persecution of the
Saints teach?

A. To endure hardness, as a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST, (2 Timothy 2, 3.) And
be not ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, but be thou partaker of the
afflictions of the Gospel, according to the power of GOD: (2. Tim. 1, 8.) And
in nothing be terrified by your Adversaries, which is to them an evident token
of perdition; but to you of Salvation, and that of GOD: (Phil. 1 28.) Seeing it
is a righteous thing with God, to recompense Tribulation to them that trouble
you, and to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be
revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, 2: These. 1, 6.

Wherefore rejoice, in as much as you are made partakers of Christ's sufferings;
that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also, with exceeding joy:
(1. Pe^. 4.13.) For when you are tried, you shall receive the Crown of life,
which the Lord has promised to them that love him, (Iam. 1, 12,) For the which
cause, I also suffer these things. Nevertheless I am not shamed, for I know
whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I
have committed unto him, against that day. (2. Tim. 1.12.) Wherefore let them
also that suffer according to the will of GOD, commit the keeping of their
souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful creator. 1 Pet. 4.19. Reu.
20.6. 7.13. Luke 12, 6. 1 Samuel 23.16.1.30.6. Act 14 22.

2 Pray saying; O God, the proud are risen against us, and the assembly of
wicked men have sought after our soul and have not set thee before them. Psalm,
86, 14) Have a respect unto the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are
full of the habitation of cruelty: (Psalm, 74, 20.) Hear us, O Lord our GOD,
lighten our eyes, least we sleep the sleep of death: (Psalm. 13, 3.) Arise O
LORD, lift up thy self, because of the rage of our Enemies, awake for us to
the judgment thou have commanded ^ Psalm. 7, 6. Psalm. 17, 7, 17, 12, 7, 1, 119,
122, 140, 4, 25, 19. Lam. 3, 47, etc.

Attend unto our cry, for we are brought very low, deliver us from our
persecutors, for they are stronger than we: (Psalm. 142 6) Consider our enemies
for they are many. (Psalm 25.19) Give us help in trouble, for vain is the
help of man, Psalm. 108, 12, 8, 6 56, 1. Psalm 74 20. 2, Chron. 20, 6, 12. Act
^4, 26.

Our enemi^^ have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes
bowing down to the earth, Psalm. 17, 1^.) They have hid a snare for us and
cords; they have spread a net by the way side; they have set grinnes for us:
(Psalm. 140, 5.) Rid, and deliver us from the hands of strange children; whose
mouths speak vanity; and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood: (Psalm.
144, 11, 83, 5, 74, 20.) We have done Judgment and Justice, leave us not to
our oppressors: (Psalm. 119.121.) For they have dug a Pit for us, which is
not after thy Law: (Psalm. 119, 85) Let integrity and uprightness preserve
us, for we wait on thee: (Psalm. 25, 21.) O let the wickedness of the wicked
come to an end, but establish the just; (...) the righteous GOD, tries the
heart, ^^d the reins: (Psalm. 7.9) Shall the (...) one of iniquity have
fellowship with thee, ^uch frames mischief by a Law? Psalm. ^4 20.) Let none
that wait on thee ^^t ashamed, but let them be ashamed which transgress
without cause: Psalm. 5, 3, 119, 6.35, 23.43, 1, 7, 3. Lam. ^ 59.

Thy City, and thy people are called by ^y name: (Da^. 9, 19.) We are thine,
^ou never barest rule over them, they ^re not called by thy name: (Isa. 63,
19.) ^t now O Lord, thou art our Father, we ^t the clay, and thou art our
Potter, and we ^e all the work of thine hand. Be not ^ oath very sore O Lord,
neither remem^^r iniquities for ever: Behold see we ^eseech thee we are all
thy people: (Isa. ^4, 8.) Why does thine anger smoke against the Sheep of thy
pasture? Remem^er thy Congregation which thou have pur^hased of old, the rod of
thine inheritance, which thou have redeemed, this is mount Zion wherein thou
have dwelt. (Psalm. 74.1.) O deliver not the soul of thy turtle do v^ unto the
multitude of the wicked, forge^ not the congregation of the poor for ever*
Have respect unto the covenant (Psalm. 74 19.) Abba, father all things are
possible t^ to thee. Mark. 14.36. 2. These. 3.2. Ier. 14.9 21. Dan. 9.17. Psalm.
79.10.13. Deuteronomy. 9.26 Psalm. 86.16. Joel 2.17. Psalm. 74.20. Neh 1.10.

Thy holy Cities are a wilderness; Zion is a wilderness; Jerusalem a
desolation Our holy, and our beautiful house, where our Fathers praised thee,
is burned up wit^ fire and all our pleasant things are laid wast. Will thou
refrain thy self for these things O Lord? Will thou hold thy peace and
afflict us very sore? (Isa. 64 10.) know that for thy sake we have suffered
rebuke (Ier. 15.15.) Arise O God, plead thine own cause, remember how the
foolish men reproach thee daily. Forget not the voice of thine Enemies; the
tumult of those that rise up against thee increases continually. Psalm.
74.22.74.7.8.83.12. Ios. 7.8.

O Lord though our iniquities testify a^^inst us, do thou it for thy names
sake; (...) our backslidings are many, we have sin^ed against thee. (Ier.
14.7,) Yet do not ^^horre us for thy names sake, do not dis^race the throne
of thy glory. (Ier. 14.21.) ^et thy work appear unto thy servants, ^^d thy
glory unto their children. (Psalm 90.^6.) Let our mouths be filled with thy
^aise, and with thy honor all the day. Psalm. 71 8.) That men may know that
thou those name alone is Jehovah, art the most ^igh, over all the earth. Psalm.
83.18.106.^7.22.25.79.13.9.13.43.4.22.22.74. ^^, Deuteronomy. 9.26.

Bring our souls out of prison that we ^ay praise thy name; the righteous
shall ^mpasse us about, because thou have dealt ^^untifully with us. (Psalm.
142.7.) And (...) men shall fear, and declare the works ^f God; for they
shall wisely consider thy ^oings. The righteous shall be glad in ^he LORD, and
shall trust in thee; all the upright in heart shall glory. (Psalm. 64.^.) Let
not them that wait on thee O Lord GOD of hosts be ashamed for ou^ sakes; let
not those that seek thee be confounded, for our sakes O God of ISRAEL. Because
for thy sake we have born^ reproach; shame has covered our faces Psalm. 69.6.

Ah Lord God behold thou have made the heaven and the earth by thy great power,
an^ stretched out arm, and there is nothing t^ hard for thee. Thou show
loving kindness unto thousands, etc. the great, the mighty God, the Lord of
hosts is his name great in counsel, and mighty in work (Ier. 32.17.) And is
thy hand shortened, that it cannot help? or is thy ear heavy that thou can
not hear? (Isa. 59.1.) Thou O Lord remainest for ever, thy throne is from
generation to generation; Wherefore do thou forget us for ever, and
forsakest us so long time. (L^m. 5.19.) why should thou be as a man
astonished? As a mighty man that cannot save? (Ier. 14.9.) For thou art the God
of our strength, why do thou cast us off? Why go we mourning because of
the oppressions of the Enemy? Psalm. 43.2.

Our Fathers trusted in thee, they tru^ed, and thou did deliver them they
^yed unto thee, and were delivered; (...) trusted in thee, and were not
con^unded. But I am a worm, and no ^^n, a reproach of men, and despised ^f the
people, (Psalm. 22.4) Thou have also ^rought thy people out of the land of
EGYPT, with a mighty hand, and have got^^n thee renown, (Dan. 9.15.) Lord
where ^^e thy former loving kindnesses, which thou did swear unto DAVID in
truth? (Psalm. 89.49.) Thou did make me hope when I was upon my mothers
breasts; I was ^^st upon thee from the womb, thou art ^y GOD from my Mothers
belly: be not far from us, for trouble is near, and ^here is none to help.
(Ps. 22.9.71.5.) Cast us not off in the time of old age, forsake us not when
our strength fails. Psalm. 71.9, 22.20. Isa. 33, 2. Ier. 32, 21.14* 8. Isa.
51, 9. 2 Chronicles. 20, 6, 12. Psalm. 22, 21. Exodus 32, 11.

Remember Lord the reproaches of thy servants; how we do bear in our bosom
the reproaches of all the mighty people, wherewith thine Enemies have
reproached; O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine
anointed. (Psalm. 89.50.) Grant not O Lord, the desires of the wicked, further
not their wicked devices least they exalt themselves. (Psalm. 140.8.) And let
them not rejoice over us* let them not say in their heart, ah, so would we have
it; let them not say we have swallowed them up. Psalm. 35.24* 35.19
25.1.2.13.4.36, 11.86, 17. Lam. 5.1. Deuteronomy. 9 26. Psalm. 79.10. Exo. 32.12. Joel
2.17 Psalm. 68.3.

O satisfy us early with thy mercy, that we may rejoice and be glad, all our
days. Make us glad according to the days wherein thou have afflicted us, and
the years wherein we have seen evil. (Psalm. 90.14.15.) O that the salvation
of ISRAEL were come out of Zion! When the Lord brings back the captivity of
his people, JACOB shall rejoice, and ISRAEL shall be glad. Psalm.
14.7.43.3.83.3.86.17.40 10.

But thou have covered thy self with a Cloud, that our Prayers shall not pass
through: (Lam. 3 44.) Thou have vtter^y rejected us, thou art very wroth
against it, (Lam. 5, 22.) Awake; why sleep thou O LORD? Arise, cast us not
off for ever: wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our afflict^on,
and our op^ression? (Psa^. 44; 23.) Have thou utterly rejected Iuda^? Has thy
soul loathed Zion? Why have thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us?
We look for peace and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and
behold trouble: (Ier. 14, 19. O thou sword of the LORD, how long will it be
ere thou be quiet? Put up thy self into the scabberd; rest, and be still. How
can it be quiet, seeing the Lord has given it a charge against Zion? there
has he appointed it. Ier. 47, 6.

Now therefore our GOD; the great, the mighty, and the terrible GOD, who
keep Covenant, and mercy; let not all the trouble seem little before thee
that has come upon us. (Neh. 9.32.) But redeem Israel O God, out of all his
troubles: Psalm. 25, 22 40, 1, 40, 17. Ier. 15, 18. Psalm. 119, 84.119, 123.89
46.13, 1.80, 4 74, 9.22, 1.

Q. When God gives deliverance unto his Church, what shall become of their
cruel persecutors?

A. When the Lord has performed his whole work upon mount Zion, and on
Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the King of Assyria,
and the glory of his high looks: (Isa. 10.12.) They that hate thee shall be
clothed with shame, and their dwelling places shall come to naught, (Job,
8.22.) and perish; the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of Lambs: they
shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away: (Psalm. 37, 20.) They that
devour thee shall be devoured; they that spoil thee shall be spoiled; and
they that pray upon thee, I will give for a pray: (Ier. 30.16.) As they have
shed the blood of Saints, and Prophets, so they shall have blood to drink; for
they are worthy: (Revel. 16, 6.) For the Lord will plead the cause of his
Servants, and spoil the Soul of those that spoiled them: (Prou. 22, 23.) So
that the wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressors for
the upright: Prou. 21, 18. Isa. 33, 1.49, 26.51.23. Numb. 24, 8. Psalm. 53, 5,
7, 15.37, 13. Joel, 2, 20.3.1, 3.19. Amos. 1, 2. Zach. 2, 8. Obad. 10. Mich. 7,
10. Zach. 12, 6, 14, 12, 10, 5. Reu. 18.5, 12.13. Deuteronomy. 32, 41. Mal. 4, 3. Ier.
20.11, 49, 12, Psalm. 57, 6.

Thus Absalon persecuting David, was himself slain. (2, Sam. 18, 15.) And in
the place where Dogs licked the blood of Naboth, the Dogs licked the blood of
Ahab, and did eat Iezabel by the wall of Iezrael: 1, King. 21, 19, 23, 1, 22,
38, 1.13, 4, 2, 2, 24, 2, 9, 35. Acts, 12, 23, Dan, 6, 24, 3, 22. Genesis 12, 17,
19, 11. Exodus 7, 20, 8, 6.8, 17, 8, 24. 9, 6, 10, 9, 24, 25, 10.13,
10.22.12.29, 12.33. Esth. 7.10.9.10.9.25. Numb. 21.3. Therefore fret not thy
self because of evil dooers, neither be thou envi^us at the workers of
iniquity; for they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as
the green herb: Psalm. 37.1.

Ob. But do you not see, how the limbs of Antichrist do still prevail
against the Church?

A. The ten horns upon the beast, which are ten Kings, which have received no
kingdom as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with the beast. These
have one mind, and shall give their power, and strength unto the beast. These
shall make war with the lamb, and the lamb shall overcome them; for he is the
Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, etc. And then these ten horns shall hate the
whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and
burn her with fire. For God shall put in their hearts, to fulfill his will,
and to agree, and give their Kingdom unto the Beast, until the words of God
shall be fulfilled: Reu. 17.12. etc.

Q What use is to be made of these promises?

A. 1. Therefore O ye cruel persecutours, What mean you that ye beat my
people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor, says the LORD GOD of Hosts?
(Isa. 3, 15.) Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm (P^alm.
105, 15.) And refrain from these men, and let them alone; for your counsel,
and your works being of men, shall come to naught; but this being of God, you
can not overcome it, least happily ye be found even to fight against God,
(Acts, 5, 38) And let my sons go, that they may serve me; and if ye w^ll
refuse to let them go; behold I will slay your Sons, even your first borne:
Exodus 4, 23. Prou. 22, 22. 2, King. 19.21. Psalm. 2, 1.

2. Come out of Babylon my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and
that ye receive not of her plagues: Revel. 18, 4.

3 Pray, saying; Arise, O Lord, let notman prevail, let our enemies be judged
in thy sight; put them in fear, O Lord, that they may know themselves to be
but men, (Psalm. 9, 19.) Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy
name O Lord. Psalm. 83, 16.

Otherwise, let them be turned back, and brought to confusion, that devise our
hurt. Let them be as Chafe before the Wind, and let the Angel of the Lord
chase them. Let their way be dark and slippery; and let the Angel of the Lord
persecute them, (Psalm. 35, 4.) As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as
wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God:
(Psalm. 68, 2.) Bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with a double
destruction, (Ier. 17.18.) For they have eaten up Jacob, and devowred him* and
consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate, (Ier. 10, 25.) Therefore
render unto them a recompense, O Lord, according to the work of their hands.
Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. Persecute, and destroy them in
anger, from under the Heavens of the Lord, (Lam. 3, 64.) Do unto them, as to
the Midianites, as to Scisera, as to Iabin, at the Brook of Kison; which
perished at Endor; they became as dung for the earth. Make their Nobles like
Oreb, and like Zeeb; yea all their Princes, as Zeba, and Zalmunna; who said,
let us take to our selves the houses of God in possession. O our God, make them
like a wheel, as the stubble before the Wind. As the fire burns Wood, and as
the flames set the Mountains on fire; so persecute them with thy tempest, and
make them afraid with thy storm. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever;
yea let them be put to shame, and perish: Psalm. 83, 9. Psalm. 68, 1, 129,
5.40, 14. Psalm. 79, 10, 35, 1, 45, 3, 68, 1. Judges, 5, 31.

Q. What are we to do, when our Persecutors are thus destroyed, and we
thereby delivered?

A. Break forth into joy, and sing together; because, the Lord has comforted
his people; because he has redeemed Jerusalem, and made bare his holy arm, in
the eyes of all the Nations: (Isa, 52, 9.) And sing ye the Song of MOSES the
Servant of GOD, and the song of the Lamb, saying; great and maruailous are thy
works, Lord God Almighty; just, and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints.
Who shall not fear thee O Lord, and glorify thy Name? For thou only art
holy; for all Nat^ons shall come and worship before thee, for thy Judgments
are made manifest. Reu. 15, 3.

And as the Angels of the Waters, say unto God, thou art righteous, O Lord;
which art, and wast and shall be; because thou have judged thus; even so, Lord
God Almighty true and righteous are thy judgments* (R u 16, 5,) Wherefo^e we
give thee thanks O Lord God Almighty; because thou have taken to thee thy
great power, and have reigned: Reu 11.17.) And in the day that I called upon
thee, thou said, fear not. O Lord, thou have pleaded the cause of my Soul,
thou have redeemed my life: (Lam. 3, 57.) Yea, many a time have they afflicted
me from my youth; yet they have not prevailed against me. The Plowers plowed
upon my back, and made long their furrows. The Lord is righteous; he has cut
a sunder the Cords of the wicked. I. Psalm. 129, 2. etc. 97, 10, 66, 13.14. 2,
Cor. 1.3, 4. Psalm. 31, 23.18, 16, 9, 11. Isa. 26.13. Reu. 19, 1, etc.

CHAP. XXIX. Of Temptations by evil Examples.
Ob. WEll have you satisfied me concerning temptations on the left hand; but I
find more bitter than death, the woman whose heart is snares, and nets, and her
hands are bands. Eccl. 7.28. Prou. 23.27.

A. Notwithstanding, who so pleases God, shall escape from her: (Eccles. 7,
26.) For Joseph hearkened not to his lewd M^stresse, (Genesis 39.10.) Noah also
was a just man, and perfect in his generation: (Genesis 6 9.) And Lot being
righteous, and dwelling among the wicked, in seeing, and hearing: vexed his
righteous soul from day, to day, with their unlawful deeds: (2, Pet. 2.8,)
And we know that we are of God, when yet the whole World lies in wickedness*
1, Ioh. 5, 19. Dan. 11.32.

O^ the contrary, the mouth of the strange woman being a deep Pit, he that is
abhorred of the Lord, shall fall therein: (Prou. 22, 14) And the sinner shall
be taken by her: (Eccl. 7, 26.) As was Herod, by the dancing of Herodias: Math,
14.6. Numb. 31, 16. Dan. 11, 32.

Q. But what means must be used, that so I be not overtaken by such
inticements as these?

A. 1. Concerning the works of men, by the words of his mouth, thou shall be
kept from the path of the Destroyer: (Psalm. 17.4.) For when wisdom enters
into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy Soul, discretion shall
preserve thee, and understanding shall keep thee; to deliver thee from the
strange woman, even from the stranger that flattereth with her words, P^^^. 2,
10, 2, 16.

2. Because, as he that walks with a wise man, shall be wiser; so the
Companion of fools shall be destroyed: (Prou. 13.20.) Therefore from such
turn away: (2, Tim. 3, 5.) And say, O my Soul, come not thou in to their
secret; unto their assembly mine honor be not thou united: (Genesis 49.6.) But
depart from me, O ye will doers; for I will keep the Commande^ent of my God:
(Psalm. 119.115.) I will not ^^t with vain persons; neither will I go (...)
with dissemblers: Psalm. 26 4. Prou. 23, 10, 24, 1, 2, 22, 24, 25. 1 Cor. 5, 9.
Psalm. 120.5, 6.106, 35.143, 10. Numb. 25, 1. Deuteronomy. 4, 28. Prou. 1, 10.

3 Because we cannot altogether avoid their company, but by going out of the
world: (1. Cor. 5.10.) See therefore that ye walk circumspectly; not as
fools, ^^t as wise, (Ephesians. 5.15) working out our salvation with fear and
trembling; etc. that ye may be blameless, and ^^rmlesse, the sons of GOD
without ^ebuke, in the mids of a crooked, and ^eruerse Nation; among whom you
shine is lights in the world, holding forth the word of Life. Phil.
2.12.15.16. Leu. 18, 3, 4.

4 Pray, Incline not my heart unto a^y evil thing, to practice wicked works,
with men that work iniquity, and let me not eat of their dainties. Let the
Righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness, and let him reprove me, it shall
be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: Psalm. 141.4, 5.

CHAP. XXX. Of temptations by false Teachers.
Ob. IF neither the tyranny of Persecutors, nor the practices of profane
ones, shall vnsettie us from our steadfastness, then are we safe, and out of
danger?

A. But there were false Prophets also among the people, even as there shall
be false Teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable Heresies,
even denying the Lord that bought them: (2 Pet. 2, 1.) And many of them shall
come in my Name, saying; I am CHRIST, and shall deceive many. Math. 24, 5. Act.
15.1. 1. Ioh. 4, 1.

Ob. You teatme such Seducers, who ^ill not stick to say the same of you?

A. This I confess unto thee, that af^^r the way which they call Heresy, so
wor^^ip I the GOD of my Fathers; believing ^ll things, which are written in the
Law and the Prophets. Act. 24 14.

Ob. Many of these being learned in the Scriptures, and as they say, groun^ing
their opinions on the same, how should they swarne from it?

A. Some of these speak lies in Hypo^risie, having their Consciences seared,
with a hot Iron: 1 Timothy 4.2.

2 Others of them, God has shut up their eyes, that they cannot see, and their
^earts that they cannot understand. Isa. ^4.18.6.10. 1. Cor. 1.19. Romans 11.8.

3 The God of this world also has blinded the minds of some of them, which
be^eeue not, least the light of the glorious Gospel of CHRIST, who is the
Image of God should shine unto them. 2. Cor. 4.3.4. ^. Chro. 18.21.

4 Some things in the Scriptures themselves, are hard to be understood, which
they that are unlearned, and unstable, wrest unto their own destruction: 2
Pet. 3, 16.

Q. How comes it to pass that these broaching abroad Error, in stead of
Truth, should be so readily received?

A. Such are deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the Apostles of
CHRIST, and as the Ministers of righteousness. (2 Cor. 11.13.15.) Who through
Covetousness, do with fained words make merchandise of men: (2. Pet. 2.3.) And
come in sheep clothing; though inwardly they are ravening Wolves: Math. 7,
15. Jude, 12.

2 They speak of the World, and therefore the world hears them. Ioh. 1, 4, 5.

3 Many are laden with sins, and led away with diverse lusts; and therefore
are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, and so
are led captive by such. 2 Timothy 3, 6.

Q. Why then does God permit such dangerous Heretics to remain in the Church?

A. There must be heresies among you, that they which are approved, may be made
^anifest among you. 1 Cor. 11, 19.

Q. But are not we also in danger to ^e seduced by them?

A. We are of GOD; he that is of God beats us, although he that is not of
God ^eareth us not. Hereby we know the Spirit of Truth, and the spirit of
Error: (1 Ioh. ^, 6.) And you also little Children being if God, have overcome
them; because greater is he that is in you than he has is in the world: (1
Ioh. 4, 4.) Moreover CHRIST ^alleih his own sheep by name, and leads them
out. And when he puts forth his ^^ne sheep, he goes before them, and the
sheep follow him; for they know his voice, and a stranger will they not
follow, but will ^ee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers. Ioh.
10* 3.

And therefore such Heretics shall proceed no further, for their folly shall
be manifest unto all men. And you for your part, have fully known my Doctrine,
and manner of life, etc. Only evil men, and seducers shall wax worse, and
worse; deceiving, and being deceived. 2. Tim. 3.9.13.

Ob. Notwithstanding it staggereth me not a little, to see, and hear what
miracles some such have wrought.

A. I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will be none otherwise
minded. (Gal. 5.10.) For who should so bewitch you, that you should not obey
the truth, before whose eyes JESUS CHRIST has been evidently set forth, and
Crucified among you: (G^^. 3 1. K^owing this that Ant^christ his coming is
after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders and
with all deceiueablenesse, of vnr^ghteousnesse in them that perish. 2 Thessalonians. 2
9.

Q. How may I be preserved from these impostures?

A. Believe not every Spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of GOD, (1.
Ioh. 4, 1.) proving all things, and bolding fast that which is good: (1 Thessalonians.
5, 21.) As did the Church of Ephesus, who tried them, which said they were
Apostles and were not, and found them liars: Reu. ^, 2. 1 Cor. 14, 32. Prou.
14, 15. Isa. 8, ^0. Acts, 17.11.

Q. Show us then the marks whereby they may be known?

A. You shall know them by their fruits: ^ath. 7, 16.

1 By their Entrance; For he that ^ntreth not in by the door, into the
sheepefold; but climbeth up some other way, the same is a Thief, and a Robber;
but he that ^^treth in by the door, is the Shepherd of the sheep: Ioh. 10,
1, 2.

2 By their Doctrine; For hereby know ye the Spirit of GOD; every spirit that
confesses that JESUS CHRIST is ^ome in the Flesh, is of God. And every spirit
that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God, and
this is that Spirit of Antichrist, whereof you have heard* that it should come,
and even now is already in the World: 1 Ioh. 4, 2.1, 2, 22, 23.

3 By their opposing of faithful Ministers; For as IANNES, and IAMBRES
withstood MOSES, so do these also resist, the truth; men of corrupt minds,
reprobate concerning the Faith. 2 Timothy 3.8.

4 By their evil lives; ungodly men they are, turning the grace of God into
wantonness, and do defile the flesh. Jude, 4, 8.

5 If thou say in thine heart, how shall we know the Word which the LORD has
not spoken? When a Prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if the thing
follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord has not
spoken, but the Prophet has spoken it presumptuously. Deuteronomy. 18.21.

Ob. Some of these men have foretold us of things, which have come to pass?

A. If there arise among you a Prophet, or dreamer of dreams, and gives thee
a sign, or wonder; and the sign, or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke
unto thee, saying, let us go after other Gods, which thou have not known, and
let us serve the^, thou shall not harken unto the words of that Prophet, or
that dreamer, of dreams: for the Lord your God prooveth you, to know whether
you love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul: Deuteronomy.
13.1.

Therefore to the Law, and to the testimony, if they speak not according to
this word, it is because there is no light in them: Isa. 8, 20.

Q. What is the danger that such Heretics do expose themselves unto?

A. As they have sown the wind, so they shall reap the whirlewind: (Hos. 8,
7) For they being before ordained to condemnation: (Iud. 4.) Their judgment
now a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not, 2, Pet. 2,
3, Gal. 5, 10. Revel. 22, 18. Mat. 23, ^5. Ier. 28, 16.17. ver. 29, 31, 32.

Q. These Heretics being a people so dangerous, what may thence be learned?

A. Ye therefore beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware least you
also; being led away with the errors of the wicked, fall from your own
stedfaslnes, (2, Pet. 3, 17.) And be taken in a snare after them: (Deu^. 12,
30.) By being carried about with diverse, and strange Doctrines: for it is a
good thing, that the heart be established with grace; but not with meats, which
have not profited them that have been exercised in them: (Heb. 13, 9.) But
has occasion^d them to err concerning the faith: 1. Tim. 6, 20. 1, Cor. 3,
11. 1, Ioh. 5, 21. Prou. 19, 27, 30, 6. 2, Tim. 2, 1, 2, 2.1, 13, 14. Col. 2,
6. Math. 24, 26.

Q What do you account Heresy? Is every little swaruing from the truth
damnable?

A. If any man builds upon (Christ) the foundation: gold silver, precious
stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest. For the
day shall declare it; because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall
try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide, which he has
built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall he burnt,
he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be save; yet so, as by fire: 1,
Cor. 3.12. Gal. 5.9.

Q. You have then said enough for my settling; but because the time will come,
when other men will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall
heap to themselves Teachers, having itching ears, and shall turn away their
ears from the truth, and shall be turned to Fables: When these things come to
pass, what am I to do? 2. Tim. 4, 3.

A. Say unto such a one, I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that
called you into the grace of Christ, unto another Gospel* which is not
another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel of
Christ. But though we, or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Gospel unto
you, than that which we have preached, let him be accursed: (...) 1, 6.

Q. What if such a one shall yet not only persist in his error himself, but
shall seek to pervert others also?

A. Then set thine eyes upon him, and say, O full of all subtilty, and all
mischief, thou child of the Devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, will thou
not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? Now therefore the hand of the
Lord shall be upon thee: Act. 13.9

Q. What if he shall yet continue to despise my admonitions, and these
fearful menaces of Judgment?

A. A man that is an Heretic, after the first, and second admonition reject,
knowing that het^^^ is such, is subverted, and sins being condemned of
himself: (Tit. 3* 10.) And if such a one come unto you, receive him not to
house, neither bid him God speed, (Job. 2. Epist, 10.) But he shall be slain,
because he has spoken, to turn you away from the Lord your GOD, to thrust
thee out of the way, wherein the LORD thy GOD commanded thee to walk; so shall
thou take the evil away forth of the midst of thee: Deutrinom. 13, 5, 27,
18, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20.7. 2. Hos. 8, 7. Josh. 23, 12.

Ob. Though I have not proceeded against such Heretics, after this manner;
yet have I kept my self found in the faith?

A. Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou suffer,
that woman Iezabel, which calls her self a Prophetess, to teach, and to
seduce my Servants, to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto
Idols: Reu. 2, 20.

Ob. Shall I in this my neglect of duty, be as sorely punished, as they in
these their damnable Heresies?

A. N^, for behold I will cast her into a Bed and them that commit Adultery
with her, into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds, etc. But
unto you I say, and unto the rest of them of Thiatira; as many as have not this
doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan; as they speak, I
will put upon you none other burden: Reu. 2, 22.

CHAP. XXXI. Of Temptations by Prosperity.
Q. I Do now see there is much danger to be feared from earthly men, but is
the like danger to be expected from earthly things?

A. Yea; for Vzziah, when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his
destruction: (2. Chron. 26.16.) And the Israelites assembled themselves, for
Corn, and Wine, and they rebelled against the Lord: (Hos. 7, 14.) For because
they did ride on the high places of the earth; did eat the increase of the
fields and did suck the honey out of the Rock; and oil cut of the flinty
Rock; butter of Kine, and milk of Sheep, with fat of Lambs* etc. Therefore
lesurum waxed fat, grew thick, was covered with fatness, etc. Then he forsook
God which made him, and lightly esteemed the rock of his Salvation. Of the
Ro^^e that begat them they were unmindful, and did forget him that formed
them: (Deuteronomy. 32, 13.) Whereby it appears to be more easier for a Camel to go
through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven: Math. 19, 24. Isa. 26, 10. Hosea, 4, 7, 4, 11, 10, 1.13, 6. Daniel, 5,
4. Job. 21, 14, 21, 7. Iam, 2, 6. Prou. 23, 29. Eccl. 3, 11.

Ob. Who then can be saved? Math. 19 25.

A. With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible: (Math.
19, 26.) For by faith Moses when he was come to years, refused to be called
the Son of Pharoahs daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction, with the
people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the
reproaches of Christ greater riches, than the treasures of Egypt: Heb. 11, 24.

For the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, though the heart of the
fool is in the house of mirth: Eccl. 7, 4. Isa. 32, 5. Genesis 24.35.22, 12. Job.
1, 1. Dan. 1 12.

Q. Because of this, and such like examples, are we altogether to be without
fear, in the inioyment of earthly things?

A. When thou have eaten, and art full, beware that thou forget not the Lord
thy God, in not keeping his Commandments, and his judgments: (D^ut. 8, 10.)
For which en^, remember Lots wife: Luke 17, 32. Genesis 19.26, Deuteronomy. 6, 10, 11.

Q. How may we then be preserved from the danger of earthly things?

A. 1. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world: (1, Ioh,
2, 15.) For will thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? Prou. 23, 5.

2. Use this world as if you used it not, (1. Cor. 7, 31.) For no man that
warreth, intangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may
please him, who has chosen him to be a Soldier: etc. 2 Timothy 2, 4. Iam. 1.10,
11. Cant. 2, 10. Gal. 6, 14. Prou. 23, 1, 2, 3.

3 Pray, saying; Turn away mine eyes ^^om beholding vanity, and quicken thou
^^t in thy way: (Psalm. 119, 37.) Two things ^^ue I required of thee, deny me
them ^ut before I dye, remove far from me va^itie and lies; give me neither
Poverty ^^r Riches, feed me with food convenient for me; least I be full and
deny thee, and ^^y, Who is the Lord? Or least I be poor and steal, and take
the name of my God in ^aine. Prou. 30, 7.

Q. What further encouragement can ^ou give me to stand out against these ^o
many Temptations, of the Flesh, the Devil, and the World?

A. He that indureth to the end shall it saved: (Math. 10 22.) And to him that
overcommeth will I give to eat of the ^ree of Life, which is in the mids of
the Paradise of GOD: (Revel. 2, 7.) And to ^^te of the hidden Manna, and I will
give ^im a white stone, and in the stone, a new ^ame written, which no man
knows saving he that receives it: (Revel 2, 17.) He shall (also) be
clothed in white raiment, and I will not blot out his Name out of the book of
Life; but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his Angels.
(Reu. 3.5.) And will grant him to sit with me in my Throne, even as I also
overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne: Revel. 3.21, 3*
12.21.7. Luke 22.28.29.30 verses.

Q. What should this so rich and plentiful a reward moon us unto?

A. To walk circumspectly not as fools, but as wise: (Ephesians. 5.15.) And to
ponder the paths of thy feet, that thy ways may be establ^shed, and turn
not to the right hand nor to the left, but remove thy foot from evil: Prou.
4, 26, 27.

2. Pray that you fall not into temptation: (Math. 26, 41.) But that he would
grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might
serve him without fear, in holiness, and righteousness, before him, all the
days of ^^r life. Luke 1.74.

CHAP. XXXII. Of the Word of GOD.
IN the mids of so many Temptations on the right hand, and on ^e left, what
one means of upholding ^^th GOD left unto his Church?

A. When all Israel is come to appear ^^fore the Lord thy GOD, in the place
^here he shall choose, thou shall read this ^^w before all Israel, in their
hearing. ^oth of Men, and Women, and Chil^^n, and thy Stranger that is within
^y Gates; that they may hear, and that ^^y may learn, and fear the Lord your
^OD, and observe to do all the words (...) this Law; and that their Children
which have not known any thing, may ^^re, and learn to fear the LORD ^^r
GOD, as long as ye live: (Deuteronomy. ^, 11. Exodus 24, 7. Ios. 8, 34, 35.

Q. Why? what excellency is there in this law of GOD, more than in other
writings of men, whereby to work such a fear of God in our hearts?

A. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul; the of test^mony of
the Lord is sure, making wise the simple; the statutes of the Lord are right,
rejoicing the heart; the Commandment of the Lord is pure, inlightening the
eyes: (Psalm. 19, 7.) Not coming unto you in Word only, but also in Power, and
in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance: (1 Thessalonians. 1, 5.) Being able to make
thee wise unto Salvation, through Faith, which is in Christ Jesus; and is
profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for correction for instruction in
Righteousness, that the Man of GOD may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all
good works: (2 Timothy 3, 15.) For as the rain comes down, and the snow from
Heaven, and returns not thither, but waters the earth, and makes it to
bring forth, and bud, that it may give seed to the Sower, and Bread to the
eater; so shall my Word be that goes forth out of my ^outh; it shall not
return to me void; ^^t it shall accomplish that which I ^ease, and it shall
prosper in the thing ^hereto I send it: Deuteronomy. 32, 2. Isa. 55, 10. ^9, 2. Job,
6, 25. Eccles. 12, 11. Act. 26, ^8. Heb. 4, 12. Romans 10, 17.

Thus the Churches were by the Word, established in the Faith: (Acts, 16, 5.)
And I am sure also, that when I come unto you, I shall come in the fullness of
the blessing of the Gospel of CHRIST: Romans 15, 29. Col. 1, 6. Acts, 4, 4.18,
8. 17, 11, 12, 34. verses, 12, 24, 17, 4, 15, 32, 8. 12, 24, 25. Ioh. 15, 3.

Q. Whence has the Scripture this power, and efficacy?

A. Thus says the Lord thy Redeemer, the holy One of Israel; I am the Lord thy
GOD, which teach thee to profit, which leads thee by the way that thou
should go: (Isa. 48, ^7.) I create the fruit of the lips; peace, peace, to
him that is far off, and to him that is near: (Isa. 57, 19.) It is written
in the Prophets, and they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that
heard, and has learned of the Father, comes unto me. Ioh. 6, 45.

Who then is PAVL? And who is APOLLO? But the Ministers by whom ye believed;
even as the Lord gave to every man. I have planted, APOLLO watered, but GOD
gave the increase* So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he
that waters, but God that gives the increase: (1. Cor. 3, 5.) So that your
Faith stands not in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Howbeit we
speak wisdom, among them that are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this
World, nor of the Princes of this world, that comes to naught; but we speak
the wisdom of God in a mystery; even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained
before the World, unto our glory. ^^ Cor. 2, 4.) Whereunto I also labor,
^^^iving according to his working, which (...) ^^th in me mightily: (Col. 1,
29.) For (...) ^use also thank we God without cea^ ^^cause when ye received
the Word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it, ^ut as the word of
men; but as it is in truth ^^e word of God; which effectually also wor^^th in
you that believe: (1 Thessalonians. 2, 13.) ^lessed therefore art thou Simon Bar-lo^^^,
for flesh, and blood, has not revealed (...) unto thee, but my Father which is
in Heaven: Mat. 16, 17. Mark. 17 20. 2. Tim. ^, 16. 1 Cor. 1, 18. Act. 15,
17.10, 44. Gal. 2, ^, 1.11, 12. M^cha, 3, 8.

Q. But is every part of the Word, for ^he working of grace, of like efficacy?

A. This only would I learn of you; received you the Spirit, by the works of
the Law, or by the hearing of Faith? (Gal. 3, ^.) For which cause I am not
ashamed of ^he Gospel of CHRIST; for that is the ^ower of God unto Salvation,
to every one that believes: (Romans 1, 16.) For if the ministration of death;
written, and ingra^^n in stones was glorious; so that the children of Israel
could not steadfastly behold the face of MOSES, for the glory of his
countenance; which glory was to be done ^way: how shall not that ministration
of the Spirit, be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be
glory, much more does the ministration of Righteousness exeeed in glory. For
even that which was made glorious, had no glory, in this respect, by reason of
the glory that excels. For if that which was done away was glorious, much
more that which remains is glorious: 2. Cor. 3.7.1.1.21.

Q. What in lieu of this Word does God require of us?

A. Because he has showed his word unto Jacob, and his Statutes, and his
judgments unto Israel; and has not dealt so with every Nation; and for his
judgments they have not known them, therefore praise ye the Lord: Psalm. 147.19.

Q. Why? do all such as have the Word, reap benefit thereby?

A. No; for GOD shall smite the Earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the
breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked: (Ia. 11.4.) And we are unto God a
sweet savor of CHRIST; in them that are saved, and in them that perish. To the
one we are the savor of death unto death, and to the other, the savou^ of l^fe
unto life: 2, Cor. 2.15.

Q. Has the word one and the same entertainment among all them that perish?

A. No; for when PAVL disputed of Righteousness, and Temperance, and of the
Judgment to come, Faelix trembled: Acts, 24, 25.

2 Herod he heard John gladly, and did many things: (Mark. 6, 20.) Unto others
the Word of the Lord is a reproach; they have no delight in it: Ier. 6.10.

3 The Princes and people of Israel, when they heard the Word of the Lord, let
their Servants go free, but afterward repented: Ier. 34, 10, 11.

4 When JEREMIAH preached the Word of the Lord, to the Jews that went down
into Egypt, to soiourne there, they would not at all hearken to him: (Ier. 44,
16.) And from the preaching of Zachariah, they pulled away the shoulder, and
stopped their ears, that they should not hear; yea they made their hearts as
an Adamant stone, least they should hear the Law, and the words which the Lord
of Hosts has sent in his spirit, by the ministry of the Prophets: Zach. 7,
11. Ier. 6, 16.44, 3.4.32.23. 2, Chron. 24, 19, 2, 33, 10. Hos. 7, 1. Ezekiel. 33,
30.

5 Others mocking said; these men are full of new wine: (Act, 2.13.) And with
their mouths make Jests: Ezekiel. 33.31. Ier. 20.7, 8, 9. Acts. 17, 32, 17, 18.2,
Chron. 36, 16.

6 And the multitude of the Jews, when they heard PAVL, cried, and said, Away
with such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he should live; and
as they cried out, they cast off their clothes, and threw dust in the Air.
(Acts 22, 22.) And when PAVL sent into Macedonia, Timothius and Erastus, there
arose no small stir also about that way, (Acts 19, 22) And when the Jews heard
Steven they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth,
Acts, 7.54.

7 Others make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that
reprooveth in the Gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of naught: Isa.
29, 21. Mat. 10.34.

Q. What are the reasons of so much profane, and unprofitable hearing of the
Word?

A. Some it profits not; because it is not mixed with faith, in them that
hear it: Heb. 4, 2. Acts 28, 24 19.9.

2 Herod would not part with Herodias, and therefore JOHN touching him upon
that sin, he cast him into prison: (Mark. 6, 17.) And so every man that evil
does, hates the light; neither comes to the light, least his deeds should
be reprooved: Ioh. 3, 20. Ezekiel. 33, 31.

3 They are but natural, not having the spirit: (Iud. 19.) And the natural
man perceives not the things of the spirit of God; because they are
spiritually discerned. 1, Cor. 2, 14.1, Cor. 2, 11.1, 2, 6, 7.8. Hos. 8.12.
Ier. 6, 10. Act. 17, 20. Math. 11, 27, 13.11, 11, 25, 26.

4 God has given them the Spirit of slumber; eyes that they should not see,
and ears that they should not hear unto this day: (Romans 11.8.) For it is
written I will destroy the w^sedome of the wise, and will cast away the
understanding of the prudent* says the LORD 1, Cor. 1 19. Isa. 6, 10 44.18.

5 If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; whom the God of this
world, has blinded the minds of them that believe not; that the light of the
glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the image of God, should not shine unto
them: 2, Corinth. 4, ^.

6 Some are hindered by the pride of their outward greatness, and therefore not
the rich, but the poor receive the Gospel: (M^t 11.5) For says Amazia unto
Amos, O thou Seer, go flee thee away into the Land of Judah, and there eat
bread, and Prophecy there. But Prophecy not again any more at Bethel: for it
is the Kings Chapel, and it is the Kings Court: Amos, 7, 12.

7 Others think they are rich, and increased with goods, and have need of
nothing; not knowing how they are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
blind, and naked: (Reu. 3 17.) And therefore being full, they despise the honey
Comb; Whereas to the hungry Soul, every bitter thing is sweet: Prou. 27, 7.
Ioh. 9, 39* 1, Cor. 1, 19.

Q. What are the dangers which do a^tend the contempt, and abuse of the Word?

1. A Famine; not of Bread, but of hearing the Word of the Lord: (Amos, 8, 11,
12.) For which cause Paul, and Barnabas turned from the Jews, unto the
Gentiles: Acts, 13, 46.18.6, 16, 6. Ioh. 12, 35. 1, Sam. 28, 6. 2, Chron. ^5,
3. Ezekiel. 7, 26. Amos, 8, 9.

2. Vnrecoverable dest^^ction. Because says God, I have called and ye have
refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but you have set at
naught all my Counsel, and would none of my reproof; I also will laugh at
your calamity, and I will mock when your fear comes: (Prou. 1, 24.) And
then as I cried, and you would not hear; so you shall cry, and I will not
hear: (Ier, 11, 11.) But I will do unto you as I have done to Shiloh; and I
will cast you out, as I have cast out all your Brethren; even the whole seed of
Ephraim: Io. ^7.13. etc.

For the Earth which drinks in the Rain that comes often upon it, and yet
bears thorns, and briars, is rejected and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is
to be burned: Heb. 6.7, 10, 28. Hos. 6.5. Deuteronomy. 17, 12. Revel. 2, 16. Math. 12,
41. 2, Chron. 36, 14, etc. Ierom. 11, 6. Nehem. 9, 29. Ezekiel. 34, 13, 33, 33.
Prou. 13.13

Q. What use are we to make of all this?

A. Therefore suffer the words of exhortation: (Heb. 13, 22.) And hear what
the spirit says to the Churches* (Reu. 3, 13) That so the word of God may
dwell in you plenteously in all wisdom, (Col. 3, 16) For why should their be
a price put into the hand of a Fool to get wisdom, and he has no heart?
(Prou. 17, 16.) Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather
than choice gold; for wisdom is better than rubies, and all the things that
may be desired, are not to be compared to it: (Prou, 8, 10.) Therefore buy the
truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding:
(Prou. 23, 23.) Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear and your soul shall
live: Isa. 55, 3. 1, These. 5, 20. Heb. 12, 25. Prou. 8, 33, 16, 16.1, 20, 22,
23, 8, 12, 9. 1, Iam. 1, 21. Job. 22, 22. 2, Cor. 6, 11. Luke 10, 41. Deuteronomy. 11,
18 4, 9, Luke 2, 18. Reu. 1, 3.

2 Take heed therefore, how you hear, for whosoever has to him shall be
given: and whosoever has not, from him shall be taken, even that which he
seems to have: (Luke 8, 18.) And with what measure you mete, it shall be
measured to you: Mark. 4, 24.

Q. Tell us therefore how we may hear the Word with fruit?

A. 1. H^are it diligen^ly. my Son if thou will receive my words and hide my
Commandments with thee; so that thou will incline thine ear unto wisdom,
and apply thine heart unto understanding; yea if thou cryest after knowledge
and liftest up thy voice for understanding: If thou seek her as silver, and
searchest for her, as for hid treasures: then shall thou understand the fear
of the LORD, and find the knowledge of GOD: Prou. 2, 1, 1, 5, 6.

2 Lay aside all malice, and guile and Hypocrisies, and enuies, and
evil-speakings: (1. Pet. 2; 1.) And all filthiness, and superfluity of
naughtines Iam. 1, 21.) And break up your fallow ground, and sow not among
thorns. Circumcise your selves to the Lord, and take away the fore skins of
your hearts: Ier. 4.3 4.

3 As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word, that you may grow
thereby: (1. Pet. 2.2.) For wheresoever the Carcass is, thither will the Eagles
resort: Math. 24.28.

4 Receive with meekness the ingrafted lord, which is able to save your
Souls: (^. Iam. 21.) And let no man deceive ^^mselfe; for if any man among you
would (...) wise in this World, let him become a ^oole that he may be wise:
(1. Cor. 3, 18.) For JESUS said, For Judgment I am ^^me into this World, that
they which see ^ut, might see, and they which see might (...) made blind, Ioh.
9 39. Math. 11.25 26.5 Pray saying; 1. Open thou mine eyes, that may behold the
wondrous things of thy ^^w. I am a stranger on earth; hide not thy
^^mmandements from me. (Psalm. 119.18.) will praise thee with uprightness of
heart ^hen I shall have learned thy righteous ^^dgements. Psalm. 119.7.27 33, 34
73.125.69.171. verses.

2 Pray, O that my ways were directed (...) keep thy statutes, then shall I
not be asha^^d, when I have respect unto all thy com^andements, (Psalm. 1^ 9.5.)
with my whole ^^art have I sought thee, O let me not wan^^r from thy
commandments, (119.10.) ^eale bountifully with thy servant, that I may live,
and keep thy word, (119.17.) Let my heart be sound in thy statutes, that I be
not ashamed, (119, 80.) Order my steps in thy word, and let not any iniquity
have dominion over me: 119.133.

6 Be ye dooers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own
souls. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not ^ dooer; he is like unto a
man, beholding hi^ natural face in a glass; for he beholdet^ himself, and
goes his way, and strait wa^ forgets what manner of man he wa^ But who so
looks into the perfect law o^ liberty, and continues therein; he no^ being a
forgetful hearer, but a dooer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his
deed. Iam. 1.22, Deuteronomy. 4, 5.5.1.30, 11. Luke 11* 28. 1 Thessalonians. 4.1. Ephesians. 4.17.
Phil. 4.8. Romans 2, 13. Revel. 1.3. 1 Pet. 4.6. Math 7.24.

Ob. I have done my poor endeavor to observe these rules, yet when I am
present at the word, I cannot keep my mind from wandering.

A. The ears of them that hear, shall hearken. (Isa. 32.3.) And the ears of
the deaf shall be opened, (Isa. 35.5.) For he ^akeneth morning, by morning,
he will waken thine ear, to hear, as the learned, (Isa. 50.4.) Or as he
opened the heart of LIDDEA, whereby she attended unto the things which were
spoken by PAVL, (Act. 16.14.) Whereby thou shall be able to say, ^eake LORD,
for thy servant hears. ^. Sam. 3.9. Neh. 8.3. Act. 8.6. Luke 19.^8.

Ob. The Scripture is a book so fast sealed, and I my self, am a man so dull
of conceit, that I cannot understand the ^^me. Isa. 28.9. etc.

A. The entrance in to GODS word gives light; it gives understanding to the
simple. (Psalm. 119, 130.) Whereby they that err in spirit, shall come to
understanding, and they that murmur shall learn Doctrine. (Isa. 29.24.) The
people that walk in darkness, have ^^ene a great light, and they that ^well
in the land of the shadow of death, upon them has the light shined, (Isa.
9.2.) For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in
your hearts; to give the light of the knowledge of God, in the face of JESUS
CHRIST. 2 Cor. 4 6.

I have (indeed) spoken unto you in Proverbes, but the time comes, when I
shall no more speak to you in proverbes, but I shall show you plainly of the
Father: (Ioh. 16, 25.) In that day, shall the deaf hear the words of this
Book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of
darkness: Isa. 29, 18, 35, 5, 32, 2 50 4. Prou. 1, 1, 4, 8, 9. 1 Cor. 2, 10,
12. Nehem. 8 8. Luke 24 45. Tit. 1, 3. Mal. 2.7. Deuteronomy. 17 8.9. Reu. 5.5.8.

Now therefore thanks be unto God, which always makes manifest, the savor
of his Knowledge by us in every place: (2 Cor. 2.14.) For there is Gold, and a
multitude of precious Stones; but the lips of Knowledge are a precious jewel:
Prou. 20.15. Neh. 8.12. Math. 11.25.

Ob. But I am so hard-hearted, that I can not be affected with the Word?

A. I will put a new Spirit within you, and I will take the stony heart out of
thy flesh, and I will give thee an heart of Flesh: (Ezekiel. 11.19) As well as to
the Iew^s who wept when they heard the words of the Law; (Neb. 8.9.) For is not
my Word l^ke a fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer, that breaks the
Rocks in pieces? Ier. 23, 29.26.18. Ioh. 5.25. Act. 2.37, 16.29.

2 His words were found; and I did eat them, and they were unto me, the joy
and rejoicing of my heart: (Ier. 15, 16.) I will therefore delight my self in
his Statutes: (Psalm. 119.16.) How sweet is his Word unto my taste? Yea sweeter
then honey to my mouth: (Psalm. 119.103.) Therefore my Son eat thou honey,
because it is good, and the honey comb, which is sweet to thy taste. So shall
the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul, when thou have found it: Prou.
24.13. Act. 15.31.13.48. Job, 23.12. Act. 2.41. Psalm. 119.16.17.111.174.162.
verses. Luke 24.32.

Ob. I am no sooner gone from the Word, but all is forgotten?

A. The Comforter which is the holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
name; he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you. (Ioh. 14.26.) Whereby MARY kept all those
things in her heart, which were told her by the Shepherds. (Luke 2.19.)
Neither did I forget Gods word. Psalm. 119.16. 2. Pet. 1.12.13.

Ob. The hardest task is yet behind, to wit; to put in practice what we hear?

A. I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in
the paths that they have not known; I will make darkness light before them,
and crocked things straight, says the LORD. (Isa. 42.16.) Who has opened mine
ears and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward, (Isa. 50.5.) Yea
I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep his word,
(Psalm. 119.101.) So that when he said seek ye my face, my heart said unto
him, thy face LORD will I seek: (Psalm. 27.8.) For this is the love of GOD that
we keep (...) Commandments, and his commandments are not grievous: 1 Ioh. 5,
3. Hag. 1, 12. Psalm. 119, 15, 48, 57, 104, ^ 68. Math. 13, 8.23. Col. 1, 6.
Luke 1.5, ^, 2. Chron. 17, 6.

CHAP. XXXIII. Of Ministers.
Ob. YOu tell me of the Word, and the great benefit thereof; but how should I
either know, or do what the Word teaches, without a guide? Act. ^, 31.

A. When CHRIST ascended up on high he gave gifts unto men, etc. and he gave
some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors, and
Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry,
for ^he edifying of the Body of CHRIST; till we all eome in the unity of faith,
and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
of the stature, of the fullness of Christ: (Ephesians. 4.8.11.) And therefore though
the LORD give you the bread of Adversity, and the water of Affliction, yet thy
Teachers shall not be removed into a corner any more; but thine eyes shall see
thy Teachers: (Isa. 30.20.) For the Lord gives the Word, great is the company
of Preachers: Psalm. 68.11. Ier. 33.18. Leuit. 10, 11. Isa. 41.27. Isa 62.6.

Q. But shall we have such Pastors, as will deal faithfully with us?

A. I will give you Pastors according to mine own heart; which shall feed you,
with knowledge, and understanding: (Ier. 3, 15.) Who will very gladly spend,
and be spent for you: (2. Cor. 12.15.) As Moses who was faithful in all his
house: (Heb. 3.5.) And as of Leui it was said the Law of truth is in his mouth,
and iniquity was not found in his lips; he walked with me in peace, and
equity: and did turn away many from iniquity: Mal. 2, 6.

Moreover ye know from the first day, that Paul came into Asia, after what
manner he has been with you, at all seasons: serving the Lord with all
humbleness of mind, and with many tears, and temptations: which befell him,
by the lying in wait of the Jews: and how he kept back nothing, that was
profitable unto you: (Act, 20.18.) And you know the proof of Timothy; that as
a Son with the Father he has served with Paul in the Gospel: (Phil. 2 22.)
And for the work of Christ, he was nigh unto death; not regarding his life:
(Phil. 2, 30.) And daily in the Temple, and in every house, the Disciples
ceased not to teach, and to preach JESUS CHRIST: (Acts, 5, 42.) These are not
as many, which corrupt the Word of God; but as of sincerity; but as of God, in
the sight of God, speak they in Christ: 2, Cor. 2, 17* 11, 23, 1, 9, 27, 1,
9.19.2, Chron 17* 9, 8, 13. Col. 4, 7, 10, 11, 1* 7. Act, 20, 23.30, 31, 18,
24. Ezekiel. 34, 23. Hag. 1, 13. 1, These. 5 6, 7. Ier. 23, 4, 4, 19. 8, 21, 9, 1,
3, 17. Ezra. 7, 6, 10. 1. Sam. 3, 21.

Q. Wherefore are these promises recorded in Gods word, concerning his
Ministers?

A. 1. That they may be apt to teach: (1, Tim. 3.2.) And therefore give
attendance unto reading: (1. Tim. 4 1^) And study to show ^he^selues workmen
that need not to be ashamed: dividing the Word of truth aright: (2, Tim. 2,
^5.) For every Scribe taught unto the Kingdom of Heaven: is like unto a man,
that is a householder: which brings forth out of his treasury, things both
new, an old: Math. 13, 52.

2 That they be diligent, to know the state of their flocks, and to look well
to their herds: (Prou. 27, 23.) Taking the oversight thereof: (1, Pet. 5, 2.)
For they are set for a defense, and fortress among the people: that they may
know, and try their ways: Ier. 6, 27.

3 That they feed the flock of GOD, which is among you: (1, Pet. 5, 2.) And
preach the word, and be instant; in season, and out of season: to reprove,
rebuke, exhort, with all long suffering, and doctrine: (2, Tim. 4, 2,) Not
shunning to declare the whole Council of God: (Acts, 20.27) But to cry aloud;
and lift up their voice l^ke a Trumpet; to show my people their transgression,
and the house of Jacob their sins: (Isa. 58, 1.) And in the Spirit, and power
of Elias, to turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children: and the
disobedient, to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for
the Lord: (Luke 1, 17.) Exhorting them that with full purpose of heart, they
would cleave unto the Lord: (Act, 11.23.) Exorting the elder women as mothers:
the younger women, as sisters, with all purity: 1, T^m. 5, 2.

Wherein if any man speak, let him speak as the Oracles of GOD: (1, Pet. 4,
11,) The Prophet that has a Dream, let him tell a Dream; and he that has
my Word, let him speak my Word faithfully; what is the Chafe to the Wheat,
says the LORD? Ierem. 23, 28. 1, Co^* 9, 16. 1. Pet. 5, 4 Job, 21, 15. Math.
28, 19, 20. Isa. 62, 1, 2. 2, Timoth. 2, 24. Amos, 3 7.

4 Not to be as Lords over Gods heritage; but as ensamples to the flock: (1,
Pet. 5, 3.) Giving no offense in any thing, that their Ministry be not blamed;
but in all things approving themselves as the Ministers of God: (2, Cor. 6, 3.)
Performing the same not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but
of a ready mind: 1, Pet. 5, 2. 1, Timoth. 3, 1. Math. 23, 8.

Q How does GOD tax the negligence of his Priests under the Law?

A. I have seen (says GOD) foolishness in the Prophets of Samaria; that
prophecy in Baal* and caused my people Israel to err. I have seen also in
the Prophets of Jerusalem, filthiness; they commit adultery, and walk in
lies; they strengthen also the hands of the wicked, that none can return from
his wickedness: (Ier. 23, 13.) They prophecy lies in my name, saying; I have
dreamed, I have dreamed; yea they are Prophets of the deceit of their own
heart: (Ier. 23 25.) They have healed also, the hurt of the Daughter of my
people slightly saying; Peace, peace: when there is no peace: (Ier. 6, 19.)
Others they bite with the teeth, and he that puts not into their mouths,
they even prepare war against him: Mich. 3, 5, 1^.

Some of them also are blind* they are ignorant, they are dumb Dogs, they
cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber: yea they are greedy
Dogs, which can never have enough: and they are Shepherds, that cannot
understand, they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his
quarter: (Isa. 56, 10.) All these shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men:
for they neither go in themselves, neither suffer them that are entering in, to
go in: Math: 23, 13. Ierem. 10, 21, 8 11. 23, 16, 17, 5, 30, 31. Ezekiel. 13, 6,
7. Zephan. 3, 4. Mal. 2, 9.

Q. How does GOD threaten such Priests under the Law?

A. T^a^ their way should be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness; and
ha^ they should be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon
them; even the year of their visitation, says the Lord? (Ier. 23, 12.) And I
will require my Flock at their hands: (Ezekiel. 34.10.) And mine hand shall be
upon the Prophets, that see vanity, and divine lies: they shall not be in the
Assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the
House of Israel: (Ezekiel. 13, 9.) And they shall bear their punishment; the
punishment of the Prophet, shall be, even as the punishment of him that asks:
(Ezekiel, 14, 10.) And because they make many to stumble at the Law, and have
corrupted the Covenant of ^eui; therefore will I make them contemptible, and
base before all the people: (Mal. 2, 8) Night shall be unto them, that they
shall not have a Vision; and it shall be dark unto them, and they shall not
divine, and the Sun shall go down over the Prophets, and the day shall be
dark over them. Then shall they be ashamed, and confounded; yea they shall
cover their lips; for there is no answer from GOD: Mich. 3, 6.

Ob. But are not Gods Ministers, even now under the Gospel, discouraged by
their people, and flickr, for their deadness, and dullness, in their works of
piety and devotio^?

Son of man, I have made them Watchmen to the house of Israel; therefore they
should have heard the Word at my mouth, and have given them warning from me.
So that when I have said unto the wicked, thou shall surely dye: and thou have
not given him warning, nor spakest to admonish the wicked from his wiked way,
that he might live; the same wicked man shall dye in his iniquity; but his
blood will I require at their hand. Yet if they had warned the wicked, and he
turn not from his wickedness: nor from his wicked way he shall dye in his
iniquity; but such Ministers should have delivered their own soul: Ezekiel. 3,
17, 33, 2, 2, 8, 2, 4, 5. Isay, 49, 4 5.

Ob. Some of these might have been more faithful in their Ministry, if in
the discharge thereof, they did with godly Zeal, and discreet courage express
themselves, and their Consciences?

A. Therefore say unto such a one, thus says the Lord; If thou take away the
precious from the vile, thou shall be according to my word; let them return
unto thee: but return not thou unto them. And I will make thee unto this
people a strong brazen Wall, and they shall fight against thee; but they shall
not preva^le against thee: for I am with thee to save thee. And I will deliver
thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of
the tyrants: Ier. 15.19.

Thou therefore trusse up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that
I ^^mmand thee: be not afraid of their fa^^s, least I destroy thee before them:
Ier. ^, 17, 20.11.26, 24. Ezekiel. 2.6, 3, 9, 2, 4, 5.

Q. I now see the work of a Minister to be of importance: what therefore is
the peoples duty toward ^im?

A. Against an Elder receive not an ^ccusation under two, or three witnes^es:
1, Tim, 5 19.

2 Say to A chippus look well to thy Min^sterie thou have received in the
LORD, that thou fulfill it: Colos. 4, 17.

3 Because the Harvest is great, and the laborers are few* therefore pray ye
to the Lord of the Harvest that he would send forth more Laborers into his
Harvest: Math. 9, 37.

2 Say, let thy Priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy Saints
showt for joy: Psalm. 132.9.

3 As of LEVI it was said, Let thy Vrim, and thy Thummim, be with thy holy
ones, (Deuteronomy. 33 8.) That utterance also may be given ^e^ that they may open
their mouths boldly; to make known the mysteries of the Gospel: (Ephesians.
6.19. Col. 4.3 4,) That so, for the gift bestowed upon us, by the means of
many persons; thanks may be given by many, on our behalf. 2. Cor. 1.11.

4 That they may be delivered from unreasonable, and wicked men; because all
men have not faith: 2 Thessalonians. 3.2. Romans 15.30.

5 That their service may be acceptable to the Saints. Romans 15.31.

6 Finally pray, that the word of the Lord may have a free course, and be
glorified: 2. Th^ss. 3, 1.

4 Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teaches in
al^ good things: (Gal. 6.6.) For the scripture says, thou shall not mousle the
mouth of the Ox, that treads out the co^ne. And the laborer is worthy of his
reward, (1. Tim 5.18.) If ye be made partaker of their spiritual things, your
duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things: (Romans 15, 27.) For will a
man rob GOD? (Mal. 3.8.) Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatsoever a
man sows, that shall he also reap. For he that sows to his flesh, shall of
the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit, shall of the
Spirit reap Life everlasting: Gal. 6, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 9.7. Mal. 3, 9, 10. Genesis
47.22. Deuteronomy. 12.19. 2 Chronicles. 31 4, 5.

5 Let the Elders which rule well be ^ounted worthy of double honor;
especi^lly they, who labor in the Word, and Do^trine: (1 Timothy 5.17.) And let
no man desp^se such: (1 Cor. 16, 11.) but esteem them very highly, in love;
for their works sake: 1 Thessalonians. 5, 12.

6. Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your selves; for they
watch for your Souls; as they that must give an account, that they may do it
with joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you: (Heb. 13.7. 1
Cor. 16.16.) Therefore do according to that thing which they show you;
according to the Law which they shall teach you; and according to the
judgment, which they shall tell you, shall you do: you shall not decline from
the thing which they shall show you; neither to the right hand, nor to the
left: Deuteronomy. 17, 10. Heb. 13 7.

Q. What is the danger of such as do not honor, but do offer wrong, and
dishonor to their Minister?

A. If any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and
devoureth their Enemies. And if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner
be killed; For these have power to shut Heaven, that it rain not in the days
of their Prophecy; and have power over Waters, to turn them to Blood, and to
strike the Earth with all plagues, as often as they will: Reu. 11.5.

Ob. I would be loath to hurt our Minister; but yet what if his life be not
answerable to his Doctrine?

A. Though he be as wicked, as were the Scribes, and Pharisees; yet he sits in
MOSES seat; all therefore whatsoever he bids you observe, that observe, and
do; but after his works do not; because he says, and does not* Math. 23, 2.

Ob. But he is also so unlearned a man, that in one Sermon of many, you shall
not hear one word of Latin, or Gre^ke, to come out of his mouth?

A. Brethren if your Minister come unto you speaking with tongues what shall he
profit you; except he shall speak to you, either by Revelation, or by
Knowledge, or by Prophesying, or by Doctrine? And even things without life,
giving sound; whether Pipe, or Harp; except they give a distinction in the
sounds; how shall it be known, what is piped, or harped? For if the Trumpet
give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? So
likewise we, except we utter by the tongue words easy to be understood; how
shall it be known what is spoken? For we shall speak into the air. There are
it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world; and none of them are without
signication. Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to
him that speaks a Barbarian; and he that speaks shall be a barbarian unto
me. 1. Cor. 14.6.1.14.2.14.21.

Ob. It seems you are an English Preacher; you plead so much against tongues?

A. I thank my GOD, I speak languages more then they all; yet in the Church I
had rather speak five words, with my understanding, that by my voice I might
teach others also; then ten thousand words in a strange tongue. 1. Cor.
14.18.19.

Ob. Whatsoever you allege against the use of tongues, yet as I hope, you will
not deny, unto such Ministers, the greatest praise, as are most eloquent?

A. The things of GOD we speak; not in the words, which man's wisdom
teaches; but which the holy Ghost teaches; comparing spiritual things, with
spiritual, (1, Cor. 2.1^.) that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of
men, but in the power of God. (1. Cor. 2.5.) For CHRIST ^nt me to preach the
Gospel; not with wisdom of words, least the cross (...) CHRIST, should be
made of none ^fect. (1. Cor. 1.17.) But seeing the ^orld by wisdom knew not
GOD; (...) pleased GOD, by the foolishness of ^reaching, to save them that
believe: ^1. Cor. 1.21.) We have therefore re^^unced, the hidden things of
dishone^ie; not walking in craftiness, nor ^^ndling the Word of GOD
deceitful^^; but by the manifestation of the truth, commending our selves to
every ^ans Conscience, in the sight of GOD. ^. Corinth. 4.2.) Not Preaching our
^^lues; but CHRIST JESUS the LORD, and our selves your ser^^ants for JESUS
sake. 2. Cor. 4.5. ^.2.1.

Ob. Then as it seems to you, every Minister as well for matter as manner of
^eaching must suite himself to the capacity of his auditorie, etc.

A. True. For we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered. Not because
we cannot speak them; but because you are dull of hearing. For when for the
time you ought to be Teachers; you have need that one teach you again which
be the first principles of the Oracles of God, and are become such as have
need of milk, and not of strong meat. For every one that uses milk, is
unskillful in the word of Righteousness; for he is a Babe: (Heb. 5 11.) And I
brethren could not speak unto you, as unto Spiritual men, but as unto
Carnal; even as unto babes in CHRIST. I have fed you with Milk, and not with
Meat, for hitherto ye were not able, to bear it; neither yet now are ye
able: 1. Cor. 3, 1, 2.

Q. Are we therefore always to be dea^t withal like Children, and to be fed
like Babes?

A. No longer than while ye become unto full age, and are such as have your
senses exercised, to d^scerne both good, and evil: (Heb. 5.14) Whereby it
appearing that you are become strong men; then leaving the principles of the
doctrine of CHRIST, let us go on unto perfection; not laying the foundation of
Repentance, from dead works, and of faith toward GOD; of the Doctrine of
Baptismes, and of laying on of hands, and of the Resurrection from the dead,
and of eternal Judgment: Heb. 6, 1.

Q It neither the frequent use of tongues: nor humane eloquence: nor deep, and
profound teaching, be of esteem with you: I pray tell me wherein you
Ministers are in your teaching, most praise worth^?

A. Do we begin again to commend our selves; or need we as some others,
Epistles of commendations to you; or letters of commendations from you? Ye are
our Epistle, written in our hearts, known, and read of all men. For as much as
ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ, ministered by us;
written not with Ink, but with the spirit of the living God; not in tables of
stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart. And such trust have we through
Christ to Godward, not that we are sufficient of our selves; but our
sufficiency is of God; who has also made us able Ministers, of the new
Testament; not of the Letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter kills, but
the Spirit gives life: (2, Cor. 3, 1.) And are not you my work in the LORD?
If I be not an Apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you; for the Seal
of my Apostleship, are ye in the LORD: 1, Corinth. 9, 1, 2.

Q But why should GOD use the Ministry of men, and not of Angels?

A. We have this treasure in earthen vessels; that the excellency of the
power, may be of GOD, and not of us: 2, Cor. 4, 7.

2 Every high Priest, taken from among men, is ordained for men, in things
pertaining to God; that he may offer both gifts, and sacrifices for sins, who
can have compassion on the ignorant, and of them, that are out of the way; for
that he himself also is compassed with infirmity: Heb. 5, 1, 2.

Ob. The case so being, Christ Jesus himself, being both God, and Man: had
been a Minister, without all exception?

A. I tell you the truth: it was expedient for you, that he go away; for if
he had not gone away, the Comforter would not come unto you; but in that he
departed, he has sent him unto you, etc. Who being come, he does guide you
into all truth: etc. (Ioh. 16, 7, 13.) Let men therefore teach, to observe, all
things whatsoever he commands you; and lo he is with you, even unto the
end of the World: Matthew, 28, 20.

CHAP. XXXIIII. Of the Sacraments.
Ob. IF the Ministry of the Word be no less efficatious, then as you have
said it is; what further need is there of the Sacraments?

A. Circumcision verily profits: (Romans 2, 25.) For Abraham received the sign
of Circumcision: a Seal of the righteousness of Faith: (Romans 4.11. Act, 7,
8.) In whom you also are circumcised, with the Circumcision made without hands:
in putting off the body of the sins, of the flesh; by the Circumcision of
CHRIST: Col. 2, 11. Deuteronomy, 10, 16.

Q What promise has GOD made to B^ptisme?

A. Tha^ he will baptize thee with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. (Math. 3,
11.) For by one spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews
or Gentiles; whether we be bond or free: (1, Cor. 12, 13.) Whereby Baptism
does now save us: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh; but the
answer of a good conscience toward God, by the Resurrection of JESUS CHRIST:
1, Pet. 3, 21. Acts, 16, 14. Luke 7, 29, 30.

Q. Unto whom does this belong?

A. 1, To the Ministers, that they teach all Nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Math 28, 19.

2 To the people, to do as the publicans; who justified GOD, being baptized
with the baptism of John. And not to ^o as the Pharisees, and Lawyers, who
rejected the counsel of God against themselves: being not baptized of him:
Luk, 7, 29.30. Genesis 17, 14.

Q. See th^n, here is water: what does hinder me to be baptized? Acts 8, 36.

A, 1 If thou beleevest with all thine heart thou may? (Act, 8 37) For can
any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the
Holy Ghost as well as we? Act^, 10.47.

2 You must amend your lives, (Act. 2, 38.) And circumcise the foreskin of
your heart: (Deuteronomy. 10.16.) And then be baptized every one of you in the name of
JESUS CHRIST: Acts, 2, 38.

Ob. If Faith, and Repentance be necessary unto Baptism: seeing Infants
cannot actually believe, nor repent; are they therefore to be excluded from
this Sacrament?

A. Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is
the Kingdom of God: (Math. 19.14.) And if the root be holy so are the
branches: (Romans 11, 16.) For the promise was made to Abraham, and his seed:
Gal. 3, 16. Genesis 17, 2, 7* 17, 12, 21, 4. Acts, 2, 39.

Q Does the efficacy of Baptism depend on the worthiness of the Minister?

A. No: but on whom, thou shall see the Spirit descend, and remain on him; the
same is he that does Baptize, with the Holy Ghost: (Ioh. 1, 33) John in deed
baptized with Water: but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost: Math. 3,
11.

Q. What need then is there of the Supper of the Lord?

A. The Cup of blessing which we bless: is it not the Communion of the blood
of Christ? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the body of
Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers
of that one bread: (1, Cor. 10, 16.) Therefore says Christ; take, eat, this
is my body: and of the Cup, drink ye all of it: for this is my blood of the
new Testament, which is shed for many, for the Remission of sins: (Math.
26.26.) This do as often as ye do it, in remembrance of me. For as often as
ye eat of this bread, and drink of this Cup, ye do show the Lords Death
till he come: 1, Corinth. 11, 25, 11, 23.

Q. May any profane person be admitted unto the Supper of the Lord?

A. No: for if any shall eat of this bread, and drink of this Cup of the Lord
unworthily, he shall be guilty of the body and Blood of the LORD: and he
eats, and drinks Judgment to himself, not discerning the Lords body: 1,
Cor. 11.27, 29.

Moreover they cannot drink the Cup of the Lord and the Cup of Devils: they
cannot be partakers of the Lords Table and the Table of Devils: (1, Cor. 10,
21.) For thus says the LORD GOD: no stranger uncircumcised in heart, nor
uncircumcised in flesh; shall enter into my Sanctuary, that is among the
Children of Israel: Exek. 44, 9. Ezod. 12 48. Leuit. 2, 13.

Q. What is then to be done before our coming unto this Sacrament?

A. Let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of
that cup: (1, Cor. 11, 28) Also if a stranger shall soiourne among you, and
will keep this Supper unto the Lord: according to the ordinance, and according,
to the manner thereof; so shall he do: (Numb. 9, 14.) Who if he do also judge
himself: he shall not be judged. 1 Cor. 11, 31.

Ob. This search I have made, and can find but one sin, which I desire to
retai^e; now the good Lord be merciful unto thy Servant in th^s point: 2,
Kin^, 5, 18.

A. Know ye not that a little leaven, ^^aveneth the whole Lump? Purge ^ut
therefore the old leaven, that ye may (...) a new lump as ye are now
vnleave^ed: for even CHRIST our Passover, (...) sacrificed for us. Therefore
let us keep ^^e feast not with old leaven, neither with (...) leaven of
malice, and wickedness, ^^t with the unleavened bread of sincerity, ^^d truth:
1, Cor. 5, 6.

Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembrest that thy
^rother, has ought against thee: leave ^here thy gift before the Altar, and
go ^y way: first be reconciled to thy Brorher, ^^d then come, and offer thy
gift: Math. ^, 23. Psalm. 26, 6.

Ob. When we have done all we can (...) preparing our selves, yet shall we
fail ^f that which is written.

A. Therefore with H^zekiah, pray, say^ng; The good Lord pardon every one, that
^repareth his heart, to seek God; the Lord ^f his Fathers; though he be not
cleansed ac^ording to the purification of the Sanctu^ry. After which Prayer so
made, the LORD will hearken unto thee, and will heal thee: (2. Chro. 30.18.)
For when AARON was to minister; he was to put upon his forehead a plate of
pure gold; on which was engraven holiness to the LORD; that AARON might bear
the iniquity of the holy things; which the children of ISRAEL should hallow,
in all their holy gifts, which was always to be upon his forehead, that they
might be accepted before the LORD: (Exo. 28.26.) So was there also ordained, a
Goat for a sin offering, which was for the people; the blood whereof was to
be sprinkled upon the Mercy seat, and before the mercy seat; wherewith the
Priest was to make an atonement, for the holy place; because of the
uncleanness of the children of ISRAEL; and because of their transgressions, in
all their sins, and make an atonement for the Priests, and for all the people
of the Congregation: Leu. 16.15.16.33. verses.

Q. What if any man, that is apt for the Sacrament; shall wilfully neglect the
same?

A. The man that is clean, and is not (...) Journey; and forbeareth to keep
the ^^seover; even the same Soul, shall be (...) off from his people; because
he brought (...) the offering of the Lord, in his appoin^^d season: that man
shall bear his sin. ^umb. 9, 13. Exodus 4.24.

CHAP. XXXV. Of Discipline.
Ob, I Know some, who notwithstanding the frequent use of (...) these means of
Grace: have fallen ^y fearfully.

A. Therefore GOD has to the for^er means added Discipline: saying; ^hou
shall not hate thy Brother in thine ^eart: but thou shall in any wise rebuke ^y
Neighbor, and not suffer sin upon ^im: (Leuit. 19, 17.) For as Iron
sharpe^eth Iron: so a man sharpeneth the counte^ance of his friend: Prou. 27,
17.

Q How am I to deal with such one, that he may be reclaim^d?

A. If thy brother shall trespass against thee go, and tell him his fault,
between the^ and him alone: if he shall hear thee; tho^ have gained thy
brother. But if he will no^ hear thee; then take with thee, one, o^ two more;
that in the mouth of tw^ or three witnesses, every word may be^ established.
And if he shall neglect (...) hear them, tell it unto the Church: Math
18.15.16.

Q. What if he shall neglect to hear^ the Church?

A. I verily as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, a^
though I were present concerning suc^ a one, in the name of our Lord IESV^
CHRIST, when ye are gathered together etc. to deliver such a one unto Satan;
for the destruction of the flesh; that the spirit may be saved, in the day of
our Lord JESUS: (1 Cor. 5.3.5.) Verily I say unto you; That as whatsoever ye
shall loos^ on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven; so whatsoever ye shall bind
on earth, shall ^ bound in Heaven. (M^th. 18.18.) And ^ they whose sins ye
remit they are re^tted unto them: so whose sins so ever (...) retain, they
are retained: I^h. 20, 23. ^rou. 15.10.

Q. What if notwithstanding this Churches censure, he shall remain ob^^nate
in sinning; as was Himineus, and Alexander? 1 Timothy 1, 20.

A. Let him be unto thee, as an Heaven man, and a Publicane: (Math. 18 17.)
And call him reprobate silver; because ^e Lord has rejected him: (Ier. 6, 30.)
and withdraw your self from him, (2. ^^est. 3 6) and note him; and have no
^^mpany with him; that he may be a^^med: 2 Th^ss. 3, 14. Hos. 4, 17.

Q. But may I not still seek to re^laime him?

A. Give not that which is holy unto ^ogs; neither cast your pearls before
^^ine; least they trample them under their ^eet, and turn again, and rent
you: (Mat. ^, 6.) For be that reproves a scorner, gets to himself shame;
and he that rebukes a wicked man, gets himself a blot. Reprove not a
scorner, least he hate thee: (Prou. 9.7.) For correction is grievous, to him
that forsakes the way; neither will he go unto the wise: Prou. 15.10, 12.

Q. What if such a one, in the sense of this Curse, shall come to be truly
humbled for his sin?

A. Sufficient, unto such a man, is this punishment; so that contrariwise, ye
ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him; least perhaps, such a one, should
be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. Wherefore I beseech you, that you would
confirm your love toward him; least Satan should get an advantage over him:
for we are not ignorant of his devices: 2. Corinthians. 2, 6, 7. 11, 2, 2, 1, 2.
Prou. 27.9.

CHAP. XXXVI. Of the Continuance, with GODS blessing on the means of Grace.
Q. YOu have in some measure satisfied me, concerning the means of
perseverance in Grace; but have we any assurance that all these means of
Grace, shall be continued?

A. I will dwell among you: (Exodus 29.45.) And set my Sanctuary in the midst
of you, for evermore. My Tabernacle also shall be with you; yea, I will be
your GOD, and you shall be my people. And the Heathen shall know, that I the
LORD do sanctify Israel; when my Sanctuary shall be in the midst of you,
for evermore: Ezekiel. 37, 26. Leuit. 26.11, 12. Exodus 29, 42.

Ob. Though these means of Grace should be continued; yet may I grow weary,
in the use of them?

A. One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I w^ll seek after; that I may
dwell in the house of the Lord, all the days of my l^fe; to behold the beauty
of the Lord, and to inquire in his Temple: (Psalm. 27 4.) For I have loved the
habitation of his house, and the place where h^ honor dwells: P. 26 8.) L^k
w^s^ it shall come to pass; that from one new Moon, unto another and from one
S^bbath to another; shall all Flesh come to worship before me, s^^^^ ^he LORD:
Isa 66, 23.

Ob. Notwithstanding the continued use of these means; Grace it self may
decay?

A. In all places where GOD does record his Name: he will bless thee: Exodus
20, 24.) The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion: (Psalm. 128.5.) So that thou
shall flourish like a Palm tree, and like a Cedar in Libanon. Those that be
planted in the house of the LORD, shall flourish in the Courts of our GOD: they
shall bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat, and flourishing: to
show that the Lord is upright, he is my rock, and that there is no
unrighteousness in him: Psalm. 92, 12, 84, 7 65 4. 1, Cor. 15, 10. Math. 13,
^1, 32. Isa. 61, 11.

Q. What is required of us, to the and, that these means of Grace, may be thus
continued with success?

A. 1 Get David's appetite after them, ^aying; As the heart pants after the
wa^^r brooks; so does my heart pant, after ^hee, O GOD. My Soul thirsts for
God, for the living God; when shall I come, and appear before God? (Psalm. 42,
1.) My Soul longs; yea even faints for the Courts of the Lord: my heart,
and my flesh ^rieth out for the living God, etc. For a ^ay in his Courts is
better than a thousand; (...) had rather be a door keeper in the house ^f my
God: than to dwell in the tents of ^ickednesse: Psalm. 84, 1, 10. verses, 63, 1,
2, 137, 5, 6.

2 A delight in them. Rejoice with Ie^usalem, and be glad with her: all you
that love her; rejoice, for joy with her, ^ll you that mourn for her: that yo^
may suck, and be satisfied, with the breasts of her consolation: that you may
milk out, and be delighted, with the abundance of her glory: Isay, 66, 10.

3 Pray saying: O send out thy light, and thy truth; let them lead me: let
them bring me, unto thy holy Hill, and to thy Tabernacles: (Psalm. 43, 3.)
Send me help from thy Sanctuary: and strengthen me out of Zion. Remember all
my offerings; and accept my burnt Sacrifice: Psalm. 20, 2, 3. 134.3.

4 Keep thy foot when thou enterest into the house of God and be more near to
hear, than to give the Sacrifice of fools: (Eccl. 5, 1.) For which end, wash
thy hands in innocence, and so compass the Altars of God: Psalm. 26, 6.

5 When you come to worship the LORD, in the beauty of holiness: (Psalm. 96,
9.) Worship the Father in spirit, and in truth; for the Father seeks such, to
worship him. GOD is a spirit, and they that worship him; must worship him in
spirit, and truth, Job. 4.23.

6 Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; for the LORD blessed the Sabbath
day, and hallowed it: (Exodus 20.8, 11.) Wherefore if thou turn away thy foot
from the Sabbath from doing thy will, on my holy day: and call the Sabbath a
delight: and consecrate is, as glorious to the LORD; and shall honor him: not
doing thine own ways, not seeking thine own will, not speaking a vain word,
then shall thou delight in the LORD, and I will feed thee with the hreitage of
JACOB thy Father: For the mouth of the LORD has spoken it: (^^a. 58, 13.)
Blessed is the man that does this, and the Son of man which lays hold on
it, (Isa. 56, 2.) And embraces my Covenant: him will I bring unto my Holy
Mountain, and make him joyful in mine house of Prayer: Isa. 56, 6.7. Reu. ^,
10.

Q. If I should forbear my work on the Sabbath day, I should come to beggary,
at the last?

A. See; for that the LORD, has given you the Sabbath: therefore he gives
you on the sixth day, the bread of two days: therefore abide you every man in
his place: let no man go out of his place on the seventh day: Exodus 16, 29,
16, 5.

CHAP XXXVII Of Temporal Blessings, and in particular of long life.
Q. ALl these promises, you have mentioned: are of singular use unto the Soul:
but what provision shall we have for the body?

A. You shall inherit the earth: (Math. 5, 5.) For as CHRIST, so the world is
yours: 1, Cor. 3, 22.

Ob. What will the world profit us, if we be taken away by Death: and be
accounted among them that go down into the pit? Shall Gods loving kindness
be declared in the Grave? Or his faithfulness in destruction? Psalm. 88, 4,
11.

A. If thou forget not my Law, and thy heart keep my Commandments; length of
days, and long life shall they add unto thee: (Prou. 3 1.) And the years of
thy life shall be many: (Prou. 4.10.) And there shall old men, and old women
dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man, with his staff in his hand,
for very age. (Zach. 8, 4.) There shall be there no more an Infant of days:
nor an old man, that has not filled his days: for the Child shall dye an
hundred years old. For as the days of a Tree, are the days of my people:
(Isa. 65, 20, 22.) And with long life will I satisfy them: (Psalm. 91, 16.)
For they shall see their Childrens Children: (Psalm. 128, 6.) And come unto
their Grave in a full age, like as a shocke of Corn comes, in due season,
into the Barn: (Job. 5, 26.) As well as ABRAHAM: who dyed in a good old age,
an old man, and full of years: Genesis 25, 8. Psalm. 33, 18, 19. Ier. 45, 5, 39,
17. Genesis 15, 15, 35, 29 47, 28, 50. 23. Judge. 8, 32. 1, Chron. 29, 28, 2, 24,
15. 1, Sam. 25, 29.

Q. Is long Life a blessing of any worth?

A. The hoarie head is a Crown of Glory, if it be found in the way of
Righteousness: (Prou. 16, 31.) For as the beauty of young men is their
stregnth: so the glory of the aged, is their gray head: Prou. 20, 29.

Q. Is this promise, of long life, a blessing, common unto all?

A. No: for GOD shall bring the wicked down, into the pit of destruction: the
bloody and deceitful man shall not live ou^ half his days: (Psalm. 55.23.)
His confidence shall he rooted out, of his Tabernacle; and it shall bring him
to the King of terrors: (Job. 28, 14.) As the whirlewind passes; so is the
wicked no more: only the righteous is an everlasting foundation: (Prou.
10.25.) For as righteousness, tends unto life: so he that pursues evil
pursues it, to his own death: Prou. 11, 19, 10, 27. Psalm. 145, 20.

Ob. But do you not see many of the wicked; how their days are prolonged?

A. The woman that lives in pleasure, is dead while she lives: (1, Tim. 5, 6)
And men living ^ruitlessely, are, as trees, twice dead, and plucked up by the
roots: (Iud. 12) And therefore, though a sinner, do evil an hundred times,
and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them
that fear GOD, which fear before him: Ecc. 8, 12.

Q, What would you hence infer?

A. Therefore be thou not overmuch wicked; neither be thou foolish: for why
should thou dye, before thy time? (Eccl. 7, 17.) But set your hearts unto
all the words which I testify among you this day: that ye may command them
unto your Children; that they may observe and do all the words of this Law.
For it is no vain word, concerning you; but it is your life, and by this word
ye shall prolong your days, Deuteronomy. 32, 46, 47, 4, 40.6, 1 2 16.20.

Q. Why? does God for the sins of his own Children, shorten their days also?

A. Yea: for Moses; because he trespassed against the LORD, died in the Mount
Nebo, (Deuteronomy, 32, 50) For this cause also, many of the Corinthians were weak,
and sick, and fallen asleep: 1, Cor. 11, 30. 1 Samuel 2, 30, 31.

But yet when they are thus judged; they are chastened of the Lord: that they
should not be condemned with the world: (1, Cor. 11, 32.) And be taken away
from the evil to come: (Isa. 57, 1.) For Iosia was gathered to his Fathers in
peace; that his eyes might not see all the evil that was to come upon the
Nation of the Jews: 2, Chron. 34, 27.

CHAP. XXXVIII. Of preservation from Dangers.
Ob. THough my days upon earth should be many; yet the many dangers attending
them, will make my life without comfort?

A. Who so hearkeneth unto me, shall dwell safely; and shall be quiet, from
the fear of evil: (Pro. 1.33.) Remember I pray thee; who ever perished, being
innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? (Job. 4.7.) The humble person
shall deliver the Island of the innocents; and it is delivered, by the pureness
of thine hands. (Job. 22.30.) Whereby thou shall walk in thy way safely; and
thy foot shall not stumble: when thou lie down, thou shall not be afraid;
yea thou shall lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet: (Prou. 3, 23.) Surely
thou shall not be moved, for ever. Thou shall not be afraid of evil tidings;
thy heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.

Thy heart is established; thou shall not be afraid: (Psalm. 112, 6.) But shall
be as Mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abides for ever. As the
Mountains, are round about Jerusalem: so the Lord is round about his people;
from henceforth, even for ever: Psalm. 125.1.

Therefore hearken unto me, O house of Jacob; and all the remnants, of the
house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly; which are carried from
the womb; and even to your old age I am he, and even to your hoarie hairs I
will carry you, and so will deliver you: Isa. 46, 3. Psalm. 34, 4, 4, 8 27,
5.121, 3, 4, 8, 16, 8, 63, 8, 7, 10.11.3, 4. Zach. 10, 12. Acts, 2, 25. Prou.
18, 10. Deuteronomy. 33, 12. Isa. 4 5.

Ob. I know the rage of our enemies to be such; as they will leave, no means
unattempted, for our hurt.

A. The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him; but the Lord
will not leave him in his hands, nor condemn him, when he is judged: (Psalm.
37, 32.) He shall hide him in the secret of his presence, from the pride of
men; he shall keep them secretly in a pavilion, from the strife ^f tongues:
(Psalm. 31, 20.) As Birds ^y flying, so will the Lord of Hosts defend Jerusalem,
defending also he will deliver it; and passing over, he will preserve it:
(Isa. 31.5.) Whereby no man shall set ^n thee to hurt thee: (Acts, 18.10.)
Neither shall one hair of your head perish: (Luke 21, 18.) For the Lord will
deliver ^ou from every evil work; and will pre^erue you, to his heavenly
Kingdom: 2, Tim. 4, 18.

Therefore fear you not; stand still, and ^ee the Salvation which the Lord
will show ^^u: (Exodus 14, 13.) And be not afraid of their faces; for I am with
thee: to deli^er thee, says the Lord: (Ier. 1, 8.) Behold I have graven thee
upon the palms of my ^ands; thy walls are continually before ^e: Isa. 49, 16
54, 17 27, 2, 3. Exodus 14, 10, 23, 22. Ier. 1, 18, 15, 20. Psalm. 12, 8, 108.
^3. Acts. 9, 24, 25.9, 29, 30 31. Numb. 22 12, 18, 24, 1. 2, King. 6, 10. Neh.
4, 15. Deuteronomy. 20, 3. Isa. 31, 4.

Ob. My enemies do so much ouermatch me, as that before the combat, they do
promise unto themselves the conquest, saying; Let her be defiled, let our eye
look upon Zion: Micha, 4, 11. Exodus 15 9.

A. Who has despised the day of the small things? (Z^ch. 4, 10.) Let not him,
that girdeth on his harness, boast himself; as he that puts it off: 1
King. 20, 11.

We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is exceeding proud, his loftiness and
his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart; I know his
wrath, says the LORD: but it shall not be so: (Ierem. 48, 29.) But because
^hey rage against me; and their tumult, is come up into mine ears: therefore
will I put my hook into their nose, and my bridle into their lips; and I
will turn them back by the way, by which they come: Isa. 37, 29.29, 8.

For he powers contempt upon Princes; and causes them to wander in the
Wilderness, where there is no way; yet sets he the poor on high from
affliction, and makes him families, like a flock: (Psalm. 107.40.) He
frustrateth the tokens of liars, and makes Diviners mad; and turns wise men
backward, and makes their Knowledge foolishness: Isa. 44, 25.

Therefore be strong, and of good courage; fear not, nor be afraid of them:
for the Lord thy GOD, he it is that does go with thee: he will not fail thee,
nor forsake thee: (Deuteronomy. 31, 6.) With them is an arm of flesh; but with you is
the Lord your GOD, to help, and to fight your battles: 2 Chronicles. 32 8.20, 15.
Ios. 1, 5. Isa. 50, 1.44 25, 18, 7.9, 15, 16. 2 Samuel 16, 23. 17, 14. Ierem. 1,
18.15, 26. Job, 41, 34. 2 King. 19 32. Zach. 12, 7.

Examples. 1 Samuel 18, 11.1.21, 1.1.25, 10.1.23, 14.1.23, 25.14, 44. 2 Samuel 21,
16.2.20, 22. Acts. 14, 5.14, 19, 20. 26, 21. Psalm. 105, 12.

Ob. Though GOD should preserve us once, and again, from our Enemies; yet if
they be suffered to stand in their strength; ours is the fear, and theirs is
the hope, of their prevailing at the last.

A. But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his
council; for he shall gather them as the sheaues into his floor. (Micha.
4.12.) Behold they shall gather together; but not by me, whosoever shall gather
together against thee, shall fall for thy sake. (Isa. 54.15.) Now will I arise,
says the LORD; now will I be exalted; Now will I lift up my self; they shall
conceive chafe, they shall bring forth stubble; their breath as fire shall
devour them, And the people shall be as the burning of l^^e as thorns cut up
shall they be burnt in the fire: (Isa. 33.10.) And as ashes under the soles of
your feet in the day that I shall do this, says the Lord of hosts: Mal. 4.3.

Thus when SIHON gathered all his people together, to fight against Israel;
Israel smote him, with the edge of the sword: (Number. 21.23.) Also OG the King ^f
Bashan, with his sons, and all his people; until none was left alive: (Numb.
21.35.) So shall ye also know, that I am the LORD your GOD, dwelling in Zion,
my holy Mountain; then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no Stranger
pass through her any more: Joel, 3, 17. Isa 41.10.41.15.16. Deuteronomy. 9, 3, 7.22,
3.21.22, 33, 17. Ios. 21 44. Psalm. 89, 23. Isa. 63, 3.26, 1.

Examples: Numb. 31, 7, 8. 1 Samuel 19, 8, 1, 27, 8, 1, 30, 16. 2 Samuel 3, 1, 2,
5, 25. 8, 1, 2, 6, 13, 14.2, 12, 26. Exodus 17, 13. 14, 30. 2, Chron. 32, 21. 2
King. 19, 35. Ios. 10, 40.12 20.

Ob. But our Enemies are many, and mighty; and therefore not to be subdued?

A. GOD shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in
their stead: (Job, 34 24.) He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength; who
has hardened him self against him, and prospered? Which removes the
Mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger; which
shakes the Earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble, etc.
Behold he takes away: who can hinder him? Who will say unto him, what do
thou? If GOD will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under
him: (Job. 9.4 12.) But your Enemies are men, and not GOD: their Horses flesh,
and not spirit: when the Lord shall stretch out his hand; both he that helps
shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall down; and they shall all fail
together: (Isa. 31.^3.) For there is none like unto the GOD of Iesur^^: Who
rides upon the Heavens, in thy help, and in his Excellency on the sky. The
Eternal GOD is thy refuge: and underneath are the everlasting arms; and he
shall thrust out the Enemy from before thee, and shall say, Destroy them:
(Deuteronomy. ^3.26.) Whereby thou shall know, that the Lord is greater than all Gods:
for in the thing, wherein they deal proudly, he is above them: ((...). 18,
11.) For the Chariots of the Lord are twenty thousand, even thousands of
Angels: the Lord is among you, as in Sinai; in the holy place: (Psalm. 68, 17)
And he shall bring them down that dwell on high: the lofty City, he lays
it low, he brings it low even to the ground; he brings it even to the dust.
The foot shall tread it down; even the feet of the poor, and the steps of
the ^eedie: Isa. 26, 5.

For a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakins; the LORD destroyed
before Israel: (D^ut. 2, 21.) Of whom it was said; who can stand before the
Children of ANA^? (Deuteronomy. 9, 2) Were not the Aethiopians also, and the Lubim^ an
huge Host; with very many Chariots, and Horsemen? yet because AS^ did rely on
the Lord, he delivered them into his hand: 2 Chronicles. 16 8.

If therefore thou shall say, in thine heart; These Nations are more then I: how
can I dispossess them? Thou shall not be afraid of them; but shall well
remember what the Lord thy GOD did unto PHARAOH, and unto all Egypt; the great
temptations, which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the
mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD brought thee out. So
shall the Lord thy God do unto all the people, of whom thou art afraid, etc.

Ob. You tell me of great things, the Lord will do for his people; but I see
no means to effect the same?

A. He will have Mercy upon the house of Judah; and will save them by the Lord
their GOD: and will not save them by Bow, nor by Sword, nor by Battle, by
Horses, nor by Horsemen: (Hos. 1, 7,) But by a sling, and a stone, (1, Sam,
17.49) With trumpets of Rams-hornes, (Ios. 6, 20) With an Ox goade, (Judge. 3,
31.) By I^el Hebeus wife: (Judge. 5.27) By Ehud, a man lame on his right hand:
(Judge. 3.15.) By Gedeon, whose family was least in his Fathers House: (6, 15.)
And that when there was no Smith in Israel: 1, Sam. 13.19.

One man shall chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight: (Deuteronomy.
32.30. Ios. 23.10.) As with Jonathan, and his armor bearer, (1, Sam. 14.13.)
And in the want of other means; one enemy, shall help to destroy another: 2,
Chron, 20.22. Judge. 7.22.2, Chron. 20.17. 2, King. 19.6.

For he will send his fear before thee: (Exodus 23, 27.) And he will put the
dread of thee, and the fear of thee upon the Nations, that are under the whole
Heaven: who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble and be in anguish,
because of thee: (Deutrinom. 2, 25.) They shall lick the dust like a Serpent;
they shall move out of their holes like Worms of the Earth; they shall be
afraid of the LORD our GOD; and shall fear because of thee: Micha, 7, 17. As
well as SAVL, who was afraid of DAVID; because the Lord was with him: (1 Samuel
18, 12.) So the hearts of all the Kings of the Amorites fainted: (Ios. 5.1.)
And were in great fear; for GOD is in the generation of the Righteous: Psalm.
14 5. Isa. 19, 17.33.14. Zach. 12.1. Deuteronomy. 11.25.28 10. Ios. 29. Number. 22, 3.
Psalm. 53 5. Genesis 35.5.

Q. Seeing the promises, of Preservation from Enemies are such, and so many;
what may this teach us?

A. Therefore say ye not a Confederacy, to all them, to whom all these people
shall say a confederacy; neither fear you their fear; nor be afraid,
Sanctify the LORD of Hosts himself: and let him be your fear, and let him
be your dread: ((...). 8.12) And strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm
the feeble knees. Say to them that are of fearful heart: Be strong: fear
not: Isa. 35, 3.^1.13. Deuteronomy. 20, 3. Number. 14 9. 2 King. 19, 6. ^oh ^4 1.

2 Trust ye in the LORD for ever; because in the Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting
strength: (Isa. 26.4.) It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put
confidence in Man; it is bettter to trust in the LORD, than to put confidence
in Princes: (Psalm. 118, 8.) O Israel trust thou in the LORD: he is their
help, and their shield. O house of AARON, trust in the Lord; he is their
help and their shield: ye that fear the Lord trust in the Lord; he is their
help and their shield: Psalm. 115 9.

3 Ar^se, and thresh O Daughter of Zion, for I will make thine horn Iron, and
I will make thy hooves Brass: and thou shall beat in pieces many people,
says the LORD: (Micha, 4, 13.) Be of good courage, and let us play the Men;
for our people, and for the Cities of our GOD; and let the Lord do that which
seems him good: 2 Samuel 10, 12.

CHAP. XXXIX. Of Deliverance, out of the foresaid evils.
Ob. AH, my LORD; if the Lord be thus, with us: Why then is all this come upon
us? And where be all his Miracles, which our Fathers told us of, and said; Did
not the LORD deliver us from the Spanish Invasion, in the year, LXXXVIII? But
now the LORD has forsaken the Palatinate, and delivered it into the hand of
the SPANIARD? Judge. 6, 13. 1, Sam. 4, 13. Deuteronomie, 28, 25. Nahum, 3, 11.

A. ISRAEL has sinned, and they have also transgressed my Covenant, which I
commanded them; for they have taken even of the accursed thing, etc. Therefore
they could not stand before their enemies: (Ios. 7, 11.) And because they
served not the LORD their GOD, with ioyfulnesse, and with gladness of heart,
for the abundance of all things; therefore do they serve their enemies, which
the Lord has sent against them, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,
and in the want of all things: Deuteronomy. 28.47.

Who then gave JACOB for a spoil, and Israel to the Robbers? Did not the Lord;
he, against whom they have sinned? For they would not walk in his ways,
neither were they obedient unto his law. Therefore he has powered upon them the
fury of his anger, and the strength of Battle, and it has set them on fire,
round about; yet they know not, and it burdeneth them, and they lay it not to
heart: (Isa. 42, 24.) Therefore the Emperor before, and the Spaniard behind,
have devoured ISREAL with open mouth; and yet for all this, his anger, is not
turned away: but his hand is stretched out still. For the people turns not to
him that smites them: Neither do they seek the LORD of Hosts: Isa. 9, 12,
65.12. 10, ^, 4 66, 24. Leuit. 26, 17, 25, 26, 32. 32, 26.36. Ier. 7.30 19.9.2,
King. 21, 1. Amos, 6, 8.1, Sam. 28, 19. Lam. 4, 11.

Thus when Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, etc. The
anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and he delivered them up into the
hands of the spoylers, that spoiled them, etc. so that they could not any
longer stand before their Enemies* (Judge. 2, 11.) Likewise the army of the
Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great
Host into their hand. Because they had forsaken the Lord GOD of their Fathers:
2 Chronicles. 24, 23. Judge. 3, 7.8.3.12.4.1.2.6.1.13.1.16.20. 1 Chronicles. 10 13.2.16.7.
1 Samuel 4.2.10. 1 King. 14.25.2.13.1. Exodus 32.25.

Q. But have the sins of the Palatinate been so great, as that there is ^o
way left, whereby they may escape the Enemies hands?

A. If yet they shall confess their iniquity the iniquities of their Fathers;
with their trespass, which they trespassed against me; and that also they have
walked contrary unto me, and that I also have walked contrary unto them, etc.
If now their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they do accept of the
punishment of their iniquity; then will I remember my Covenant with them and
also my Covenant with Abraham, will I remember; and I will remember the Land:
(^euit. 26.40.) And when they shall walk after m^, I will roar like a Lion*
when I shall roar: then the Spaniard and Emperor shall tremble. They shall
tremble, as a B^rd out of Egypt, and as a Dove out of the Land of Assyria, and
I will place them in their Houses, says the LORD: (Hos. 11, 10.) Up therefore,
and let them sanctify themselves against the morrow: Ios. 7, 13. Psalm. 81, 13.

Which that you may do, remember then the King of Egypt came up against
Jerusalem; because they had transgressed against the LORD, etc. Therefore he
left them in the hand of Shishak. Whereupon, the Princes of Israel, and the
Kings humbling themselves, saying the LORD is righteous. And when the LORD saw,
that they humbled themselves: the Word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying;
they have humbled themselves; therefore will I not destroy them, but I will
grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be powered out upon
JERUSALEM; by the hand of SHISHAK: (2, Chron. 12, 2.) Yea many times did he
deliver them, but they provoked him by their Council, and were brought low for
their iniquities; nevertheless he regarded their affliction when he heard
their cry. And he remembered for them his Covenant, and repented according to
the multitude of his Mercies: Psalm. 106.43,

Thus also will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you: and
therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you; for the LORD is
a GOD of judgment: (Isa. 30.18.) For he will judge his people, and he will
repent himself, concerning his Servants: Psalm, 135.14.2, Chron. 15, 3, 33, 9,
and 32, 25.1, King. 21, 27. Iona. 3, 10.4.2. Hos. 10, 12. Deuteronomy. 4, 29. Judge. 6,
11, 33 1, Sam. 12.7.

Q. What use are we, and they of the Palatinate to make hereof?

A. Therefore fear not: for though ye have done all this wickedness: yet
depart not from following the Lord; but serve the Lord with all your heart,
neither turn ye back; for that should be after vain things, which cannot
profit you, nor deliver you; for they are but vanity: (1, Sam. 12, 20.) And if
ye do turn unto the Lord, with all your hearts; then put away the strange
Gods: and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your heart unto the Lord, and
serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of your Enemies: 1,
Sam. 7, 3. Hosea, 13, 1. Lament. 3, 40 41. Deuteronomy. 13, 17. Jeremiah, 3, 12.2,
Chronicles, 30, 8.

2 Sanctify you a fast call ye a solemn assembly, gather together the
Elders, and all the Inhab tants of the Land into the house of the Lord your
GOD, and cry unto the Lord: (Io^l. 1, 14.) And say; take away all iniquity,
and receive us graciously: so will we r^nder the Calves of our lips. Ashur
shall not save us, we will not ride upon Horses: Neither will we say any more
to the work of our hands; ye are our GODS: For in thee, the Fatherless find
mercy. Hos. 13, 1.

O Lo^d our God other Lords, besides thee have ruled over us: but we will
remember thee only, and thy Name: Isay, 26, 13.

Rise up Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate thee
flee before thee, and return O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel. (Numb.
10, 35.) Or if thou will n^eds affl^ct us: let us now fall into the hand of the
Lord; for his Mercies are great, and let us not fall into the hands of men: (2,
Sam. 24.14.) Whose tender mercies are cruel: Prou. 12 10. Neh. 1, 5 9.32 2
King. 9, ^5. Psalm. 10, 35, 8, 1, 2. 1, Kings, 8, ^3.

Q. When GOD has delivered us ^om our enemies, what are we then (...) do?

A. Awake, awake Deborah: awake, ^^ake; utter a song: arise Barak thou Son
(Ab^^oam. I^dg. 5, 12.) Come and be^^ld, the works of the LORD, what
deso^tions, he has made in the earth? He ^aketh the Wars to cease unto the
ends of ^he earth: he breaks the bow, and cut^th the spear in sunder: he
burns the ^hariots in the fire. (Psalm. 46, 8.) Sing unto the LORD, for he
has triumphed ^^^riously: the Horse and the rider, has he ^^rowne into the
Sea. The LORD is my ^^rength, and my Song, and he is become my Salvation: he
is my GOD, and I will ^repare him an habitation: my Fathers GOD, and I will
exalt him. The LORD (...) a man of War; the LORD of Hosts this name: (Exodus
15.1.) Who is like unto thee O LORD, amongst the Gods? who is like thee;
glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders: (Exodus 15, 11.) Who
would not fear thee, O King of Nations? For to thee does it appertain: for as
much as among all the wise men of the Nations, and in all their Kingdoms,
there is none like unto thee: (Ier. 10, 7. Psalm. 35, 9.) Thou bring the
Councels of the Heathen to naught, thou make the devises of the people of
none effect: Psalm. 33, 10.9, 6. Genesis 14, 20. Psalm. 64, 6.66.1, ^3, 2, 13.5.18,
35, 30, 1, 31, 7, 76.1, 98 1, 124, 1, 18, 36, 18.46, 28.7, 9, 1.144, 1.140, 7.
Isa. 25, 1, 2.52, 9. Psalm, 74, 12, 47, 1. 1, Sam. 2, 1. Psalm. 31, 21.44, 8, 48,
1, 3, 31, 7, 92 9.

Ob. Were it to be granted, that the hand of man, may be either too short to
reach us: or too weak to hold us under: yet who can stand when God himself,
as with an overflowing flood, shall come to judge terribly the earth? Numb. 24,
23. Isay. 64.3, 2, 19. Ierem. 47, 2.

A. The Lord knows how to deliver ^he godly, out of temptations; and to
re^oue the unjust, unto the day of Judgment, (...) be punished: (2, Pet. 2,
^.) For behold ^be name of the Lord comes from far; ^is face is burning,
and the burden thereof (...) heavy; his lips are full of indignation, ^^d his
tongue is a devouring fire. And his ^^irit is a river, that overfloweth up to
the ^ucke: it divides a sunder to fan the Nations, with the fan, of
vanity. But ^here shall be a song unto you: as in the ^ight; when a solemn
feast is kept; and ^ladnesse of heart, as he that comes with a pipe, to go
unto the Mount of ^he LORD, to the mighty one of ISRAEL, (Isa. 30.27.) The LORD
^^all roar out of ZION, and utter his voice from JERUSALEM; and the Hea^^ns
and the Earth shall shake, but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and
the strength of the children of Is^^el: (Joel. 3, 16.) When men are cast ^^wne;
then they shall say there is a lifting (...); and he shall save the humble
person: Job. 22.29. Ezekiel. 9, 4, 6. Revel. 9, 4, 7, 2, 3. Ez^k. 14 14. Mal. 4,
Psalm. 91, 3. Isa. 6, 12, 13, 65, 8.1.9.17, 5. Joel. 2, 32. Amos, 3, 12 9, 8, 4
11.

For your eyes have seen, what the LORD did because of Ba^l-poor: for all the
men that followed Ba^l-peor, the Lord thy God has destroyed them from among
you: but ye that did cleave unto the Lord your GOD, are all alive: every one
of you, until this day: Deuteronomy. 4, 3. Exodus 8, 22, 9.6.9
5.^0.23.11.7.12.23.14.27. Heb. 11.31. Ios. 6, 17 6.24. Numb. 14, 12. 2, King.
22.15. Ier. 40.4. Genesis 19.16.

Q. What may this teach us?

A. 1. Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the Earth, which have wrought his
Judgments; seek Righeeousnesse, seek meekness: it may be, ye shall be
h^d in the day of the Lor^s anger: (Z^ph. 2, 3.) For the eyes of the Lord run
too and fro, throughout the whole earth: to show himself strong, in the
behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him: 2, Chron. 16, 9.

2 Be not afraid of sudden fear; nor if the dissolation, of the wicked when
it ^^mmeth, for the LORD shall be thy confidence, and keep thy feet from
being ta^en: (Prou. 3.25.) GOD is our refuge, and strength; a very present
help in ^rouble. Therefore do not fear, though the Earth be remooved, and
though the Mountains be carried, into the midst of the Sea. Though the
waters thereof ^^are, and be troubled; though the Moun^^ines shake, with the
swellings thereof. There is a river; the streams whereof, shall make glad, the
City of GOD: the holy place, of the Tabernacle of the most ^igh. GOD is in the
midst of her; she ^^all not be moved: God shall help her; and that right
early. The Heathen ^^aged: the Kingdoms were moved: he ^^terd his voice: the
Earth melted. The LORD of Hosts is with us; the GOD ^f JACOB, is our refuge:
Psalm. 46, 1.

3 Come my people, enter thou into thy hambers, and shut thy doors about thee;
^^de thy self, as it were, for a little moment, until the indignation be
overpast. For behold the Lord comes out of his place, to punish the
Inhabitants of the Earth, for their iniquity; the Earth also shall disclose
her blood, and shall no more cover her slain: (Isa. 26, 20.) So that except,
the LORD of hosts, had left us, a very small remnant; we should have been,
as SODOM; and we should have been, like unto GOMORRAH: Isa. 1, 9.

CHAP XL. Of outward Prosperity.
Ob. NOw am I well apayed in regard of evils feared; but if a man live many
years; and the days of his years, be multiplied: and yet his Soul be not
satisfied, with good things; I say unto you, That an untimely fruit, is better
than he: Eccles. 6.3.

A. If you serve, and obey him; you shall spend your days in prosperity, and
your years in pleasures: (Job, 36, 11.) Thou shall decree a thing, and it
shall be established unto thee; and the light shall shine upon thy way. (Job.
22, 28) And you shall rejoice in all that you put your ^and unto: and your
households: wherein the Lord your GOD has blessed you: (Deuteronomy. 12, 7.) You shall
be to me a name of Joy; a praise, and an honor, before all the Nations of the
earth; which shall bear of all the good that I do unto you; and they shall
fear, and tremble, for all the goodness, and for all the prosperity, that I
procure unto you: (Ier. 33, 9.) And they shall call you Blessed; for you shall
be a delight some Land: says the Lord of hosts: (Mal. 3.12.) Who shall
greatly bless thee in the Land, which he gives thee, for an Inheritance, to
possess it. Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice, of the LORD thy
GOD; to observe; to do all these Commandments, which I command thee this day:
Deuteronomy. 15.4.28.2.8. Psalm. 128.2.1.1. 2 Chronicles. 31, 21. Job, 11, 17. Hosea, 14, 5.

For HEZEKIAH cleaving unto the Lord, and departing not from following him; but
keeping his Commandments, which the Lord commanded MOSES; the Lord was with
him, and he prospered, whethersoever he went forth: (2. King. 18.6.) The Lord
was ^^^o with Iehosaphat; because he walked in the first ways of his Father
D^vi^, and sought not unto Baal^m, but sought the Lord GOD of his Fathers; and
walked in his Commandement^, and not after the doings of Israel. Therefore the
Lord stablished the Kingdom in his hands. And all Judah brought to Iehosapha^
presents; and he had riches, and honor in abundance: 2, Chron. 17.3. Numb.
24.3. Deuteronomy. 2, 7, 40. Psalm. 23, 5.6. 1 King. 8 66. Genesis 39, 23.

Q. What use are we to make of this?

A. Pray, saying; Save now, I beseech thee O Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee send
now prosperity: (Psalm. 118, 25.) Let the beauty of the Lord our GOD be upon
us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea the work of our
hands, establish thou it: Psalm. 90.17.

2 Be thou strong and very courageous; that thou may observe, to do
according to all the Law, which MOSES my servant commanded thee: turn not from
it, to the right hand, or to the left; that thou may prosper, whethersoever
thou go. This book of the Law, shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou
shall meditate therein, day and night; that thou may observe to do,
according to all that is written therein; for then shall thou make thy ways
prosperous, and then thou shall have good success: Ios. 1, 7.

Ob. Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee; yet let me talk with
thee of thy Judgments? Wherefore does the way of the Wicked, prosper?
Wherefore are all they happy, that deal very treacherously? Thou have planted
them; yea, they have taken root: they grow: yea, they bring forth fruit:
(Ier. 12, 1.) Behold these are the ungodly; who prosper in the World; they
increase in riches: Psalm. 73.12, etc. Ierem. 5, 27. Job, 12, 6.

A. My righteousness is like the great Mountains, and my Judgments are as a
great deep: (Psalm. 36.6.) Yet enter thou into the Sanctuary of GOD; for then
shall thou understand: Psalm. 73, 16.

1 That the wicked do rejoice, in deed: but not from the heart: (2. Cor.
5.12.) For in their laughter their heart is sorrowful: (Pro. 14.13.) Of such
laughter I said, thou art mad; and of such mirth, what does it? Eccles, 2.2,

2. They have their portion in this life: (Psalm. 17, 14.) As ESAV the fatness
of the Earth: (Genesis 27 39,) And do prosper, till the indignation accomplished.
D^n. 11.36.

3 Better is the end of a thing, than the beginning: (Eccl. 7.8.) For does not
their execellencie, which is in them go away? (Job. 4.21.) How often is the
candle of the wicked put out? And how often comes their destruction upon them?
(Job, 21.17.) Yea the light of the wicked shall be put out; and the spark of
his fire, shall not shine. The light, shall be dark in his Tabernacle, and his
candle shall be put ^^t with him. The steps of his strength shall be straightened,
and his own counsel shall cast him down. (Job. 18.5.) Yea all the horns of
the wicked shall be broken. Psalm. 75.10. Eccl. 5, 15. Pro. 24, 19 20,

4 Know thou not this of old: since Man was placed upon earth; that the
triumphing of the wicked is short; and the joy of the hypocrite but for a
moment? (Job. 20.4.) I have seen the foolish taking root; but suddenly I
cursed his habitation. (Job. 5, 3,) How are they brought into desolation as in
a moment? As a dream, when one awaketh; so shall GOD despise their image:
Psalm. 73.19.20.

5 There is hope of a tree if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, etc.
but the wicked man dies and where is he? (Job. 14.7.) He shall return no more
to his house, neither shall his place know him any more:

A. A faithful man abounds with blessings: (Prou. 28, 20.) Even all these
blessings, shall come upon him, and overtake him: Deuteronomy. 28, 2.

1. He shall inherit the Land, and dwell there in, for ever: (Psalm. 37, 29.) And
shall possess his possessions: (Obad. 17.) He shall be no more plucked out of
his Land, which I have given him, says the LORD; Amos 9, 15. Leuit.
20.24.25.18. Deuteronomy. 11, 24.2, Sam. 7, 10. Joel 3, 20. Ier. 12, 16. Numb. 14, 8,
24. Josh. 24, 13.14, 9, 14.14.

But the sinners, shall be destroyed, out of the Land: (Isa. 13.9.) And be
brought unto a Nation; which neither they, nor their Fathers have known:
(Deuteronomy. 28, 36.) And the LORD shall scatter them, among all people, from the one
end of the Earth, even unto the other: (Deuteronomy. 28, 64.) For he will send unto
them wanderers, that shall cause them to wander; and shall empty their vessels,
and break their bottels: (Ier. 48, 12.) And they shall be among the Gentiles,
as a vessel, wherein there is no ^leasure: (Hos. 8, 8.) Then shall the Land
enjoy her Sabbaths, as long as it ly^th desolate, and they be in their Enemies
Land; even then shall all the land rest, and enjoy her Sabbaths. As long as it
lies desolate, it shall rest; because it did not rest in their Sabbaths, when
they dwelt upon it: (Leuit. 26, 34.) And it shall come to pass; when ye shall
say; wherefore does the LORD, our GOD, all these things unto us? Then shall
thou answer them: like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange GODS, in
your Land, so shall ye serve strangers, in a Land that is not yours: Ier. 5,
19.24.8.23.7.2, King. 24 9.2, 17.6.7.2.18 9, 10.12. verses 114.15.2, Chron. ^6,
20. Numb. 14, 22. 30, 35.37, 20.24. Ezekiel. 26, 13, 28, 25, 39, 25. M^l. 14, 5.
Leuit. 26, 39, 20, 22.18.24. Ier. 6, 8. I^r. 9, 16.

Q. Which is the second outward blessing?

A. Multitude of people: for who could count the dust of JACOB; and the number,
of the fourth part of ISRAEL? (Numb. 23, 10.) With whom the Land of Egypt was
filled: (Exodus 1, 7.) For they became, as the Stars in Heaven, for multitude:
(D^utr. 10, 22.) And were more and mightyer than their Enemies: Exodus 1, 9.12,
13.2, Sam. 24, 9. Isay. 48, 18.

But if thou will not observe, to do all the words of this Law, etc. Ye shall
be left few in number: (Deutron. 28.58.62.) And your high ways shall be
desolate: Leuit. 26.22. Isa, 13.20.

Hear therefore O ISRAEL; and observe to do it; that it might be well with
thee, and that ye may increase mightily; as the LORD GOD of your Fathers has
promised thee: Deuteronomy. 6, 3.

CHAP. XLII. Of good Government.
Q. HOw shall so much people be governed?

A. It shall come to pass if ye diligently hearken unto me, (says the LORD,
etc.) Then shall there enter, unto the gates of this City, Kings and Prin^es;
sitting upon the Throne of DAVID; riding in Charets, and Horses; they, and
their Princes: (Ier. 17, 24.) And your eyes shall see the King in his beauty:
(Isay, 33, 17.) And your Nobles shall be of your selves; and your Governors
shall proceed from the midst of you: Ier. 30, 21, 22, 4. 1, Kings, 2.45.

But if you will not hearken unto the LORD your GOD; ye shall have cause to
say; we have no King: because we fear not the LORD; And what shall a King
do to us? (Hos. 10.3.) For from us, GOD takes away a King, in his wrath: Hos.
13, 12. Isa. 3, 2.

Q. What is the hurt which comes to a people, by having no King, or Ruler, to
govern them?

A. As when there was no King in ISRAEL: every one, did that which seemed good,
in his own eyes: (Judge. 17.6.) So there shall be, as with the people, so with
the Priest; as with the Servant, so with the Master: as with the Maid, so with
the Mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller: as with the Lender: so
with the Borrower: as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury:
Isa. 24, 2. Judge. 18, 18.19.22.

Q. What benefit, does the Church receive, by the government of Kings?

A. When the Earth, and all the Inhabitants thereof are dissolved; he will
bear up the Pillars of it: (Psalm. 75. 3.) He is the light of ISRAEL: (2, Sam.
21, 17.) And the beauty thereof: (2, Sam. 1, 19, 23, 4.) The very breath of
your nosthrils, and under his shadow, you shall be preserved: (Lam. 4, 20.) And
a man shall be, as a hi^ing place from the Wind, and a covert from the
Tempest: as Rivers of water in a dry place: and the shadow of a great Rock, in
a weary land: (Isa. 32, 2.) Kings shall be your nursing Fathers, and Queens
your nursing Mothers: Isa. 49.23.

For the Jews, and all ISRAEL, dwelt safely: every Man, under his Vine, and
under his Fig Tree, from DAN, even to BEER-SHEBA; all the days of SOLOMON:
(1, King. 4, 25.) And GOD saved ISRAEL, by the hand of JEROBOAM: 2, King. 14,
27. 2. Sam 8, 3.

Q. By what means, does a King become, so blessed an instrument, of our good?

A. Because by GOD it is that Kings Reign; (Prou. 8, 15.) He shall give him
another heart: (1, Sam. 10.9.) And he shall be turned into another man: (1,
Sam. 10, 6.) And the wisdom of God, shall be in him, to do Judgment: 1,
King. 3, 28.

For it shall be when he sits upon the Throne of his Kingdom that he shall
write him a Copy of the Law in a book. And it shall be with him, and he shall
read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn, to fear the Lord
his God, to keep all the words of this Law, and the Statutes to do them:
(Deuteronomy. 17.18.) Whereby a divine sentence shall be in the lips of the King, and
his mouth transgresses not in Judgment: (Prou. 16, 10.) But he shall reign
in Justice, and your Princes shall rule in Judgment: Isa. 32, 1.

For David reigned over all Israel, and executed Judgment, and Justice among
all his people: (1. Chron. 18, 14. And judged uprightly: (Psalm. 75 2.) And that
was because the Lord loved Israel: 1, King. 10.9. 2, Chron. 2, 11.

For as when the Righteous are in authority the people rejoice, so when the
wicked bear rule, the people mourn: Prou. 29, 2.4. Prou. 28, 15, 16.29, 12.
Eccl. 10 17. 1, Sam. 28, 3, 2, 5.12. 1, Kings, 15.1^, 2, 10, 28, 2, 14, 5, 6,
2, 23, 3. 2, Chron. 14, 3, 29, 3, 34, 3, 2, 36.22.

2 Because the work will be too heavy for one man; neither is he able to
perform it alone: (Exodus 18, 18.) He, after the wisdom of his GOD, that is
in his heart, shall set up Magistrates, and Judges; which may judge all the
people: (Ezra, 7, 25.) And place such over them, ^s are able men; such as fear
GOD; ^en of truth, hating covetousness; to be ^ulers of thousands, and Rulers
of hundreds, and rulers of fifties, and rulers of ^^nnes; to judge the people
at all seasons: Exodus 18, 21.

And the King shall charge them, say^^g; Thus shall ye do, in the fear of
^he LORD faithfully and with a perfect ^eart. So that whatsoever cause shall
come to you of your Brethren, that dwell in their Cities, etc. You shall warn
them, that they trespass not against the LORD: (2, Chron. 19, 9.) Ye shall
not wrest the Judgment of the poor in his ^ouse: (Exodus 23, 6.) But ye shall
justify the Righteous, and condemn the wicked: (Deuteronomy. 25.1.) Which that ye
may the better do, ye shall take no gift; for the gift blinds the wise,
and perverteth the words of the Righteous: (Exodus 23.8.) Neither shall you
respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: (Leuit.
15.19.) You shall take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for men, but for
the LORD; who is with you in the Judgment. Wherefore now let the fear of the
Lord be upon you. Take heed and do it, for there is no iniquity with the
Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts: (2, Chron. 19.6.)
Thus shall you judge the people, at all seasons: and it shall be, that every
great matter you shall bring unto me; but every small matter, you shall judge:
so shall it be easier for me, when you shall bear the burden with me: Exodus
18.22. 1, Sam. 7, 15, 16. Deuteronomy. 16, 19, 1, 17. Ier. 22 3.21, 12. Amos, 5, 15.
Micha, 3.1. Psalm. 82, 2. Prou. 18.5. 2, Sam. 23, 3.

Q. What good shall come to us by these substitutes in Government?

A. As the Mountains shall bring peace to the people; so the little Hills by
righteousness: (Psalm. 72, 3.) For God led his people like a flock, by the hand
of Moses, and Aaron: (Psalm. 77.20.) And Mordecay sought the wealth of his
people, and spoke peace unto all his seed: Esth. 10.3. Psalm. 72.4. Job. 29.12.
2, King. 8, 6.

Q. What may the promise of good Rulers teach us?

A. To pray, saying; Let the Lord, the GOD of the spirits of all flesh set a
man ^ver the Congregation, which may go out before them, and which may go in
before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that
the. Congregation of the LORD ^^e not as Sheep, which have no Shepherd:
(Numb. 27.16.) But that we may lead a quiet, and peaceable life, in all
Godliness, and Honesty: 1, Tim. 2, 2.

Q. When we have a King, and others sent of him to govern us, what is
required of us?

A. 1 Fear the LORD in truth and with all your hearts; because if you shall
do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your King: 1, Sam. 12.24.25.

2 I exhort that supplications and prayers, with giving of thanks be made for
Kings, and for all that are in authority: (1, Tim. 2, 1.) Wherein because the
Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord; as the Rivers of water, he turns it
whethersoever he will: (Prou. 21, 1.) Pray, give the King thy Judgments O Lord,
and thy Righteousness unto the Kings Son: that so he may judge the people with
righteousness and the poor with Judgment: (Psalm. 72, 1.) And as thou have set
thy Servant over thy people, give him an understanding heart, to judge thy
people, that he^ may discern between good, and bad; for who is able to judge
this so great a people? (1, King. 3, 9) And take away the wicked from the King,
that his Throne may be established in righteousness: Prou. 25 4.

Bless Lord his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite thorough
the loins of them that rise against him and of them that hate him, that they
rise not again: (Deuteronomy. 33, 11.) Let him abide for ever before thee. O prepare
mercy, and truth which may preserve him; so will I sing praises unto thy name
for ever: (Psalm, 61, 7.) And the King also shall joy in thy strength, O LORD,
and in thy salvation, how greatly shall he rejoice? Psalm. 21.1, 80, 17. 1,
King. 8, 25.

3 Honor the King: (1, Pet. 2, 17.) A^ did ARAVNAN who when he saw the King
coming toward him; he went out, and bowed himself before the King, on his
face, on the ground: (2, Sam. 24.20) And be not hasty to go out of his sight:
Eccl. 8, 3.

4 Let them be had in double honor: (1, Tim. 5.17.) For, for this cause pay
you tribute also; for they are GODS Ministers, attending continually upon this
very thing. Render therefore to all their dues; tribute, to whom tribute is
due, custom to whom Custom: (Ro^, 13.6.) Even unto CAESAR, the things that
are CAESAR'S: Math. 22.21.

5 Submit your selves unto every ordinance of man for the Lords sake: (1, Pet.
2, 13.) And let every Soul be Subject unto the higher powers; for there is no
power, but of GOD: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore
resists the power, resists the ordinance of GOD; and they that resist shall
receive to themselves damnation. For Rulers are not a terror to good works,
but to the evil Will thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is
good, and ^hou shall have praise of the same; for ^ee is the Minister of GOD,
to thee for good: (Romans 13.1.) For in the light of the Kings Countenance is
life, and his savor is as a Cloud of the latter rain: (Prou. 16, 15.) And as
the dew upon the grass; but his wrath is as the roaring of the Lion: (Prou.
19, 12.) And as the Messenger of death: he that is wise will pacify it: Prou.
16, 14, 20, 2 Math. 22.21.

I counsel thee therefore to keep the Kings commandment, but yet according
to the oath of GOD. And stand not in an evil thing, for he does whatsoever
pleases him. Where the word of a King is, there is power; and who may say unto
him, what do thou: Eccl. 8, 2. Numb. 27, 20.

Ob. How comes it to pass, that so many thousands in a Kingdom, should
subject themselves unto the government of one man?

A. As in Judah, the hand of GOD was to give them one heart to do the
commandment of the King, and of the Princes: (2, Chron. 30.12.) So does he
still bow the hearts of all Men; Even as the heart of one man unto him: (2,
Sam. 19.14.) Whereby all that he commands, they will do; whether soever he
sends them, they will go; according as they hearkened unto MOSES, so will
they hearken unto him: Josh. 1, 16.4, 14.

Q But is this the case of every King, to have all his people in subjection?

A. No: for the Children of Belial say of their King, how shall this man save
us? And do despise him, and will bring him no presents: (1, Sam. 10.27.) And
do despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities: (Iud. 8.) Saying, We will
not have this man rule over us: (Luke 19, 14.) As Sheba the Son of Bichri,
who blew a trumpet, and said, we have no part in David, neither have we
inheritance in the Son of Iesse: 2, Sam. 20.1. Number. 12.1.

Q. What is the danger, of such Rebels, against their Sovereign?

A. Whosoever will not do the Law of the King, let judgment he executed
speedily upon him; whether it be unto death, (...) to banishment, or to
confiscation of ^oods, or to Imprisonment: (Ezra, 7, 26) And if the sons of
ZERVIAH be too ^^ard for him, the Lord shall reward the doer of evil,
according to his wickedness: 2, Sam. 3, 39.

Thus MIRIAM, for speaking against MOSES, became leprous, as white as snow.
(Numb. 12.10.) And the Earth swallowed up DATHAN and ABIRAM, with ^ll that they
had: (Numb. 16.32.) For they do not reject man, but GOD, that he should not
reign over them: 1. Sam. 8.7. 2. Sam. 16.5. Numb. 16.49. Judge.
9.53.9.16.9.10.11.

Q. What may this teach us?

A. To pray, saying; The LORD forbid, that I should stretch forth my hand,
against the LORDS anointed: 1. Sam. 26.11.

2 Curse not the King; no not in thy thoughts; and curse not the rich in thy
bed chamber: for a bird of the air, shall carry thy voice, and that which has
wings, shall tell the matter: Eccles. 10.20.

Ob. But shall even he, that hates right, govern? (Job, 34.17.) For I saw
under the Sun; the place of Judgment, that wickedness was there; and the
place of righteousness, that iniquity was there: (Eccles. 3.16.) Her Rulers
do love with shame, give ye: (Hosea, 4.18.) Shall the throne of iniquity,
have fellowship with thee, which frames mischief, by a Law? Psalm.
94.20.82.5. Eccles. 10.5. Zephan. 3.3. Micha. 3.9.1. Sam. 8.11. Isa. 3.12.10.
1. Habac. 1.2.1.13. Nehem. 5.15. 2. Kings, 24.4. Amos. 6.12.5.7. Isa. 29.21.
Micha. 3.2.

A. EPHRAIM is oppressed, and broken in judgment; because he willingly walked
after the commandment: (Hos. 5.11.) They make the King glad with their
wickedness, and the Princes with their lies: (Hos. 7.3.) Notwithstanding, to
subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approves not: Lam. 3.36.

Wherefore if thou see, the oppression (...) the poor, and violent
perverting of ^^dgement, and Justice in a Province; ^^rvell not at the matter:
for he that (...) higher, than the highest, regards; and ^^re be higher than
they: (Eccles. 5.8.) (...) GOD stands in the congregation of (...) mighty;
he judges among the Gods: Psalm. 82.1.) He does execute the ^^dgement, of
the Fatherless and Wid^^: (Deuteronomy. 10, 18.) And shall judge (...) Righteous, and
the Wicked: for there (...) time there, for every purpose, and (...) every
work: (Eccles. 3, 17.) when ^^e LORD will enter into Iudge^^^nt, with the
ancients of his peo^^, and the Princes thereof: (Isa. 3, 4.) And will power out
his wrath, upon them like Water: (Hosea. 5, 10.) And break them with a rod
of I^^^, and dash them in pieces like a ^^tters vessel: Psalm. 2, 9. Deuteron.
^7, 19. Ecclesiast. 4, 13. Hosea, 5, 5. ^ Sam. 28, 17. 2, Chron. ^5, 27. Micha,
3, 12. Amos, 5, 12. Dan. 4, 25, 33. 1, King. 20, 42. Psalm. 82, 6. Isa. 3, 15.

Q. If this be the condition of Rulers, and of men in Authority, in the
commission of Injustice; what use are they to make of it?

A. 1 Be wise now therefore, O ye Kings: be instructed ye Judges of the
earth: Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son,
least he be angry, and ye perish from the way; when his wrath is kindled, but
a little; blessed are all they that put their trust in him: Psalm. 2, 10.29, 1.
Amos, 5, 24. Prou. 20, 28. 1, Kings, 2, 46.

2 Rob not the Poor, because he is poor; neither oppress the Afflicted in
the gate: for the LORD will plead their cause; and spoil the soul of them
that spoiled them: (Prou. 22, 22.) Deliver them that are drawn unto death, and
those that are ready to be slain: Prou. 24, 11, 12.

Ob. If notwithstanding, what is said, such should continue, to oppress; I
^uch fear, what the end thereof may ^ee?

A. If you be willing, and obedient, Isa. 1, 19.) violence shall no more be
^urd in thy Land; wasting, nor destructi^^ within thy borders: (Isa. 60, 18.)
For ^will turn my hand upon thee; and pure^ purge away thy dross, and take
away ^^l thy tin. And I will restore thy Iud^^s as at first, and thy
Councellers as at the ^eginning: afterward thou shall be cal^ed the City of
Righteousness, the faith^^ll City: Isa. 1, 25.

Ob. I now see cause enough; and I ^ould be contented, to submit my self unto
my Sovereign, and his substitutes (...) the Commonweal; this only trou^leth
me, that I do yet remain in the ^ondition of a Servant?

A. Let every man abide in the same ^ocation, wherein he was called. Art ^hou
called being a Servant? Care not for (...); but yet if thou may be made
free, ^se it rather: for he that is called in the LORD, being a Servant, is
the Lords freeman; likewise also, he that is called being free, is CHRIST'S
servant. 1, Cor. 7, 20.

Q. What then ought to be our carriage toward our Masters?

A. Let as many servants as are under the yoke, count their own Masters,
worthy of all honor; that the Name of GOD, and his Doctrine, be not
blaspheamed: 1, Tim. 6, 1.

2 Servants be obedient unto them that are your Masters, according to the
flesh, with fear, and trembling; in singleness of your heart, as unto CHRIST:
Not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the
will of GOD from the heart; with good will, doing service, as to the LORD, and
not to Men: Ephesians 6, 5. M^th. 8, 9.

Ob. I, and my Master, are both of one brotherhood in CHRIST; why then should I
be subject unto him?

A. They that have believing Masters, let them not despise them, because they
are Brethren; but rather do them ser^^ce: because they are faithful, and
loved, partakers of the benefit: 1, ^im. 6, 2.

Q. How far forth are we to be sub^^ct unto them?

A. Let servants be subject to their own ^^sters, and please them in all
things; not ^^swering again: not purloyning, but ^^ewing all good fidelity,
that they may a^^urne the doctrine of GOD, our Savior (...) all things: Tit. 2
9.

2 Be subject not only to thee good, and ^^ntle, but also to the froward. For
this (...) thanke-worthy, if a man for conscience ^^ward GOD endure grief,
suffering ^rongfully. For what glory is it, if when (...) man be buffetted for
his faults he shall ^ike it patiently? But if when ye do ^^ll, and suffer
for it, ye take it pati^^tly, this is acceptable with GOD. For even hereunto
were ye called; be^^use CHRIST also suffered for us, lea^ing us an example,
that ye should follow ^^s steps: 1. Pet. 2.18.

Q. This is a very hard task imposed; but what good shall I reap thereby?

A. As he that keeps the Fig Tree shall eat the fruit thereof; so he that
waits on his Master shall be honored: (Prou. 27, 18.) A wise Servant, shall
have rule over a Son, that causes shame, and shall have part of the
inheritance, among the Brethren: (Prou. 17, 2.) Knowing that whatsoever good
thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be
bond or free: Ephesians. 6, 8.

Ob. But shall my Master always be let alone in his rigor?

A. No: for GOD who sees thine affliction, and the labor of thy hands will
rebuke thy Master, as he did LABAN: (Genesis 31, 42.) Saying unto him, and such
as he is, ye Masters do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening;
knowing that your Master also is in Heaven: neither is there respect of persons
with him. Ephesians. 6, 9. Genesis 31, 24. Eccles. 7, 21. Job, 31, 13. Deuteronomy. 15, 13,
14, 18.

CHAP. XLIII. Of Peace, Food, and Health.
Q. WHich are the fourth, fifth, and sixth particular ^utward blessings?

A. The fourth is peace. The meek shall delight themselves with the abundanc^
of Peace: (Psalm. 37, 11.) For GOD makes Peace in their borders: (Psalm.
147.14.) And they shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid: (Leuit.
26.6.) And they shall know that their Tabernacle ^s Peace: (Job. 5.24) For when
he gives Peace, who can make Trouble? Job. 34, ^9. Psalm. 48, 8 9. Isay. 33,
20, 48, 18, Iam, 3, 18.

Thus the LORD gave DAVID rest, ^ound about, from all his enemies: (2, Sam. ^,
1.) And Judah and Israel dwelt safe^y; every man under his Vine, and under ^is
Fig tree from Dan, even to Beer^heba, all the days of SOLOMON: (1, King. 4,
25.) So that there was neither Adversary, nor evil occurrent: 1, King. 5, 4.2,
Chron. 20, 30, 2, 15.15. Josh. 23, 1. Acts. 9.31.

But there is no peace, says my GOD, to the wicked: (Isay, 57, 21.) To him
that went out, nor to him that comes in; but great vexations were upon all
the Inhabitants of their Countries: 2, Chron. 15 5. Zach. 8, 10. Ier. 19.9.
Isay, 48.22, 9, 21.

The fifth outward blessing is Food. He gives meat unto them that fear him:
(Psalm. 111.5.) He will abundantly bless their provision, and satisfy their
poor with bread: (Psalm. 132, 15.) Corn shall make the young men cheerful,
and new Wine the Maids: (Zachariah, 9, 17.) Your threshing shall reach unto
the Vintage, and the Vintage shall reach unto the seeds time, and you shall
eat your bread to the full: (Leuit. 26, 5.) And you shall eat of the old
store, and bring forth the old store, because of the new: Leuit. 26, 5, 10.

For of JOSEPH it was said; Blessed of the LORD is his Land, for the sweetness
of Heaven, for the dew, and for the depth lying beneath, and for the sweet
increase of the Sun, and for the sweet increase of the Moon, and for the
sweetness of the ancient Mountains, and for the sweetness of the old Hills,
and for the sweetness of the Earth, and the abundance thereof, and the good
will of him that dwelt in the Bush: Deutr. 33, 13, 11.14.28.4, 7, 13. Isa. 32,
20.30, 23. Psalm. 144, 13.104.13. Ier. 31, 12. Genesis 9.3.27.28. Zach. 8,
11.12.10. 1. Ezekiel. 34, 26. Prou. 27, 18.1, King. 8, 35. Joel. 3, 18.

Ob. I am notwithstanding much pinched with hunger, and thirst, and know not
where to be satisfied?

A. When the poor, and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue
fails for thirst, I the Lord will hear the^, I the God of Israel will not
forsake them. I will open Rivers in high places, and Fountains in the midst of
the valleys, I will make the Wilderness a Poole of water, and the dry Land
springs of water: (Isa. 41, 17.) The The Righteous shall not be ashamed in
evil times, and in the days of Famine they shall be satisfied: Psalm. 37, 19.
Prou. 10.3. Psalm. 65, 9.107, 35. Hos. 2, 21. Mal. 3.11. Deuteronomy. 10, 18. Isa. 62 8
9 58, 11.65.21, 22. Joel. 2, 21.

GOD was the GOD, that fed Jacob all his lifetime: (Genesis 48, 16.) And rained
bread also from Heaven: (Exodus 16, 4, 18.) Wherewith the Israelites were fed
forty years, until they came unto a Land inhabited: (Exodus 15, 35.) Water
also was given unto Sampson out of the iaw bone of an Ass: (Judge. 15.19.) And
to the Israelites out of a Rock in abundance: Numbers, 20, 11. Ruth, 1, 6.1,
King. 17, 16.2, 7, 18, 3, 17, Deuteronomy. 32, 13. Genesis 21, 19.26, 12. Exodus 23, 25.

Q. What may this teach us?

A. Therefore take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye
shall drink. Is not the life more than meat? Behold the fowls of the Air,
for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into Barnes, yet your
heavenly Father feeds them. Are ye not much better than they? etc. Therefore
take no thought, saying; what shall we eat? Or what shall we drink? For
after all these things do the Gentiles seek. For your Heavenly Father knows
that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the Kingdom of GOD,
and his Righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you: Math.
6.25. Joel, 2, 21. Numbers, 11, 22.

2 Be glad then, ye Children of ZION, and rejoice in the LORD, your GOD;
because he has given you, the former Rain, moderately: (Joel, 2 23.) For are
there any among the vanities of the Gentiles, that can cause rain? Or can the
Heavens give showers? Art not thou he, O LORD our GOD? therefore we will wait
upon thee; for thou have made all these things: Ier. 14, 22.

Bless the LORD, O my Soul; who satisfies thy mouth with good things: (Psalm.
103.5.) And let the people praise thee, O GOD, let the people praise thee; then
shall the earth yield her increase, and GOD, even our own God shall bless us?
Psalm. 67, 5. Deuteronomy. 8, 10.

3. Because when goods increase, they are increased that eat them: (Eccl.
5.11.) And because it is good, and comely to eat, and to drink: (Eccles. 5,
18, 3.12.3.13.22.) Therefore go your ways, eat the fat, and drink the
sweet, and send portions to them, for whom nothing is prepared: Neh. 8, 10.

4 Trust in the Lord, and do good; for verily thou shall be fed: (Psalm, 37,
3.) O fear the LORD, ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear
him. The young Lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek the LORD
shall not want any good thing: Psalm, 34, 9. Jeremiah, 11, 4. Deuteronomie,
6.10.8, 11.12.

For the LORD will not suffer the Soul of the Righteous to famish, though ^e
cast away the substance of the wicked: (Prou. 10.3.) The Righteous eats to
the satisfying of his Soul; but the belly of the wicked shall want: (Prou. 13,
25. Isa. 65, 13.) And they shall wander abroad for bread, saying where is it?
(Job. 15.23.) And when I have broken the staff of bread, ten women shall
bake their bread ^n one oven, and they shall deliver their bread by weight; and
they shall eat, and ^ot be satisfied, etc. Yea they shall eat the flesh of
their Sons, and the flesh of their Daughters shall they eat: Leuit. 26 26,
etc. Prou. 13, 2.10, 5, 28, 19. Amos, 5, 16. Deuteron. 11, 16, 28, 24.28.17.18,
28, 38. Isa. 1, 19, 20. Joel. 1, 4. Leuit. 26, 16.19, 20. verses. Ier. 7,
19.20. Hos. 4, 1. Psalm. 106, 14.15. Numb. 11.33. Luke 6, 25. Job, 20.23.
Exodus, 7.20.9, 25.8, 3, 10.15. Hosea, 8, 7.

Ob. You seem to restrain this hunger-bitten Judgment to the wicked Whereas
the contrary has proved true; As of the rich man, and Lazarus: Luke 16, 19.
etc.

A. There is a vanity, which is done upon the Earth; that there be just men,
unto whom it happens according to the work of the wicked: again there be
wicked men, to whom it happens according to the work of the Righteous: Eccl.
8, 14.7.15.

But as for me, I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not seen the
Righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread: (Psalm. 37, 25.)

And although the Fig Tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the
Vines: the labor of the Olive shall fail, and the Fields shall yield no
meat, the flock shall be cut off from the Fold, and there shall be no heard
in the Stalles; yet I will rejoice in the LORD; I will joy in the GOD of my
Salvation: (Habakuc, 3, 17, 18.) As it is written: (Deuteron. 8, 3.) Man shall
not live by Bread only, but by every word, that ^^oceedeth out of the mouth of
GOD: Math. 4 4.

Q Which is the sixth outward bles^^ng GOD will bestow upon us?

A. I will (says GOD,) put none of ^he diseases upon thee, which I have
^rought upon the Egyptians; for I am ^he LORD, that heals thee: (Exodus 15,
26.) Thou shall not be afraid, for ^he terror by night; nor for the arrow
that flies by day; nor for the Pestilence that walks in darkness; nor for
the destruction that wastes at noone day. A thousand shall fall at thy side,
and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall ^ut come nigh thee: Psalm.
91, 5.

Ob. Notwithstanding the Lord does follow me with grievous sickness.

A. The LORD will strengthen thee, upon thy bed of languishing; he will make
^ll thy bed in thy Sickness: (Psalm. 41, 3.) Thy flesh shall be fresher than a
Childs; ^hou shall return to the days of youth: (Job, 33, 25.) For he
makes sore, and binds up; he wounds, and his hand makes whole: Job, 5,
18. Deuteronomy. 7, 15.2, King. 20, 4, 5, 5, 10. Isa. 38, 21. Job, 42, 10. Math. 8, 7.
Luke 17, 19, 18, 42.

Q. Upon what condition shall this Promise be made good?

A. That thou fear the LORD, and depart from evil; for this shall be Health
to thy navell, and marrow to thy bones: (Prou. 3, 7, 8.) Incline thine care
unto his sayings, etc. For they are life unto those that find them, and health
to all their flesh: Prou. 4, 20. Exodus 15, 26.

Q. What then is the danger of living in Sin?

A. It shall come to pass, if thou will not hearken unto the voice of the LORD
thy GOD, to observe, and do all his Commandments, and his statutes, which I
command thee this day, etc. The LORD shall make the Pestilence cleave unto
thee, until he have consumed thee from off the Land. The LORD shall smite
thee with a Consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation: Deuteronomy. 15,
21.

Moreover, he will bring upon thee the diseases of Egypt, and which thou
(...) afraid of; and they shall cleave vn^^hee. Also every Sickness, and
eue^lague, which is not written in (...) book of the Law; them will the ^^RD
bring upon thee, until thou be ^^^troyed: Deuteronomy. 28, 60.27, 35. verses. ^^it.
26, 16, 25. Exodus 9, 9.2, Chron. ^ 15.

Examples: 2, Chron. 21, 18.26, 19. King. 5, 26.2, 1.3.4, 17. Psalm. 78, 50.
^^m. 46, 11.

CHAP. XLIIII. Of Strength, Beauty, and Wisdom.
WHat other Temporal blessing will GOD bestow vp^ his Children?

A. He gives power to the faint, an^ to them that have no might he increase^
Strength. Even the youths shall fain^ and the young men shall utterly fall; b^^
they that wayt upon the LORD, shall r^ new their strength. They shall mount v^
with wings as Eagles, and they shall runn^ and not be weary; and they shall
walk and not faint: Isa. 40, 29.

Thus MOSES being one hundred an^ twenty years old, his eyes were not dimm^
nor his natural force abated: (Deuteronomy. 34 7.) IOSHVA also, at Eighty and five
years, was as strong for War, both to g^ out, and to come in, as when MOSE^
sent him to search the Land: (Ios. 14 11.) It is GOD also that girdeth me with
strength, etc. He teaches my han^ to war, so that a Bow of steel is broken
by mine arm: Psalm. 18, 32, 34. Iud^ 14, 6.15, 14, 16, 3.16, 12, 16, 14.16, 3^
Number. 23, 22.

Q. What may this teach us?

A. Therefore ascribe ye strength vn^^ GOD; his Excellency is over Israel,
an^ h^^ strength is in the Clouds. The God of ^^el is he also that gives
strength, (...) power to his people: blessed be GOD: ^l. 68, 34.

Q. What is the case of such as do a^e their strength?

A. Those that imagine mischief a^st GOD, who had bound, and streng^^ed their
arms: (Hos. 7, 15.) Their ^ngth shall be hunger bitten, and de^^ction shall
be ready at their side. It ^ll devour the strength of their skin, (...) the
first borne of Death shall de^^re their strength: Job, 18, 12, 13.

Q. Which are the eighth and ninth ^^thly Blessings?

A. The eighth is Beauty. For the LORD of hosts shall be for a crown^ (...)
Glory, and for a Diadem of beauty unto (...) people: (Isa. 28, 5.) And will
give (...) to them beauty for ashes: (Isa. 61, 3.) ^^d be as the dew unto
Israel; they shall (...) as the Lilly, and fasten their roots ^he trees of
Libanon: Hos. 14, 6. Psalm. ^13.

Thus JOSEPH was a goodly person and well favored: (Genesis 39, 6) S^ was also
MOSES: (Exodus 2, 2.) A^ DAVID was ruddie, and withal of Be^tifull countenance,
and goodly to look t^ (1, Sam. 16, 12.) SARA also was ve^ fair: Genes. 12, 14
24, 16.29, 1 Esther, 2, 7.

Notwithstanding the LORD sees (...) as man sees: (1, Sam. 16, 7.) For fauo^
is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but Woman that fears the Lord she shall
(...) praised: Prou. 31, 30.

The ninth is Wisdom. For DAVI^ went out whither SAVL sent him, a^^ behaved
himself wisely: (1, Sam. 1 5.) And that in all his ways: (1, Sa^ 18, 14.)
Yea, with more Wisdom, the all the servants of SAVL: 1, Sam. 1^ 30. Deuteronomy. 34,
9. Psalm. 105, 22. Eccl^ 1, 16.

And unto SOLOMON was given wise, and understanding heart; so (...) either
before, or after him, there was no^ like him: (1, King. 3, 12.) For there w^
Wisdom of GOD in him, to do Iudge^ent: 1, King. 3, 28.1.10, 1, 24.2, Sam. ^,
20.2, 20.16, 22.

Moreover, see says GOD, I have cal^d by name Bezaleel, and I have filled him
^ith the spirit of GOD in Wisdom, and ^nderstanding, and in Knowledge, and in
^ll manner of workmanship, to devise cun^ing works: (Exodus 31, 2.) And have
put (...) his heart that he may teach Aholiab: Exodus 35, 34.30, 30.

And in all matters of Wisdom, and ^nderstanding, that the King inquired of
DANIEL, HANANIAH, MASHAEL, and AZARIAH, he found them ten times better, than
all the Magicians, and Astro^ogers that were in all his Realm: Dan. 1, ^0.2,
14, 5, 12.

And does the Plowman, plow all the ^ay to sow? Does he open, and break the
^lods of his ground? When he has made ^laine the face thereof, does he not
cast ^broad the Fitches, and scatter the ^ummin, and cast in the principal
^heat, and the appointed Barley, and the Rye in their place? For his God does
instruct him to discretion, and does teach him: Isa. 28, 24.

Q. Is humane Wisdom of any great worth?

A. Wisdom makes a man's face to shine: (Eccles. 8, 1.) And is good with an
inheritance; and by it there is profit to them, that see the Sun: (Eccles. 7,
11.) For it strengthens the wise, more than ten mighty men, which are in
the City: (Eccles. 7, 19.) For there was a little City, and few men within
it, and there came a great King against it and besiedged it, and built great
bulwarks against it; now there was found in it a poor wise man; and he by
his wisdom delivered the City. Then said I, Wisdom is better then
Strength: Eccles. 9, 14, 9, 16, 18. verses.

Q. What then is the worth of Wisdom, more than of Folly?

A. As the light is more excellent than darkness: (Eccles. 2, 13.) For the
Wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way; but the folly of Fools is
deceit: (Prou. 14.8.13, 16.) A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a
fools heart is at his left: (Eccles. 10, 2.) The words of a wise man's mouth
are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. The beginning
of the words, of his mouth, is foolishness, and the end of his talk, it
mischievous madness: (Eccles. 10, 12. Prou. 15, 2.) Every wise woman also
builds her house; but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands: Prou. 14,
1.

Q. What may this concern the children of Wisdom?

A. That they bless the GOD of heaven, saying; Blessed be the name of God
forever, and ever; for Wisdom, are his. He gives wisdom unto the wise, and
knowledge to them, that know understanding. He reveals the deep, and secret
things, he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him:
Dan. 2, 19.

Q. What is the contrary judgment denounced against the wicked?

A. The LORD shall smite them with madness, and blindness; whereby they shall
grope at noone-dayes, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and they shall be
mad, for the sight of their eyes, which they shall see: (Deuteronomy. 28.28. Job,
5.14.) And they shall have no delight in understanding; but that their heart
may be discovered: Prou. 18.2. Isa. 29.14.

Ob. The council of ANITOPHEL, though wicked, was as if a man had inquired at
the oracle of GOD: (2. Sam. 16.23.) And the men of this world are in their
generation, wiser than the children of light: Luke 16.8.

A. 1 Therefore behold the LORD will do a marvelous work in this people;
even a marveilous work, and a wonder; for the wisdom of their wise men shall
perish, and the understanding of their prudent men, shall be hid: (Isa. 29,
14.) For the Lord turned the counsel of A^ITOPHEL into foolishness: (2, Sam.
15, 31, 17, 14.) And so he takes all such wise men in their own craftiness
and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong: Job, 5.13.

2 As dead flies cause the ointment of the Apothicarie to send forth a
stinking savor; so does a little folly him that i^ in reputation for Wisdom:
Eccles. 10, 1.

3 Such are foolish, they have not known me (says the LORD,) they are
sottis^ children, they have none understanding; they are wise to do evil; but
to do good, they have no knowledge: (Ierem. 4, 22.) For they want the fear of
GOD, which is the beginning of true Wisdom: (Psalm. 111, 10.) And they have
rejected the Word of the LORD, and what Wisdom is in them? Ierem. 8, 9.

CHAP. XLV. Of Wealth.
Q. WHat is the tenth Temporal blessing?

A. Wealth, and riches also, shall be in the house of the man that fears the
LORD: (Psalm. 112, 3.) He shall lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir, as
the stones of the brooks. Yea, the Almighty shall be his defense, and he
shall have plenty of silver: (Job, 22, 24.) For brass, I will bring him gold,
and for iron, I will bring silver; and for wood brass, and for stones iron:
Isa. 60, 17. Prou. 8, 21.

Thus ABRAHAM was rich in Cattle, in Silver, and Gold: Genesis 13, 2, 6. verses,
26, 13.30, 43.32, 10. Job, 1, 3, 42, 2.

Q. When GOD has fulfilled this promise upon any, what is to be done?

A. Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded; that
they do good, and be rich in good works: 1. Tim. 6.17.

2 Therefore thou shall remember the LORD thy GOD; for it is he that gives
thee power to get wealth: (Deuteronomy. 8.18.) And it is his blessing that makes
rich, and adds no sorrow with it: Prou. 10.22.

Q. Does not GOD, in this kind, bless the wicked, living wickedly; as well as
his own children, in the use of lawful means?

A. In all labor there is profit, but the talk of the lips tends only to
poverty: (Prou. 14, 23.) He that oppresses the Poor to increase his riches,
and he that gives to the rich, shall surely come to want: (Prou. 22, 16.) He
that hastes to be rich has an evil eye, and considers not that poverty
shall come upon him: (Prou. 28, 22.) He that loves pleasure shall be a poor
man, and he that loves Wine, and oil shall not be rich: Prou. 21, 17.24,
30.21, 5, 10, 4, 13, 11, 12, 27.

Ob. I do observe the wicked to thrive more than many of GODS own children.

A. Better is a little with righteousness, than great revenues without right:
(Pro. 16, 8.) For treasures of wickedness profit not: (Prou. 10.2.) And what
good is there to the owners thereof, save the beholding of them with their
eyes? Eccles. 5, 11. Prou. 12, 27.19, 22.

2 As in the house of the righteous is much treasure, so in the revenues of the
wicked is trouble: (Prou. 15.6.) Therefore much better is a little with the
fear of the LORD, than great treasure, and trouble therewith: Prou. 15, 16.
Eccles. 5, 19, 3, 12, 13. verses. 8 15. Psalm. 39, 6.

3 There is an evil which I have seen under the Sun; namely, riches kept
for the owners thereof to their hurt: (Eccles. 5.13.) Bread of deceit is sweet
to a man; but afterward his mouth shall be filled with gravel: (Prou. 20,
17.) The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in
the day of Gods wrath: (Job, 20, 28.) when the rust of their Gold shall be a
witness against them, and shall eat their flesh as it were fire: Iam. 5.3.
Prou. 28, 20.21, 6. Math. 6, 24. Psalm. 49, 11. Luke 12, 17, 20.

4 They are disquieted in vain, he heapeth up riches, and knows not who
shall gather them: (Psalm. 39, 6.) And though they heap up silver as the dust,
and prepare raiment as the clay; they may prepare it; but the just shall put it
on, and the innocent shall divide the silver: (Job, 27, 16.) For to the sinner
GOD gives travail, to gather, and to heap up, that he may give to him that
is good before GOD: (Eccles. 2, 26.) And the wealth of the Sinner is laid up
for the Just: Prou. 13, 22. Psalm. 49, 10. Isa. 23, 18. Genes. 31, 1, 31, 8, 9.
Exodus 3, 22.12, 35, 22, 12. Esther, 8, 1, 2. Psalm. 105, 43. Ios. 24, 13, 11,
23. Deuter. 6, 11.2, 35, 3, 3, 4.3.12. 1, King. 10, 10. Eccles. 5, 13.2, 22.

Q. What use is to be made hereof?

A. 1 Go to now ye rich men, weep, and howl for your miseries that shall
come upon you: Iam. 5, 1.

2 Therefore, let not thine heart (who art righteous,) be envious against
sinners; but let it be in the fear of the LORD continually: (Prou. 23, 17)
Neither choose thou any of his ways: Prou. 3, 31.

CHAP. XLVI. Of favor with Men; a good Name, and Honor.
Q. WHich are the eleventh, and twelfth, and thirteenth temporal blessings?

A. The tenth is, the favor of Men. He that loves pureness of heart, for
the grace of his lips, the King shall be his friend: (Prou. 22, 11.) And when
the ways of a man please the LORD, he will ^ake his enemy to become his
friend: Prou. 16, 7. Ier. 15.11. Prou. 28.^3.

For when ESAV saw JACOB coming toward him, he ran to meet JACOB, and
embraced him, and fell on his ^ecke, and kissed him: (Genesis 33.4.^0.) GOD gave
the people favor also in the sight of the Egyptians: (Exodus 3,
21.11.3.12.36.) And extended mercy unto EZRA, before the King and his
Counselors: (Ezra, 7, 28,) ARTAXEREXS the King, also granted unto NEHEMIA,
according to the good hand of his GOD upon him: (Neh. 2, 8.) And ESTHER
obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her: Esth. 2, 15.
Genesis 26.26.11. verses, 39, 4, 39.21, 33, 4. Ruth. 2, 13.1, 16, 17. 1, Sam. 2,
26 1, 18, 1.3, 1, 18.16, 1, 19, 1, 1, 24.16.1.26, 17 1, 20.17.31.1.27, 6. 1,
Chron. 12, 38. Ezra. 6, 22.7, 28, Esth. 8, 17, Ier. 39, 11. Dan. 1, 9. Act.
21.40, 24.23, 27.3.

The twelfth, is a good Name: for thou shall be hid from the scourge of the
tongue: (Job. 5 21.) And thy good name shall be better than a precious
ointment: (Eccl. 7, 1.) And though for thy transgression I do give JACOB to
the curse, and Israel to reproaches: (Isa. 43, 28.) Yet upon thy repentance I
will bring forth thy Righteousness as the light, and thy Judgment as the noone
day: (Psalm. 37, 6.) When the name of the wicked shall rot: Prou. 10, 7, 12.8.
Hosea, 12, 14.

But woe be unto the wicked, when all men shall speak well of them; for so did
their Fathers to the false Prophets: Luke 6, 26.

The thirteenth outward blessing is Honor, If any man will serve me, him will
my Father honor: (John. 12, 26.) And it shall come to pass, that if thou
shall hearken diligently unto the LORD thy GOD, to observe and do all his
Commandments which I command thee this day; that the LORD, thy GOD shall set
thee on high, above all the Nations of the Earth: (Deuteron. 28, 1.) And thou
shall ride on the ^igh places of the Earth: (Isa, 58.14.) And I will make you a
name and a praise, ^boue all people of the Earth, says the LORD: (Zeph. 3.20.)
The LORD ^^all make thee the head, and not the tail: Deuteronomy. 28.13.) And many
shall make ^^ite unto thee: (Job. 11, 19.) And bow before thee: Prou. 14, 19.
Numb. 24.7. ^sa. 45, 14. Reu. 3.9. Job. 36, 7, 11.9.1, Sam. 24, 20.

Thus JOSEPH was set over all the Land of Egypt: (Genesis 41 41,) For the King
sent, and loosed him, even the Ruler ^f the people and let him go free. He
made ^im Lord of his House, and Ruler of all ^is Substance: to bind his Princes
at his ^leasure: (Psalm. 105.20. Psalm. 78.70, 71.) And King NABVCHADNEZZAR made
DANIEL a great man, even a Ruler over the whole Province of Babylon, (Dan. 2,
48) King AHASHVERVS set the Royal Crown upon ESTHERS head, and made her
Queen instead of VASTI: Esth. 2, 17.

MORDECAY was by HAMAN brought on Horseback through the street of the City;
and he proclaimed before him, thu^ shall it be done unto the man whom the King
delights to honor: (Esth. 6.11.) For MORDECAY being of the seed of the
JEWS, HAMAN could not prevail against him, but did fall before him: Est. 6,
13. Dan. 5, 29. Josh. 4, 14. 1, Sam. 18.7. 1, Chron. 29, 25.2, 32.33, 2, 15, 9.
1, King. 4.21.

Thus GOD raises the poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of the
dunghill, that he may set him with Princes, even with the Princes of the
people: (Psalm. 113, 7.) But as for evil men, they bow before the good, and the
wicked at the gates of the Righteous: (Prou. 14, 19.) Their enemies will he
cloth with shame; but upon them shall their Crown flourish: (Psalm. 132, 18.)
The wise shall inherit glory; but shame shall be the promotion of Fools:
Prou. 3, 35, 14, 34. Deuteronomy. 28, 43, 28, 68. Isa. 43, 27, 28.

Q. What may this teach us?

A. Therefore get wisdom, and exalt ^er, and she shall promote thee, she
shall ^^ing thee to honor when thou do em^race her; she shall give to thine
head an ^nament of Grace; a Crown of Glory, shall she deliver to thee: Prou.
4, 7.

2 Pray for the Church, saying; Let the people serve thee, and Nations bow
down to thee; be LORD over the Brethren, and let thy mothers Sons bow down
to thee: Genesis 27, 29.

Ob. Notwithstanding there is an evil which I have seen under the Sun, as
an error which proceeds from the Ruler. Folly is set in great dignity, and
the rich sit in low place. I have seen Servants upon Horses, and Princes
walking, as Servants upon the Earth: Eccl. 10, 5.

A. As Snow in Summer, and as Rain i^ Harvest; so is Honor not seemly for a
Fool: (Prou. 26, 1.) For as he that binds a stone in a sling, so is he
that gives Honor to a Fool: Proverbs, 26, 8.

2 Though his Excellency mount up to the Heavens, and his head reach unto the
Clouds: yet shall he perish for ever, like his own Dung, they which have
seen him shall say where is he? He shall fly away as a dream, and shall
not be found, yea, he shall be chased away as a Vision in the Night. The eye
also which saw him, shall see him no more, neither shall his place any more be
found. His Children shall seek to please the poor: (Job. 20.6.) His Root
shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branches be cut off, his
remembrance shall perish from the Earth, and he shall have no name in the
Street: Job, 18, 16. Isay, 28, 3. Psalm, 49.12.

3 He has no full content in it. For though HAMAN were advanced; and set above
all the Princes that were with him, so as all the Kings Servants, that were in
the Kings Gate, bowed, and reverenced him; the King commanding the same,
concerning him: (Esth. 3, 1.2.) and though he alone were invited with the
King, unto the Banquet of the Queen, what does this avail him; so ^ng as he
sees MORDECAY, the Jew (...) in the Gate? Esther, 5, 13.

4 All this have I also seen, and applied my heart unto, every ^orke that is
done under the Sun: there is a time, wherein one man rules over mother to
his hurt: Ecclesiastes, 8, 9.

Of the Use of Earthly things.

Q. You have now, something satisfied my mind, concerning outward things: what
therefore may the promise of so many Temporal blessings ^each us?

A. 1. Let your Conversation be without Covetousness; and be content with
such things as you have: for he has said; I will never leave thee, nor
forsake thee: (Heb. 13, 5.) But seek ye first, the Kingdom of GOD, and his
Righteousness: and all these things, shall be added unto you: Math. 6, 33.

2 I know that there is no good in these things; but for a man to rejoice, and
to do good in his life. And also that every man should eat, and drink, and
enjoy the good of his labor: it is the gift of God: Eccl. 3, 12, 13.

3 As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same, one to
another, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of GOD: 1 Pet. 4, 10.

4 Whether ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do; do all to the Glory of
GOD: (1, Cor. 10 31.) Saying; How great is thy goodness, which thou have laid
up for them that fear thee, before the Sons of men: (Psalm. 31, 19.) Blessed
be the Lord, who daily ladeth us with his blessings: even the God of our
Salvation: Psalm. 68, 19.

5 What man is he, that desires Life, and loves many days; that he may see
good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile: depart
from evil, and do good: Psalm. 34, 12.

CHAP. XLVII. Promises concerning Posterity.
Oh. HAd I all these Temporal blessings in possession, thus promised, yet O
LORD GOD, what will thou give me, seeing I go childlesse? Genesis 15, 2.

A. O that thou had hearkened to my Commandments, then had thy seed been ^s
the Sand, and the offspring of thy bowels, like the gravel thereof: thy name
should not have been out off, nor destroyed from before me: Isa. 48, 18.18.

Q. But what if I do repent, and amend?

A. Then be thou fruitful, and multiply: (Genesis 9, 1.) Let thy wife be as a
fruitful vine, by the sides of thine house; thy Children like Olive plants
round about thy table. Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that fears the
LORD: (Psalm. 128, 3.) Lo children are an heritage of the Lord, and the fruit
of the womb is his reward: Psalm. 127, 3.

For the Lord opened LEAHS womb: (Genesis 29, 31.) HANNAH also whose womb before
time, the LORD had shut up, yet did she bare a Son, and called his name
SAMVEL: 1, Sam. 1, 20, 25, 21, Ruth. 4, 13. Judge. 13.2, 24.

Thou shall know also that thy seed shall be great, and thy offspring as the
grass of the Earth: Job, 5, 25. Psalm. 113.9. Genesis 4.1.4. 25.33.5.

Ob. After I am waxed old, shall I have pleasure; my Lord being old also?
(Genesis 18, 12.) Nay my Lord, thou man of GOD, do not lie unto thine handmaid,
2, King. 4, 16.

A. Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed, says GOD, I
will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and thou shall have a
Son: (Genesis 18, 14.) And the Lord did unto SARAH as he had spoken: (Genesis
21.1.) For through faith she received strength to conceive seed, and was
delivered of a child, when she was past age; because she judged him faithful
who had promised. Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead,
so many as the Stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by
the Sea shore innumerable: Heb. 11.11. 2, King. 4. 14. Luke 1, 7, 13.1, 57.60.

Ob. I have seen many of GODS Children, both live, and dye Childlesse?

A. Let not therefore the Eunuch say; Behold, I am a dry tree. For thus says
the LORD to the Eunuchs, that keep my Sabbaths, and choose the thing that
pleases me, and takes hold of my Covenant; even to them will I give in mine
House, and within my Walls a place, and a name better than of Sons, and of
Daughters; I will give them an everla^ting Name, that shall not be cut off:
Isa. 56, 3.

Ob, But this fear yet remains, that when my Child comes to the birth, my
wife shall have no strength to be delivered.

A. Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth, says the LORD?
Shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb says thy GOD? (Isa. 66.9.)
For SARAH said, GOD has made me laugh, so that all that hear, will laugh with
me: (Genesis 21.6.) Therefore fear not ZACHARIAS, for thy wife ELIZABETH shall
bear thee a Son, and thou shall have joy, and gladness, and many shall
rejoice at his birth: Luke 1.13, 14.

Q. If the having of Children be of the blessing of GOD to the Righteous, what
shall the wicked have?

A. Give them O LORD, what thou will give? Give them a miscarrying womb, and
dry breasts: (Hos. 9, 14) And write ye this man childlesse: (Ier. 22, 30.) For
he shall neither have Son nor Nephew among his people, nor any remainder
among his dwellings. They that come after him shall be astonished at his day, as
they that went before were affrighted. Surely such are the dwellings of the
wicked, and this is the place of him that knows not God: Job. 18, 19. 2, Sam.
6, 23.

Ob. But who more then the wicked, do abound with Children?

A. If their Children be multiplied it is for the sword. (Job. 27, 14.) Also I
will send wild beasts among them, which shall rob them of their Children:
(Leuit. 26, 22.) For the face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to
cut off the remembrance of them from the Earth: Psalm. 34, 16, 37, 28.1, King.
14, 10, 1, 15, 29.1, 16.3, 41.16. 11, 12.1, 21.21.25 2.9.8.2.10.7.11. Hos. 14.
1. Ezekiel. 24.21.25. 2, Sam. 12, 9.2, 12.18.

Q. When I have Children, what is the comfort I shall receive by them? Eccl. 2,
18, 19.

A. The Father of the Righteous shall greatly rejoice, and he that begets a
wise Son shall have joy in him. His Father, and Mother shall be glad, and she
that bare him shall rejoice: (Prou. 23, 24) For as arrows are in the hand of
the mighty man, so are Children of the youth. Happy is the man that has his
Quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the
enemies in the gate: Psalm. 127.4.

For NOAH'S two Sons covered their Fathers nakedness: (Genesis 9, 23.) And
JOSEPH nourished his old Father, and Brethren in the time of dearth: (Genesis 45,
9, 50, 1.) And NAOMIE her Son, was a restorer of her life, and a nourisher of
her old age: Ruth, 4, 15. 2, Chron. 2, 12. Gen 28, 7, 45, 23.

But SENAGHERIB as he was worshipping in the House of NISROCH his GOD, that
ADRAMELECH, and SHAREZER his Sons, smote him with the Sword that he dyed: 2,
King. 19, 37.

Ob. When God by death takes me away, what the miseries are, which shall then
befall my Children, I know not.

A. A good man walking in his integrity, his Children are blessed after him:
(Prou. 20, 7.) For he leaves his inheritance to his Childrens children; and
the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just: (Prou. 13, 22.) His seed
shall be mighty on the Earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed:
(Psalm. 112, 1.) They shall spring up among the Grass, as willowes by the water
courses: (Isa. 44 4.) Their seed also shall be known among the Gentiles, and
their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them
that they are the seed, which the Lord has blessed: Isa. 61, 9.

Know therefore, that the LORD thy GOD, he is God, the faithful God, which
keeps Covenant, and mercy, with them that love him, and keep his
Commandments, to a thousand Generations: Deuteronomy. 7, 9. Isa. 65, 23. Psalm. 102,
28.103.17. 1, Sam. 25, 28.1, King. 9, 4. Exodus 20, 6. Heb. 11.20. Genesis 25, 11.
Prou. 11, 21. Psalm. 146.9.

But it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in the house of the
wicked; shall come, and crouch to the Righteous for a piece of silver and a
morsel of bread, and shall say; put me I pray thee into one of the Priests
offices, that I may eat a piece of bread: (1, Sam. 2, 36.) For his riches
perish by evil travel, and he begets a Son, and there is nothing in his
hand: (Eccl. 5, 14.) Neither shall his offspring be satisfied with bread:
Job. 27, 14.

Ob. What assurance can you give me, that my Children will not prove wicked,
whereby to be liable to the curse, as well as other Children, whose Parents are
out of the Covenant?

A. If the first fruits be holy, the lump is also holy; and if the Root be
holy, so are the brvnches. (Romans 11.16.) And as for me, this is my Covenant
with you; my spirit that is upon thee, and my word which I have put in thy
mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor
out of the mouth of thy Seeds seed: says the LORD, from henceforth, and for
ever: (Isa. 59, 21.) For the LORD made not this Covenant with our Fathers; but
with us, even us, who are all of us alive this day: (Deuteronomy. 5, 3.) For God being
the God, not of the faithful only, but also of their seed: (Genesis 17, 7.) Thou
shall be saved, and thy House: Acts, 16, 31. Genesis 17, 21.4.4.

Ob. One of the Parents themselves may be out of the Covenant; how then can
this Covenant belong unto their posterity?

A. The unbelieving Husband is sanctified by the Wife, and the unbelieving
wife, is sanctified by the husband; else were your Children unclean, but now
are they holy: 1, Cor. 7, 14.

Ob. It were much more to my comfort, if we were both of us within the
Covenant?

A. If any man obey not the Word, they may without the Word be won, by the
conversation of the wives: (1, Pet. 3, 1.) For what know thou, O wife,
whether thou shall save thy husband? Or how know thou, O Man, whether thou
shall save thy wife? 1. Cor. 7, 16.

Ob. But does not the Son bear the iniquity of his Father? Else whence this
Proverb? The Fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the Childrens teeth are set
on edge: Ezekiel. 18, 2.

A. The Fathers shall not be put to death for the Children, neither shall the
children be put to death for their fathers; every man shall be put to death
for his own sin: (Deuteronomy. 24, 16.) And every man shall bear his own burden:
Gal. 6, 5.

What mean they then to use this Proverb, saying: The Fathers have eaten
sower grapes, and the Childrens teeth are set on edge? (Ezekiel. 18, 2.) For every
one shall dye in his own iniquity, every man that eats the sower grape, his
teeth shall be set on edge: Ier. 31.29, 30. Ezekiel. 18, 18. Number. 14, 29. Deuteronomy.
1.39. 1, King. 14, 13, 15, 3.

Q. What may the Children of wicked parents learn hence?

A. Not to walk in the statutes of their Fathers, nor to observe their
judgments, nor to defile themselves with their Idols: (Ezekiel. 20.18.) to be as
their Fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, etc. (Psalm. 78, 8.)
hardening their hearts as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation
in the Wilderness, etc. (Psalm. 95, 8.) Unto whom the former Prophets have
cried, saying; Thus says the LORD of hosts, Turn ye now from ^our evil
ways, and from your evil do^ngs; but they did not hear nor hear. ^^n unto
me, says the LORD: Zach. 1.4.

Q. But what if the Children of godly parents prove wicked? Shall the
godliness of the parents shelter them from the judgments of the wicked?

A. As I live, says the LORD, though Conaiah, the son of Iehoiakim, King of
Judah, were the Signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck him thence: Ier,
22, 24.

I said indeed unto ELY; That thy house, and the house of thy Fathers, shall
walk before me for ever: but now be it far from me; for them that honor me
I will honor, and they that despise me, shall be lightly esteemed: (1. Sam.
2. 30.) Wherefore cursed be CANAAN, a servant, of servants shall he be unto
his Brethren: (Genesis 9.25.) and even as EPHRAIM being wicked, shall bring forth
his children to the Murderer: Hos. 9, 13, 9, 12. 1, Sam. 4, 11. 1, King. 2,
27. 1, 11.11, 11.14, 11.23, 11, 31.

Q. What if parents, and children, do both of them prove wicked? Psalm. 106, 6.

A. GOD will then visit the iniquities of the Fathers upon their Children, unto
the third, and fourth Generation, of them that hate him: (Exodus 20, 5.) Whereby
their iniquities, and the iniquities of their Fathers shall be together, etc.
And he will measure their work, into their own bosom: Isa. 65, 7.

Q. What means are then to be used, whereby these evils being prevented, I
may have comfort in my Children?

A. 1 Your power being to lead about a wife being a sister: (1, Cor. 9, 5.)
Marry to whom you will; only in the LORD: (1, Cor. 7.39.) Thou shall not take
a Wife that is a whore, or profane, neither shall you take a woman, put away
from her Husband: (Leuit. 21, 7.) None of you shall approach to any that is
near of affini^^ie to him, to uncover their naked^esse: (Leuit. 18, 6.) Nor
yet as the Sons of GOD in the old World, who when they saw the Daughters of
men that they were fair, took them wives, of all which they chose: (Genesis 6,
1.) But as ABRAHAM who would not take a wife unto his Son of the Daughters of
Canaan, among whom he dwelt, but of his own Country, and Kindred: Genesis 24,
3, 6, 3.

2 Take heed to your Spirit, and let none deal treacherously with the wife of
his youth; for did he not make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And
wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed: (Malac. 2, 15.) Therefore
make a Covenant with thine eyes; for why should thou think upon a Maid?
Job, 31, 1, 9, 10. verses. Math. 19, 4. Mal. 2, 13, 14. Leu. 18, 20.20, 10. 2,
Sam. 12, 11. Hos. 4, 10.

3 Do as NAOMI did, who took her Child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
a Nurse unto it: (Ruth, 4, 16.) Which that HANNAH might also do, she went not
up to offer unto the LORD her yearly offering, until her child was weyned: 1,
Sam. 1, 22. Exodus 2, 8. Lam. 4, 3.

4 Suffer your little Children to come unto CHRIST, to be Baptized, and forbid
them not: (Math. 19, 14.) And then lend them unto the LORD, as long as they
live: 1, Sam. 1, 28.

5 Observe, and hear all the words which I command thee, so shall it be well
with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever; when thou do that
which is good, and right in the sight of the LORD thy GOD: (Deuteronomy. 12, 28.) For
the Just walking in his integrity, his Children are blessed after him: (Prou.
20, 7.) Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished; but the
seed of the Righteous shall be delivered: Prou. 11, 21. Number. 25, 12. 2, Tim. 1,
5. 2, King. 10, 30. Prou. 13, 22.14, 26.

6 Do as JACOB, who by Faith, when he was a dying, blessed both the ^^nes of
JOSEPH, and worshipped, lea^ing upon the top of his Staff, (Heb. 11, ^1.) and
saying; The Angel, which re^emed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let
my name, be named on them, and ^he name of my Fathers ABRAHAM, and ^SAAC, and
let them grow into a multi^de, in the midst of the Earth: (Genesis ^8, 16.) And
as plants grown up in their ^outh; let my Daughters be as corners ^ones,
polished after the similitude of a Palace: Psalm. 144, 12. Ruth, 4, 11, 12. ^,
Sam. 6 20.2, 7, 27. Deuteronomy. 33, 24.

7 Because, if you train up your children in the way they are to go, they
will ^ut depart from it when they are old: (Prou. 22, 6.) Therefore you Fathers
provoke not your Children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture, and
admonition of the Lord: (Ephesians. 6, 4.) And let the words which I command you
this day be in thy heart, and do ye teach them diligently unto your Children:
(Deuteronomy. 6, 6, 20.) And let your Children tell their Children; and their Children
another Generation: Joel. 1, 3. Psalm. 78, 1.44.1. Josh. 4.5, 4, 21. Exodus 12,
26.13.8, 14, 5. Numb. 31.54. Isa. 38, 19. Deuteronomy. 32, 46. 2, Tim. 1, 5, 6.2, 3,
15.

Q. This admonition I shall the better give, if you will give me some direction
therein.

A. Say thus unto thy Child; my Son hear the instruction of thy Father, and
forsake not the Law of thy Mother; for they shall be an ornament of Grace unto
thy head, and chains about thy neck: (Prou. 1, 8.) Bind them continually upon
thine heart, and tie them about thy neck; when thou go it shall lead thee,
and when thou sleep it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest it shall
talk with thee: (Prou. 6, 21.) For I was my Fathers Son, tender, and only
beloved in the sight of my Mother, He taught me also, and said unto me, let
thy heart retain my words, keep my Commandments, and live. Get wisdom, get
understanding, forget is not, neither decline from the words of my ^outh.
Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee; love her, and she shall keep
thee. Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom, and with all
thy ^etting get understanding: exalt her, and ^he shall promote thee, she
shall bring thee ^o Honor, when thou do embrace her. She shall give to
thine head ^n Ornament of Grace, a Crown of Glory shall she deliver to thee:
Prou. 4, 3, 1, 10. Exodus 13, 14. Deuteronomy. 6, 20.1, King. 2, 2.

Thus if thou shall do, all thy Children shall be also taught of GOD, and
great shall be the prosperity of thy Chil^ren: Isa. 54, 13.

Ob. I have thus far proceeded already in the instruction of my Son, yet is
he never the better.

A. Then say unto him; what my Son! And what the Son of my womb! And what
the Son of my vows! (Prou. 31.1.) Why do thou such things? For I hear of
your evil dealings, by all this people, Nay my Sons, for it is no good
report I hear; ye make the LORDS people to transgress. If one man sin
against another, the Judge, shall judge him: but if a man sin against the
LORD, who shall entreat for him? (1. Sam. 2, 23.) Thus if thou correct thy
Son, he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight to thy Soul:
Prou. 29, 17.15, 31. 1, King. 2, 1.2, 11.

Ob. But my Son will not be chastised with words; for say I to him what I
can, he will do what himself lists.

A. Folly is bound in the heart of a Child; but the rod of Correction will
drive it far from him: (Prou. 22, 15,) The blewnesse of the wound, cleanses
away evil; so do stripes the inward parts of the belly: Pro^. 2^, 30.

Th^re^^re withold not correction from the Child, for if thou beatest him
with the ^od he shall not dye. Thou shall bea^e him with the Rod, and shall
deliver his Soul from Hell: (P^^^. 2^, 14.) For the Rod, and reproof give
Wisdom, but a Child left to himself, brings his Mother to shame: Prou.
29, 15. 2, Chron. 22, 3. 1, King. 1, 5, 6. Prou. 13, 24 19, 18.

Q. What if upon my Sons commit^ing of some gross sin, I should neg^ect to
chast^se him?

A. It shall be unto thee, as it was with ELI, unto whom it was said; Because
thy Son has made himself vile, and ^ho^ have not restrained him, therefore
(says GOD) I have sworn to the house of ELI, that the iniquity of ELIES
House shall not be purged with Sacrifice, nor offering for ever: (1, Sam.
3.14.) And so it came to pass, that his Sons were slain: (1, Sam. 4, 11)
And ELI himself fell from off his Seat backward, by the side of the Gate, and
his neck brake, and he dyed: etc. And his Daughter in Law PHINEHAS Wife was
with child, near to be delivered; who when she heard these tidings, she bowed
her self, and travailed, and so dyed: 1, Sam. 5.18.

Ob. My fear is, that when my Son is past the rod, he do as ESAV, who by his
marriage of the Daughter of the Hittits, was a grief of mind unto ISAAC, and
REBECHA: (Genesis 26.34.) So my Son by the like marriage, be a grief unto me.

A. For prevention, Say unto him; Is there never a woman among the Daughters of
the Brethren, or among all my people, that thou go to take a wife of the
uncircumcised Philistin^s? (Judge. 14, 3.) Thou shall not make marriages with
them: (Deuteronomy. 7, 3.) Nor take a wife of them: Genesis 28.1, 34.14. Ez^^. 9, 12.
Nehem. 13.25. 1, King. 16, 31.

For did not SOLOMON, King of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many
Nations, was there no King like unto him, who was beloved of his God: and God
made him King over all Israel; nevertheless, even him did Out landish women
cause to sin: (Neh. 13.26.) And did not Israel, when they took the Daughters
of the Cananites to be their wives and gave their Daughters to their Sons,
serve their GODS? (Judge. 3.6.) Did not Ahazia also walk in the way of the
house of Ahab, in doing evil in the sight of the LORD a^ did the House of
Ahab? (2. King. 8, 27.) And will you again break God, Commandments, and
join in affinity with such? (Ezra. 9, 14.) Will you deal thu^ treacherously,
and commit this abomination in Israel; in profaning the holiness of the Lord,
which he loved, and marry the Daughter of a strange God? The Lord will cut off
the man that does this; the Master, and the Scholar, out of the Tabernacles of
JACOB, and him that offers an offering to the Lord of Hosts: Mal. 2, 11.
Josh. 23 12. Numb. 33.55,

Q. The labor of Parents in educating their Children, seems to be great; what
recompense therefore in liew thereof shall Children return unto their Parents?

A. They shall fear every man his mother and his Father: (Leu^^. 19.3.) And
shall obey their Parents, for that is right. They shall honor their Father,
and Mother which is the first Commandment with promise: Ephesians. 6, 1. P^ou. 23,
22. 1, King. 2, 19. Ier. 35, 6. Numb. 30.3.

Ob. There is a Generation that curses their Father and does not bless their
Mother: Prou, 30, 11.

A. The eye that mocketh at his Father, and despises to obey his Mother, the
Ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young Eagles shall eat it:
(P^^u. 30 17.) And every one that curses his Father, or his Mother shall be
surely put to death: he that has cursed his Father, or h^s Mother, his blood
shall be upon him: (Leuit. 20, 9) And his lamp shall be put out in obscure
darkness: (Prou. 20 20.) Y^^ cursed be he that sets light by his Father,
or his mother, and all the people shall say, Amen; Deuteronomy. 27, 16.28, 24.

CHAP. XLVIII. The Use of all the Promises.
Ob. WHat may these blessings on our selves, and our posterity teach us?

A. Go therefore, and sit before the Lord, and say, Who am I O Lord God, and
what is my house, that thou have brought me hitherto? And this was yet a small
thing in thy sight, O Lord God; but thou have spoken also of thy Servants house
for a great while to come; and is this the manner of man, O Lord God? And what
can I say more unto thee? etc. And now O Lord God, thou art that God who have
promised this goodness unto thy Servant; therefore now let it please thee, to
bless the house of thy Servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for
thou O Lord God, have spoken it, and with thy blessing let the house of thy
Servant be blessed for ever: 2, Sam. 7, 19, 28, 29. verse^.

2 Because it shall be said of JACOB, and of Israel, what has GOD done? (N^mb.
23, 23.) Return unto thine own house and show how great things the LORD has
done for thee: (Luke 8, 39.) And rejoice before the Lord your God, ye and your
Sons and your Daughters, and your Men Servants, and your Maidservants, Deuteronomy.
12, 12, 16, 11.15. Isay. 12.4.

Saying; It is a good thing to give thanks unto God, and to sing praise unto
thy name, O thou most high; to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning,
and thy faithfulness every night: (Psalm. 92, 1.) For many O Lord my God are
thy wonderful works which thou have done, and thy thoughts which are to us
ward they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee; if I would declare and
speak of them, they are more than can be numbered: (Psalm. 40, 5.) Thy mercy,
also O Lord, is in the Heavens, and thy faithfulness reaches unto the Clouds.
Thy righteousness is like the great Mountains, thy judgments are a great
Deep: (Psalm. 36, 5.)

How precious are thy thoughts unto me O GOD; how great is the sum of them?
^f I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: Psalm.
139.17.31.19.^2.4.5.

Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power,
and night, be unto our GOD: (R^u. 7.12.) For ever, and ever: (1. Tim. 1.17.)
and from everlasting, to everlasting; and let ^ll the people say, Amen: Psalm.
106.48.63.3.4.69.30.31. Isa. 63.7.25.1. Psalm.
104.33.34.1.35.28.116.13.40.9.45.17. Exodus 15.11. Psalm.
57.7.147.1.33.1.34.3.97.1^.68.4.30.4.47.6.7. Psalm.
72.18.135.1.19.136.1.103.20.150.6.72.19.

CHAP. XLIX. The properties of GODS Promises.
Q. GReat cause indeed have we thus to give thanks; for here are many Promises,
and for all purposes, both great, and precious, if they be as true, as good.

A. These things says the Amen, the faithful, and true witness, (Reu. 3.14)
are the true sayings of GOD, (Revel. 19.9.) I JESUS have sent mine Angel to
testify these things in the Churches. (Reu. 22.16.) Therefore write, these
words are true, and faithful. (Reu. 21.5.22, 6.) For GOD will perform his
truth to JACOB, and his mercy to ABRAHAM, which he has sworn to our
Fathers, from the days of old: (Mi^h. 7.^0.) He confirms the word of his
Ser^^nt, and he performs the counsel of his Messengers: (Isa. 44, 26.) He
said not unto the seed of JACOB; Seek ye my face in vain, I the LORD speak
righteousness, I declare the things that are right: (Is^. 45 19.) For it is
GOD that cannot lie who has thus promised, before the World began: (Titus, 1,
2.) When efore let GOD be true, and every man a liar, as it is written; that
thou might be Justified in thy sayings, and overcome when thou art Judged:
Romans 3.4. 2, Cor. 1.18. P^al. 58.11.33.5.12, 6.30, 5. Number. 23, 19.

Q. What good witnesses can you produce, that may convince us of the truth of
these things?

A. Though (says CHRIST,) I bear record of my self, yet my record is true. I
am one that bear witness of my self, and the Father that has sent me
bears witness of me: (Io^. 8, 14, 18.) who is true; and I speak to the
world, the things which I have heard from him: (Ioh. 8, 26.) The Disciple also
whom JESUS loved test^fied these things, and we know that his testimony is
true: (Ioh. 21.24.) JOHN indeed did no miracle, but all things that JOHN spoke
of this man were true: (Ioh. 10, 41.) And every one that has received his
testimony has set to his seal that GOD is true: Ioh. 3, 33. 1. Ioh. 1, 5.

Q. Who have at any time upon their own experience proved them so to be?

A. Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all
your hearts, and in all your souls, that not one thing has failed, of all the
good things which the Lord your GOD spoke concerning you; all things are come
to pass unto you, not one thing has failed thereof: (Ios. 23, 14.21.45.) For
it came to pass, at the end of four hundred and thirty years, as was
promised: (Genesis 15, 14.) even the selfsame day, it came to pass, that all
the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt: (Exodus 12, 41.) unto
whom the LORD gave all the Land which he swear to give to their Fathers, and
they possessed it, and they dwelt therein. And the LORD gave them rest round
about, ac^^rding to all that he swear unto their ^athers, and there stood not
a man of all their enemies before them. There failed ^ot ought of any good
thing, which the LORD has spoken unto the house of ISRAHL; all came to pass:
(Josh. 21, 43.) So that he has dealt well with his servants, according to his
Word: (Psalm. 119.63.) And all his counsels of old are faithfulness, and truth:
Isa. 25, 1. 1 King. 8, 20. 2 Chronicles. 6, 15.

Q. What then, may this truth of GOD in promising teach us?

A. 1 To believe: for if we receive the witness of men: the witness of GOD
is greater. For this is the witness of GOD, which he has testified of his
Son: (1, Ioh. 5, 9.) Wherefore sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe GOD;
thus it shall be, even as it was told me: (Act. 27 25.) For shall mortal man
be more just than GOD? And shall a man be more pure than his Maker? Job, 4,
17. Romans 3, 3, 4. Luke 11.13.

2 To say, Lord GOD of Israel, there is no GOD like thee in Heaven above, or on
Earth beneath, who keeps Covenant, and mercy with thy servants, that walk
before thee, with all their hearts: (1, King. 8, 23.) Wherefore blessed be the
LORD, which spoke with his mouth unto DAVID my Father, and has with his hand
fulfilled it: 1. King. 8.15.20.

3 To Pray, saying; Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou have
caused me to trust: Psalm. 119.49.

4 Thou also shall keep my covenant therefore; thou, and thy seed after thee,
in their generations: (Genesis 17, 9.) As well as the Jews, who did according to
their promise. Else, as the Prophet shook his lap, and said: so GOD shall
shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performs not
his promise; even thus be he shaken out and emptied, unto which say, Amen:
Nehem. 5, 13.

5 For which and also say; Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art ^e
GOD of my salvation: Psalm. 25, 5.

Ob. I do now acknowledge GOD to ^ee true of his Word; but was he not ^ooued
to make these promises for ^ame thing of special worth he see to ^e in us
deserving the same?

A. Were ye not as the Ethiopians unto ^e, O children of Israel, says the
LORD? (Amos, 9.7.) For even TERAH the Father of ABRAHAM, and the Father ^f
NACHOR, they served other Gods: (Josh. 24.2.) So has the LORD also called
thee, being a Woman forsaken, and afflicted in spirit, and as a young wife when
thou wast refused, says thy GOD. (Isa. 54 6) And when he passed by thee, and
saw thee polluted in thy own blood, he said unto thee, when thou wast in thy
blood, live. Yea, he said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, live: Ezekiel.
16.6. Isa. 51.1.2. Hos. 14.4.

Ob. Though he did find us wicked, yet does he not leave us so; and therefore
for some foreseen good, that would be in us, he might be moved hereunto.

A. Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable
unto himself? Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or
is it gain to him that thou make thy ways perfect? (Job. 22, 2.) Look unto
the Heavens, and see, and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. If thou
sinnest, what do thou against him? Or if thy transgressions be multiplied,
what do thou unto him? If thou be righteous, what give thou him? Or what
receives he of thine hand? Job, 35, 5. Psalm. 16, 2.

Which of you having a Servant Plowing or feeding Cattle; will say unto him
by, and by; when he is come from the field; Go and sit down to meat? And
will not rather say unto him, make ready, wherewith I may sup, and gird thy
self, and serve me, till I have eaten, and drunken; and afterward thou shall
eat, and drink. Does he thank that servant, because he did these things
that were commanded him? I trow not. So likewise ye, when ye shall have done
all these things, which are commanded you, say; We are unprofitable servants;
we have done but that which is our duty to do: Luke 17 7.

Q. What was it then, which moved the LORD thus liberally to deal with us?

A. Because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the Oath which he
swear unto your fathers: (Deuteronomy. 7, 8, 9, 6.) Herein is love, not that we loved
GOD, but that he loved us: (1, Ioh. 4, 10.) And we love him because he loved
us first: (1 Ioh. 4 19.) For was not ESAV JACOBS brother, says the LORD? Yet I
have loved JACOB: (M^l 1, 2.) For the Children being not yet borne neither
having done good, or evil: that the purpose of GOD, according to the Election
might stand; not of Works, but of him that calls* it was said unto her, The
elder shall serve the younger, as it is written: Romans 9.11.

So then it is not of him that wills nor of him that runs, but of God that
shows mercy: (Romans 9 15.) And so Mercy and Truth are met together: Psalm. 85,
10. Exodus 33, 19. Ier. 31, 3. Romans 11, 32. Iam. 5, 15. Ps^^. 25.11.

Ob. But why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will? Romans 9.19.

A. Nay, but O man who art thou that replyest against God? Shall the thing
formed say to him that formed it, why have thou made me thus? Has not the
Potter power over the clay; of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honor,
and another to dishonor? (Romans 9, 20.) Woe unto him that ^hu^ striveth with
his Maker; let the Potsherd strive with the Potsherds of the earth, etc. Woe be
unto him that says to his Father, what begettest thou? Or to the woman, what
have thou brought forth? (Isa. 45, 9) And is it not then lawful for me to do
as I will with mine own? Math. 20, 15.

Ob. ^he branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in? Romans 11, 19.

A. Well; because of unbelief, they were broken off and thou stand by
faith; be not high minded, but fear. For if God spared not the natural
branches, take heed least he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the
goodness, and severity of GOD; on them that fell severity but toward thee
goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise, thou also shall be cut
off. And they also if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in;
for God is able to graffe them in again: (Romans 11.20.) Boast not therefore
against the branches; but if thou boast thou bear not the root, but the
root thee: Romans 11, 18.

Q. Why? what is the reason of this free, and undeserved mercy of GOD?

A. 1 That no flesh should glory in his presence but according as it is
written; let him that glories, glory in the Lord: 1, Cor. 1, ^9, ^1.

2 That ye might learn not to think of men, abo^e that which is written;
that none of you be puffed up, for one against another: 1, Cor. 4, 6.

Q. What may this free mercy of God teach us?

A. To say, O the depth of the Riches, both of the wisdom, and knowledge of
GOD! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out? For
who has known the mind of the LORD? Or who has been his Counselor? Or who
has first g^ven to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? Rom 11,
33.

2 To say, not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name be given the
glory: (Psalm. 115, 1.) F^r as for me, I am not worthy of the least of all thy
mercies, and of all the truth which, he has showed unto his Servant: (Genesis
32, 10.) For off him, and through him, and for him are all things; to him
therefore be glory for ever, and ever, Amen. Romans 11, 36 1. Cor. 4, 7.

3 I beseech you Brethren by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a
living Sacrifice Holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
Service, (Romans 12, 1.) And sow to your selves in Righteousness, and reap in
mercy: H ^. 10, 12.

4 Pray, saying; Remember me O my GOD concerning my good deeds, and spare me
according to the greatness of thy mercy. (Neh. 13, 14, 22.) Crying, Grace,
Grace unto it: Zach. 4 7.

Q. Are these blessings common unto all degrees of men?

A. Will he regard your persons, says the LORD of Hosts: (Mal. 1, 9.) He
will bless them that fear the LORD both small and great: (Psalm. 115, 13.)
Neither is there respect of persons with him: (Ephesians. 6, 9.) For he that is
called in the LORD, being a Servant, is the LORDS free man: 1, Cor. 7, 22. 1,
Tim. 2, 4.

Q. Are not these b^^ssings peculiar unto the nation of the Jews?

A. In thy seed (says GOD to ABRAHAM) shall all the Nations of the earth be
blessed: (Genesis 26, 4.) Is he the GOD of the Jews only, and not of the
Gentiles also? (Reu. 3, 29.) There is no difference, betwixt the Jew, and the
Greek; for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him R^m. 10,
12. John, 11, 51. Z^ch. 6, 15, 8, 23. Isay, 60.4.5, 9.10. verses, 60, 22.11,
10.42, 6, 45, 23 49, 6. Genesis 12, 3. Acts, 10, 15.28.28.28.11.20.15.11.14 21.14
27. Mat. 12, 21. Ioh. 10.16.12, 32.

Ob. But does not PAVL say, that unto the Israelites pertains the promises?

A. True, and therefore it was necessary, that the word of God should first
be spoken unto them; but they put it from them, and thereby judi^^^^
themselves unworthy thereof, we turned to the Gentiles. For so has the Lord
commanded us, saying. I have made thee a light of the Gentiles that thou
should be for Salvation unto the ends of the earth: Act ^3, 46.

And God which knows the hearts, bear witness to the Gentiles, giving them
the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto the Jews; putting no difference, between
us and them, after that by faith he had purified their hearts: (Acts, 15.8.)
That the Gentiles should be fellow Heirs, and of the same body, and partakers
of his promise in CHRIST by the Gospel: (Ephesians. 3, 6.) There is therefore
neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond, nor free; there is neither male,
nor female; for ye are all one in CHRIST JESUS: Gal. 3, 28. 1, Tim.
2.15.1.2.7. Romans 15.15. Math. 22.2.23.37. Acts. 14.2. Ioh. 1, 11. Isa, 65, 2.
Romans 10.21.

Ob. What advantage then has the Jew? Or what profit is there of Circumcision?

A. Much every way; chiefly because that unto them, were committed the Oracles
of God: Romans 3, 2.

Ob. We see, not only the Nation of the Jews, but many others of the Gentiles
also to be without the benefit of the Gospel.

A. This is because of their unbelief: (Romans 11.20.) For they will not receive
CHRIST: (Ioh. 1.11.) But are disobedient, and a gainsaying people: (Romans
10.21.) For as I live says the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of
the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live: (Ez^k. 33, 11.)
And I would have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the
truth: 1, Tim. 2, 4. Ioh. 1, 5.

Q. Whereunto may the generality of the promises be of use?

A. Let not the Son of the stranger that has joined himself to the LORD,
speak, saying, The Lord has utterly separated me from his people; neither let
the Eunuch say, behold I am a dry tree. For thus says the LORD, to the
Eu^^ches that k^epe my Sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and
take hold of my Covenant; even unto them will I give in mine House and within
my Walls a place, and a Name better than of Sons, and of Daughters, I will g
ue them an everlasting Name, that shall not be cut off (Isa. 62 2.) Sing O
barren, thou that did not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud:
thou that did not travail with Child, for more are the Children of the
Desolate, than the Children of the married wife says the LORD. Enlarge the
place of thy Tent, and let them stretch forth the Curtains of thine
habitations: spare not, lengthen thy Cords, and strengthen thy Stakes for thou
shall break forth on the right hand, and on the left, and thy seed shall
inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate Cities to be inhabited: Isay, 54,
1. 1, Corinth. 7, 21, 22. I^a. 45 22. Math. 22, 2. Tit. 2, 11. Heb. 1^.13.

Ob. Now of a truth I perceive, that GOD is no accepter of persons, but in
every Nation, he that fears him, and works Righteousness, shall be
accepted with with him: (Acts, 10, 34.) But will it not be very long betwixt
the promise, and the time of their accomplishment?

A. He which testifies these things, says, surely I come quickly: (Revel.
22.20.) And my reward is with me, to give every man acording as his work shall
be: Reu. 22, 12.

Ob. Long have I waited, and yet have not obtained?

A. Beloved be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the LORD as
a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The LORD is not slack
concerning his promise (as some men count slacknesse:) (2. Pet. 3.8.) And he
that believes shall not make have: (Isa. 28.16.) For the vision is yet for an
appointed time, but at the end it shall speak and not lie; though it tarry,
wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry: (Hab. 2.3.) For so
ABRAHAM after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise (Heb. 6.15.)
Amen, even so come LORD JESUS. (Reu. 22.20.

Q. But may not GOD alter his mind?

A. The Counsel of the LORD stands for ever; the thoughts of his heart, unto
all generations: (Psalm. 33.11) With him is no variableness, nor shadow by
turning: (James, 1.17.) Concerning his testimonies I have known them of old,
that he has founded them for ever: (Psalm. 119.152.) The words which he has
commanded to a thousand generations. Which covenant he made with ABRAHAM, and
his oath unto ISAAC, and confirmed the same unto JACOB, for a law, and unto
ISRAEL for an everlasting Covenant: (Psalm. 105.8.) For th^^ says the Lord, If
ye can break my Covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that
there shall not be day, and n^ght, in their seasons; then may also my Covenant
be broken: (Ier. 33.20) I have sworn by my self; the word is gone out of my
mouth in righteousness, and shall not return: Isa. 45.23.46, 10. 2, Cor. 1,
18 Ierem. 4, 28. Hos. 13, 14. Numb. 23, 20. 1 Samuel 12.22. Haggai, 2, 6. Number.
18, 19. Psalm. 22, 6.105, 8. 117, 2.119, 90. 93, 5. Heb. 6, 17.

Ob. I have seen an end of all perfection? Psalm. 119, 96.

A. But his Commandment is exceeding large: (Psalm. 119, 96.) The strength of
ISRAEL will not lie, nor repent: (1, Sam. 15, 29.) When your Father, and Mother
forsake you, then the LORD will take you up: (Psalm. 27, 10.) For GOD is not as
Man, that he should lie; or the Son of man that he should repent: Number. 23
19.

Lift up your eyes to the Heavens, and look upon the Earth beneath: for the
heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a
garment, and they that dwell therein shall dye in like manner; but my Salvation
shall be for ever, and my Righteousness shall not be abolished: Isa. 51,
6.40, 8. 2, Sam. 7, 24. Math. 24.35.

Ob. Why? has not GOD cast away his ancient people the Jews?

A. GOD forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of ABRAHAM, of the
Tribe of BENJAMIN. God has not cast away his people, which he foreknew, etc.
But even at this present time also, there is a remnant according to the
election of Grace: Romans 11, 1, 5, 1.

For what if some did not believe? Shall their unbelief make the faith of GOD
without effect? (Rom, 3.3.) And have they stumbled that they should fall? ^od
forbid. But rather through their fall ^alvation is come to the Gentiles for to
^ovoke them to jealousy. Now if the ^ll of them be the riches of the World;
and the diminishing of them, the riches of ^he Gentiles; how much more their
ful^esse? (Romans 11, 11.) For afterward shall the Children of ISRAEL return,
and seek the LORD their GOD, and DAVID their King; and shall fear the Lord,
and his goodness, in the latter days: Hos. 3, 5. 2 Cor. 3, 15. Isa. 11, 12,
19, 24, 25 50, 1. Zach. 2, 12. Romans 11, 20, 26, 28. verses.

Ob. Though GOD should never alter with us, yet shall we by our sins, break
Covenant with him. Isa. 63, 10. Exodus 32, 33.

A. If you break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments, then will I
visit your transgression with the rod, and your iniquities with stripes;
nevertheless, my loving kindness, I will not utterly take from you, nor
suffer my faithfulness to fail. My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the
thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my Holiness, that I
will not lie unto David, His seed shall endure for ever, and his Throne as the
Sun before me. It shall be established for ever, as the Moon, and as a
faithful witness in Heaven: Psalm. 89, 30. 2, Sam. 7, 15. Numb. 23, 20.

Q. What are the reasons of this unchangeable dealing of God toward his people?

A. 1. He himself changes not: (Mal. 3, 6.) He is the first, and with the
last even the same: Isa. 41.4.

2 JESUS CHRIST also, the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever: Heb. 13, 8.

3 Whom he once loves, he loves unto the end: (Ioh. 13.1.) Who is the LORD
GOD of your Fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of I^aac, and the God of
Jacob; this is his name for ever, and this is his memorial, unto all
Generations: Exodus 3, 15. Isay, 49, 1.

4 The gifts and callings of GOD, are without repentance: Romans 11, 29.

Q. What would you infer upon this ^nchangeablenesse in GOD?

A. Say not thou, what is the cause that the former days were better than
these; for thou do not enquire w^sely concerning this: Eccl 7, 10.

2 Therefore my beloved brethren; be ye steadfast, immovable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord: for as much as you know, that your labor
is not in vain in the Lord: (1, Cor. 15, 58.) And turn ye not aside; for
then shall ye go after vain things, which cannot profit, nor deliver you;
for they are vain: 1, Sam. 12, 21.

Q. Why? Is God able to make his word good?

A, Behold, says GOD, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh; is there any thing
too hard for me? (Ier. 32, 27.) The Lord of Hosts has purposed, and who shall
disanull it? And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back? (Isa.
14 27.) The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of
Majesty; the voice of the Lord breaks the Cedars; yea, the Lord breaks the
Cedars of Lebanon, (Psalm. 29.4.) neither by arm, nor strength; but by my
Spirit, says the Lord of hosts: (Zach. 4, 6.) Yea whatsoever the Lord
pleased, that did he in Heaven, and in Earth, and in all deep places: Psalm.
135, 6.

And now behold, the Lords hand is not shortened, that in cannot save, neither
is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: (Isa. 59, 1.) And though it be
marveilous in the eyes of the remnant of his people, in these days; shall it
also be marveilous in my eyes, says the LORD of hosts? Zach. 8, 6. Genesis 18,
14. Isa. 40, 26, 48, 13, 50, 2, 3, 43, 13. 1 Ioh. 4, 4. Mark. 10, 27.

Q. What shall we then say to these things? Romans 8.31.

A. 1 Ascribe ye strength unto GOD, his excellency is over Israel, and his
strength is in the Clouds: Psalm. 68, 34.

2 Pray, saying; Thou O GOD, who command our Strength, streng^hen O God that
which thou have wrought for us: Psalm. 68, 28.

3 Because I know whatsoever GOD does it shall be for ever; nothing can be put
to it, nor any thing taken from it: (Eccles. 3, 14.) If GOD be for us, who can
be against us? (Romans 8 13.) Therefore against hope, believe in hope, not
staggering at the Promise, through unbelief, etc. But bring strong in the
Faith, let us give glory to GOD: being fully persuaded, that what he has
promised, he (...) able also to perform: R^m. 4, 18 20. Eccles. 3, 14. Psalm.
62, 10, ^1. Genesis 17, 1.

CHAP. L. The objects of the Promises.
Q. I Know now that GOD can do every thing: (Job 42, 2.) What therefore is
required at my hands, that all things also may be possible unto me?

A. As thou beleevest, so it shall be done unto thee: (Math. 8, 13.) And if
thou can believe, all things are possible, to him that believes: (Mark. 9,
23.) For whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our
learning; that we through Faith, and comfort of the Scriptures might have
hope: (Romans 15, 4.) And that the blessing of ABRAHAM, might come on the
Gentiles, through JESUS CHRIST; that we might receive the promise of the
Spirit, through Faith: (Gal. 3, 14.) So then they which he of Faith, are
blessed with faithful ABRAHAM: (Gal. 3.9.) For the Scripture has concluded
all under sin, that the promise by the Faith of JESUS CHRIST, might be given
to them that believe: (Gal. 3, 22) Blessed therefore, is he that believes,
for there shall be a performance of those things which were told him from the
LORD: Luke 1, 45. Habac. 2, 4. 1 Timothy 4, 10. Psalm. 34, 8. Hebr. 11, 29. Ierem.
17, 5. Dan. 6, 23.

2 Hold the mystery of the Faith, in a pure Conscience: (1 Timothy 3.9.) For
bodily exercise profits little, but Godliness, is profitable unto all
things; having the Promises of the life that now is, and of that which is to
come: (1, Tim. 4.8.) He therefore that has clean hands, and a pure heart,
who has not lifted up his Soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully; he
shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the GOD of
his Salvation: (Psalm. 24, 4.) For the Lord GOD is a Son, and a shield, the
LORD will give Grace, and Glory, and no good thing will he withold from them
that walk uprightly: (Psalm. 84.11.) Know therefore that the LORD thy GOD, he
is God the faithful God which keeps, Covenant, and Mercy, with them that
love him, and keep his Commandments, to a thousand generations: (Deuteronomy. 7, 9.)
For the righteous LORD, loves Righteousness, his Countenance does behold the
upright: (Psalm. 11, 7.) And therefore, blessed are they which keep Judgment,
and he that does Righteousness at all times: Psalm. 106, 3. 119, 1. 73, 1.
Prou. 12, 28.16, 7.14, 27. Isa. 58, 13.56, 2. Deuteronomy. 7, 12. 1 King. 6, 12. Ioh.
13, 17. Exodus 39 43. Psalm. 4, 3.

Ob. I have long lived in want notwithstanding all my care, and endeavor in
the study, and practice of Godliness: Job, 35, 3.

A. But are there not with you, even with you, sins against the Lord your
God? (2, Chro. 28, 10) For GOD is good, and does good: (Psalm. 119, 68.) And
withdraws not his eyes from the Righteous: I^b, 36, 7. Psalm. 125, 4.

O thou therefore that art named the house of JACOB, is the spirit of the Lord
straightened? Are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walks
uprightly, says the Lord? (Micha, 2, 7) All the paths of the Lord, are Mercy,
and Truth unto such as keep h^s Commandments, and his testimonies: Psalm 25,
10.

To the pure all things are pure* but unto them that are defiled is nothing
pure: (Titus, 1, 15.) For the hand of our GOD is upon all them for good that
seek him; but his power; and his wrath, is against them that forsake him:
Ezra, 8, 22. 2 Chronicles. 19, 11.

Q. What use then are we to make hereof?

A. 1 Take heed therefore brethren, least there be in any of you, an evil
heart, of unbelief, in departing from the living GOD: (Heb. 3.12.) For to whom
swear he that they should not enter into his rest; but to them that believed
not? So we see then, that they could not enter in, because of unbelief: (Heb.
3, 18.) Let us therefore fear, least a promise being left us of entering into
his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it: (Heb. 4, 1.) For he
that comes to GOD, must believe that GOD is; and that he is a rewarder of
them, that diligently seek him: (Heb. 11, 6.) Here me therefore, O IVDAH, and
ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; believe in the Lord your GOD, so shall ye be
established; believe his Prophets, so shall ye prosper: (2, Chron. 20, 20.)
For these things are written, that ye might believe that JESUS is CHRIST the
Son of GOD; and in believing, ye might have life through him: Io^. 20.3^.

Now the GOD of hope fill you with all joy, and peace in believing, that ye
may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost: Romans 15, 13.

2 Having therefore these Promises, (dearly beloved) let us cleanse our
selves, from all filthiness of the Flesh, and Spirit; perfecting holiness, in
the fear of GOD: (2, Corinth. 7.1.) And be not conformed to this World; but
be ye transformed, by the renewing of your mind; that ye may prove, what is
that good, that acceptable, and perfect will of GOD: (Romans 12, 2.) And he that
will love Life, and see good days: let him refrain his tongue from evil, and
his lips that they speak no guile. Let him eschew evil, and do good, let
him seek peace, and pursue it: (1, Pet. 3, 10.) For this is a faithful
saying, and these things I will, that thou affirm constantly, that they which
have believed in GOD, might be careful to maintain good Works; for these
things are good, and profitable unto Men: (Titus, 3, 8.) Observe therefore, and
hear all these things, which I command thee, that it may be well with thee,
and with thy Children after thee for ever; when thou do that which is good,
and right in the sight of the Lord thy GOD: Deuteronomy. 12, 28.6, 17, 18, 4, 39, 40.
10, 12, 13. Josh. 3, 5.

Therefore give diligence, to add to your Faith, virtue; and to Virtue,
knowledge; and to Knowledge, temperance; and to Temperance, patience and to
Patience, godliness; and to Godl^nesse, brotherly kindness; and to Brotherly
kindness, Charity: (2. Pet. 1, 5.) And let us hear the conclusion of the
whole matter; fear GOD, and keep his Commandments; for this is the whole
duty of Man: (Eccles. 12, 1^.) Which if ye do, ye shall never fall: 2, Pet
1.10.

Now if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you, this day whom
ye will serve etc. But as for me, and my house we will serve the LORD: I^sh.
24 1^.) For all people every one w^ll walk in the name of his GOD, and we
will walk in the name of the Lord our GOD, for ever, and ever: M^cha, 4, 5.

O house of JACOB, come ye also, and walk in the light of the Lord: (Isa. 2,
5.) Provoking one another unto Love, and good Works: (Heb. 10, 24) And
exhorting one another daily, while it is called to day: Heb. 3, 13.

CHAP. LI. Of the Wicked, and of their Reward.
Q MAy it be expected that all should be moved by these promises, unto the
exercise of faith, and, new obedience?

A. Nothing less; for there are some who walk after their own ungodly Lusts;
these be they, who separate themselves sensual, having not the Spirit: (Iud.
18.) Of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they
are Enemies to the Cross of CHRIST: (Phil. 3, 18.) For as they that are after
the spirit, do mind the things of the Spirit; so these being after the flesh,
the things of the flesh. Because their carnal mind, is enmity against GOD;
for it is not subject to the Law of GOD, neither indeed can be: (Romans 8, 5.7.)
But are wicked and sinners before the Lord: (Genesis 13, 13.) Rebelling against
the Commandment of the LORD their GOD, not believing, nor hearkening to his
voice: (Deuteronomy. 9, 23.) They are corrupt, and have done abominable works: (Psalm.
14, 1.) I have called them transgressors, from the womb: (Isa. 48.8.) A
perverse and crooked generation: (Deuteronomy. 32, 5.20.) Their vine is of the vine of
Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorah; their grapes are the grapes of gall,
their clusters are bitter: their wine is the poison of Dragons, and the cruel
venom of Aspes: Deuteronomy. 32, 32.

Behold their sin is come before me: (Iona. 1, 2.) And I am pressed under
them, as a Cart is pressed that is full of sheaues: (Amos, 2, 13.) And their
sins are written with a pen of Iron, and with the point of a Diamond; and it
is graven upon the tables of their hearts, and upon the horns of their Altars:
(Ier. 17, 1.) They have a whorish forehead; they will not be ashamed: (Ier. 3,
3.) But are obstinate, and their neck is an iron sinew, and their brow brass:
(Isa. 48, 4.) For they have sold themselves to work wickedness in the sight
of the LORD: (1, King. 21, 20.) GOD is not in all their thoughts: Psalm. 10.4.

And though I earnestly protested unto their Fathers, rising early, and
protesting saying; Obey my voice; yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear;
but walked, every one in the imagination of their own evil heart: Ier. 11, 7.
Ezekiel. 16.49. Ier. 44.9, 16, 11. Genesis 38.7. Exodus 5, 2.14.11.15.24.16, 3,
17.2.32.7. Judge. 2.11. Psalm. 53.2.78.10. Prou. 21.10. Hos. 10, 4.

Q. Is there no reward for such men as these from God?

A. Is not destruction to the wicked, and a strange punishment to the workers
of iniquity? (Job. 31, 3.) The great God, that formed all things, both
rewards the fool, and rewards the transgressors: (Prou. 26, 10.)
According to his ways, and according to his doings will he recompense him:
(Hos. 12, 2.) The transgressors shall be destroyed together, and the end of
the wicked shall be cut off: (Psalm. 37.38.) GOD shall rain snares fire, and
brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their Cup:
(Psalm. 11, 6.) And the heritage appointed unto them by God: (Job. 20 ^9.) For
is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures says
the Lord? (Deu. 32, 34.) Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow
wickedness, reap the same: (Job. 4.8.) Trouble and anguish shall make them
afraid; they shall prevail against them, as a King ready to the battle: (Job.
15.24.) And I will feed them with wormwood, and give them water of gall to
drink: (Ier. 9.15.) Yea, I will bring such evil upon them, that whosoever
hears of it, both his ears shall tingle: (2, King. 21, 11.) And if they will
not for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish them seven times more for
their sins: (Leu. 26, 18.) And if they walk contrary unto me, and will not
hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon them, according to
their sins, etc. And if they will not be reformed by these things, but will
walk contrary to me, then will I also walk ^^ntrary to them, and will yet
punish them ^ven times more for their sins: Leu. ^6, 21.) Terrors shall take
hold of them (...) waters; a tempest steals them away as (...) the night:
(Job. 27, 20.) And hey shall ^e no more, and though they be sought for, ^et
shall they never be found, says the Lord God: Ezekiel. 26, 21. Isa. 9, 18.1, 25.
Deu^. 32, 22.28, 16.19, 20. Zeph. 1, 14. Ezekiel. 24, 10. Pro. 22, 8 Hos. 7, 13, 9
9. Ier. 6, 11.15. 2.22.8.23.10.48.13.15.5. 1 Samuel 2, 10, Job. 4, 20.18.11. Isa.
^4 17. Amos, 5, 18.8 3. Nahum, 1, 9. Ezekiel. 21.6. Deuteronomy. 28.20. Joel. 2.26. Amos.
5.24. Psalm. 68.21.

Behold therefore, I set before you this day a blessing, and a curse: a
blessing if ye obey the Commandments of the LORD your GOD; which I command
you this day; and a curse if ye will not obey the Commandment of the Lord
your GOD; but turn aside out of the way, which I command you this day, to go
after other Gods, which ye have not known: Deuteronomy. 11.26, 30.15.

Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? Prudent, and he shall know
them? For the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them;
but the transgressors shall fall therein: Hos. 14.9. 1, Cor. 10, 6. Prou.
10.6, 19.16, 12. 2, 3.12, 7, 13.6, 21, 12, 12, 21, ver. Psalm. 32, 10.

Ob. Whatsoever you Ministers say, I am become rich, I have found me out
substance in all my labors: (Hos. 12.8.) Neither shall evil come upon me. And
therefore the Prophets shall become wind, and the Word is not in them: Ier. 5,
13.

A. Because sentence against an evil work is not speedily executed, therefore
the heart of the Sons of men, is fully set in them to do evil: (Eccl.
8.11.) The Storke in the Heavens knows her appointed times and the Turtle,
and the Crane, and the Swallow, observe the times of their coming, but this
people know not the judgments of the LORD: (Ier. 8.7.) They will not behold his
high hand; but they shall see it, and be confounded: Isa. 26, 11.

The LORD indeed is flow to anger; but he is great in power, and will not
surely ^leere the wicked: (Nah. 1, 3.) For will a Fowler take up the snare from
the Earth, and have taken nothing at all? (Amos, 3, ^,) Your fathers where are
they? And the Prophets do they live for ever? But my words, and my statutes
which I commanded my Servants the Prophets did they not take hold of your
Fathers? And they returned, and said; like as the Lord of Hosts thought to do
unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so has he dealt
with us: (Zach. 1, 5.) And despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and
forbearance, and long suffering, not knowing that the goodness of GOD, leads
thee to Repentance? But after thy hardness, and impenitent heart, that cannot
repent, treasurest up to thy self wrath, against the day of wrath, and
Revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD: Romans, 2, 4.

Take heed therefore, least there should be among you, a Root that bears
gall and wormwood. And it comes to pass when he hears the words of this
curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying; I shall have peace,
though I walk in the imagination of mine heart; to add drunkenness to
thirst; the Lord will not spare him; but then the anger of the Lord, and his
jealousy, shall smoke against that man: and all the curses that are written
in this book, shall lie vp^n him: and the LORD shall blot out his name from
under Heaven: Deuteronomy. 29.18. Isa. 47, 7.57.11. Ezekiel. 21.9. Amos 6 3 9.10. Psalm.
50.18. Josh. 23, 15. Zeph. 2, 15.1.12. Isa. 28.17. Zach. 1, 15.

Happy therefore is the man that fears always; but he that hardneth his heart,
shall fall into mischief: (Prou. 28.14.) The wise man's eyes are in his head:
but the fool walks in darkness: (Eccl. 2, 14.) The prudent man foreseeth
the evil, and hides himself but the wicked pass on and are punished: (Prou.
27, 12.) A wise man fears, and departs from evil: but the fool rages and
is confident: Prou 14.16.22, 3.

CHAP. LII. The Wicked Convinced of sin.
Ob. THese Judgments may befall Heathens, and such as are without; but we are
the people of GOD, with whom the Lord has made a Covenant of Peace; and
therefore none of these things shall befall us.

A. The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will
be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you: (2, Chron.
15.2.) For at what instant I shall speak concerning a Nation, and concerning a
Kingdom, to build, and to plant it; if it do evil in my sight, that it obey
not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit
them: (Ier. 18, 9.) And the punishment of the iniquity of the Daughter of my
people, is greater, than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was
overthrown in a moment: Lam. 4, 6.

Wherefore trust ye not in lying words, saying; The Temple of the LORD, the
Temple of the LORD, the Temple of the LORD, are these: (Ier. 7.4.) But go ye
now unto my place which was in Shilo, where I set my name at the beginning, and
behold what I did to it, for the wickedness of my people Israel: (Ier. 7,12.)
For so will I make this House like Shilo, and make this City a curse to all
Nations of the Earth: Ier. 26.6. 1. King. 9.6. Exodus 32, 35. Isa. 57.3.4.
Deutr. 8.19.

Ob. We do not only live in the Church, but by Baptism are made members of
the same?

A. Baptism, verily profits, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a
breaker of the Law, thy Baptism^ is made no Baptism: (Romans 2, 25.)
Circumcision is nothing; and Uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the
Commandments of GOD: 1, Cor. 7, 19.

It is (...) that Egypt, and Judah, and Edome, and the Children of Ammon, and
Moab, even all these Nations are uncircumcised, and thou art uncircumcised in
heart: (Ier. 9.25.) And therefore thou shall die the deaths of the
uncircumcised, by the hand of the strangers; for I have spoken it, says the
LORD GOD: Ezekiel. 28, 10. 1, Cor. 10.1.

Ob. I have not only bin entered, and enrolled a member of the Church, but also
have joined with others in the worship of GOD, and in the profession of the
same: Judge. 17.3. Isa 58.3.

A. There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not
washed from their filthiness: (Prou. 30.12.) Has the Lord as great delight in
burnt offerings and Sacrifices, as in obeying his voice? Behold to obey is
better than Sacrifice, and to hearken, than the fat of Rams: (1, Sam. 15.22.)
The Sacrifices of the wicked is abomination to the Lord; but the Prayer of the
upright is his delight: Prou. 15. 8.21.27. Iam. 1.27.

But unto the wicked says God; what have thou to do to declare my Statutes,
or that thou should take my Covenant within thy mouth? Seeing thou hate
instruction, and castest my words behind thee: (Psalm. 50, 16.) For the LORD
loves Judgment, and hates Robbery for burnt offerings: (Isa. 61, 8)
Wherefore let no man deceive you, he that does righteousness is righteous, as
he is righteous; but he that commits sin is of the Devil: 1, Ioh. 3, 7.
Hag. 2, 11, 12. Isa. 29 1.58.4, 66, 3, 1, 11. Amos, 2, 8.5, 25, 21. Leu. 26,
31. Z^ch. 7, 5 Mal, 1, 7, 1, 13. Ier. 6.20, 7, 22, 14.12. Psalm. 50, 9, 40 6.
Hos. 6, 6, 4, 19. Mark. 12, 33. Luke 11.41.

Ob. Blessed be thou of the LORD, for I have kept the Commandments of GOD, (1,
Sam. 15, 13.) Have done many things; (Mark 6, 20.) And have been zealous for
the Lord of Hosts. 2, Kin. 10.16, Hos. 12, 8.

A. What means then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing
of the Oxen which I hear? (1, Sam. 15.14.) For in thee have they set light by
Father, and Mother; in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with
the stranger; in ^hee have they vexed the Fatherless, and ^he Widow. Thou
have despised my Holy things, and have profaned my Sabbaths. In thee are Men
to carry tales to shed blood: in the midst of thee they commit Lewdness:
(Ezekiel. 22, 7.) Wherefore I have a few things against thee: (Revel. 2.20.) As
well as against ISRAEL, who feared the LORD, and made unto themselves, the
lowest of them Priests of the High Places. They feared GOD, the LORD, and
served their own Gods; they feared not the Lord: (2, King. 17, 32.) For the
fear of the LORD is to hate evil, as pride, and arrogance, and every ev^ll
way: (Prou. 8, 13.) And therefore, cursed art thou, if thou confirm not all
the words of this Law to do them; and all the people shall say, Amen: Deuteronomy.
27, 26, 4, 2.6.17.12.32.18.13. Iam. 1, 26, 2.10.3, 9, 10. Ezekiel. 18, 10. 2, Cor.
8, ^1. 2, King. 22.2.

Ob. I deny not, but do freely confess, Murder, and Adultery to be grievous
sins, deserving death; now then, if I can acquit my self of such sins, I
shall do well enough?

A. You have heard, that it was said to them of old time, Thou shall not kill;
and whosoever shall kill, shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say unto
you, that whosoever is angry with his brother, without a cause, shall be in
danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his Brother Racha, shall
be in danger of a Counsel; and whosoever shall say thou Fool, shall be in
danger of Hell fire. You have heard also, that it was said to them of old time,
Thou shall not commit Adultery. But I say unto you, that whosoever looks on a
woman to lust after her, has committed Adultery with her already in his heart:
(Math. 5, 21, 27. ver.) And for every idle word, that men shall speak, they
shall give an account thereof in the day of Judgment: Math. 12, 36. Ezekiel.
16.49. 1, Chron. 13.9.2.32.24. 1, Sam. 6.19. 1, King. 20 35. Numb. 20.12. Deuteronomy.
32.50.

Ob. What a precise^^^sse call you this? For what if now, and then I meeting
with a good fellow, or two, do make my self merry with them, and do follow
some other tricks of youth?

A. Woe be unto you that call evil good, and good evil that put darkness for
light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for
bitter: Isa. 5.20.

You are they which justify your selves before men; but GOD knows the
hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is abominable in the sight
of GOD: (Luke 16, 15.) The show of your Countenance does witness against you,
and you declare your sin as Sodom, and hide it not: woe unto you, for you
have rewarded evil unto your selves: Isa. 3.9. Ier. 6.15. 2.35. Prou.
14.12.16.25.

Ob. You are very rash in judging; for who but God knows the heart?

A. Does not the Ear try words? And the mouth taste his meat? (Job.
12.11.34.3.) Even a Child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure,
and whether it be right: (Prou. 20.11.) For does a Fountain send forth at the
same place sweet water, and bitter? Can a Fig Tree bear Olive berries?
Either a Vine, Figs? So can no Fountain yield salt water, and fresh: Iam. 3,
11. Luke 6, 43. Math. 12, 33, 7.16.

Ob. Notwithstanding your show of preciseness, if your faults were written in
your forehead, we should have much worse things to say of you.

A. Speak not evil one of another (Brethren) he that speaks evil of his
Brother, and judges his Brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges the
law: but if thou judge the Law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a Judge.
There is one Lawgiuer, who is able to save and to destroy, who art thou that
iudgest another? (Iam. 4, 11.) Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what
judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it
shall be measured to you again: Math. 7, 1.

Ob Thou seem to restrain wisdom to thy self; but what know thou that
we know not? Or what understand thou that is not in us? Job, 15, 8.15, 2.

A. If ye know these things, happy ^re ye if ye do them: (Ioh. 13, 17.)
Thy Father judged the cause of the poor, and needy, then it was well with him;
was ^ot this to know me, says the LORD? (Ier. 22, 16.) For behold the fear of
the LORD that is Wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding: (Job, 28,
28.) You profess you know him, but in Works you deny him, being abominable,
and unto every good work reprobate: Titus, 1, 16.

And how do ye say we are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? Ye have
rejected the Word of the Lord, nnd what wisdom is in you? Ier. 8, 8.5, 4. Iam.
3, 13. Prou. 3, 17. Luke 12, 47. Iam. 4, 16, 3, 17. Romans 2, 17. 1 Ioh. 2, 4.
Ioh. 15, 22, 9, 1. Prou. 26.12.26, 16.

CHAP. LIII. The wicked Convinced of judgment.
Ob. IT should seem this man has seen some vision, or has had some other
extraordinary revelation: Therefore watch man, what of the night? Watchman what
of the night? Isa. 21.11.

A. The watchman said; The morning comes, and also the night; (Isa. 21, 12.)
And are ye come to inquire of me? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not
be inquired of by you: (Ezekiel. 20, 3.) Beware ye despisers and wonder, and
perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise
believe, though a man declare it unto you: (Acts, 13, 40. Habac. 1, 5.) Now
therefore be not mockers, least your hands be made strong, for I have heard
from the LORD GOD of hosts, a consumption, even determined upon the whole
Earth. Give ye ear, and hear my voice, hearken and hear my speech: (Isa.
28, 22.) Then said I; Ah, LORD GOD, they say of me; Does he not speak
parables? Ezekiel. 2^ 49. 14, 7.

Ob. But when went the Spirit of the LORD, from our Ministers unto thee? (1.
King. 22, 24.) Who do say to us, ye shall not see the Sword, neither shall
ye have Famine; but the LORD will give you assured peace in this place: Ierem.
14, 13.23, 18, 18, 18.23, 17. 1, King. 18, 17.

A. AMEN, the LORD do so; the Lord perform the words that they have spoken:
(Ierem 28, 6.) As for me, I have not hastened from being a Pastor to follow
thee, neither have I desired the woeful day, thou know; that which came out
of my lips, was right before thee: Ier. 17, 16.

And as for your Ministers, if any of them think himself to be a Prophet,
and Spiritual, let him acknowledge, that the things that I write unto you, are
the Commandments of the LORD; but if any man be ignorant, let him be
ignorant: (1, Corinth. 14, 37.) But let no man deceive you with vain words;
for because of these shings, comes the wrath GOD, upon the Children of
disobedience: Ephesians. 5, 6.

Your Prophets, prophecy lies, in my Name, I sent them not, neither have I
commanded them, neither spoke unto them; they Prophesied unto you a false
vision, and divination, and a thing of naught, and the deceit of their heart.
Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the Prophets, that prophecy in my
Name, and I sent them not; yet they say, Sword, and Famine, shall not be in
this land; by sword, and famine shall those Prophets be consumed. And the
people to whom they Prophesied shall be cast out into the streets of
Jerusalem, because of the Famine, and the Sword, and they shall have none to
bury them; for I will power their wickedness upon them: (Ierem. 14, 14.) And
when the words of the Prophets shall come to pass, then shall you know, that
the LORD has truly sent him: Ierem. 28, 9.50, 30.31, 23, 19.23.25.23.30.28.15.
Ezekiel. 14, 9.13, 6.13, 22. Hosea, 4.9.9.7.8. Isa. 29.9.42.19. 1. King. 22,
23.25. Isa. 3, 12.

Ob. I think you will never give over these threatening words, give me such a
Minister, as will preach comfortable things unto us.

A. Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the Truth? Gal. 4, 16.

As for these Ministers, they have healed your hurt with sweet words, saying;
Peace, peace, when there is no peace. (Ierem. 8.11.) And if a man walking in
the spirit, and falsehood, and do lie, saying; I will Prophecy unto thee of
wine and strong drink; he shall be even the Prophet of this people: Micha,
2, 11.

Therefore shall thou fall in the day, and the Prophet also shall fall with
thee in the night, and I will destroy thy Mother: Hos. 4, 5. 1 King. 18, 18.
Isa. 30.8. Hos. 4 4.

Ob. Though these Judgments you threaten, be certain, yet they may not be
near; (Ezekiel. 11, 3.) But the vision, may be for many days to come, and you
Prophecy of the times that are far off: Ez^k. 12, 27.

A. Who is like me? And who will appoint me the time, says the LORD? (Ierem.
49, 19.) Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be
prolonged any more; but the word which I have spoken, shall be done, says the
Lord GOD: (Ezekiel. 12, 28) Yea, eue^ in your days, O rebellious house will I say
the thing, and will perform it: (Ez^k. 12, 25.) He shall come as an Eagle to
the house of the LORD: (Hos, 8, 1.) And he will be a swift witness against
such scorners: (Malac. 3, 5.) For the days of visitations are come, the days
of recompense are come: (Hosea, 9, 7.) It shall be in a moment, even suddenly,
(Isa. 29.5) as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose
breaking comes suddenly, at an instant: (Isa. 30, 13.) For no man knows his
time; but as the Fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that
are caught in the snare; so are the sons of Men snared in an evil time, when
it falls suddenly upon them: Eccles. 9.12. Amos, 9, 10, 8, 1, 2. Zeph. 1, 14.
Deuteronomy. 32, 35. Isa. 47, 11. Ierem. 1, 12.48, 16.50.31.51.33. Lam. 4, 18.22.
Ezekiel. 7, 12, 21.9. Hos. 4.19. Joel, 2, 1. Genesis 19, 24. Dan. 5, 3, 30.

Ob. If the worst things do fall, yet have I many means, to guard, and to
defend me from the same.

A. O inhabitant of Lebanon, that make thy nest in the Cedars how gracious
shall thou be, when Pangs come upon thee, as the pain of a woman in travel?
(Ierem, 22.23.) The pride of thine heart has deceived thee, thou that dwell
in the clefts of the Rock, whose habitation is high; that says in his heart,
who shall bring me down to the ground? Though thou exaltest thy self as the
Eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the Stars, thence will I bring thee
down, says the LORD: (Obad. 3, 4.) Your silver, and your gold shall not be
able to deliver you in the day of the wrath of the LORD: (Ezekiel. 7, 19.) The
Lord is wise in heart, and mighty in strength; who has hardened himself
against him, and prospered? Job, 9, 4. Prou. 10.2.11.4. Ezekiel. 28.4, 7, 19.
Zeph. 1.18. Zach. 9.3. Ier. 49.4. 4.30. Hab. 2.9.

Ob. If our own power be too weak, we have multitudes of allies, and many
good friends will stand by, and succor us?

A. EPHRAIM is fed with the Wind, and follows after the East Wind: (Hos.
12.1.) For though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: Prou.
16, 5.

And how say ye then, we are mighty, and have strong men for the War? (Ier.
48, 14.) Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the Rivers,
that had the waters round about it, whose Rampart was the Sea, and her Wall was
from the Sea? Nahum, 3, 8.

Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity, ye have eaten the
fruit of lies; for because thou did trust in the multitude of thy mighty men;
therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy Fortresses shall
be spoiled: (Hos. 10.13.) When also thy lovers will despise thee, and will
seek thy life: (I^r. 4.30.) Your hired men shall be turned back, and fly
away together: (Ier. 46.21.) And the multitude of thy strangers shall be like
the small dust, and the multitude of thy terrible ones, shall be as the
Chafe, that passes away, (Isa. ^9, 5.) And you shall be ashamed of a people,
that could not profit you; nor be an help, nor profit, but a shame, and also
a reproach. For they shall help in vain, and to no purpose^ therefore have I
cried concerning this their strength is to sit still: (Isa. 30 5, 7.

Wherefore cease ye from Man, whose breath is in his nosthrels; for wherein is
he to be accounted of? Isa. 2.22. 1, Cor. 10.22. Isa. 8.6.57.13. Job. 36.19,
15.31. 2, Samuel, 16, 23.2, 17.14. Ier. 18.^.

Ob. If we cannot with safety stand out against these Judgments, we will
then fly from them, and they shall not overtake us: Isaiah, 30.16.

A. Am I a GOD at hand, says the LORD, and not a GOD a far off? (Ier.
23.23.) Whether will ye go from his spirit? Or whether will ye flee from his
presence: Psalm, 139.7.

He which flees of you, shall not flee away; and he that escapes of you,
shall not be delivered: (Amos, 9, 1.) But it shall be with you, as if a man
did fly from a Lion and a Bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned
his hand on the wall, and a Serpent bit him: Amos, 5, 19. Isa. 30.16. Amos 2,
14.

Ob. If we cannot escape by flying, we will then hide our selves in some dark
Corner of the earth: Job. 22, 12, 13. Psalm. 94.7, Isa. 29, 15.

A. I know Ephraim, says GOD, and Israel is not hid from me: (Hos. 5, 3.)
Neither is there any creature which is not manifest in his sight; but all
things are naked, and open unto the eyes of him, with whom we have to do:
(Heb. 4.13.) Whereby it shall come to pass, that though you die into Hell,
thence shall my hand take you; though you climb up to Heaven, thence will I
bring you down, and though you hide your selves in the top of CARMEL, I will
search, and take you out thence: and though you be hid from my sight in the
bottom of the Sea, thence will I command the Serpent, and he shall bite you:
Amos. 9.2. Hos. 7, 2. Zach. 4. 10. Job. 12.22.

Ob. If this be our case, we will then cease from open sinning against GOD;
and what we do, we will do in such sort as no eye shall see us?

A. Woe unto you, that seek deep to hide your Counsel from the LORD, and
your works are in the dark, and you say who sees us? And who knows us?
Surely your turning of things vpside down, shall be esteemed as the Potters
clay: For shall the work say of him that made it, he made me not? Or shall
the thing framed say of him that framed it; he had no understanding? Isay,
29.15.

You take Counsel, but not of me; and you cover with a covering, but not of my
spirit, that you may add sin to sin: (Isa. 30, 1.) But the spirit of man,
is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly: (Prou.
20.27.) And his eyes behold his eyelids try the Children of men: (Psalm. 11.4.)
To give every Man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his
doings: Ierem. 17, 10. Psalm, 139.2, etc.

Ob. But will not a gift in the hand, pacify Gods wrath?

A. The LORD your GOD, is the GOD of Gods, and LORD of Lords, a great GOD; a
mighty and a terrible; which regards not persons, nor takes rewards: (Deuteronomy.
10, 17.) For every Beast of the Forest is his, and the Cattle upon a thousand
Hills. He knows all the Fowls of the Mountains, and the wild Beasts of the
Field are his. If he were hungry he would not tell thee; for the world is his,
and the fullness thereof: Psalm. 50.10

Wherefore then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians, and PHARAOH
hardened their hearts: (1, Sam. 6, 6.) For because there is wrath, beware least
he take you away with his stroke; then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
Will he esteem thy riches? No not Gold, nor all the Forces of strength: Job.
36, 18.

Ob. Whatsoever you can say, I know that GODS mercies, do surpass the measure
of our sins, and he that made us, will save us.

A. He that made you will not have mercy on you, and he that formed you will
show you no favor: (Isa. 27.11.) But it shall come to pass, when you hear
the words of this curse, and you bless your selves in your heart, saying; We
shall have peace, though we walk in the imagination of our hearts, to add
Drunkenness to thirst; the LORD will not spare you, but then the anger of the
LORD, and his jealousy shall smoke against you, and all the curses that are
written in this book, shall lie upon you, and the Lord shall blot out your
Name from under Heaven. Deuteronomy. 29.19.

Ob. I know that God is not so much without pity, but that if when trouble
comes, we do cry unto him, he will hear, and have Mercy upon us.

A. You shall then cry unto the LORD indeed, but he will not hear you; he
will even hide his face from you at that time, as you have behaved your selves
ill in your doings: (Micha, 3, 4.) And he will say unto you, go, and cry unto
your GODS which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in time of your
Tribulation: Judges, 10, 14.

Not that the LORDS hand is shortened, that it cannot save, neither his ear
heavy that it cannot hear. But your iniquities have separated between you,
and your GOD, and your sins, have hid his face from you, that he will not
hear. For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity;
your lips have spoken lies, your tongue has muttered perverseness: Isay, 59,
1.

Wherefore behold, he will bring evil upon you, which you shall not be able to
escape, and though you cry unto him, yet he will not hearken unto you: Ier.
11.11. Hosea. 5.6. Judge. 11.7. Ier. 14.12.7.13.

Ob. If Mercy cannot be had for our own sakes, yet by the Prayers, of the
Righteous, and for their righteousness sake, we shall be delivered.

A. Though these three men NOAH, DANIEL, and JOB were in it, they should
deliver but there own souls, by their righteousness, says the LORD GOD:
(Ezekiel. 14.14) And though MOSES and SAMVEL stood before me, yet my mind could
not be toward this people; cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth:
Ierem. 15.1.

Therefore, they shall not pray for this people, nor lift up cry or prayer for
them, neither entreat me, for I will not hear them, says the LORD: Ierem.
7.16.14.11.11.14.15.5.16.5.

Ob. But will GOD destroy the righteous with the wicked? (Genes. 18.23.) Or
shall one man sin, and will he be wrath with all the Congregation? Numb.
16.22.

A. Did not ACHAN commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on
all the Congregation of ISRAEL? And he perished not alone in his Iniquity?
Josh. 22.20. 2. Chron. 28.19.

Notwithstanding run ye to and fro, through the streets of JERUSALEM, and
see now, and know; and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a
man; if there be any, that executes Judgment, that seeks the Truth, and I
will pardon it: Ier. 5, 1.

But from the least of you to the greatest of you, every one is given to
Covetousness; and from the Prophet even to the Priest, every one deals
falsely: (Jeremiah, 6, 13.) The good Man is perished out of the Earth, and
there is none upright among them; they all lie in wait for blood, they hunt
every man his Brother with a Net: that they may do evil with both hands,
earnestly. The Prince asks, and the Judge asks for a Reward; and the Great
man he utters his mischievous desires; so they wrap it up. The best of them
is as a Brier; the most upright is sharper than a thorn Hedge; therefore the
day of thy Watchmen, and thy Visitation comes, now shall be your
perplexity: Micha, 7, 2. Numbers, 16, 26. Ezekiel. 22.25.22.30.

Ob. If I may be sure to escape so long until some common Judgment come upon
our whole Land, I shall do well enough.

A. If thou continue thus presumptuously to sin, the LORD shall separate thee
unto evil, out of all the Tribes of ISRAEL, according to all the Curses of
this Covenant, that are written in this book of the Law: (D^uteronomie, 29,
21.) As well as he did ACHAN who for his sin, was by all ISRAEL stoned with
stones, and his goods with all that he had burned with fire: (Joshua, 7, 25.)
Woe therefore be unto thee, will thou not be made clean? When shall it once
be? Jeremiah, 13.27.

CHAP. LIIII. Of the Wicked Converted.
Q. IF our sin guiltiness deserve such inevitable Judgments, go thou
near, and hear all that the LORD our GOD shall say, and speak thou unto us,
all that the LORD our GOD shall speak unto thee, and we will hear it, and
do it: Deuteron. 5, 27.

A. The LORD has heard the voice of your words, and said unto me; I have
heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee;
they have well said, all that they have spoken. O that there were such an heart
in them, that they would fear me, and keep my Commandments always, that it
might be well with them, and with their Children for ever: Deuter. 5.28.

But ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God,
saying; Pray for us unto the LORD our GOD, and according to all that the LORD
our GOD shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it. And now I have this
day declared it unto you; but ye do not obey the voice of the LORD your GOD,
nor any thing, for the which he has sent me unto you. Now therefore know
certainly, that ye shall dye by the Sword, by the Famine, and by the
Pestilence; in the place whether ye desire to go, and to soiourne: (Ier. 42,
20.) For ye cannot serve the LORD; for he is an holy GOD; he is a jealous
God; he will not forg^^e your transgressions, and sins: Joshua, 24.19.

How long then halt ye between two opinions? If the LORD be GOD follow him;
but if BAAL, then follow him: (1, King. 18.21.) And hearken to me, ye men of
ENGLAND, that GOD also may hearken unto you: (Judge. 9.7.) Give glory to the
Lord your GOD, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon
the dark Mountains; while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow
of death, and make it gross darkness. But if ye will not hear it, my Soul
shall weep in secret places for your Pride, and mine eyes shall weep sore,
and run down with tears, because the LORDS Flock is carried away captive:
Ierem. 13, 16.

Q. We have indeed, besides all other Sins, dissembled with the LORD; but
now the Lord GOD of Gods, the Lord GOD of Gods he knows, (Josh. 22, 22.)
that him will we serve, and his voice will we obey: (Josh. 24.24.) The LORD
be a true, and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to
all things, for the which the LORD thy GOD shall send thee to us. Whether it
be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our GOD,
to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of
the Lord our GOD: Ierem. 42, 5. Josh. 24, 21, 24.

A. Then gird your loins, and lament, ye Priests, howl ye Ministers of the
Altar: come lie all night in Sackcloath, ye Ministers of my GOD, etc.
Sanctify ye a Fast, call a solemn Assembly, gather the Elders, and all the
inhabitants of the Land, into the house of the LORD your GOD, and cry unto the
LORD: Joel, 1, 13. Ier. 4.14, Zeph. 2, 1. Joel 2, 12, ^5. Iona, 3, 8. Joel, 1,
13. Psalm. 46, 8. Lam. 2, 14. Joel, 2, 17. Iam. 4, 8.

Saying, We acknowledge our wickedness, and the iniquities of our Fathers;
for we have sinned against thee: (Ierem. 14, 20.) We have sinned, and have
committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by
departing from thy precepts, and from thy Judgments. Neither have we
hearkened unto thy servants the Prophets, which spoke in thy Name, to our
Kings, our Princes, and our Fathers, and to all the people of the Land. O LORD,
righteousness belongs unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this
day; because of our trespass, that we have trespassed against thee: (Dan. 9,
5.) O our GOD, we are ashamed, and blush, to lift up our face to thee, our
GOD; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is
grown up unto the Heavens. And now, O our GOD, what shall we say after this?
For we have forsaken thy Commandments: Ezra, 9, 6, 10.

O LORD, we beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the Prayer of
thy servants, who desire to fear thy Name, and do confess our sins which
we have sinned against thee; both we and our fathers house have sinned (Nehe.
1.11.16.) And have gone astray like lost sheep; therefore seek thy servants,
for we will not forget thy Commandments: (Psalm. 119.176.) Turn us again, O
GOD of hosts, and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved: (Psalm. 80.7.)
Do thou incline our heart unto thee, to walk in thy ways, and to keep thy
Commandments, and thy statutes, and thy Judgments, which thou commandedst our
Fathers: (1. King. 8.58.) That which we see not teach thou us; if we have done
iniquity we will do no more: Job. 34, 32, 13, 23. Psalm, 80.18. Psalm,
143.8.

2 Do you take hold of his strength, that you may make peace with him, and you
shall make peace with him: (Isa. 27.5.) And thereby good shall come unto thee:
Job. 22.21.

And because no man comes unto the Father, but by CHRIST: (John, 14.6.) Nor
unto CHRIST, except the Father draw him: (John, 6, 44,) Therefore pray, saying;
Draw me, we will run after thee: Can. 1 4

3 Wash ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before
mine eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek Judgment, relieve the
oppressed, judge the Fatherless, plead for the Widow. Come now, and let us
reason together says the LORD; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall
be as white as snow; though they be red like Crimson, they shall be as
Wool. (Isa. 1.16.) Yet the LORD will wait that he may have mercy upon you, and
therefore will he be exalted, that he may have compassion upon you; for the
LORD is the GOD of Judgment: Isa. 30, 18. Hosea, 13.9. Ezekiel, 33, 11. Zach.
1.3.8.16. Ier. 18, 11. Mal. 3.7. Psalm. 4, 4. Eccl. 12.23. 1, King. 8, 61. Isa.
66, 1.2.

4 Being thus converted, you should enter into a Covenant with the LORD your
GOD, and into his oath, which the LORD your GOD shall make with you: so shall
he establish you this day for a people unto himself, and be unto you a God, as
he has said unto you, and as he has swore unto your Fathers: Deuteronomy. 29, 12.
Nehemiah, 9.38. 2, Chronicles, 15.12.23.3. 2, Chronicl. 29.10.34.31. Ezra. 10.3.

Q. Good is the word of the LORD which thou have spoken: (Isa. 39 8) We do
therefore enter into a Covenant, that we will be the Lords people: (2, Chron.
23.16.) And we, our Wives, our Sons, and our Daughters, even every one of
us, having knowledge and understanding, do here enter into a Curse, and into
an Oath to walk in GODS Law, which was given by MOSES, the Servant of GOD, and
to observe and do all the Commandments of the LORD our GOD, and his
Judgments, and his Statutes: (Neh. 10.28.) The Lord our God will we serve,
and his voice will we obey: Josh. 24.24. Nehem. 9.38.

A. Then have you delivered your selves, out of the hand of the Lord: (Josh.
23, 31.) And as you have avouched the LORD this day to be your GOD, and to
walk in his ways, and to keep his Statutes, and Commandments, and his
judgments, and to hearken unto his voice; so the LORD has avouched you this
day to be his peculiar people, as he has promised you, and that you should
keep all his Commandments, and to make you high above all Nations which he
has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor, and that ye may be an holy
people unto the ( LORD your GOD, as he has spoken: (Deuter. 26.17.) And these
very stones shall be a witness unto you; for they have heard all the words of
the LORD, which he has spoken unto you; they shall be a witness unto you,
least ye deny your GOD: I^sh. 24.27.

For this cause, we also will not cease to pray for you, and to desire that
ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all Wisdom, and
spiritual understanding: that ye may walk worthy of the LORD unto all
pleasing, being fruitful unto every good work, and increasing in the
knowledge of God: Col. 1, 9.

Now the GOD of peace that brought again from the dead, our LORD JESUS, that
great Shepherd, of the Sheep, through the blood of the everlasting Covenant;
make you perfect in every good work, to do his will; working in you that
which is well pleasing in his sight, through JESUS CHRIST: (Heb. 13.20.) And
our LORD JESUS CHRIST himself, and GOD, even our Father, which has loved us,
and has given us everlasting consolation, and good hope through Grace, comfort
your hearts, and stablish you in every good word, and work: 2, These. 2, 16.

Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you
faultlesse, before the presence of his glory, with exceeding joy; to the only
wise GOD, and Savior, be Glory, and Majesty, Dominion, and Power, now, and
ever: Iud. 24.

And now Brethren I commend you to GOD, and to the Word of his Grace, which is
able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are
Sanctified: Acts, 20.32.

The Grace of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, be with you all, Amen. Revel. 22.21.

FINIS.
