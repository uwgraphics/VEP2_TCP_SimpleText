The life so short the craft so long to learn
Thassaye so hard so sharp the conqueryng
The dredeful joy that always flit so yerne
All this mean I by love that my felyng
Astoneth with his wonderful werkyng
So sore ywis that when I on him think
Note I well whethir that I flete or synke
For all be that I know not love in deed
Ne wot how he quyteth folk their hyre
Yet happeth me full often in books read
Of his myraclys and his cruel ire
There find I well he will be lord and sire
I dare not say his strokis ben so sore
But god save such a lord I can no more
Of usage what for lust and what for lore
On books read I often as I you told
But wherefore I speak all this not yore
Agon / it happed me to behold
Upon a book was written with fre^s old
And there upon a certain thing to learn
The long day full fast I read and yerne
For out of old feldes as men seith
Comes all this new corn from year to year
And out of old books / in good feith
Comes all this new science that men lere
But now to purpose of this matere
To read forth I began me so delight
That all the day me thought it but a lyte
This book the which I make of mencion^
Entitled was right thus as I shall tell
Tullius of the dreme of scipyon
Chapitres seven it had of heaven and hell
And earth / and sowles that therein dwell
Of the which as shortly as I can trete
Of his sentence I will you say the great
First tellith it when scipion was comen
In asfrike / how he meteth macenys
That him for joy In arms has ynome
Than tells he her speech and all the blys
That whas bitwen them / til ye day began mys
And how his auncester affrican so dear
Began in his sleep that night to him appear
Than tellith it that from a sterry place
How affrican has him cartage showed
And warned him by fore al of his grace
And said him what man lered or lewd
That loves common prouffyt well yt hewed
He should in to a blisful place wend
There as joy is with enten any end
Than asked he if folk that here ben deed
Have life and dwelling in another place
And affrican said ye with outen any dread
And hou our present worldis lives space
Nis but amaner death what way we trace
And rightful folk shall goo after they dye
To heuene and shewde him the galaxye
Themie shewde he him ye lityl earth ye here is
At the regard of the heuens quantyte
And after showed he him the nine speris
And after that the melodye herd he
That comes of thilke sperys thries three
That wellis of musyk ben and melodye
In this world here and cause of armonye
Then said he him / syn the earth was so lite
And full of torment / and of hard grace
That he ne should him in this world delight
Then told he him in certain yeris space
That eueri sterre should come in to his place
There it was first / and should be out of mind
That in this world is don of al mankind
Then praide him scipion to tell him all
The way to come unto that heaven bliss
And he him said first know thy self mortal
And look ay bisyly that thou werk and wisse
To common prouffit / and thou shall not mysse
To comen swiftly in to that place dear
That full of Joy is / and of sowles clear
But brekers of the law soth to said
And lecherons folk / after they ben deed
Shall whirle about the world in pain
Til many a world be passid out of dread
And then forgyuen al their wickid deed
Then shall they come to that blisful place
To which to come / god the send his grace
The day began fayllen and the derk night
That reueth bestes from her business
Birafte me my book / for lak of light
And to my bed I began me for to dress
Fulfyld of thought and besy heaviness
For both I had thing / which that I nolde
And eek I ne had the thing that I would
But finally my spirit at the last
For weary of my labor all the day
Took rest / that made me to sleep fast
And in my sleep I met as I lay
How affriaine / right in the self array
That Scipion him saw / before that tide
Was come and stood right by my bed side
The weary hunter slepyng in his bed
To the wood again his mind goth anon
The Judge dremeth / hou his plees ben sped
The carter dremeth / hou his cartis gone
The rich of gold ye knyht fight with his son
The seek metith he drynketh of the tonne
The lover metith he has his lady won
Can I not say / if the cause were
For I had red of affrycan biforn
That made me to mete that he stood there
But thus said he thou have the so well born
In lokyng of mine old books to born
Of the which / macrobie roght not a lite
That somdele / of thy labor I will the quyte
Citherea thou blisful lady sweet
That with thy firebro^d dauntest whom ye lest
And made me this sweuen for to mete
Be thou my help in this for thou may best
As wisly / as I saw the north north west
When I began my sweuen for to write
So give me might to ryme it and endite
This forsaid affrican me hente anon
And forth with him to a yate me brought
Right of a park walled with great stone
And on ye yate / with lre^s large ywrought
There were verses wreton / as me thought
On either half / of full great difference
Of which I shall you tell the plain sentence
Through me men go in to that blisful place
Of hertis hele and dedly wondes cure
Through me men gone unto ye well of grace
There grene and lusty may shall ever endure
This is the way to all good adventure
Be glad thou redere and thy sorrow of cast
All open am I pass in and speed the fast
Through me men gone then spak ye other side
Unto mrotal strokes of the spear
Of which disdaygn and danger is the gyde
There never tree shall fruit ne leuys bear
This streme you ledeth to the sorouful were
There as the fyssh in prison is al dry
The schewyng is only the remedy
Thise versis of gold and black ywreton were
The which I began a stounde to biholde
For with that one encrecyd ay my fere
And with that other began my heart to bold
That one me hete that other me cold
None in wit had I for error for to chese
To enter or fle or me to save or lose
For right as between adamantes two
Of even might / a piece of iron set
Ne has no might / to meue to ne fro
For what that one may hale / that other let
So farid I / that nyst whether me was bette
To enter / or leven / til affrican my gyde
Me hente / and shof in at the gates side
And said it stands wreton in thy face
Thyn error if thou tell it not to me
But dread the not / to come in to this place
For this writing is not meant by the
Ne by none / but if he loves servant be
For thou of love have lost the taste I guess
As sekeman has / of sweet and bitterness
But nevertheless al if that thou be dull
If that thou can not do / yet may thou see
For many a man ye may not stand apull
Yet likes to him / at wrastlyng for to be
And demeth yet whethir he do better or he
And if thou had connyng for tendite
I should the show matter of to write
With that my hand in his he took anon
Of which I confort caght / and went in fast
But lord so I was glad / and well begone
For all ouerwhere that I mine eyes cast
Were trees clad with leef ye ay shall last
Each in his kind with color fresh and grene
As emerawde / that Joy it was to seen
The byldar oak / and eke the hardy all he
The piler elm / the cofre unto carayn
The boxtre pyper holin to whyppes basshe
The saylyng fyrre / ye cypress death to plain
The shoter ewe / the aspe for shaftis plain
The olyue of pees / and eke the dro^kin vine
The victour palm / the lawrer to divine
A gardyn saw I full of blossom bows
Upon a river in a grene mede
There as swetnes evermore ynowh is
Of flouris. white. blewe. yelowe. and read
And cold well stremes nothing deed
That swymmen full of small fisshes light
With fynnes read / and skales silver bright
On every boughe the birds herd I sing
With voys of aungellis in her armonye
Som^e besied them their birds forth to bring
Thee litil conyes to their play began hye
And further al about I began aspye
The dredeful Xoo the buk the heart and hind
Squerels and small bestis of gentil kind
On Iustrumentis of strenges in accord
Herd I so pleye a rauysshyng swetenes
That god that maker is of all and lord
Ne herd never better as I guess
There with awi^de uneath it might be less
Made in the leuis grene a noise soft
According to the fowls song a lofte
The air of the place so attempre was
That never was greuance of hete ne oold
There was eke every wholesome spice and gras
Ne noman may there wexe seek ne old
Yet was there Joy more a thousand fold
Then any man can tell ne neu would it night
But ay clear day to any man's sight
Under a tree beside a well I say
Cupide our lord his arows forge and fyle
And at his feet, his how already lay
And will his daughter / te^pred al ye while
The heedes in the well and with her wile
She touched them after they should serve
Som^e for to slay / and som^e to wound and kerue
There I was ware of plesaunce anon right
And of array and lust / and our tasye
And of ye craft ye can and has the might
To do by force a wight to do folly
Dysfygurate was she / I will not lie
And by him self under an oak I guess
Saw I delight that stood by gentilesse
I saw bewte with outen any atyre
And yougthe full of game and Iolyte
Fool hardynes-flaterie and desire
Messagery and mede and other three
Their names shall not her be told for me
And upon pilers great of Jasper long
I saw a temple of bras / yfound strong
About the temple dainised always
Wo^men ynowe of which som^e there were
Fair of them self and som^e of hem were gay
In kyrtlys al dissheueld went they there
That was their office always year by year
And on the temple / of duues whyt and fair
Saw I syttyng many a thousand payr
Before the temple door full soberly
Dame pees sat with a curteyn in her hond
And by her side wonder discretly
Dame patience syttyng there I fond
With face pale upon on hill of sonde
And aldernext with in and eke with out
Byhest and art and of their folk a rowte
Within the temple of syghes hot as fire
I herd a swogh that began about run
Which sighs were engendrid with desire
That made every auter for to brenne
Of new flame and well espied I then
That all ye causis of sorewes that they dry
Comen of the bitter goddess Ialousye
The god priapus saw I as I went
Within the temple in souerayn place stand
In such array as when the ass him shente
With cry by night and with his septre t^ ho^de
Full besily men gun assaye and fond
Upon his head to set of sundry hew
Garlondes full of fressh flowers new
And in a preuy corner in disporte
Fond I venus / and her pert richesse
That was full noble / and haute in of her port
Derk was ye place but afterward lightness
I saw a litil uneath it might be less
And on a bed of gold she lay to rest
Til that the hot son yede to the weste
Her gilt heris with a gold threde
Y bounden were vntressid as she lay
And naked fro the breast unto the head
Men might her see and sothly for to say
The remenant well couerd to my pay
Right with a subtle couerchef of wlence
There was no thykker cloth of defense
The place gaf a thousand savors sote
And bachus god of wyn sat by her side
And ceres next that does of hunger bote
And as I saw amyddes lay cupide
To wom on knees two young folk cryde
To ben their help but thus I let her lie
And ferther in the temple I began epsy
That in despit of dyane the chaste
Full many a vow broken heng on the wall
Of maidens such as began her time wast
In her seruyse and painted overal
Full many a storye which I touch shall
A few as of caliste and athalant
And many a one of which the name I want
Semyramis / candace / and hercules
Cibelle / dido / tesbe / and piramus
Tristram / ysowde / paris / and achilles
Helayne / cleopatre / and troylus
Silla / and eke the mother of romulus
All these were painted on that other side
And all their love and in what plite they did
When I was comen agayn^ / in to the place
That I of spak that was so sweet and grene
Forth welke I tho / my self to solace
There was I waar / where there sat a queen
That as the light somer son shene
Passes the sterre / right so over mesure
She fayrer was than any creature
And in a lawnde upon a hill of flouris
Was set this noble goddess nature
Of braunchis were her hallis and bowris
Y wroght after her taste and her mesure
Ne there was foul that comes of enge^drure
That they ne were pressed in her presence
To take their dome / and give her audience
For this was on saint valentyns day
When every bird comes te chese his make
Of every kind / that men think may
And that so huge a noise began they make
That earth and tree / and see and every lake
So full was / that vunethe was there space
For me to stand / so full was the place
And right as abeyn in the playnt of kind
Devised nature of such array and face
In such array men might her there find
This noble emperesse full of grace
Bad every foul to take her owen place
As they were wont always fro year to year
On saint valentyns day to stonden there
That is to say the foul of Xauyne
Were highest set and then the fowls small
That eten as hem nature would enclyne
As worm or thing of which I tell no tale
And waterfowle sat lowest in the dale
But fowls that live by seed sat on ye grene
And that so feel that wonder was to seen
There might men the rial egle find
That with his sharp look perceth the son
And other egles of a lower kind
Of which that clerkys well deuysen conne
There was ye tyrant with his feathers done
And graye I mean ye goshauke yt does pyne
To birds for his outrageous rauyne
The ge^til fallcon yt with his fet distreineth
The kings hand the hardy sperehauke eke
The quayles foo the merlion that peyneth
Him self full often the lark for to seek
There was the douue with her eyes meke
The Jealous swan^ again his death yt syngeth
The owl eke that of death ye bodwor^ brings
The crane the gea^nt with his tro^pes sown
The thief the choughe and eke the I angli^g pie
The skornyng Iaye the egles foo herowne
The false lapwynk full of trecherye
The stare that the counceil can bewrye
The tame ruddok and the coward kyte
The cok the orloge of the thorpes lyte
The sparow venus sone the nyghtyngale
That clepeth forth the grene leaves new
The swalow mortherar of the fowls small
That maken houy of flowers fressh of hew
The wedded turtil with her heart true
The pecok with his armgellis feathers bright
The fesaunt skorner of the cok by night
The waker goos / the cuekow ever unkind
The popengay full of delycaisye
The drake / stroyer of his owen kind
The stork wrekar of aduoultrye
The hot cormeran^t full of glotonye
The ravens and crows with their voys of air.
The throstil old / and the frosty feldfare
What should I say of fowlis of euy kind
That in this world have feathers and stature
Men might in that place assemblid find
Before the noble gods of nature
And each of hem did his besy cure
Benyngly to chese or for to take
By her accord his fourmel or his make
But to the point nature held on her hand
A fourmele egle of shap the gentillest
That ever she among her werkis fond
The most benygne / and the goodlyest
In her was every virtue at his rest
So ferforth / ye nature her self had bliss
To look on her / and often her bek began kiss
Naturve the vicaire of thalmyghty lord
That hot. cold. heavy. light. moist and dreye
Has knytte by even nombre and accord
In esy wys began to speak and seye
Fowlis take keep of my sentence I preye
And for your ese in furthryng of your need
As fast as I may speak I will you speed
Ye known well how that saint vale^tins day
By my statute and through my gouerna^ce
Ye come for to chese and fle your way
With your make as I prik you with plesa^ce
But nevertheless my rightful ordenance
May I not let for all this world to win
That he that is most worthy shall begin
The tersel egle as ye that known well
The foul Xial abouen you in degree
The wise the worthy secret trwe as stele
The which I formed as ye may see
In every point as it best likes me
Hit needs not his shap you to deuyse
He shall first chese and speken in his gyse
And after him by order shall ye chese
After your kind / eueriche as you likes
And as your hap is / shall ye win or lose
But which of you / ye love most entriketh
God send hem her / that sorest for him siketh
And there with all / the tercel began she call
And said my sone the choice is to the fall
But nevertheless on this condition
Mote be the choys / of euerich that is here
That she agree to his eleccio^n
Who so he be that shall be her fere
This is our usage / always year by year
And who so may have at this time his g^ce
In blisful time he come in to this place
With head inclined and with full humble chere
This rial tercel spack and tarried naught
Unto my souerayn lady / and not my fere
I chees and chese withwil heart and thought
The fourmel on your hand so wely wrought
Whose I am al / and ever shall her serve
Do what her list to do me live or sterue
Besechyng her of marcy and of grace
As she that is my lady sovereign
Or late me dye present in this place
For certes long I may not live in pain
For in my heart coruen is every vain
And having reward only to my truth
My dear heart have of my woo som^e routhe
And if I be found to her untrue
Disobeysan^t or wilful necligent
Auaunter / or in process love anewe
I pray to / god this be my Judgment
That with thise fowls I be al to rent
That ylke day / that ever she me find
To her untrue / or in my gylt unkind
And since that none loves her so well as I
Al be that she never of love me behette
Then ought she be mine through her mercy
For other bond can I none on her knytte
Ne never for none other shall I let
To louen her / hou far so that she wend
Say what you list / my tale is at an end
Right as the fressh read rose new
Again the somer son colored is
Right so for shame / as wexen began the hew
Of this fourmel / when she herd all this
She neither answered well / ne said amys
So sore abasshid was she / til that nature
Said daughter / dread you not I you assure
Another tersel egle spack anon
Of lower kind and said that should not be
I love her better / than ye do by saint John
Or at the least / I love as well as ye
And longer have served her in my degree
And if she should love / for long loving
To me allone should ben the guerdonyng
I dare eke say if she me find falls
Unkind Iangler / or rebel in any wise
Or Jealous / do me hang by the hals
And but I bear me in her seruyse
As well as my wit can me suffyse
Fro point to point her honor for to save
Take she my life / and all the good I have
The third tersel egle answered tho
Now sizs ye seen the lityl leyser here
For every foul cries out to ben ago
Forth with his make / or with his lady dear
And eke nature her self / ne will not here
For taryeng / not half that I would seye
And but I speak / I must for sow we deye
Of long seruyse auaunt I me nothing
But as possible is me to deye this day
For woo / as he that has be languysshyng
This twenty year / and well it happen may
A man to serve bette / and more to pay
In half a year / al if it were no more
Than some men do / yt have served full yore
I say not this by me / for I ne can
Do no seruyse / that may my lady plese
But I dar say / I am her trewest man
As to my dome / and faynest would her plese
At short words / til that death me sese
I will ben heeris / whether I wake or wynke
And true in all that heart may think
Of al my life / since first that I was bore
So gentil plee in love or other thing
Ne herd I never / ne noman me before
Who that had leyzer and connyng
For to reherce their chere and spekyng
And from the morn^ / began their speech last
Til dounward went the son wonder fast
The noise of foulis for to be delyuerd
So loud ronge / have don / and late us wend
That well I wend the wode had alto shyuerd
Come of / they cried / alas ye will us shende
When shall your cursid pleting have an end
How should a Judge either party leave
For ye or nay withouten any preue
The goos the doke and the cukko also
Cryden keke. keke cucko. queke. queke hye
That through mine eris the noise went tho
The goos said all this is not worth aflye
But I can shape hereof a Xemedye
And I will say my verdyte fair and swythe
For waterfoule who so be wroth or blythe
And I for wormfowle / said ye lewd cuckoo
For I will of mine owen auctorite
For common speed / take on me ye charge now
For to deliver us / hit were great charity
Ye may abide a wyle yet parde
Said the turtil / if it be your will
Awight may speak / him were better be still
I am a sede foul one of vnworthyest
That wot I well and lityl of connyng
But better is that a wyghtis tongue rest
Than entermete them of such doing
Of which they nether read can ne sing
And who so does / full fowl him self acloyeth
For office vnco^myttyd / full often anoyeth
Nature which that always had an ere
To mormur of the lewdnes by kind
With faco^dewis said hold your to^gis there
And I shall sone I hope a counceyl find
You to deliver / and fro this noise unbind
I charge of every folk / that ye one call
To say the verdyt / for you fowls all
Assentid were to this conclusion
The birds all / and the fowls of Xauyne
Have chosen first / by plain election^
The tercelet of the fawcon to diffyne
All her sentence / and as him list termyne
And to nature / him gu^ne present
And she accept him with glad entente
The tercelet said thrnne in this manner
Full hard were it to preuen by reason
Who loves best this gentil fourmel here
For euerich has such replecacion
That by skylles may none be brought doun^
I can not see that argumentis auaylle
Theme seems it well / there must be battle
All ready quod these terselis egles tho
Nay sirs said he / if I durst it say
Ye do me wrong / my tale is not al dod
For sirs take ye not to greef I you pray
Hit may not gone as ye would in this way
Our is the wys that have the charge on ho^de
And to the Iuges domes ye mote stand
And therefore pees I say / as to my wit
Me would think / hou that the worthyest
Of knyghthode / and lengest had used it
Most of estate / of blood the gentillest
Were sittynge for her / if that her lest
And of thise three / she wot her self I trow
Who that he be / for it is ethe to know
The waterfowles have her heedes leyd
To geder / and of short auysement
When eueryth had his large golye said
They seyden sothly al by one assent
How that the goos with her faconde gent
That she desired to pronon^ce our need
Shall tele our tale / and pray to god lxr speed
And for these waterfowlis / tho began
The goos to speak in her kakelyng
She said pees / now take keep every man
And herkne which a reason I shall forth bring
My wit is sharp / I love no taryeng
I say I read him though he were my brother
But she will love him late him love another
Lo here a parsight reason of a goos
Quod the sperhauke / never mote she the
Lo such is hit to have a tongue loos
Now parde fool / yet were it bet for the
Have hold thy pees / than showed thy nycete
Hit lies not in his wit / ne in his will
But soth is said / a fool can not be still
The laughter rose of gentil fowls all
And right anon the seed fowl chosen had
The turtle true / and began her to him call
And praid her to say / the soth sad
Of this matere / and asked what she rad
And she answered that pleynly her intent
She would declare / and sothly what she me^t
Nay god forbede / a lover should change
The turtle said / and wex for shame al read
If that his lady / evermore be strange
Yet late him serve her ever / til he be deed
For sothe I preyse not the gooses reed
For if she deyde / I would none other make
I would be hers / til that the death me take
Well bourded quoth the doke by my hatte
That men should always louen causeles
Who can a reason find or wit in that
Daunseth he merry he that is myrthles
Who should recche that is reccheles
Ye queke said the doke full well and fair
There ben mo sterres god wot than a pair
Now fie chorle quoth the gentil tercelet
Out of ye donghyl came that word full right
Thou can not see which thing is well beset
Thou farist by love / as owl does by light
The day them bli^des well they see by night
Thy kind is of so low wrecchednes
That what love is thou can not see ne guess
Tho began the cuckoo put him forth in prees
For fowlis that eten worms and said by live
So I quoth he may have my make in pees
I recche never how long that ye siryue
Late each of hem be soleyn al their live
This is my read since they may not accord
This short lesson needs not to record
Ye have the gloton filled y now his paunche
Than ar we well said the merlion
Thou mortherer of the heysug on the branche
That brought the forth thou rewful gloton
Live thou soleyn worms corupsion
For no force is of lak of thy nature
Go lewd be you whiles this world may dure
Now pees said nature I comande here
For I have herd all your oppynyon
And maffay yet ar we never the nere
But finally this is my conclusion^
That she her self shall have the election^
Of whom her list who so be wroth or blithe
Him that she chese shall her have as swythe
For since it may not here discussed be
Who loves her best as said the terselet
Then shall I do this favor to her that she
Shall have right him on whom her heart is set
And he her that his heart has on her knet
This Judge I nature for I may not lie
To none estate I have none other eye
But as for counceyl for to these a make
If it were reason / then would I
Counceyl you the Xyal tercel take
As said the tercelet full skilfully
As for the gentilest and most worthy
Whom I have wroght so well to my plesan^ce
That to you ought have been a suffysaunce
With dredeful voys ye formele her auswerd
My right full lady goddess of nature
Soth it is that I am under your yerd
And must be youris while my lif may dure
And so must be euerych ylk a ceature
And therefore grant me my first bone
And mine intent / I will you say right sone
I grant it you quoth she and right anon
This formele egle spoke in this degree
Al mighty queen unto this year be done
I ask respyte for to advise me
And after that / to have my choice fre
This is al and som^e / that I will speak and seye
Ye get no more al if ye do me deye
I will not serve venus ne cupide
Forsothe als yet by no manner of way
Now fith it may non other ways betide
Quod nature here is no more to say
Then will I that these fowls were away
Each with his make for taryeng longer here
And said hem thus as ye shall after dear
To you speak I ye tersellis quod nature
Be ye of good heart and serve ye al three
Ayere is not so long to endure
And ylk of you pain him in his degree
For to do well for god wot quyt is she
Fro you this year what after so befalle
This entermesse is dressid for you all
And wha^ this werk al brought was to ane^de
To every foul nature gaf his make
By even acorde and on their way they we^de
And lord the bliss and Joy they make
For each of hem began other in wings take
And with her neckis each began other wind
Tha^kyng always the noble gods of kind
But first were chosen / fowls for to syn^ge
As year by year was always her vsance
To sing a roundel at her departing
To do nature honor laud and plesance
The note I trow made was in france
The words were such as ye may here find
The next verse / as I now have in mind
Que bien aim / tarde oublie
And with ye shoutyng / when ye soug was do
That fowls made at her flight away
I woke / and other books took me to
To read upon / and yet I red always
I hope ywis to read so som^e day
That I shall mete som^e thing for to fare
The better / and thus to read I will not spare

Here next follows a tretyse / which John Gkogan Sent unto the lords and
gentilmen of the kings hows / exortyng them to lose no time in their yougthe /
but to use virtues.
My noble sons / and also my lords deer
I your fader called unworthily
Send unto you / this lytyl tretyse here
Wreton with my hand full rudely
And though it be / that I not reverently
Have wreton to your estates / I you pray
Mine uncunning take it benygnly
For gods sake / and herkne what I say
I complain when I remember me
The sodein age / that is upon me fall
More I complain / my myspent Iuuente
Which is Impossible again for to call
But certainly / the most complaynt of all
Is to thenke / that I have been so nyce
That I ne would virtues to me call
In all my yougthe / but vices ay chery^^
Of wylke I ask mercy of the lord
That art almighty god in mageste
Be sechyng the to make so even accord
Between the and my soul / that vanyte
Worldly lust nor blind prosperyte
Have no lordship / of my flessh so freel
The lord of virtue and parfight unity
Put fro me vices / for my sowles heel
And give me myht while I have life and space
Me to conform fully to thy plesaunce
Show upon me the habundan^ce of thy grace
In good werkis grante me perseueraunce
Of al my yougthe forgete the ygnoran^ce
Give me good will to serve the ay to queme
Set al my life after thyn ordenan^ce
And able me to mercy / or thou deem
My lords dear why I this conpleynyng write
To you / whom^ that I love eutierly
Is for to warn you / as I can endyte
That time lost in yougthe folily
Greueth a wight bodily and gostly
I mean him / that to vices list entende
Wherefore I pray you lords specially
Your yougthe in virtue shape ye to dispende
Think how between virtue and estate
There is a blissid parfyght marriage
Virtue is cause of pees vice of debate
In man's soul / for which with full courage
Cherisshe ye virtue / the vices to outrage
Drive ye away / late hem have wo^nyng
That your sowles lose not the heritage
Which god has given to vertuus living
Take ye head also how folk of pour degree
Through virtue have been set in great honor
And ever have lived in great prosperity
Through cherisshyng of virtuous labor
Think also / how many agouernour
Called to estate / has been set full low
Through misusyng of right / and of error
Therefore I counceile / virtue / that ye know
Thus by your eldres ye may nothing claim
As my master chawcer seith express
But te^peral thing / yt may hurt and mayme
Then god is stock / of virtuous noblesse
And sythen he is lord of blessidnesse
And made us all / and for us all deyde
Follow ye him in virtue with full business
And of this thing / herkne hou it is seyde
The first stok / fader of gentilnesse
What man that claymeth gentil for to be
Must follow his trace and his wits dress
Virtue to follow / and vices for to fle
For unto virtue longs dignyte
And not the reuerce / saufly dar I deem
Al were he mytor crown or dyademe
This first stok was full of rightwisnes
True of his word / sobre pyetous and free
Clean of his ghost / and loved besynes
Again vice of slouthe / in honest
And but his eyer love virtue as did he
He is not gentil though he rich seem
Al were he mytor crown or diadem
Vice may well be to hold richesse
But there may no man / almen may well see
Bequethe his eyer / his virtuous noblesse
That is appropred unto no degree
But to the first fader in mageste
That makes hem eyres / that can hem qneme
Al were he crown mytor or diadem
Plant the rote of yougthe / in such awyse
That in virtue / your growyng be always
Look ay godenes / be in your excersyse
That shall you mighty make at each asay
The friend for to withsto^de / and his affray
Pass ye wisely this perilous pilgremage
Think ye on this word and wirke every day
That shall you give a parfyt flourid age
Take ye also head / hou ye thise noble clerkis
Written our books / of great sapience
Sayng that feyth is deed with out werkis
So is estate without Intelligence
Of virtue / therefore with diligence
Shape ye of virtue / so to plant the rote
That ye come by experyence
To worship of life / and sowlis bote
Think also that lordship / ne other astate
Without virtue / may not long endure
Think also / hou vice and virtue be at debate
Has been and shall be whiles ye world may dure
And ever the vicyous / by adventure
Is ouerthrawe / and thinks euermere
That god is lord of virtue and figure
Of al godenes / therefore follow ye the lore
My master chawcer / god his soul have
That in his langage was so curyous
He said the fader that is ded and in grave
Bequeth nothing his virtue with his house
Unto his sone / therefore laboryous
Owe ye to be / bysechyng god of grace
Through which / ye ought to be virtuous
And grant you to get part of his place
Here may ye see / that virtuous nobles
Comes not to you / by way of auncetrye
But it comes through leefful besynes
Of honest life / and not by slogardye
Wherefore in yougthe / I read you edyfye
The house of virtue / in such a manner
That in your age / it keep you and gye
Fro the tempest of worldly wawes sere
Lo he the noble poet of bretayne
Hou he tells in virtuous sentence
The loss of yougthe / and virtue began co^pleyne
Wherefore I pray you do your diligence
For goddis love / and gods reverence
To enprynte virtue / in your mind
That when ye come in your Iug^es presence
Ye be not set / as vertules behind
Ye lords / can a manner now a days
Thaugh one show you a virtuous matere
Your fervent thought / is of falls alayes
That of that art / ye have no Joy to here
But as a ship that is withouten stere
Ay rowi^g up and down without gouerna^ce
Wenyng ye the calm will last year by year
Right so fare ye through ygnoraunce
For very shame know ye not by reason
That after an ebb there comes a flode rage
In such wise wha^ yougthe passes his seson
Comes crooked and unwieldy age
And sone after come kalendes of dotage
And if your yougthe no virtue has provided
All men will say / fie on your vasselage
Thus has slouthe / fro worship you divided
Borce the clerk / as men may read and see
Says in his book of consolacon^
What man desires to have of the vyn^ tree
Plentyuous fruit / in the ripyng seson
Must aye eschew to do oppression^
Unto the rote / whiles it is young and grene
Ye may see / by this conclusion
That yougthe vertueles does often much tene
Seen there again how virtuous noblesse
Roted in yougthe with good perseueran^ce
Dryueth a way al vice and wrecehidnesse
As slogardy Xyot / and dystaunce
Seen also / holy virtue causes suffysance
And suffysance exyleth couetyse
Thus who so has virtue / has al habon^da^ce
Of welfare / as fer as reason can deuyse
Take heed of Tullius and of him hostilius
That fro pouert come to high degree
Through virtue / read ye also of Julius
The conqueror / hou pour a man was he
That through his virtue and his humanyte
Of many a contre / had he governance
Thus virtue brings to hye degree
Every wight that list do him attendance
Read here again of nero vertueles
Take heed also of proud baltazare
They hated vertuys. equity and pees
Look how anthiocus fyl fro his chare
That the skyn and the bones al to tare
Look what mischan^ce they had for their vicis
Who so will not by thise signs beware
I dar well say / Infortunat or nyce he is
I can say no more / but hereby may ye see
Hou virtue / parfight charity cawses
And vices exyles al prosperyte
The best is to chese as I guess
But do as ye list / I me excuse express
I will be sorry / if that ye me myschese
God conform you / in virtuous goodness
So that through necligence / no thing ye lose
Thus ends the traytye wiche John Skogan sent to the lords and estates of
the kings house.
With empty hand men may no hawks lure
Bye if thou may / for all is for to selle
Lytyl wit suffyseth with good adventure
And always as the wi^de stands set thy melle
The heuene to heuens lord / and feend to hell
Man to the world p^te^de / and thou shall strecche
And wene thy self be noght / and be a wrecche
The good counceyl of chawcer
Fle ye fro ye prees and dwell with sothfastnes
Suffyse unto the good if it be small
For horde has hate / and clym^yng tikelnes
Prese has envy / and well is blent over al
Sauoure no more / than the behoue shall
Read well thy self that other folk read
And truth the shall delyue / it is no dread
Pain the not each crooked to redress
In trust of her / that torneth as a balle
Great rest standith in litil business
Beware also to spurn again an all
Strive not as does a crock with a wall
Deem thy self / that demest others deed
And truth ye shall deliue it is no dread
That the is sent / resceyue in buxomnes
The wrastlyng of this world axith a fall
Here is no home / here is but wilderness
Forth pilgrim / forth best out of thy stall
Look upon high / and thank god of all
Weyue thy lust / and late thy ghost the led
And truth the shall deliver / it is no dread
Balade of the vilage without peyntyng
Playntyf to fortune
This wrecchid worlds transmutacon^
As well as woo / now pour / and now honor
Without order or due discrecion^
Governed is / by fortunes error
But natheles the lack of her favor
Ne may not do me sing / though I dye
I ay tout perdu mon temps it labor
For finally fortune I desfye
Yet is me left the sight of my resoun
To know friend fro foo / in thy myrrour
So much has yet thy tornyng up and down
Y taught me / to known in an hour
But trewly no fors of thy reddour
To him that over him self has maystrye
My suffysance shall be my socour
For finally fortune I deffye
O socrates thou steadfast champion
She might never be thy tormentour
Thou never dreddest her oppression
Ne in her chere fond thou no favor
Thou knew the deceyte of her color
And that her most worship is for lie
I know her eke a falls dissymylour
For finally fortune I deffye
Thanswer of fortune to the pleintyf
No man is wrecchid but him self it wene
And he that has him self / has suffysance
Why say thou / then I am to the so kene
That have thy self / out of my governance
Seye thus / gra^nt mercy of thin habunda^ce
That you have le^t or this thou shall not strive
What woost thou yet / hou I the will aua^ce
And eke thou have thy best friend a live
I have the taught deuysion between
Friend of effect / and friend of co^ntenance
The needs not the galle of none hiene
That cures eyes derk for penance
Now see thou clear you were in ygnorance
Yet holt thyn anchor / and yet you may arryue
There bounte bears the keye of my substance
And eke thou have thy best friend a live
How many have I refused to sustene
Syn I have the fostred in thy plesaunce
Wilthou then^e make a statute on thy queen
That I shall be ay at thyn ordenaunce
Thou born art in my regne of variaunce
About the whele with other must thou drive
My lore is bett / than wick is thy greuaunce
And eke thou have thy best friend a live
Thanswer to fortune
Thy lore I dampne / it is aduersite
My friend may thou not reave blind goddess
That I thy friends know / I thank it the
Take hem again / let hem go lie a press
The nygardes / in keeping her richesse
Prenostik is thou wolt her tour assaylle
Wyck appetite comth ay before sickness
In general this rule may not fail
Fortune
Thou pynchest at my mutabilite
For I the lent a drope of my richesse
And now me likes / to withdraw me
Why sholdest thou my Xyalte oppress
The sea may ebb and flow more and less
The welke^ has might to shine teme and hail
Right so must I / kythe my brotylnesse
In general this rule may not fail
The pleyntyf
Lo thexecucon^ of the mageste
That all purueyeth of his rightwisnes
That same thing / fortune clepen ye
Ye blind bestes full of lewdnes
The heuene has properte of sikernes
This world has ever restles trauayll
The last day is end of mine entrees
In general this rule may not fail
Thenuoye of fortune
Pryncis I pray you of your gentyllesse
Let not this man on me thus cry and pleyne
And I shall quyte you this business
And if ye list / releue him of his pain
Pray ye his best friend of his noblesse
That to some better estate / he may atteyne
Thenuoye of chaucer to skegan
To broken ben the statutes hye in heaven
That create were / eternally tendure
Syn that I see / the bright goddis seven
Mow weep and wayle / and passion endure
As may in earth a mortal crature
Alas frowhens / may this thing proceed
Of which error / I dye almost for dread
By word eterne whylom was it shape
That fro the fyfthe cerl^^e in no manner
Ne might of teris down^ escape
But now so wepeth venus in her spear
That with her teris / she will drenche us here
Alas scogan / this is for thyn offense
Thou causest this deluge of pestilence
Have thou not said in blaspheme of ye gods
Through pride or through thy great rekelesnes
Such thing as in ye law of love forbode is
That for thy lady / saw not thy distres
Therefore thou yaf her up at mighelmes
Alas scogan of old folk ne young
Was never erst scogan blamed for his tongue
