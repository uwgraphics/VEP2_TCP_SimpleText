Guystarde and Sygysmonde,

Here follows the amerous hystory of Guystarde and Sygysmonde / and of their
dolorous death by her father / newly translated out of laten in to engysshe by
Wyllym^ Walter servant to sir Henry Marney knight chaunceler of ye duchy of
Lancastre.



R. Coplande to the translatour.
THynflammate desire / of your good intent
News to compyle / eschewynge ydelnesse
Comes of grace / and of wisdom excellent
To occupy tuche / as have no business
which vtu of doing / much harm does oppress
For surely ydelnesse / is portresse of all sin
Every vice / ready to let in
The wretched life / of osyosyte
Engenders sloth / pouerte and pain
It is nouryce / of voluptuosyte
And sets the mind on all things vain
It sleeth the body / and troubles the brain
Vnstedyeth the wit / and wastes good deed
And lets virtue / and goodness to proceed
Example plain / of idle Sygysmonde
^edde deyntely / no manner work to use
which caused ydelnesse / for to habonde
And unto pleasure / set only for to muse
Dance / song / and play / she did not refuse
which things assembled / engendered delight
Ot natural lust / to do her appetyte
Here lacks business / and good pastyme
Grace of good doing / was from her exyled
Caught as a bird / tangled with lyme
Fyr it by one feder / and than with all begyled
Right so who with this vice is fyled
Take with one sin / all other does ensue
Er go / good business / is gate of virtue
Thus ends the prologue.
How Sygysmonde after ye death of her husband was enamored of one Guystarde a
man of her faders house.
Prince of Salerne sometime was one Ta^cerde
A noble man gentle lowly and sage
Greatly praised for his manhood and ded
If he had not take vengeance in his age
Of two lovers / done by his fell courage
For they loved each other tenderly
By cruel mean he caused them to die
This noble man had never other child
But a daughter of excellent beauty
Prudent in her youth sage and nothing wild
Her father loved her right tenderly
So loathe he was to lose her company
That no man could have her in marriage
Till that she was above her lawful age
Sygysmonde was the name of this lady
which was wedded with her faders counseyle
Unto the dukes sone of Campany
But in short time after their espousayle
Death with his darte her husband did assail
After whose death she did not long soiourne
But to her father she did home return
Of shape and person she was well fourmed
Her face and color fair and amyable
Nature in beauty her so fornysshed
That none to her was equiperable
Her manner and wisdom commendable
In all her deeds she was excellent
More than to woman is expedyent
In her faders house she long soiournynge
In welthe and ease and great prosperyte
Her faders mind when she had perceiving
How he in her had such felycyte
That to mary her he would not agree
And how it should be shame for him to require
To accomplysshe her pleasure and desire
Wherefore she concluded in her mind
Some gentle man for her lover to chose
which would unto her be secret and kind
with whom she might her pleasure sometime use
The chance of love she could no wise refuse
Cupyde so sore her heart had set on fire
That need she must accomplysshe her desire
Of nobles and other of mean degree
Her faders house was greatly fornysshed
As noble householders are wont for to be
Sygysmonde their manners often regarded
Among whom one out she had espied
Virtuous / humble / steadfast / prew / and sage
How be it he was but of small lygnage
This noble young man Guystarde had ye name
Upon whom often Sygysmonde her look did cast
His noblesse her heart did sore inflame
And for she had full often found him steadfast
Him for to love she was nothing aghast
His sad behauour wounded her sore
That love in her increased more and more
This young man likewise of wit excellent
Perceiving the noblesse of this lady
In her love so fervently he brent
That night nor day he could rest quyetly
To love his mind so much he did apply
That by desire he was so sore oppressed
His paynfull love he could in no wise dygest
Each of other was sore enamoured
Yet none of them knew the others mind
Sygysmonde nothing so much desired
As Guystarde in a secret place to find
To whom she might bewray her love so kind
To none other she durst show her purpose
Leest they to her father would it dysclose
She coueytynge her mind for to fulfill
All her mind she wrote in a lettere
And in an holowe read she put the byll
And to him she gave it with smiling chere
Bidding him to bear it to her chambere
And to deliver it unto her maid
To kyndle the fire / it was good she said
Guystarde than took the foresaid read
Saying he would soon do her commandment
But in his thought he well ymagyned
It was not given him but for some intent
wherefore unto his chamber he forth went
And brake the read / wherein he did espy
The letter enclosed right secretly
When that he had over red the byll well
wherein her purpose he had perceived
He was so merry that no tongue can tell
The joy which his heart had supprysed
For it was the thing he most desired
wherefore he agreed her mind to fulfill
According to the tenoure of the byll
R. Copla^de to these lovers in the effect of their love
SE here in love / the merueylous effect
without foresyght / compassynge ye end
Only of lust / the doing to coniect
As by this lady / which did condescende
Unto this knight / her mind so to have pende
Not regarding / her state of wy dowheed
Honor and good fame / forgetynge as deed
O folysshe Guystarde / O unwise Sygysmonde /
O new Pryamus / O young wanton Thysbe /
was no reason / nor fere in you found
To pondre of Tancrede / the inward cruelte
O blind love / such is thy properte
Youth to enclose with thy lubryke fire
Nothing regarded / but to do their desire
Alas Guystarde where is thy memory
Thou do not pondre thy masters gentylnesse
which from thy youth has fostred tenderly
His house and daughter thou wylt pollute rechelesse
Thou wylt dystayne / his honor and nobleness
His love thou lesest / his good word and his deed
Beware / such service / such is the wage or mede
How after that Guystarde had received ye read of Sygysmonde he found the cave
where through he went to her chamber.


THere was a cave ioynynge unto the place
which was out of man's remembrance past
For it was not used of long space
On the top thereof in light for to cast
There was an hole which wos so old and wast
That thorns and breres did it over grow
So that the enter thereof none might know
And from the cave there was a secret way
which of no creature was espied
Unto the chamber where as Sygysmonde lay
The way thereof so long was dysused
The door of the said cave was fast barred
which passage was stopped so secretly
That hard it was the encrynge to espy
Sygysmonde by the secret introduccyon
Of love from whose eyes nothing can be hyd
Of the said cave she found the entering soon
And in to it alone she descended
Both length and depnesse she well regarded
And to Guystarde she made thereof report
By writing how he might to her resort
Guystarde of this being aduertysed
Ordered all thing mete to his business
A ledder cote for him he devised
From thorns and breres to keep him harmless
And in the night thither he did him dress
And by a rope in to the cave did slide
And there for her all night he did abide
In the morning when the day began to appear
Sygysmonde caused to avoid by a train
The maids which lay within her chambere
Saying that night she could not sleep for pain
And quyetly than to rest she would feign
And after them she locked fast the door
Of her purpose she thought she would be sure
Into the cave she gothe incontinent
Finding Guystarde / she often did him embrace
In to her chamber they both after went
And unto bed they yede for their solace
Their pleasant life they continue a space
Enforsynge them self to please each other
Till it was time for them to dysseuer
Guystarde in to the cave went secretly
After whom she locked the door full fast
And to her maidens she went hastily
But he durst not while the day did last
Go from the cave but when mydnyght was past
He went out so that none him espied
And unto his house fast he him hyed
Often times this custom they used
Their life amorous ledynge covertly
Of a long time it was not perceived
But fortune which is always contrary
By his hard chance these lovers did dyscry
So that with sorrow ended their pleasure
There is no joy that always may endure
Tancrede alone used customably
Unto his daughters chamber to resort
And on her bed to sleep sometime would ly
Or else with her to find some game and sport
In her talking he had full great consort
And when he had been there a certain space
He would depart unto some other place
He came unto her chamber on a day
while she was with her maidens in the gardyne
He seeing that she was besy in play
Beside her bed he did him self declyne
Before his face he did draw the curtyne
A soft pylowe under his heed he cast
His weary body fell a sleep full fast
Sygysmonde before her chamber wyndowes shyt
For with Guystarde she had made apoyntment
The same day to have a merry fyt
And when she thought her time conuenyent
Out of the gardyne secretly she went
And unto her chamber she resorted
And after her the door she fast locked
She not knowing her father there a sleep
The cave door she opened with her kay
And caused Guystarde out of it to crepe
And on the bed as they were wont always
Of Venus they used the sport and play
So that by noise and words that they did make
Tancrede her father out of his sleep did wake
Tancrede from his sleep moved suddenly
All their pastyme he well aduertysed
At the first time he did think for to cry
But in him self he well delybered
By silence his mind should be better sped
And that he might with delyberacyon
Upon them both take just correccyon
Where from noise he kept him self full close
These lovers when they had done their pleasure
With glad semblaunt they both from ye bed rose
The deed they thought right secret and sure
In to the cave which was deep and obscure
Guystarde went in as he was wont to do
And Sygysmonde did to her maidens go
R. Coplande by exclamacyon to fortune.
Unstable fortune / tomblynge as the sea
Tha^ yse more slypper frosen after rain
Here is thy deed / here is thy properte
Never in one / but chaungeable sudden
These two lovers / by thy bryttle train
Thou have assembled / and now wylt dysceuer
A worthy act / this is thy guyse ever
Pryam and Thy she / thou goodly behyght
Dydo to Ene / thou caused to combyne
Arcyte to Emely / in sturdy fight
And Heleyn to Paris / holly to enclyne
Ypomyneus to Athelant of noble line
Troylus to Cresede / by reason of Pandare
At last unawares / thou dydest them separe
O fortune hard / of chances most extreme
To bring her father / O wicked slack traytresse
was there none other person in all the reme
For to dyscouer / their secret business
None? no / alas here is great heaviness
Of any other / it might have been denayde
But nay for sothe / thou fortune have them trayde
How Guystarde was taken coming out of the cave.


TAncrede for this chance being troubled
From the chamber secretly did issue
And with watch men the cave he enclosed
within the night Guystarde for to pursue
As he came out they took this lover true
In his ledder cote as he was clothed
Before Tancrede they have him presented
Tancrede unto him spoke thus cruelly
Guystarde my kyndnesse has not deserved
That thou should do to me this vylany
which with mine eyes this day I espied
I have always the greatly favored
Thou have dishonored me by thine offense
For kyndnesse shame thou do me recompense
The true lover answered pyteously
Unto Tancrede saying sir for certain
The hard chance of love no man can deny
It is greater than is the power humayne
From it I could my self in no wise refrain
Your puyssaunce may not unto love compare
Love is so great that it will no man spare
This prince for this being full of sorrow
Commanded him to be kept in prysone
And after dinner on the next morrow
Unto his daughters chamber he went right soon
All were avoided save they two alone
with heavy chere thus unto her he said
which knew nothing her council was bewrayd
Sygysmonde I have been long dysceyued
By your honest virtue and sad prudence
which unto me so steadfast appeared
That in you I had so great confydence
Thinking ye would never do such offense
No man could have made me it to believe
If with mine eyes the deed I did not preue
Thy heinous trespace does my heart sore grieve
which contynually is in my thought
That the small time which I have to leave
In sorrow to end thou have it now brought
At leest if thou had minded to be naught
Thou should have taken one to thy degree
Conuenyent the less the fault had be
But of the multitude that use my hall
Thou have chosen Guystarde thy love to be
which is most simple and poorest of them all
Not gentle borne but come of low degree
whom we have nourysshed for charity
wherefore I am so wrapped in sorrow
That what to do as yet I do not know
Of Guystarde which is in captyuyte
what I will do I am delybered
But what punysshement I shall take on the
As yet my mind is not determined
Love would the offense to be pardoned
The trespace requires vengeance certain
Justice would punysshe / nature would refrain
Therefore my mind as yet is varyable
Not knowing what to done what counceyll
Should to this matter be most profitable
But I thought first to know thy mind and will
And upon that my pleasure to fulfill
These words said / he cast aside his eye
And like a child he wept haboundauntly
Sygysmonde herynge her father thus speak
And how Guystarde was put in prison deep
For sorrow her heart in two did nyghe break
Uneath from sownynge she could her self keep
But lamentably she full fast did weep
Knowing their love to be dyscouered
which of long time had be full closely hyd
She vaynquysshynge her fentynyne courage
with constant mind she did cease to lament
For anger she knyt the brows and vysage
And for to dye in heart she did assent
If Guystarde dyed by her faders Judgment
wherefore of death she being not dysmayd
Unto her father these words she said
Father your mercy I will not require
Sith your mind ^s my lover for to kill
I shall nothing obtain of my desire
And as for me it shall be at your will
whyder that ye will my life do save or spyll
The one I know well I shall never get
The other to have I do not covet
Wherefore your mercy I do now despise
And with good reason for to purge my fame
Of this my deed let it you now suffyse
That ye your self of it are most to blame
For I had never come unto this shame
If it had not ben by your neclygence
Sith I did ill / it is but your offense
To love Guystarde I knowledge and confess
And ever shall while that my life does last
which is but short the trewthe for to express
My heart and will shall ever be steadfast
If love may be when that the life is past
Him for to love / my heart shall never sease
But and it may / it shall rather increase
Father ye should have well consydred
That I am not made of iron nor stone
But of your flesh and nature engendered
And though that by age your courage is gone
Of youth ye should have consyderacyon
How they be brent with right fervent desire
Of floue which does their hertes sore set on fire
Forthermore ye might right well consider
That ydelnesse and delycate fedynge
In young people to lust is a breder
And how I am in young age florysshynge
And of my husband having knowledgynge
Of love what the delycyousnes meant
Wherefore with desire I should soon be brent
I being in voluptuosyte
Both night and day my mind I did apply
My flamynge hete how quenched it might be
without man's help I know no remedy
wherefore my courage for to satysfy
In secret wise I thought to use the game
So that no man thereof me should dysfame
Love and fortune my purpose for derynge
A secret cave they made me for to find
whereof no man had any knowledgynge
which cave auaunced my desire and mind
Thinking I might secretly use my kind
But to your knowledge I greatly meruell
The entering thereof how that ye could tell
Guystarde I have not loved faynedly
As most women be wont of their usage
But of long time I did dylygently
Begarde his good manners and wisdom sage
His constaunt virtue / and manly courage
Or I would unto him any love cast
which is so sure that it shall ever last
But for he is borne but of low degree
Ye say to me the deed to be to me more shame
By your saying as seems unto me
Fortune and not Guystarde ye do now blame
Unworthy men which brings to great fame
And they that be worthy of great renome
She keeps low under her fell thraldom
Of one man we took our orygynall
Virtue makes man to be excellent
whose deed is good him noble men may call
Though your saying thereto do not assent
But ygnorant men think by their Judgment
He is noble that is of great estate
Though their manners be worthy for to hate
The deeds of your nobles remember
And the manners of Guystarde therwithall
Certes if ye will justly consydre
Of nobleness he shall be special
Noble unnoble either ye may call
Their birth and manners are full contrary
From nobleness they greatly do vary
I take record thereof of your report
Whom ye have praised so excellently
Of your affyrmynge I took great confort
His virtue ye so much did magnyfy
And without I am dysceyued truly
There is no praise to him attrybuted
But that he has it full well deserved
If he be poor yet he is excellent
His noble virtue does enhaunce his name
His youth in your service has long spent
If he be poor thereof ye be to blame
with richesse ye might have raised his name
Promocyon he has deserved full well
Pouerte does not gentylnesse expel
And where ye be in ambyguyte
How ye may do to punysshe mine offense
Of the said doubt I will make your heart fre
To punysshe Guystarde if ye do pretense
Upon me execute the same sentence
I was the cause that he did the trespace
If that he dye I coueyte not your grace
Death I fere not nor life I would obtain
But of Guystarde if ye take not mercy
Though ye would me spare I shall not refrain
But of my self take vengeance cruelly
And if we have deserved for do dye
Upon us both accomplysshe your pleasure
For after him my life shall not long dure
Robert Coplande to the constauncy in love of Sygysmonde.
O Constant lady / O light of lovers shene
O turtle true / thy lover so absent
what might thou more / tha^ with courage clean
Offer thy self / to death most vyolent
For thy Guystarde / which has his Judgment
Alas my pen / for ruthe sorrow does quake
Only for ruthe / that I have for thy sake
Alas sweet woman / thou loved not for mede
Nor yet in comune / but steadfastly to one
which secret was in word / thought and deed
And never loved but only the alone
Alas what sorrow / now that he is gone
Does the compass / standing all in dread
Herynge him judged / to death by fyers Tancrede
Will none excuse / thy faders heart relent
And thou his child / O nature most untrue
Alas me think I se the here present
Berayned with teres / and asshy deedly hew
Thou do^st not pray this favor to eschew
But hardyed in love / making thy Judgment
wenynge thereby / his heart for to relent
Finis.
How Guystarde was taken out of prison and his heart cut out of his body / and
sent in a cup of gold to Sygysmonde.


THis prince pceyuy^ge his daughters courage
Thought not yt she would her saying fulfill
But from her chamber he took his passage
To sle his daughter it was not his will
But Guystarde he determined to kill
After whose death he thought she would refayne
Forgetting the love that was with them twain
He commanded them that did keep the Iayle
To strangle Guystarde by his fell judgment
Secretly in the night they should not fail
And from his body his heart they should rent
And there withal they should do him present
whose commandment they durst not dysobey
But executed it without delay
Tancrede in a cup of gold put the heart
And by a secret servant he it sent
Unto his daughter with this message smert
Saying your father sends you this present
That you should take conforte is his intent
Of that which ye loved best in your mind
whom ye have found so steadfast true and kind
But Sygysmonde after her father was gone
Out of her chamber her mind to fulfill
To the gardyne she went secret alone
And gadred veynymous herbs to still
where with she might her self suddenly kill
If Guystarde were slain as she did suppose
Than by that venym her self she would lose
But after this message was to her told
She took the cup with a sad countenance
The heart therein sadly she did behold
She pondred within her remembrance
That it was his heart she had no dowtaunce
wherefore she said unto the messangere
These words following with heavy chere
Certain my father has well consydred
This noble heart is not worthy to have
Other sepulture to be entyred
For in a cup of gold should be his grave
So great a gift he never to me gave
with great thanks have me recommended
For his kyndnesse can not be deserved
R. Coplande by exclamacyon to Tancrede in executynge tyranny.
OVte on the tyrant / O cruel Trancrede
what have thou done / fury to commyt
Behold Guystarde wtouten heart here blede
woe worth thy dome / and hasty shyttle wit
Outrage alas how is thy reason quyt
Only but death / fie out alas for woe
No prison / banysshment / nor punysshynge but so
Thou have not regarded the words of thy child
Nor her answers / with promysse desperate
But in anger thou have / thy self begylde
Now to repent / thou shall it find to late
Ase what comes of domes abreuyate
But repentance / O fool insapyent
Of folysshe Judge / an hasty judgment
With death of one / thou thought to have the other
Thou lesest both / and all with hastynesse
True love of death is the very mother
Record of Dido / as Vyrgyll does express
Dyanyra / Isyphyll / and Lucresse
with many other which at this time Ispare
And now by the is come these lovers share
Finis.
How Sygysmonde dyed after the heart of Guystarde was sent to her.


THe said messengere with this did depart
Sygysmonde holding the cup tenderly
with her lyppes often kyssed the heart
Replenysshed with teres aboundauntly
with face pale for woe and melancoly
Beholdynge it with deedly countenance
In this wise she wayled the woeful chance
O noble heart the pleasant hospytall
Of my desire which by great cruelte
Have fynysshed for me thy life mortal
To know thy death it had suffysed me
Though with mine eyes I did it not se
But me think it is to me agreeable
Thou have thy grave to the conuenable
At thy last departing there lacked naught
But the teres of thy lover so fre
Yet god has put within my fathers thought
Thy heart he has sent hyder unto me
To fornysshe them at this thine obseque
He knew it loved me specially
But with dry eyes I did think for to die
I can desire no better company
Than thy noble heart at my departing
For to the it is right necessary
To have knowledge of my life the ending
By soul with thine to be is desiring
Ensemble that they may go their passage
where pleases god to their last pilgrimage
These words said she did declyne her eye
Upon the cup wherein the heart was laid
Like a river she wept haboundauntly
But noise or cry she did not out brayde
As women be wont but with mind dysmayde
Full often she kyssed there the deed heart
Complaining on fortune false and pervert
Her gentyl women being there present
what the heart sygnyfyed they did marvel
And wherefore she did so greatly lament
And for pity they did weep and wayle
Prayenge her to make to them rehersayle
The cause wherefore she made so much sorrow
But in no wise of her they might it know
And when she had wept suffycyently
She dried her eyes and ceased her weeping
And to the heart she said thus pyteously
O noble heart best beloved of all thing
The office of love I make now ending
For time it is that I should follow the
By cruel death thy fellow for to be
This said she drank the poison without fere
And on her bed down her self she laid
The deed heart to hers she held hard and nere
Abiding her death without noise or brayd
The maidens of this being sore afraid
Suspectynge the drink and lamentacyon
To Tancrede thereof they made relacyon
Her father of this was greatly meued
For he fered his daughters fell courage
That her self with some thing had grieved
To her chamber he took fast his passage
But the poison no medycyne could assuage
wherefore he syghed and wept asperly
Complaining his daughters hard desteny
She prayed him to cease so for to rave
And that he of his extreme charity
would burye her and Guystarde in one grave
And for she living suffered might not be
Secret to use famylyaryte
That after her death she vncouertlye
Might be laid by him where so he did lie
Tancrede for woe and sorrow could not speak
Sygysmonde feeling death to approach fast
And that her eye strings began to break
She badde them all farewell with mind steadfast
with that her soul out of her body past
The heart full hard she held until her breast
Until that death her life had over pressed
Thus the love of these lovers fynysshed
Tancrede after his woeful heaviness
In one sepulture them both entered
within the cite of Salerne doutlesse
Full like a prince with great pomp and richesse
To these two lovers Jesus of his grace
Grant mercy and in heaven to have a place. Amen.
The lenuoy of R. Coplande.
GO tragedy unto thy translatoure
Bewail to hy^ thy chance unfortunate
If ought be amys / thine impressoure
In addycyon / or sense myslytterate
Pray him of help / thy fautes to castygate

Pardon of mysmakynge / gladly thou him pray
And him require / according to promys
His book to acheue / he knows mine intent
which is of substance worth many of this
And more worthy / of matter excellent
How be it with this I do right well assent
That he with Pamphletes many does occupy

And if thou hap to reimpressyon
Desire them / the which shall be the cause
Though thou be ill / that no transgressyon
By them nor theyrs / be made in any clause
Correccyon / I agree / but there a pause
Follow your copy / and let thamendynge alone
He may ill mende two tongues that can but one
None be the masters / that with me will dele
Than beware / my little book I pray
From boys / and lerners / lest they thy trowthe stele
And holly thy fautes / unto me lay
Show forth thy matter / what ever that they say
Of love / folly / fortune / hastynesse / and shame
Unto thine auctour / and not to me the blame
And unto them / which chayned be in love
Show example / of wylfull appetyte
Order each where / their courages to move

Give council / to leave sensual delight
Take the as myrrour / such danger to ensewe
By harm of other / they may the same eschew.
