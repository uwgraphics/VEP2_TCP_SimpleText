To the faithful Christians.
When the Gentiles heard the Law, they gave this testimony of the Jews, in
that behalf, Deuteronomy. 46.
Only this people is wise, and prudent. No marvel: for, Psalm. 19. 7.
The Law gives wisdom to the simple. Psalm. 19. 7.
It is perfect: For Deuteronomy. 6. 25.
it is our righteousness before the Lord. Pro. 3. 8, 9.
It is also plain to him that will understand. Then seeing these Laws are
Deuteronomy. 10. 4.
Ten, and Deuteronomy. 5. 22.
God added no more: Deu. 12. 32.
Neither must we put any thing to them. Every Psalm. 119. 96.
Commandment must of force be exceeding broad. The means to understand their
breadth, Moses has set down, when he said: Exodus 20. 1.
Then GOD SPOKE all these words.

The word, SPEAK, is to proclaim with majesty: when then he spoke All;
there is like majesty in All. Then, what majesty is in any one Commandment,
is to be translated into every one of the rest. Remember to keep the Saboth:
yea we must remember to keep every Law. Have no other Gods before his face:
yea, do all that is right, and no evil in his sight. Honor thy Father and
Mother, that thy days may be longs yea, keep all the Laws, that thy days may
be prolo^ged. Once in deed, in the Law, for brevity is set one majesty, where
soonest it would be missed: not for once; but to be translated into every one,
as Moses does, where he expounds the ten Commandments. For the ease of those
that hunger after righteousness, I have digested the Commanmentes in this Table.
Meditat, and so may you profit, that you may (in a manner) reduce the whole
moral scriptures to these ten Commandments; not without a singular delight to
him that loves knowledge. Enjoy this, and study it a while; and shortly (God
willing) I will further help you herein, by a most familiar explanation.

Christ's unworthy minister, that desires your edification. W. S.
