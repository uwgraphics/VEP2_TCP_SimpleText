THE RETVRNE OF the Knight of the Post from Hell, with the Devils answer to
the Supplication of PIERCE PENILESSE, with some Relation of the last Treasons.

Omnia praeclara rara,

LONDON Printed by John VVindet for Nathaniel Butter. 1606.

To all Favorers of Learning or the Learned.
ABout some ten years agone, when the Supplication of Pierce Pennilesse was
published; the Gentleman who was the author thereof, being mine intimate and
near companion, as one with whom I communicated both my love, mine estate,
and my studies, and found ever out of his disposition an equal, or if postible
a more fervent sympathy of look community and affection, so as I can not choose
but still take much delight in his memory; would many times in his private
conference with me, unfold his determination touching the concluding and
finishing up of that moral and w(...) Treatise, which for as much as it
could bear no second part by the same title (as heepublikelie did protest in
an Epistle to the Printer ioynde to the same treatise) his resolution was to
accomplish his desire by writing the return of the Knight of the Post, and
therein did many times at large, discourse the maine plot and drift, wherein he
meant to bestow great art, wit and laborious study. Now death who many
times by an in charitable or cruel Anticipation preuenteth those deseignes,
which might administer much matter of regard and commodity, by taking him too
earelie from the world, who had he lived, would have enricht it with much
wittiness, left that vneffected, which had it been by him taken in hand,
would doubtless have satisfied many learned expectations. Now my self who
ever challenged most interest in his love, and nearest alliance to his
counsels, seeing the turbulencie of this last age, and the frantike madness
where with the Devil infecteth the minds of most traiterous and wicked persons,
I took in hand (albeit as unfit as Patrocles for Achilles armor) to finish up
what he in former times had intended, wherein if I have neither the witty
pleasantnes of his conceits, nor the gaulye bitterness of his pens sharpenes,
to the first imagine me of a more solid and dull composition less affected to
delight and variation of humors, and to the latter think it is a bo^d whereto I
have bound my self ever since my first nativity, rather to wish my self
dumb then by foul speech, uncomely parables, or fantastical taxations to win
either public note, or else brutish commendations, and ifin this I have
either pre uented or unwittingly taken in hand that which peradventure some far
better Genius may think fit to bestow upon some of their well labored hours,
let mine inacquaintance, ignorance, and the reasons before repeated be mine
excuses, and let the^ follow on their learned determinations, with this
encouragement, that mine as a foil has no ambition, but to give lusture to
their more pure Diamondes.

THE RETVRNE of the Knight of the Post from Hell, with the Devils answer to
Pierce Penilesse Supplication.
Having consumed the beginning of Incredibilis (...) caecitas homin^ etc. Aug.
my youth with vanity, and the latter end with hope, finding in the first,
the error of nature, in the latter the weakness of mine own judgment, willing
to recover past losses with present thri^tfulnes, I betook my self to a more

course of (...), which being suitable to mine vnambitious spirit, as not
promising any unweeldie advancement, yet did it show me assured grounds, how I
might attain to a certain comp^tencie, which ever was the greatest height of
my natural covetousness: this to effect with such substantial and sound
workemanshippe, as might both withstand the fury of present storms, and the
rutuating of after consuming Time, I began and stained the bu^^ding of my
fortunes, upon the fairest, the goodliest, and once the strongest colombe of
this Kingdom, by whose support I risse to all that I desired: for my desire
was no more, Heureux est ui la, qui plus en ne desire
then by it I enjoyed: but behold, whilst my blind contentment seducing my
more blind affections, made me forget this Philosophy, that under the Sun,
there is nothing immorta^l, and that Times works, like Penelopes web, are

done and undone, made to day, and to morrow defaced: I know not whether they
were blind Moales, or fearful Conyes, politic Fo^es, or flattering
Badgers, but surely all or some of them envying the beauty of so goodly a
Pyramedde (whose plain luster defaced others counterfeite bright^esse, and
whose well fashioned strength might have supported the Counsel Chamber of
Princes) by a tedious and long labored undermining at length overthrew him into
the foul muddy lake of most detested Lethe, with whose fall my self was
undone, and many others perished: blame ra ^ument ia, nigrescunt ^guine venae,

me not, if I toare my hair, beat my breast, cursed my birth, talkt^ to the
air, and like a mad man forswore all mediocrisie in my moanes, when I saw the
expense of a double Prentishippe, rewarded with this altogether undone Fortune,
my passion augmented my frenzy, and my frenzy (though confusedly, and without
proportion) calde up into my remembrance all the accountes of mine own
stupiditie and blockishnes, as having not formerly either armde my self
against these general evils of mankind, or else by a daily expectation, have
beheld no more then for what I continually waited, but when the weariness of
my troubled thoughts began to take some rest, through better consideration,
and that I beheld my self like an orphan, left to the world hopeles and
comfortles building new castles in the air, and strange Eutopian
commonwealthes in my fantastical brain, found at length both by mine own
experience, and others judgments such crosses, such calamities, and such
irresistable miseries in all the courses of life to which man can any way
either dispose himself, or his meditatio^s, that like the offspring of ^iobe, I
became a weeping stone, having no sense in me, but insensible coldness riguisie
ma* Ovid.
whereupon willing to impart some part of my cogitations, I began in verse to
write after this manner.

Say gentle Muse, what course of life is best,
Envy wounds Courts, a country life wantes rest, ^od vitae se^^ iter? si na
tumultu ^soni^.

Trauell's uncertain, and where there is no stay,
There grief begets as long a weary day,
The merchants loss makes loathsome his delight,
And poverty despised breeds spite:
Toil makes the Plowmans sorrows to surmount,
And shipwreck makes the sea of no account,
The single life is chainde to foreign pains,
Yet marriage of more greater cares complains,
And hardly keeps his chaste bed in chaste plight:
But fears the day, and wakes the jealous night,
The work of usury is base and ill,
It gauls the rich, and does the poor man kill.
To every age there does one care belong,
And no man likes the life he leads long,
The sucking babe wants sense of good or ill,
And children take instruction against their will:
Wild youth with rashness overthrows all,
Wisemen by fortune, war or sea do fall,
Whilst wrath, deceit, and labor linkt together,
Transform themselves to pains more great the^ either
Old age, long wished, and woone by vows and prayers
Infirmities both waste; torment and tears,
We all things present, commonly despise:
Some hate the Gods, the while Iuturna cries,
Why was I made immortal? Oh and why
Has death no power on me, that I may die?
Prometheus bound to Caucasus complains,
And calls the heavens to witness of his pains,
And Jove the king of Gods most deeply blames,
For putting life immortal in base frames,
VVaigh well the virtues of the mind, then see,
How they torment us, did not chastity,
Undo Hypolitus: yet still mark this,
There Is none lines well, that leads loose life amiss,
Witness those Kings whose faults we dare discuss
Nice Sardanapalus, bawdy Tereus,
The treble punicke war^e ^^^y teach us shun,
To be forsworn, and yet Saguntos won,
By true faith keeping that untimely end,
Which l^ane-fa^d-famine hatefully does send,
To honor friendship, or to live by friends,
That brought Pythagoras sect unto their ends,
Fear this and live in ^ate with all thou meets,
For that was Tymon stand in Athens streets.
Ever the mind does disagree and find,
Doubts and distrustes, that overthrow the mind:
Then let none covet for the things we crave,
We still refuse, and yet as feign would have,
Some wish for honor, and repent the same,
Some long for rule, and a commanding name,
And so they may control, they are pleased to be,
As serving slaves unto indignity;
But unto honors hie top-gallant brought,
The sting of envy parts not from their thought,
Some study night and day for golden speech,
Yet in their lives to no one grace does reach,
The Advocate that pleades the guilty; cause,
The adverse Chent hates and his laws,
The Client of the Advocate is scornde,
Because his ill is by his mouth adornde.
Some would be Fathers, but their childrens ill,
Makes the^ with grief wish they were childles still*
Yet he that wants an heir is made a pray,
To these that gape to bear his goods away.
Who sparing lives, and hordeth up his pelf,
Lines still the scorn of men, and of himself,
Yet he that all spends, always shall obtain,
An unthrifts name, the worse disgrace of twain,
By strange mishappes, what euers in this round,
Is contrary in his own working found,
Then best the sentence of the gre^ke to try,
Or not to be, or being soon to die.
After I had in this rude manner rymed out my Cura leaves loq^^^tur inge^tus

passions and as it were discharged mine afflicted mind of much woe by this
former meditation, I began to toss my thoughts up and down a thousand
several ways, and to think with my self what new course were best for mine
un dertaking, the loss of my former time made m^e loathe service, distrust the
wars, and fear the court, as being too old for bondage, tos poor to buy
prefexment, and too plain by flattery to gain advancement, wherefore finding
my self unfit for those things to which most men fit all their dispositions,
I began to look into my self and to the sto^ke from whence I was derived,
where I found my pedigree was not obscure, nor my disc^nt vngentill, but what
avails high mat ches unto low means: hence I began to lock into what mine
ancestors had left behind them, and I found that their providence left enough
both to renown their names and inriche their posterity, to part of which I
knew my self might both by the laws of God and nature iustlye challenge a
title, upon which gauel^kind estate prese^^ing, I instantly resolved to forsake
the cit^ie, and wholly to betake my self to a country habitation, where living
poorly I might yet live In solis ^is tibi turba locis
contentedly, which having done and framed in my self every thing suitable to
the course I intended, being at my first ariual ravished with the homely
delights of the country, I could not forbear to write in verse this country
conunendation.

Dear blessed woods lone walks, and fruitful plains, Ca re sclue ate e^o^,
etc, Guarin^

The truest harbourers of peaceful rest,
The willingness that in my soul remains,
To see you by my homecome is expressed,
And if my stars will destenye my fate,
To lead a life conformed to my will,
I will not change you for a cities state,
A Princes court, or for the muses hill,
For if we note these mortal goods aright,
They are no other then our evils are,
He holds the least who most has in his sight:
And who has most has nothing to his share,
Riches they are not but intangling toils,
Wherein the liberty of men turmoiles.
What boots the gloss of honor in young years,
Or fame, or virtue, or in mortal blood,
That heavenly strains of Noblenes appears,
All heavens graces and the earthes best good,
What boots these large and these fair pleasant woods,
Rich plains, and flocks more rich upon them pent,
And if amongst so many earthly goods,
The heart be still excluded from content.
O happy shepherd thou that safely sleeps,
In a pure gown (though poor) yet ever free,
Whose self is all thy riches, and who keeps,
But natures fair, thy fair to beutifie,
That knows not how ambition does torment,
But living poorly lives the more content
Thou that in poverty no poorness knows,
Nor feels the strange difeases of the rich,
But holds thine own through which thy wishes
Thou art not wonded by enjoying much, (shows)
Thou that do spurn at bug bear dignity,
With Natures gifts; the gifts of nature feeding,
Milk with selfe-milke reuiu'de and with the Be
Preserues pure natures sweets from sweetness needing
The Fount wherein thou drinkst, thou bathste alone
And it is evermore thy Counsel giver,
If thou be well, the world wants cause of moan,
For there can never be a juster liver.
Was never borrowed beutye to thee lent,
But liueing poorly thou live more content*
In vain from thee, the heavens are hid in clouds,
Or armde with thunder most maleuolent,
Thy simple thoughts no fear or horror shrowdes,
Sune shine and showers, breed thee like content
Thy country life is free from heaviness,
No care within thy hearts dear closset lies
Thy flock (thy charge) seeds on the tender grass,
Whilst thou feedst still, thy true love with thine eyes,
Not her whom men or stars to thee assign,
But her alone, that love unto thee gave,
Who among th'adorned plants of myrtil twine
By you renownde, each others pleasures have
Where other choice, breeds satallie lament,
You living poorly live the more content,
Nor for thee feels she that bright fire of love,
Which thou shall not both know and easily see,
Nor thou that heat, within her shall not move;
For both being poor, you both contented be.
O life which knows not how to die til death,
would I with thee might change my state or breath.
But after I had in the country spent many years, expecting much, but
obtaining nothing, and found that the tenor in our Northern parts, was a
mere contrary, to the charitabie Custom of thrice happy Kent, this unequal
Fee-simple, allotting younger Brothers but the simple see of contempt and
Beggerie, when I say I saw those, whose only fortunes, were but to exchange a
sonie trencher, ride before a Cloke-bagge, or but carry a sword and vnckler
out-scrippe me, and out-braue me (by an unequal distribution) even with that
patrimony, for part of which doubtless I was once created, yea when I saw
nature her self, (whom Philosophy had made the excellent mystres of all
things,) now become the vg^est monster of all ages, serpent like devouring up
the issue of her own bowels: when I saw neglect in parents, tyranny in
Brethren, and contempt in kinsfolk, when I saw fools a advanced, Philosophers
despised, strangers feasted children starued, gold enough to purchase toys,
charity too little, ever to enter heaven, when I saw Monkeis cherisht in
mothers lappes, while Children cride for want of cradles, new fashions purchased
with all unmodestie, old manors sold to maintain thriftlesnes when all this I
saw, what could I do but cry,

O hommum mores, O gens, O tempora dura,
Quantus in vrbe dolor, quantus in orb dolus.
And in that passion comparing the City and Country together, and finding
them of suitable ilnes, I resolved with Astopho, that since there was no better,
and that as Machiuell holds, we must necessarily conueise with the evil, that
it was my best to choose the best of evils, whereupon dischargeing my hopes, and
praying for my persecutors, I packt vtque in s^ sua per vestigia voluitur ano^s
Virg.
up my baggage, and made a maine back again for the City, which how ever
ch^^den by the Puritanise, the Humorist, or the Satyrist yet in mine experience
I found it more charitable then the Country Uulgarist but my horse was no
sooner arrived within the pr(...)ts of ^hordich, where bounty is so super
abundant, that men may command bodies, as fast as the devil desires souls:
when I beheld at every door a weapon, at every streets end a guard, and at
every gate a petty regiment, I could not choose but wonder and presage that
some notable, famous and vnweakeable villainy should be the occasion of this
severe and diligent carefulnes, yet again remembering with my self, that since
the blessed coming of his most excellent Majesty, I had not beheld the City
government: I half supposed that this strict observance was grounded upon some
strayt^r ruling the vulgar multitude: so that loath to discharge mine own
ignorance, I ^oroare to make inquiry o. that I most desired to understand, the
rather since I beheld the generality thereof, which was equal^^e demeaned
through the whole City: in the end coming into Powles, to behold the old
Duke and his guests, and to see if great Christophers rome were not equaled
with nob e Francis and famous Philips Tomb: I beheld, all things after the
old fashion, in the end walking down into the great market place of confused
discourses, I had not taken above two or three turns ere I observed this: that
generally all men, whose talk I could ouer-heare, seemed only to discourse of
one Subject, praising God, that had revealed a must horridde, and not to be
imagined treason, and biterly cursing those monsters and monstrous men, whose
^^uelish brains could contriue a damnable Project, worse then ever the Devil
himself dreamde of, at least much worse then ever was thought of in former
ages* for no religion could cloak it, no Atheizme could maintain it, nor
could any revenge be imagined of so infinite and damnable greatness, for the plot
made no respect of Gods anointed, no conscience of his elect nor no care of
many thousand innocents: as having only this end to bring the most fluorishing
empire of the world to a most sad, woeful, and eternal desolation: this
universal discourse as I gathered here and there a word, and ioynde them
together in mine own thoughts, made even my hair, rise with the terror
thereof, yet insomuch as I could not get a perfect understanding of the
matter in my walking up and down, I much more diligently looked about, to see it
I could discern any of mine acquaintance, of whom I might enquire, the truth
of this hyddcous conspiracy: but my long absenc^ had robbed me of old
acquaintance: From the great wal^e I went to the Usurers alley, where having
taken a turn or two, I might perceive the argument of the tie in the hundred,
and the coos^ning the law, with an o^^e stale ^ricke of the life of a stranger
was quite laid aside, and the bringing of the Lumbard out of Germany, into
England was quite forgotten, and they as the former (though for merlie they had
never reioycste at any man's (...)) now were infinitely well pleased with the
discou^ri^ of the execrable conspiracy, but ^ull my self was not bettered in
mine own knowledge. From thence I went into the Intelligencers gallerie, where
the Proteousles of this age hold their conuenticle, men that change their
religions a^ ost as the Merchants wife her smocks, that had seuenscore for her
shift, and esteem more of a Spanish Crusado, or a French sous, then either of
the allegiance to which they are bound by nature, or of honesty which should
make them acceptable in men's society: these men albeit they are no better in
reputation then common executioners, and that all their Proiectes have but
these ends, either to entangle, or strangle, yet as I might over hear some
odd parcels, of their broken Spanish, Italian, and French Apotheges, I found
(O miracle) a certain contyence in them, with a bitter detestation, and
hateful condemning of the former practice. Now whether it were Envy in them,
that the Devil should select worse Agents then themselves, or that grace being
not utterly banished, touched them with the thought of such bestiall
unnaturalness, I know not, but certain it is they like wise condemned the
invention, and reioy^st at the prevention, which when I noted, I was much more
enflamed then ever I was before to understand the substance, the rather when I
considered, how God and good men fools and fantastickes, slaves and villains,
and even all sorts of people, from the ^est to the worst, joined in one
general, applauding Gods mercies, that had brought to light a treason of such
not to be imagined monstrousnes: whereupon looking up and dawne at last, I
espied a fellow with a hunger staruedlooke and an envious gesture, with a
threede-bare cloak, and an half but^onde doublet, with a neck almost ru^les,
and a waste all girdlesse, with torn breeches, and vngarterd stockinges, his
shoes cut, and his toes uncovered: this fellow me thought as he walkte more
discontentedly the^ the rest, so did he in my conceit, use more serious and
b^sie action to himself then any other, and albeit he was alone, yet did he
use such earnest demonstrations, as if he had been declaiming before a
multitude: to him I went, and privileged by the baseness of his habit at the
first I askte him what news he heard in the City; why (said he) are you
such a stranger, that you hear not the news; truly, answered I, I am but
newly come to the City, and have not as yet heard of any passadges: why quoth
he) the Parliament House, the Kings Majesty, the Queen the Prince of Wales,
the Lords spiri tual and Temporal, the Commons of the Kingdom, and all that
either had attended them, or come to behold the^, should this day have been
blown up with Gunnepowder: Now, the Lord in Heaven defend quoth I (and
withal started back:) what? has there been seen any visible Devils abroad,
that should have acted that ugly tragedy, for sure no man or mankind could
either have the brains to contriue, or the hands to execute such an h^^ride
and inhumaine treason: But (said he) Devil me no denils, they may hereafter
through judgment prove Devils, but as yet they are men, which both contriude,
and should have executed: Have you, (quoth I) heard any of their names* their
names (replied he) why: I am of familiar acquaintance with them all, he that
should have executed, and was like wise a contriuer, was one Guy do Faulkes.
The especial Plotte-layer, was Thomas Piercy, Robert Catesby, the two VVinters,
John Wright, Christopher Wright, and din^rs others: truly (answered I) you
do but delude me, for these sellowes, were of such under quality, and so
sarre from hope of advancement, by the ^u^uersion of the commonwealth, that
except all ^entrie should be rooted out, and nothing left but their families: I
see not which way they should have raisde their fortunes one step higher: ^s
for Faukes I never bearde his name before, for Percie, I knew him long since,
at what time he was reputed a good honest geutleman seruingma^, one that ^urst
fight, and had fought many t^l frayes, by which means he got love amongst men,
and credit with his Lord and Master, but for any estate worthy to bring him
into the eye of the common wealth, or for any wisdom worthy to be called
into a common counsel or for any sinceriti^ in religion, fit to be a lantherne
to others pathe^ they were attributes then as far from him as he by this
plotte is far from a good christian, there was in him a ^alure which had it
not been estrangde from virtue might well have brought him to account, but
never to the office of a crown bestowing.

Now for Catesby, I had also some knowledge of him too, whom many men esteemed
in times pastfor a gentilman of a good frank nature, and of a sociable
disposition, one that could well tell how to set up a rest at primero, or to
throw a pair of Dice out of his hardes with the best comelines. But for
me^ling with matters of estate or alteration of kingd^s, I never knew any fool
so mad, as to hope of advancement by his fortunes. Yet this in ^haritie I must
say of him, he had a secret greatness of ^pitit which had it like wise had no
acquaintance but virtue, might have deser^d much good both of his King and
Country: as for VVinters they were me^ like Faukes out of my ^llement therefore
I think of them as of the^e de^d^, that they are the worst of past and present
remembrance, but for the two VVrights, though they were men with wh^ I had
little or no acquainia^ce: yet were they men of whom I have heard many vild
discourses and therefore likely to be the ministers of evil, The elder of the^
was infinitely proud, yet not so proud as ungrateful, for being v^terlye
without any certain meares more then the revenue of other men's purses, yet was
his general ostentatio^ that he was beholden to no man. His virtue was a good
oily tongue, that with easy utterance beguild many weak attentions and a
formal corriage which contemning others heapt upon himself a self
commondations, his usual boast was that he scornd felt hats, he loud dublets
lined with taffat^ ^^nen of twenty shillings an elle, silk stockings, never v^
d^r twenty angels in his pocket, and his horseat least of fortic pou^^
reckoning, this being wrought only by cifers I scarde would ever in the end
bring upon him the Romo^ judgment Detur carnifici, and the rather in that I
knew his youth was loose and adulterate, his middle age proud and contemptuous,
and therefore his end like to be desperate and treacherous: for the younger
Wright, he was in show blockish, and clownish, in disposition currish, and as
his samiliars reported, by faculty theeuish, so that he was ofter carractred
in my Lord chief Justices records, then in the callender of those that should
mark men for good employment.

Now these things considered, I can but wonder and stand amazed, that such
worms as these should go about to undermine so glorious and strong a
government, the ruins whereof, could not choose but trus^ them into many
pieces, but the Dinel whose time is but short, more extremely rages. And this
last Iron age, must of necessity be the mother of Monsters, mischiefs and
prodigies. Why (replied this threede-ba^e fellow,) Do you hold this Position,
that Poverty is no fit Agent for villainy, at^s you are much dece^ued, they
are the only cornerstones on which the devil ^^ecteth his Empire, for to
them, he preposeth wealth, glory and advancement, the only contraries to their
fortunes: and what does man Communi vitio naturae vt inuisis, latitantibus

naturally most covet, but what he most wants: again, where shall you find
more pride then in beggars, more contempt then in slaves, and more revenge then
in weakness,: O you are too simple, if you th^nke not these men fit for
massacre. I hearing him talk thus, began to look somewhat strangely upon
him, and demanded of him what he was, and of whence, that being so disorderly
attired, could so fubtlely order his words: I am (quoth he) to tell you truly
both in essence and nature a spirit, which taking upon me this human shape,
run up and down to increase these mischiefs, and to enrich Hell, which is
my masters kingdom, briefly, I am a knight of the post, and that knight of the
post who about some te^ years agon co^uaide the supplication of Pierce
Pennilesse to the Devil my Master: I hearing him talk thus, took up my
hand and blessed my self, but after, casting away both fear and amazement, I
told him that I had many times read the Supplication, wherein Pierce did
describe the Knight of the Post, to be a neat ^edanticall fellow, in the
form of a Citizen, and you look (quoth I) like a ^atterde outcast, that
should hide himself from the Pronost Marshall, why Sir (said he) Think you
the Devils Factors shift their shapes no o^ter then wild Irish women their
smockes, O you are deceuied I am a Citizen, but for City occasions, as to
bail v^thriftes, to defeat creditors, to abuse justice, and to c^s^n
Innocents. I am sometimes an Attorney, sometimes a Pr^ctor, very ^lte^ a
Parrator, I have worn a Barresters gown, and when need requires, a cornerde
Cappe, I have a short furde cloak, and a pair of Spanish lether Bu^kins, I
have a suite of the best fashion, white Pumpes, and a guil^ Rapier, I have a
great scarf, a short skrine, and a pair of starcht Mutchatoes: in brief,
what can I not counterfeite, when either the Devil will have me conicatch men
of their souls, or the world of reputation. Believe me (quoth I) you are a
desperate Iugler, but since it is my fortune, to fall thus foul upon your
beggarly Knightshippe: I pray thee let us leave all former discourses, and tell
me, how thy master accepted poor Pierces Supplication, truly (replied he)
at first he was very angry, as well for troubling him in those busy times;
when he had great affairs of estate in handling, as also for so plainly
laying open the politic stratagemes, and secret de^ises, which he himself
and his seven Counselors had of so long time been in compiling for speedy
means to bring the world into his subjection, yet in the end being infinitely
solicited by my importunicie after the fashion of the world, rather to ease
himself of vexation, then for any good he intended to Pierces suit, gave me by
word of mouth this answer, which I abruptly after writing down, you may hear
read in this paper, following

The answer of the high and mighty Prince of darkness Donsel Del Lucifer,
King of Acheron Stix and Phlegeton, Duke of Tartarie, Marquess of Cocytus, and
L. high Regent of Limbo, to the Supplication of Pierce Pennilesse
THe tenor Pierce of thy supplication coming into our all confounding fingers
we could not choose but out of our damnable inclination, take bie displeasure,
both at the unreasonableness of thy dema^d and at thy too plain unfolding of
those sins, by which we advance the power of our kingdom, yet to satisfy in
some part the earnestnes of thy solicitor we have out of our inferuall
sinfulnes returned thee this answer.

For the rent thou challengest due to thine unhallowed purse, wherein I have
kept revels so long a season, I tell thee there is none due from me as never
having taken possession of the tenement, nor at any time delighted in such vast
unfurnished places, for I tell thee how ever blindness by my suggestion has
persuaded, yet is there not any place wherein I am better entertained, or
bestow my malediction in greater abundance, then amongst the infinite he apes
of idolatrous Crosses: therefore I may not suffer my servant Avarice to
disfurnishe my Treasury, till bringing a certificat from my public notarie
despair he witness thee apt for villanye, and then I will not only take the
advantage of those usurping Cormorants which without letters pattentes take
upon them my highest offices, but by a secret way which leads unto damnation
bring thee to hear the conference of Gold my all prevailing orator. I know
there be a great sort of good fellows that would swim through ale and
blood, and many needy lawyers that mourn in thryed-bace gowns that would
forswear speaking either true latin or true law, so they might com to be
Goldes acquaintance. But I tell thee Pierce it may not be, least having what
they desire, they being glutted leave to desire what I would have them: or gold
being too generally made the slave ^^ slaves leave his power of enchanting
great persons: therefore I think it fit to straiten some part of his former
liberty and by the extremity of his absence make men run mad for his
presence, so that the very hope of him shall be prized above a soules-fafetie,
for which purpose I have sent new directions to my servant Greedines and to his
assistants Famine, Lent, and Desolation, that they shall be more severe in their
government, and less prodigal of the liberty of gold then formerly they have
been. I will have them teach the world, as Courtiers do Fa^tastiques that the
only fashion and beutie of this age is to be immoderately miserable, and to
make Bounty and Hospitality of vilder reputation then a great bellid dublet,
or a pair of vnbombasted venetians. Attili^s Regulus*
I will have them teach Generals of armies, yt it is better to forsake there
charges, then to endure the loss of a plow share, or a horse teame, I will have
them teach consuls that Cato the elde^.
it is better to sell their horses then provide prouender: that to travel a
foot shows strength, to ride sloth, that a gown of freeze is warmer then a
robe of scarlet: I will have them teach Emperors that small trains are great
treasures, and that honorable and full courts are but Scipio A Emilianus.

unrespected, least if he be advanced my kingdom be consumed, generally I will
have them ere the dissolutio^ of the world make every thing worse then it was
in the time of the old sages, for recompense where of I will cloth my servant
Greedines in Monopoles, Morgages the lands of Orphans and the livings of
Churches: yet I tell thee my poor Pennilesse supplicator I will not be so
infinite in my tyranny, but that gold my prisoner shall have some recreation,
and at great feasts and pageant-playes lighten out the glory of his beutie,
nor will I keep him so utterly without the comfort of society, but that he
shall ever have one of the seven pillars of my throne to be his playmate, and
sometimes attendant even Pride, which as thou say reigns in the heart of
the Court, and The seven deadly sins
peruerteth all virtue, shall not only assist Greediness in this design, but
shall so far exceed in all inhumane pride
and incomprehensible ostentation, that her former monumentes, and her former
unnatural ambitions shall be rekoned as types and shadows of great humility,
alas thy silly chothier shall be but the cipher of an vpstart, who being
nursed in Tauernes, taught in Brothelles, and The vpsta^te
confirmde in Theaters, shall so quickly be discovered by the eye of the
i^dicious, that brought into contempt by the weakness of his own demean^r, he
shall be able to enrich my Kingdom with nothing more then his own hanging.
There must be in this decrepednes of the worlds age, vpstartes of an other
condition, those on whom Nature has bestowed excellent benefits, as a comely
form, a ripe wit, and a civil, or an vnambitious disposition, whom
Education has made learned, ro^merce, beloved, and observation full of perfect
judgment: Upon these shall Pride show the power of her Internal D^^tie: Into
these shall she i^spue such a ^enome of self affection, that being hood
winkt with the follye of imaginary greatenes, they shall transport all their
actions beyond the lymits of Piety or reason, accusing and condemning all
present things, as either government or fortunes, and only fix and amuse
their cogitations upon future actions, Hope, Fear and Desire, Calamitosus est
animus futuri anxius: Sen.
drawing into their minds this Position, that to doubt of what is to came, is
to be ac^rtainde of present sorrow. Hence shall it proceed, that they shall
raze out of their remembrances, this Philosophy, Know thy self, and follow
thy business, which comprehen^ing all duty, makes men leave other men's
business, to think of their own actions and not to correct, but to be well
chastisde: but they giving loose raynes unto Folly, shall live unsatisfied with
all things, till the world impouerisht, can boast of nothing, but chiefly of
this, that it is not virtuous: nay so far shall Pride exhale and draw them
up unto omnipotent ilnes, that when they shall with their own euilseeing
eyes behold the vilnes of their wicked passages, yet shall they seek to
glorify themselves in their deaths strangenes, which how ever it be odious to
God and his Angels, yet shall it be to them pleasant, in that the like
wickedness has not been before repeated: insomuch that like the dying
Frenchman, neither looking backewarde to sin, nor forward to salvation: they
shall in their last gasp expect nothing but a tumultuous Funeral.

Besides, to such weakness shall the Pride of their own thoughts bring them,
that like him that exceedingly troubled with the stone, being forbidden the
taste of sli^^y and gross meats in the extreamitie of his worst fittes, sound
ease in railing against milk, cockles, and carbanadoes: so they for aspiring
to darte mountains against ventus vt amittit vires nisi robore d^s^^ occurra ^t
s^l^ae ^p^tio diffusus (...) Lucan.
the heavens, shall find no comfort, but the acusing of their own
consciences, how ever formerly they had resolude upon this principle, That Fury
wanting a Subject, on which to be furious, is Fury of no estimation.

Thus shall their souls loose themselves in themselves and not being content
with those reasonable Objects, for which it was created, loose both the work
of advancement, and the fast hold of salvation. Pride shall make these over
weening great ones resemble fantastique Ladies, whose affections being
estraunged from those lawful and honorable objects on which they ought to be
employed, rather then they should perish in idleness to bestow them too
excessiuely on Monkeis, dogs, and parokitos deceiving the passions of the soul
by a false and uncomely object so they estranging their labors and studies
from moderation and justice, shall employ them upon building Pannonis hand
aliter post ictu^ saeuior vrsa, etc Lucan.
Castles in the air, conforming states and overthrowing Kingdoms, like brute
beasts, bitting the stone that hurt them, or appeasing their wounds by new
wounds of their own making: they shall with the Persian whippe the Sea, and
challenge mountains to combat: they shall besiege rivers, and seek reuenges
against mighty houses, nay in the end, when their actions shall be opposed
by divine providence, they shall with the profane King vow hate against the
Almighty, bind their thoughts from adoring, their tongs from speaking, and
their hearts from believing the truth of the tryple Deity: These are the
vpstartes of this last age; who having all the ornaments in which any deceit
can be covered, shall so much deceive wisdom with her antique and painted
garments that truth shall not be respected, albeit he go clad in never so
great plainnes.

Next this vpstart thou placest the beggarly and The politician.
counterfeite Politician, as a cumber to the commonwealth, whose knowledge is
but a sulien Pride, and his discontent a beggarly need^nesse, who being but a
fool by nature and a knave by practice, commonly be pernicious to none, but
men of less and weaker understanding, but there be Politicians of an other
moulde, of an other spirit, and of an other understanding, Fellows that
having got experience by observation, and understanding by much reading, that
with labor having attaind wisdom, and with well spent hours that good which
might do good to their country being ready to deliver up a fruitful harvest of
their toils shall be so corrupted with pride, that disdaining any virtuous scale
(whose strait steps shall renown the advanced) they shall hold in contempt
and derision all manner of promotion, if at one iumpe they may not sit cheek
by ioule with the highest majesty, as if princes eyes could in this tumultuous
world behold and understand men's deserts by their outward apparances: hence
shall issue the damnable proiects of treasons, murders, and subuersions, and
hence shall men forsake to be masters of their own goods, so they may be
slaves to foreign ambitions, from hence shall come the merchandise of crowns,
the sales of cities and strong fortes, the exchange of gouerme^ts, the
shipwreck of souls and alterations of religions, these are they that shall
maintain oppositions, hold intelligence with the factious, and discover the
weakness of their own cradles, and in the end having sworn themselves the
hangmen to execute all damnable judgments, shall like old hangmen bring their
own necks to the cord and dye with confusion.

What shall I do speaking of these prodigal heirs who The prodigal young
master.
like filthy weeds are no sooner sprung up but the sith is ready to crop
them, does not their lasciviousness poison their bodies as fast as their
prophanes their souls, or can the world say he sees them, ere the grave says
he has them tut they are but bubbles in water and records in sand.

And albeit the gates of hell are made much wider then they were for
entertaining there multitudes, yet does their riotes, their lusts, their
periuries and their blasphemies bring none into hell but those of their own
damned quality, the young masters that shall be of the worlds last framing,
shall be at least of the age of three score or upward. Fellows that having
par^im^^iously, basely and greedily heapt unto themselves great masses of
wealth, by usury, extortion, and all unlawful exactions, shall in the end
with the ticklings of pride have such an itch in their souls, that what with
the searching of the old records of gentrye to find a name that should sound
somewhat near to their predecessors, what with bribing of ^erraulds to confirm
and link together their genealogies, what with riotous expense to gain a
little vulgar worship amongst their neighbors, what with building princely
houses, for the monuments of their magnificence, or else what with braules and
controversies in law about the precession meare of the next Lordship they live
to consume their own hoardinges and in the end dying miserably leave a
forlorn issue which retaining the blood of their parents ambitions, become
either amongst their neighbors thieves, or amongst strangers traitors to their
King and country, these are gallants that we are somer garments on winters
body, who having ten more diseases then can be reckoned by a horselieche, think
of their lives as of their sins that they shall never be called in question.

Next these thou placest the pride of the learned, whose combats and
controversies troubles all the world pride in the learned
with their frantic disputation. Why, where were the Devils kingdom if they
were brought either to a peaceful unity, or a charitable conformity, tut
there be new seditions inuenting to keep them at an eternal enmity, so that
the weak being confounded and the ignorant missed there shall be both a
doubtfulnes of the truth, and a defense of false opinions how absurd and vilely
soever it be grounded: they shall suggest scriptures to maintain heresies and
cite the old fathers of the primitive church to defend a new sinagogue never
before this last age hard of or imagined: they shall spurn at magistracy,
and go about to confound authority, which being too strong a bulwark for
their undermining, they shall what their sharpest tools to dig down the
immortal seat of royal majesty: but when their strokes shall rebound back
into their own bosoms they shall in the furye of their prides like windy
bladders swell till they burst and become unprofitable for the meanest uses.

Another sort shall deny the reading of holy writ, the form of meditation,
the use and number of sacraments, the papists
function of the elect, the congregation of the believing, and heap such
infinite authority upon a sinful man's jurisdiction, that casting faith into
that end of the wallet which ever hangs behind them, they shall rob the great
almighty both of his true homage and alleagance and in the end when their
battery shall be able not to move one stone (...) christianity, they shall like
true soldiers of hels kingdom, practice to make such mines and vndermininges
as may blow up all truth and religion with unmerciful gunpowder, adding unto
Cattelins conspiracye and all other treasons how vilde soever great shows of
charity in comparison of their inhumanitie.

After these shall follow Herillus and his legions, who being self conceited
and over weening in their own learnings, Neuters
shallhould no heaven, no religion, nor no felicity but the rarenes of their
own knowledges, affirming it to have sufficient authority to make men wise,
happy, and virtuous, binding grace and truth within limits of their studies,
as if art being the mother of virtue, and ignorance the nurse of viciousnes,
the one could not err, nor the other attain any perfection: forgetting this
principle that God owes his extraordinary assistance unto faith and religion
and not to our passions, these are they which have justice in their mouths not
in their hearts, making religion but a show to show their other knowledges,
lending nothing to devotion, but the offices that flatter their passions making
their zeal work wonders when it assisteth their dispositions, toward
hatred, cruelty, ambition, covetousness, defamation and rebellion, but toward
piety, be nignitie and temperance it goes like the s^mmer tropique retrograde
and backward, so that religion which was made to root out vices shall by these
proselites, be made to shrowde, foster, and provoke them.

Next these shall rise up public Atheists who although Atheists.
they shall have in every affliction and danger, some feeling of the great deity
yet shall the infinite pride of their prophanes disavow the acknowledgement, and
loath to be repentant because their fa^thes are planted but by the cowardlines
of their hearts, and established by the weakness of their apprehensions,
believing only that which they believe, because they want courage not to
vnbeleeue: and feign unto themselves, that Hell and after torments are only
but shadows, and fictions, till summoned either by old age, sickness or
authority, to give an end to their breathing, they then feel that horror
which bringes them unto hell, with their only Companion Desperation: These
Pierce are the Factors that make rich Satan's Commonwealth, who neither by
compulsion nor reason being brought to acknowledge their Maker, only confirm
themselves in Atheism, which is a Position as monstrous and unnatural, as it
is hard and uneasy to be established in the mind of any reasonable Creature.

Next learning thou peticionest against the Pride of Artificers, pride of
Artificers and gen^y.
where the needy Tailor will imitate the neat Nobility: Alas, a small
fault, if there were none proud, but Tailors, who being the impers of
Peacockes plumes may best borrow some of their broken feathers: but do but
cast thine eye aside, in after ages, and thou shall see a Water-bearer as brave
as a Sea*Captaine, and a Cobbler as curious in his acoutermentes, as on
Candlemas day at night, an Innes of Court Reueller, why he shall not be
accounted worthy of a trade, if he will not adventure more then half his
clear profits, to adorn his body beyond either his degree or vocation, and
some like the Duke of Florence fool, wear all their wealth on their ba^kes
only, but this excess being Male and Female, shall bring forth into the
world millions of prodegies, so that streets shall be pestered, Theaters
burdened, conuenticles ^lled, and Churches thronged with ga^dymen and painted
women, who like the kings of Mexico, shall have more several shifts of
clothes to adborne their bodies, then virtues to imbellish their minds, their
alms being god help you, and their bribes a cast suit or an once worn Reba^o,
these are they which shall metamorphize seruingmen to lackeyes, the love of
their neighbors to the lusts of their fond thoughts, great houses to a city
chamber, and good hospitality to ^ penurious misery, till bringing pearls
from America, Jewels from India, silks from Arabia, perfumes from Cataya, furs
from Muscouia, Monkies from Barbaria, Tobacco from Trinidada, ^ Fashions from
Italia, Fools from the I Will Cithaera, and lying kna^es from Creta, they as
lauishly spend as they unconscionably got, till shaking hands with beggary
they make their last wills and Testaments in the bottom of some dungeon,
whilst those unworthy creatures that rise by their downfalles, start up into
their promotions, and make a scoff of them by whom they were formerly advanced:
these and a thousand more such transuersions must be wrought before the worlds
dissolution, every nation is full of the worlds faults, nor shall they be
cleansed til the al-confuming fire of heaven purge and restore again the old
Chaos. Therefore Pierce content thy self with this, that the world cannot be
amended, till it be quite ended, for as years grow, evils grow, and men
always esteem that best, which is of the latest fashion.

Now to conclude, that Pride may be complete in Of En^^^*
all his proceedinges: there is sent into the world certain Furies of Hell,
who in the habites of Petty-foggers, or unlawful Lawyers, run about to
disturb Peace, and overthrow friendship, to break the bond of nature, and
the chain of allegance, by ringing in men's ^ares, the properties of mine and
thine, the beuty of commandment, and the glory of large possessions, that it
is fit either to be none, or else alone, That to imitate Princes, is to be
without Competitors, and hence it springes, that Envy being an Assistant with
Avarice sets all the world together, by the ears. These Ministers of the
infernal Kingdom, abusing Law with Law, and misconstruing the judgments of
most learned Sages, with the base corruptions of their muddie consciences,
these are they which have double tongs, and two* fold solutions, one for
private discourse, and an other for public profit, like the Athenian, who
having given two contrary resolutions of one question, and being taskt
therefore, replied, He had given the first at the Table, where was no profit.
The second at the Bar, where was both gain and glory.

Thus do they despise men's overthrows, and make a scoff of their own
wickedness: These are they that make as many rightes, as men have powers to put
chase and as many wrongs as there be emulous thoughts fit for contradictions.
These are they that maintain beggars to contend with the wealthy, that having
got them into their nets, they may make a pray of their riches: These when
Contentions grow irksome, spread forth the false roabe of arbitration, and
making themselves the vmpyers, prove conscience to be more coretously tedious,
then Law was bitter and wastefull, yea, their quirkes, their quiddities, their
judgments, reuerst by errors, their errors imagined, and not proved, their
tedious references, and their purchased reportinges, shall make men so run
mad with rage and coffeehouse, that even dispay^e shall swelt himself
with labor to instruct men how they shall be rid of the world and her
troubles: These with their contesting behauiours, and wrangling action, with
their clamorous voices, and vnblushing countinances, shall bring such a scandal
to that mest excellent corrector of vice, and fountain of reason, that the
very name thereof shall be as fearful to Wisemen, as the name of Talbot to
the French, or a Bugge-beare to an infant. Nor shall Envy spend all his power
upon these Subjects, but like a shape-chaunging Proteus alter every hour
with every several fashion, not so much but the Courts of Princes shall be
infected with his poisons: Nobility dreaming of Majesty, and statesmen how to
get noble Titles. Fools envying the preferme^ts of the Wise, and Wisemen
offended with the too much respect, that Fools have gotten: Flatterers shall
even gnaw their own hearts, to see plain dealing in authority, and plain
dealing shall with himself under ground, to see Flatterers become Pedants to
the choicest dispositions, nay, I will tell thee Pierce, when the highest
Majesty shall adorn thy Country with all these infinite and immortal
blessings, which never before were seen, so generally to flourish over any
Nation, when he shall send a power that shall close up the Ianus of
domesticke garboiles, and unrevealed discontentments, that to a general war
shall bring an universal Peace, that to virtue shall bring honor, to desert,
reward, and to every several estate, his several advancement, even in those
days shall Enute be waking, and murmuring against his pleasures, railing at his
Followers, and making scoffs of those, whom his hand has graced, in the end
run headlo^g into those damnable protects of unnatural treasons that eue^
wickedness it self, shall be ashamed it was ever inverted.

Envy having thus glutted himself with illness, and brought his Agents to the
ruin, for which he preserved them, he shall then for his recreation take upon
him, the habit of a woman, and as a Tennis-court fittest for his pleasures,
bandie his balls up and down in women's bosoms. Hence shall it come, that
age and deformity, envying youth, and beauty shall fetch from Italy, France,
and the Low Countries, a second nature, which though it be bastard and
abortiue, yet shall it be royally entertainde, as the goodliest Creature,
covering wrinkles with Ceres and Cinaber, and bald heads with golden
Periwigges, or brown Gregoryans, having this virtue that though all the sins
of their lives be repeated before them even in plain and vnglosed Phrases, yet
shall they no more blush or seem to be ashamed, then at the reporting of a
tale out of Orlando, or a Sonet out of Ports or Stella. Hence shall come the
alteration of Attyres, the new* fanglenes of fashions, and the mask-like
disguises of intemperate spirits, this day envying to morrow, and the morrow
envying the day that ensues it, and all but to this end, that making themselves
by their disgrace, gracious in the eyes of their Favorites, they may enuiously
confound them, and themselves together: nor shall this poison be particularly
bounded within any restrained lymit, but shall in such universal sort be cast
over the whole world, that the Court, the City, and the Country, shall go
together by the ears,, which shall be renowned for pryme invention. As for
foreign Envy* home-practises shall witness, I mean the Envy of Rome only,
where ^urther keeping an Apothecaries shop, compoundes Medicines, to impoyson
all Christians. Oh were it not for the bloody doctrine of that Church, Hell had
wanted a great number of her chiefest Burga-Maisters.

Next after Envy, thou complaynest of this minds perturbation, Wrath, who
being not so great as Envy, Of ^^ath.
is yet in his Nature, as busy to advance the dignity of Limbo, as any of the
former, not like Envy, looking only alost at stars and hie obiectes, but
like a more humble slave of sin, neither regarding persons, nor degrees,
makes all things his pray with whatsoever he encountreth, he is no Dwar^^e,
nor is he of swarthie visage yet indeed he is chollericke and of a hasty
nature, displeased both with right and wrong, both with war and peace full
proceedings, he has as many shapes as the former, and does change his vizardes
as often as great men their resolutions, nor man his evils be taken from the
earth till the golden age be brought back, and Saturn and Ops restord to
their old commandment: he sometime looks like to a Bedle, that whippes
beggars out of the street and charity out of men's bosoms, banishing with the
sight of the needy the remembrance of commiseration, whilst the right vagabond
indeed with a brazen face of ostentation ouercomes the bedle, and over braues
the Constable.

Another while he walks like a promoter buying and selling for 6. pence a
pe^ce the whole volum of the pennall statutes, but if once he be crossed or want
but two pence of his reckoning, then does he rage like a wild-boare and lays
his soul to paw^^^hel* by perjury rather the^ loose one jot of his reuengement.
He has the garments of a City magistrate, and then he cries revenge against
all that stood betwixt him and preferment shadowing cruelty under the law,
malice under upright government, and* inexcusable, injustice under want of
better information, sometimes he is in a country justices garments, and then
woe unto all that be of a contrary faction, for then they look not into men's
estates but into their loves, not what they are able to spare, but with whom
they are most willing to spend, and then they lay subsidies on the poor, great
loans on borrowers, and strong troubles on weak resisters, who shall go to
the wars but the son of the widdowe, the steward of the aged, or the
bridgroome that coming from the church is but newely married. But rests
wrath thus? No, he has in every degree a several design, and though not in
this present age: yet in times past he has been seen to sit inscarlet,
from whence even to the dunghill he has spread the venom of his nature, and
is no way to be apeased but either by the silver Image of some of the Lords
anointed, or with the cordyall luster of some golden Angels, both which have
power to appease anger and to insinuate freindshippe where hate was the
extreameliest conceived: after wrath has thus severally transformed himself,
he shall lastly take upon him the shape of a monster, and show himself more
ugly to the beholder then those which are seen in Nilus, or the Baboones in
sturbidge, for he shall have the head of an Ass, the body of a Toade, the
feet of an Asprea, and the mind of a Serpent, which form when he has taken
upon him he shall wholly give himself over to detraction and falling in hate
with all things, and al creatures despise whatsoever in the world is held comely
or decent, the ministry of the word shall not escape his reproof, but tasking
their charitable labors and despising their Doctrine, show the prophanes of his
poisonous rancor. Learning which only plucks the vizard from his ougly face
shall be spotted with his reproaches (yet cle^sed again by her own virtues) and
he that shines the fairest in the eye of the best judgments, shall the most be
assailed with his lies and defamatio^s, nay the arts shall not escape his fury,
saying Grammar is but an introduction to corruption: Lodgick a defense of
untruths, Rethoricke the beauty of sin, Music the ^awde to loosenes,
Arithmeticke an index for gross rememberances, history the storehouse of
treasons, and Philosopie the mother of cowardice: with a thousand such like
chimeras fit to issue from a hellish study, but of all and of all poor Poetry*
(yet is it not poor that is beloved of y^ muses) shall be a mighty block in the
way of his malice, as well because his guard is but nine women, whose arms are
not used to weapons as also for that some illiterat intruderes who never having
been acquainted with any high contemplation, shall administer to the world
matter of much scoff and foolery. To conclude there is nothing how ingenious,
how comely, how fit soever to be preserved for after ages, but this monster
shall detract, malign, and slander, and think thou then it is fit to call
such agents out of the world, the multiplication of whose seed shall make hell
an invincible monarchy, no they are predestinate to govern til the last day, at
what time they shall come laden home with rich spoils and great tryumphes, in
the mean space there shall go to consort with those furies the fury Gluttony,
with whom albeit thou seem to be mightily offended, yet so it is thou may
see an increase but no waneing of his mischiefs, Of Glutton^
for even as promotions rise so shall this mischief grow bigger and bigger, he
that with toil studies in the vniuer sitie shall with good cheer sleep in a
rich personage, and he that is painful in in^eriour places shall often prove
idle in the hyer offices so that gluttonye being made a coherent with Avarice
they shall suffocate the world with the smoke of surfeit and disorder. what
talkst thou of the Emperors of Rome or of their vicious and excessive
disorders in their too ^urious diets, descend thine eyes into ^ower times of
thine own rememberance and see if the triple ^round monarke of that fatal
City, do not make them temperate, and well dyetted princes in comparison of
his superaboundant fare, and intolerable magnificence, placing Peeters chair
at the upper end of feasts, and preaching abstinence with a full gorgde
stomach, whom one of his Disciples imitating, upon a vigil eve at night having
eaten for his own share a box of Marmalad, a pound of Eringoes, besides
preserved Cherries, Abricotts, ^ride Pears and Poumcitherous, fell into an
infinite and vncha^it able railing against the protestants whom he termed flesh
eaters and unhallowed, thanking. God that he had that night as well satisfied
him self with that ^lender repast as with all the flesh and gross meats in a
Princes kitchen, this was a fast fit for such a Saint, and thus does gluttony
riot even with him that calls himself Gods vicar from his example came the
abstinence of Cloisters who fast all Aduent, and eat nothing but chines of
porke, tripes and puddinges, a thin diet for a lazy devotion, and from them I
think the City took their observations, who beholding their teachers stray
so far from te^perance armed with their institutions, gave themselves ^^er
to all riot, all effeminacie, and all voluptuous and immoderate eating, making
all the feasts that either were instituted or invented by Solon, or Numa, not
comparable in the meanest degree with the weddinge of two beggars, or the
supper of one of the Bandetty upon his punke or Curtyzan. It is purposlesse for
me to tell thee the excess that shall arise in merchaunts, in governors, and
in hyer people, when even Theaters shall be turned to Pulpits, to inuay and
give example of their much riotousnes, and the super fluitie of their banquets,
shall exceed the immoderate feast, wherein Alexander was poisoned at the
City of Babylon: there shall not be an Alphonso heard of, that will live a
whole day with one Apple, nor a Diogenes that will sustain Nature with a
Carret root or a Parsenippe: There shall be no more Molynes, that will exchange
the State of Princes, to become Capuchine Friars, For gluttony shall alter all
those Lectures and write, Ne quid nimis on every great Man's Table: so that
surfeites sooner then swords, shall bring ^oules in heaps into the infernal
kingdom: nor shall Gluttony there rest satisfied, but sending his Handmaide
Drunkenness forth of Spruceland, Danske and Belgia, Of drunkenness
shall overthrow more, and work greater disorder then all the feasts that
either has, or hereafter shall be invented and that she does the shall do with
so good a grace, and with so amiable and facile a dexterity, like a venetian
fire-maker or a refined traveler, there shall nothing ^e held commendable that
is not graced with her fashions. Truth shall be held doubtful if not delivered
from a drunken utterance, freindship shall not be embraced i^ it be not bound
with a drunken obligation, nor shall service have his meritt if drink be not a
witness to the protestation. To be brief to drink drunk shall be as usual as
good morrow in a morning, good even after noone, and God save you at a high way
encounter, for there shall be no health, no service, no^ no good wish which shall
pass cum priuilegio, if it come not so often from the bottom of a full boule,
that in the end the well wisher for want of sense drop under the Table: this is
a notable project for helles enriching, when the folly of blind men will
attribute false titles of glory to the ^ugliest sin that is preserved in the
kingdom of darkness and to repute themselves then the best men when they are
worse then the basest that ever was created. Thou ^elst me of the laws of King
Edgar for repressing this vice and keeping men within the compass of
moderation I tell thee there shall be edicts publishst of greeter power and from
a better wisdom from a King of all complete perfection and full of infinite
detestation of these loathed abuses, yet these s^ie insinuating Furies, shall
have so many labory^^hes and Fore holes, to cover their maskte vildenes, that
they shall never be quite banished, whilst there hanges a Garland before a
Tavern, or a wispe at an Alehouse.

The laws of Drunkardes thou have repeated, and no doubt but they shall be
much amplified in the next conuenticle of sins, and for the Species of
Drunkenness, thou hast*said as much as can be reported, yet must they still
continue in the world, some as Sirens, to entice strangers, some as
Pedagogues, to instruct the not knowing, and some as Lacedemonian pictures, to
give a distaste and loathing to such brutish and beastly corruptions.

After all these shall press forth the old Beldame and nurse of these
mischiefs, inayle-footed sloth, who hating Of Sloth.
all virtue, because it is Laborious, shakes hands with Industry, and bidding
adieu gives himself over unto all inst and sensuality* from whence there
proceeds a thousand worse evils, then those which thou taskest: for if an
idle drunkard, a baudy humorist, or a vagra^t vnthrist, were the worst fruits
that Iolenes could produce. Then the Dropsy; the Pox and the Gallows, would
like good Physicions soon purge the body of the commonwealth, of such solid
yet weak obstructions* neither would the infection be so mortal, but the
smallest Antydote of virtue might preserve the weakest judgment from
perishing: but there be greater damnations begot by this Idleness, for when it
once takes possession of a great spirit, and a ready wit, like the Positions
of Machiuel. It obscures the remembrance of heaven, and castes virtue* into the
Lake of Oblivion and then my young Master siittes, with his hat ever his eyes;
and in one hour, sendes his thoughts Post over all the worlds Monarchy,
which once again returning into his bosom, find particular faults, with all
they have suruayde in their wandering co^templation: There is no Religion but
they will confou^d it, no government but they dislike it, no authority but it
is too austere, no Freedom but it is too remiss, nor no customs but they
shall be broken: Kings are with them either Stocks or Blocks, and the
necessary Officers of a wall builte commonwealth, are with them but as a
heap of Ciphers, without any figure, they will have laws, but they shall not
punish, they will have rule, but it shall observe no order, and they will have
all things in good fashion, yet nothing without confusion. Hence does spring
treasons, Massakers, and surprises, the sale of duty, and the sack of
Cities, the Creation of murder, and the cry of Innocents.

And hence does spring those e^ecrable Positions, which making reckoning of no
God but their breath, nor no Heaven but the contentment of their o^ne
affections, throw into the world as many blasphemies, as Northern blastes
throw parcht leaves on the ground after Autumn. One says, all love must be to
a man's self, or for a man's self, and not to trust at all, is the only way to
keep a man from deceit and circumvention, that rich promises must be seconded
with poor performances, that honesty and dishonesty are of equal estimation
so they serve in their needful offices, that to give reward to the well
deserving, is to loose the benefit of deserts to come only by false hopes
like the Syrene still to entertain Ulysses, that a thankful nature is as
great a clogge to a Wiseman, as an execution to a poor Debtor, that unseen
dissimulation is better then plain dealing, that it matters not for men's
affections, so they gain men's services, that forbearance is the best reuenew,
if in the end it gain what it expects, with a world of other, as to oppose
truth in an adversary, to despise the distressed, to make sale of justice, to
take bribes by vnderfactors, that it is virtue enough to gain an opinion to be
virtuous, that zeal is a hidden rock in a rough Sea, that that Religion is
best that best fitteth man's purposes; that men of the sword are like
Physicians or their vrinalles, good but in extremity, that to keep hie
spirits from rising, is to keep low thoughts from doubting, are not these
Rules of a religious disposition? Why, this is the fruit of sloth, when it is
companiond with hatred, contempt and man's weakness, and even from this sin
issues more scandals, more reproves, and more defamations to common wealths,
the^ from all the other, percedent furies,: therefore how busy soever she be
in the world, yet in hell she has the quietest lodging with the greatest
torment.

Now in conclusion like a bynding fillet to knitt together all those disorders
which best order the Devils palace thou complainst of Slothes fairest
daughter, the mind -- enchanting O^ Lechery
Lecherye, she that with a burning desire overthrows reason and with a furious
and vnrestrainde apetite murders all the good motions of man's mind and leaves
no monument or place where virtue was acknowledged whom although
sterue-gouerning Philosophy reports to be a pleasure bought with torment, a
delight be got with unrest, a content companiond with sear, and a sin that
has his ending in lamentation. Yet is she a necessary minister of hell and
the devils only Lumbard who takes most souls for interest what though wisemen
say she is a thief to the purse, a disease to the body, a rotte to the mind,
a consumer of the wit, a madder of the senses, and a mortal poison to the
whole fabric of man's composition, yet is she pleasant even in the depth of
perdition and like a lodestone directs men with desire to ruin and
destruction, yet is not her powerfulnes shown as thou suggests in shorditch
Curtezans, or Southwarke brothels, not in base persons, nor in known
Burdelios, those places be rather Lacedemonian tables which with lively
pictures and demonstrations present to wandering eyes, such ou glines, such
loathsom^es, such terror, such affright, and such abomination, that if there
be left in the heart of man but one half liueing spark of grace, if there be
in him but the shadow of shamefastnes, but one touch of honor, but one pecce
of a cleanely thought, if he desire to be but in the lowest degree of virtue,
and not to be the worst of all that are accounted vicious, he cannot choose but
in beholding their shamelesnes grow either utterly to detest ^r at least to
forbear the pollution of such noisome and stinking excrements, so that these
publiquc, known, and noted damnations, confound none but such as were in their
natiuities long before damned for a thousand worse iniquities. The pride of
lusts government and the conquest of her charms consists in greater and more
subtle objects, such as have modesty in their looks, chastity in their
behauiours, and heaven in their words, that publish fasts for humility, prayer
for exercise, and learning for a defense against inchastitie, those that wear
a deaths head upon their finger, that go to their bedds as unto sepulchers,
that meditate on the general judgment, and measure the pains of Helles
infinite torments, these when slothes child does inchaunt with her
lasciusousnes she makes Wisdom wonder, and weakness imitate the follyes of
their affections, these are they that enrich Hell, and minister unto the world
matter of infinite discoursing: These are they that in the most beutious work
of nature, in the richest embroderie of Art, that under the Crown of Honor,
the sphere of innocence, the protection of severe education, and all that ever
can breed reverence or admiration, lap wantonness in chaste garments, and
imaginary silence, deluding themselves with these Principles, That sin is no
sin, being either shadowed with greatenes, authority, or concealment.

Hence came the first invention of those skinne-coates, or artificial
vissardes, wherewith now a days is clothed both youthful and decayed nature,
least according to the first preordination which ordained the face to be the
index of the mind by which should be defended or accusde all secret
consultations, there might nothing be left close or entire to the corrupted
conscience, it is not a Lais with public sale, but Helen with private stealth,
it is not a Clodius, but an obscure Anselmus, not a doting Dolabella, but an
insorcing Ajax, not a wanton Horace, but a lustful Ovid, that does either
enrich the world, or heap up infinite spoils in the kingdom of darkness:
wherefore Pierce even this sin and the other five, as they marched formerly in
thy Supplication, may neither yet be utterly razde from the earth, nor stolen
from man's memory, least the golden age turning back contrary to all nature,
there neither be left Subjects for idle pens, talk for fools, nor
habitation for the vicious, to the great surcharge of Hell, and impouerishment
of the earth, which shall hold no reasonable creatures, if they be not either
saints in their conversation, the worlds fools, or children not above the
age of seven.

Now to conclude that Pierce Pennilesse may find the devil as gratful to him as
in times past he was to the ^e^lous painter, and that thy want and poverty shall
not bring thee to too sudden a desperation even from these seven great trees
of damnation, and from the fruit of their branches from whence all evils both
known and concealed receive their taste, their relishe, and their season: shall
thou and every other Genius of learning whose crossed fortunes and neglected
virtues, have no other means or sustentation, then what shall issue from a
worn Pen, and a more wearied meditation, receive the merit of praise,
reward, and admiration? for why, there shall be such a poison spread through
that little world, where Poets have their mouings and every gilded
understanding shall so delight to tickle his itching sense, either with
Satirical bitterness, or lascivious beastliness, that albeit they see the very
image of their own thoughts and the pictures of their faces as lively as in a
crystal fountain, yet shall selfe-opinion so ouermaister their
acknowledgements and blindness make them so misinterpret the colors of their
souls garments, that as if May-games were to be preferred before the
Triumphs of Princes, the blasphemies of Brothelles, before the Orations of
Demosthenes, and the story of Gollart, before the commentaries of Caesar they
shall give no merit, no praise, no satisfaction to any thing that is more
solid then an Attomie or mors moral then a plowmans salutation the reason
being that those for the most part which should give learning his right glory
and with their bounteous hands uphold the muses in their all peaceful
contemplations, are so utterly illiterate, and so scornful to acknowledge the
antipathie betwixt them and pure science, that accounting al things ridiculous
which are not molded in Barbarism, and all writings ridles which are not
drawn from Purilis they ^o like Jack Cade and his companions think themselves
and others best spoken when they speak nothing but their mothers language
Hence proceeds the contempt of learning, the disgrace of wisdom, and the
burial of the muses hence shall it come to pass that the lofty Poem wherein
the soul of art shall be celestiallie infused, and the rare amazing passions of
life stirring tragedyes shall be both neglected and unrewarded, whilst wanton
Clio in her comicke lasciuiousnes usurping upon the entertain of her
ill-iudging favorites, shall spread such new fashions in the court of men's
unconstant affections, that animated by the applause of their enduring
sufferance, she shall like a Curtezan of the first defiling by use of evil,
make men think, there is no goodness, but the evil which so much she bosteth:
bashful modesty shall become blockish stupidity, and the serious labor of art,
shall be the weary tediousnes of the mind, all the grave subjects of virtue and
prowes, and at those noble histories which give eternity to the worthiness which
died in past ages, shall in th^se times be by h^^^^ng serpents banished from
public audience, and nothing allowed of which does not either move laughter by
imaginary wa^^o^nes, or by plain and gross vncleanlines, the Emperor
Maximilian shall have no linen breeches when he is dead to c^^^^ his nakedness,
nor shall the Lord of Mountaignes curiosity in concealing the private offices
of nature be alowd amongst our worldlings for any rule of decency, but even as
one of our Gallenists maintaind in a declamation, it shall be no shame to speak
any thing which nature does not shame to perform be it never so great
secretnes, out of this applause and sufferance shall most famous wits even
such as are able io enchaunte Angels with sweetness to move senseless trees
with admiration and to make adamantine Rocks melte with the hearing of their
passions desist and break off from their more serious studies wherein the
grauer Muse had wont to exercise, honorable love, immortal prowess, or
divine meditation, and fall to display the vulgar humors of dejected natures
whose excelling illness being decyphered by excellent wits which make the
vildest subjects glorious by there handling shall so please h^^ the accademies
of Arts and Fashions that others less power full seeking to fly with their
feathers shall rippe up all the gra^es of Sc^^^^litie, and common market
places of ^^th(...)s, and there withal so over press and load all ears and
attentions, that as if there were nothing but folly, worthy the chronickling,
all virtuous actions shall be either forgot or vnspoke of. Hence shall it come
to pass, that sa^^dges which never beheld the true beauty of fair
buildinges, or ta^^ed the comfort of civil society, as ^auingledde wild
lives with disorder, riot, violence, and all barbarous (...)me^t, shall take
upon them like wissards or Pa(...) to understand or foretell all the
